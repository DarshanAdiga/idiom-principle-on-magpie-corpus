His snap accuracy on punts was a little down from 2018, but it's not something that will kill his chances.

When that turns, which gets to your question, is, I think, when market confidence comes back, when people begin to see light at the end of the tunnel, when markets recover, when you start to see a pickup in M&A volume. That’s when you’ll start to see a pickup for us in realizations. And at this point, because there is so much uncertainty around what’s going to happen in the reopening of the economy and the shape of the economic recovery, that certainly feels early to call that exactly. But when it does happen, things can turn, and then we can start to sell things again. But right now, I think in the near-term, as we’ve said, realization should be fairly limited.

After giving Carson Wentz a playmaker, the Philadelphia Eagles drafted his backup.
 The Eagles selected Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts in the second round of the NFL draft on Friday night, a stunning move for a team with more pressing needs.
 Then they took Davion Taylor, a hybrid safety-linebacker from Colorado, in the third round with the 103rd overall pick.
 Philadelphia hoped it filled a big void in the first round, taking TCU wide receiver Jalen Reagor with the 21st pick. But the team passed on other receivers and defensive players to add Hurts at No. 53.
 "Quarterback is the most important position in sports," Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman said. "We have shown how we feel about Carson by our actions, by the amount of picks we put into him, and we showed it by the contract extension. We believe this is the guy to lead us to our next Super Bowl championship. But for better or worse, we are quarterback developers. We want to be a quarterback factory."
 Hurts transferred from Alabama to Oklahoma and became a Heisman Trophy finalist last year when he threw for 3,851 yards and 32 touchdowns.
 "The opportunity to go there, be part of the organization, it's surreal," Hurts said about playing in Philadelphia. "It's an opportunity to grow, learn and be best quarterback I can be. I'm ready to go to work. I've always been about the grind."
 Hurts will provide insurance for Wentz, who started 16 games last season and led the Eagles to the NFC East title but was knocked out of a wild-card playoff loss to Seattle with a concussion.
 Wentz, the No. 2 overall pick in 2016, helped Philadelphia secure the NFC's No. 1 seed in his sophomore season but tore two knee ligaments and watched Nick Foles lead the Eagles to the franchise's first Super Bowl title. Wentz injured his back in 2018 and Foles stepped in again and led the team to a playoff win.
 Roseman said he spoke with Wentz about picking Hurts earlier in the day. Wentz, who finished third in NFL MVP voting in 2017, signed a $137 million contract extension last season.
 "We think Carson is a phenomenal player and nobody is going to be looking at a rookie quarterback taking over for a Pro Bowl quarterback who was on the cusp of being an MVP," Roseman said.
 Hurts, 6-foot-1 and 218 pounds, led two elite programs to the College Football Playoffs and put up big numbers both passing and rushing. His passing accuracy and consistency were the biggest questions entering the draft.
 Hurts went was 38-4 as a starter, including 26-2 for the Crimson Tide and was the Southeastern Conference player of the year as a freshman. Then he was benched at halftime of the national championship game against Georgia, with Tua Tagovailoa leading the comeback victory and ultimately winning the starting job for the 2018 season.
 "He has uncanny toughness, poise and competitiveness," said Andy Weidl, the team's vice president of player personnel. "He's a natural leader. His starting record speaks for itself."
 Hurts is Oklahoma's third quarterback drafted in three years. Oklahoma is the only program to ever produce quarterback selections in the first two rounds of the draft in three consecutive years — Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray went No. 1 overall each of the last two years. No school had ever produced quarterback picks in the first five rounds of the draft in three straight seasons.
 Hurts had 9,477 yards passing and 80 TDs with a 65.1 completion percentage in his four-year career at Alabama and Oklahoma. He also rushed 614 times for 3,274 yards and 43 TDs.
 Eagles coach Doug Pederson said the team would explore ways to use him with Wentz and mentioned the way New Orleans features Taysom Hill.
 "He's a great runner. He can throw on the run. He has a unique set of skills that we're going to look at it," Pederson said.
 Hurts wouldn't get into any specifics about his conversations with the Eagles.
 "I have no idea what's going to happen," Hurts said. "I don't put a ceiling on myself or my game."
 Taylor, 6-foot and 228 pounds, had an unusual path to the NFL. He only played in two games in high school because his family observed the Seventh-day Adventist Sabbath on Friday nights.
 Taylor had two 60-tackle seasons at Colorado and starred in track and field, where he posted a 10.51 time in the 100-meter dash at the PAC-12 championships.
 He was impressive at the Senior Bowl and the NFL scouting combine and again at CU's pro timing day, where he trimmed a tenth of a second off his 4.49 time from Indianapolis in the 40-yard dash.
 The 5-foot-10, 206-pound Reagor averaged 14.2 yards on 43 receptions and had five touchdowns last season. He also returned two punts for scores. Reagor had 148 catches for 2,248 yards and 22 TDs in 39 college games.

I think both manufacturers are prepared to get up and running, but there's the sub suppliers and I think there are some issues across the border with Mexico and some other places that folks are working through. I think that's probably the biggest issues that they have right now, besides obviously smaller order boards, okay. So when they do come back, I would expect rates to be down - build rates to be down, but that's indicative, there’s no difference where we would expect normally in this type of time as part of the cycle.

Hi, great, thank you. Most questions have been asked here. I just had one on the potential for acquisition opportunities at the firm level. We’ve obviously seen an abrupt drop in asset prices. I think that’s impacting virtually all types of asset managers here.

And so I’m just curious if you’re seeing anything at this point and whether you would expect that there might be some opportunities that actually come out of this for Blackstone at the firm level.

So when you talk about mass testing, you’re moving into the zone where you’re testing lots and lots of people so that you get that sense because it’s true that everyone around you is really in the clear and the people who test positive are asked to go home and isolate themselves. It’s a pretty simple concept. And the only question is, how do you stand that up and who’s in charge of that. How much money does it take, which is a very large amount of money. And then to do that with large amounts of money, the $25 billion would not do that throughout a country the scale of the United States. That you get your workforce so much more productive, it would actually, I think, pay off. And so what you’re seeing now is sort of – I think it’s fair to say, sort of a scramble. With many different types of tests from antibody test to the regular COVID, are you positive or not, where you have the swab.

So in the interim, the best way to make people comfortable is to have testing sufficient so that you know that the person to your left and your right is okay, and you’re not going to get sick. And the only way to do that, more or less, other than distancing yourself from them, which is a little unpredictable, is to test people sufficiently that they know that they’re okay. And without going into all the medical types of stuff of how long the incubation periods are because just testing sick people is one way to go, but there are many people who are asymptomatic who can infect you anyhow, and they will test positive if you test them.

Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos remains confident of his long term future at the club, despite growing reports he could be sold.
 The Spanish international is on a season-long loan at Arsenal, after slipping down the pecking order at the Santiago Bernabeu.
 The Gunners are keen on keeping Ceballos on a permanent deal, with Los Blancos valuing the former Sevilla man at €40M.
 However, Ceballos appears determined to return to Madrid, with the 23-year old confident of a place in Zinedine Zidane’s plans.
 “When I was in Madrid a few months ago, I spoke with Zidane. He told me he was happy for me getting minutes in England, he told an interview with DAZN, reported via the Evening Standard.
 “My relationship with him is healthy, and he knows I needed games to reach a consistent level.
 “He’s always said my future is at Real Madrid, and I need to be patient.”
 Despite his confidence over a return, Ceballos could stay in North London, if he is not offered a first team role in Madrid.
 Luka Modric, Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Federico Valverde are all ahead of him in the pecking order in the Spanish capital.
 But, with the coronavirus pandemic impacting Zidane’s transfer budget this summer, he could be in favour of Ceballos coming back.
 Achraf Hakimi and Martin Odegaard are both in line to come back, from Borussia Dortmund and Real Sociedad, as the French boss looks to boost his squad options ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.

Judging by their published responses to the absurdly labelled “peace plan” between the US and themselves, the Taliban have not been coy in declaring that they are of the same mindset and with the same objectives as when President Bill Clinton helped to install them in power in Kabul in 1996. Now a US President who claims to find the Clintons toxic is following in the path of the 42nd President of the United States. Should the Ghani government release even a fraction of the 5,000 jailed terrorists as demanded by both the Taliban and the US administration, it would be a catastrophe for Afghanistan. The Afghan National Army (ANA) is already facing a determined campaign by the ISI, the Taliban and the financial backers of the latter in the GCC. This well- funded drive is intended to secretly win over commanders, so that what took place in Iraq (when commander after commander of the Iraqi army surrendered to ISIS without a fight in 2014, thereby gifting Al Baghdadi vast territories, terrified citizens and stores of weapons) gets repeated in Afghanistan once US forces almost entirely leave the ANA to its fate. Giving back even a few such prisoners to the Taliban would ensure that their drive to generate treachery within the ANA picks up speed, even as morale falls to sub-zero levels. It would also cause panic among the moderate majority within the Afghan population, as the danger of a Taliban takeover arrives at their doorstep courtesy President Donald J. Trump. While Barack Obama at least sought to discern elements of moderation within the Taliban (in a search similar to that of bleeding hearts everywhere for “good” terrorists), Trump apparently does not care that his newfound friends are going to once again imprison women inside their homes, cut the throats of the tens of thousands who refuse to become their slaves and establish a harsh Wahhabi code of law and behaviour in Afghanistan. Should they come to know what her husband and father’s newfound allies have in mind for the women of Afghanistan, hopefully Melania Trump and Ivanka Kushner will make their distaste clear of this sell-out of human rights and values by President Trump, if nothing else.

As for the attacks on healthcare workers, these are reprehensible to say the least. So an ordinance that threatens a punishment for seven years and a fine of Rs 5 lakh for attacking healthcare workers should be applauded for its intent. But the malaise is much deeper. Health being a state subject, every state has enough provisions promising action against those who attack doctors. But that has not stopped doctors from being attacked. The problem, therefore, is of implementation. Too many attackers have been allowed to go scot free, for the message to go down that no such attacks will be tolerated and the harshest punishment will be given. Unless and until what is already available is implemented, this ordinance will not be of much use to prevent violence against healthcare workers. Also there must be sensitisation of the public that violence against doctors is both illegal and morally wrong. Unless and until there is an attitudinal change on the ground, all such ordinances will be futile.

A Fort Smith oil company executive is reassessing his business strategy during a catastrophic hit to the market in the wake of COVID-19.
   
 Hanna Oil & Gas President and CEO Bill Hanna said he is considering shifting from a business model based purely on drilling to one that acquires within the market as well. This is in part because his company, like many in the oil market, is in a good position to buy assets while the price of oil has plummeted due to a lack of all forms of travel worldwide during the pandemic.
   
 Hanna Oil & Gas produces oil in 11 states and three Canadian provinces but largely has a regional market.
   
 "You change and follow opportunities, and largely, they're everywhere," said Hanna, who is also the company's chairman of the board.
   
 Although Hanna's commodity prices for crude oil were up on Friday, the bleak outlook of the global market has impacted his and virtually every other oil business. Demand for gasoline since mid-March had declined by nearly half as of Thursday as airlines and domestic travelers all over the world have not used the supply during travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. U.S. oil futures on Monday fell below $0 as transportation requiring fuel has significantly slowed across the globe with travel restrictions.
   
 Canada is expected to drop its oil production by 15%, according to GlobalData.
   
 Hanna said natural gas prices even during normal market trends are "all over the place" and difficult to predict. This is compounded by a "perceived demand issue" and "an absolute, not-perceived supply issue" that have pushed market trends to where they are during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   
 "There's really only so many expenses you can cut out of the process that has any kind of material effects," he said. "I don't see this as an expense problem so much as a revenue problem, and we don't know how to fix that."
   
 Hanna said he and others in oil and gas have had to fall back on investments they've made when oil supply and demand were high. He said he hopes the price of oil "can go up eventually."
   
 But while Hanna waits, he may have opportunities to aggregate gas from other companies, he said. He said this is a shift from his longstanding company model that has focused solely on drilling.
   
 "We're opportunity-driven. We're entrepreneurs before anything else, and we're kind of business guys before anything else," he said.
   
 Hanna Oil & Gas hasn't laid off any employees in the wake of the pandemic, Hanna said. But he has encouraged them and investors to make sacrifices until the market recovers.
   
 But the investment community is also becoming scarcer than it already was, Hanna said.
   
 "It almost brings you together in an interesting way. You're down in a ditch, kind of fighting. It kind of brings you closer," he said.
   
 The possible acquisitions, Hanna said, could help his company in the long run and even after the pandemic is over.
   
 "Whatever we feel like puts us in a position to feel like we can provide a return for our employees and our stakeholders, we will do," he said.

 Aston Villa players will take a 25 per cent pay cut to help the English Premier League club during the coronavirus outbreak.
 "First-team players, first-team coaches and senior management have all agreed to defer 25% of their salaries for four months to assist the club during this period of uncertainty with a further review taking place at the end of this period," club chief executive Christian Purslow said in a statement.
 It was also announced that a U.K. National Health Service trust is to offer maternity care at Villa's home ground in Birmingham following the success of a similar connection with nearby West Bromwich Albion.
 The Sandwell and West Birmingham Trust said Villa Park's North Stand would host weekday clinics for expectant mothers and new parents from Monday.
 Meanwhile, Chelsea says it will not impose a pay cut on its first-team squad and instead will ask players to continue their support for charities during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Chelsea also said it will not be furloughing any full-time staff, and casual workers and match day employees are being compensated by the club through to June 30.
 The Blues have been in negotiations with their players about a salary reduction, reportedly around 10 per cent, in an effort to save money during the current crisis. That is lower than the Premier League's suggestion of 30 per cent for all clubs but Chelsea has now decided to take a different approach.
 Highlighting the PlayersTogether initiative launched by Premier League players earlier this month which aims to raise and distribute funds for National Health Service charities, Chelsea told its stars to focus their efforts on other causes.
 "Representatives of the Chelsea board have recently held extensive talks with the men's first team to discuss how they can contribute financially to the club during the coronavirus crisis," a statement on the club website said. "At this time, the men's first team will not be contributing towards the club financially and instead the board have directed the team to focus their efforts on further supporting other charitable causes."
 The British government is increasing planning with sports bodies about the resumption of events once the coronavirus national lockdown is eased.
 Government medical officials are involved in the talks about the logistics and health procedures required to allow sports competitions to restart.
 The Premier League last played a game on March 9 and has plans to try to restart from June 8 once pandemic social distancing regulations are relaxed to allow training to resume for teams and there are sufficient COVID-19 tests available.
 The national lockdown is currently in place until May 7.

Formula One driver Lando Norris embarrassed the field in his IndyCar iRacing debut by dominating Saturday's race at virtual Circuit of the Americas in Texas. Norris was poised to begin his second F1 season with McLaren in March when a team member tested positive for the new coronavirus at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and the series immediately suspended competition. The 20-year-old British driver is a skilled iRacer and competed in the virtual event for Arrow McLaren SP, an IndyCar team that McLaren partnered with for this season to enter the American series. Norris dominated qualifying to start from the pole and relinquished the lead during a pit stop. He then picked his way back through the 33-driver field on the virtual road course in Austin, Texas, and regained the lead with four laps remaining when Felix Rosenqvist spun. His victory snapped a three-race iRacing winning streak for Team Penske that included consecutive victories by Simon Pagenaud. Norris overcame a spin after his pit stops, then a challenge from Arrow McLaren rookie Patricio O'Ward. “It was a tough race especially Pato chasing me down on new tires at the end,” Norris said. “I didn't think I'd get back to the front after that spin.” Norris had more than 20,000 viewers streaming his race on the gaming app Twitch as he crossed the finish line — numbers that dwarf any of the regular IndyCar competitors. O'Ward gave Arrow McLaren a 1-2 finish, followed by Rosenqvist of Chip Ganassi Racing. “It was good, but man, Lando is quick in the SIM,” said O'Ward, who turns 21 in May and is re- adjusting to racing on a simulator after letting it sit idle during real competition. “I just got it back up and running ever since we started this iRacing challenge in IndyCar.

Bobbie Jeanette Harral Eastwood      Allen - Bobbie Jeanette Harral Eastwood, 79, most recently of Allen,TX left us Tuesday, April 21, 2020 to attend the ultimate craft show. We are pretty sure the angel earrings she so loved to make helped carry her there. Before moving to Allen she loved the 57 years she lived in San Marcos. She graduated from Southwest Texas State. She made many lifelong friends working at the San Marcos Telephone Company/CenturyTel for almost 35 years.      Bobbie was born November 1, 1940 in Corpus Christi, TX. She was very much adored by her parents Elmo Blackston and Ferne Marie Harral. She was proud to have been in the first class of Seniors to graduate from Carroll High School as Salutatorian. She and her friends spent many hours on the beach and water skiing while being pulled behind the boat the Bobbie J.      Bobbie left an impression on everyone she met with her quick wit and well- timed zingers. She was a mix of charm and feistiness who never met a stranger, with a larger than life personality. She was very generous and always willing to help those in need.      She loved attending craft shows and Market Days in Wimberley and enjoyed many years of selling her hand made wares and jewelry. She had as much fun selling stuff as she did visiting with almost every person in attendance. Give her a Thursday newspaper and she could plot the most efficient route to hit every Garage Sale listed.      She loved the Dallas Cowboys unconditionally and we all know what a feat that has been. She also loved the San Antonio Spurs and Halloween. She was a very proud Texan and loved the Texas Flag decor she had while she lived at LaVista in her later years in San Marcos.      She loved fishing and went on many deep-sea fishing trips with friends, many of whom worked with her at the phone company. She enjoyed staying at The Dunes condominiums in Port Aransas as often as she could. And if a poker game were to pop up in her presence she wanted to be dealt in.      She loved "playing in the dirt" as she called it and was always surrounded by beautiful flowers and plants. It can not be left unsaid that her love of TexMex Mexican food had no match.      She is survived by daughters Kimberly Eastwood and Michael Bowker, Kristy Eastwood Posey and Tom Posey. Grandchildren Samantha Posey Wenske and Luke Wenske, Mason Bowker and Austin Bowker. She told us to make sure that her faithful feline companion Reginald "Reggie" Utah Eastwood was also mentioned.

In February 2019, over 200 3A teams statewide started playing baseball. In June, there were only four playing and Van Alstyne was one of them.
   
 The Panthers were in the state semi-finals and lost a close one in the final inning at Dell Diamond in Round Rock.
   
 For many of this year's seniors, the goal was to return to that level, but that did not happen due to the cancellation of spring sports throughout the state.
   
 One of the leaders on the Panthers' team was the third baseman Zach Smith.
   
 Coach Jimmy Haynes, Van Alstyne High School's head baseball coach, said of Smith, "It's always hard to find a solid third baseman in high school baseball. Zach has been able to give us someone who is a hard-nose corner infielder - not only solidifying third base, but turned out to be one of the best pitchers that have come through our program."
   
 Zach grew up playing a variety of sports as a kid, including football, baseball, basketball and soccer. But baseball has always been his favorite.
   
 Looking back on his sports career, he said the memory of playing baseball in the tournament will stand out as the best memory.
   
 Playing multiple sports helped Zach become a versatile player on the football field.
   
 Van Alstyne coach Mikeal Miller spoke about the teen's ability to be useful all over the field.
   
 "He played three different positions and was very productive at all three. He is one of the best leaders we have had in our program."
   
 On Maxpreps.com's Panther site, Zach is listed as a full-back, wide-receiver and outside-linebacker. Those were his main positions and does not include the spots in which he served as a backup.
   
 Zach was the backup quarterback this season during a pre-district game against Anna in which he had to take over as quarterback. The following week, we learned that he played through an injury.
   
 When asked about his feelings concerning the loss of his senior season of baseball, he said, "It was super tough and still is, but it's just a `grip- and-gravity'-type of situation. It is out of my control, so I have to learn to slowly let it go no matter how hard it is. Life goes on."
   
 It doesn't take long while speaking to Zach to see that the impact on him of being a Panther goes well beyond just moments and memories.
   
 "I am glad I got to be a part of the athletics program here, which not only made me a better athlete but a better man through life lessons from coaches over the years."
   
 It was Coach Darrell Hardcastle who taught Zach about `grip and gravity.'
   
 "He taught me that if you can't control it, why try and hold on to it? You have just to let some things go that you can't control," the teen explained.
   
 Zach spoke about having the right priorities when it came to being a student- athlete.
   
 "I just had to have the discipline to tell myself sports wasn't the only thing, and that to be successful I had to apply myself in the classroom as well."
   
 When asked which teacher had the most significant impact on him, Smith named Van Alstyne High School English teacher Julie Thomas.
   
 "She always has room to be your friend no matter what is going on, and she genuinely cares about her students," he said.
   
 Zach shared about the influential role his parents, Greg and Joanna, have played.
   
 "They have played a huge role. No matter what I decided to do or the outcome of a game, they were proud of me. Their encouragement never stopped."
   
 When asked who his biggest fans were (besides his parents), the answer went outside of his house - but not far.
   
 "My extended family - they are always at every single one of my games right there to cheer me on," he said.
   
 Miller had high praise for Smith beyond his on-field abilities.
   
 "Zach is truly a servant leader. He is constantly looking for ways to serve others as a leader. Whether it's a younger player or someone who may be having a bad day or practice, he is there with a comment and confidence booster to help them out."
   
 The next chapter in Zach's life is yet to be determined.
   
 "I plan on playing college baseball somewhere as well as majoring in business management," the teen said.
   
 "I hope someone on the next level will give him a chance, " Haynes said, referring to colleges and universities. "They would be getting a solid player and a great leader in one."

Another concern raised by the cooperative department is the increased financial burden on the state government as farmers expect the CCI and the MSCCF to buy their stock at MSP to minimise their financial loss. “Inadequate cotton centres are pushing the small and marginal farmers to private players, who are taking advantage of their vulnerability and paying them peanuts. The farmers, who cannot withstand the delays and wants money, will be forced to sell cotton at a much lower price than Rs 3,000 per quintal, Now, it is the government’s responsibility to ensure maximum cotton centres under CCI and MSCCF resume work in full swing,” said Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavlambhan Yojna.

"articleBody": "
 A homeless mother lies in bed with her new born baby snuggled up beside her.
 Mom recently tested positive for COVID-19, but her new bundle of joy is virus- free.
 Toronto doctors recommended that mom and baby not be separated, in large part because studies have shown a low likelihood of COVID-19 transmission from mothers to babies during and after pregnancy.
 And weighing the pros and cons, it was decided that keeping baby and mom together was better for their bonding than separating them.
 Their room isn't in a hospital. Nor are they in a homeless shelter.
 They're in the city's new 200-bed COVID-19-positive recovery site for Toronto's homeless, a new hybrid model of care that's part of the city's $200-million effort aimed at helping homeless people during the coronavirus outbreak.
 The recovery site in Toronto's west end opened in mid-April and operates out of a major chain hotel the city is leasing during the pandemic, one of about 12 private hotels the city has already leased or bought to house the homeless during the pandemic.
 Most of the hotels were obtained by the city to facilitate social distancing between homeless people who aren't infected, and the city intends to lease 15 more hotels, motels or private highrise buildings for the same purpose.
 But the recovery site for COVID-positive homeless people is so much more than that. It's a unique collaboration between the University Health Network, the city's Shelter, Support and Housing Administration, Inner City Health Associates and community organizations Parkdale Queen West Community Health Centre and The Neighbourhood Group. All are co-leads on the site and recently signed a legal memorandum of understanding to work together and operate it.
 The organization Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontier Canada is also involved, providing expertise on project co-ordination and logistics when it comes to dealing with a large scale pandemic, given the organization's experience dealing with major outbreaks overseas, such as malaria and Ebola.
 Additional support is provided by community organizations Breakaway Addiction Services, LAMP Community Health Centre and Toronto North Support Services.
 Among the primary goals of the recovery site is treating homeless patients with dignity in a clinical setting and ensuring they have a home to go to afterward -- not a return to homelessness.
 "We need to commit to housing as a human right, not just for infection control but as a matter of health and human dignity," explained Dr. Andrew Boozary, the UHN's executive director, health and social policy, a social medicine lead who is involved in helping set up the recovery site. "The only lasting treatment we have is housing."
 "This isn't a hospital. People there don't require acute care. But neither is it a shelter because we have infectious disease protocols in place and wraparound health supports. It's a new model for the city's most vulnerable to recover in a dignified way," said councillor Joe Cressy, who chairs Toronto's Board of Health.
 "It's a critical piece of care, a critical new health resource," Cressy later added.
 Plans are in place for a second recovery site, this one also in a hotel but in downtown Toronto. It's slated to open in the coming days and will provide more than 250 beds.
 Earlier this year, as the virus took hold around the world, health care and housing leaders in the city began talking about the effect of COVID-19 on the city's homeless population.
 For example, Mary-Anne Bedard, general manager of the city's Shelter, Support and Housing Administration, spoke with physicians with the Inner City Health Associates, a group of more than 90 doctors working in more than 50 shelters and drop-in centres across Toronto.
 "We identified that there would likely be a high number of people testing positive because of the high contagion level of this virus.
 "Also people who got sick, but not sick enough to stay in hospital -- a lot just get flu-like symptoms -- if a lot of people from the shelter system … couldn't return to shelters because of their (COVID-positive) status, that was going to really overburden the health-care system in a way that wasn't needed because they didn't actually have to be hospitalized. But they have no other place to go," Bedard said.
 "So we recognized early on this (recovery site) was going to be critical -- not just because of the overburdening issue but also to make sure this clientele received the support they needed and felt comfortable with," Bedard added.
 At the recovery site clients have their own room, washroom, television, and they're delivered three meals a day and two snacks, visits that provide staff an opportunity to check in on the welfare of residents.
 As well as doctors and nurses, there are also community-based workers including peer support workers who've experienced homelessness and challenges with mental health and substance abuse.
 "We also check in multiple times a day by phone to see if they're OK or need anything. We also escort people who want to go outside to smoke, in an outside secure smoking area. It's another opportunity for social interaction with people so they don't feel too isolated," Bedard said.
 This week there were 105 COVID-positive residents at the recovery site. An additional 16 have recovered and been discharged, Bedard said.
 Staff in the site have full personal protective equipment and maintain a six- foot separation from clients during these interactions. Health-care staff doing blood pressure or heart monitoring, for example, come closer, but those are nurses and doctors who are trained on how to do those activities safely.
 Fine details to protect staff working in the site -- even down to the location of hand sanitizers depending on "low-risk or high-risk zones" -- have been worked out to ensure safe pathways, explained Dr. Andrew Bond, medical director at Inner City Health Associates.
 There's also a harm reduction component for residents at the site. That includes an on-site managed alcohol program and harm-reduction supplies for people who use drugs, Bedard said.
 Harm-reduction staff also provide crisis de-escalation and "trauma-informed" motivational interviews and other therapeutic approaches.
 The recovery site is "going incredibly well," said Bedard. "Nobody knew at the beginning how it was going to go. When there are multi-partnership arrangements like this, there's always a bit of nervousness."
 There are a variety of ways clients arrive at the recovery site. In concert with Inner City Health Associates, directives were developed and given to all the testing centres and hospital emergency departments in Toronto.
 When there's a COVID-positive test result for a homeless person at one of these facilities, there is a referral to the recovery site through an Inner City Health physician.
 There's also an isolation site in Scarborough where homeless people are sent to await their COVID test results. Clients are sent from there to the recovery site if they test positive, again with direction from an ICHA physician.
 There's a third group that can isolate at their home shelter where that's available. The homeless person remains there until their COVID test result comes back. If positive, the same co-ordinated referral process involving an ICHA physician is in place to move the person to the recovery centre.
 Transportation is provided by the city's fleet services.
 When it's time to leave, the recovery site team works on getting housing for people.
 That could mean going to one of the physically distancing hotels for homeless people who aren't infected. Hotels, rather than traditional housing, are used by the city because they are "quickly responsive" to surges and contractions in demand from the city, Bedard explained. It was easier for the city to secure hotels to deal with the coronavirus than it is under normal circumstances because many of Toronto's hotels were closed due to the virus.
 People leaving the recovery site might also be sent to a Toronto Community Housing unit or a private market unit with the tenant possibly accessing a housing allowance. There are also efforts to connect departing clients to outside case management support.
 "We recognized that discharge planning would be very important for this group. Even after you've recovered from COVID-19, you still have a vulnerable health status," Bedard said.

ATLANTA — As the global death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 200,000 on Saturday, countries took cautious steps toward easing lockdowns imposed amid the pandemic, but fears of a surge in infections made even some outbreak- wounded businesses reluctant to reopen.
 The states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska started loosening restrictions on businesses despite warnings from experts that such steps might be premature.
 Shawn Gingrich, CEO and founder of Lion's Den Fitness, decided after the Georgia governor's announcement that his Atlanta gym would remain closed for now.
 "We've sacrificed so much already," Gingrich said. "I feel like if we do this too soon, we'll see a spike in cases and we're back to square one."
 Others were eager to get back to business, with precautions. Russ Anderson, who owns a tattoo studio in south Georgia, said he "couldn't get up out of my chair quick enough" when restrictions were lifted. His main shop served 50 or 60 customers Friday when it reopened, with customers and tattoo artists wearing masks, he said.
 The worldwide death toll was at 201,907 as of Saturday afternoon, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.
 India reopened neighborhood stores that many of the country's 1.3 billion people rely on for everything from beverages to mobile phone data cards. But the loosening didn't apply to hundreds of quarantined towns and other places hit hardest by the outbreak that has killed at least 775 people in the country where many poor live in slums too crowded for social distancing.
 Shopping malls also stayed closed nationwide. Still, owners of small stores, being allowed to open again brought relief.
 "This is a good decision," said Amit Sharma, an architect. "We have to open a few things and let the economy start moving. The poor people should have some source of income. This virus is going to be a long-term problem."
 India also allowed manufacturing and farming to resume in rural areas last week to ease the economic plight of millions left jobless by the March 24 lockdown. The restrictions have allowed people out of their homes only to buy food, medicine or other essentials.
 Elsewhere in Asia, authorities reported no new deaths Saturday for the 10th straight day in China, where the virus originated. South Korea reported just 10 fresh cases, the eighth day in a row its daily increase was under 20. There were no new deaths for the second straight day.
 Underscoring the unknowns about the virus, the World Health Organization said "there is currently no evidence" that people who have recovered from COVID-19 cannot fall sick again.
 Some countries extended or tightened restrictions, confirming a pattern of caution.
 Sri Lanka had partially lifted a monthlong daytime curfew in more than two thirds of the country. But it reimposed a 24-hour lockdown countrywide until Monday after a surge of 46 new infections, its highest increase in a day.
 Norway extended until at least Sept. 1 its ban on events with more than 500 participants.
 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced that Spaniards will be allowed to leave their homes for short walks and exercise starting May 2 after seven weeks of strict home confinement, though he said "maximum caution will be our guideline."
 "We must be very prudent because there is no manual, no roadmap to follow," he said.
 Kids in Spain will get their first fresh air in weeks when a ban on letting them outside is relaxed starting Sunday. After 44 days indoors, they'll be allowed out for adult-supervised one-hour excursions no farther than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from home. They will not be permitted to play with others, and some nervous parents shopped online for child-size masks for them.
 "I really want to get outside, and Ema does as well," said Madrid resident Eva Novilo, speaking of her 7-year-old daughter. But Novilo predicted "difficult situations" if they see her friends and have to stay apart. "I don't know if we will be able to maintain control."
 Belgium sketched out plans for a progressive lockdown relaxation starting May 4 with the resumption of nonessential treatment in hospitals and the reopening of textile and sewing shops to make face masks.
 In Italy, where restrictions also will be eased May 4, authorities warned against abandoning social distancing practices as millions return to work. Free masks will be distributed to nursing homes, police, public officials and transportation workers. Workers painted blue circles on Rome's subway platforms to remind people to keep their distance when commuters return.
 The country continues to have Europe's highest death toll, with 26,384 deaths. The 415 deaths registered in the 24-hour period that ended Saturday evening was the lowest toll since Italy registered 345 on March 17, but only five fewer than Friday.
 With gatherings banned, Italians celebrated the 75th anniversary of their liberation from occupation forces in World War II, emerging on balconies or rooftops at the same time to sing a folk song linked to resistance fighters.
 Britain held off on changes to its lockdown as the virus-related death toll in hospitals topped 20,000. The figure doesn't include deaths in nursing homes, likely to be in the thousands.
 In France, the government prepared to ease one of Europe's strictest lockdowns from May 11. The health minister detailed plans to scale up testing to help contain any new flare-ups.
 Testing shortages also are a problem in Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, which is veering closer to becoming a pandemic hot spot.
 Officials in Rio de Janeiro and four other major cities warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse or already overwhelmed. In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said they have been forced to dig mass graves in a cemetery. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day — triple the pre-virus average.
 Along with Georgia, Oklahoma allowed salons, spas and barbershops to reopen, while Alaska cleared the way for restaurants to resume dine-in service and retail shops and other businesses to open their doors, all with limitations. Some Alaska municipalities chose to keep stricter rules.
 Though limited in scope, and subject to social-distancing restrictions, the reopenings marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging in the United States and beyond as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically devastating lockdown orders. A survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found Americans overwhelmingly support stay-at- home measures and other efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.
 On Friday, President Donald Trump spoke optimistically of the economy but also asked people to continue social distancing and using face coverings. He also signed a $484 billion bill to aid employers and hospitals. In the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 U.S. workers.
 Trump also said his widely criticized comments suggesting people can ingest or inject disinfectant to fight COVID-19 were an attempt at sarcasm.
 In Texas, where retailers are allowed to sell items for curbside pickup, Allison Scott said most customers of her women's clothing store in a Dallas shopping mall seem to feel more comfortable ordering online. Scott thinks it's still too risky to allow people to shop in person, and she can't see people wanting to.
 "I want to be open more than anything but I don't think that society is ready to come out either," she said.

Fort Smith Sportsman manager Trey Prieur is ready to hear two words that have left us silent since March 13.
   
 "Play ball!"
   
 Prieur is hopeful the city's legion team can salvage the summer if restrictions are lifted.
   
 Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced this week that a number of things we take for granted, including trips to the barber shop and sitting down in restaurants, will open up late this month and early in May.
   
 "We're hoping the first of June we'll be able to play ball; that's our mentality," Prieur said. "Obviously, that's going to come from the governor and his office if we can do it."
   
 Although there is no schedule in place, Prieur has spoken with other coaches, including those in Oklahoma.
   
 "I talked to Three Rivers and Bartlesville on a conference call about two weeks ago," he said. "They're planning on it. They're waiting on clearance from their facility."
   
 Prieur believes some of his squad has worked out on its own. But no live pitching or hitting will put players behind.
   
 "The good news is we're all in the same boat," he said. "It's not like this was just limited to our area. Everybody is behind. I know people are still able to get some work in, but not facing live action is completely different. It will take an adjustment, which is something we haven't seen before."
   
 Some of Prieur's potential players haven't played a meaningful game in almost 44 days.
   
 "Having six to seven weeks off is different," he said.
   
 Fort Smith boasted three legion programs last season. Prieur hopes to have at least two when they resume.
   
 "Based on the number of signups, and the craziness of it all, I think it would be better off for us to have two teams," Prieur said.
   
 Legion officials are expected to make a decision by June 1.
   
 "A lot of places have the go-ahead to play or not," Prieur said. "If the governor allows it, we'll still play, we just won't end the season with an end-of-the-year tournament."

Editor's Note: The following was submitted by Tod Dimmick.
 The pandemic has affected every community event this spring, including the annual New Life 5K Trail Run, an event that raises more than 20 percent of the New Life Furniture Bank's budget.
 This Massachusetts charity serves nearly 700 households every year, including individuals, families, single mothers, seniors and veterans, as they come out of homelessness. New Life collects high-quality gently used furniture and household essentials that are then made available at no cost to individuals and families in need.
 Faced with the challenge of having to cancel its annual 5K Trail Run, New Life sought creative and safe ways to hold their event, which raises funds that are critical to New Life's ability to serve its clients.
 "The economic impact of COVID-19 is hitting our clients hard," said Rich Purnell, executive director of New Life. He added that, "in the coming months, we anticipate a surge in requests as many families will be displaced from their homes."
 After careful thought, the trail run organizing committee announced a new "virtual 5K." Runners and walkers register the same way they would for a conventional run, at www.newlifefb.org/virtual5k, where they can also create or join a team. Participants create their own 5K route, or use fitness apps like MapMyRun and Strava. Teams or individuals may even choose to row 5K on erg machines, or to bike.
 Entrants complete their personal 5K anytime between April 13 and May 10, and runners and walkers log their times on Racewire. On May 11, results will be posted and awards will be given in traditional categories, as well as in new, creative categories like most creative course.
 Ron Yates, co-founder of the New Life Furniture Bank, said "we recognize that this is a totally new way to do something like this, and that is part of the fun. The Virtual 5K could bring even more people to the event because it is so easy to participate from anywhere, at any time. A team could be made up of family members, high school or college cross country teams looking for fitness and competition, an office group, you name it."
 The organizers also believe that the event offers an important opportunity for supporters who, especially in these challenging times, seek ways to do something positive and proactive while still being safe.
 "Folks joining the Virtual 5K not only support the New Life mission, they also are a welcome part of a community doing something that matters," said Yates. "That's especially important right now. And, running in the virtual 5K is a healthy thing to do. Everyone wins."
 Carmen Luisi of Holliston was the top female runner in the 2019 Trail Run (at age 13), and she's looking forward to the Virtual 5K this time around. "This is a very important cause, even greater now because people are struggling financially with the current pandemic," she said.
 Dan Haley of Wayland said he will run the Virtual 5K this year with his family.
 "My wife and 12 year old daughter and I had a wonderful time at last year's 5K," he said. "With everything in the near term shutting down, we were excited to hear that the New Life event is going virtual. One of our goals as a family as we navigate this strange, temporary reality is to continuously reach out to help others. Another is to keep getting exercise! So this checks both boxes, and gives us something worthwhile and active to do as a family."
 Mark Silva is a partner at the law firm Choate, Hall & Stewart LLP, a sponsor of the event. He plans to run the race for the first time this year.
 "At a time when we're all cooped up in our homes looking for something to do, looking for a way to help," he said, "the 5K is giving us the opportunity to support an incredible organization… while being completely flexible on approach."
 He added, "We plan on doing the 5K as a family this year - my wife will run and I am planning to bike the 5K with the kids."
 Kristin Chisum of Wayland will also run the Virtual 5K again with her son, Luke. "We are thrilled that the race committee has come up with a way for the race to go on," she said. "We live near the woods near Walden Pond so that's where we'll be."
 She added, "I know that we will finish our 5K again this year with a feeling of gratitude - thankful for this group of people that have found a way to change people's lives and have provided this 5K as a way for us to do our own little part."
 Participants in the New Life Virtual 5K will be encouraged to post photos of their participation with the hashtag #NewLifeStillRunning or send an email to trailrun@newlifefb.org.
 The registration page reads, in part, "It is our hope that sharing everyone's fun photos and stories will bring joy to our New Life community and inspire other people far and wide to join the cause."
 The organizers made it clear that they want more ideas from supporters about how to make the event fun and accessible to all. Ideas are coming in already, including filming clips of virtual bystanders cheering on the runners, and asking kids to create colorful yard signs.
 The Medfield-based not-for-profit organization operates a donation center in Walpole, and serves MetroWest and greater Boston.
 To register, go to www.newlifefb.org/virtual5k. Those interested in being a sponsor or making a financial contribution are encouraged to visit www.newlifefb.org.

Washington has changed during the pandemic so far – but not in the ways you might think, and not quite as much for a city bound by tradition. But could Washington change the country in the long term once the virus has ebbed? A 21st-century version of the New Deal could showcase federal power and remake the American landscape much as its predecessor did, though in different ways.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a pair of lawsuits late Friday calling for a dramatic reduction in California’s incarcerated population and a halt to all transfers of inmates to federal immigration detention centers amid increasing signs throughout the U.S. that jails and prisons are hot zones for the spread of the coronavirus.
 The suits filed with the California Supreme Court name Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra and come as the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego and Lompoc penitentiary in Santa Barbara County have become home to some of the worst outbreaks in the federal prison system. In the lawsuits, the ACLU argued that outbreaks behind bars pose threats not only to the incarcerated, but also the families of jail and prison employees.
 “It is not just those confined to jails, detention centers, and youth facilities who are in danger,” Peter J. Eliasberg, chief counsel of the ACLU in Southern California, said in a statement. “Once the virus gets inside, the regular movement of staff and visitors in and out means that walls and razor wire can neither slow nor stop the viral spread to communities at large.”
 The suits argue that social distancing is almost impossible in immigration detention centers and California jails and prisons, where many house inmates in close proximity, with showers and meal areas that are communal.

Hey, good morning, guys. So there’s been some – a lot of anecdotal reporting about PE firms kind of segmenting their portfolios into buckets like green light, yellow light, red light, or in other words, companies that are fine, companies that are okay, but might see a little weakness and then companies that are clearly not fine. Have you gone through a similar exercise? And could you help maybe frame the exposure across PE and real estate in each of those buckets or similar buckets? However you’ve thought about it?

In a civilised society, violence is a word that should be taboo. Never can violence be the answer to settling differences, however deep the disagreements might be. Nor can violence be a means of venting fear and suspicion, when there is a law and order machinery in place. Two incidents, rather one incident that took place this week and one trend that has been developing over the past several weeks were disturbing, to say the least. One was the attack on a well-known journalist and his wife by goons belonging to a political party and the other is the violence being meted out to healthcare professionals by people misled by wild rumours and pathetic superstitions about the treatment of coronavirus. In the first instance, India’s political parties need to understand that no one is above criticism, however high and mighty any political personality might be. And it’s the media’s job to criticise and ask questions and hold those in public life accountable for as much as their inaction as their action. In this particular case, the political activists who attacked the media personality’s car allegedly belonged to the youth wing of the Congress. It’s obvious that they thought it fit to carry out the attack to protect the name of their acting party president. But through their hooliganism they brought calumny to their party and their seniors. In this context, it must be mentioned that this sort of intolerance is not exclusive to the Congress. Most political parties are guilty of it, if not all. Of course in the dynastic set-up of the Congress, any slight to the Family is taken very seriously, with young workers taking it upon themselves to protect the name and honour of their presiding deities. The affliction is perhaps not as great in other parties. However, almost all parties are adept at filing lawsuits and FIRs all over the country against anyone who dares to stand up to them, with the aim to tangle that person in years of legal battle. And this utter misuse of the legal process is taking place in this journalist’s case as well, with a clear message being given that anyone saying anything against the First Family will be hauled over coal. Obviously, Congress may have lost its importance in Indian politics to a large extent, but not its arrogance—in fact its arrogance is one of the reasons why it is in such dire straits in the first place. Also, it must be investigated if any senior leader was involved in instigating the attack on the journalist and his wife. The least that Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray can do is allow a fair probe, without fear of being hauled up by his alliance partners. The attack on the journalist amounts to muzzling of the press and must be condemned and the Congress party must distance itself from its workers who carried out the attack with the intent of doing bodily harm.

This pandemic is cutting through our lives in two ways, putting us on edge since, as seniors we are age-compromised, and going beyond ourselves, have lost loved ones to this disease. In addition, there are the caregivers, the heroic medical staff, folks who are often putting their own health in jeopardy to be of service.
