Germany is playing the Czech Republic, but it's really battling apathy among its fans. Last month's friendly against Turkey drew the lowest TV ratings for a prime time national team game this century and Germany is on a run of four draws in five games. Disputes over who to pick have led to what team director Oliver Bierhoff called "a dark cloud" over the team. Germany will field a weakened team against the Czechs. Leeds defender Robin Koch will start while several players sit out before returning for Nations League games against Ukraine and Spain. German fans are lukewarm about the Nations League too. Germany was meant to be relegated in the 2018-19 competition, but was reprieved when UEFA changed the group structure. The Czech team reported positive coronavirus tests for two players ahead of the game. Both players are in isolation.

After Eden Hazard was quarantined in Madrid because of a COVID-19 infection and several Belgian players were ruled out because of injuries, FIFA's top- ranked team finally received good news when Romelu Lukaku was given the green light to travel to Belgium. There were concerns the former Manchester United striker could be stuck in Italy at Inter Milan because of coronavirus travel restrictions. Lukaku recently came back from a leg injury and it's still unclear whether he will feature in the friendly match against Switzerland. Belgium will then face England and Denmark in the Nations League. There is also a glimmer of hope Hazard could join his teammates at a later stage as the Belgian federation said he just need a negative test to be allowed in the group. Switzerland will be without Nice defender Jordan Lotomba, who tested positive for COVID-19 alongside a medical staff member.

ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans are making more demands of Georgia’s chief elections officer as they seek to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s 12,000-vote lead in the state's presidential race.
 U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, who’s leading President Donald Trump's recount team in Georgia, and state Republican Party Chairman David Shafer sent a letter to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Tuesday requesting that he order a hand recount of Georgia's nearly 5 million ballots before certifying the results.
 The move comes a day after Republican U.S. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler called for Raffensperger's resignation, claiming he ran the election poorly but citing no specific incidents of wrongdoing. Perdue will face Democrat Jon Ossoff and Loeffler will face Democrat Raphael Warnock in Jan. 5 runoffs that are likely to determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
 Raffensperger has refused to step down and defended how his office conducted the election. His office has refuted a number of claims made by Trump supporters.
 “The process of reporting results has been orderly and followed the law,” Raffensperger said in a Monday statement. “Where there have been specific allegations of illegal voting, my office has dispatched investigators.”
 “This is not about anything but a fair process and election," Collins said in an interview with The Associated Press. “This is not about sour grapes. It’s not about anything else. It’s just about saying, let’s restore the integrity, because we’ve got more elections here in Georgia in a very short time.”

Like most Marines, John probably does not think of himself as a hero. Perhaps his action was born from a feeling of invincibility that is inherent in most young Marines. Regardless of the reason, he acted with courage and selflessness. I believe that he unconsciously knew he had to act — to do the right thing.                                  John did not know any of the rescued civilians’ names, nor could he even speak their language — there was nothing inherent for him to act from a purely relational perspective. What John Blodgett did know — or, more aptly, who he was — led him to act. He was a well-trained Marine with the hallmarks of discipline and spirit. He knew what his profession expected — what it demanded. He knew that civilian lives were at risk and, for that reason alone, he acted to save them at his own peril.                                  When the war was over, the secretary of the Navy said in John’s medal citation that “... Staff Sergeant Blodgett’s exceptional professionalism, unfailing good judgement and extreme devotion to duty to his fellow Marines reflected great credit upon himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.” He also authorized John to wear the coveted Combat Distinguishing Device on his medal.                                  John Blodgett is a hero. Take some time out of your Veterans Day this year to thank the countless, unrecognized John Blodgetts for their service and sacrifice that serves to set an inspirational example for us all. You won’t have to look far. They are your next-door neighbor or live across the street — yet their heroic sacrifices that often are underappreciated stretch around the world. May their legacies live forever.                                  Montani Semper Liberi, and may God bless America.

There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia. However, regardless of whether the presidential race is audited, Trump could likely request an optional recount. State law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden's lead stood at 0.25 percentage points as of Tuesday afternoon.
 Collins and Shafer also requested that election officials recanvass the results for Perdue's Senate seat and a state Public Service Commission seat held by Lauren "Bubba" McDonald. The AP called a runoff in Perdue's race and hasn't made a call yet in McDonald's race, where the Republican leads but is short of reaching a majority of votes, as required by Georgia law.
 Additionally, Collins and Shafer asked Raffensperger to verify the validity of signatures on 1.4 million mailed-in ballots and confirm the ballots include the proper notations, check in-person and mail-in ballots to make sure no one cast one of each, check that no one who's not eligible was able to vote and trace the ballots' chain of custody to confirm that they were legally cast.
 There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.
 The issues Trump's campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: problems with signatures, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost. With Biden leading Trump by wide margins in key states, none of those issues would affect the election's outcome.
 Trump's campaign has also complained that their poll watchers were unable to scrutinize the voting process, including in Georgia's Fulton County. Many legal challenges based on those complaints have been tossed out by judges, some within hours of filing. None of the complaints show any evidence that the election's outcome was affected.
 Cathy Cox, dean of Mercer University law school and a former Georgia secretary of state, said the election law places the burden of proof on Trump and his allies to show evidence of vote fraud.
 "All I've heard is noise and innuendo, rumor and gossip," said Cox, a Democrat who served as Georgia's top elections official from 1999 until 2007. "Just throwing junk at the wall to see if somebody will buy it."

Heroes are important. Their acts inspire us and teach us about selflessness.                                  Heroes are an integral part of the American fabric and are woven into every American holiday — including every Nov. 11, Veterans Day. If they are from our community, they give us an even greater sense of pride, not only in mid-November, but throughout the year. Regretfully, the passing of time fades their stories and often relegates them to historical records left to collect dust on library shelves.                                  Therefore, I believe it is important for those who witness heroes’ acts to keep their story alive — so that the heroes of Veterans Day past and present are the heroes of Veterans Days future.                                  As a native Long Islander and someone who’s called some of the world’s largest cities home throughout my military career, I have chosen to call Charleston, West Virginia, my home for almost 25 years. By all standards, Charleston is small-town America, despite being West Virginia’s largest city with a population slightly under 50,000.                                  However, I am inextricably linked to a town that is only a tenth of the size of Charleston and a 900-mile drive to the northeast — Waldoboro, Maine.                                  Just shy of 30 years ago, on Jan. 26, 1991, one of Waldoboro’s own, John Blodgett, performed an act of heroism that affected the lives of many. On that evening, the Marine battalion that I led came under an Iraqi FROG (Free Rocket Over Ground) missile attack. Realizing that the battalion’s augmented civilian-host-nation-truck drivers were in an unprotected area outside the battalion perimeter, Staff Sgt. Blodgett, without regard for his own safety, ran 350 meters to direct them to a bunker. His immediate, selfless response and extreme presence of mind under fire was heroic.

                                                                                       The tabulation comes on the heels of an attempt by several members identifying themselves as members of the Spalding County and Georgia Republican Party gathered outside the elections office on the night of November 5th demanding that they be allowed to observe the counting of electoral ballots.                                                                                        The Spalding County Sheriff's Department was called after several Spalding County Election Board employees feared for their lives when individuals began to pound and hit on the doors and windows of the office. The interference occurred as county officials were verifying the eligibility of provisional ballots in preparation for the tabulation of provisional ballots scheduled to take place later this afternoon.                                                                                        Ms. Marcia Ridley, Spalding County Elections supervisor stated, "My staff was in the process of ensuring that the provisional ballots received from the county's 18 precincts on November 3rd were eligible. We are required to verify voter eligibility before the ballot can be opened or tabulated. The staff was working well into the night just as we always do during an election. The process of counting each legal ballot must follow the guidelines issued by the Georgia Secretary of State."                                                                                       "At approximately 5:30 pm a group of citizens arrived at the office demanding entry. The group of nearly 40 people included Spalding County Commissioner James Dutton, District 2. I made the decision to protect my staff and deny entry to the election's office. As Elections Supervisor, my job is to not only secure and count every legal ballot, but to ensure that my staff is out of harms way. The Spalding County Elections Board is non -partisan and our mission is to ensure Democracy is preserved."                                                                                        The incident occurred as thousands of poll workers across the country go through the process of verifying that only registered voters can cast a ballot. The Spalding County Board of Elections is committed to ensuring that every legally registered voter who cast a ballot in the November 3rd election will have their vote counted.                                                                                        If the registrars determine after the polls close, but not later than three days following the primary or election, that the person casting the provisional ballot timely registered to vote and was eligible and entitled to vote in such primary or election, the registrars shall notify the election superintendent and the provisional ballot shall be counted and included the county's or municipality's certified election results.

The Mineral Wells city council and TIRZ board approved an expansion of the TIRZ area by 615 acres in October. Cities can create a TIRZ where conditions exist that substantially impair an area’s growth and where development and redevelopment is not likely to occur but for public infrastructure enhancements financed by a TIRZ. TIRZ No. 2 was created by the Mineral Wells city council in August of 2008.                                  “We’ve recently expanded the TIRZ and the other taxing entities, we’re going to be asking them to participate in that, but we believe that y’all can’t participate in that extension of the boundaries of the TIRZ,” Criswell said. “We’re asking you to adopt a resolution to extend the original TIRZ and your participation in the original TIRZ for a little bit longer because we think we’re about to see some really amazing things down there and we would certainly like continue the partnership.”                                  The participation agreement originally had an end date of 2039 but will be expanded to 2044 with the new resolution.                                  “In the MOU that was signed last year between the city and The Baker group, we agreed to extend it 10 years,” Hawes said. “I looked at the numbers and didn’t know if 10 years was going to be enough because they were slowly getting started. They’re really getting it done, but to be on the safe side we extended it 15 years — better safe than sorry because you can always cut off your participation early.”

COVID-19 A NEW PRE-EXISTING CONDITION                                  Before the ACA, insurers could turn a person down for an individual policy, or charge them more, based on their medical history. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that about 54 million working-age adults have health issues that would have made them "uninsurable" before former President Barack Obama's signature law.                                  Tens of millions more have issues that could have led to higher premiums. Female gender was one, as insurers routinely charged women more.                                  COVID-19 would become America's newest pre-existing condition, for more than 10 million people who have tested positive so far.                                  Under the ACA, a coronavirus case cannot be used to deny someone coverage or charge them more. If Obamacare is gone, that becomes a real question.                                  Trump promised to always protect people with preexisting conditions, but never said how he'd do it.                                  COVERAGE FOR MORE THAN 20 MILLION                                  The ACA's two main programs for covering uninsured people would be wiped out if the law is overturned, leaving more than 20 million people uninsured unless a divided Congress can put a new safety net in place.                                  About 12 million low-income people are covered through the health law's Medicaid expansion, now available in most states. Most of them are adults working in jobs that don't pay all that much, and don't come with health insurance. Some have lost jobs in businesses like hotels, restaurants, and movie theaters, which continue to struggle because of the pandemic.                                  Another group, more than 11 million people, has private coverage purchased through taxpayer-subsidized private markets such as HealthCare.gov                                  That's also in jeopardy.                                  PREVENTION                                  Most American women now pay nothing out of their own pockets for birth control. That's covered as a preventive service, free of charge to the patient, under the ACA.                                  Many other services, from colonoscopies to flu shots, are also free.                                  If people again face copays for routine preventive care, that may discourage some to go for tests shown to detect diseases like cancer at early stages when they are easier to treat.

Both Newton and Vaughn are fun to watch, essentially playing dual roles. As Millie, Newton is timid and dorky, relying a lot on the support of her fellow outcasts Nyla (Celeste O’Connor) and Josh (Misha Osherovich). As the Butcher, she changes her whole look and attitude, dressing more fashionably and taunting the boys and girls who’ve made Millie’s life a living hell.                                  The big comic gimmick here is the physical presence of the beefy Vaughn, who for long stretches of “Freaky” gets to pretend he’s a teenage girl. To the actor’s credit, he doesn’t overplay it. He mainly makes Millie into someone very aware of her feelings — whether she’s taking giddy delight in urinating as a man or taking advantage of being incognito to have a heart-to-heart conversation with her mother.

Biden's election victory makes another shot of stimulus spending more likely, though probably not until after his inauguration in January. A package of $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion would add as much as 4.5% to growth next year, according to Capital Economics. That would be enough to return the economy to its pre-pandemic level by the end of 2021. Most economists note that the economy's painfully sluggish recovery from the 2008-2009 Great Recession was due in large part to government spending limits that took effect in 2010.                                                                      "The most important economic issue today, tomorrow and into the next several years is fiscal policy," said Eric Winograd, U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, referring to the government's tax and spending policies. "With monetary policy (by the Fed) largely bled dry, fiscal policy is the only game in town."                                                                      Unlike Trump, Biden regards big increases in spending on social, education and development programs as critical to longer-term growth. The president-elect has proposed nearly $5.4 trillion in new spending over the next decade, according to the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model. That includes $1.9 trillion on education and $1.6 trillion on new infrastructure -- roads, bridges, highways and other public structures -- and research and development.                                                                      The president-elect has also said he would raise $3.4 trillion in additional tax revenue over a decade to help pay for it, Penn Wharton found. He has proposed raising the corporate income-tax to 28% from 21%, reversing half of Trump's cut from 35% in 2017. Biden would also raise income and payroll taxes for people making $400,000 a year or more -- about 2% of the population.                                                                      Yet Biden may be the first president since George H.W. Bush not to have both the House and Senate controlled by his party during at least his first two years in office. Whether that becomes true will depend on the outcome of two Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January. But most observers expect Biden to face a GOP Senate, which would likely block much of his agenda. Republican senators would fight Biden's tax increases and at least limit the size of a new economic stimulus package.                                                                     "The outcome of the Senate race, arguably, is the most important consideration as far as likely tax legislation is concerned," said Robert Willens, a professor of finance at Columbia University.                                                                      Biden's spending proposals include $2 trillion over four years to counter climate change, a reversal from Trump's focus on supporting oil and gas drilling. He wants to spend money to retrofit homes and buildings to make them more energy efficient and building out an infrastructure for electric vehicles.                                                                      In many areas, Biden can operate through executive orders or regulation. He could also reverse much of the administration's approach to legal immigration, which has cut the annual number of new arrivals to to about 600,000 from 1 million. Most economists say the effects of Biden's policies would be negligible in the short run but would expand the nation's long-run economic output by accelerating population growth.                                                                     Biden also plans to rejoin the Paris Agreement on behalf of the nation and has said he will sign executive orders to fight climate change. He aims to stop climate-damaging emissions from power plants by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions in the economy overall no later than 2050.                                                                      The president-elect could also reverse some of Trump's executive orders by imposing tougher fuel economy standards, compelling coal plants to reduce emissions or restoring requirements that strengthen the oil and gas industry's reporting and reduction of toxic chemicals.                                                                     On trade, Biden will jettison Trump's go-it-alone style in confronting China. Instead, the president-elect says he will seek to build alliances with Europe and Japan to confront China's government subsidies, intellectual property rights violations and market restrictions, among other trade concerns.                                                                      To maintain those alliances, Biden is all but certain to drop his predecessor's inclination to target America's allies by threatening tariffs on car imports from Europe, or imposing tariffs on steel imports from Canada and Mexico. Still, Democrats in Congress are suspicious of China, and trade tensions will likely persist.                                                                      Trump has sought to ban Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat and has taken steps to root out Huawei from the small space it occupies in U.S. telecom networks. He has done so while pressuring other countries not to use Huawei in their next-generation 5G networks.                                                                      Though Republican and Democrats are both suspicious of Huawei, TikTok could get a reprieve under Biden. Robert Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which is funded by U.S. tech companies, said the TikTok ban was "much more of a Trump issue" that Biden might drop.                                                                      The president-elect could continue the government's rising efforts to curb the outsize power of the tech industry. The Trump administration launched what could be a landmark antitrust case against Google that will likely continue.                                                                      And, like the Trump administration, Biden has also taken aim at Section 230, a law that is foundational to the modern internet and gives tech firms liability protection from lawsuits for what users post. The president-elect has said it should be revoked. Trump and other Republicans have baselessly asserted that the social media companies were censoring conservatives. Democrats criticize the law because they think social-media companies are failing to suppress misinformation and hate speech.                                                                      Atkinson said he also sees relations between the White House and business returning to a more normal, predictable state under Biden, after Trump's willingness to loudly condemn companies that criticized him.                                                                      "If they would ever pressure a company, it would be very quiet," Atkinson said. "Biden is not going to use the bully pulpit to name and shame American companies."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — CNN and Fox News Channel battled for viewers on the election day that turned into an election week and then some, each earning bragging rights.
 CNN edged Fox among total viewers for the week, averaging 5.9 million viewers to Fox's 5.7 million. The latter was dominant on Tuesday as President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden faced off at the polls.
 Fox averaged 14.1 million viewers Tuesday to CNN's 9.4 million, with MSNBC drawing 7.6 million, according to Nielsen figures. But CNN was tops among those watching Biden’s Saturday evening speech after the race was called in his favor, with 13.5 million tuning in.
 MSNBC's coverage drew 9 million viewers, while Fox's viewership for the speech was not included on Nielsen's list of the top 40 cable shows.
 For the week, MSNBC averaged 4.6 million viewers.
 Cable channels were the preferred option for those following the election, as the broadcast networks lagged behind individually and cumulatively. Their Tuesday viewership was ABC, 6.3 million; NBC, 5.8 million; CBS, 4.5 million.
 Viewers also kept an eye on football and the pandemic-delayed season premieres of returning shows, including CBS' “Young Sheldon” and “NCIS: Los Angeles," each drawing 6 million-plus viewers.

Trump has been criticized for what some saw as a too-close relationship with Putin, with critics accusing him of failing to forcefully push back on Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump also came under fire for appearing to side with Putin and against the findings of the American intelligence community, with the Russian leader denying that his country meddled in the race.

 La Russa is 2,728-2,365 with six pennants over 33 seasons with the White Sox, Oakland and St. Louis. He was enshrined in Cooperstown in 2014.
 Only Hall of Famers Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763) have more victories. La Russa and Sparky Anderson are the only managers to win the World Series in the American League and National League.
 La Russa pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in Florida in 2007 after police found him asleep inside his running sport utility vehicle at a stop light and smelling of alcohol.
 “I accept full responsibility for my conduct, and assure everyone that I have learned a very valuable lesson and that this will never occur again,” La Russa said then.

Can this whirlwind romance and engagement really go the distance? Fans have been stunned by how wild this ride was for Clare and Dale, and they'll certainly be curious to see what goes down over the months ahead.

Serpas, however, describes her Hammer and Huntington installations as “potential” works of art. Stuck in Switzerland as “Made in L.A.” approached, she had to let others do the scavenging and composing for her.                                  The two halves of the show feel very different, too, even though all 30 artists have work in both venues. Devoid of people, the Hammer’s conventional, white-cube galleries seem rather airless and aloof. The Huntington feels more fully engaged, perhaps because the lavish gardens (though not the museum or library) are open, and masked visitors are out and about.                                  Also,  some artists are shown in dialogue with other Huntington specialties, which adds a conversational liveliness.                                  Monica Majoli’s ethereal, erotic watercolors based on the defunct men’s lifestyle magazine Blueboy — think gay Playboy, especially popular in the 1970s and ’80s, just before the AIDS pandemic — resonates with the stunning 18th century Thomas Gainsborough painting of that name that is the international superstar in the museum’s collection. A displayed archive like Mario Ayala’s underground Chicano magazines — source material for skilled airbrush paintings that evoke vernacular altarpieces — is thrown into high relief in the vicinity of a heavily Anglo-American library in a town with Indigenous roots in Mexico.

The thought of piloting this boat-sized droptop around Japan's narrow streets is mind-boggling. It's not particularly wide, but it has the turning circle of the Space Battleship Yamamoto. Not to mention, being a Mustang underneath, the steering wheel is on the wrong side for Japan. (Later examples of the Le Seyde are based on the Nissan Sylvia, and yes, someone has built a drift car out of one.)                                  This one was imported into British Columbia by JDM Import, a small specialist firm that sources a mix of Japanese camper vans, kei cars, and Japanese-market Minis. Owner Ivan Umin says he keeps an eye out for anything interesting coming through the auctions, and commutes in a lowered Nissan Elgrand van. Even so, the Le Seyde easily overshadows the Delicas and Daihatsus it's parked next to.                                  And, where companies like Zimmer and Excalibur are now mere footnotes of audacity crushed beneath the pragmatic wheels of the rest of the auto industry, Mitsuoka can point to more than fifty years of continuous operation. It's the Studio Ghibli of car companies, producing oddball artistry that's filled with a surprising amount of heart.                                  As with Honda and Toyota, there was an actual Mr. Mitsuoka. Susumu Mitsuoka founded the company that still bears his name in 1968, in Toyama, a couple hundred miles northwest of Tokyo. At first, the company was little more than a specialist repair shop, with a particular focus on foreign makes. The company's logo is a stylized copy of the diagram for a simple third-century horse-drawn cart.                                   In the late Sixties and early Seventies, Japan was beginning to emerge as an automotive manufacturing power, but European marques were still popular. Mitsuoka was himself a confessed British car nut, and echoes of that appreciation can be found in the Viewt, basically a Nissan Micra with the face of a classic Jaguar Mk 2.                                  At some point, a customer brought in an Italian microcar of indeterminate make for repair. Parts couldn't be found, but rather than simply moving on, Susumu Mitsuoka was spurred to build his own car from scratch.

“It won’t be as ambitious, no two ways about it,” Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, told NPR. A Democrat-controlled Congress would be extremely handy in making Biden’s dream of a carbon-neutral U.S. by 2050 come true. However, two Senate runoff races in Georgia will determine the balance of Congress, and they don’t happen until January.

“I think they’re loathe to, come right out and say, ‘Oh, we’re just canceling.’ Because nobody wants to be the bad guy,” he said. “Nobody wants to right now. They’re letting the organizations make these decisions.”                                  For now, the Mobile Civic Center is continuing to book balls for Mardi Gras organizations.                                  Kendall Wall, who manages the Mobile Civic Center and the Convention Center, said his staff is working hard to help organizations plan balls under new social distancing rules. But he added the capacity opts out at about 2,600 people.                                  “Capacity’s the No. 1 thing. … That’s the greatest challenge everybody’s got, ’cause these guys are used to having, you know, 4,000 or 5,000 or 6,000 to the event, itself,” he said. “So that’s really the big challenge right now.”                                  Losing the balls and the parades would be a disappointment and an economic blow to a city that relies on the visitors and the money spend through Carnival season. But Joynt noted it would not be unprecedented. World War II forced the cancelation of Mardi Gras.                                  And Joynt added that putting off parades for a year can’t kill Mardi Gras entirely. He’s said Mobilians would just have to get more creative. By way of analogy, be points to a Dr. Seuss story.                                  “They can’t cancel Mardi Gras,” he said. “You can cancel a parade. You can cancel a ball. You can’t cancel Mardi Gras. The Grinch never stole Christmas. The Grinch stole Christmas trees and presents. But the Whos down in Whoville still had Christmas. That’s the lesson, right?”

There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia. However, regardless of whether the presidential race is audited, Trump could likely request an optional recount. State law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden's lead stood at 0.25 percentage points as of Tuesday afternoon.                                                                      Collins and Shafer also requested that election officials recanvass the results for Perdue's Senate seat and a state Public Service Commission seat held by Lauren "Bubba" McDonald. The AP called a runoff in Perdue's race and hasn't made a call yet in McDonald's race, where the Republican leads but is short of reaching a majority of votes, as required by Georgia law.                                                                     Additionally, Collins and Shafer asked Raffensperger to verify the validity of signatures on 1.4 million mailed-in ballots and confirm the ballots include the proper notations, check in-person and mail-in ballots to make sure no one cast one of each, check that no one who's not eligible was able to vote and trace the ballots' chain of custody to confirm that they were legally cast.                                                                      There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.                                                                     The issues Trump's campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: problems with signatures, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost. With Biden leading Trump by wide margins in key states, none of those issues would affect the election's outcome.                                                                     Trump's campaign has also complained that their poll watchers were unable to scrutinize the voting process, including in Georgia's Fulton County. Many legal challenges based on those complaints have been tossed out by judges, some within hours of filing. None of the complaints show any evidence that the election's outcome was affected.                                                                     Cathy Cox, dean of Mercer University law school and a former Georgia secretary of state, said the election law places the burden of proof on Trump and his allies to show evidence of vote fraud.                                                                     "All I've heard is noise and innuendo, rumor and gossip," said Cox, a Democrat who served as Georgia's top elections official from 1999 until 2007. "Just throwing junk at the wall to see if somebody will buy it."

Dr. Paul Young, age 82, of Buena Vista, Oregon died in his sleep on Monday, October 12, 2020.                                  On the crest of a hill near Paul’s home of fifty-two years, the limbs of an ancient oak tree reached out across grasses and wildflowers. Nearby several other large oaks grow in a loosely configured line that runs north to south. Paul had a theory about these trees and their position on the farm to which he and his youthful family had moved in 1968. He imagined that the oaks had been left to grow on either side of a long-abandoned wagon trail that had wound its way over the hill and past the farm’s original homestead. Paul liked to walk this imagined trail, stopping to pick up fallen limbs for winter fires, concocting ways of securing gates to fencing posts, planning irrigation lines, which field to cut, what battery to jump-start, and daydreaming about additions to his herd of cattle, and breeds of English sheep he might inquire about. Paul would walk the hill, study the horizon and watch his children grow, his grandchildren arrive, and the yearly migration of geese overhead. Mid-thought his pager would often interrupt and alert him. Over a period of thirty-six years, the pager would sound, calling his attention to the needs of the patients and staff he worked with in his role as a physician and - not a few times when at work - a pager that would alert him that he had a message telling him that his cows were running free and grazing the grasses along Buena Vista Road.                                  Paul, sitting in a doctor’s lounge wearing a medical coat paired with cowboy boots and reading a biography of Thomas Jefferson or heading to a barn near midnight in a wool jacket, muddy Wellies, and carrying a flashlight and a newly sterilized lambing rope, lived a multifaceted life. He was fascinated with the elements of farming culture, animal husbandry, the discoveries of science, recent medical advances, and the potential of travel. The simple and practical lifestyles of colonial Americans called to his spirit and his never-ending acquisition of biographies and historical accounts led to his collection of nearly one thousand books.

The only real chance is for a mid-level team that feels like they are a QB upgrade away from competing for multiple playoff wins to take a shine to Stafford. That would be the Colts if Rivers retires, Steelers if Roethlisberger retires, Patriots (maybe), Browns (maybe) or 49ers (who would have to send Garoppolo away to make it work). The Giants and Cowboys probably merit mention, though at this point I don't buy either of them having interest. The Bears and Vikings might also fit but trading viable starting QBs within a division is akin to divorcing a spouse only to have them marry your more successful sibling a week later.

The race for president in Georgia is too close to call. As of Tuesday, Biden led Trump by 12,651 votes out of nearly 5 million votes counted. Nearly all ballots have been counted, though counties have until Friday to certify their results.
 Georgia law outlines several steps that must be completed before results are official.
 First, Raffensperger must decide whether to conduct an audit of the race. Under Georgia law, Raffensperger must select one Georgia race to audit and provide statistical evidence on whether the vote count was accurate. The audit will include hand-counting a random sample of ballots to check for accuracy. If he chooses the race for president, the margin is so tight that an audit would effectively require a statewide hand count of every ballot cast, Raffensperger said Tuesday.
 Raffensperger is expected to announce on Wednesday which race will be audited.
 There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia. However, regardless of whether the presidential race is audited, Trump could likely request an optional recount. State law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden’s lead stood at 0.25 percentage points as of Tuesday afternoon.
