The world of wealth- and investment-technology can be a wonky, crowded space, full of entrants trying to find new solutions for old financial problems, clamoring for advisers', clients', and big firms' attention.
 Like other corners of the fintech market, wealth-tech startups have reported fresh infusions of capital this year even as the coronavirus pandemic has threatened financial stability around the world.
 Last quarter, wealth-tech startups raised $1.2 billion in venture funding, up from $450 million during the first quarter, according to a report from CB Insights. Total deal activity ticked up slightly from quarter to quarter, from 28 to 32 deals.
 Business Insider asked investors to nominate early-stage startups in the wealth management ecosystem that they see as up-and-comers. We set a criteria that companies eligible for this list could be in and outside of investors' portfolios, while sticking with startups that have not raised beyond a Series B round of funding.
 Startups they selected in and around wealth management run the gamut. Two are in the business of will-writing and end-of-life planning -- one US-based, and one London-based. One has been dubbed a "German Robinhood."
 Another, the most-nominated startup on this list, builds technology for financial advisers with the use of artificial intelligence, and has cracked into the fast-growing independent wealth management industry.
 Here are the 10 startups investors nominated as wealth-tech companies on the rise.

“It was complicated the first year,” Hanson said. “The second year I started, and I caught the hang of it because I was in every practice rep. (Coach) calls the play and I know where exactly I am going. I just like to have the ball. That way, if something goes wrong, it's on me. Being a senior this year, I’d rather have the game on me than on a freshman.”
 The Bulldogs are a study in extremes. They are heavy in both seniors and freshman, a team fighting for success in the present, while keeping an eye on its future. Quarterback Bennett Berger, a junior, will be a big part of that future. He returns to his role as the starting quarterback this season after missing much of last year to a broken ankle.

Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. ScanSource has $1.69 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.13. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.

Novak Djokovic has hit out at the lack of communication over the way the serve clock is being used at the US Open.
 The world number one eased past Damir Dzumhur in his first-round match on Monday, winning 6-1 6-4 6-1 in just under two hours.
 Djokovic seemed perturbed in the second set, bellowing towards his box in the empty stands and later questioning chair umpire Damien Dumusois about why the serve clock is being implemented differently at Flushing Meadows compared to last week's Western & Southern Open.
 The Serbian feels it was not made clear enough that umpires would begin the countdown much sooner from this week.
 "Yes, that's the problem that I have. I was not aware of it. No one really brought it to my attention," he said.
 "The lack of communication is something that worries me once again. I mean, that's something that really upset me. I don't mind if someone communicates and maybe asks the opinion of us players because we're the ones who are supposed to play. But it's going to greatly affect the match.
 "We've played in the certain tempo, so to say, [we] got used to it during the Western & Southern tournament, which just ended two days ago. Two days later we have a different rule that was just not communicated to us. That's something that I found just not acceptable, not fair. But I guess I have to deal with it, and that's it.
 "I just think there should be a better job done in communication with players prior to changing things like this."
 For Djokovic, Monday's match behind closed doors was a peculiar experience, with fans - including his family - shown on courtside big screens while watching remotely.
 "We're all trying to get used to these kind of circumstances, having big LED screens on the side, kind of behind the court," he said. "Obviously, seeing the rest of my team and my family and my friends on the screen was a delight. Truly, it was really, really nice. It brought a smile to my face, kind of motivated me to keep on playing well.
 "I was speaking with the USTA people. They still did not clarify and determine when are they going to switch on the screens, whether it's going to be after points, games, sets. They are kind of testing it out.
 "I think it was fine. It was not bothering us players obviously serving or playing. I think most importantly not during play. It was fine. It was not hindering the play. At least you get a sense that they are with you virtually."
 Djokovic, who is the heavy favourite to win a fourth US Open title this month and has won all 24 of his matches in 2020, faces Kyle Edmund in round two.
 Edmund has won only once in six meetings with Djokovic, at the Madrid Masters two years ago, and was beaten in straight sets in the last 16 at Flushing Meadows in 2016.
 "He does have a really good serve and forehand, two really big weapons," Djokovic said. "I had some really good matches against him in the past, Wimbledon, tough four-setter a few years ago. He doesn't feel so much pressure I think playing on the big court. He actually likes the challenge. I have a lot of respect for him. He's a really hard worker, puts a lot of hours on and off the court into perfecting his game.
 "His results were kind of up and down a little bit, but I think he does have the game and the potential to be in the top 20 without a doubt, where I expect him to be soon. So it's going to be a tough one.
 "Do I want to keep the [winning] streak going? Of course I do. Am I thinking about it as a priority number one every single day? No. It's there, and of course, it's an additional motivation for me. It actually fuels me to play even stronger, play even better, I think, bring the right intensity every match.''

The Daily News verifies and reviews all letters to the editor we receive. The letters represent the views of the letter writers, not those of the Daily News.
 Regarding my letter [Aug. 11 Daily News] about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and how our Idiot-In-Chief Donald Trump has awakened to a way to stop funding these programs by massive payroll tax cut, people should read between the lines.
 Ever since he stole the White House he has been looking for ways to abolish or cripple these much needed programs. Congressional members have fought over how to aid COVID-19 victims and Donald Trump not only rammed an executive order through regarding payroll taxes but is determined to destroy them altogether by making these tax cuts permanent if re-elected.
 Hopefully this does not happen. As a person on a fixed income, I need these benefits as much as anyone.
 What I am afraid of happening is this - Donald Trump will "Rig" the election of 2020.
 How?
 Simple - five minutes after 8 p.m. on election day, Tuesday, Nov. 3, the major networks will interrupt their election coverage for a late breaking update and shift to the White House. There a stern and angry looking President Donald Trump, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and the Secretary of State to and for the Office of The President, Mike Pompeo, will declare that due to voter fraud and irregularities he is calling for a halt to the election count and have HIS Secretary of State Pompeo speak.
 Then Pompeo will clearly declare the United States elections of Nov. 3, 2020, to be null and void and all ballots submitted destroyed.
 He will then announce that absentee mail-in voting and votes cast at polling booths be discounted and a new election in all states, possessions and territories reconvene one week from Nov. 3, on Nov. 10, by walk-in poll balloting only and any and all mailed in ballots be permanently disqualified excepting the proud Red State of Florida where Donald Trump can mail his in and have it counted as he proudly embraces the flag.
 Question being will it be the Stars and Stripes or Stars and Bars, a symbol of slavery and (voter) suppression.
 That is what I meant when I stated Idiot-In-Chief had awoken to the realization that he, and he alone, has the power by executive order to destroy "entitlement" programs Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid American taxpayers have submitted via payroll tax, their contributions and hard-earned dollars to support the elderly, and disabled to live by whatever means necessary.

In Turkey, for example, as many as 48 percent of businesses indicated that remaining resources would only be able to sustain them for three months, according to a UNDP report. In the western Balkans, a World Bank study shows more than 50 percent of small and medium businesses had to close operations, while those that remained open saw activities plunge. Partnership with the private sector is therefore seen as a critical component to a transformational socio-economic recovery.

Miriam Rivera hadn't entertained the idea of becoming a lawyer until the sixth grade, when her teacher told her she should go to law school.
 To Rivera, whose mother grew up on a subsistence farm in Puerto Rico and grew coffee beans, the prospect of even going to college -- let alone grad school -- was something that hadn't been in the picture.
 "It was a real boost at a time when I grew up in an environment where I was more likely to be told that I'd be 16, pregnant, and on food stamps, than to be told I should go to law school," said Rivera, who grew up in Chicago in a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood, where gangs, drugs, and prostitution were embedded into daily life.
 Now, Rivera is the managing partner of Ulu Ventures, an early seed-stage venture fund that she co-founded in 2008. Its portfolio includes companies like data startup Palantir, legal tech company Ravel Law, and fintech SoFi.
 The VC investor ended up getting not just a law degree, but one in business, too. After completing her undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rivera wrangled 50 students and law practitioners for informational chats, and learned that both law and business were key facets of any job.
 Her dual degree enabled her to be versatile in her career path. Upon graduating from Stanford University with her JD-MBA in 1995, Rivera followed a string of jobs as an associate at a law firm, a strategy consultant at Accenture, and in-house counsel at a couple of startups -- one of which she co-founded.
 "I always say, 'don't do this at home,'" she said of her career jumps during what she described as the "Silicon Valley boom."
 "It would've been risky if it hadn't been for the time that I was living in, where there were so many opportunities in Silicon Valley where I could switch positions quickly."
