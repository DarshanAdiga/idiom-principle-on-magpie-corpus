Detmold (dpa/lnw) - Nach einer versuchten schweren Brandstiftung in einer Psychiatrie in Detmold hat das dortige Landgericht die mutmaßlichen Brandstifter am Donnerstag auf freien Fuß gesetzt. Ein Gutachter hatte die beiden Männer für schuldunfähig erklärt. Zum Zeitpunkt der Tat im September 2019 hatten der 40- und der 31-Jährige demnach psychotische Schübe. In ihren Wahnvorstellungen wollten sie sich von der Feuerwehr aus ihrer Station in der Psychiatrie befreien lassen. Deshalb hatten sie versucht, unter einem Feuermelder Papier und Kleidungsstücke anzünden.

Despite round the clock customs clearance for three months, non-essential shipments have clogged the ports and airports with customs agents or brokers not turning up due to unavailability of logistics partners and transportation. In fact, in many cases, duties are not being paid with importers citing lack of requirement due to temporary closure of manufacturing facilities.

"All you have to do to get your free Steam copy of _Fallout 76_ is go here and link your Steam account to your Bethesda.net account before 11:59pm ET, April 12," Bethesda said. "When the Steam version is available, you will automatically receive your _Fallout 76_ entitlement."
 This offer is a change of thinking from what Bethesda originally said about the Steam version. In an FAQ shared in February, Bethesda said people who own the game on Bethesda.net wouldn't get access to the Steam version for free. The FAQ also said Atoms and Fallout 1st memberships wouldn't be transferable, though that part still remains true.

 If you haven't bought _Fallout 76_ through Bethesda.net at all, Bethesda has another offer for you. For those who haven't bought the game on the PC before, buying the Steam version will include the _Fallout Classic Collection_ as a bonus. That bundle consists of _Fallout 1, Fallout 2,_ and _Fallout Tactics_ with the bundle being distributed during the two-week window after the game's Steam launch.
  _Fallout 76_ releases on Steam on April 14th.

The future has never been more uncertain for Scottish Premiership footballers, particularly those whose contracts are due to expire at the start of June, as Cooke’s does.
 He hopes he can say goodbye to St Mirren fans the right way after they stuck by him through thick and thin, should his future be away from the club.
 He added: “Everyone is in the dark as to when we’ll get back.
 “When you’ve got a pre-season, a winter break or you’re coming back from injury, you have targets to hit, which makes it so much more straightforward.
 “But, with this virus, there is no set target.
 “It’s so hard not having a date to aim for and there’s not a lot of information filtered to the players and staff because it’s all so uncertain.
 “It comes down to a lot of big decisions for the SFA, the SPFL and UEFA.

Cooke’s winning hat-trick against Dundee just before the play-offs ensured the Saints went into their two crunch ties with the Terrors on a massive high.
 The former Truro FC player still believes he can play a big part for the Paisley side in the future, as long as he gets the backing of the manager.
 He said: “I’ve always believed that a lot of football revolves around confidence – both what you have in yourself and that your manager passes on to you.
 “If you get a good run of games together, then you can really grow into your position.
 “Sometimes, it might take three or four games, but, once you’re up to speed, you can really kick on from there.
 “Although, with the injuries I’ve had and the big number of strikers we’ve had since the winter break, it’s just not been the best time for me, personally.
 “I’m a positive person though and I’ll just keep working my hardest to get back into the team, as always.”
