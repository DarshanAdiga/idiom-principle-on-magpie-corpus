During a health crisis, the FDA can loosen its normal scientific standards to allow emergency use of experimental drugs, devices, vaccines and other medical products. The first vaccines to get the provisional green light in the U.S. are almost certain to be made available under this process, known as emergency use authorization.
 Instead of the usual requirement of “substantial evidence” of safety and effectiveness for approval, the FDA can allow products onto the market as long as their benefits are likely to outweigh their risks. It has already used its emergency powers to authorize hundreds of coronavirus tests and a handful of treatments during the pandemic.
 But the agency has almost no experience granting emergency use for vaccines and has laid out extra standards it will use to make decisions on upcoming COVID-19 shots.
 In October, FDA officials told vaccine makers they should have two months of safety follow-up from half of the people enrolled in their studies before requesting emergency authorization. That data is expected to be enough for FDA to allow vaccinations of certain high-risk groups, such as front-line health workers and nursing home residents.
 Full approval of a vaccine will likely require six months of safety follow-up as well as extensive inspections of company manufacturing sites. The leading vaccine makers are not expected to complete that process until next spring or summer. Only then is the FDA expected to grant full approval, which would allow vaccinations of the general population.

Simplistic thinking occurs when tensions are high. Rational thinking becomes difficult and conflict can be the result of avoiding ongoing problems. Congress would benefit in reaching decisions during this crisis by avoiding simplistic thinking and shifting perceptions. To save Americans from all unforeseen effects of COVID-19, Congress must think outside the box to get creative to reach a consensus on what bills should be passed to help the people of the United States regardless of race, gender or class.


  Once Congress works together to avoid social traps and simplistic thinking, it will be on the path to reaching its superordinate goal and aiding Americans during this difficult time. COVID-19 is not going away any time soon and we need Congress to figure out a way to help all Americans; not just some.

PETOSKEY — As COVID-19 cases reach new highs in the region and state, Emmet County board of commissioners chairman Bill Shorter reiterated past statements urging people to take full caution to prevent the spread of the virus.


  Speaking near the end of the board's meeting Thursday, which was conducted over Zoom, Shorter reflected on reports of the rapidly rising cases in Emmet County, and offered "heartfelt condolences" to those with family members or loved ones who have died from the virus. The statements come as the state enters into a three-week crackdown on transmission-preventative measures.


  "As of 4 o'clock this afternoon, we have 764 positive cases in Emmet County," he said Thursday. "Our four-county area has been accelerating fast, but we seem to be accelerating faster than that."

Lindsey Catarino is the talk of her neighborhood. She put up her Christmas tree, lights and all, in mid-September. By Oct. 1, her mantel was decorated. Since, she has added more trees and decorations in just about every room of her Connecticut condo.


  The goal for the 42-year-old Catarino, like other newly minted early birds, is to bring on the warmth and comfort of Christmas by beating back “an otherwise insane world.”


  As some holiday tree sellers fear they'll sell out by Thanksgiving and parcel shipping companies worry about November gridlock, a growing number of people on a quest for joy have bucked tradition and gone full-on Christmas weeks earlier than they normally would.
