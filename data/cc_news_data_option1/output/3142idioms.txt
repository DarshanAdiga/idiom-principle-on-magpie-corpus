“For me, there aren’t really advantages to working remotely. It’s better to be face to face, or you lose the personal touch, the personal element of interaction with staff. Sometimes it’s difficult to get your point across, and difficult to know that the person grasps what you are trying to achieve. The advantage is I get to enjoy the lifestyle here, and I can still do a full day of work. One epiphany has been that working remotely has been easier than I thought it would be. We had staff working remotely throughout the covid lockdown—as many had—and it’s pleasing to see that it’s something that can continue afterward. The technology exists now for it to be really super- efficient. It’s improved so much in the last years: most information is cloud based, and video conferencing is of such good quality that you can do these things even over a relatively mediocre [transmission] line.”

Back in the days before the coronavirus pandemic, lots of people found community and comfort in singing together, whether at school, as a form of worship, in amateur groups or performing as professionals. Last year, Chorus America reported that some 54 million Americans — that is, more than 15% of the entire country's population — participated in some kind of organized group singing. And that study revealed that nearly three-quarters of those polled felt less lonely. Eighty percent said it made them "more optimistic, mindful and resilient."
 "The community is the most important thing we have," says Francisco J. Núñez, the founder and artistic director of the Young People's Chorus of New York City (YPC), which includes some 2,000 kids aged 7 to 18 from across the city. And he's even more aware of what his students have lost in the pandemic.
 After the shutdown in New York in mid-March, the YPC ensembles started meeting by Zoom just to talk. "Just seeing each other online that helped us socially, emotionally," Núñez says.
 But that same month, singers and choral directors across the country became concerned after a chorus in Washington state made national headlines. Sixty singers in the Skagit Valley Chorale showed up to a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal. Fifty-three of them became sick with the coronavirus, and two people died.

The first, is that for now, China does not escalate against US tech companies. It avoids an outright diplomatic confrontation with the US, ducks a further hit to its economy and bides its time until the result of the November election is clear. In the meantime, it uses the cover of US sanctions to tighten its grip on Hong Kong and potentially prepares punitive measures against political figures and business people in Taiwan. Under this scenario, US tech is for the time being unscathed, though Hong Kong related assets, especially banks and property should underperform.
