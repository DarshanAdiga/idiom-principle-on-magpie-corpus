In the story of the aged god of war, there is not only one little detail that was central to GoW 2 and 3 - terry idiocy. For all their budget, fiction, and the efforts of designers who deservedly bathed in the praise of the press, GoW are absurdly stupid, unpretentious slashers. But I say this without a trace of contempt.On the contrary, this is a meaningful, well-developed design philosophy: to ride a player on a roller coaster made in Hellenistic scenery and with as many dead loops as possible.

Since the game abandoned the fixed camera, you cannot see the entire battlefield.By primitive rapid pressing of buttons no one can beat anyone else. The leviathan, unlike the blades of Chaos, does not have a prohibitive radius of destruction, so disconnecting the brain and hammering on the gamepad, staring into the void, will not work. An enemy that is many times superior to you in number must be controlled.

A year ago, in my preview, I hastened to compare God of War with The Last of Us. In fact, it is more appropriate to put the game on a par with Resident Evil 4. It's not about the zombie collective farmers and Spanish dwarfs - it's about the changed gameplay formula. This is not just a continuation in a new vein or a fresh start. This is generally another game in which familiar motives are constantly guessed.

After the throw, the ax must be returned manually - the boomerang effect is not automatic. This opens up the potential for many ligaments and makes Leviathan a tool rather than a weapon for slaughter. You can throw it on a large scale into a particularly nasty creature, turning it into a block of ice. While one enemy is immobilized, stun and tear in half the second. And then - to run away, in a jump, return Leviathan to the hand and chop on the ground, causing a large ice explosion. Beauty! True, sometimes you forget that the enchanted ax does not live its own life, and because of this you get stuck in stupid situations, but, as for me, this is a plus. More impressions.

Never was the out-of-control, or slipping by someone too fast.
