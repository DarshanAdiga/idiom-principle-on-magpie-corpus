Tourism chief Malcolm Bell described the incident as 'unforgivable'.
 The chief executive of Visit Cornwall told CornwallLive: "I don't like to see signs like the one we saw on the A30 yesterday. It is being offensive to a large group of people.
 "I find it unforgivable. It's accusing people before they even arrive."
 Meanwhile, in Dawlish, a man dressed as the Grim Reaper who was holding a "Welcome holidaymakers" sign greeted the incoming visitors yesterday afternoon, before two men challenged him and confiscated his sign.
 The incidents were not reflective of the general mood in the region, as Devon and Cornwall welcomed visitors back with open arms on day one of a major boost to the Westcountry's economy.

Of course, it wasn't quite that easy. The chances that both bulbs would have used the same GPIO pins to control the red, green, blue, and white LEDs were pretty slim. But after some testing and modifications to the code, he was able to fire them up. The other issue was a bit trickier, as it turned out the bulb's flash chip was too small to hold his firmware's web configuration pages. So he had to break out the hot air gun and replace the SPI flash chip with something a bit roomier. We suppose he could have just made smaller web pages… but where's the fun in that?
