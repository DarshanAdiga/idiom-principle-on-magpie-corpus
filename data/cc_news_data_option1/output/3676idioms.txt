The chronic lack of wraparound childcare and depleted nursery provision is all too often ignored in discussions about returning to the office. Every effort must be made to ensure workers dealing with these issues – who are disproportionately women – are fully supported.
 However, for many people a taste of a different working day, free from long commutes, jam-packed trains and getting ripped off on overpriced sandwiches and coffee, has come as a blessed relief. No-one wants to see baristas or shopworkers out of a job, but what a world we live in where the chance for a better work/life balance is deemed as self-centred.
 The suggestion that people are leading a cushy life at home will jar with many. As one Zoom call merges into another, with lunch snatched in between, millions of home workers feel their days are more intense than they ever were in the office when banter and tea-rounds broke up the day.
 Which is why it would be hasty to write the office’s obituary. At the start of September, Dettol came under fire on social media for its poster ad that attempted to celebrate office life by positioning colleagues as a “second family” – but while the execution was cringeworthy, the sentiment had merit.
 The serendipitous conversations that spark great ideas, the buzz, the companionship, especially in a creative sector such as adland where people and relationships are so important, are priceless. Face-to-face collaboration is also essential for staff to learn, train, network and more.
  _Campaign_ ’s online series, “Reimagining the office”, which shines a spotlight on how adland is plotting its return, has shown creative businesses at their problem-solving best, determined to not just survive but thrive in the changed circumstances and doing so with empathy.

Optimism over Covid-19 vaccine and gradual opening of the economy has resulted in improved business outlook and is helping Italian super sports car maker Lamborghini generate new orders in the Indian market, according to a top company official.
 With 'Unlock' gaining momentum in the country after the phase of lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Lamborghini India is finding that positive consumer sentiment is driving both its sales and aftersales services.
 "Business is moving good given the scenario. Yes, we have started delivering cars," Lamborghini India Head Sharad Agarwal told PTI.
 He further said, "there are new models which are coming in. We have a long waiting time (for the cars). People know that their cars are only going to arrive next year. That way business is positive and also in aftersales we are now getting good throughputs, which means that people have started using their cars."
 (Also read: Lamborghini reaches historical milestone with 10,000th Aventador model)
 Stating that orders have started coming in now, Agarwal said, "there is one thing which people are understanding that if they order the car now in September, it is going to come only in March-April next year because we have a waiting period of around 6-8 months."
 He said optimism surrounding the progress of Covid-19 vaccine is also turning people positive.
 "Given the kind of news that people are hearing that the Covid-19 vaccine will be out by the end of the year people are turning hopeful for next year. That is helping us to generate new orders in the market. In fact, I will say that our order inflow is pretty positive," Agarwal added.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is set to preside over the signing of historic diplomatic deals between Israel and two Gulf Arab nations that could herald a dramatic shift in Middle East power dynamics and give him a boost ahead of the November election.In a White House ceremony aimed at showcasing presidential statesmanship, Trump will host more than 700 guests Tuesday on the South Lawn to witness the sealing of the agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Trump and his allies hope the occasion will burnish Trump’s credentials as a peacemaker at the height of his reelection campaign.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Emirati and Bahraini foreign ministers are to ink the deals before the crowd, which will include representatives of supporting nations from the Washington-based diplomatic corps but few other dignitaries from overseas. Some congressional Democrats who have offered muted praise have been invited to attend.In addition to the individual bilateral agreements signed by Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, all three will sign a trilateral document, officials said. The agreements are dubbed the “Abraham Accords” after the patriarch of the world’s three major monotheistic religions. Trump is expected to sign as a witness.The agreements won’t end active wars but will rather formalize the normalization of the Jewish state’s already warming relations with the two countries. And, while not addressing the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they may pave the way for a broader Arab-Israeli rapprochement after decades of enmity, a pair of wars and only two previous peace deals.Skeptics, including many longtime Mideast observers, analysts, experts and former officials, have expressed doubts about the impact of the deals and lamented that they ignore the Palestinians, who have rejected them as a stab in the back by fellow Arabs. Yet even the harshest critics have allowed that they could usher in a seismic shift in the region should other Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, follow suit, with implications for Iran, Syria and Lebanon. Other Arab countries believed to be close to recognizing Israel include Oman, Sudan and Morocco.“These agreements are a huge accomplishment for the countries involved and have led to a tremendous sense of hope and optimism in the region,” said Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who led the negotiations. “Instead of focusing on past conflicts, people are now focused on creating a vibrant future filled with endless possibilities.”Tuesday’s ceremony follows months of intricate diplomacy headed by Kushner and Trump’s envoy for international negotiations, Avi Berkowitz, that first bore fruit Aug. 13 when the Israel-UAE deal was announced. That was followed by the first direct commercial flight between the countries, and then the Sept. 11 announcement of the Bahrain-Israel agreement.The specific contents of the individual documents to be signed Tuesday, however, were not known ahead of the ceremony. While officials said they would hew closely to the joint statements issued when the deals were first announced, it remained unclear if the agreements would require further action by the three governments or what binding obligations they would commit each to enforcing.A senior White House official said Monday that the documents had been completed and that the UAE-Israel agreement would be longer and more detailed than the Bahrain agreement because there had been more time to finalize it. Still, the lack of clarity even a day before the ceremony has raised some suspicions about the durability of the agreements.Even in Israel, where the accords have received widespread acclaim, there is concern that that they might result in U.S. sales of sophisticated weaponry to the UAE and Bahrain, thus potentially upsetting Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region. Meanwhile, a politically vulnerable Netanyahu is facing questions about appearing at such a large event just days after he announced a new nationwide lockdown to fight a surge in coronavirus cases that will impose severe restrictions on movement and gatherings. The White House is encouraging those attending Tuesday’s ceremony to wear masks.And while the UAE and Bahrain have a history of suppressing dissent and critical public opinion, there have been indications that the agreements are not nearly as popular or well-received as in Israel. For one, neither country is sending its head of state or government to sign the deals with Netanyahu. Bahrain’s largest Shiite-dominated opposition group, Al-Wefaq, which the government ordered dissolved in 2016 amid a yearslong crackdown on dissent, said there is widespread rejection in the country of normalization. Al-Wefaq said in a statement that it joins other Bahrainis who categorically reject the agreement to normalize ties with the “Zionist entity,” and criticized the government for crushing the public’s ability to express opinions “to obscure the extent of discontent” at normalization. In the UAE, there has been speculation that Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, widely seen as the country’s day-to-day leader and architect of the Emirati push to improve relations with Israel, is steering clear of the signing ceremony.Although Emirati protocol dictates that the foreign minister and not the crown prince of a specific emirate be dispatched to represent the country in lieu of the UAE’s president, who’s rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke more than six years ago, there’s speculation the crown prince is not attending the White House ceremony for political reasons. He may not want to be seen throwing too much of his support behind Trump weeks ahead of a U.S. presidential election in which the outcome is far from certain. While the pageantry of the White House signing ceremony offers Trump and Netanyahu a political triumph, Prince Mohammed faces neither reelection pressures nor protests at home. The Emiratis may also be wary of appearing too close to Netanyahu, who publicly stated in August his opposition to the sale of U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter jets to the UAE. While the UAE has said that Israel not moving ahead with plans to annex West Bank settlements is a cornerstone of the agreement, Netanyahu has insisted that annexation is only suspended and remains on the table. ___Associated Press writer Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Your faith that you can ferret out the unquestionable truth about an event the moment it is announced must be comforting and now you have positive proof that you were right all along because Alex Tiffin said that the BBC said that Germany said that there is "unequivocal proof" that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent because, well, because Germany said. That is what we can know with confidence. When a government report says what you want it to say you are cock-sure that it is correct.

We need many billions of doses before the pandemic is over, and the quicker we get it, the sooner we can bring it to an end.

Un pescatore di 77 anni residente in provincia di Mantova è morto dopo essere caduto nel lago di Garda dalla sua barca nei pressi della località Porto Fornaci di Peschiera del Garda (Verona). La barca sulla quale si trovava l'anziano, in compagnia di un coetaneo mantovano, per motivi ancora da chiarire ha iniziato ad imbarcare acqua molto rapidamente fino ad affondare.
 I due pescatori sono caduti nel lago, venendo soccorsi da un'altra imbarcazione che si trovava nelle vicinanze. Tuttavia il 77enne, nonostante i soccorsi immediati del personale medico arrivato dall'ospedale di Peschiera del Garda e dei sanitari del 118 intervenuti con l'eliambulanza, è morto annegato.
 L'altro anziano, rimasto illeso, ha riferito agli agenti della Polizia Nautica, intervenuta per gli accertamenti del caso, che l'amico, proprietario della barca, non sapeva nuotare e di non essere riuscito a tenerlo a galla. Il pubblico ministero di turno ha già disposto la restituzione della salma ai familiari. Sono in corso le operazioni di recupero dell'imbarcazione finita sul fondo del lago da parte dei sommozzatori dei Vigili del Fuoco.

The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is 6.70% and predicted to reach at 7.34% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out- come was -7.00% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 5.45% for the next five year.

A: This year, 134,000 cases have been resolved by the courts at all levels. There are orders, restrictions, judgments, and a lot of file works in the middle. The total budget of the court in 2018 and 2019 was around 98 million Birr. This year, 138 million Birr has been allocated, an increase of 40 percent over the previous years. Another factor is often the efficiency of the courts. In light of this, the courts are now making quick decisions. Although we have not reached the desired level, there are improvements. To tell you about the Supreme Court alone, more than 15,000 cases were decided by the Supreme Court in less than a year. There are cases that sometimes last up to 5 and 6 years. This is true. Currently, restrictions are being made on unrestricted and delayed hearings. I can say that we are doing well in this regard.

Understandable, given the kind of night Gostkowski was having. He hadn’t missed three field goals in a game in his career — until Monday. That sort of night from one of the most accurate kickers in league history, too.
 But with the game on the line, Gostkowski came through. He signed with Tennessee on Sept. 3 as a free agent to shore up the team’s kicking woes. The Titans had the worst field goal unit in the NFL last year when their first four kickers combined to connect on only 44.4% of field goals (8 for 18).
 “I’m grateful for the opportunity,” Gostkowski said of his late-game attempt. “I know I probably didn’t deserve it.”
 Really, though, there were plenty of plays that came back to haunt the Broncos. Like being stopped on fourth-and-goal in the second quarter. Denver tried a shovel pass, but tight end Jake Butt was stopped.

 Millennials love buying luxury names, according to Thomai Serdari, academic director of the Fashion & Luxury MBA at NYU Stern School of Business and brand strategist at Brand(x)Lux.
 Some younger people are environmentally or socially conscious and invest in higher-end labels, buying one quality item that lasts for years or spending more money for a brand with a mission they believe in. Others simply want to treat themselves to a premium handbag, watch or pair of shoes every once in a while.
 “They like to be seen and they like to be photographed on Instagram carrying all the big names,” Serdari says. “Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada and all these luxury brands.”

The Pueblo Ice Arena has been a part of Pueblo for the last 45 years, and like many businesses throughout the city, was forced to close because of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 After Gov. Jared Polis announced his "Protect Our Neighbors" phase on July 7, 2020, the ice arena entered Phase 1 e-opening.
   
 In this phase, the arena is available by reservation only to youth (8 and older) hockey, high school hockey, freestyle figure skating practice, learn to skate classes and adult hockey. The on ice capacity is limited to 10 skaters and two coaches maximum.
   
 The road to reopening has been tedious, but program coordinator Daphne Artichoker said the paperwork to begin offering the remaining skating sessions have been submitted.
   
 "The process is slow," Artichoker said. "We have to put together plans, then the plans go to the rarks and rec department, then to the mayor, then the health department for approval. But it's not going to be open like it was before for quite a while."
   
 Public skating sessions, Artichoker said, will be the last activity to resume because of the factors that play into the sessions.
   
 "You obviously cannot have 100 people in here getting skates and congregating in the lobby," Artichoker added. "On top of that, skates would be considered shared athletic equipment. So it kind of limits what we can do."
   
 Adult drop-in hockey will begin next week, but so far, the other skating sessions that have resumed have gone smoothly, Artichoker said.
   
 The biggest obstacle the arena staff is facing currently, Artichoker noted, is keeping spectators who are allowed into the skate sessions up to date with the safety precautions.
   
 "For all of our activities right now, we are allowing two spectators in per child," Artichoker said. "So keeping them up to date, and them understanding that if they sit in a seat, leaving that seat bottom down so staff know what seats to clean. That's the biggest obstacle right now, making sure everyone understands what we need them to do to help out."
   
 Initially, the guidelines provided by parks and rec included the locker rooms being closed, skaters needed to enter the building dressed with the exception of their skates, no spectators were allowed, player bench areas were closed, and the grandstands were closed.
   
 Some of these guidelines have since eased, Artichoker said.
   
 "For example, when we just opened with the stick and puck, (hockey players) were supposed to come almost fully dressed with the exception of their skates," Artichoker said. "We have since transitioned into using the locker rooms."
   
 The locker rooms have markings on the floor allowing players to see where they can safely be to maintain the proper social distancing guidelines.
   
 Staff, coaches, and skaters are still required to wear masks, but skaters are not required to wear masks while on the ice.
   
 Currently there are four skating sessions on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Skaters are asked not to arrive earlier than 15 minutes prior to the scheduled skating session and leave within 15 minutes following the end of the session to allow staff enough time for proper cleaning and sanitizing before the next session.

The southpaw led Sunrisers to a title triumph in 2016 and has made the tournament his own, winning the 'Orange Cap' thrice.
 Last season, alongside Jonny Bairstow, Warner shattered multiple records including the highest opening partnership in IPL history. The duo single- handedly led Sunrisers to the knockout stage.
 The Australian was the leading run-getter, amassing 692 runs in 12 matches, with eight half-centuries and a ton. While Bairstow scored 445 runs in 10 games, notching up two fifties and a century.
 This year again, the pair will be expected to do the heavy lifting with the bat, while senior India pacer Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and the Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan will be manning the bowling resources. Siddarth Kaul and Shahbaz Nadeem are potent Indian bowling options while Billy Stanlake can crank it up considerably.

 Preparations for the Autumn Series are hardly ideal for the Georgians. While many play in the French Top 14, which is back underway, the home-based players are suffering from lack of action.
 The Georgian Big 10 league is yet to begin since being halted due to the Covid-19 outbreak.
 "It's a negative factor which worries us," said Maisashvili. "Our season starts on October 7, we'll play one round but we also have two to three full contact training sessions a week."
 The problems have extended to the boardroom as well with the national rugby union (GRU) in turmoil after the resignation in August of president Giorgi Gorgaslidze.
 Last month, domestic clubs wrote a letter to the GRU saying they were in a financial crisis but Maisashvili said his outfit would be ready by the start of November.
 Maisashvili was defence coach at last year's World Cup and replaced the long- serving Milton Haig in the top job after the tournament.
 The Kiwi, who came on board after the 2011 World Cup, guided the Lelos to a third-placed pool finish at the 2015 edition in England, a win over Uruguay at the 2019 tournament, and seven successive Ruugy Europe Championships.
 "It's a big responsibility and a big honour to succeed Milton Haig and all my predecessors, to follow Georgia's rich rugby tradition," said Maisashvili.
 Georgia face Scotland in a warm-up Test on October 23 before opening their Autumn Series campaign against England at Twickenham on November 13.

While he has dealt with lower back issues throughout his career, Andrus said “it got worse and worse” and was a different pain this year. That will now be treated with injections instead of surgery. He described inflammation in a tendon that would cause pain throughout his back.

I haven’t been able to concentrate just on the game, I (also) have to concentrate on being able to play nine innings. And I’m too young to think that way right now.”
 When Andrus made his big league debut at the start of 2009, the Rangers moved Michael Young — then 32 himself — to third base after he had been an All-Star shortstop the previous five seasons. Young is still the team’s career leader and Andrus is second on the list for games played, at-bats and triples. Young is also the career leader for hits and runs, with Andrus third in both those categories.
 Young was a full-time third baseman for only one season, in 2010 when the Rangers went to their first World Series before acquiring Adrian Beltre. Young was the designated hitter and played all four infield positions in 2011 when Texas won another American League pennant.
