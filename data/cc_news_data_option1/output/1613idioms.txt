The newspaper reports a plateauing death toll, the accompanying graphic is that familiar stretched curve. I drink my still-terrible coffee, a reminder that I’ll never have the option to quit medicine and become a barista. I’ve been waking up to headlines about mortality and economic devastation caused by coronavirus for over a month now, and it has started to feel mundane. I was already refilling my mug when I realized that my anxiety was absent, replaced by a sense of routine. What is the epidemiological equivalent of the banality of evil? Maybe, the prosaicism of pathology. I finished my breakfast, checked the mail, bleached the door handle, and watched a COVID treatment panel discussion about the utility of blood thinners in the acute phase of disease, all things that are starting to seem like second nature now.

Over 100 humanitarian groups in Switzerland, some Swiss media commentators, and some Swiss politicians and political parties have called upon the Swiss government to take in a portion of the refugees trapped in the overcrowded and unsanitary Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece, in light of the danger of a Covid-19 outbreak in the camp. This a reasonable, measured, and common sense solution that should be adopted immediately, before it is too late. As stated in an editorial by the April 4 edition of the renowned medical journal The Lancet, “Never has the ‘leave no one behind’ pledge felt more urgent.”

The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission (OESC) announced that they will begin issuing Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) next week for Independent contractors, gig workers and other self-employed individuals. These are workers typically not covered by unemployment benefits, but now are included if they lost their job due to the impact of COVID-19 on our economy.
 At the beginning of the pandemic, self-employed workers had to apply and wait for that application to be declined before moving on to the next step. Now you can just apply at https://ui.ok.gov so that you are already in the pipeline when OESC begins sending out checks. If a PUA eligible claimant goes back to work as the state reopens, they will still receive backdated unemployment benefits to when their COVID-19 related job loss or business closure occurred.
 The State Board of Equalization met virtually on Monday and declared a revenue shortfall in the current budget of nearly $417 million.

Apart from the vital last-minute legal moves and interventions by MPs, last- minute on-site interventions had been tried for some years to stop individual deportations. Supporters would go to the airport and try to catch crew members and particularly passengers as they registered for the flight. A leaflet would be used to inform people that a fellow passenger was being deported against their will and might face danger. On a very few occasions a supporter bought a ticket for the flight and once on board stood up and insisted that the person being deported should be taken off the aircraft. Success was rare. But the publicity was adverse, and there have been campaigns to get airlines to stop taking deportees on regular flights. Following one such campaign, Virgin has said it will not take deportees.

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, some legal operations are still proceeding. However, modifications are in place to maintain the health and safety of all parties involved.
 Lawyers and attorneys operate an essential business, so proceedings are ongoing; and although the courts are closed through June 5, cases such as divorces and emergencies are being handled.
 Phyllis Hotchkiss of the Law Office of P.A. Hotchkiss and Associates in Waldorf said the lawyers and attorneys at her office have been working electronically “for a very long time,” making the transition to social distancing relatively seamless.
 “We are very lucky because we have been working electronically prior to the outbreak and the [stay at home] orders,” Hotchkiss said. “We are on the cloud. Everyone can access and print out the same information.”
 She said that she, her secretary and her paralegal have been working from home and one of the lawyers has been going into the Waldorf office, although “not seeing clients.”
 Hotchkiss added that thanks to electronics, communication is easy and she is handling the majority of her clients’ matters via telephone conferences.
 “With electronics, we can communicate in every way with our clients,” Hotchkiss said. “I have been doing a lot of phone conferencing.”
 She added that there is a slot in the door of her office for clients to drop papers off and have an attorney receive them with no social interaction.
 Hotchkiss told the Maryland Independent there has been an uptick in divorce hearings since the coronavirus outbreak, and although this is a difficult time, the lawyers at the office “haven’t skipped a beat.”
 “We are open for business and are trying very hard to do business with the courts,” Hotchkiss said. “Everything is normal except us walking into the courthouses.”
 She said there has been a “slow down to some extent” of cases regarding criminal matters, auto accidents and family matters; and although those cases have seen a decline, she noted there has been an increase in people contacting her in regards to wills.
 “I would like everyone — including all my clients and past clients — to stay safe. That is the most important thing,” Hotchkiss said. “Act smart and there is always a way of legally accomplishing what they need to do.”
 William Burgess of William M. Burgess Law Offices in Waldorf handles personal injuries, so the cases he receives are incoming on a rolling basis.
 “I handle personal injuries, so we have cases still in the pipe,” Burgess said. “We still have access to work. Most of it is done through phone contact.”
 Burgess told the Maryland Independent the office is still operating under the same hours of operation and that he is still an essential worker.
 “The courts are still handling emergency hearings right now, we are still essential,” Burgess said. “All of our clients, for the most part, are directly tied to whether the courts are functioning.”
 Hammad Matin of The Law Office of Hammad Matin in La Plata said it is especially difficult as a criminal justice attorney to handle cases.
 “I think it is a real challenge for all attorneys, especially my defense firm,” Matin said. “Criminal defense cases have to go to court to get resolved; it poses a challenge.”
 Matin told the Maryland Independent that there has been a steep decline in criminal cases, most likely due to the shelter in place order recently imposed.
 “There has been a pretty steep decline [in cases,]” Matin said. “People don’t have a court date, so there is less of a rush to meet with an attorney. People are being very cautious and are staying inside their homes.”
 Matin said one of his main objectives, at this time, is keeping his office safe for himself, his clients and his employees.
 “We are doing everything we can to make my office safe,” Matin said. “We are working really hard to practice social distancing. We try to limit their interactions with the public.”
 Matin told the Maryland Independent that he is personally handling all of the meetings with clients in an effort to protect them.
 “I have several people in the office,” Matin said. “We encourage all of our clients to do phone conferences via Skype, or FaceTime. If they insist on meeting in person because of the nature of their case, I will meet with them one-on-one.”
 He told the Maryland Independent that it took a crisis like this for him to realize the gratitude and love he has for his career.
 “It took this type of a crisis to realize how much I miss being in court and how much I miss my job,” Matin said. “I want to make sure I am more thankful when things are up and running.”

In 2001, the campaign initiated the Barbed Wire Britain Network to End Refugee and Migrant Detention, active for some 15 years from 2002. BWB helped to organise campaigns and demos at detention centres, called the only UK demonstration against the European Union’s Returns Directive of 2008 (which ‘allowed’ detention up to 18 months), organised meetings in Parliament with MPs, and jointly organised a national demo in in London with the NCADC and the Campaign to Defend Asylum Seekers which had several years of activity in the early 2000s.

Phil Neville will step down from coaching the England women's team when his contract expires next year, missing out on leading the country at the rescheduled European Championship in 2022. The former Manchester United player could still coach the British Olympic team. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Tokyo Games have been pushed back a year to July 2021 — the endpoint for Neville's England contract.
 Sue Campbell, the English Football Association's director of women's football, said she “will now discuss next steps” about the Olympics with the British Olympic Association and the federations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The Olympics start in July 2021. The 43-year-old Neville, who took charge of England in January 2018, took the Lionesses to the semifinals of the World Cup last year in his first job in women's football.
 But seven of the last 11 games have been lost, a dismal run that started with the semifinal loss to the U.S. and included a defeat in a reunion with the world champions at the invitational SheBelieves Cup last month. England only has friendly matches until the European Championship since it qualified as hosts for a tournament that was due to be staged in July 2021.
 The coronavirus outbreak led to the men's Euros being postponed until 2021, which led on Thursday to UEFA confirming the need to delay its women's showpiece until July 6-31 2022. "As a result of the changes to the proposed tournament scheduling we will now be working to plan for a revised match calendar once it is safe and appropriate to do so," Neville said. "I am looking forward to getting back to work with the team as soon as possible. We have a fantastic squad of players and there is plenty to work on as we look to progress as a team going into 2021.” The FA wants the same manager in charge of England's next two tournaments.
 "In light of the impact of current global events on the sporting calendar and in the best interests of the England Women's team, both parties were in agreement that our shared priority was to ensure the Lionesses have continuity of coaching going into the home EURO and looking towards the 2023 FIFA World Cup," Campbell said. "Once football returns after this difficult period, Phil will continue his work with the Lionesses on the further development of his squad. I will support him fully with that important task whilst moving forward with the crucial succession planning process."

Quando in un caldo pomeriggio di aprile di un anno fa' io e Angelo ci incontrammo ai mitici Five Cats Studios di Pradamano» mi racconta Fabrizio Citossi «io non avevo idea di come avremmo potuto registrare le voci essendo la musica alquanto irregolare e quindi non pareva semplice incastrarci le parole, soprattutto per uno che di mestiere non fa il cantante, ma … sorpresa, Angelo con piglio da cantante jazz imbroccò' tutto alla prima registrazione! Ricordo che registrammo due versioni di ogni pezzo ma solo per sicurezza.

Some politicians have expressed the position that Switzerland should not “go it alone”. But this concern is misguided and has been criticized as merely an excuse. Indeed, the opposite is true. This is a classic collective action problem. If the refugees in the Greek camps were distributed equitably among the countries of Europe, there would be more than enough room and ability to integrate them, but no single country wants to commit to taking in a significant number of refugees without assurances that its neighbors will also do so. Switzerland, with its humanitarian tradition, high per-capita wealth, strong NGO community, relatively small number of refugees, independence from the EU, and excellent international reputation, should lead the way. By accepting its fair share of refugees, Switzerland would demonstrate its solidarity with the poorer countries of the EU, like Greece and Italy, who have a disproportionate number of refugees relative to their resources, and set an example to the rest of Europe.

For all that "Upload" uses a setting -- an afterlife whose pleasures come at a cost -- that by now we know can bear fruit and generate intrigue, the only thing on the show's mind seems to be keeping its story going. The most meaningful ambiguities come in the form of mystery around the story of Nathan (Robbie Amell), a fellow who seems to have been murdered for reasons whose obscurity doesn't make them more compelling. Nathan, amiably blank, seems to have no overarching opinion about the situation in which he finds himself other than that it's unusual; Nora, his "angel," or designated customer- service representative (played by Andy Allo) seems to be falling for him, but it's unclear what, precisely, she's seeing.

Because she was seen by our OB/Gyn team a couple days prior, I call the OB/Gyn consult just to touch base, mostly to ensure the patient has follow up. To my surprise, the consultant comes by the ER to see the patient, even though I told her it was not necessary. Again, my resident and I exchange a look—our consultants have all been exceptionally nice and helpful during this whole time of Covid crisis.

However, he said Bolsonaro had been seeking to change the top federal police officer since the second half of 2019 without giving an adequate reason. Moro said Bolsonaro told him he wanted a federal police chief who would provide him with intelligence reports, which Moro found "inappropriate". Moro also said that Bolsonaro was concerned about Supreme Court inquiries, without giving details.

Poverty is a terminal illness in itself, and it’s why the hardest hit neighborhoods, in the hospitals where I’ve spent my career, report the highest piles of bodies. Bodies who had insufficient access to preventative medical care, healthy diets, and too many people squeezed into a tiny apartment. COVID can kill you no matter how much money you have. But not having it correlates closely with the risk factors that make it much more likely to kill you and the people you love.

When that song started playing it was so special just musically that she kind of looked at us and was like, 'Can I sing on this?'

PUNE: IT companies located in the massive Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park at Hinjewadi are unable to function from their premises in spite of a partial relaxation announced by Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar on Thursday.
 Mhaisekar, on Thursday, had allowed the IT industries to function provided their employees resided temporarily within the IT Park premises at Hinjewadi. He had specified that no movement of employees would be allowed from the containment zones in the city and the companies would have to make on-campus arrangements for the stay of their essential staff.
 The IT Park at Hinjewadi employs nearly two lakh people who reside mostly in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic areas and accounts for an annual software exports of $5 billion (Rs 10,000 crore), according to the Hinjewadi Industries Association.
 The lockdown in the whole of Pune has been enforced firmly by the district administration with a view to contain the spread of the Covid-19 disease. So far nearly 60 people have died of the disease in Pune as of April 23 with five wards, primarily in central Pune, being worst affected.
 Reacting to the announcement, the Hinjewadi Industries Association (HIA), the umbrella body of software technology companies, said that it was difficult for IT firms to operate under the set conditions. has said that that the administration and the police directives on starting the software companies was not in unison which was making it difficult to restart the shutdown sector.
 HIA's Chief Operating Officer (COO), Col ( retd ) Charanjeet Bhogal said, the police was not issuing travel permits to the staff even though the district administration had earlier said that IT firms would be exempted from the lockdown under essential services.
 He said since employees could not travel from the containment zones in the city, the entire process of running operations was at a standstill. "The final call can be taken only after May 3 after taking into account the on the ground situation ," Bhogal said.
 MIDC's Pune general manager Ajit Deshmukh also maintained that IT employees cannot travel outside their containment zones under the present circumstances. Things could normalise only after May 3 which is the last day of extended lockdown, he said.

In a well-rehearsed operation, they cut through the perimeter fence and locked on round the undercarriage of a Titan Airways aircraft and a scaffold pole tripod they erected behind the wing, thus immobilising the aircraft. The plane  was being prepared on the tarmac apron some distance from the runway for a deportation flight to Nigeria and Ghana. The demonstators remained in position for 10 hours in the rain, chanting, shouting slogans, and displaying a banner.

BERLIN (AP) — Organizers of a year-long international Arctic science expedition say they have found a way to keep going despite difficulties caused by the pandemic lockdown, but it will require a three-week break in the mission.Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research said Friday that the expedition ship RV Polarstern will leave its position in the high Arctic next month and break through the surrounding sea ice to rendezvous with two German vessels bringing supplies and crew replacements.The maneuver is necessary because travel restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus make a planned resupply by air or sea from Norway or Russia impossible.Expedition leader Markus Rex told The Associated Press that the lockdown could have scuttled the remainder of the mission.“For a long time it was on a knife edge and there was even a possibility that the expedition might have to be broken off,” he said.The 140-million-euro ($158 million) expedition set out last September with 100 scientists and crew from 17 nations including the United States, France, China and Britain. Its goal is to study the impact of global warming on the Arctic and improve scientific models used to forecast how the climate will change worldwide.As temperatures in the Arctic plummeted and the ocean surface froze over last fall, scientists built a research camp on the ice with the Polarstern acting as their base.Rex said expedition members will have to pause numerous scientific measurements during the three-week supply run, but that this was preferable to abandoning the mission entirely.“In view of the massive challenge caused by the global pandemic, we're very glad that we can do this," he said. If all goes well, the Polarstern will return to its research post and continue the expedition until October as planned.Two Twin Otter aircraft that came in via Canada were able to land on the ice next to Polarstern Wednesday and pick up seven team members who urgently needed to return home, but the planes were too small to allow for the larger crew rotation and resupply required.Rex said that new crew members who will arrive by ship to replace those currently on board Polarstern will have to spend 14 days in quarantine in the German port city of Bremerhaven first, to ensure they are coronavirus- free.Being cut off from the rest of the world on a sea of ice has afforded those currently on the expedition small perks not possible elsewhere right now, said Rex.“It’s one of the last human communities in the world where a hundred people can have a barbecue together," he said.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Calvert County staff is making revisions to the proposed the Fiscal Year 2021 budget, but how much of a reduction will ultimately be needed is still up in the air.
 On Tuesday, the county commissioners heard from Finance and Budget Director Tim Hayden and deputy director Beth Richmond.
 The staff has already proposed a $322 million General Fund budget, which includes a half-cent property tax reduction.
 Staff was seeking direction from the commissioners, with a public hearing on the budget slated for May 18 and adoption on June 2.
 “You’re in a tough spot today,” Hayden said. “The unknowns are off the chart.”
 He suggested a reduction of $3.7 million in revenue for the county, citing the “worst-case scenario” of a $2.8 billion revenue decrease in the last quarter of the current state budget.
 Hayden said the reduction would leave the county with a “temporary surplus” of $500,000.
 Staff also mentioned a possible “flat FY 2021 budget,” albeit one that includes an additional $4.1 million for education above the current $313 million budget.
 The commissioners directed Hayden and staff to proceed with their revisions, but not before rejecting an effort to add some new positions.
 Commissioner Mike Hart (R) motioned that the county hire a full-time veterinarian at the Linda L. Kelley Animal Shelter, instead of continuing to contract for one on an as-needed basis.
 Commissioner’s President Kelly D. McConkey (R) seconded Hart’s motion, but it was defeated 3-2.
 “It should’ve been done two years ago,” Hart said in discussion before the vote.
 “If we don’t get this person [hired] now, we may not get them,” McConkey said, adding that there is a shortage of veterinarians in the county currently. McConkey asked Public Safety Director Jackie Vaughn if hiring a full-time vet would save money. She said it would in the long run because more services could be offered and animal adoption costs would be lowered.
 “We do not know today what we really need to know,” county administrator Mark Willis said, referring to the overall budget picture.
 Commissioner Thomas E. “Tim” Hutchins (R) then motioned that the county defer adding any new positions until January, which was seconded by Earl F. “Buddy” Hance(R).
 The motion passed unanimously.
 Among other new positions that were postponed include eight Emergency Medical Services staff and 15 law enforcement officers, including four courtroom deputies, one corrections officer and 10 deputies.
 Food assistance
 In other news, the commissioners unanimously voted to spend $140,000 from the Contingency Fund to provide food assistance for Calvert County food pantries.
 Community Resources Director Jennifer Moreland told the commissioners that contributions are down due to church closures and a lack of supply at the Maryland Food Bank as a result of demand related to the impact of the coronavirus in the area.
 “The next five weeks are a critical time for our residents, and $140,000 would ensure adequate supply at our food pantries during that time,” she wrote in the request.
 “My fear is ... we may be doing this again, so just food for thought,” Hart said.
 “It’s heartbreaking,” Hance said. “There’s people showing up who have never shown up before.”
