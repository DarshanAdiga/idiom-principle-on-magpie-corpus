Meanwhile, Floyd Mayweather has claimed McGregor "can't punch" and says he is open to a rematch with the Dubliner.
 The pair clashed in 2017 when the American stopped McGregor in the tenth round of their boxing bout in Las Vegas.
 The Notorious is eyeing fights with Dustin Poirier and Manny Pacquiao in the coming months, but a rematch with Mayweather may also interest McGregor.
 'Money' claims he could earn $300million from a bout with McGregor and has also hinted at facing UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.
