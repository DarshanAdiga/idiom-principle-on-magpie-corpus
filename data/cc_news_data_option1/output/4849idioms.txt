Carter and Beck collected Johnson's disability checks to serve as his caretakers in their home for about two years, Cook County prosecutors said Wednesday. Johnson, who was in his 40s, had schizoaffective and bipolar disorders and a history of seizures, prosecutors said.
 Johnson's bruised body was found June 25 after an anonymous tip, authorities said.
 Beck, claiming to be his sister, had reported Johnson missing two days earlier, Assistant State's Attorney James Murphy said in court.
 Following a police investigation and the arrest of the three suspects, Beck told investigators that the death happened after Johnson defecated in the home and exposed himself to the couple's children, Murphy said.
 An eyewitness told investigators that she saw Carter punishing Johnson by making him bend over to touch his toes for several hours and that Carter struck the man with a wooden stick every time he got out of position, Murphy said.
 The witness said that she saw Carter hit the man in the ribs with a large chain and that she saw him enter a room with a hammer and heard the victim cry out in pain.
 Police traced the anonymous tip to Gray, who admitted that Carter paid him $100 to help clean up the scene where Johnson was killed and hide the body.
 Cook County Circuit Judge John F. Lyke Jr. denied bail for Carter and Gray, while ordering Beck held in lieu of $1 million bail.
 "What the state just read to me shocked the conscious to say the least," Lyke said. "And if all of this is true, it's wickedness and evilness on a whole other level."
 It was not clear whether the three defendants have attorneys who might comment on the case.

Bloomberg) -- James Wolfensohn, the onetime Salomon Brothers partner who was appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton to head the World Bank and became one of its longest-serving leaders, has died. He was 86.
 Wolfensohn died Tuesday, according to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he served as a past board chairman. No cause was cited.
 The Australian-born financier rose to prominence in the 1970s as head of investment banking at Salomon Brothers. He piqued the interest of Washington power brokers when the New York-based firm helped Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker arrange a $1.5 billion loan package for the 1979 bailout of Chrysler Corp. in the then-biggest corporate rescue in U.S. history. In 1995, Volcker became chairman of Wolfensohn’s New York-based investment firm, Wolfensohn & Co. Volcker died in 2019.
 Mentioned as a possible successor to World Bank President Robert McNamara in the early 1980s, Wolfensohn gave up his Australian citizenship to become an American so that he would be eligible for the job. Overlooked on that occasion, he began the first of his two five-year terms in 1995 and became the third leader in the institution’s history to be reappointed. Only McNamara and Eugene Black served longer in the post.
 The World Bank was created in 1944 and has been traditionally headed by a U.S. citizen.
 ‘Global Leader’
 “Jim Wolfensohn is not only a hero to the world’s poor, but a pre-eminent global leader in politics, philanthropy, business and finance, the arts, international security, and even sports,” Michael Beschloss, an author of books about American presidents, said in a review of Wolfensohn’s 2010 autobiography, “A Global Life.”
 Under Wolfensohn’s leadership, the Washington-based organization focused on poverty reduction through education and on reconstruction efforts in war-torn countries such as Rwanda and Bosnia. The World Bank also became one of the largest financiers of primary education, basic health, HIV/AIDS programs and the environment, according to its website.
 He shook up the institution’s bureaucracy, accelerated the shift away from infrastructure projects such as hydroelectric dams -- which are difficult for poorer nations to maintain -- to more social-sector lending programs and fighting poverty. He also moved some staff out of Washington to work in the field on World Bank programs, according to a 1997 New York Times article.
 A 1996 initiative by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund erased at least $53 billion in debt for 27 countries, according to figures compiled a year before he left office in 2005.
 “Tens of billions of dollars of debt were forgiven and then the money that was going to these countries was able to be used for education, health care and real, proper development,” Wolfensohn said in a 2010 interview with Charlie Rose. “It was a very, very important change in the development cycle.”
 Early Life
 James David Wolfensohn was born Dec. 1, 1933, in Sydney, the second of two children to immigrant parents. His father, Hyman Wolfensohn, was English and had worked for the Rothschild banking family in London before emigrating to Australia. Dora, his Belgian-born mother, was a singer and kindergarten teacher who exposed her son to music. Wolfensohn later became an accomplished cellist.
 Raised in an affluent suburb of Sydney, Wolfensohn’s family struggled financially during the Great Depression. His father, who worked in advertising and business consulting in Australia, had accrued debts and failed to adapt to life in their new country, Wolfensohn said in his autobiography.
 “The money problem made me terribly upset,” he said. “I grew up knowing we didn’t have much of it and hating the fact that it was such a dominating problem.”
 Wolfensohn attended Woollahra Public School and Sydney Boys High School before earning degrees in arts and law at the University of Sydney. He worked for the Sydney law firm Allen Allen & Hemsley, was an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force and represented Australia in fencing at the 1956 Olympics.
 After enrolling at Harvard Business School in 1957, where he became friends with billionaire David Rockefeller Jr., he graduated with a master’s in business administration. Wolfensohn credited Rockefeller -- the grandson of oil baron John D. Rockefeller -- with the opportunities he found in his adopted country. He later became a Rockefeller Foundation director.
 After his studies, Wolfensohn returned to Sydney and was a managing director at Darling & Co. before joining investment bank Schroders Ltd. in London in 1970. Six years later, he moved to Salomon Brothers in New York and became an executive partner.
 “Once the Chrysler deal had ended, everything had come to a head for me,” he said. “I’d realized that I’d worked for other people my entire life.”
 Passed Over
 Overlooked for the post of World Bank president in 1981, he set up his own investment firm in New York. He sold his stake when he moved to the World Bank and the firm was bought by Bankers Trust New York Corp. for about $210 million in 1996, according to a New York Times story at the time.
 After leaving the World Bank in 2005, Wolfensohn was appointed U.S. special envoy to mediate the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. He held the job for about a year before starting a private-equity firm, Wolfensohn Fund Management, focusing on emerging-market investments.
 Wolfensohn was chairman of Carnegie Hall, where he gave cello performances, and oversaw the restoration of its landmark building in New York. He also headed the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and was chairman of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
 He and his wife, Elaine, an education specialist who died in 2020, had three children: Sara, Naomi, and Adam. Naomi is partner at Wolfensohn Fund Management; Adam is co-managing partner at Encourage Capital; Sara, a concert pianist, is director of the Wolfensohn Family Foundation.

After a good night of fishing they were following the faint trail back to their car. In the dark they heard heavy footfalls on the trail in front of them. “It” stayed just ahead of them as they cautiously continued. They finally came to a clearing, and “it,” a huge human-like creature, was about 20 feet away looking back at them. The pair reported: “It turned 90 degrees up river and took off running through dense brush, in the black of night, like a running back for the Rams, like no human can!”

A former wildlife biologist, Moretti used to venture into the field every couple weeks to locate animals fitted with radio collars. These days scientists can follow animals from their computers in almost real time, gathering vastly more data with a lot less trouble.
 They watch as big game animals in the West chase emerging spring greenery to ever-higher elevations, then return to lowlands to avoid the worst of winter's cold and snow. Some mavericks meander off on their own squiggly computer lines. Most follow the crowd — or literally the herd — on migration corridors, a kind of highway for animals.
 "The big highways, a lot of the herd is using. Once you identify those, that becomes an important target for conservation," said Matthew Kauffman, USGS lead scientist for the mapping project.
 Human development — homes, roads, fences, oil and gas fields and mining operations — increasingly interferes with Western migrations, sometimes with little awareness of what's at stake for animals cherished by wildlife watchers and hunters alike.
 Mule deer, for example, plummeted in number when home development surged in the Wyoming ski enclave of Jackson Hole decades ago, said Mike Eastman, a writer and wildlife photographer who grew up in the area and used to guide hunters there.
 "Mule deer are real susceptible to a lot of people in an area, and it just kind of pinches them off," Eastman said. "They're kind of like steelhead or salmon and can't get up there because a dam is in the way."
 Fences that impede mule deer — big-eared cousins of whitetail deer — or pronghorn antelope can be deadly. Roads, such as Interstate 80 from Wyoming to California, also hold up and kill migrating big game animals.
 While some animals, such as migratory birds, can genetically inherit knowledge about when and where to migrate, others learn from their elders. Reintroduced populations of Western big game animals need decades to rediscover migration routes, research suggests.
 Even so, remarkable migrations persisit in the West.
 Over the past decade, Kauffman and others have used GPS to map migrations including the second-longest known in North America, a 300-mile (500-kilometer) round-trip journey mule deer make each year between a desert and high mountain ranges in western Wyoming.
 The science-guided conservation projects included the $2.1 million purchase of half a square mile (1.5 square kilometers) of land earmarked for home development near Pinedale, Wyoming. The 2015 purchase with public and private funds helped ensure that 5,000 mule deer can continue to pass through a migration "bottleneck" where the town and a lake narrow the path of the animals.
 Before the purchase, many of the mule deer had to squeeze through small openings in a fence to make their journey. The purchase led to the removal of almost 3 miles (5 kilometers) of fence as well as saving the area from development.
 Wyoming also has been leaning on migration research to build what could be dozens of animal underpasses to make roads safer and reduce 6,000 collisions with big game animals each year.
 The new migration atlas documents 26 migration corridors, 16 migration routes, 25 places where wildlife linger while migrating and nine areas where animals congregate during winter. It shows:
 — In Arizona, highways including Interstate 40 affect the movement of antelope west of Flagstaff. Meanwhile, mule deer migrating between the Grand Canyon and summer range in the San Francisco Peaks north of Flagstaff must contend with highways busy with visitors to Grand Canyon National Park.
 — Drought and attacks by wolves and grizzly bears have diminished a more than 30-mile (50-kilometer) elk migration between Yellowstone National Park and foothills west of Cody, Wyoming. The atlas also contains maps of bison and moose movements in and near Yellowstone.
 — In northeastern Nevada, fences and a gold mine challenge mule deer that migrate between the Pequop Mountains in winter and Jarbidge Mountains in summer despite construction of wildlife overpasses and underpasses on I-80 and U.S. 93.
 The atlas itself doesn't advocate policy regarding the handling of animal migrations and contains "just the science," Kauffman said. Still, policy- makers have taken notice.
 A variety of public and private funding is available to help wildlife agencies with projects such as replacing fences so they're low enough for mule deer to leap or have barb-free bottom wires high enough for antelope to scramble under, said Doug Brimeyer, Wyoming Game and Fish Department wildlife coordinator.
 "We can put a proposal together and use the atlas to kind of show those areas are important," Brimeyer said.
 Then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in 2018 established the multi-state wildlife corridor mapping team led by Kauffman. U.S. officials so far haven't designated wildlife corridors that could affect oil and gas leasing or wind power projects on vast federal lands in the West.
 Wyoming plans to use the data to continue its carrot-not-stick approach to protecting migrations. Gov. Mark Gordon in February designated three mule deer migration corridors with plans for others where state officials would encourage but not force help from landowners.
 "These maps can point to the threats and also the solutions. And we now have a whole toolbox full of tools that we can use to maintain these migration corridors," Kauffman said.
 A second volume of the atlas, detailing dozens more routes in California, Colorado, Montana and Washington state, is in the works for 2021.
