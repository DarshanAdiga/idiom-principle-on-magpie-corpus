If you’ve been to Edgartown, odds are you’ve encountered the black and blue sign featuring a mermaid who looks suspiciously like Angelina Jolie. Curious, you’ve probably pulled into the parking lot, finding a beautiful cedar barn and luscious nursery. Inside, you’re greeted once again by that mermaid, this time, atop the bar pulls showing off a wide range of locally crafted and brewed beers. This unique brewery, Bad Martha Farmer’s Brewery, pulls their name and logo from the lore of Captain Gosnold, who found himself on the island, searching for the ingredients to make ale for his crew. One night, a mermaid appeared to him and showed him a field full of grapes. Instead of making wine, he used the leaves to brew ale, a technique still used by Bad Martha brewers today.

CANTON — Harriet Butler didn’t know there was a pandemic until she went to the store without a mask. She doesn’t care who’s the president as she doesn’t follow the news. The only communication she has with the outside world is through a landline telephone, but maybe the only thing she needs lives right next door.
 If it wasn’t for her neighbor, Mrs. Butler, 85, would likely still be with no running water, a broken furnace, leaky roof and a raccoon inside eating her cat food.
 Harriet Butler has lived alone on a modest piece of property near Deer River in St. Lawrence County for 30 years. There was a two-story house she stayed in until time wore it down and it collapsed. Now there’s a trailer alongside it, where she lives with her nine cats. There’s a tire with a full-grown tree through it in the yard. Near the driveway is what appears to be an active deer trail, but it’s really the inches-wide path she used to walk through before her neighbor came in and hacked the waist-high brush that covered the property and hugged the trailer. Her furnace has been broken for two years, forcing her to use two portable heaters during the winter. Most of all, she has been without running water for the last year. She has been pulling a hand cart down the road with three empty jugs to a store when she needs to refill. She said she’s always been independent, and she takes it as a handout whenever someone comes to help.
 But then Joe J. Bullock came into her life. Mr. Bullock has lived next door with his wife, Tina, for seven years. They moved out there in part to get away from cellphone service, or for the Sunday mornings along the lazy river. He’s a disabled Marine veteran who works for the state Department of Transportation. He remembers meeting Mrs. Butler casually and then telling her to come visit him if she ever needs anything.
 Over the years he saw the conditions at her house deteriorate, but he also came to learn how little she wanted help. It took years until she started reaching out to him. Mr. Bullock took this as his opportunity to help as much as he could. She called him when ice froze her front door shut, trapping her inside. A section of her old house had collapsed and landed on the porch to her trailer. He and a friend removed it in a day, no problem.
 And he kept working until she got overwhelmed from all the change, so he slowed it up and maintained a balance between wanting to help her and respecting her space.
 About a month ago is when it all changed. She had spent the winter without running water, and now a raccoon had been crawling through a hole in her trailer and was eating her cat food. Respectfully, he changed his tune and became something of a boss.
 “It got to the point where I said, ‘You’re my adopted grandmother and you’re not going to live like this anymore,’” Mr. Bullock said. “Enough was enough.”
 Fixing everything was the option short of having her move in with him, he said. It got to the point where she would come to him in tears, whether it was because of her broken furnace, reaching out to the city or her cat was missing.
 “I’m in the position where I will never allow her to cry to me again about any situation that’s going on over here,” he said. “She feels like it’s a handout, and I said, ‘Harriet, I’ll help you with anything I can.’”
 He and a friend fixed the furnace a few weeks ago. The ceilings were patched and raccoon hole closed. Her entry is getting fixed.
 Just on Friday, Mr. Bullock got her running water back on.
 “I was hoping that I wouldn’t have to walk to get it this winter again,” she said, “and I won’t.”
 What’s more is his father has offered to donate a trailer, which they plan to place on the property next year.
 But there is a part of Mrs. Butler that likes living the way she does. Walking to get water was a way to keep her mind and hands busy. She built her own shed. Her cats are her babies and the only things she doesn’t want taken away. She has a TV but doesn’t watch it. She said she likes knitting and playing solitaire. She’s in her own little world, as Mr. Bullock puts it.
 “Facebook?” she said before Mr. Bullock says the word computer. “The next one that mentions the word computer I swear I’m going to send them into the middle of next week. I hate the damn things.”
 She said the first time she heard about COVID-19 is when she went to the store late in the spring. She doesn’t get involved with politics as she would rather keep her hands busy fixing things around her home. It’s what keeps her alive, Mr. Bullock said.
 “I stay home and mind my own business and keep out of other people’s business,” she said. “Some people are nosy, but I can’t help what goes on.”
 She got married to one man, who she considers a jackass, and she said she has only truly loved one person. Both are out of her life at this point, and she seems OK with it.
 “If you have enough to live on and enough clothes to wear, be happy with what you’ve got,” she said. “Don’t try to get everything in the world because you ain’t going to get it.”
 The government also got involved after it took notice of a GoFundMe page Mr. Bullock organized, which has raised more than $2,500. The Canton Office for the Aging is going to be sending her meals on Monday, he said, they’re going to look for doctors for her and help with any other avenue they can, he said.
 “Now the situation is they have to go through me,” he said. “I am the mediator. To avoid confusion, everything goes through me. I will oversee everything when it comes to her getting help.”
 It doesn’t stop there. A Facebook fundraiser generated $600 for Mrs. Butler, there have been others through PayPal, and countless other members of the community have donated clothes, shoes and cat food.
 “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Mr. Bullock said. “It’s unbelievable. The support is overwhelming. I don’t ask for help, the same way she doesn’t like asking for help.”
 Mrs. Butler said she’s finally feeling comfortable again. There were times over the years that she had to put up with a lot of the hardship sometimes, she said, without a choice. But now if there’s anything she’s having trouble with, she just calls Joe.
 “I love you,” he says to her, standing in her living room. She looks back at him. “I love you, too, Joe.”

The 71-year-old was sickened in March on a cruise from Australia with his wife, a break after decades of running the family’s Chinese restaurant in Papillion, Neb. In the 74 days he was hospitalized, doctors desperately tried various experimental approaches, including enrolling him in a study of an antiviral drug that ultimately showed promise. Ming died on June 8. “It was just touch and go. Everything they wanted to try we said yes, do it,” said his daughter, Anne Peterson. “We would give anything to have him back, but if what we and he went through would help future patients, that’s what we want.” (Lu Wang via AP)

"That would be unfortunate, especially in light of the fact that Republicans have no plan to replace it," McEachin said.
 Some Republican candidates are trying to avoid outright opposition to the Affordable Care Act because of its popular protection of people with pre- existing health conditions, but Benjamin said he considers the law a failure.
 "The ACA has not been what people thought it would be," he said.
 The Affordable Care Act has resulted in expanded eligibility for Medicaid health coverage for 462,675 Virginians, including more than 122,000 people in the Central Region that includes most of the 4th District. Medicaid expansion, which the General Assembly passed in 2018 after a seven-year partisan fight, also is providing health coverage for almost 130,000 parents, who previously could not qualify unless their incomes were extremely low.

Eastham architect Peter McDonald fit the bill when it came to finding someone to create a design that would stop people in their tracks, literally. McDonald and Paul van Steensel, principal of Cape Dreams Building and Design have been undertaking a bit of a “road trip” in this small, coastal community. The duo has transformed the landscape, arguably for the better, with a slew of projects between Thumpertown and Campground beaches. “Everyone walks along this quiet, sandy road,” Michelle explains, “whether you are on your way to the beach, on your way home from the beach or just out walking your dog. Sometimes it is more people than cars.” It was during one of those walks that Rick and Michelle took notice of a neighbor’s construction project, one that had McDonald and van Steensel’s work fully on display. “The house was coming along nicely, and everyone in the neighborhood was excited,” Michelle remembers. “We talked to the neighbor several times, and he seemed happy with their work. But, when the project was finished he was definitely really happy. That seemed to be a great endorsement.” In the fall of 2018, Rick and Michelle were finally ready to replace the home that they first enjoyed with their pre- school-aged children with a new place to make memories for a new generation that now includes their two granddaughters, Hailey and Bella. McDonald met the couple at the box with yellow shutters and a process of determining what was important to the family began to unfold.

From Ecorse, Michigan, to Howard University, to The Ohio State University, to UMass Amherst to Martha’s Vineyard, Seymour’s path has been more winding than most, but no matter the direction, his art has always been a constant, comforting presence. Seymour left Howard University with a degree in business administration, and after some time in the field, he jokes, “I was not particularly suited in temperament or otherwise to be the great entrepreneur I thought I was going to be.” At the same time, he met his wife, Charlena Seymour, who was pursuing a master’s degree in speech pathology. Though the idea was foreign to Seymour at the time, the thought of a career working with and helping people with disabilities appealed to him. “Next thing you know, I’m in a master’s program for speech pathology at The Ohio State University. I had no idea what that was all about 10 years earlier,” he says. From there, the two earned Ph.Ds. in speech and hearing science, as well as positions at UMass Amherst. All the while, Seymour continued to create and experiment with his art. “When I would get frustrated, or didn’t want to teach a particular class, do another research project, or write another grant, I would always gravitate toward creating art,” he explains.

National View editorials are fact-based conclusions and opinions written by the editorial board of a newspaper or wire service that the Daily News publishes content from. News reporters are not involved or consulted.
 Picture this scenario. It is late on Nov. 3, and President Donald Trump leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- the same three states that put him over the top in 2016 -- based on the votes cast in person on Election Day.
 With his big lead, Trump declares victory. Then, beginning the next day, as early votes cast by mail start to come in, his lead starts to plunge. He screams bloody murder and says the election is being stolen. He provided even more cause for concern this week when he declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
 Given Trump's savage and unfair attacks on mail balloting so far, this scenario is not so far-fetched, particularly because more Democrats than Republicans are expected to vote absentee during this pandemic election. For that reason, states and news organizations need to make clear that voters might not get instant gratification on election night. But it is also important for states to be as expeditious as possible in their counts.
 Unfortunately, a number of states have tied their hands with overly restrictive laws preventing election workers from getting a head start. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the three crucial battleground states cited above -- plus Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, West Virginia and Wyoming -- prevent poll workers from counting, or even processing, ballots until Election Day.
 The shortsightedness of this policy was evident in New York's primaries this year, when poll workers took weeks to determine who had won some key legislative and congressional races.
 Only one state, South Carolina, has changed its laws to allow a faster count, but it applies only to the 2020 election. The legislatures of Michigan and Pennsylvania are in session and could easily change their laws. Indeed, Michigan's Senate last week passed a measure doing just that. The House should follow suit.
 Pennsylvania is in particular need of some advanced time to process ballots. Three factors -- its experience in the primaries; the departure of election officials in a number of counties, according to NBC News; and a complex mail balloting process that requires two envelopes -- point to a potentially arduous vote-counting process.
 One positive is that most states do allow early votes to be processed early, so while results in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin might lag, they might come in much faster in nearby states such as Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio, helping to put the brakes on premature victory declarations.
 Florida, moreover, could be the opposite of the problematic Midwest states. It has long had a tradition of massive early voting -- both in person and by mail -- which accounted for 70% of the total in 2016. This year, with a pandemic altering people's behavior, that percentage could be higher. And with Democrats making a push to vote by mail, it is quite possible that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden could take an early lead thanks to the early vote in the all important Sunshine State.
 In any event, it is vital that states do their job and that voters, politicians, journalists and others keep their cool, knowing that the results may take some time.

Officers made an unspecified number of arrests in downtown Portland late Saturday night after they say individuals in a crowd of several hundred protesters threw rocks and shot ball bearings at them, then refused to leave the area after an “unlawful assembly” was declared.
 Police also were heavily criticized on social media for pushing a news media photographer to ground, as he was trying to document them after they tackled and were detaining a person on the sidewalk. An officer can be seen on video grabbing John Rudoff, a freelance photographer who has shot photos for various media organizations, and throwing him to the ground. Rudoff, who was wearing a helmet with “PRESS” stickers affixed to it, can be seen laying on the sidewalk looking stunned as people ask if he’s OK. On Sunday, Rudoff told The Oregonian: “I really am physically OK but am quite annoyed.”
 Rudoff is one of the plaintiffs who had sued the city in federal court, winning a preliminary injunction that made journalists exempt from Portland police orders to disperse when unlawful assemblies or riots are declared yet required journalists to remain to the side and not get in between police and protesters.
 It’s unclear what if any impact Gov. Kate Brown’s order putting Oregon State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office in charge of law enforcement operations in the city on Saturday had on the federal judge’s injunction.
 Oregon Public Broadcasting editor Anna Griffin also said an OPB reporter “was subject to violence at the hands of law enforcement” at Saturday night’s protest.
 Portland Police, Oregon State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office didn’t immediately respond Sunday to requests for comment about the incidents. From the videos, it’s unclear which agencies the officers involved are from.
 Hundreds of people had gathered at demonstrations in the downtown area when the unlawful assembly was announced just before midnight. The crowd had largely dispersed by early Sunday morning, police said.
 The unrest came just hours after a right-wing rally and counterprotesters largely dispersed without serious violence Saturday afternoon. But police were investigating an assault after one person who was documenting the event was pushed to the ground and kicked in the face.
 Separately, police said a criminal citation was issued after officials confiscated firearms, paintball guns, baseball bats and shields from a pickup that was initially stopped for having obscured license plates as it left the rally.
 Oregon State Police Superintendent Travis Hampton and Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese praised the minimal violence in a joint statement late Saturday. “On Saturday, Oregonians denounced hate, racism and violence,” Reese stated, adding that, “(our) Unified Command was able to help keep the peace.”

The New England Paragliding and Hang Gliding Club (NEPHC) lists four official flying sites: Mt. Tom in Holyoke, MA; Cannon Mountain in Franconia, NH; Plymouth, MA; and Wellfleet. Club president, pilot, flight instructor and instructor trainer John Gallagher notes that while these are the club’s official launch points, there are other unofficial spots to soar. In fact, he sometimes flies in his paraglider from friends’ lawns on Martha’s Vineyard, where he has a home. One might think that like skiers, when paragliders start at the top of a peak, they will lose altitude more or less continuously, making turns along the way to slow the descent and prolong the ride. However, this is not necessarily the case. Instead, paragliders or hang gliders will often launch and ride the air currents and winds upwards, far exceeding the altitude of their jumping off point. This is especially true of thermal flying, when pilots take advantage of columns of rising air. Gallagher says, “On a thermal, you can go all the way up to the cloud base. It might be 70 degrees on the ground, but by the time you get up there, the temperature could be as low as 40 degrees, even sometimes as low as zero.”

As a child, trips to the barbershop weren’t always my favorite thing to do, but I always loved the results. I’d have an attitude going to the barbershop but would be smiling ear to ear when I left.
 There’s just something about that fresh cut that has you feeling like you’re on top of the world.
 Not only do you look and feel good when leaving the barbershop, you always leave knowing something you didn’t when you got there.

"This has been on the slow burner for five months, but now the syringe,” he added.
 Town Councilman Robert Iannaccone said the council should put a focus the “peaceful, safe and quiet aspects of peoples' properties.”
 “This is something we should not be afraid to litigate,” he said. “We should issue a cease and desist order. It's in the courts. Why wait for the courts?”
 Mayor Timothy Dougherty said even though the home violated the zoning laws, “I just can't go in and remove people,” he said. “I know it’s frustrating.”
 Pawar said there is a process that must be followed.
 The town sent a cease and desist letter to the site in April saying they are in violation of the zoning ordinance. They had 30 days to remedy but they didn’t, Pawar said.
 “We issued the violation,” he said.
 Pawar noted the town's position has not changed.
 “The township has always been consistent,” he said. “You have to follow the law and you have to go to the Board of Adjustment to obtain a zoning variance. You cannot simply start operating a commercial establishment in this residential neighborhood.”
 The case may be moving along. The home's attorney agreed with the town's claim the matter is a legal issue and all that needs to be done is to send legal briefs to a judge and have him rule without a bench trial
 “The town has submitted our briefs,” Pawar said, adding the home has not yet done so but still has time.
 Pawar noted bench trials are not being held during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How have you been handling the stress of our weird world situation (aka The Pandemic) these days? In such an unprecedented time, just making it through the day at times seems to be enough. I’d like to say I’m one of those people who learned how to speak a different language, lost 30 pounds, or started an exciting online business. Instead, I have a few more flowers in and around my deck; I’ve read a few more books, and I’ve spent entirely too long bookmarking a plethora of places I want to go and stay while looking at the Airbnb app on my phone.
 I’ve watched too many shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime; I’ve eaten too much butter; I’ve pounded my “mad song” on my piano when no one was around to know that I was mad.

These are characters that could have gone haywire in different hands, but Hawley's writing and direction, as well as his ability to think outside the box as far as casting is concerned, keeps these parts from getting too silly.

 Picture this scenario. It is late on Nov. 3, and President Donald Trump leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- the same three states that put him over the top in 2016 -- based on the votes cast in person on Election Day.
 With his big lead, Trump declares victory. Then, beginning the next day, as early votes cast by mail start to come in, his lead starts to plunge. He screams bloody murder and says the election is being stolen. He provided even more cause for concern this week when he declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
 Given Trump's savage and unfair attacks on mail balloting so far, this scenario is not so far-fetched, particularly because more Democrats than Republicans are expected to vote absentee during this pandemic election. For that reason, states and news organizations need to make clear that voters might not get instant gratification on election night. But it is also important for states to be as expeditious as possible in their counts.
 Unfortunately, a number of states have tied their hands with overly restrictive laws preventing election workers from getting a head start. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the three crucial battleground states cited above -- plus Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, West Virginia and Wyoming -- prevent poll workers from counting, or even processing, ballots until Election Day.
 The shortsightedness of this policy was evident in New York's primaries this year, when poll workers took weeks to determine who had won some key legislative and congressional races.
 Only one state, South Carolina, has changed its laws to allow a faster count, but it applies only to the 2020 election. The legislatures of Michigan and Pennsylvania are in session and could easily change their laws. Indeed, Michigan's Senate last week passed a measure doing just that. The House should follow suit.
 Pennsylvania is in particular need of some advanced time to process ballots. Three factors -- its experience in the primaries; the departure of election officials in a number of counties, according to NBC News; and a complex mail balloting process that requires two envelopes -- point to a potentially arduous vote-counting process.
 One positive is that most states do allow early votes to be processed early, so while results in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin might lag, they might come in much faster in nearby states such as Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio, helping to put the brakes on premature victory declarations.
 Florida, moreover, could be the opposite of the problematic Midwest states. It has long had a tradition of massive early voting -- both in person and by mail -- which accounted for 70% of the total in 2016. This year, with a pandemic altering people's behavior, that percentage could be higher. And with Democrats making a push to vote by mail, it is quite possible that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden could take an early lead thanks to the early vote in the all important Sunshine State.
 In any event, it is vital that states do their job and that voters, politicians, journalists and others keep their cool, knowing that the results may take some time.

Before April, the home had been lived in by a group of college students and before that it had been boarded up for two years following a fire in 2012 that had claimed the life of its owner.
 Franklin Street resident TJ George told the council his residence is closest to 1 Shady Lane, with the home’s property line sitting 30 feet from the balcony of his bedroom.
 He noted he and his wife have a garden planted on their side of a fence between them in the home and the residents of the home throw garbage over it “that tends to accumulate in that garden.”
 “Last week we found a vaping device and examining further we found a syringe and had Morristown Police remove it," he said. "I've never lived in a place where people throw garbage over their fences. These residents don't seem to be respecting the neighbors."
 Debbie Crump of 13 Shady Lane noted that for the past two weeks there have been multiple cars parked at the home in the evening, with women pulling up to park after 9 p.m without parking stickers and she wanted to know if the house is coed.
 She noted a hazmat team had cleaned 1 Shady Lane on July 17 and 18.
 "We were told the city can't do anything about it unless the house presented a safety hazard," she said. "Well, drug paraphernalia and Covid are safety health hazards."
 Alba Rossi-George, the wife of TJ George, said the residents of the home, “hang out and scream and play loud music. Today I could not keep my windows open because they were outside screaming and cursing. Our quality of life has deteriorated since this commercial business has been installed behind my house."
 Michael Quattro of Franklin St. complained both about Shady Lane and also about how Morristown Police will not issue noise citations to Morristown Medical Center nearby, which he called the “800 pound gorilla in the room."
