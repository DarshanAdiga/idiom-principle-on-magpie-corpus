Forest carbon stock is the amount of carbon that has been sequestered from the atmosphere and stored within the forest ecosystem, mainly within living biomass and soil and to a lesser extent, in dead wood and litter.

The study is already a nightmare, featuring an entire bookshelf filled with books, which are difficult to get back into place once I've picked them up and examined them for spiders. Things get worse when I shoot a picture hanging on the wall, which falls to the floor and knocks a lamp aside which knocks _another_ picture off the wall, and bumps a small trashcan which dislodges a mama spider which scurries into the gamer room while I try to smash it with my clipboard. I kill mama who then ejects four spiderlings which I try and fail to kill with my shotgun, which somehow summons two more regular spiders from... somewhere.
 It's a calamity of scurrying spiders, shotgun blasts, and items getting jostled and falling over. I didn't trash the place, exactly, but the house is slowly turning into a crime scene. Lots of things askew and errant blast marks on the floor and walls. My beautiful home!

First off, yes, having ADHD does mean being neurodivergent, or neuroatypical. ADHD is not laziness or ditziness or impulsivity. It's a physical difference in our brains which means those of us on the ADHD spectrum (and like autism, it is a spectrum) process information and emotion differently than is generally accepted as "normal." This leads us to the next and maybe the most important thing we need to change about the conversations around ADHD: the name itself.

“The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game: it’s a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good and that could be good again.”
 James Earl Jones’ quote in the 1989 movie "Field of Dreams" proves to be just as true today as it was when he uttered the words more than 30 years ago. Even during a global pandemic, baseball continues to thrive and provides a sense of normalcy. Although the summer baseball seasons didn’t get off to a regular start, we’re now seeing ball games at every level, from the MLB down to youth.
 Here in Minnesota, amateur baseball – better known as “town ball” – is quenching the thirst of many for live action sports. The Minnesota Baseball Association recently released state tournament brackets for its three classes and 15 current Gustavus baseball players have the opportunity to play for a state championship.
 In Class C, the most popular class throughout the state, nine Gusties will compete for the state title, hosted by Springfield and Milroy over the next three weekends. Class C teams who qualify for the state tourney are allowed to draft three pitchers from non-qualifying teams in their respective regions. Although the Cologne Hollanders did not make a repeat appearance at state, four Gusties on the Hollanders’ roster were drafted in Region 7 – Carter Clemensen (Sr., Cologne) and Jayce Luna (So., Le Sueur) to Waconia, Christian Johnson (Sr., Buffalo) to Young America, and Torben Urdahl (Sr., Chanhassen) to Carver.
 Other Gusties competing in the Class C state tourney include Michael Anderson (Sr., Lake Crystal) with St. Clair, Bryce Novak (So., Cleveland) with New Prague, Jacob Christenson (Sr., Cannon Falls) with Cannon Falls, Nick Fischer (Sr., Courtland) with New Ulm, and Damon Rademacher (Sr., Princeton) with Mora.
 Class B has most of its teams concentrated in the suburban metro and three Gusties will compete for a championship over the next three weekends at the host site Shakopee. Ethan Mocchi (Sr., Champlin) and Charlie Hutchinson (Sr., Maple Grove) with Champlin Park, and Jack Garrison (Jr., Chanhassen) with Victoria.
 The Class A tournament, which features teams within the 494/696 metro loop, is in full swing at the host site St. Anthony Village. Kathan Decker (So., Apple Valley) plays for the St. Paul Capitals, Jack Hanson (Jr., Minnetonka) is with Minnetonka, and Andrew Gustafson (So., Maplewood) is with Stockmen’s Irish.
 “When the guys leave for the summer we’d love to have them play in the Northwoods League, but when you look at some of these town ball rosters, there are a lot of great players which provides great competition,” Head Coach Brad Baker said. “This is a great experience for our players and allows them to continue to play when they are not on campus.”
 To add to the players competing for a state amateur championship, there are also a handful of Gusties playing in the Northwoods League, which is a summer development league for elite college baseball players. Christian Johnson, Ethan Mocchi, and Patrick Timmer (So., Lakeville) are playing locally for the Mankato Moondogs, while Damon Rademacher and Michael Anderson are with the Rochester Honkers.
 Two-sport athletes are also making an appearance at the state amateur tournament. Gustie football player Kevin Durham (So., Gaylord) is with Gaylord, while Gustie men’s hockey player Logan Norman (Sr., Luverne) is with Luverne. Another notable is athletic trainer Mitch Bockenstedt pitching for New Ulm. The list could be further extended with numerous former Gustavus student-athletes still playing town ball.

Guess who's back? That's right, the Red Hood fan series managed to hit their goal and are storming back with Jason Todd and Damian Wayne as Jason has been seriously questioning his superhero roots and the real meaning of justice. As he seeks to put the heroism and days of being a crimefighter behind him, Damian manages to pull him back into the fray so that they might be able to discover the mystery behind The Court of Owls, one of their most pervasive and frustrating enemies. As of season three, they're also on the trail of their former partner and brother Richard Grayson, who's rumored to have become the new Talon. Unfortunately, there's a new evil looming over Gotham, a force that many fans will recognize as one of the most dangerous and brutal enemies that their mentor, Batman, has ever faced, and a force that could put them to the test in a way that they're simply not ready for. It might be time to call in the Batman, or perhaps the entire Justice League considering the threat that Bane represents. For many fans, the emergence of Bane is usually a moment that demands a gasp of surprise as well as apprehension since it's well known just what Bane has done to Batman in the past, and to think that he might not be able to do the same to Jason and Damian is something that could possibly make many fans quake since if the Batman had trouble standing against Bane, then those he trained might need something else to tip the scales in their favor.

Regular and structured engagement with the public is also important. We don’t do enough to take stock of progress. Public discourse concentrates on announcements of new initiatives or the early stages of policy processes, but not as much on progress and impact. This causes frustration on both ends: society thinks not much is being done; government feels progress is not acknowledged. I imagine the media landscape could accommodate a monthly question-and-answer session between journalists and the economics cluster to bridge this gap. We saw how regular media engagement by ministers to unpack issues has been useful during the Covid-19 crisis. A monthly Q&A on matters such as the economic recovery package, economic reforms underway and response to headline economic indicators such as unemployment and growth released in that month would help to build a common vision for the economy across society.

"On July 11, the citizens of this parish spoke. On Aug. 15 they spoke again. And on Nov. 3 I am very confident they will come out in a higher percentage to confirm what they have already spoken," she said.
 Foxworth, a registered nurse and U.S. Army veteran, will fill the remainder of a term in Division M that expires Dec. 31. Foxworth and Alexander are the only candidates who qualified last month for the Nov. 3 election for a full six- year term.
 Foxworth had won 37% of the vote in the July 11 primary to Alexander's 34%. Two other candidates split the remaining vote in the primary.
 The Division M seat opened up when state District Judge Beau Higginbotham, who held the seat, was elected last fall to the 19th JDC's Division C seat nearer to his home. That seat was vacated by retired Judge Lou Daniel.
 Foxworth said during the campaign that she possessed the temperament, leadership skills and legal expertise to sit on the state court bench. She said her criminal court experience is what distinguished her.
 Alexander, who was a lawyer for 16 years before being elected to City Court, touted her 25 years on the bench during the campaign and said her judicial experience is what set her apart.
 Division M is a district that includes Baker, Zachary and Central and extends into Sherwood Forest.

When pit against the Red Hood though it's hard to see Jason coming out on top, even with Damian's help, and even with Nightwing's or the Batman's since this is the guy that put Batman on the shelf. Venom or no running through his veins, Bane is simply a dangerous individual since he's strong, he's quick, and he's not a brainless brute. The guy knows how to fight and he's incredibly tough, more so than even the average villain. He's proven to be the kind of bad guy that people believe will actually follow through on his threats and isn't about to offer a lot of idle chatter when it comes to getting the job done. If Bane is really stepping out of the shadows in this coming season then the Red Hood and anyone with him will need every possible advantage they can get, since otherwise the steamroller known as Bane is going to crush them by lunchtime and forget them by the time dinner is well and over. Okay it's a strange analogy but you get the point, Bane is no one to be trifled with, and considering how well the series has done with its characters thus far there's every possibility that it will represent Bane in one of the best ways possible. If you haven't watched seasons 1 and 2 of the Red Hood then it might be time to brush up on your knowledge and the storyline and get into it, since things are about to heat up in a very real way that will be highly entertaining and more than a little exciting. Be sure to take a look and offer your support to keep the series going, it'll be worth it.

Once the railway network is fully functional, a significant proportion of China’s coking as well as non-coking coal imports might enter the country via trains (from Mongolia and Russia) hurting shipping demand considerably in the long term.

If you can, stay for sunset. Have you ever seen the “green flash?” It’s a rare phenomenon that happens when visibility conditions are just right; it can only be glimpsed for a few seconds as the sun makes its final descent. There’s a noticeable burst of green light at the horizon as the density of the air directly over the ocean gives a prism-like effect to the slanting rays of the sun. Obviously a challenge to photograph!

Maybe twenty minutes from my apartment in Houston is a bánh mì shop called Nguyễn Ngọ. I love how its door always hits me on the way out. I love the voiceless Mariah Carey tracks tinkling in the foreground of steaming pork. I love the crunch of each baguette, smeared with ground protein, intertwined with cilantro and chiles. I love the way that each sandwich’s yolk runs down my mouth, and the neighborhood lady who points to the napkins at the counter, a little sternly, while shepherding her two boys under the table as they kick at each other’s heels—the thing is that she didn’t have to, and that is a form of love, too.

 Complete but unofficial election results, which will be certified by election officials Tuesday, show Foxworth received 9,222 votes to Alexander's 9,195 votes. Foxworth received 50.07% of the vote.
 There were 18,417 votes cast in Saturday's special election, or 18% of the 99,681 qualified voters in the 19th JDC's Division M.
 Alexander, who has served on City Court since 1995, suggested in a Facebook post Monday that the turnout for her Nov. 3 rematch with Foxworth — and the result — will be different.
 "My campaign will continue to run full speed ahead! We are expecting a true indication of the people's voice for the November 3rd Election," she stated. "We are battle-tested, amped & ready for the war! Let's go and get this victory!!"
 Foxworth, who placed first in the July 11 primary, also expressed confidence Monday.

Walter said it’s difficult to know for certain how such a platform will play out in November, but said a lack of popular progressive issues like single- payer Medicare or legalized marijuana could dampen enthusiasm among some voters.
 “If you are expecting them to simply fall in line because you are the lesser of two evils, that is not a sustainable strategy,” Walter said. “If your entire campaign is based on, ‘Well, I’m not the other guy,’ then don’t be disappointed when people who want to see good policy don’t come out and vote for you.”

Edwards in mid-July ordered bars statewide to close, the same day he mandated masks in an effort to get a grip on spiraling cases and hospitalizations. The White House Coronavirus Task Force backed the move as one of the only ways to get infections under control without closing down broad swaths of the economy.
 Feldman wrote in his order the bars had to prove the bar closure had “no real or substantial relation’ to the public health crisis” or that the proclamations are “‘beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion’” of their constitutional rights. But Feldman sided with the governor, citing testimony from Dr. Alex Billioux, the state’s top coronavirus response official, which established why bars are riskier than restaurants.
