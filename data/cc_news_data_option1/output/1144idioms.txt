Older family members are staying home and keeping physical contact with relatives at a minimum during the coronavirus outbreak. Communication can be difficult, especially for seniors who aren't used to turning to technology to socialize.
 Anyone who's watched an older family member struggle to navigate their smartphone might completely write off the idea of gifting them a smart speaker. It's true, your older relatives might need help with initial setup, but once things are up and running smart speakers and smart displays are simple to use.
 But the Google Home ($99 at Walmart) speaker or the smaller Google Nest Mini aren't just for the generations who grew up on the internet. Because they are easy to set up and use, a smart speaker can make a great addition to anyone's household, including your parent's or grandparent's. Here are six reasons why.

The aftermath of Joyce Thomas’ awful death may have cast a pall over prison reform enthusiasm in our state. It cannot.
 The elderly Ville Platte woman was murdered two weeks ago; a longtime inmate paroled in 2019 stands squarely in the center of an investigation into the death of Thomas, who was deaf and mute. There may have been more unthinkable crimes in the history of Evangeline Parish, where Thomas lived, or in St. Landry Parish, where her body was found, but they would be hard to recollect.
 There was no shortage of public outrage over this crime, either. But whatever regret we hold should be aimed at the guilty party, after investigation and trial, and it should drive us to improve our parole laws and practices, not discard them.
 Victims and law enforcement officers opposed early release for the accused man, Phillip Dewoody, 53, who had spent the previous quarter-century behind bars prior to his parole. His crimes in the 1980s were violent and heartless; prosecutors in Ruston recounted his criminal actions involved rape and violent robbery and kidnapping, with “ruthless disregard” for his victims. Why was he freed?
 In short, he was freed because the law as written in 1990 permitted consideration of his release. His parole had nothing to do with recent reforms. He was older than 45 and served more than 20 years, bench marks for parole consideration. His 2018 motion for a parole board hearing — it was his third; others were denied — said his conduct in prison had been good, that he’d served as a trusted prisoner at Angola, that he wasn’t in lockdown. He had sought and completed self-improvement programs, had job and residence plans that ostensibly met basic parole requirements.
 Moreover, the prisoner said he had understood the pain he had caused victims and regretted it. He had changed, he insisted, and would not err again. The accused man still deserves the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. Everybody does.
 On the surface, he looked like a viable candidate for a release — then. Parole is a long process, but it’s not an exact science. Hindsight is always more certain than foresight.
 But Louisianians must remember, too, that we have parole laws for good reason. Louisiana imprisons some 1,500 people for every 100,000 population, at or near the highest rate in America. We cannot continue to bear the financial and human costs of that.
 The easy answer — lock them up, toss the key — failed. The braver, tougher course is to keep improving the system, making Louisiana safer for everyone.

The coronavirus pandemic is believed to be the most serious since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918-19 killed an estimated 50 million people, including 675,000 in the U.S. The official death toll in Minnesota was more than 10,000 and more than 1,700 in North Dakota — estimates experts believe likely understate the grim count.
 As it happened, on Sept. 27, the day Fargo residents were told the epidemic hadn’t yet hit, Minnesota got its first reported influenza case in Wells, between Mankato and Albert Lea in Faribault County.
 That first case was a soldier who returned home on leave, according to the Minnesota Historical Society. Train travel and transoceanic ships carrying passengers and hundreds of thousands of troops enabled much of the rapid spread.
 The day after Minnesota received its first official report, cases began appearing throughout the state.
 The dreaded moment arrived in Fargo on Oct. 4, when Dr. Paul Borkness, the city’s public health officer, announced an eruption of more than 100 cases, including six patients who had developed pneumonia.

Jam session is an opinion forum offering comments on issues from a group of Plymouth residents. It appears on the Forum pages in the Weekend edition of the OCM.
 The newspaper poses a question to the group each week, and participants choose whether to comment. This column is designed to bring the voices of well- informed residents into the Forum page to address issues, one at a time.
 Participants cross the local political spectrum and live throughout the town. Some are current or past Town Meeting representatives, and all are active in the community. We hope their diverse points of view will encourage discussion of the issues Plymouth faces.
 This week's question  
 The Plymouth 400 opening ceremonies have been postponed two months to late June. The Mayflower Sails 2020 event, which was going to welcome Mayflower II's return, in Boston, is being postponed from its May date until - date unknown. Now we're hearing it could take until July or August for the virus to no longer be a concern in the U.S. How do you think Plymouth's 400th anniversary will ultimately be impacted by the coronavirus?
 Pat Adelmann
 The unknown timeline of the COVID 19 outbreak brings so much anxiety to our community. When it is finally over, we will be most relieved, grateful, and eager to celebrate. Participating in the postponed Plymouth 400 events gives us something joyful to anticipate. The impact will be a great outpouring of survivors from 2020 saluting the survivors of 1620.

 Ed Angley
 This is going to be a disaster for all 400th activities. Town hall is closed. Plimouth Plantation is closed. Europe is banned. Asia is banned. This was supposed to be one of the biggest, if not the biggest, tourist season ever for Plymouth and Plimoth Plantation. The tourist season will be over before it starts. I suspect that many restaurants will not survive. Nothing I can do about it.

 Plymouths' birthday is the least of everybody's problems.
 In my opinion there are going to be millions of people out of work due to this sickness. Once this blows over, which could be late summer, people are going to just try to catch up on their unpaid bills. Taking a vacation to Plymouth, Massachusetts, to see something that they can see any other time at all is not going to be their priority.
 Our concern country-wide should be just to get regular businesses back up and running. Then and only then will people start to have disposable income to spend on going on vacations and blowing on a good night out.
 Plymouth as a tourist town is going to take a big hit.
 We will prevail.

 "Suppose they threw a party and nobody came" - tHAT is exactly where we're at. Postpone it for a year. That - in my humble opinion - is the only sensible solution. And while you're at it, add a $1-million reward (insured, like the Jordan's furniture giveaways) for recovery and return of the original Mayflower Compact to Plymouth. Most believe it's destroyed; insurance should be cheap but well worth it for global publicity. I've proposed this for the last several years and it's about time somebody here listened - most of my career has involved PR!

 400th, my life, yours have been all been impacted beyond belief. And all for good (not so good) reason. In regard to 2020, we should extend the celebrations to 2021 and beyond.

 All of the news so far is discouraging and downright depressing. Covid-19 is keeping us in our homes, away from our work, away from our friends. Today was the saddest St. Pats in my life. Tom Brady is leaving New England. Plymouth 400 events postponed, town government cannot meet. Town Meeting is postponed too. Just going to the grocery store is depressing. Restaurants, businesses closed, musicians, waitstaff, workers, cooks, etc., losing their livelihood, and the latest information is making me worry that Project Arts' 25th season is in jeopardy. This very well could be the 400th anniversary, celebrated in 2021.

 David Peck
 Delayed and diminished. Years of preparation for 2020 and now the celebration is being strangled in its crib. Not only the Plymouth 400 events, but all of the programs at the Library, at the Museum, at Wildlands Trust, at Plimoth Plantation - cancelled or postponed. It makes us so very sad. While I grieve the delays, they pale compared to the profound societal pain and disruptions now caused by this pandemic. It is totally appropriate to postpone, however even if the schedule reboots to a June start, attendance would not make up for the loss of the spring months. All those who had planned to come in April, May and early June would not necessarily all come for the opening celebration in its new time. To allow for the current uncertainties about when to restart, I would propose that Plymouth 400 shift all activities to start in the fall, perhaps in September on the 400th anniversary of the sailing of the Mayflower, continue events all fall, including Thanksgiving, and reschedule certain events in 2021. This is not only historically more accurate, but it will help us see our way through what lies ahead.

 While it would be ideal to start the 400 festivities first thing as temperatures warm, there is no reason it can't be held later. While we certainly can't postpone it to the Pilgrims' actual arrival date, Nov. 11, we can wait until summer. Not too early in the summer because the long tail of COVID-19 will still be out there intimidating tourists. August-September seems achievable and Labor Day weekend might work best.

As I noticed during my recent visit to the far north of Germany, at least in my everyday perception.      The imposition of all those nasty little hindrances that seem to cover these islands where land is at a premium and the population in cities is particularly intimate, is completely absent in Hamburg and Lübeck.      Smoking although restricted is allowed in most places, road humps do not exist, speed cameras and the endemic CCTV in every corner of the towns and villages is absent. So I don't see any reason why they should also ignore their imposed rules (on all the rest of us) regarding subsidy and support of lame duck industries, should be any different?      I have an out of date software version of TomTom on my phone, I did not accept their new rental model, and have kept using the one that I paid for. However, I had to use an alternative Czech app (Sygic) at one point because around Lübeck is a brand new motorway system that is absent from the former. This means that it is no more than three years old. Apparently Germans see no problem with building a bypass around their newly created UN world heritage city, for all those non-existent green cars, that will soon be all that is allowed in England.      I do not like Germans that much, I have experience of them during my former employment where lies were part of their idea of contract law. They are generally speaking without any sense of humour, and they clearly believe that they are superior to all other European people. They have never made good on their war reparations, particularly in the Mediterranean, instead they have systematically used the strictures of their EU-Mark (Euro) to undermine the southern economies.      But of course...      We are all in this together.      Hmmmmm.

--DocBreak--
BROCKTON - The careless disposal of cigarettes or other smoking material is suspected as the cause of a three-alarm fire that was put out by Brockton firefighters on Saturday night.
 The Fire Department responded to a three-alarm fire at 32 Huntington St., a triple-decker, wood-frame apartment building, around 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, said Deputy Fire Chief Brian Nardelli.
 The fire displaced six people who lived there, Nardelli said. They were able to find shelter with others, and did not require the assistance of the Red Cross, he said. Everyone got out of the building before firefighters arrived, no one was hurt and no firefighters were injured putting out the fire, Nardelli said.
 When firefighters arrived on the scene, there was heavy fire on the third- floor rear porch, where the blaze originated, Nardell said. The fire extended into the cockloft of the building, which is a small attic space, he said. Firefighters knocked down the blaze within an hour and had it contained, Nardelli said.
 The fire caused about $100,000 in damage, but the building can be restored, Nardelli said. However, if it wasn't for the quick actions of the Brockton firefighters, who used a chainsaw and other tools to open up the ceiling for ventilation, the apartment building could have been a goner, he said.
 "It was a very good stop, as we call it," said Nardelli, reached on Sunday morning. "It's one that could have got excessively worse. The guys were able to keep it in check. ... They did a spectacular job. With a fire like this, once it gets into the walls, there's a real potential to lose the building. It's a race to contain it."
 The fire remains under investigation, Nardelli said, but the initial suspicion of Fire Department investigators is that the fire was caused by the improper disposal of cigarettes or other smoking materials.
 "They're leaning toward the careless disposal of smoking materials," he said.

 This has been a dream season for the Martin girls’ basketball team.   Not only did the Clippers go 19-1 in the regular season—beating Gobles in the regular-season finale to avenge its only loss and secure the outright SAC Lakeshore title—but they also cruised to a district championship before easily beating Colon in a regional semifinal game.   A dream season, indeed.   Sometimes, though, you wake up before the dream has finished.   The afternoon of its scheduled Division 4 regional final St. Joseph Michigan Lutheran on Thursday, March 12, the Clippers learned that all winter sports tournaments were being immediately and indefinitely postponed due to growing concerns regarding COVID-19, or the coronavirus.   “This season has been a magical one for us,” first-year Martin girls’ basketball coach Ben Schipper said. “Up to that point, it has gone exactly as we dreamed it would. Our goal all along has been to be playing our best basketball at the end of the season. I can absolutely say we felt like we were doing that.   “We felt our practice on Wednesday, the day before our regional final, was one of the best practices we have had all year.”   The following day, the MHSAA announced the suspension of all activity in its sponsored sports, putting the spring sports season on hold as well.   “Obviously, this is an unprecedented time for the MHSAA and all of us who are affected by the suspension of winter sports tournaments as well as spring sports,” Schipper said. “There is a lot of uncertainty currently as we have no timetable for continuing our postseason or no guarantee that we will.   “Our team is heartbroken that it unfolded like this, but we understand the number one priority is slowing the spread of the virus and keeping as many people safe as possible. Thursday night after our game was cancelled, we decided to do some team bonding rather than practice. That was much needed for the girls and for me and our coaching staff. It was great to be able to get together and laugh and have fun during a time where we were all very disappointed and shocked.”   Schipper’s players weren’t the only local athletes to be affected by the postponement of the winter tournaments.   The Martin boys’ basketball team was slated to play in a Division 4 district final on Friday, March 13, while the Otsego boys’ basketball team was scheduled to play Grand Rapids South Christian with a Division 2 district title on the line. And swimmers and divers from Allegan, Hamilton, Otsego, Plainwell and Wayland were slated to compete in the state finals beginning that same day.   “Not knowing if our season will continue puts us all in a very difficult spot,” Schipper said. “We can’t practice as school is shut down until after spring break, so we encouraged the girls to shoot hoops at their homes and to try to keep each other’s spirits and morale lifted as much as possible.   “As a coaching staff, we’re trying to make sure our team understands that although this is unfortunate, we have to respect the decision to put health first. We’re just remaining hopeful that we get the chance to finish our postseason. It was incredibly disappointing to get the news of the suspension, but we remain optimistic to be able to keep chasing our goals.”

The state of emergency declared throughout Spain on March 14, in a bid to slow the coronavirus outbreak, is most probably to be extended for another 15 days beyond the original declaration, to a total of 30 days. The measure must first be approved by Congress and assuming it is would see Spain in lockdown until at least April 12, after the popular vacation period of Easter.

If Democrats can pick up Radack’s seat, only one Republican would remain on the commissioners’ court, which would prevent that Republican from breaking the quorum again. But what if the Legislature, learning from Radack’s example, changed the law to require all five members of the commissioners’ court to be present? Many blue counties, even the big Democratic ones like Dallas and Travis, have at least one Republican commissioner who could, if the law were changed, nullify the wishes of the other four and hold one-person veto power over budgetary matters, with huge consequences for local governments across the board. “That would be a pretty major thing,” said Radack, who’s given the issue a good deal of thought. “Probably one of the most major pieces of legislation to come around in a long time.”

Anyhow Michael Matt was on about Holy Mass which was said in The White House on Ash Wednesday. Then tounge in cheek he said " I wonder if Holy Mass was ever said in The White House when the Obamas were there " . There probably were Masses said in The White House when the Horrible Obamas were there , Black Masses. President Trump never had the White House exorcised for nothing after it was vacated by those terrible Human Beings who called themselves Obama. Ad like to know where they plucked that name from . For we all know that the one called Barrack was actually Barry Sotero ,and the one commonly known as Michelle's second name was Robinson. Maybe Victor can set us right on that .

 He said the situation would get better "in the next few days".

The president of Italian football club Brescia who are based in the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic said it was time to cancel the Serie A season because of "the plague".
 Serie A basement dwellers Brescia are destined for relegation -- should the matches ever play out to their logical end in May.
 No ball has been kicked in anger in the football-mad country since March 9 because of an outbreak that bore down on Italy from China last month.
 The nation of 60 million is under a lockdown that could well run for many more weeks.
 Some big Italian clubs have been discussing the idea of resuming practise in preparation for possible matches behind closed doors.
 But Brescia president Massimo Cellino told the Corriere dello Sport newspaper that people who were thinking of playing during a crisis that has killed 4,825 people in Italy were deluding themselves.
 "Everything has to be moved to the next season. It is time for realism, gentlemen. This is the plague," Cellino said.
 Brescia is one of the cities in Italy's northern Lombardy region around Milan most heavily hit by the killer disease.
 Lombardy's death toll surpassed 3,000 on Saturday.
 The region of around 10 million has reported more than 25,000 infections -- about as many as officially counted in Spain.
 "You can no longer play this year. Think about the next one," said Cellino.
 Yet some Italian clubs with title aspirations are planning to resume training next week.
 Second-placed Lazio -- just a point behind perennial champions Juventus -- has said they wanted to resume training as early as Monday.
 Italian media speculate they might postpone it until after the ban on public gatherings formally expires on Wednesday.
 Sixth-placed Napoli also aired plans to start training next week.
 Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has already indicated that all the ban and closures will be extended for weeks if not months.
 Cellino appeared to firmly back Conte's approach.
 "This season is finished. Anyone who wants this cursed (title), take it. It is closed. Finished. And I am not saying this because Brescia is last in the standings," the club president said.
 "We are last because we deserve it."

But the most important scuffle came in October. The commissioners met to pass a tax hike that would increase the county’s revenue by 8 percent before an annual deadline, citing the need to raise money before new laws passed by the state legislature went into effect that would restrict their ability to do so in the future. Cagle and Radack didn’t show up—depriving the court of a quorum and preventing a vote. (State law requires that four of the five members of county commissioners’ courts be present to vote on tax increases.) Hidalgo says the consequences of that missing revenue will hurt the county in the long run. “You won’t see a huge difference from one year to the next,” she said, “but it will compound over time.”
