You may have heard that in my home state of Texas, the governor has allowed salons and barbershops to re-open in an attempt to make his constituents look less like a huge tribe of Wookies. My own stylist, however, is waiting a bit longer before she resumes taking appointments. She told me she needs more time to evaluate the COVID-19 situation in our area, but I think she’s just afraid to face Hank.
 And I don’t blame her. Hank can be a little scary until you get used to him. Recently, Hank woke me up in the middle of the night, startling me out of my sleep as he explored my ear canals. In my hazy dream state, I was afraid there might have been a colony of murder hornets nesting in my aural cavities, but then I realized it was just Hank. And I felt oddly comforted - like an old friend was tickling my lobules. (Weird-I know.)
 So for now, I’ll try to enjoy the time I have left with Hank, watching him grow up - and out. Who knows? Maybe I’ll keep Hank, or at least a version of him. But probably not. My head is hot and heavy. My neck hurts.
 At some point, I’ll have to give Hank his freedom. He is a wild animal, after all. (At least he looks, acts and sometimes smells like one.)
 Until then, I’ll give Hank the same words of encouragement I’ll give you.
 “We’re all in this together!”

For the students who didn’t have computer or internet access, it was even more challenging, leading to paper packets of information. How does a teacher reach a student via paper packets, with no in-person or on-screen lessons? For some students, help came in the form of a phone call.
 And then there were the school nutrition workers, who banded together across Yuma County to make sure students were still fed. That alone was an amazing effort.
 When this crisis hit, our educators didn’t shy away from it. Instead, they worked every angle they could to ensure their students weren’t left behind.
 It wasn’t easy by any means, but teachers, you made it. You are simply amazing, and we are incredibly thankful for you.
 And, parents, thank you too for all the work you’ve done to help your children stay on track. Common Core math? Oy. Many parents out there have a newfound appreciation for how challenging some of these lessons truly are.
 The good news is … this school year has come to a close.. And while we don’t know yet how 2020-21 will look come August, we do know this: our teachers, our students and our parents will rise to the occasion, whatever way it unfolds.
 Enjoy your summer break … this year above all, it’s a well-deserved one!

Τη δική τους αντιπρόταση στη γαλλογερμανική πρόταση για το Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης καταθέτουν η Αυστρία, η Ολλανδία, η Σουηδία και η Δανία. Μέσω non paper που διέρρευσε το Σάββατο, οι τέσσερις χώρες θέτουν τις δικές τους «κόκκινες γραμμές». Υπενθυμίζεται ότι η Άνγκελα Μέρκελ και ο Εμανουέλ Μακρόν προτείνουν τη σύσταση ενός προγράμματος 500 δισ. ευρώ, με τους πόρους να προέρχονται από κοινή έκδοση χρέους μέσω της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής και να διανέμονται στις περιοχές και τους κλάδους που έχουν πληγεί περισσότερο από τις οικονομικές επιπτώσεις της πανδημίας του κορωνοϊού. Δεν πρόκειται δηλαδή με δάνεια βάσει προγράμματος, αλλά για επιχορηγήσεις. Ωστόσο, η έγκριση της πρότασης απαιτεί ομοφωνία στο Ευρωπαϊκό Συμβούλιο. Βασικοί άξονες της αντιπρότασης• Το Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης θα πρέπει να κλείσει εντός διετίας • Η χρηματοδότηση θα πρέπει να γίνει με τη μορφή δανείων και όχι επιχορηγήσεων• Τα δάνεια αυτά θα πρέπει να συνοδεύονται από δέσμευση για μεταρρυθμίσεις και μελλοντική δημοσιονομική προσαρμογήΣύμφωνα με τα τέσσερα κράτη, «στόχος είναι η χορήγηση έκτακτης και στοχευμένης χρηματοδότησης και η προσφορά δανείων με ευνοϊκούς όρους στις χώρες που επηρεάσθηκαν περισσότερο από την κρίση. Δεν μπορούμε να συναινέσουμε σε εργαλεία ή μέτρα που οδηγούν σε αμοιβαιοποίηση χρέους και σημαντικές αυξήσεις στον προϋπολογισμό της Ένωσης».«Να αποτραπεί η πλήρης αμοιβαιοποίηση του χρέους»Σε συνέντευξή του στο γερμανικό σταθμό Deutschlandfunk ο καγκελάριος της Αυστρίας Σεμπάστιαν Κουρτς έδωσε περαιτέρω διευκρινίσεις για την αντιπρόταση των βορείων κρατών. Αναφερόμενος στο γαλλογερμανικό σχέδιο, ο κ. Κουρτς τονίζει ότι το θεωρεί «κατά βάση καλό». Απαιτείται ισχυρή ευρωπαϊκή απάντηση και η βοήθεια θα πρέπει να ρέει γρήγορα και χωρίς γραφειοκρατία. Θα πρέπει όμως να γίνει μια συζήτηση για το «πώς», δηλαδή αν η βοήθεια θα δοθεί προς περιοχές και κλάδους της οικονομίας που πλήττονται από την πανδημία ως επιχορήγηση η οποία δεν θα πρέπει να επιστραφεί ή ως έντοκο δάνειο. Όπως δηλώνει ο Σεμπάστιαν Κουρτς, «θέλουμε να βοηθήσουμε, θέλουμε να δείξουμε αλληλεγγύη, αλλά είμαστε επίσης αφοσιωμένοι στο λαό της χώρας μας», με άλλα λόγια, βοήθεια ναι, αλλά τα χρήματα θα πρέπει να επιστραφούν.«Πολύ πιο σημαντικό» είναι όμως να καθορισθεί ένας χρονικός περιορισμός για την παροχή της έκτακτης βοήθειας. Με το μέτρο αυτό θα αποφευχθεί να μετατραπεί η ΕΕ σε «ένωση χρέους». Σύμφωνα με τον κ. Κουρτς, πολλές χώρου του Νότου και η Γαλλία αξιοποιούν κάθε ευκαιρία προς την κατεύθυνση της «πλήρους αμοιβαιοποίησης του χρέους» των κρατών/μελών της ΕΕ. «Αυτό πρέπει να παρεμποδιστεί», επισημαίνει ο αυστριακός καγκελάριος για να τονίσει στη συνέχεια ότι «στο τέλος της ημέρας όλοι πρέπει να συμφωνήσουν».

For most of the last decade, Libya has been in the midst of a civil conflict that has pitted numerous groups against one another. In the last year or so the conflict boiled down to primarily a civil war between the Western-Libya based Libyan National Army and the Tripoli-based Government of the National Accord. Islamic State, which once had a foothold in Libya, was mostly brushed aside years ago when Sirte was retaken in 2016.
 In the last six months the leader of the LNA, General Khalifa Haftar, laid siege to Tripoli and vowed to take the city.  Haftar and the LNA portrayed the GNA as being hijacked by terrorists and armed gangs. Meanwhile, Turkey signed a deal with the GNA and began sending it support, including Syrian rebels fighters.
 The LNA said Turkey was sending "terrorists." Turkey's government also said that if Tripoli fell then Europe would face a "terrorist threat," apparently meaning that angry locals would resort to terror. Haftar said he had a "mandate from the people," while Turkish pro-government media called Haftar a "warlord," and "putchist" and Qatar called Haftar a "renegade commander."
 In the war of words over Libya the descriptions are important. While media in the UAE describe Tripoli as dominated by "militias," the Qatari media slams Haftar as a renegade and calls the GNA the legitimate government. In general the terminology and level of propaganda has increased in recent months as Turkey's media got its marching orders to portray Haftar as a warlord. There is no semblance of neutrality in most government run media in the Middle East or the local media that is forced to be pro-government.
 In the last several months the pro-Turkish voices became more pronounced, they were accused of taking a more clearly Muslim Brotherhood stance on the Libya conflict and portray it as an "Islamic" cause in which Haftar was anti-Muslim. Haftar's forces are made up of Muslims and there is no evidence that either side is "non-Muslim" or that either side is killing more civilians. But in the world of narratives it is not important what is actually happening, but more important to discredit the other side.
 As part of portraying the conflict through a religious lens certain terms were mobilized, such as suggesting that Libya needed an "inclusive" government or a "shura" council. On the other side are those who are critical of Qatar's role portrayed the GNA as dominated by "Islamists." Qatar has generally backed more religious extremist groups in the region, while those opposed to Qatar, such as Egypt or the UAE, tend to assert that Qatar is fueling extremism and prefer more traditional leaders, such as monarchs or generals.
 As part of the efforts to portray Libya as an "Islamic" issue, even though both sides are Muslim, terms such as "terrorist" are used and  support for Haftar by the UAE was portrayed as somehow anti-Muslim. One can see how regional alliances, such as the Turkey-Qatar alliance and the Egypt-UAE alliance, align their language in Libya. For instance the _Libya Observer_ , which is critical of Haftar slammed Haftar's LNA for "commemorating the so- called Armenian genocide." Why some Libyans would suddenly take Ankara's view on the genocide was entirely linked to Turkish support.
 Turkey's pro-government Anadolu accuses Haftar of being linked to "genocide." At the same time the pro-Turkey media and commentators generally portray Haftar backers as "fascist" or anti-democratic, and assert that Israel and the Assad regime back Haftar. When some Syrian rebels signed on to fight in Libya the portrayal of the conflict as one between "revolutionary" forces in Tripoli and "reactionary" forces was even more heightened. The reality is that Turkey is increasing an authoritarian state where journalists are jailed and dissidents persecuted.
 In the end there may be no clear dividing line between which forces are "religious" or "terrorists" or "warlords" in Libya because the terminology is largely used not due to what the fighters are or what they believe but as a calling card for the region's narratives. Turkey accuses its enemies of being "terrorists" whether they ever did a terrorist bombing or not, while Ankara hosts Hamas, which the US and others view as terrorists. Turkey backs religious extremists but calls is enemies "warlord." The "reactionary" forces aligned with Haftar call their enemies foreign terrorists.
 Another article on Libya at _War on the Rocks_ portrays Haftar as representing traditional and a tribal base of more conservative rule opposed to the chaos that arose out of the Syrian revolution against Muamar Gaddafi in 2011. Haftar's first major offensive, Operation Dignity in Benghazi, was against "Islamists and revolutionary elements." The reality in Libya may be far removed from the press reports in Turkey or Abu Dhabi because those reports are part of a wider struggle.
 Some of the discussions about Libya even appear impressively confusing. Pro- Haftar social media accounts claim he is fighting Al-Qaeda-linked groups and mercenaries. However anti-Haftar accounts claim he is supported by Russian mercenaries and "Janjaweed" from Sudan. Yet, it was Sudan's former regime, with previous links to both Al Qaeda and the Brotherhood, that supported the Janjaweed. The LNA are adamant that, like their supporters in Cairo, they are fighting the Brotherhood.
 In the broader regional narrative states that oppose the Brotherhood tend to also oppose Hezbollah and Iran. Iran's IRGC met with the Brotherhood in Turkey in 2014 to discuss joint work. Yet the Assad regime, which is supported by Iran, is also accused of supporting Haftar. Russia, which sells Turkey S-400s, is slammed by the Pro-Ankara social media for supporting Haftar as well.

Known for its exotic-looking blooms, the hibiscus has earned the title “Queen of the Tropics”. With over 200 varieties and a myriad of brilliantly colored blooms to choose from, you can create your own tropical paradise by planting hibiscuses in your yard. Although the blooms look exotic, this plant is tough and withstands our hot weather well, even blooming during our hottest summer days.
 The 200 or more hibiscus varieties can be categorized into three main types: tropical, perennial and shrub hibiscus. Tropical hibiscus, Hibiscus rosa- sinensis, is the variety sold at most nurseries.
 It is no shrinking violet and produces large blossoms awash with brilliant shades of white, pink, red, orange, purple and yellow. Its vibrant flowers, 4-8 inches wide, scream “Look at me!” to attract the attention of anyone passing by. Its flamboyant blooms also attract a variety of pollinating insects and hummingbirds on the hunt for a tasty meal. The blooms are short- lived, lasting only a day or two. Luckily, in our warm climate, a hibiscus blooms almost year round.

A compressed calendar would mean teams playing matches both in midweek and at weekends while fixtures will be held behind closed doors, with only 197 people allowed to attend, according to a protocol prepared by La Liga.
 Players will also undergo tests for coronavirus the day before games and will have their temperatures taken before being allowed to enter stadiums.
 La Liga's staggered training programme meant players began working individually at training grounds on May 4 and were able to expand into groups of up to 10 players this week.
 The top flight was first suspended on March 12 after Real Madrid went into quarantine on the same day following the positive test of one of the club's basketball players.
 But Tebas has been adamant the league must restart, having estimated that a cancellation of the season would cost clubs around one billion euros ($1.09 billion).
 France's Ligue 1 has been cut short, with Paris Saint-Germain declared champions, while the Bundesliga in Germany became the first major European league to resume behind closed doors last weekend.

The FCC shouldn’t start casting doubt on broadcasting just yet. Last week’s Super Bowl drew the biggest viewership in the history of television, demonstrating broadcasting’s continuing power to command a huge audience, especially to big events like Super Bowl XLIX—and regular-season NFL games claimed most of the top spots in viewership through the fall and into the winter.
 Oh, and the show this year’s Super Bowl beat to claim the title was…last year’s Super Bowl. And this is with hundreds of other channels to choose from—some with puppies on them.
 Even with NBC’s streaming option, most viewers said they planned to watch the game on TV.
 According to a Consumer Electronics Association survey, of the 79% of adults who said they planned to watch the game, 71% said they would watch live on TV, while only 5% said they would watch live online. Add the 8% who said they would keep up with the game afterward through broadcast highlights and the 5% who planned to record it for later viewing, and it’s clear broadcasting remains a force to be reckoned with.

In conclusion, what appears as ethnic, religious and security challenges are actually, in the final analysis, caused by lack of political will to provide good governance. For political expedience, government routinely relies solely on the opinions of people in politics. Most of them are people whose stomachs are their gods and being in government is the paradise they can do or say anything under the sun to cling unto. Therefore, our prayer has and continues to be that government and all other interest groups should ensure social justice to all. Adara nation will do the same whenever the opportunity presents itself. This call is being reiterated because there is clearly a grand design to contrive an environment for the implementation of policies and projects for the appeasement of some interest groups and the emasculation of others.  This is undermining genuine peace to the detriment of all, especially disadvantaged communities like ours.
