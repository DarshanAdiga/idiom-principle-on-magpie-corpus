 # National Guard headed to Pullman to help slow coronavirus
 Associated Press
 PULLMAN (AP) — The number of people testing positive for the coronavirus continues to grow rapidly in Whitman County, and various government agencies are working to slow the spread.
 A team from the Washington National Guard was headed to Pullman on Wednesday to set up a COVID-19 testing operation, according to county Director of Public Health Troy Henderson.
 Meanwhile, police in Pullman continue to issue tickets to people who are gathering in violation of laws intended to curb spread of the virus.
 Henderson said a 25-member team from the National Guard was most recently helping with testing in Yakima.
 Washington State University spokesman Phil Weiler said the National Guard was hoping to set up its testing site in an area known as "apartment land,'' where many WSU students live near campus.
 Adjusted for population size, Pullman has one of the fastest-growing coronavirus outbreaks in the nation, according to a New York Times data dashboard.
 Based on numbers from the last two weeks, Pullman had 5.9 new cases of coronavirus per every 1,000 residents, according to the dashboard.
 On Tuesday, the Whitman County Health Department reported 50 new positive cases of the coronavirus, for a total of 559 cases.
 Most of Pullman's new coronavirus cases have occurred since WSU students began moving back to the area in recent weeks.
 Meanwhile, the Pullman Police Department said Wednesday that it had issued 10 nuisance party infractions over the past six days.
 The nuisance party ordinance prohibits anyone hosting or otherwise allowing a party or permitting certain activities at that party. Prohibited activities include endangering the health of others or activity that is detrimental to public health. Violating Gov. Jay Inslee's COVID-19 proclamations or ignoring health department orders to wear a face mask, social distance, and not gather in groups of more than 10 are violations of the ordinance.
 Violators are subject to a minimum $250 fine for a first offense, and a minimum $350 fine for subsequent offenses.

As stated earlier, NIO has now floated 101.775 million American Depository Shares (ADS) in order to raise additional funds. As a refresher, ADS are U.S. dollar-denominated equity shares of a foreign company that can be purchased on an American stock exchange. NIO has also granted the deal underwriters the flexibility – known as the ‘greenshoe’ option – to purchase an additional 13.275 million ADS within 30 days of the offering. Bear in mind that each ADS represents 1 Class A ordinary share. The entirety of the greenshoe option was utilized by the deal underwriters. NIO has managed to raise around $1.73 billion through this offering.
