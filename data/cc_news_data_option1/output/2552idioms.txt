The curtain re-opener against Southampton, which ended in a 3-0 defeat, was broadcast by Sky - but available to non-subscribers on Freeview channel Pick.
 The next two matches, against Everton in the league and Manchester United in the FA Cup, were both shown on BBC - with the latter attracting an audience of more than 6m people.
 However, City’s next two games, Wednesday’s visit to Arsenal and the home tie with Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday are both scheduled to be shown on BT Sport.
 Subscribers to the channel will be able to find the Arsenal game on BT Sport One - channel 408 on BT TV or Talk Talk, 413/867 on Sky and 527 on Virgin Media.
 For non-subscribers, however, there is no legal way to watch the contest free of charge.
 The Brighton game though, which kicks off at 12.30pm on Saturday, while on the same channel, is being made available for free to Norwich City season ticket holders.
 The club is making BT Sport Match Day Passes available free of charge to all season ticket holders who register before 6pm on July 1 - coincidentally the same time the Arsenal game kicks off.

Student fees for summer 2020 at the University of Kansas were reduced 22% due to the coronavirus pandemic in an effort to ease financial strain on students.
 Seth Wingerter, the student body vice-president for the 2019-20 school year, was on the committee to oversee the status of the fee. With various members of campus administration also in attendance, the fee review sub-committee voted in April to hold the summer fee steady.
 However, Wingerter said he and the head of the committee Jason Hornberger, senior associate vice provost of finance, received a call from higher administration pushing for a reduction.
 “[Hornberger] came back to the committee and said that there was a call from upper administration to do an across the board cut of 22%,” Wingerter said. “From what it sounds like, it was a call down from senior leadership at the University that we needed to cut the fee in order to have less of a financial burden on students.”
 The summer fee is roughly half of what students pay in fees every semester. The fee for summer 2020 was originally set to be $259.40 per student. Wingerter said the Chancellor made the decision to cut the fee down to a flat $200.

True, the initial reopening of the economy has led to a sharp rebound that is projected to continue in the third quarter. Employment rose by 2.5 million in May, while high-frequency data from credit cards and mobility tracking for May and June show sizable bounce backs from April lows, with activity in a few sectors approaching or even exceeding year-earlier levels.
 But the rebound varies by sector and region. Although Big Tech, home- improvement suppliers and retail sales of alcoholic beverages have flourished, travel and leisure have collapsed and will take much longer to recover. And restaurants with drive-through service have fared much better than those able to serve only indoors.
 Most forecasters therefore predict that the early “V-shaped” recovery will slow over the next few quarters, and instead come to resemble the Nike swoosh. But this plausible baseline forecast is subject to greater than normal uncertainty.
 For starters, the shutdown of non-essential businesses in response to the pandemic led to a demand-side shock as well. So far, trillions of dollars in business grants and loans, cash payments to households and unemployment insurance with federal bonus payments (enabling two-thirds of eligible workers to receive benefits that exceed their lost earnings) have provided a cushion to help the economy recover. The U.S. Federal Reserve has pledged to keep its target interest rate until the economy returns to full employment, and it continues to expand the scope of its asset purchases. And a fourth fiscal package expected next month should focus on reopening the economy, including by limiting firms’ legal liability and redirecting bonus payments to encourage employees to return to work.
 How quickly the U.S. recovers from its public health and economic crises will also depend on how well other countries handle them, and vice versa. The World Bank expects 93 percent of countries to slide into recession in 2020, the highest share ever.
 Although the recent spikes in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the U.S. appear manageable for now, given adequate provision of hospital beds and equipment, a significant worsening could trigger new shutdowns or stall further reopening. That would slow the recovery, resulting in economic despair and related health and social problems for many Americans.
 Moreover, America’s twin crises have revealed longer-term problems, starting with the country’s inadequate stockpiles of medical supplies. California, for example, never maintained the supplies then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger built up to combat the 2002-03 SARS epidemic and had to repair hundreds of defective ventilators. And state governments’ antiquated computer systems for processing unemployment claims and dispensing benefits buckled under the pandemic-induced strain.
 In addition, the COVID-19 shock has shown that too many individuals and firms lack the financial margin to weather even a few months of lost income or revenue. It has also both highlighted and worsened racial disparities in health, income, and vulnerability to economic and health shocks.
 These crises elicited massive, rapid, and unprecedented interventionist responses. But government responses enacted under exigent circumstances must control costs better and restore private incentives in the longer term, because history shows that, once launched, public programs and interventions seldom end.
 The economic and health recoveries also heavily depend on the actions of businesses, citizens, and schools, including whether they adhere to recommended precautions such as social distancing, frequent hand washing, and wearing face masks. It remains to be seen whether firms can survive with restrictions on employees and customers, and whether the accelerated digital transformation will be a net plus. The other danger, of course, is a large second wave of the virus that overwhelms hospitals and scares away employees, students and customers.
 One bright spot has been the rapid pace of adaptive innovation. Most U.S. schools quickly continued teaching online following the shutdown, while telemedicine has boomed, helped by the relaxation of government pay restrictions and rules prohibiting inter-state medical consultations. And medical researchers quickly refocused on COVID-19 testing, therapeutics, and vaccines: human trials have started for several promising vaccines, and new tests may be deployed before winter. For the first time, vaccine production capacity will be ramped up simultaneously with testing, so that any safe and effective vaccine that emerges will become available far more quickly.
 But the longer-term problems revealed by the pandemic and the recession will not disappear when these crises end. True, before COVID-19 struck, things finally had started looking up for lower-income workers. Minority unemployment was at an all-time low and wages were rising most rapidly at the bottom of the pay scale. But while strong economic growth will be needed to ensure that these trends resume, there are pockets of people who have been left behind.
 To address this requires reinvigorating policies to broaden school choice, bring private jobs and capital to depressed areas, and ensure better job training (including more apprenticeships and job matching), as well as taking a new approach to overlapping means-tested anti-poverty programs. U.S. welfare recipients face extremely high implicit marginal tax rates in terms of the benefits they lose if they work, with many standing to earn less if they worked than if they remained on the several overlapping programs.
 It is extremely difficult to predict the speed and strength of the U.S. economic recovery with any certainty. What is clear, however, is that we must boost incentives to work in normal times when jobs are plentiful, while strengthening the safety net for when they are not and for those who are unable to work.

Bruce Crocco      Ridgewood - Bruce Anthony Crocco Sr, age 86, a long-time resident of Ridgewood, NJ passed away peacefully on Saturday June 27, 2020 after complications from a long battle with Parkinson's. He was proceeded in death by his parents, Edward and Katherine and brothers, Edward and John. A loving husband and father, he is survived by his high school sweetheart and loving wife of 65 years, Phyllis, sons Bruce Jr (Roxanne) of Columbus, OH, Scott (Ilene) of Saddle River, NJ, daughter Cathy (Lyle Hall) of Thousand Oaks, CA and grandchildren Katie (Justin Maier), Anthony, Liza and Tyler.      Bruce graduated from Ridgewood High School in 1952, lettering in three sports and earning the rank of Eagle Scout. After high school, Bruce went on to the University of Pennsylvania graduating in 1956 with a degree in Business. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity and it was at Penn that he was introduced to the sport of rowing. He joined the crew team and the sport became one of his greatest passions. In 1955, the team made waves across the rowing world after beating top teams around the globe in a race on the River Thames. They won the Grand Challenge Cup, the most prestigious race at the annual Henley Royal Regatta in England. The 1955 University of Pennsylvania crew team was elected into the National Rowing Hall of Fame in 1977 and is still considered today by many as the greatest crew team in the world, even outright invincible. Bruce served as Captain of the team in 1956.      After graduating from college, he spent 40 years as a distinguished executive for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City, National Westminster Bank and Fleet Bank until his retirement in 1999. Upon retiring from the banking industry, Bruce joined Tarvin Realtors selling homes in the town he loved. He remained active in the community tutoring children with special needs in the Ridgewood school system. An avid athlete, he continued to play tennis and golf with friends and family. Travel was an important part of his life. Family vacations were always special whether camping for weeks across the country or sitting on the beach. Bruce and Phyllis ventured out with life-long friends on frequent, adventurous trips to countries around the world. One thing that always remained constant in his retirement was his passion to remain connected to both high school and college friends. He spearheaded many reunions over the years with his 1955 crew teammates, fraternity brothers, Penn alumni, and his Ridgewood High School classmates.      Bruce and Phyllis joined First Presbyterian Church in Ridgewood in the early 1960's where he became a leader from the start. The church was, and continued to be, an important part of their lives and they rarely missed a service. Bruce volunteered in any way he could from teaching Sunday School to serving and leading many committees. He was an active member of the church finance committee up until his passing.      A memorial service to celebrate Bruce's life will be held at a future date.      In lieu of flowers please consider a memorial contribution to either:      First Presbyterian Church of Ridgewood, NJ      722 East Ridgewood Avenue      Ridgewood, NJ 07450      or      The Michael J.
