As many of you know, I grew up in a large family in rural Arizona. When it comes to politics, my family members are split down party lines. As you could imagine, I have seen a fair share of heated political debates at dinner tables. But at the end of the day, we are and always will be family. We’re Arizonans with similar struggles and similar hopes.


  In the Arizona that I know and love, we pride ourselves on being independent thinkers and advocates for our individual liberties and respect for our neighbors, no matter the adversities we’re facing. United we stand, divided we fall, as the saying goes.


  And the truth is, Arizonans are suffering right now. We are suffering through many crises simultaneously — a virus hurting high-risk populations, an economic hit on our small business and workforce, racial injustices rampant, threats to slash our Social Security earned benefits and our U.S. Post Offices, and overall bitter partisanship in our communities. All that said, we have overcome difficulties in the past, and we have emerged from them stronger than before. Despite the daily challenges 2020 has doled out to us, I still believe that we can overcome this, too.

The Trump campaign has denied it has any involvement in West's presidential bid. West has suggested he will soldier on even though the millions of dollars he has dumped into the race has so far managed to get him on the ballot in just 12 states. Mathematically, the rap superstar cannot win the presidency. He is on the ballot, however, in battlegrounds such as Minnesota, Iowa and Colorado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The public responses were mostly positive, and I am sure they were truthful. Every school is different, and in some cases the school leadership and parents are working together to ensure a clean environment, considering the masks, the distancing, and other COVID-19 distractions.


  But the ones who communicated with me privately painted a different picture. As with most of us, their summer vacation was not very restful. Teachers were reluctant to travel, so they spent their summer planning how to approach their new challenges. Would they continue to conduct class remotely, while coping with spotty internet connections? Or would they venture into the potentially dangerous world of crowded school hallways?


  When some of the teachers returned to school, they were promised ample supplies of wipes, tissues, paper towels, disinfectants, and cleaners. They were assured that extra cleaning crews would be on hand around the clock, making sure surfaces would be scrubbed, trash cans would be emptied, and risks would be minimized.


  Sadly, that has not always been the case. In my home county, after a few weeks of phased-in attendance, the doors were finally opened to all, five days a week. Almost immediately, several buildings were closed again for sanitization and contact tracing. When a positive case was reported, it was back to the home computer. Entire cheerleading squads and sports teams were under 14-day quarantine, with lucrative, rivalry football games cancelled for the first time ever.


  Our innocent optimism of six months ago is gradually giving way to the grim possibility that we could be living under these conditions for several more months, and maybe even a year or more.


  Successful schools have always been about building relationships. This year, that is happening like never before. Out of necessity, teachers are reinventing the wheel, one day at a time. School buildings have come alive, with a vibrant heartbeat. Kids are adapting, because that’s what they do.


  Let’s salute our teachers, aides, staff members, cafeteria workers, cleaning crews, bus drivers, and administrators. You are making the best of a bad situation, and yes, we see you.


  Ordinarily, I would say, “Hug a teacher.” We can’t do that, but we can offer our appreciation, our prayers, and our support.

D. Weston Darby, Jr., 89, of Honey Brook, Chester County, a former management consultant for law firms across the country, died after a short illness on Sept. 5, 2020. He joined the Philadelphia firm of Daniel J. Cantor and Co. in the early 1960, and later owned the company that specialized in helping legal firms in managing internal problems and creating mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Darby retired in the early 1990s. He was born on April 27, 1931 and grew up at the farm “Glen Hardie” in Valley Forge, the son of the late Jean Brown Scott Darby and late Donald W. Darby. He attended the Haverford School, and graduated from the Taft School in Connecticut, and received his undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1953. He also earned a Masters in Business Administration from Temple University in 1971 and earned a certificate in advanced management from Harvard School of Business Administration in 1981. Inspired by his father, a career military man, Mr. Darby joined the U.S. Marine Corps following his graduation from Yale and received a First Lieutenant commission in December of 1954. He received his flight training with the Marines and became a Marine jet pilot in June, 1955, rising to the rank of Captain in 1958. He was serving as an Aide-de-Camp for General Rote at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina when he resigned his commission in December 1961. He was married the same month to Margarette Ann “Marge” Kortina at St. Bernards Catholic Church in his wife’s hometown of Mt. Lebanon, Pa. The couple spent the month of January on a Honeymoon touring England, Scotland and Europe. They repeated the trip in 1991 when they made the first of more than 30 trips abroad including Africa, India, and a Beijing-St. Petersburg trip on the Oriental Express. Before starting his lifetime career as a consultant, Mr. Darby worked for the Freedom Foundation in Valley Forge. He and his young wife lived first in Valley Forge, and later in Chester Springs, Pa. The family moved to Honey Brook in 1969. Mr. Darby did the all the design work and oversaw the restoration on their 18th-century stone farmhouse and continued his interest in restoring historic area homes. After his retirement, Mr. Darby was devoted to his farm and his local community, serving at one point, for several terms, on the Board of Supervisors of Honey Brook Township. He enjoyed studying military history and collected many books about the American Revolution and colonial history. He also acted on that interest and extensive knowledge by serving in leadership roles in numerous historical and hereditary organizations. Among them, the Mayflower Society, the Colonial Wars, the Colonial Society, and the Sons of the American Revolution. Mr. Darby was active with several clubs on Nantucket Island, where he and his family had a home for 40 years. He was a former member of the Nantucket Yacht Club and continued to be a longtime member of the Wharf Rat Club. The family also spent many summers on Eleuthera, an island in the Bahamas, where Mr. Darby designed and built a house and guest house. In addition to his wife of 59 years, Mr. Darby is survived by his two children, Kortny Shearer and Bruce Darby and two grandchildren. Internment will be private at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, Honey Brook, Pa.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The man who killed John Lennon in 1980 says he was seeking glory and deserved the death penalty for a "despicable" act.


  Mark David Chapman made the comments in response to questions last month from a parole board, which denied him parole for an 11th time. As in previous parole board hearings, the now 65-year-old inmate expressed remorse for gunning down the former Beatle outside the musician's Manhattan apartment building.


  "I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous and that's the only reason and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish," Chapman said, according to a transcript released by the state Monday after an open records request.


  Looking back 40 years later, Chapman called his actions "creepy" and "despicable." He said he thinks all the time about the pain he inflicted on Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono.


  "I just want her to know that she knows her husband like no one else and knows the kind of man he was. I didn't," he said.


  Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as he and Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his recently released album, "Double Fantasy," earlier that day.


  "He was actually kind to me that day," Chapman said.


  Chapman is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Wende Correctional Facility, east of Buffalo. He told the board he would have "no complaint whatsoever" if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life.


  "I deserve zero, nothing. At the time I deserved the death penalty. When you knowingly plot someone's murder and know it's wrong and you do it for yourself, that's a death penalty right there, in my opinion," he said.


  In denying him parole, the board said Chapman committed an "evil act" and said they found his statement that "infamy brings you glory" disturbing.


  Chapman will be up for parole again in August 2022.

 # Local high schools choose traditional seasons
 Karl Zinke
 The Examiner
 All local Eastern Jackson County high schools have decided not to opt for the alternate fall season next spring.
 The Missouri State High School Activities Association announced its district pairings for the regular fall season Monday and all of the local schools are listed.
 Because of the COVID-10 pandemic, MSHSAA in August gave schools the option of an alternate fall season that would begin March 12 and conclude by May 1. Any school opting for that season instead of the traditional fall season would automatically also be included in an alternate spring season that would start May 14 and conclude July 10.
 Schools had until Sept. 11 to announce their intention of using the alternate seasons or remaining with the traditional seasons. All 10 local high schools were listed in the district assignments handed out by MSHSAA Monday.
 Mary Kroening, the St. Michael the Archangel Catholic activities director, said they wanted to give their athletes a chance to compete while they could.
 “The reason we are staying on course is that with COVID, nothing is guaranteed,” Kroening said. “We are getting games in right now and no one knows exactly if it will be any better come the alternate fall season. We want to give our athletes, especially our seniors, every opportunity to play. Every practice and game that our teams partake in is a gift – we don't want to miss out on those moments. Our administration has taken the steps to make sure that we have procedures in place that keeps our athletes and coaches safe.”
 In football, Blue Springs, Blue Springs South and Lee’s Summit North remained in Class 6. Blue Springs and Blue Springs South are in District 4, paired with Liberty and Liberty North, Columbia Hickman and Columbia Rock Bridge, Park Hill and Troy Buchanan.
 Lee’s Summit North is in District 3 along with district rival Lee’s Summit West, Rockhurst and Raymore-Peculiar. The Southwest Missouri schools of Joplin, Nixa and Springfield Kickapoo are also included.
 Grain Valley football moves up to Class 5 for the first time and is paired with new Suburban Middle Six Conference opponents Truman and William Chrisman in District 7. Raytown, Belton, Ruskin and Sedalia Smith-Cotton round out that district.
 Fort Osage remains in Class 5, paired in District 8 with the Northland schools of North Kansas City, Oak Park, Park Hill South, Platte County, Staley and St. Joseph Central.
 Van Horn remains in Class 4, and is paired with Center, Kansas City East, Grandview, Lincoln Prep and Raytown South in District 7.
 Oak Grove remains in Class 3. The Panthers are in District 7 with Odessa, Pleasant Hill, Pembroke Hill, Summit Christian Academy, Kansas City Southeast and Knob Noster.
 St. Michael the Archangel Catholic is in Class 2 District 7 with Lone Jack, Butler, Hogan Prep, Holden, Versailles and Warsaw.

RED DEER, Alta. - RCMP in Alberta say they are investigating after an anti- racism rally in Red Deer turned violent on the weekend.


  News footage from CityTV Edmonton shows counter-protesters shoving demonstrators who had gathered to denounce racism, but no RCMP officers are seen intervening.


  Alberta Justice Minister Kaycee Madu says violence and threats of violence are unacceptable and he has urged the RCMP's commanding officer in Alberta to get to the bottom of what happened.


  Madu says the Mounties have told him they weren't there for the initial confrontation because protest organizers changed the location of the rally at the last minute.


  Kisha Daniels, a co-founder of Black and Indigenous Alliance AB says the RCMP was well-aware of the location change, which was made in response to threats from white supremacist groups.


  Daniels says she had been planning to speak at the rally about education and anti-blackness, but the event was interrupted by Yellow Vesters, Soldiers of Odin and other groups honking their horns, blaring sirens and yelling.


  She calls what happened traumatizing and says so far the RCMP has not reached out, even though she has footage and other information to contribute to any investigation.


  RCMP said in a news release Monday that there was a disturbance as the anti- racism groups were setting up the rally on Sunday.

Banquet Chair and Foundation Board member Sally Olson says it is important for people to understand the importance of HCHC in our community and how donor gifts make a difference. “While this idea is a little more fun-spirited than others in the past, we hope people will realize how important their gift to the Foundation is, especially this year. Each gift makes a huge difference, and helps us move forward with our mission to support and fund important health related projects for HCHC,” Olson said.

Austin Voth threw his first career complete game and earned his first victory in 10 starts this season, and the Washington Nationals staved off playoff elimination with a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the first game of a doubleheader Tuesday.


  The Phillies fell into a tie with Milwaukee and San Francisco for the last wild card spot in the National League.


  Voth (1-5) posted season highs in innings (seven) and strikeouts (seven), allowing three hits and one run. It was an especially welcome effort for the Nationals, who were playing their third doubleheader in five days.


  Philadelphia’s defensive woes didn’t help Aaron Nola (5-4), who yielded five runs (three earned) in six innings while striking out six. Washington collected an unearned run in the first when Juan Soto reached on left fielder Mickey Moniak’s error and scored on Asdrubal Cabrera’s single.

Meanwhile, in the S&P market, Allied said that “on the dry bulk side, it was a rather strong week for the SnP market in terms of activity. The main segments in this, were the medium to smaller sizes. In the Supramaxes, we witness a keen interest for units in the 10-yr age group region. However, with freight returns clearly softening on a y-o-y basis, as well as, the fact that the market seems rather unable to push things further from the current levels, we can’t expect buying appetite to remain stable (in the long-run at least). In the Handysizes, given the upward momentum noted in earnings since the start of the summer period, we can anticipate a vivid SnP market to hold for the near term. On the tankers side, it was also a firm week, with a plethora of fresh deals coming to light. For the time being, we witness a relatively attuned activity across most of the main segments. If the bigger sizes follow closely too, we can hope for a interesting SnP market to develop during the final quarter of the year.

The commission rightly stresses the gap between aspiration and reality in the continuing struggle to realize the promise of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution’s Bill of Rights. The Constitution has required multiple vital amendments in our nation’s long, ongoing struggle for liberty, equality, and full participation by African Americans, women, and so many others. The commission focuses, as it should, on the original sin of slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and the efforts of Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to address the continuing legacy and reality of racial discrimination and inequality. Yet even here, the commission’s originalist methodology gives short shrift to the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and the subsequent jurisprudence and ongoing struggle to make equal protection a reality for African Americans and for so many others.

US Supreme Court justices have life tenures, a sneer-worthy feature for citizens of any democracy since the USA and Iran are the only countries in the world without term limits, or a mandatory retirement age, or both, for their highest judicial authorities. But it does little to erode American exceptionalism or the conviction that the nuts and bolts of a government “of the people, for the people and by the people” envisaged by the Founding Fathers in the late 18th century need oiling or replacements more than 200 years later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Felony charges have been filed against the driver, John Piotrkowski. Authorities said because a likeness of the striking vehicle was shared with the public, a tip to Crime Alert Berks County led them to the suspect vehicle in less than a week.


  "They just happened to be in the right area at the right time and overheard a conversation and reported it to us to investigate," said Det. Sgt. Robert Wood, Northern Berks Regional Police Department.


  Wood said the suspect does have a checkered past.


  "What is going to put him in the doghouse this time is because the charges are going to be felony charges, because he did not have a driver's license," Wood said.


  The police said the the crash happened just before midnight on Aug. 15. Many people, including the police, were concerned about the child being outside late unsupervised.


  "He actually wasn't supposed to be out," said Davidheiser. "He was actually next door with his friends and they were all playing, and all of them actually decided to sneak out and go to their other friend's house."


  The police said Maidencreek Township has a curfew and that the child should not have been out.


  "It is a contributing factor to the crash," said Wood. "Had the child not been there, had the child been with a parent, I think better decisions would be made."


  Piotrkowski remains in the Berks County Jail, unable to post $50,000 bail.

WASHINGTON -- With the death on Friday of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, what will happen to the case of California v. Texas, which deals with whether the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is constitutional? The answer is not entirely clear, according to one legal expert.Currently, the oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Nov. 10, a week after the presidential election. President Trump has said he will announce his nominee to replace Ginsburg -- likely to be a very conservative jurist based on Trump's list of his potential high court picks -- by the end of this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will work to get Trump's pick approved, despite asserting in 2016 that the current president shouldn't name a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year.Rescheduling Oral Arguments a PossibilityWhen it comes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) case, the court's oral arguments schedule can be rearranged, said Miles Zaremski, a healthcare attorney in Chicago and past president of the American College of Legal Medicine. This could occur if, for example, a new justice hasn't yet been approved by the Senate and Chief Justice John Roberts thinks that the likely outcome of the case -- with only eight justices on the court -- will be a 4-4 tie. The Supreme Court historically does not favor ties, Zaremski said in a phone interview, adding that Roberts can just reschedule for after a ninth justice is seated.California v. Texas (a continuation of the case originally known as Texas v. United States) was filed in early 2018 by Texas and 19 other Republican-controlled states. In December 2018, lower-court Judge Reed O'Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas sided with the plaintiffs and agreed that the ACA was unconstitutional after Congress scrapped the individual mandate penalty as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Congress had unequivocally stated time and again that the mandate was essential and inseverable from the rest of the ACA's provisions, O'Connor explained, but rewriting the law without its essential feature was beyond the power of his court.The case was appealed, and in December 2019, a federal appeals court upheld O'Connor's ruling, but told the district judge in the case to look again at whether other parts of the law can still stand. The individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, wrote Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod for the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On the severability question, we remand to the district court to provide additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA as they currently exist.What if There's a Tie?What happens if the case goes forward with only eight justices and it does ultimately come out 4-4? In such a deadlock, the decision of the lower court stands. However, press reports claiming that this would invalidate the entire ACA are incorrect because the Fifth Circuit didn't strike down the entire law, said Zaremski, who previously has contributed opinion pieces to MedPage Today.The Fifth Circuit said, 'Yes, the individual mandate is unconstitutional but we aren't going to make the decision about whether the entire act is constitutional. We're going to send it back to the district court to gather more evidence to see what provisions of the act are severable or inseverable from the mandate.'For example, he continued, The ACA has a provision regarding nutritional guidelines for restaurants ... Does that have anything to do with the taxing power of the Congress and the fact that individual mandate no longer exists? Even if various parts of the law are now deemed inseverable from the mandate, those decisions could again be appealed to the Fifth Circuit, Zaremski added.Another possibility is that Roberts and another normally conservative justice could side with the court's three remaining liberals, resulting in a 5-3 ruling against the plaintiffs. If that happens, the whole case would just go away, Zaremski said. Which conservative jurist might do that? Probably not Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, or Brett Kavanaugh, but [Neil] Gorsuch would maybe be one such person, he said.If the high court waits until a new justice chosen by Trump is seated before hearing the case and making a decision, it could come out 5-4 or 6-3 in favor of the plaintiffs -- and the court could also decide that the rest of the ACA is unconstitutional as well. That would upend the healthcare market nationwide, with all of its provisions, said Zaremski, noting that more than 30 states have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. If the ACA is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then what happens to the expansion that states undertook pursuant to a law that's unconstitutional? That's the gloss over the entire importance of the case.Marie Fishpaw, director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank here, says when it comes to the ACA, congressional action will be needed no matter what. The reality is that no matter how the Supreme Court decides on the pending Obamacare case, Congress must act on health reform, she said in an email. Obamacare has failed to help Americans lower their health care costs or improve their coverage options. A growing body of conservative leaders support the Health Care Choices Proposal, which would address the pressing healthcare needs of Americans. This proposal would lower healthcare costs, protect those with pre- existing conditions, increase coverage choices, and stop surprise billing.The other big question under the new court is what will happen to cases involving abortion. Justice Ginsburg was a champion of abortion access and for other types of reproductive healthcare, said Julie Rikelman, senior director of U.S. litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a phone interview. This is obviously a tremendous loss for the court, and a tremendous change. If Trump ends up appointing another justice to the court, the right to abortion and other reproductive healthcare issues will be in peril like never before, because he's said he'll appoint justices who will automatically overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.A few reproductive rights cases are at the court right now in different procedural stages, Rikelman said; one case involves a state law barring abortion after 15 weeks' gestation, while another has to do with access to medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic.A dozen other cases might be at the court's doorstep in the next 6 months, she said. There are lots of cases pending at appeals courts right now -- lots of other cases in the pipeline.

Denver quarterback injures shoulder, timeline for return uncertain


   


  The Associated Press


   


  ENGLEWOOD -- If only Drew Lock's body was as hard as his head.


   


  For the second straight season, the Denver Broncos' young quarterback will miss significant time time after getting injured while scrambling in vain to avoid a sack.


   


  The mobile QB from Missouri is vowing once again not to change his style.


   


  Last year, Lock missed three months after spraining the thumb on his throwing hand in the preseason. Although he was slated to back up Joe Flacco as a rookie, he missed out on at least three starts once Flacco went on IR at midseason.


   


  Despite paltry practice time, Lock won four of his five starts after being activated in December, entrenching himself as the starter coming into 2020.


   


  Yet on the Broncos' second drive of their second game, Lock was scrambling to his right after narrowly avoiding being sacked by outside linebacker T.J. Watt when fellow linebacker Bud Dupree crashed into him, driving Lock's right (throwing) shoulder into the Heinz Field turf.


   


  Coach Vic Fangio said Monday that Lock could be out until midseason.


   


  "I like to get out and run and I like making plays when they're there," Lock said after Denver's 26-21 loss, his right arm in a sling. "Both times it was close and maybe I could have gotten out of it and not gotten hurt.


   


  "I won't sit here and tell you if I'm close to getting out of it and making the big play for us, that I'm going to lay down and take the sack."


   


  That's just not in his DNA, he said after the Broncos started 0-2 in back-to- back seasons for the first time since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger.


   


  "I'm going to stay aggressive and try to not have these awkward things happen and fall weird," Lock said. "I'm going to stick true to my guns and what got me here, what helped us win a couple games last year and what's going to help us win games this year."


   


  His coach sounded as though he wasn't exactly on board with Lock's approach.


   


  "Well, he could have stepped up and executed, stayed with the play a little bit longer," Fangio said. "And then once you start scrambling and anytime you hit the ground, you're always in danger of getting hurt, particularly at quarterback with the shoulders or anything to your throwing arm can happen."


   


  The Broncos now turn to Jeff Driskel, who threw for 256 yards and two touchdowns after Lock went out but also threw an interception and was sacked six times.


   


  WHAT'S WORKING


   


  The interior of the defensive line continues to shine. Jurrell Casey had his third pass breakup of the season and Shelby Harris forced a fumble that Kareem Jackson recovered.


   


  WHAT NEEDS HELP


   


  The offensive play calling no matter the quarterback. Needing two yards in two plays from the Pittsburgh 15 with less than two minutes remaining, Pat Shurmur didn't call for a handoff to Denver's $16 million man, RB Melvin Gordon. Instead, Shurmur dialed up a pair of passes even though his QBs had been hit 17 times and sacked six.


   


  Incompletion.


   


  Sack.


   


  Game over.


   


  STOCK UP


   


  Safety Justin Simmons, who's playing on the franchise tag after the Broncos' contract talks went nowhere over the summer, picked off a pass, broke up two more and recorded a team-high eight tackles, including one for loss and seven solo.


   


  STOCK DOWN


   


  Shurmur. Aside from curious calls in the red zone again, TE Noah Fant for the second straight week was invincible for one half and invisible in the other.


   


  INJURED


   


  The Broncos are competing with the 49ers for most consequential injuries in 2020. The Broncos' list includes Lock, Courtland Sutton, Von Miller, A.J. Bouye and Phillip Lindsay. San Francisco's list of casualties features Richard Sherman, Jimmy Garoppolo, Raheem Mostert, Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas.


   


  KEY NUMBERS


   


  Six scores in 24 possessions for Denver, which has only been outscored 42-35.


   


  NEXT STEPS


   


  With Tom Brady on deck, the Broncos are going to have to find a way to call better plays for a lesser cast and hope their fortunes on both the field and the injury front turn around.

It's a fine start but if "Kajillionaire" remained in the Dynes' weird and warped bubble, the quirkiness would surely grow a little tiresome. But when another young woman, Melanie (Gina Rodriguez, sensational), joins in some of their hustles, July's film comes alive. Rodriguez -- spirited, confident, sensual -- arrives like an alien into the world of the film. Her presence, and immediate connection with the Dynes' daughter, prompt Old Dolio -- already stirred by a parenting class she was forced to sit through -- to question and challenge her unconventional upbringing. A sense of human connection (so often the yearning behind July's films) begins to belatedly take root for Old Dolio. Something earnest and tender, like soap bubbles in the wall, emerges. And the whimsical, unpredictable artistry of "Kajillionaire" turns out to be no con, at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

  How do you begin to put into words, a man that gave selflessly and loved fearlessly. Our dad valued the little moments, the ones that left lasting memories and secret life lessons. The moments that we will carry with us and share with the world. He treasured spending time with his family narrating our memories like Roald Dahl. As much as any man loves to hunt, fish, build and fabricate, our father loved to take every moment to listen intently to all of our thoughts, hopes and dreams. Never to busy to extend a helping hand, words of wisdom or just have a good “ole heart to heart”. Our dad guaranteed that millions would remain safe in the air, while ensuring his family remained safe and secure on the ground. His personality, larger than life, it filled the room. His presence guaranteed love, laughter and sometimes a sarcastic edge! Some would use the analogy to describe him as, “walking into a room with grenade in hand, pulling the pin, placing the grenade on the table and calmly walking out the door”. His “ANALYTICAL” demeanor was the personification of his very being. How do you put into words, a man that gave selflessly, loved fearlessly and changed the world.


  A burial with Rev. Stephen Rocker will take place at the West Stockholm Cemetery at 2pm on Saturday, September 26th with military honors. Jim is survived by his spouse Donna Hendershot of York, SC; daughters Ann (Chris) Goodrow of Potsdam and Mary (Justin) Bartholomew of Potsdam; stepsons Scott Jandreau of Canton, Fred Jandreau of Florida, Doug (Michelle) Jandreau of Lockheart, SC and Jason Jandreau of Florida; brothers Scott (Marlene) Hendershot of Kentucky, Gary Hendershot of Massean, NY and Ron Hendershot of Georgia; a sister Diane (Larry) Wisig of Florida; 12 grandchildren, 5 great grandchildren and several nieces and nephews.


  Jim is predeceased by a daughter Susan Hendershot and a step daughter Sara Jandreau and a grandchild Jake Hendershot.


  Mr. James Carl Hendershot Jr. was born on August 28, 1956 in Niagara Falls, NY to the late James Carl Hendershot Sr. and Mary Jane Barnes. He was a graduate of Potsdam Central School. He served in the United States Air Force from 1975 until his honorable discharge in 1980. On June 21, 1997 he was married to Donna Birdou.


  Jim was raised in Parishville. As a young kid he became infatuated with airplanes. He would see them fly in the sky and at a young age, he knew he wanted airplanes to be a part of his life. That’s what led him to enlist in the United States Air Force and then eventually work for over 30 years for airline companies. He started at Peedmont Airlines, then US Airways and was currently employed with American Airlines. Jim was an aviation maintenance technician.


  Jim had a love of being around his family. Jim was a wonderful husband. For Donna he fulfilled everything she could have ever imagined. When they met it was magical and the magic remained throughout their whole marriage. Jim gave Donna everything and even more than she ever wanted .He will be greatly missed. He was very proud of completely restoring a 1921 Model A Ford. He loved working with his 3-D printer and recently had purchased a metal engraver.

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (EFE).- El presidente de Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, explico este martes que trabaja con Coca-Cola para ofrecer creditos a 1.2 millones de tenderos a la palabra y sin intereses que ayuden a paliar los efectos de la crisis por la pandemia de la COVID-19.Ellos (Coca-Cola) han hecho el compromiso de hacer una revision para que se entreguen creditos a 1.2 millones de pequeñas tiendas de abarrotes buscando que no haya intereses, que sea a la palabra, aseguro el mandatario desde Palacio Nacional, donde el dia anterior recibio al director ejecutivo a nivel mundial de la compañia, James Quincey.Lopez Obrador explico que hablo con Quincey acerca de los tres millones de creditos de alrededor de 1,000 dolares que el Ejecutivo mexicano se comprometio a dar a inicios de la pandemia a pequeños empresarios y trabajadores, por lo que ofrecio al directivo apoyar a estos tenderos de manera conjunta.Estamos hablando de 1.2 millones de familias.

Practically, West's late start set off a scramble to get him on the ballot. Ballot access is a complicated state-by-state process with requirements such as filing fees or collecting a set number of signatures from voters saying they'd like the option to vote for the candidate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Where does the commission’s prescription fall short? It offers up a solution that is anchored in an overly restrictive methodology and approach. After encouraging readers to look back to the founding principles of our nation and to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the report advances a narrow interpretation of those principles and a form of originalist thinking that elevates the purported understandings in 1776 and 1948 (and a selective spin on those understandings at that) above the developing law, jurisprudence, and understandings of those principles since that time. Even on its own terms, the commission offers a selective and incomplete characterization of the ostensible “original understanding.”

The historical mistreatment of Xicanx (pronounced CHEE or SHE-canx) communities is rooted in nativism and white supremacist ideology that is inextricably linked to the conquest of the Americas and the creation of the United States. The subsequent multiple demonizing forces and ideology emanating from these origins have resulted in quantifiable educational casualties of Xicanx children and youth. In the wake of these forces, Xicanx experiences derived from qualitative studies give voice to how they attempt to fulfill their parents' aspirations while navigating hostile projections upon their communities, their culture, and their identity. Left unchecked, adverse explicit and implicit intentions turn their school campuses into psychological battle grounds. School psychologists possess unique skills and are situated to establish trust with Xicanx communities, and advocate for Xicanx students (by employing strategies that buffer the impact of debilitating forces), rallying other school faculty and administrators to intercede, and ultimately promoting successful outcomes in the face of entrenched forces of nativism and white supremacy. This article will provide a historical context that explains the embeddedness of violence against the Xicanx community but builds upon the hope and promise of children and families who seek to make the US their home and refuge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Meanwhile other roadblocks are things like hardware control, with customers being accustomed to having hardware they can control virtually every aspect of, as opposed to the more abstract, plug-and-play nature of virtual machines and containers. Which is why a big focus of OCI's efforts (and a major differentiating factor for them) is on their bare metal systems. True to the name, these systems are setup without virtualization and offer customers low- level access to the hardware, including BIOS settings as necessary. For containerized applications it's completely unnecessary, but for traditional applications and legacy programs that have never been run on anything but bare metal hardware, it offers a more direct route to transitioning towards cloud hosting.

Iowa State knows all too well about picking up the pieces after a heartbreaking loss and getting in the right frame of mind for the next game. The Cyclones are calling on that experience again heading into their Big 12 opener at TCU on Saturday following their home loss to double-digit underdog Louisiana-Lafayette on Sept. 12. “Obviously we don’t want to be in situations where we have to bounce back after a hard loss,” junior linebacker Mike Rose said Tuesday, “but these past couple years we’ve been in these exact situations. We’ve bounced back before, so we need to have that same attitude of having to go back to work and bouncing back like we have in the past.” The 31-14 loss to the Ragin' Cajuns of the Sun Belt Conference was crushing. It knocked the Cyclones out of the Top 25 and put a damper on the excitement surrounding the team. Iowa State was a trendy pick to make it to the Big 12 championship game for the first time. That goal, of course, remains as Big 12 play begins. The Cyclones are three-point road favorites against a TCU team team picked sixth in the conference. The Horned Frogs on Tuesday named Matthew Downing the starting quarterback for Saturday's game. The Cyclones are 10-4 after losses since 2017. Last season, they followed a one-point loss to Iowa with a 52-point win over Louisiana-Monroe and a two-point loss at Baylor with a 25-point win over TCU. They dropped consecutive close games against Oklahoma State and Oklahoma before beating nationally ranked Texas, 23-21. Coach Matt Campbell said safety Greg Eisworth, defensive lineman JaQuan Bailey and tight end Chase Allen were among the players who spoke up in the locker room immediately after the loss. “That’s where we’ve grown in four or five years, the leadership,\" Campbell...

Transporting the ballots to Augusta for additional tabulations delays results for about a week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

“He said, ‘In 2006, I had the best short-game week of my life,’ and that really stuck out to me for some reason,” DeChambeau said. “But I just knew that if I did hit it in the rough, I'm going to have to get it up-and-down quite a bit.

When the Farmington Board of Education public meetings were F2F, the community would fill out a short form before or during the time allocated for the community to speak before the Board. If a member of the community is requesting a specific item or has a concern, the Board would listen without responding. I do understand that comments by board members during the meeting may not be productive in many ways. However, as a 12 years board member of my homeowner’s association, I would suggest that the superintendent with his central office members, principals, and directors be available to secure the resident’s contact information and provide a written response within a specific time. The same can happen with our current remote board meetings. We must welcome residents’ voices and address their concerns. Surveys, townhall meetings, coffee hours are ways to hear and address residents’ concerns.

Sports being offered at high schools this fall in Arlington, Belmont, Cambridge, Burlington, Lexington, Waltham and Watertown and beyond will look very different this fall compared to past seasons when Covid-19 was non- existent. All athletes, spectators and coaches will be wearing masks. There will be smaller rosters, fewer athletes and coaches on the field during games, fewer spectators in the stands, and a very condensed practice and game schedule. However, many high school athletic directors and coaches agree, despite the challenges, protocols and modifications, the upside is that there will be a season and this will benefit student-athletes not just physically, but also emotionally and socially.


  "I think there's more excitement than anything. A lot of us didn't know if we were going to have a season a few weeks ago. We're just happy to be able to come back and play again," said Lexington High School Boys Soccer Coach Dastan Pakyari. "I'm sure there's some uncertainty but my job as a coach is to communicate what's changed and help the boys work through it. At the end of the day, this is another soccer season for LHS, we're going to build the best team we can, and win as many games as we can."


  Football, cheer, swim and dive, and volleyball are not among the sports being offered this fall. Instead, they will be part of a floating season, Feb. 22 to April 25, because these sports are considered too high risk. However, fans of soccer, golf, cross country and field hockey will have games to watch beginning Sept. 28 through Nov. 21. (crew, fencing, sailing and orienteering are also being offered for Cambridge high school students).


  "We are trying to do everything safely and doing everything we can to give our student-athletes the opportunity to participate and be part of a school community like a normal year. If we can get through 10 games in a positive manner, it would be tremendous for our kids," said Shaun Hart, Burlington High School's athletic director.


  The number of spectators will be limited to one per athlete and the name, phone number and email of all spectators attending will need to be given to the coaches 48 hours before a game or meet. Local cable stations will be videotaping games for everyone else who is not allowed to attend.


  Records will also be kept of everyone present at all team activities including practices and games. Pre-screening for Covid-19 symptoms will be done before all practices and games for all athletes and students. If an athlete or coach has any signs/symptoms of COVID-19, they should not attend practice/game.


  Other safety precautions to be followed include hand sanitizing before and after all team events, social distancing at all times, personal water bottles, personal equipment which must be kept in personal bags six feet apart from other athlete's bags. Everything must be cleaned and disinfected before and immediately following practices and games. Habits such as spitting and licking fingers will not be permitted.


  Every sport allowed this fall will have modifications. Field hockey and soccer have the most modifications, according to Murphy. He said coaches will make sure the students playing understand the new rules but it will be challenging for athletes who have been playing their sport a certain way for so many years.


  "We have good coaches. We will be able to pull it together but it's definitely a donning task," he said.


  Murphy said sign-ups have been better than he expected and many athletes who would normally play football, have joined the Watertown High golf team.


  Game day management is what Murphy is most worried about. "Making sure we put together a good product that keeps two schools safe, not just Watertown. We need to make sure we have the right people working the game and make it a good experience for attendees and athletes. There will be a lot of moving parts," he said.

The visiting head coach was actually the one more disconcerted.


  “I know it was a win but there’s a lot of stuff to work on, a lot to clean up,” said Blue Ridge coach Kirby Elkins. “The best thing about, it’s early in the season, so we’ll take care of that.”


  Blue Ridge struck first in the 10th minute with a hard-earned goal as the WIllcox defense was sharp and goalie Juan Rodriguez III made a couple of stops before the break-through.Twenty minutes later the visitors scored again despite spending 90 percent of the time on the Willcox end of the field.


  The 2-0 lead turned quickly into a 4-0 half-time advantage thanks to sharp play of senior striker Canyon Brosemann.


  Blue Ridge’s final four goals were scored in less than 30-minutes to clinch the game on the mercy rule.


  “I feel good. We played a good game until my kids got tired,” coach Juan Rodriguez said. “I liked the play of junior Beyonce Felix, who hustled well. Sophomore midfielder Alexis Hernandez played really good. Junior forward Eulises Lara played a really good game, too.”


  Willcox will host region rivals Desert Christian, on Friday, and St. Augustine on Oct. 1.

There's still a lot we don't know about the NFL, be it related to workload, matchups, or consistency. Nonetheless, most fantasy football owners _think_ they know it all after two weeks, and that's how they wind up making questionable start 'em, sit 'em decisions that can make or break their week. Fortunately, we're here to help with level-headed Week 3 lineup advice (and DFS picks) that takes into account not only all the stats and trends but also all the injuries that ravaged so many teams last week.


  Yes, injuries were the dominant storyline after Week 2, and that carries over to Week 3. A host of fantasy stars have already been ruled out, and plenty more big-time contributors figure to be "questionable" heading into the weekend. Kenny Golladay (hamstring), Cam Akers (ribs), Jamison Crowder (hamstring), A.J. Brown (knee), Davante Adams (hamstring), Phillip Lindsay (toe), Michael Thomas (ankle), and George Kittle (knee) headline that group, and there will undoubtedly be more added to the list as we get closer to the kickoff.

During the 2019 legislature, while I served in the Montana House of Representatives, I got to know Senator Dan Salomon from Ronan.


  In the midst of the partisanship and game playing often seen in Helena, I noticed Senator Salomon stood apart from other legislators in two key ways. First, Senator Salomon is very approachable. I found him to be someone that is very easy to have a conversation with and who will listen to different ideas and points of view – which is a critical asset to have in a legislator. Second, Senator Salomon has a voting record that demonstrates without any question that he’s in Helena to do the right thing for his constituents and Montana, regardless of politics. We need more of this approach in our state and country if we want government that works for the people.

Two moments were key for Bryson DeChambeau winning the U.S. Open.


  The first one was early in the week, when he played a practice round at Winged Foot with Phil Mickelson. By then, DeChambeau already was sold on his plan of hitting driver every chance he could because it would be difficult for him and everyone else to hit many fairways.


  But it was during that practice round that Mickelson shared his experiences from 2006, when Lefty hit only one fairway in the final round and still nearly won.


  “He said, ‘In 2006, I had the best short-game week of my life,’ and that really stuck out to me for some reason,” DeChambeau said. “But I just knew that if I did hit it in the rough, I’m going to have to get it up-and-down quite a bit. So I made sure that I needed to practice those shots coming into the week, and I did that beautifully.”

Half of the estimated $940 million that proponents say would be raised is for schools to hire teachers and classroom support personnel, a category that also includes librarians, nurses, counselors and coaches. Those dollars also could be used for raises.


  Another quarter would be for support services personnel. That category covers classroom aides, security personnel, food service and transportation.


  There’s 12% for grants for career and technical education programs.


  Another 10% is for mentoring and retaining new teachers in the classroom.


  The last 3% goes to the Arizona Teachers Academy to provide tuition grants for those who go into education.


  “This money goes directly to school districts and it very specifically says what the money can be used for,” said David Lujan, director of the Arizona Center for Economic Progress who helped craft the measure.


  “It cannot be used on administrative costs,” Lujan said. “It can only be used on very specific things.”


  But Jaime Molera, a former state schools chief, said he finds some wiggle room there that could put some dollars into the pockets of administrators. And Molera, retained by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry to spearheaded its opposition to the tax hike, said just that fact alone should give voters pause before approving the measure.


  “Who are the mentors of the teachers?” he asked.


  “I would imagine they’re going to be principals, assistant principals or even superintendents,” Molera said. “There’s no structure against that in this proposition.”


  He conceded that isn’t the way those programs work now, with most mentoring done by other, more senior teachers.


  “But there’s nothing in there that says that that’s exactly how it has to be done,” Molera said.


  The broader attack by foes of Proposition 208 goes to the claim that, overall, way too much education money is being spent outside the classroom.


  In several commercials, Arizonans for Great Schools and a Strong Economy, the Chamber-financed opposition, says that just 55 cents of every dollar goes to the classroom, and that the rest goes to administration and overhead.


  Those numbers are accurate. They come from the most recent report by Auditor General Lindsey Perry, who in March put the figure at 54.7 cents.


  The commercial tells voters not to put more money into education until the financing system is fixed.


  But as Perry’s report spells out, there’s more to this story.


  First, she points out that Arizona schools, on average, spend less on administrative expenses than the rest of the country, an average of $903 per student here versus the most recent national average of $1,383. This category covers superintendents, business managers, clerical and other staff who perform accounting, payroll, purchasing, warehousing, human resource and administrative technology services.


  Potentially more telling is that the 55-cent figure does not include other necessary instructional support like librarians and teacher training. And there are guidance counselors, nurses, speech pathologists and social workers.


  Add the to basic teacher salaries and the total is now 68.8%.


  What’s left, according to the Auditor General’s Office, are things like running the school buses, building maintenance and utilities.


  And there’s something else that Perry said results in Arizona having lower classroom spending than the national average.


  “Many factors may account for Arizona’s lower percentage of instructional spending, one of which is average teacher salary,” Perry wrote. Using the most recent national data available, she found teacher salaries here averaging about $11,500 less than nationally.


  “Another factor that may account for Arizona’s lower percentage of instructional spending is class size,” she reported. In Arizona, there is an average of 18.4 students per teacher, compared with 16 in the rest of the country.


  Molera does not dispute Perry’s findings. But he insists that there are efficiencies that can be had to put more of each dollar in the classroom before simply putting more cash in the pipeline.


  He also said there are other alternatives, such as a proposal by several Republican legislators to increase the current 0.6-cent sales tax for education to a full penny.


  Legislative budget analysts said that could raise an extra nearly $473 million a year, versus the $940 million predicted by proponents of Proposition 208.


  But that idea, which has been around since last year, never got out of the legislature, much less became a ballot proposal as an alternative to the income tax hike. That leaves Prop 208 as the only take-it-or-leave-it proposal for voters.


  Lujan defends the income tax proposal as being the fairest, given a series of tax cuts by state lawmakers in the past decade that he said have largely benefited business and the more wealthy. This is designed so that 96% of Arizonans won’t be affected.


  This proposal relies on Arizona’s tiered income tax system.


  Everyone pays the same rate on the same earnings. So any individual is taxed at 2.59% for the first $26,500 of earnings, 3.34% on everything between that and $53,000, 4.17% on income of $53,001 through $159,000, and 4.5% on everything over that.


  Proposition 208 would add a 3.5% surcharge on individual earnings above $250,000. All figures are doubled for married couples filing jointly.


  A married couple earning $650,000 would pay no additional taxes on the first $500,000. But the rate on the balance would go from $6,750 to $12,000.


  Foes of the initiative said that would give Arizona one of the highest top tax brackets in the nation. But Lujan said that, given the tiered tax system, the overall burden on that couple making $650,000 a year would still be less than in 34 other states.


  As to targeting the wealthy to bear the burden, Lujan said that’s fair given other taxes, with sales tax hikes disproportionately affecting those with lower incomes. But he has conceded that having a tax hike that affects perhaps only 4% of Arizonans is more likely to be politically palatable at the polls than one that hits more.


  That, in turn, has led to dueling economic reports.


  One prepared by the Goldwater Institute says the higher top tax rate will make it harder to recruit new businesses into Arizona and result in “out- migration of high-income individuals” to states with lower taxes. Overall, its economic modeling predicts 124,000 jobs will be lost within 10 years, with a reduction of $120 million a year in state tax collections.


  It also questions whether the promised revenues will be there, saying that income tax collections on the most wealthy are the most volatile.


  But Enrique Lopezlira, an economics professor at Grand Canyon University, looks at the issue from a different perspective. That is based at least in part that, after accounting for inflation and student growth, prior cuts in education funding have resulted in the state spending less per student now than it did a decade ago.


  He predicts that restoring funds cut from public schools actually would grow the Arizona economy.


  On a deeper philosophical level, Lopezlira said the cuts in education funding were not due to the recession but instead part of an “ideological shift” to reduce investment in public education and enact tax cuts. That included a 30% reduction in corporate income tax rates.


  Prop 208 opponents argue that the initiative, in raising rates on individual income taxes, would harm small businesses.


  That’s because many are organized not as corporations, where the taxes are paid by the business at corporate tax rates, but as sole proprietorships, partnerships and under a section of the Internal Revenue Code, all of which are situations in which the business owes no taxes and all earnings are ascribed to the owner or owners. That, foes argue, makes the earnings subject to the higher taxes.


  Lujan does not dispute the point. But he noted that state income taxes are due on the net profits, after a business owner pays all costs of employees, utilities, supplies, equipment and other overhead.


  It is only what’s left as the net profits to the business owner, Lujan said, that is subject to individual income taxes. And he said any couple netting $500,000 a year after paying all the costs of their business operations probably can afford to pay some extra taxes for education.


  There’s one other point that may be of interest.


  Anything approved by the voters is protected against legislative repeal or alteration. The Arizona Constitution allows lawmakers to make changes only with a three-fourths vote and only if they “further the purpose” of the original measure.


  From Molera’s perspective, that’s a bad idea as it locks the measure — and the tax and spending plan — in place unless and until the issue goes back to voters.


  Lujan, however, sees that as a plus against legislative tinkering.

Outside of food and candles, pumpkin scents really do not make any sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

North Carolina election officials agreed Tuesday that mail-in absentee ballots returned this fall with deficient information can be fixed without forcing the voter to fill out a new blank ballot. The change, if it stands, would likely yield an upward tick in the number of counted ballots in this presidential battleground state.


  The State Board of Elections issued the new guidance to county boards explaining residents won’t be forced to start over from scratch in casting votes if a witness fails to sign or provide an address on the envelope containing their absentee ballot. The guidance means that the ballot now won’t be considered “spoiled,” and the voter will be sent an affidavit to sign to rectify the problem.


  Issues with deficient witness information on mail-in ballots have disproportionately affected Black voters. Ballots cast by African Americans account for about 43 percent of those classified as having incomplete witness information, according to state elections data. Yet Black residents account for 16 percent of overall ballots returned.


  Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who helped sue in North Carolina court to seek the changes and has worked on similar absentee ballot litigation elsewhere, praised the decision.

In an article, the LA Times spoke to a professor of psychology. He says a lot of us use travel as a way to calm anxious feelings or racing thoughts. For example, if you have a trip coming up to a tropical destination, that you've never been to before, you may try to predict what the beach will look like, plan what you'll do or even picture yourself there and that's soothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Sensitive skin can be difficult to identify. It can show up as redness, dryness, acne, sensitivity to certain products or environmental conditions, mental stress, and more. And, when our skin is reacting to something, we’re quick to try to ‘fix’ the sign with active ingredients and harsh treatments that can irritate the skin even more! More is not always more, especially when it comes to stressed skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Between changes in weather, a sharp incline in the stress we’re feeling, and harsh ingredients found in some skincare products, it is unsurprising to see that search trends for sensitive skin are skyrocketing.

The agreement with the North Carolina Alliance also says county board officials will now accept absentee ballots received through Nov. 12, as long as they were postmarked or turned in by Election Day. The previous rules had limited their receipt through Nov. 6.


  And county election boards will make it easier for people to turn in their absentee ballots or those of a relative at early in-person voting sites across the state when they open in mid-October. They won’t have to fill out a voting log, but rather an election worker will do it for them.


  “Voters deserve certainty. Our board, both Democrats and Republicans, agreed unanimously to make these commonsense changes to our process amid the COVID-19 pandemic,” Circosta said in a statement. “We have ensured that our election process is secure and accessible.”


  Republican lawmakers said the changes stand to weaken rules approved following evidence of absentee ballot fraud in a 2018 congressional race that led to a brand new election.

D. Weston Darby, Jr., 89, of Honey Brook, Chester County, a former management consultant for law firms across the country, died after a short illness on Sept. 5, 2020. He joined the Philadelphia firm of Daniel J. Cantor and Co. in the early 1960, and later owned the company that specialized in helping legal firms in managing internal problems and creating mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Darby retired in the early 1990s. He was born on April 27, 1931 and grew up at the farm “Glen Hardie” in Valley Forge, the son of the late Jean Brown Scott Darby and late Donald W. Darby. He attended the Haverford School, and graduated from the Taft School in Connecticut, and received his undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1953. He also earned a Masters in Business Administration from Temple University in 1971 and earned a certificate in advanced management from Harvard School of Business Administration in 1981. Inspired by his father, a career military man, Mr. Darby joined the U.S. Marine Corps following his graduation from Yale and received a First Lieutenant commission in December of 1954. He received his flight training with the Marines and became a Marine jet pilot in June, 1955, rising to the rank of Captain in 1958. He was serving as an Aide-de-Camp for General Rote at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina when he resigned his commission in December 1961. He was married the same month to Margarette Ann “Marge” Kortina at St. Bernards Catholic Church in his wife’s hometown of Mt. Lebanon, Pa. The couple spent the month of January on a Honeymoon touring England, Scotland and Europe. They repeated the trip in 1991 when they made the first of more than 30 trips abroad including Africa, India, and a Beijing-St. Petersburg trip on the Oriental Express. Before starting his lifetime career as a consultant, Mr. Darby worked for the Freedom Foundation in Valley Forge. He and his young wife lived first in Valley Forge, and later in Chester Springs, Pa. The family moved to Honey Brook in 1969. Mr. Darby did the all the design work and oversaw the restoration on their 18th-century stone farmhouse and continued his interest in restoring historic area homes. After his retirement, Mr. Darby was devoted to his farm and his local community, serving at one point, for several terms, on the Board of Supervisors of Honey Brook Township. He enjoyed studying military history and collected many books about the American Revolution and colonial history. He also acted on that interest and extensive knowledge by serving in leadership roles in numerous historical and hereditary organizations. Among them, the Mayflower Society, the Colonial Wars, the Colonial Society, and the Sons of the American Revolution. Mr. Darby was active with several clubs on Nantucket Island, where he and his family had a home for 40 years. He was a former member of the Nantucket Yacht Club and continued to be a longtime member of the Wharf Rat Club. The family also spent many summers on Eleuthera, an island in the Bahamas, where Mr. Darby designed and built a house and guest house. In addition to his wife of 59 years, Mr. Darby is survived by his two children, Kortny Shearer and Bruce Darby and two grandchildren. Internment will be private at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, Honey Brook, Pa.

This year, Porter, who notably celebrates his 51st birthday today, kept his look serene and subtle, styled by Beyoncé veteran Ty Hunter an all-white pantsuit by Ashi Studio. But because it was Porter, there was still requisite drama; this time via a shawl accent that flowed into a train.

Refining is an aggressively competitive margin business, where firms fight for dimes and nickels. No surprises then that margins are so low given how much spare refining capacity there is around the world. The obvious choice for refiners now is to cut crude runs and wait out the pandemic. As such, crude oil front-to-third month timespreads are not liking the refiners' wait-and-see approach. Having recovered from the lows into the summer, timespreads have rolled down since August. The truth of the matter is that refining margins have little to hold onto heading into winter. Seasonally, global diesel demand for heating typically rises by 1.5-2.0 million b/d sequentially from August to December, if the winter is normal. But if winter weather does not help and cyclical activity does not recover, distillate cracks can roll down further, pressing crude oil lower.

Brewers left-hander Brett Anderson (3-3, 4.38 ERA) makes his second start since he was scratched because of hip tightness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Forget the princess outfit, the Batman suit, or the Donald Trump mask.


  The coronavirus pandemic has put a damper on Halloween celebrations in the US this year with health officials encouraging Americans to avoid heading out for a candy-fuelled evening and to instead stay home and hold virtual parties.


  "Many traditional Halloween activities can be high-risk for spreading viruses," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that advised against crowded indoor costume parties or sending kids trick-or- treating.


  "Going to an indoor haunted house where people may be crowded together and screaming" is also off-limits, the agency said.


  Instead, Americans are being encouraged to carve pumpkins at home or with friends and neighbors outdoors while adhering to social distancing guidelines.


  Virtual Halloween costume contests are also encouraged.


  For those who can't fathom ignoring one of the most popular US holidays of the year -- during which kids go door-to-door to receive treats -- the CDC said "one-way trick-or-treating" or socially distanced parades present a moderate risk.


  It said goodie bags could be prepared in advance and placed, for example, at the end of a driveway for children to grab.


  The CDC guidelines come as states across the country are grappling with how to balance health safety and fun during the annual celebration.


  "Since some of the traditional ways in which this holiday is celebrated does not allow you to minimize contact with non-household members, it is important to plan early and identify safer alternatives," the Los Angeles County Health Department said.


  The county initially banned trick-or-treating and other Halloween activities but quickly walked back on that decision to change the wording to "not recommended."

After more than a decade of renting a storefront in historic downtown Faribault, a local family-owned business is finding success in its own building.


  Luis and Ana del Aguila moved their small store, Anadelas Novedades, to 327 Central Ave in February, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. They bought the century-old building from Paul Swenson, a well-known local photographer who was retiring.


  Prior to that, the Aguilas rented a building exactly a block down the street at 227 Central for about five years. Before that they rented a different downtown building across the street from Pawn Minnesota. The Aguilas have owned other small businesses in Faribault over the years, including the Taco Campanero Grill at 508 Central Ave. and a grocery store that occupied the building that's now home to the Cancun Grill.


  While those businesses closed, Anadelas Novedades has stayed, with the Aguilas providing check cashing and money transfer services, tax preparation and some retail with a focus on serving the area’s growing Latino community.


  Luis del Aguila, a Guatemalan immigrant and U.S. citizen, commented that over the decade that Anandelas Novedades has been in business, the number of local Latino-owned businesses has not grown substantially.


  However, he said that his business has seen a steady increase in traffic over the years. Unlike so many other downtown businesses, Anandelas Novedades, as an essential business, stayed open during the brunt of the pandemic. Even with much of the economy shuttered, Aguila managed to continue to do good business. With much of the area’s Latino community working in essential jobs, there was a continued need for check cashing and other services.


  While the check-cashing side of the business has stayed largely stable, Aguila said that most of the rest of the business has grown. In particular, he noted that the tax preparation side of the business has become particularly popular.”


  “Ten years ago we started out in a much smaller space,” he said. “But we’ve kept growing and growing, and now we’ve bought our own building.”


  Aguila said that not having to deal with a landlord has been a great help. He’s been able to collect a bit of extra income by renting up two apartments on the building’s upper floors.


  But owning a business in downtown Faribault comes with its own responsibilities. Though they haven’t reached out to Community Development Coordinator Kim Clausen yet, the Aguilas plan to get windows on the upstairs of the building fixed.


  Downtown building maintenance has long been a controversial topic at City Hall, with the city recently providing grants to businesses willing to fix their building. An historic structure like the one at 327 Central is eligible for more assistance but also subject to more restrictions.


  Faribault Area Chamber of Commerce and Tourism President Nort Johnson said that the Chamber was aware of the move and is pleased to have another successful building owner in downtown Faribault.


  “We’re glad to see they’re growing their business in our community," he said.

SWANTON, Ohio (AP) — President Donald Trump was interrupted twice during an Ohio rally this week by sign-waving supporters chanting, “Fill that seat!” “I will fill that seat,” Trump responded before launching into an extended riff on his plans to quickly nominate a successor to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “They say it’s the most important thing a president can do.” During a swing through Wisconsin a few hours earlier, there were no big crowds for Democrat Joe Biden, whose campaign is strictly following protocols to combat the coronavirus. The battle over the future of the Supreme Court was largely missing, too, with Biden far more eager to talk about the pandemic, health care and the economy. Since Ginsburg's death on Friday sparked a battle over the future of the Supreme Court, Trump and Biden have fought to define the lens through which voters view the 2020 contest. Biden wants the election to be a referendum on Trump and his failure to control a pandemic that has killed 200,000 Americans or address the nation's larger health care issues. Trump wants to focus on the court fight to unite the party and energize the GOP's base. Biden openly acknowledged his reluctance to focus on the Supreme Court during an interview with WBAY, a local Green Bay, Wisconsin, news station, when asked whether he’d support liberal proposals to add seats to the high court. “It’s a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I’m not going to answer that question — because it will shift the focus. That’s what he wants. He never wants to talk about the issue at hand, and he always tries to change the subject,” Biden said of Trump. He insisted discussion should be about why Trump “is moving in a direction that’s totally inconsistent with what...

FALMOUTH -- Members of the Falmouth Select Board have sent a letter to the Massachusetts Army National Guard asking that additional public comment be allowed on plans for a machine gun range at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod.


  Select Board members said Monday they were disappointed to hear about plans for the proposed range, which would abut the towns of Mashpee, Bourne and Sandwich as well as Falmouth. They also said the range was planned without any input from the board.


  The proposal calls for clearing 170 acres of forest and disturbing about 199 acres of land. More than 5,000 acres would be required to accommodate the operation, as it would include the area where projectiles fired on the range would land. Weapons that are expected to be used at the range include different machine guns, 12-gauge shotguns, grenade launchers and pistols.


  A 100-page environmental report prepared by the Guard says the project would not have significant environmental impacts.


  Town Manager Julian Suso sent a letter concerning the rangeto Keith Driscoll with the Massachusetts Army National Guard. The letter was dated Aug. 31 and sent on behalf of Select Board Chairwoman Megan English Braga and Vice Chairman Doug Brown.


  The letter asks that the Guard extend the public comment period on the report for an additional 30 days to allow more opportunity for public review, discussion and input. It also asks that the Guard hold a formal public presentation on the project.


  The Select Board has received numerous emails from residents raising concerns about the clear-cutting on the base and the environmental impacts of the firing range, which would be located within the Upper Cape Water Supply Reserve, according to the letter.


  "This strategic water supply reserve serves the Upper Cape Towns of Bourne, Falmouth, Mashpee and Sandwich and occupies a fundamental location within Cape Cod's sole source aquifer," the letter states.


  During the Select Board's Monday meeting, Suso said he invited a representative to join the board that night and give a presentation but said he was told by Matthew Porter of the Massachusetts Army National Guard that nobody would be available at that time. Suso said he was told by Porter that the Guard will be presenting and distributing a "robust information product" that will answer the relevant questions on the project.


  Brown said it was concerning that the planning of the project has been going on for two to three years without the Select Board's input, even though base leaders come to the board every year to give an update on what is going on at the base.


  "It's unfortunate that we have to find this out by a clip in the newspaper instead of at least a letter to us." he said.


  Brown also expressed concern that the machine gun range will move forward without much public input.


  "I find that troubling given that the base had so much already cleared space that is being unused," Brown said, "and now we're going to clear another 170 acres of deep forest, which I know it's a military reserve, but it's also a pretty important natural resource."


  Select Board member Doug Jones said he is "above being disappointed" by how the project has evolved.


  "To get this far in the process, they clearly knew the last time they came to us that they were planning it," Jones said. "I'm really quite angry that they would do this to us."


  English Braga said some residents have expressed concerns about water contamination that was caused by operations on the base.


  Firefighting foam once was used at a firefighting training area on the base and contaminants known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, seeped into groundwater plumes. Because of fuel spills and other activities that happened in the past at Camp Edwards and Otis Air National Guard Base, parts of the aquifer have been contaminated.


  Since then Joint Base Cape Cod has implemented water treatment systems to clean the water.


  "The water contamination is not gone," English Braga said. "We still have PFAS. We still have emerging contaminants. … We are still, as a community and the surrounding communities, dealing with the fallout from that contamination."


  English Braga said the board needs to have a representative from the base come to a board meeting so the public can have an opportunity to ask questions about the project.


  Brown suggested the board partner with other organizations like Sierra Club or Conservation Law Foundation and get their input.


  "It might come to the point where we might have to intervene with legal action to get a voice in this," Brown said. "I hate to say that, but it's a possibility. It's pretty far along."


  The board decided that Brown would reach out to other organizations and communities about the proposed project.

Danny Lee offered a mea culpa on Tuesday following his meltdown during the 120th U.S. Open in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
 Lee extended his apology over social media on the heels of his quintuple-bogey 9 on the 18th hole to complete the third round of the tournament. Lee accentuated his six-putt fiasco by nonchalantly paddling the ball until it went into the hole.
 Lee, 30, promptly withdrew from the tournament at Winged Foot, citing a wrist injury.
 "I apologize for my poor actions at U.S. Open last week. It was very unprofessional and foolish. obviously hurt lots of my fans and followers and my sponsors out there," Lee wrote on Twitter. .".. my frustration took over me and combined with injury I had to fight with it for all week.
 "Still it's just an excuse. I shouldn't left like that... and also like to apologize to USGA they did Tremendous job last week at Winged Foot. On the course and off the course. Now I'm going to take some time off and think about what I did and starting next time I'll show up as a better person and have better sportsmanship. Thank you."
 The horror show began innocently enough for Lee, who prepared for a 4-foot par putt before the bottom fell out.
 His first attempt rolled to the left of the hole before misfiring on his next attempt, this time from 5 feet, 7 inches away, per the U.S. Open website.
 Lee appeared to let his frustration get the better of him as he swiped at the ball from one side of the hole to the other before finally sinking a putt from 7 feet, 7 inches away.

The State Board of Elections issued the new guidance to county boards explaining residents won't be forced to start over from scratch in casting votes if a witness fails to sign or provide an address on the envelope containing their absentee ballot. The guidance means that the ballot now won't be considered “spoiled,” and the voter will be sent an affidavit to sign to rectify the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

“This is exactly why I am running for the U.S. Senate — the age of politicians who put party over people must end,” she said in an email fundraising letter. “Justice Ginsburg was a forceful advocate of women’s rights and made equality her life’s long mission. She was a role model for each of us, and carried herself with a profound sense of dignity and justice.”


  Risch passed along his condolences for Justice Ginsburg’s passing, while making it clear that he politically disagreed with her on most issues. Conservatives in Idaho may view the timing of her death as an opportunity to replace a liberal judge.


  Again, Jordan is offering a choice and making a case for Democratic control of the Senate. But can she win? Risch has dismissed this race as a mere formality — a conservative senator seeking re-election against a liberal Democrat, with an eye toward advancing a socialist agenda.


  Jordan says, not so fast.


  “This is not over by a long shot,” she says. “(Internal) polls show him severely behind President Trump. His numbers are so far below President Trump’s that he is greatly at risk. So, his overconfidence is greatly misguided … and shows how disconnected he is with the people of Idaho. It is going to be a very rude awakening.”


  Or maybe everything will turn out the way it almost always does in Idaho and we can go back into hibernation after the election.

To put this in a nutshell, interest falls and inflation rises. Going through the cost example, interest rates fall and so do the costs of loans that firms use. Firms with falling costs reflect this on prices, and thus inflation falls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

So what will happen next? We still expect the global oil market to move into a 4.9mn b/d deficit in 4Q20 on the back of the OPEC+ cuts, supporting crude prices. Yet diesel and jetfuel/kerosene make up by far the largest petroleum product group in the oil market. So crude oil prices cannot really rally until distillate demand, jet fuel included, recovers to more normal levels in the next few months. Or maybe the crude market will have to wait for summer gasoline to come back to the rescue and take it out of hibernation in March 2021. In terms of downside risks, a big second Covid-19 wave was always going to rank first, but a warm winter now ranks second given the persistent surplus in distillate fuels. In short, with a bit of OPEC's help, crude oil prices will most likely stay range-bound in the mid-$40s to year end, so we maintain our $47/bbl 4Q20 Brent forecast. But keep an eye on the weather news.

But when another young woman, Melanie (Gina Rodriguez, sensational), joins in some of their hustles, July's film comes alive. Rodriguez -- spirited, confident, sensual -- arrives like an alien into the world of the film. Her presence, and immediate connection with the Dynes' daughter, prompt Old Dolio -- already stirred by a parenting class she was forced to sit through -- to question and challenge her unconventional upbringing. A sense of human connection (so often the yearning behind July's films) begins to belatedly take root for Old Dolio. Something earnest and tender, like soap bubbles in the wall, emerges. And the whimsical, unpredictable artistry of "Kajillionaire" turns out to be no con, at all.

College football plays a big role in this state. Most Nebraskans have never undervalued that, or taken it for granted. But if COVID-19 has shown us anything, it's that college football cuts a lot deeper here.


  It hit home when Nebraska canceled its the Red-White Spring Scrimmage, hampering the mood a little of a quarantined state. No worries, they thought. The fall and a 12-game slate beginning with Purdue on Sept. 5 was still ahead of them.


  Until it wasn't.


  Nebraska football will return in October, and it will look different when it does. But the spirit will remain the same.


  Fans will shoot the breeze over coffee on Monday mornings, discussing the walk-on who looked good on special teams. They will don red on Saturday, because they'll tell you it's the only option. They'll plan weddings and hunting trips for another day. They'll yearn for the taste of a Runza on a cold day at Memorial Stadium. They'll wish for just one shot at Ohio State at the Big Ten title game in Indy.

While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle's cost. Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh).

Nagy openly admitted that Trubisky's psyche isn't where the Bears need it to be, with the quarterback's mental tension contributing to happy feet and poor decisions.


  "His confidence isn't at an all-time high," Nagy said. "We're struggling right now. ... But how do you get that back? You get it back by practicing hard, by actually getting tighter. That's the message we've had is 'get tighter.' Believe in one another. Keep trusting."


  Trubisky continues to take coaching and constructive criticism behind the scenes and has appreciated the way Nagy has backed him through the struggles of the first two months.


  "Nagy's always got my back no matter what," Trubisky said. "It's just me and him with this offense, and we've got each other's back. And we have to continue to remind each other of that because people are going to continue to try and break us apart, saying we're not doing this and we're not doing that.


  "The fact of the matter is this is our team, our family. He's the head coach. We can do it however we want, but the fact that we have each other's backs and we're going to do it our way, it gives me a lot of confidence.

This domestic cup tie was also an exercise in squad culling for Solskjaer. As if any additional confirmation was needed, Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo and Andreas Pereira might have appeared for the club for the last time. Jesse Lingard was given a pass in spite of fluttering his eyelashes at Jose Mourinho, unmoved by his former player's flirtation. Lingard's commitment on the pitch, at least, was apparent in a tireless run-out that was only missing a goal.


  United officially confirmed unused substituteTeden Mengi's first-team promotion ahead of kick-off and the 18-year-old with nine minutes of career football to his name is already fifth-choice centre half. United hope Smalling and Rojo, training in their own 'outgoings' bubble at Carrington, are no longer on the books in a fortnight and Phil Jones, injured or not, is an irrelevance.


  Harry Maguire, a starter in 61 games for club and country in 2020-21, could not get a breather against Luton after another meek performance from Victor Lindelof at the weekend and this felt like a trial for a Maguire-Eric Bailly axis. Bailly emerged with a clean sheet and time will tell if Solskjaer abandons his Scandinavian solidarity with Lindelof at Brighton.


  Judge and Richard Arnold evaded Patrice Evra's cross-hairs to take their seats among the handful of United dignitaries in a decrepit ground advertising Barry Bolton Windows. If the United supporters were permitted entry, those who were last at Luton in 1992 would have been unable to discern any changes to one of the more archaic homes in the Football League.

“We gave our Barbies a jacuzzi bath tub by holding them in toilet water and flushing it,” she remembered.


  And plot twists were sometimes necessary.


  “We put Barbie in a tissue box and threw her up in the air,” Meyers said. “Barbie died in the crash so our new Barbie could marry Ken.”


  After laughing through another visit in 1990, the friends hugged goodbye. Beverly unexpectedly died a few days later.


  “It destroyed my joy to lose Beverly,” Meyers said. “Thinking about Barbie only made me think of Beverly’s death. My childhood died with my friend.”


  Six years later, something caught Meyers eye as she scrolled on the internet. It was a vintage Barbie outfit — the exact one she and Beverly had for their Barbies.


  Meyers purchased it, and she said what happened next is still difficult to explain.


  “I can’t describe what pain was lifted from my shoulders,” she said of the day the Barbie item arrived. “When I was able to hold a piece of our shared childhood memory it released the depression and grief.”


  Meyers attends Barbie conventions, enjoys new friendships there and changes Barbie clothing with Beverly in mind.


  “May her death be eternal,” Meyers said.“Beverly’s memory is now eternal and not sad.”


  And when she’s missing her friend, she has her collection of Barbies to help her remember the good times.

  “We just felt with the players not playing as much and all the schedules being up in the air that it was just nice to do that and give you a bit more options and what you might do going forward next year,” Matthew said.

Enola, who tries not to think too much about the significance of the fact that her name backwards spells "Alone," is clever and spirited and wholly isolated from the world and the social mores of Victorian-era England. She and her mother (a lovely Helena Bonham-Carter) who are fiercely independent except from each other, use their stately mansion as a playground. They practice archery and tennis indoors, blow things up in the name of science, read books and generally don't seem all that concerned with the upkeep of anything but their minds.


  So it comes as a shock when Enola wakes up one morning to find her mother gone. Even more disconcerting is when her brothers Sherlock (a probably too buff Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin) return to take care of her and the estate, they don't recognize her. The grown men are also horrified that their little sister is so rough around the edges — no hat, no gloves, no worries about manners or decorum — and decide that she must be sent to finishing school.


  Naturally, Enola is not excited about the prospect of finding a husband or fitting into society and instead sneaks off to try to track down her mother instead. On her journey she becomes entangled in the life of a fellow runaway, The Viscount Tewskbury, Marquess of Basilwether (Louis Partridge), who becomes her first client.


  Brown is a natural star and seems to be having a lot of fun with Enola and getting to do something a little more carefree than portraying the trauma stricken Eleven. And besides a gnarly head injury late in the film, "Enola Holmes" is an all-ages endeavor.

Virginia lawmakers on Tuesday killed legislation that called for eliminating mandatory jail time for assaulting a police officer, a bill that drew heated opposition from Republicans who said it would send the wrong message at a time when law enforcement has come under attack during nationwide protests over police brutality and racial injustice.


  The bill proposed by Democratic Sen. Scott Surovell passed the Senate last month, but was rejected Tuesday after several Democrats on the House Courts of Justice Committee raised concerns about how certain terms were defined in the bill and whether juveniles should be exempted from the charge.


  The bill would have kept the charge as a felony, but would have given a judge or jury discretion to reduce it to a misdemeanor if there was no bodily injury to the officer or if someone’s culpability was minimal because of diminished physical or mental capacity or a developmental disorder.


  The legislation also would have required an investigation by a different police officer and approval by a prosecutor if charged as a felony.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan bill aimed at keeping goods out of the U.S. that are made with the forced labor of detained ethnic minorities in China passed overwhelmingly Tuesday in the House of Representatives despite concerns about the potential effects on global commerce.
 The House voted 406-3 to declare that any goods produced in the vast Xinjiang region of northwestern China are presumptively made with the forced labor of detained Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, and therefore banned from being imported to the U.S.
 If enacted into law, it could have significant ripple effects in global trade by forcing companies to avoid a region that products 80% of the cotton in China, one of the world's top producers of the fiber, as well as tomatoes and manufactured goods.
 Members of Congress say the measure is needed to press China to stop a campaign that has resulted in the detention of more than 1 million Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups under brutal conditions.
 “If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interest we lose all moral authority to speak about human rights anywhere in the world,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in defending the bill on the House floor.
 The bill was authored by Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, and had dozens of co-sponsors from both parties. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.

The House speaker remains one of the most powerful political posts in state government. The speaker has the ability to block or move legislation, in addition to helping determine how the state spends billions of dollars earmarked for health care, education, criminal justice and other government programs.


  Cupp takes control of the House during an unprecedented moment of division and tribulation for the presidential battleground state, and therefore the nation, less than two months from Election Day. His predecessor, fellow GOP state Rep. Larry Householder, was indicted this summer on federal bribery charges in what prosecutors called the 'largest bribery, money-laundering scheme' in state history.


  Cupp, a 69-year-old anti-abortion, pro-gun rights conservative, took Householder's seat by one vote in the GOP-controlled House, with every single Democrat and a few Republicans voting against him. All the other candidates to replace Householder were also white, Republican men.


  Following Cupp's election, colleagues and supporters of him joined in an unofficial campaign, nominating him as "the last Boy Scout" in Ohio politics. He was praised as "an elder statesman," as "studious and diligent" and as having "unimpeachable character."


  Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost shared anecdotes about Cupp's dedication to growing his own heirloom tomatoes in February so that he can enjoy them come June. His wife Libby, a retired educator, whom he met while attending a convention for College Republicans, showed photos of the three llamas they rescued, Lima (LEE'-mah) the Llama from Lima (LYE'-muh) — the Ohio city of which Cupp is a native — Mocha Latte and Phantom of the Opera, to reporters and members on the House floor.


  Even Cupp himself has added to the narrative of his simple life and how it won't change with the promotion.


  "My wife will still make me take the garbage out every Sunday night. Clean out the cat litter boxes and those kinds of things," Cupp told reporters upon being elected speaker. "I tell people if they think I'm more than I am, they should tell me because I don't want to be."


  But there are other views of Cupp — including from an old opponent, former Democratic Justice William O'Neill, who alleged years ago that Cupp violated his post's ethics in accepting campaign contributions from the same energy company that is now at the center of the federal investigation into his predecessor.


  Householder and his four associates are accused of spending the money to boost themselves politically and personally, to stage often nasty campaigns to elect Householder loyalists, to buy votes for the bailout bill and to poison subsequent efforts to repeal it. All five men have pleaded not guilty.


  The federal investigation of the second Ohio House speaker in two years threw the already divided chamber into further disarray.


  But Cupp faces more than just an internal rift within his party and chamber. The new speaker comes in amid a pandemic that has left more than 4,000 Ohioans dead and hundreds of thousands unemployed across the state. There are tensions between and within the two parties around mail-in voting and ballot box access ahead of the election as gun violence challenges the state's major cities.


  When asked why he accepted the nomination this time around, Cupp said this was part of the plan to "get the House back."

President Donald Trump was interrupted twice during an Ohio rally this week by sign-waving supporters chanting, “Fill that seat!”


  “I will fill that seat,” Trump responded before launching into an extended riff on his plans to quickly nominate a successor to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “They say it’s the most important thing a president can do.”


  During a swing through Wisconsin a few hours earlier, there were no big crowds for Democrat Joe Biden, whose campaign is strictly following protocols to combat the coronavirus. The battle over the future of the Supreme Court was largely missing, too, with Biden far more eager to talk about the pandemic, health care and the economy.


  Since Ginsburg’s death on Friday sparked a battle over the future of the Supreme Court, Trump and Biden have fought to define the lens through which voters view the 2020 contest. Biden wants the election to be a referendum on Trump and his failure to control a pandemic that has killed 200,000 Americans or address the nation’s larger health care issues. Trump wants to focus on the court fight to unite the party and energize the GOP’s base.

This is the second major update Priestley has provided since Doherty revealed her diagnosis. He said in February that he had reached out to his former co- star after she went public with the news. Priestley explained at the time that he was one of the many people sending well-wishes to Doherty.


  "I reached out to her yesterday when the news broke," Priestley said in February. "She's overwhelmed with well-wishers and with people reaching out to her. I haven't heard back from her yet, but I'm sure that I will very soon. Shannen was a big part of my life. Shannen and I will always have a bond that is very meaningful. I'm very heartbroken about the news and I wish her and her family the best in this very difficult time."


  While Doherty previously had kept her diagnosis secret, it was set to ultimately surface via court documents. She had a lawsuit against State Farm concerning damages to her home by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. Doherty later explained that she wanted to provide the information prior to the documents do so first.

  "I'd rather people hear it from me," she said. "I don't want it to be twisted; I don't want it to be a court document. I want it to be real and authentic and I want to control the narrative. I want people to know from me."


  Doherty has faced stage four cancer at home while remaining in isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, she has provided updates about her life and called for people to be safe. One example was a video showing a series of matches lighting up before one match stepped out of line and stopped and flame's spread. She used the video to illustrate how it is important to stay at home in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

The Prince William and Manassas Democratic committees are asking Democrats to vote “no” on “Constitutional Amendment 1,” while the local Republican committee is encouraging voters to vote "yes."


  The amendment, which will be on ballots in November, aims to address Virginia’s history of political gerrymandering by creating an independent redistricting commission.


  If the amendment is approved by voters, it will create a 16-member, bipartisan commission comprised of eight legislators from both parties and eight citizen appointees to redraw Virginia’s congressional and state legislative maps – a process that occurs once every 10 years following the U.S. Census.


  The commission must create a map that receives the approval of at least 12 of its members before it would be sent to the Virginia General Assembly for a vote. If the commission can’t agree on a map, the Supreme Court of Virginia would be tasked with drawing the districts.


  The amendment will also open the redistricting process by allowing the public to view commission meetings and participate in mandatory public hearings.


  The U.S. Supreme Court struck down Virginia’s 2011 legislative map and ordered the state redraw 11 gerrymandered House of Delegates districts. The court found that the Virginia General Assembly had unfairly crammed Black voters into those 11 districts, a process known as “racial gerrymandering.”


  Prince William County Democratic Committee Chair Collin Robinson said the local committee opposes the constitutional amendment because it still allows politicians to take part in the redistricting process, making it a bipartisan – but not fully independent – commission.


  “I don’t find a commission that has eight politicians out of 16 seats to be a very effective group for getting politics out of gerrymandering,” Robinson said.


  Robinson added that the Prince William County Democratic committee supports ending gerrymandering, but said, “We want it done right.”


  Prince William County Republican Committee Chair Tim Parrish said the local GOP is guiding voters “to vote ‘yes’ on amendment one.” Parrish said the party supports the proposed constitutional amendment in part because it will increase transparency over the redistricting process and include citizen input.


  “Having this done in a more public way is absolutely a good thing. I think that including members of the public alongside elected officials is going to make the process much more effective and certainly much more efficient,” Parrish said.


  In Fauquier County, the local Democratic Committee has not taken a position on whether local Democrats should vote for or against “Constitutional Amendment 1.” Instead, committee Chair Max Hall said the local Democratic committee is taking time to “educate voters on the amendment.”


  Hall said there are some issues with the proposed commission because it doesn’t completely eliminate politics from the redistricting process. But he said that giving voters information about the referendum will let them “make an educated choice.”


  The Fauquier Republican Committee is telling voters to vote “yes” on the Constitutional amendment. Committee Chair Greg Schumacher said Monday that “both parties have [gerrymandered], and it’s time to have a bipartisan, non- partisan redistricting commission.”


  Schumacher said the commission “will be as free as possible from partisan redistricting from either side and gerrymandering.”


  The constitutional amendment had to pass the House of Delegates two years in a row, with an election in between, to be placed on the ballot. But many of the state’s Democratic lawmakers who initially voted in favor of the amendment now oppose it, with some saying it will enshrine partisan gerrymandering into the Virginia Constitution.


  The amendment garnered near unanimous support from Democrats the first time it passed in 2019, when Democrats were in the minority. The second time it passed, in 2020, Democrats had a majority in both chambers – and all but a handful of delegates flipped their votes.


  Republican lawmakers have criticized members of the Democratic party for flip-flopping on redistricting reform after supporting it while in the minority.


  Del. Kirk Cox, R-66th, who is mulling a run for governor in 2021, said on Twitter Monday: “Don't be distracted by those who once supported independent redistricting, but now don't. Wonder why they're having a change of heart?”

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — There are no dodgeball games, cookouts or other rushing events at Virginia Commonwealth University’s campus in Richmond, but fraternities and sororities are still recruiting new brothers and sisters. The Greek chapters at VCU, and many other Virginia schools, are using Zoom to recruit new members. Some fraternities and sororities believe the challenge of social distancing has strengthened bonds amongst each other as well as their philanthropy efforts. “Not being able to meet in-person this semester as a whole chapter has been hard, but it has given us more time to focus on our priorities,” said John Rudolph, VCU Pi Kappa Alpha recruitment chair. “Those being our grades, community service and philanthropy.” VCU’s fraternities and sororities have given around 8,400 hours of time to charities in the last academic year, said LaDarius Thompson, associate director of Civic Engagement and Fraternity and Sorority Life at VCU.

Zottig has directed a few plays in the Snack-Size series.


  “Myself and other staff members who typically work behind the scenes have had the opportunity to direct.


  Some members have learned new skills such as video editing, and others have been encouraged to step up into new leadership positions,” Zottig said.


  Nathaniel Niemi, resident director at The Studio, said the short length means a lot is crammed into each of the plays, each requiring specific aesthetics and style choices.


  “There are a whole bunch of fun genres,” Niemi said. “We get to play with a bunch of styles and genres that we normally don’t.”


  Niemi said some of these plays “are wacky and silly.”


  “One that I directed was just a list of opinions that we turned into a mock- commercial,” he said.


  Niemi is also directing The Studio’s first crack at puppetry.


  “(That will be) super-fun,” he said.


  Morse hopes the plays give patrons the chance to take a break from whatever they are doing, or whatever is occupying their head space, and escape into a little bit of theater.


  “Each one will be very different, so if you don’t like it one week, you might love it the next,” Morse said.

One billion dollars of the budget will go directly to the development of a commercial human lunar system that will take humans to the moon's surface, NASA said.


  An allotment of $651 million will be used to support the Orion Spacecraft and the rocket that Boeing is building for the moon mission -- called the Space Launch System or SLS. NASA has already spent at least $11.9 billion on the SLS, which was supposed to be ready by December 2017.


  The spacecraft is complete, NASA said, and the core stage and four attached rockets are undergoing final tests in preparation for a "critical hot fire test this fall."


  NASA's Artemis I mission is on track to launch in 2021 with two test flights around the Moon without astronauts. However, NASA plans to send robots using commercial delivery services to "send dozens of new science investigations and technology demonstrations" to the Moon twice in 2021.


  Artemis II is set to launch in 2023 with astronauts on board in preparation to have Artemis III bring astronauts back to the surface of the Moon.


  The astronauts will be fitted with modern spacesuits that allow for greater flexibility and movement than the spacesuits used by other Apollo-era astronauts, and they will be tasked with collecting samples and conducting a "range of science experiments over the course of nearly seven days."


  The Artemis program will search for and potentially extract resources such as water that can be converted into other usable resources such as oxygen and fuel, and NASA hopes to develop new mobility capabilities that will allow astronauts to explore new regions of the Moon.

  A tree was planted in the middle of the park close to the basketball courts with a plaque at the foot of the tree that had a portrait of Johnson engraved on it with his name.


  “The city council immediately wanted to do something special for Bobby Johnson,” said Madisonville Mayor Kevin Cotton. “Bobby Johnson was always one of those people that could walk into a room and make it a better place. His spirit could calm tension, raise camaraderie, build bridges and mend fences. No matter what season of life he was enjoying, he seemed to always enjoy life. He put his family and community first, and his heart was truly that of a servant leadership. His legacy will live on in this community. My hope is that we will all rise up to meet his expectations.”

While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle's cost. Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

But when I woke up to the news that someone, or a group of people, went out after dark to cut out and vandalize my re-election signs throughout Sierra Vista, I couldn’t help but feel disappointed about how far bitter partisanship has gone.


  In my years of public service, I have experienced my fair share of criticism. But I have never seen so many personal and aggressive attacks on candidates as I have in this cycle.


  Of course, I don’t know for sure to say who the perpetrator is in regard to my signs — but I do know that whoever did this has aggression and division in his or her heart. I would never, and will never, condone this kind of behavior against my opponent. Against anyone. It is not ‘law and order,’ and it goes against our very values. Hate stifles progress, creates dangerous tribalism, and unnecessarily divides us. In a time of nationwide suffering, we need healing, not more hardship.


  There’s something about living or growing up in rural Arizona. I think it makes people a special kind of tough. It made me resilient, and it taught me that my family members that vote differently than me — they aren’t the enemy. My opponents for public office — they aren’t the enemy, either. The enemy isn’t the other political party. The enemy is the hate that has been brought into politics.


  We are at a crossroads. This militant behavior will only get worse if we don’t act to change our course. We need to decide between continuing down this slippery slope of hatred and division or doing everything in our power to condemn acts like these and regain sight of the country we all know and love.


  I hope everyone joins me in choosing the latter.

What does insulin do?


  Insulin controls the amount of sugar in your blood by regulating the conversion of glucose into energy, or storage in the liver for future use.


  When you eat, your body takes in glucose from food, and your blood sugar levels rise. This triggers the release of insulin in healthy individuals. The insulin signals your cells to absorb glucose and use it as energy, which reduces your blood sugar.

Iowa State knows all too well about picking up the pieces after a heartbreaking loss and getting in the right frame of mind for the next game.


  The Cyclones are calling on that experience again heading into their Big 12 opener at TCU on Saturday following their home loss to double-digit underdog Louisiana-Lafayette on Sept. 12.


  “Obviously we don’t want to be in situations where we have to bounce back after a hard loss,” junior linebacker Mike Rose said Tuesday, “but these past couple years we’ve been in these exact situations. We’ve bounced back before, so we need to have that same attitude of having to go back to work and bouncing back like we have in the past.”


  The 31-14 loss to the Ragin’ Cajuns of the Sun Belt Conference was crushing. It knocked the Cyclones out of the Top 25 and put a damper on the excitement surrounding the team. Iowa State was a trendy pick to make it to the Big 12 championship game for the first time.

Newbuilding orders for dry bulk carriers seem to be on the up. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Allied Shipbroking said that “it was an interesting week in the newbuilding front, with news over a fair number of fresh orders emerging especially in the dry bulk sector. It has certainly been a positive period for the dry bulk market, with buyers’ sentiment having improved significantly during the last couple of months due to the resilience of freight rates, which has shaped a promising outlook for the coming quarters. Last week, we noted newbuilding activity being focused between the Capesize and Supramax sectors, with the majority of buyers being located in the Far East. On the tanker front, activity was less impressive last week with the orders for only 4 MRs coming into the light. Interest in the crude oil tanker market has remained minimal for now, with few new orders being seen. The uninspiring freight market and the poor fundamentals in the segment has curbed appetite and it is not expected to turn around anytime soon. The gradual decrease in newbuilding prices has yet to entice any considerable increase in buying appetite for the time being, while it looks as though this will continue to be the case for the coming months.

"We have to go out there and be ourselves," Mills said. "The biggest thing that me being here, this being my fifth year, we've always faced adversity and the way that we've handled that was having nobody do anything uncharacteristic and just being ourselves and playing our type of football. That's the perfect solution."
 The Rams exposed many problems plaguing the Eagles defense, including their inability to adjust on the fly against bootlegs, play actions and misdirections.
 "This is a copycat league," Mills said. "Offenses are gonna run what they're gonna run — their bread-and-butter plays. But we have to know that we are going to get attacked until we stop it a couple times from each team in each game that we play."
 Another problem for the defense right now is their inability to prevent teams from scoring in the red zone. Opposing offenses have converted 7 of 9 opportunities in those situations.
 "We've just got to play better. That's one of the things that we pride ourselves on as a defense — if they don't score, they don't win," Mills said. "If there is a situation where they do get down there (in the red zone), we at least want to have them make a field goal and that's it. So, I just think that's the biggest thing."
 Mills said that Schwartz is too hard on himself and shouldn't be the one to blame for the defense underperforming.
 "I have a lot of respect for Schwartz, you don't see a lot of defensive coordinators come out and saying those types of things, putting everything on the line for himself," Mills said. "But also, coaches coach and players play. We have to have his back, too, regardless if he felt like he gave us a good game plan or not. We still have to go out and execute whatever the play is called and play to the highest standard. If he felt like he didn't put us in a good situation, we have to back him up, just like he backs us up."

 No. 1 draft pick Joe Burrow and the Bengals visit the Linc Sunday. Mills, a fellow LSU grad, loves what he sees from the rookie quarterback, who threw for 316 yards and three touchdowns in a Week 2 loss at Cleveland.
 "The biggest thing you see from him is the progression," Mills see. "You see him at the line making checks and that's very, very impressive. Also his pocket awareness, he's moving out of simple sacks that you see (from) younger quarterbacks who are not moving their feet or they don't have that awareness where guys are grabbing them and putting them to the ground. So, the biggest thing for me watching him on film is his pocket awareness and actually making checks at the line of scrimmage."

It's a fine start but if "Kajillionaire" remained in the Dynes' weird and warped bubble, the quirkiness would surely grow a little tiresome. But when another young woman, Melanie (Gina Rodriguez, sensational), joins in some of their hustles, July's film comes alive. Rodriguez -- spirited, confident, sensual -- arrives like an alien into the world of the film. Her presence, and immediate connection with the Dynes' daughter, prompt Old Dolio -- already stirred by a parenting class she was forced to sit through -- to question and challenge her unconventional upbringing. A sense of human connection (so often the yearning behind July's films) begins to belatedly take root for Old Dolio. Something earnest and tender, like soap bubbles in the wall, emerges. And the whimsical, unpredictable artistry of "Kajillionaire" turns out to be no con, at all.

After the death of George Floyd, anti-police sentiment seems to have reached a fever pitch among Democrats. Activists and candidates called for the defunding of police, antifa and Black Lives Matter rioters tried to burn down buildings with law enforcement inside, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to federal officers as "stormtroopers."

But Sproul's work for the West campaign -- and his long track record of working for Republicans -- lends credence to the notion that the West campaign is working to siphon votes from Democratic nominee Joe Biden and boost President Donald Trump's chances of reelection. West's campaign, which has been bolstered by Republican operatives nationwide, isn't holding events or hammering home an agenda with voters. Instead, it appears solely focused on getting on the ballot in as many states as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Under the voting system, voters are allowed to rank all candidates on the ballot. If no one wins a majority of first-place votes, then there are additional tabulations, aided by computers, in which last-place finishers are eliminated and votes reallocated based on those supporters’ second-place choices. Transporting the ballots to Augusta for additional tabulations delays results for about a week.

The Kenyon-Wanamingo Music Department has been selected as a featured performer for the Minnesota Music Educators Association (MMEA) Midwinter Conference in February 2021.


  Band Director Claire Larson and Choir Director Stephanie Schumacher state this is the stage that showcases the best vocal and instrumental music programs in the state.


  Typically, the state-wide conference for music educators is held for three days in February at the Minneapolis Convention Center. However, this year the conference will be held virtually.


  Instead of performing live for an audience, K-W’s band, choir and general music students will be showcased in a virtual format.


  Larson and Schumacher said the K-W Music Department has been built upon the foundation of K-12 music collaboration. Together, they embrace the development of the whole student and encourage student involvement in the comprehensive school experience.


  “We strive to be a ‘model’ rural school district providing students with state of the art music technology, opportunities for enrichment through guest musicians and music residencies,” added Larson and Schumacher in the release.


  Since students involved are also active members in a multitude of school organizations including; knowledge bowl, math team, student council, FFA, National Honors Society, FCCLA, theatre, speech and sports, Larson and Schumacher believe K-W’s music program is unique. They both encourage and support students across all various organizations, and see students as hardworking young people with a strong sense of purpose.


  Larson and Schumacher are also grateful for the outpouring support from Kenyon and Wanamingo communities, and they say they look forward to showcasing their music program at the state level.


  “The music department is planning a collage of performances, interviews and a first person account of the life and vibrancy of our music program and how it is deeply rooted in community history and traditions,” Larson and Schumacher said in the release.

A Senate vote to reject a Republican nominee, in which Republican senators cast the decisive votes, would demoralize and divide the party on election eve and betray a cause for which some have fought for 50 years. It is hard to conceive of a greater act of political treason.      Many Republican presidents made strides toward recapturing the court after the radical rampage of the Earl Warren era. None achieved it. Three of Richard Nixon's four picks went south on Roe v. Wade, and Justice Harry Blackmun authored the abominable decision.      Gerald Ford's lone nominee, Justice John Paul Stevens, went left as soon as he went up. While Ronald Reagan nominated Antonin Scalia, his other choices, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, became "swing votes." George H. W. Bush picked David Souter and Clarence Thomas, with the latter's constitutionalism canceled out by the former's liberalism.      But today, the hour of Trump's triumph may be at hand, and the stark panic on the left testifies to it.      Mobs are forming outside McConnell's home in Kentucky. Former Attorney General Eric Holder threatens that if Republicans confirm a justice this year, a Democratic Senate will cancel out its victory by "packing" the courts. Rep. Joe Kennedy III says that if McConnell prevails in 2020, "We pack the court in 2021." Radicals are threatening to take to the streets and burn the country down if a Trump nominee is elevated.     Let them try.      When FDR, after his landslide reelection, sought to pack the court by increasing the number of justices in 1937, the result was a national recoil and a political rout that cost him 72 House seats in 1938.      Republican senators have to bite the bullet on this one and vote on whomever Trump nominates before this session of Congress ends.      And, in this battle, there is no room for conscientious objectors.      Even "Never Trumpers" and Republicans for Biden have to take a stand. For if they play a role in killing Trump's nominee, and Biden wins in November, they will have helped to turn the Supreme Court over to leftist Democrats who will fill both the Ginsburg seat and that of Justice Stephen Breyer, 82, and hold the court for years.

  “We can only cite them if we do see it,” she said. “We have to visually confirm. We do follow up on every call we receive.”


  Beach said the proper wearing of masks in businesses will stop the citations.


  “We don’t want to give citations,” she said. “We just want people to wear their mask and we are required to do that. If everybody would just put their masks on and wear them, there wouldn’t be any issues at all. When you wear your mask you are showing empathy and concern for everyone else around you.”

Boys & Girls Clubs of Oceanside was chosen as a California Nonprofit of the Year by 76th District Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. The club is one of more than 100 nonprofits honored by their state senators and Assembly members for supporting the communities they serve.


  The club was recognized for its efforts to support area youths, especially recently during the pandemic. The club started an emergency food program, ran summer learning enrichment camps following health mandates and started a Back2School program that gives learning support to at-risk youths while schools are closed.


  “During these unprecedented times, BGCO staff have worked around the clock to ensure that at-risk youth have the support they need while school closures continue,” said Jodi Diamond, the club’s CEO.


  The club started the emergency food program in early May to help families in need and since then has served more than 26,000 meals, prepared by the club’s culinary arts specialists. The meals are given out weekdays through curbside pickup and include a healthy lunch and snack. Youths attending the club’s Back2School camp receive a daily lunch and snack on-site.

They achieve that as well by denying quorums. Before the Senate can do anything, legislation, amendment, nominations, there has to be a quorum of a simple majority—51 votes. Democrats can make 51 of the 53 Republicans have to be on hand. Every. Single. Day. They can make Republicans be in the Senate chamber and having to stay there, keeping them from raising money with phone calls and fundraisers. Senate Democrats, as long as they have the one person there to deny UC requests, can spend their time on their reelections. The fun thing is, Democrats can also suggest the absence of a quorum as many times a day as they feel like, and then sometimes show up for quorum calls, and sometimes not. If they suggest the absence of a quorum and then Republicans can't round up the 51 senators at a time they need to have one, they have to adjourn. The Senate doesn't continue work that day.
