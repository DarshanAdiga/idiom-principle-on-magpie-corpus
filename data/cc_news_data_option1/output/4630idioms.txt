Pfizer also boosted hopes this week, saying early data suggests its vaccine is 90% effective. But the good news came in one of the grimmest weeks of the pandemic so far. Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are surging across the U.S. — and turning up the pressure to get the vaccine effort right.
 In Philadelphia, the health department is counting how many health care workers and others would be among the first in line. In Louisiana, officials are planning a remote exercise this week to play out different scenarios exploring how the process might unfold.
 "If you get 10,000 doses, what are you going to do, versus 100,000 doses?" said Dr. Frank Welch, director of Louisiana's immunization program.
 State and local officials are also planning for the likelihood that the first shipments will not be enough to cover everyone in high-priority groups.
 Similar preparations are happening at the federal level. Welch listened in last week on a "war gaming" session by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
 For the vaccination effort to get off the ground, state officials have been readying systems to track supplies and who has been vaccinated. That information will be fed into a national network and will be critical in giving federal health officials an up-to-date picture of vaccinations around the country.
 Providers such as pharmacies and doctors' offices will also need to be able to look up records, so people do not have to return to the same place for their second shot. More than one vaccine could also become available, and doses cannot be mixed and matched.
 "We not only have to bring people back for a second dose, but need to make sure that we have very good records of which vaccine they received the first time," said Dr. Jinlene Chan of Maryland's health department.
 States already have immunization registries, which will be used for COVID-19.
 To better understand whether at-risk groups are getting vaccinated, the CDC wanted providers to report the race and ethnicity of the people they vaccinate. But pharmacies and other providers that do not always collect that information objected.
 "We have to be careful not to put too many administrative burdens on providers that are already stressed," said Mitchel Rothholz of the American Pharmacists Association, an industry group.
 He said providers have been told they will have the option to leave that information out.
 Providers will also have to report vaccination information daily, which will be an adjustment for those that typically enter data weekly or every couple of weeks, state officials said.
 To help people find doses in their area, the CDC wants to put information on a vaccine finder website, which will be updated each day with the latest inventory.
 Supplying that inventory information might be a staffing strain for some providers, including a hospital in Utah that said it only has one person who currently enters the information, said Jon Reid, who manages the state's immunization registry.
 "And they don't do it every day. They do it whenever," Reid said. State officials in Utah plan to update the inventory, rather than ask each provider to enter it, he said.

Analysts are still largely optimistic the market can climb even higher, largely because they see a potential vaccine as a game changer. Despite the declines, the S&P 500 and Dow are both close to their record highs. But several risks remain that could trip up markets in the near term. Rising above them all is the continuing pandemic, with daily counts climbing in nearly every state.


  The trends are worsening enough in New York, for example, that the state is ordering restaurants, bars and gyms to close at 10 p.m. each night, beginning Friday. New York had been a hotbed for the virus early in the year but had seemed to have gotten it largely under control. In Europe, several governments have brought back even tougher restrictions that will likely restrain the economy.


  "From a health standpoint and economic standpoint, the very near term looks relatively bleak," said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist with BMO Global Asset Management.


  But while he says more volatility may hit the market in the near term as governments bring back restrictions, he's still optimistic about its prospects into next year.


  "If you think back to the dark days of March, you didn't know how far we were from normalization," he said. "People were saying it may be years. But the backdrop from a markets standpoint is just a lot different than it was in March."


  Beyond the vaccines in development, which could get everyday life closer to normal, he cited the Federal Reserve, which has already shown it can roll out bond-buying programs swiftly to support markets.


  Thursday's slip for the S&P 500 pares its gain for November down to 8.2%. If it holds there, it would still be the best month for the benchmark index since April, when the market was first exploding out of the crater created by the market's sell-off amid pandemic panic.


  Declines in Big Tech stocks, which have held out well throughout much of the pandemic, helped pull the market lower. Microsoft and Facebook each slipped 0.5%.

Control of the Senate remains up in the air, and the outcome could have a profound effect on whatever shape another stimulus bill takes. As of this week, the Democrats appear to have 48 seats and the Republicans 50. Georgia's two seats have yet to be filled, given a unique rule in that state requiring candidates to win a majority of the votes. No candidate in either race reached that threshold, sending each election to a runoff in early January. If Republicans win either race, the Senate will remain under their control. If Democrats win both races, the Senate will revert to their control, given that the Vice President casts the deciding vote in a tie.

States are also working to expand the number of pharmacies, doctors' offices and other providers that can administer COVID-19 vaccines, to ensure shots are conveniently available.
 But enrollment can be time-consuming, Reid said, because providers often need help filling out forms, getting technical systems working and going through inspections to ensure they can meet storage requirements. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F).
 Given the hurdles, Reid does not expect smaller pharmacies to become COVID-19 vaccine providers.
 Because of the likely need for two doses given three or four weeks apart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering ways of helping Americans remember the second shot, including issuing cards that people would get with their first shot, akin to the polio immunization cards many older Americans remember carrying.
 Many people will likely need additional prodding.
 In a rural part of South Carolina, one community health center is planning multiple reminders, including text messages and calls from health workers.
 Still, "there will still be some that slip through the cracks," said Ann Lewis, CEO of CareSouth Carolina, which runs the health centers.
 Distributing doses is another issue. The Pfizer vaccine, which could be the first to get the green light, comes in shipments of nearly 1,000 doses.
 "A minimum of 1,000 doses makes it very difficult to get smaller facilities vaccinated," said Rich Lakin, director of Utah's immunization program.
 Shipments might go to a hospital that is easily accessible to health care workers from multiple sites, Lakin said.
 "They may have to drive to that hospital to get the vaccine," he said.
 In North Dakota, providers receiving fewer than 1,000 doses will have them shipped to a state warehouse that can maintain the ultra-cold storage.
 "We'll break them down into the smaller quantities and then drive them to the provider," said Molly Howell, the state's immunization director.
 State and local health departments will break up and redistribute shipments of other vaccines, which are expected to require orders of at least 100 doses, for smaller providers that do not need that many. But even if distribution goes smoothly, officials worry people will not want the shots.
 "If there's going to be any real challenge, to be honest with you, it's going to be convincing folks to get the vaccine," said Patrick Peer, who runs the Good Neighbor Community Health Center in Columbus, Nebraska.
 So far, states have received far less money than they say they need for vaccine distribution, and it's unclear if any more federal help is coming. Public health groups estimate that an additional $8.4 billion is needed to pay for staff, data systems and outreach and supply costs.
 In rural Minnesota this fall, masked nurses in traffic vests reached into cars to give passengers flu shots. The drive-thru clinic was a way to social distance in the pandemic, but it also served as a test run for someday administering a COVID-19 vaccine.
 Carlton County has purchased mobile vaccination stations to prepare for similar mass clinics for the coronavirus. But county health officials are also suddenly dealing with a spike in cases, and many questions remain unanswered, including when a vaccine might arrive and how many doses there will be.
 "It's all kind of up in the air," said Jenny Barta, a public health nurse specialist.

Agents are upset and are banding together to demand change in the industry.


  “This entire pandemic has put strain on every Canadian but I strongly believe that none more so than those of us in the travel industry,” says Manager and Groups Coordinator for CM Travel, Lindsay Schile. “I one hundred percent agree that travellers who have had their trips cancelled should receive refunds but absolutely not at our expense.”


  Travel Agent and ACITA co-founder Brenda Slater echoes that statement.


  “We all know at this point that agents and agencies have done our job, at least twice over in the past several months,” says Slater. “We have assisted in the decision making of their trip, explained the options, sold the trip and managed the details. We have done our jobs, but we are the only industry that feels it acceptable to come back 6 months later to say - we want the money you already earned - returned to us, or we won't refund your client.”


  Agents are finding there can be strength in numbers. At last count, the private Canadian Agents for Change Facebook group has over 1800 members in just two short weeks. Conversations include step by step instructions on how to reach out to local MPs – many of whom have said they were unaware of the commission model for agents.


  That model is what agents are calling for to change.


  “If the government is willing to bail out airlines then the airlines should not be able to turn around and recall our commissions to line their bottom line,” explains Schile. “The government needs to write this in as a contingency or travel agencies and agents need a support package built just for us.”


  “The re-negotiation of supplier contracts is a must for our Hosts/Agency Owners moving forward,” says Slater. “But right now, the only thing we are able to do is to lobby our government to add a condition to the bailouts requiring airlines to protect our commissions. It is concerning that IF this first bailout is approved without protecting commissions, the rest of airlines & tour operators will follow suit, further devastating our industry, and forcing even more closures.”


  ACTA has included commission changes in their overall advocay during the pandemic and Slater urges Advisors/Agencies to reach out to ACITA (even if you are an owner/salary employee) via Facebook, or www.ACITA.ca in the contact section.


  Schile says her hope that after all of this is said and done, that the way our industry operates is changed.


  “Travel agencies make up anywhere from 40 to 60% of a tour operators bookings. I highly doubt that if a call centre agent booked a package for a client and then that package was canceled, the tour operator would clawback their employee’s salary.


  We are by extension employees of the airlines & tour operators. So why are we being left out and stomped on?”

But after two mistrials, Ellis was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on January 4, 1995, at his third trial for the murder and robbery of Boston Police Detective John Mulligan. The prosecution, led by Phyllis Broker, _argued_ that Ellis and Patterson murdered Mulligan in order to steal his service weapon.


  In 2015, Ellis was released on bail after a judge ordered a new trial, predicated on the fact that the corruption of the officers who'd investigated Mulligan's case raised questions about the fairness of Ellis's conviction. _Trial 4_ was intended to follow Sean Ellis as he prepared for his fourth trial, which was scheduled for October 2018. But in 2018, because the witnesses and evidence from the 1995 trial had been called into question, the D.A. _dropped_ all charges against Sean Ellis instead of going through with his fourth trial.


  "The trial evidence and testimony in 1995 proved Mr. Ellis' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Jurors at the time called the case against him overwhelming," then-acting Suffolk County District Attorney John Pappas said. "But the passage of more than two and a half decades has seriously compromised our ability to prove it again. For this reason, my office will file paperwork today ending the prosecution of Mr. Ellis for first-degree murder and armed robbery." Although Pappas noted that the decision to withdraw charges was not made based on the notion that Ellis was wrongfully convicted, he did assert that it had to do with "three corrupt police detectives."


  "If at any point we had any reason to believe that Mr. Ellis was wrongfully charged or convicted, we would have acted on it immediately," Pappas said.


  At this point there have been no reports that Ellis received any sort of compensation or settlement for his years behind bars. _Esquire_ has reached out to Ellis's lawyer to see if he has received any settlement upon the charges being dropped or if they have any plans to sue the police department. They have not returned our requests for comment.


  Sean Ellis has been _transitioning_ back into civilian life since 2015. According to the Justice for Sean Ellis website, Sean frequently speaks out on criminal justice at Massachusetts events and has learned to drive in the years since his release. He currently works as a Development Associate at a Boston nonprofit called Community Servings that prepares and delivers meals to ill and elderly Bostonians, and is set to get married to a colleague in 2021. According to his website, his personal life has never been happier or more stable.
