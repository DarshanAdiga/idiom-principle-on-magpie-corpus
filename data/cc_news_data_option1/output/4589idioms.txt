The board also offered drive-thru voting for people with COVID-19 or who were quarantining because of contact with someone infected. When so many part-time workers became ill, full-time election board staff ended up working the drive- thru line. Brown said she and other employees working the drive-thru line wore personal protective equipment, including gowns, masks, face shields and gloves.

GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face Rafael Warnock, a Black pastor from the church where Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. preached. And Republican Sen. David Perdue, a top Trump ally, will face Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff.
 A Democratic majority in the Senate, the party that also controls the House would give the party a firm grasp on power in Washington. Biden would have latitude over nominees, including for his Cabinet, and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through Congress. If Democrats fall short, McConnell could wield the power to check Biden's ambitions.
 The Democratic leadership team includes Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., as whip; Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., assistant leader, and several others, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., keeping leadership roles. Democrats added Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., to the leadership team.

For all the departures from tradition the game triumphs on, _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_ is not without the momentary failing. Worse, issues from previous games that not only look untreated, but seemingly ignored. The most blatant of which is the manner at which AI functions both inside cutscenes or worse, outside of them whilst still exploring the world. NPCs who seemingly fade out or fade back into existence -- worse, doing so within point-blank range of your person -- or instances where an AI figure can offer consistent one-eighty rotations in some hellish struggle to walk forward and out of shot. Though it remains at the level of nitpick, it's an annoying nitpick that must be raised -- something that one too many times damages part of the immersion the narrative garners. Another brief annoyance (similarly one that is a result of the reuse of assets from prior games) is the manner at which players can sometimes struggle with interacting with objects. Opening safes or simply getting the correct prompt to show in general, though not a new issue, is like AI, something whose clumsy execution can have players, at times, fumble with to get working.

Of course for those having played the first game, Moon's integration of both its aesthetic and of the free-flowing controls on offer should come as no surprise. What should come as a surprise -- and wonderfully so -- lies more on the gameplay front and how, on a mechanical sense, _Will of the Wisps_ improves on the basis of providing an even greater breadth of tools at a player's disposal. There's no place better to start than with the combat -- _Will of the Wisp_ 's most ardent improvement over the original. An element that flows in and out of regular exploration/platforming with immediate and accelerated pace. An arsenal of tools that -- providing you have the accumulated energy to use -- can aid in a helpful chain of melee swipes, projectiles and area-of-effect strikes. Helpful tools for a game that once more should not be underestimated in its scale of difficulty. Even on "Normal" later foes and inevitable boss fights likely to frustrate if one doesn't spend some modest time finding that perfect balance between short-range and longer- ranger offensive means. More importantly, when to mix things up depending on the situation.

It's great to see how gently yet subtly the transition from one region to the next is, yet the route there -- even after many a repeated trek back and forth -- loses none of its appeal. Despite already working out how best to avoid spikes, pitfalls and traps alike, _Will of the Wisps_ revels in the freedom it harbors due to its swift, fluid controls. And it's a set-up that easily and quickly pulls you in. Especially when movement-based abilities further open up and expand late on and you find yourself voluntarily free-running from platform to wall to hanging surface to an object you can use to launch yourself off of -- ending with a grappling to a surface that, at one time, felt impossible. Impossible in the sense the ability required hadn't been unlocked yet, but also that personally you didn't have the confidence to partake in through such risky manoeuvres. And that's the underlining brilliance of _Will of the Wisp_ 's structure in regards to its progression -- the kind of willing involvement that only gets better and better the more you engage with its many mechanics. Regardless of your level of experience or how confident you initially feel or think about this kind of precision-platforming where speed, timing and good reflexes are all key -- the game gently, and cleverly, eases you into the rhythm. Building up set-pieces and conundrums alike where before long, Ori's fast and dexterous move-set becomes second nature.

NEW BEDFORD -- At the beginning of March, business was so good for Anna Rodriques that she and her husband considered buying a new house. Now Rodriques doesn't know how she's going to pay her bills and finds herself going to food pantries to help make ends meet.
 Rodriques' journey as a business owner started 24 years ago, when the factory where she had been working since she was 16 years old, Cameo Curtains, suddenly closed and she decided to stay home for a few months since she had two small children she never spent time with.
 Spending time with her children involved bringing them to school.
 "All of a sudden I had people asking me If I could transport their children too," Rodriques said.
 That gave Rodriques the idea to start her own transportation service, Anna's Mini-bus Service. She went out and bought a van and got all the registrations she needed.
 Over the next two decades the business grew to four 15-passenger vans that were making trips to 12 schools in New Bedford in addition to daycares with her husband and father-in-law working as drivers.
 At the beginning of the year, her vans were transporting close to 100 children a day.
 "It was actually really good, it was the best year we've had," Rodriques said. She even had a waiting list of potential clients.
 Then, a couple of weeks into March, Mayor Jon Mitchell announced that New Bedford schools would close to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They would remain closed for the remainder of the spring term and daycares would be limited to children of essential workers for months, drying up Rodriques' customer base.
 A few months later in June Rodriques said she got a letter from the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) notifying her that she would no longer be able to operate 15-passenger vans to transport school children.
 The RMV regulation prohibiting the transportation of school children in 12-passenger and larger vans went into effect July 1, according to Department of Transportation spokesperson Judith Reardon Riley, but had been "under development" with the pupil transportation industry for over a decade.
 When Riley spoke to The Standard-Times last month she didn't clarify the exact nature of the safety concerns related to the 12+ passenger vans, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said full-size vans, especially 15-passenger vans, are known to be less safe than most other vehicles mainly due to their propensity to roll over.
 Rodriques said the RMV revoked her registration for the 15-passenger vans and because of that she was forced to sell them.
 "I've been home since March then the RMV hit me with that. Great, now I can't do anything," she said.
 Rodriques tried to get some of the smaller 10-passenger vans that the RMV still permits, but said between the amount of money the business lost during the pandemic and the cost of 10-passengers vans, she could not afford them, especially since COVID-19 guidelines would only allow her to transport three children at a time if she did buy them.
 Rodriques said if the RMV notified her of the new regulations sooner and it wasn't a pandemic she would have been on the ball and would have been able to get the appropriately-sized vehicles.
 According to Riley, the regulations have been on the books for two years and the RMV held a number of information sessions prior to the regulations going into effect.
 Due to the pandemic, the RMV did allow operators of 12-passenger vans to apply for a one-year waiver to continue operating, but they didn't offer 15-passenger van operators the same opportunity.
 "It was pretty messed up.... They should have given us a waiver for the 15-passenger vehicles like they did for the 12 and they didn't do that, especially knowing people were out of work for so many months," Rodriques said. "I got screwed by COVID and screwed by the RMV."
 Rodriques did apply for a Personal Paycheck Protection (PPP) loan, but since she's self-employed she said she only qualified for $1,000.
 She has also been having issues filing for unemployment because, she said, someone used her name and Social Security number to apply for unemployment benefits in another state and she is currently trying to work that out with the unemployment office.
 "I received a letter that someone had applied [for unemployment benefits] in my name.... I don't understand how they got my social [security number] to open a claim," Rodriques said.
 She said she's been waiting a week for a supervisor at the unemployment office to call her back.
 "It's pretty tough," she said.
 She's been clearing houses to make money, but it still hasn't been enough to cover her expenses.
 "Thank God I've been going to PACE ... and they've been helping me out with some food and stuff," Rodriques said. "I never had to do that in my life."
 Rodriques never pictured herself being someone who needed to use a food pantry.
 "I was doing good," she said.
 She said she does feel bad for everyone during the pandemic but she thinks things have been harder for immigrant-owned businesses.
 "I do feel that if you have money and were born in this country you have a better chance [to survive]," Rodriques said.
 Rodriques' family came to New Bedford from Portugal when she was 10 years old after her father came to visit his sister in the city for three months.
 "I just have so much anger towards this disease and towards everything, because like I said it took so much from me. It's my livelihood, it's everything I worked for," Rodriques said. "I built [my business] from nothing only to lose it."
 COVID-19 has impacted more than just her business. Her daughter recently tested positive for the disease and is symptomatic with coughing fits and massive headaches.
 "You feel so bad as a mother that you can't go there to help her," Rodriques said. "Of course I'm worried, I'm worried for myself, I'm worried for everyone else.... This [pandemic] is insane. When is it going to end? It doesn't look like there's an end in sight."
 When the pandemic does end, Rodriques said it's her hope to restart her business, even though she knows she'll have to start from the beginning.
 Helena DaSilva Hughes, executive director of the Immigrants Assistance Center, said she is working to help business owners like Rodriques, making sure they know about grants and loans available to small businesses.
 The New Bedford Economic Development Council is taking applications for a grant and loan program meant to assist small businesses that are struggling during the pandemic and Hughes is working with them to make sure immigrant- owned businesses know about the program.
 "We want to make sure businesses are included," Hughes said.

MADISON, Wis. — The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has not expanded the state's popular SeniorCare program to include coverage for vaccines, despite being required under a bipartisan law and as flu season begins while the coronavirus ravages the state.
 Republican lawmakers are demanding an explanation from Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm, calling the delay an “unnecessary roadblock for seniors looking to protect themselves from infectious diseases.”
 Once a COVID-19 vaccine is available, it should also be covered under the expansion that lawmakers approved in April.
 SeniorCare is a state prescription drug assistance program for people over age 65 who make up to $30,625 a year. There are about 95,000 people in the program. The state health department has said it needs to formally amend the program to access federal money to pay for the vaccinations, moves that are still in the works.
 State Rep. John Nygren and Sen. Alberta Darling, Republican co-chairs of the Legislature’s budget committee, wrote to Palm on Friday asking her to implement the expansion immediately.
 “The delay in implementation is concerning and we have heard from constituents that it has blocked efforts to receive vaccinations,” they said.
 DHS spokeswoman Jennifer Miller said the agency's attorneys are reviewing Nygren and Darling's request “to inform our next steps.”
 “We all agree that seniors need access to vaccine, and the Department will ensure they they have access to the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available,” she said.
 Palm, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, has emerged as a lightning rod for conservative criticism during the coronavirus pandemic, with some state senators saying they will vote to fire her by rejecting her confirmation.
 Palm and Evers have been united in efforts to fight the pandemic, including the statewide mask mandate and attempts blocked by courts to limit capacity in bars and restaurants and the “safer at home” order that closed many businesses early in the outbreak.
 A coronavirus aid bill that the Legislature passed with near-unanimous support in April, and that Evers signed into law, included a provision to expand the SeniorCare program to cover existing recommended vaccinations as well as any COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available.
 The department should have acted more quickly to implement the law, Nygren and Darling said.
 State law required the expanded coverage for vaccinations to take effect on April 17, an attorney for the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal advice to the Legislature, said in an Oct. 28 letter to Nygren.
 The state could fund vaccinations provided through SeniorCare while it waits for approval from the federal government to help cover the costs, Nygren and Darling wrote. The vaccinations are expected to cost about $80,000 a year.
 Expanding the services “improves the quality of care offered to Wisconsin’s seniors and will help protect a vulnerable population from COVID-19 when a vaccine is developed and approved,” Darling and Nygren wrote.
 Palm said in an Oct. 19 letter to Nygren and Darling that before the expanded coverage could be implemented, the Legislature's budget committee needed to approve an amendment to the SeniorCare program so it could get federal reimbursement. That approval was given last week.

WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joe Biden is looking to build out his nascent White House staff with more traditional Washington insiders, a notable departure from four years in which President Donald Trump filled his team with outsiders and government antagonists.
 Ron Klain is an early favorite to become Biden's chief of staff, according to multiple people familiar with planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely about private discussions. He has decades of Washington experience that includes being Biden's chief of staff when he was vice president in addition to serving as the Ebola response coordinator in 2014 and having a central role in the Obama administration's financial crisis response.
 Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a longtime Biden ally and friend, is seen as a potential choice for secretary of state. Rep. Karen Bass of California, whom Biden considered for vice president, is seen as a potential housing and urban development secretary. Both served in Congress for the past decade.
 Biden is expected to move quickly to name a chief of staff, but other top Cabinet positions will likely take longer.
 The names under consideration represent Biden's effort to move Washington past the tumult of President Donald Trump's administration and fill out his government with more seasoned professionals. The task is taking on even greater urgency than in past transitions because Biden will take office in January amid a raging pandemic that will likely consume the early days of his presidency and require a full government response.
 Biden made clear on Monday that he would focus on the pandemic by forming a coronavirus advisory board. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was named a co-chair of that panel, is seen as a contender for the top job at the Department of Health and Human Services. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who ran her state's health department, is also being eyed for the position.
 Even for roles where Biden has the opportunity to make history and appoint the first woman or African American Cabinet secretary, like at defense and treasury, Biden is said to be considering options with decades of experience in their chosen fields.
 Roger Ferguson, who served as vice chair of the Federal Reserve under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, is a potential treasury secretary, while Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense, is seen as a top pick to lead the Pentagon.
 Some Democrats are hopeful that the more traditional picks will help rebuild morale among the thousands of civil servants who felt thwarted at doing their jobs under Trump.
 “You’re not only talking about people who have an expertise in government functions, you’re talking about people who have a great deal of respect for government functions," said Ed Espinoza, former western states political director for the Democratic National Committee. “That’s a key distinction between the Trump administration and a Biden administration.”
 It's a striking shift from Trump, who built out his Cabinet with a raft of unorthodox picks, many of whom were openly skeptical of the federal government's role in the jobs they were tasked with.
 Betsy DeVos, an advocate for steering federal money to private charter schools, led the Education Department. Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general who’s a skeptic of the science showing humans contribute to climate change, ran the Environmental Protection Agency.
 And Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who initially served as White House budget director, supported shutting down the government to rein in federal spending and was critical of some of the proposals Trump aimed to invest in, like a massive infrastructure policy.
 Still, Biden faces a number of major unknowns as he prepares for the presidency.
 First, the scope of Biden’s first-term agenda will hinge on which party controls the Senate, which remains in question with two special Senate elections in Georgia scheduled for the first week in January. Democrats have acknowledged they will likely need to pare back some of Biden’s campaign trail promises even if they do hold the majority in a closely divided Senate, and a slim majority could also affect the kinds of nominees Biden can hope to get approved for top Cabinet slots.
 The most imminent unknown for Biden, however, remains to what extent Trump and his administration will work with the former vice president as his team begins its efforts to transition the government.
 The General Services Administration is tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect, beginning the transition process. But the agency’s Trump- appointed administrator, Emily Murphy, has not started the process and has given no guidance on when she will do so.
 That lack of clarity is fueling questions about whether Trump, who has not publicly recognized Biden’s victory and has falsely claimed the election was stolen, will impede Democrats as they try to establish a government.
 There is little precedent in the modern era of a president erecting such hurdles for his successor. The stakes are especially high this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, which will require a comprehensive government response.
 “America’s national security and economic interests depend on the federal government signaling clearly and swiftly that the United States government will respect the will of the American people and engage in a smooth and peaceful transfer of power,” Jen Psaki, a Biden transition aide, tweeted Sunday.
 South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, an ally of Biden's on Capitol Hill, said that if Trump continues to drag his feet, then he hopes that “my conservative friends in Congress will have an intervention.”
 “This country is bigger than one person, and to allow the people of this country to suffer -- we are near 245,000 deaths, and we’re still messing around and won’t get the relief that people need,” he said.
 Indeed, some Republicans on Capitol Hill called for a smooth transition Monday. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican and occasional Trump antagonist, congratulated Biden on his victory and said in a statement that “presidential transitions are important" and that Biden and Vice President- elect Kamala Harris should “be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern on January 20th.”

WASHINGTON — U.S. health officials have allowed emergency use of the first antibody drug to help the immune system fight COVID-19, an experimental approach against the virus that has killed more than 238,000 Americans.
 The Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared the experimental drug from Eli Lilly for people 12 and older with mild or moderate COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization. It's a one-time treatment given through an IV.
 The therapy is still undergoing additional testing to establish its safety and effectiveness. It is similar to a treatment President Donald Trump received after contracting the virus last month.
 Early results suggest the drug, called bamlanivimab, may help clear the coronavirus sooner and possibly cut hospitalizations in people with mild to moderate COVID-19. A study of it in hospitalized patients was stopped when independent monitors saw the drug did not seem to be helping in that situation.
 The government previously reached an agreement to buy and supply much of the early production of Lilly's drug.
 Only one drug -- Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir -- has full FDA approval for treating COVID-19. Government treatment guidelines also back using dexamethasone and other steroids for certain severely ill, hospitalized patients.
 One other treatment has an emergency use designation now — convalescent plasma, or the blood of COVID-19 survivors. No large studies have shown it to be more effective than usual care alone, however.
 The new drug is part of an emerging family of biologic therapies that offer a promising new approach to preventing serious disease and death from COVID-19. Experts say the infused drugs could serve as a therapeutic bridge to help manage the virus until vaccines are widely available.
 The drugs are laboratory-made versions of antibodies, blood proteins which the body creates to help target and eliminate foreign infections. The new therapies are concentrated versions of the antibodies that proved most effective against the virus in patient studies.
 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. also has asked for emergency authorization for an antibody drug it is testing, the one Trump received.
 FDA regulators authorized the Lilly drug using their emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs and other medical products during public health crises.
 In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” to show that a drug is safe and effective, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can lower those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
 The emergency authorization functions like a temporary approval for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. To win full approval, Lilly will have to submit additional research to fully define the drug’s safety and benefit for patients.
 The government has signed an agreement with Lilly to spend $375 million to buy 300,000 vials of the drug. How many doses that would provide is unclear. Each vial contains 700 milligrams and that dose proved ineffective in the early results. It took four times that amount — 2,800 milligrams — to show any effect.
 The Lilly drug is authorized for people 12 and older who weigh at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have certain chronic medical conditions.
