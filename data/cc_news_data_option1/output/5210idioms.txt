To his partial credit, it appears Johns Hopkins eventually righted his moral compass. While census data reflects that he “owned” one slave in 1840 and four in 1850, I did not read that the researchers had found that he owned any in 1860. In a March 1873 letter, he directed the trustees-to-be of the hospital he was founding to treat “the indigent sick … without regard to sex, creed, or color.” He died that December. The elite university also funded by his estate was founded in 1876; the first African-American student was admitted in 1887. All in all, not a stellar track record, but, given the times, better than many.
 I salute the present effort to confront history and debate what impact it should have on present arrangements. It may just be that, as with George Washington who bequeathed his own slaves to his widow in 1797, we recognize the deplorable history, weigh it against the good the person accomplished, and decide to maintain the widely recognized names, with annotations, and not name any more places after them. Or not. Time will tell.

An Abuse Of Power At The Most Catastrophic Level': Los Angeles County DA George Gascón Under Fire For Policy Changes

“We believe strongly in Mario’s track record here at Oregon,” Mullens said. “And the foundation is in place for future success.”
 Cristobal’s $2.7 million base salary for this season will increase to $4.3 million on Jan. 15. Cristobal’s current salary ranked 57th nationally and 11th in the Pac-12 ahead of only Oregon State’s Jonathan Smith ($2.4 million), according to the USA Today coaches salary database.
 The new deal, which runs through Jan. 14, 2026, elevates Cristobal to a top- four salary in the Pac-12 and top-25 nationally. The base salary increases $100,000 each year and $150,000 in the final year.
 In three seasons as Oregon’s coach, Cristobal has posted a 24-9 overall record (16-7 in conference games).
 The defending Pac-12 champion Ducks (3-2) will play No. 13 USC in the conference championship game Friday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
 “I am humbled and honored to be part of the best college football program in the country,” Cristobal said in a statement. “The tremendous commitment from the university and our administration to our student-athletes, coaches, and support staff is unmatched and has been unwavering since day one. I am grateful to President Schill and Rob Mullens for all of their support and for entrusting our staff with the future of Oregon football.”
 Discussions between Mullens and Cristobal about a new contract began after Oregon finished the 2019 season 12-2 with a victory over Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl. The negotiations were shelved due to the COVID-19 health crisis before restarting recently as the coaching carousel began to spin again.

"I've never done one before. I've been part of many independent shows, but I've never done it. I never had the pen. I've never had the book. So I reached out to a friend of mine, Brett Lauderdale at GCW, who in my opinion, out of any of the other independent promotions has really been leading the charge in terms of showing by example how these things can be done."
 Iovine then discussed the goals for Prochella noting that if you are not signed to a major wrestling promotion, COVID has hit you hard as a pro wrestler. He also talked about how Prochella was meant to be a spotlight for west coast talent.
 "Of course, we're in a really really shi--y time right now," Iovine pointed out. "I don't think anybody knows, fully, what this thing is, and we're doing the best we can for people. When we say 'we', I'm saying people we're trying to put on shows. We're not trying to put on shows by and large because we want to make money. We're not in a situation right now where these shows are going to make a lot of money. Right now, what we're trying to do, at least what I'm trying to do with Mike with this show, is get these wrestlers paid because right now, if you're not signed to a major company, TNA, AEW, WWE [or] New Japan, you're not doing much right now, and the shows are getting cancelled.
 "The shows are getting moved. The shows are getting postponed. The WWE guys don't even have insurance, let alone independent guys. At least when WWE guys get injured, they'll pay for the surgery by and large. These guys, it's gotta come out of their own pocket. I'm not going to name names, but a friend of mine just lost his father to COVID. Another wrestler, friend of mine, lost his father to COVID, and they don't have the money to fly him back to bury him.
 "The whole purpose of Prochella was to make sure that A, the west coast scene was featured because I really wanted to show that the west coast scene wasn't relying on one person because as we all know, the west coast scene suffered a huge setback. There was the Me Too allegations and whatnot that happened to the unnamed people. Whether they be true or not, the west coast scene really took a huge hit because we lost a major venue for a lot of west coast acts to be featured, and I wanted to show that the west coast isn't just reliant on one entity or one person."
 Hausman had Iovine clarify that he was referencing Bar Wrestling and Joey Ryan and his accusations made during the Speaking Out movement. He noted how important Bar Wrestling was to many independent talents because of the exposure the promotion provided.
 "The loss of Bar Wrestling was huge," Iovine noted. "A lot of people really really really got to shine at Bar Wrestling, and a lot of people looked at Bar Wrestling as a bi-weekly or weekly show to really -- if I'm not booked this week on an indie show in Kansas City or in Jersey, then at least I have Bar Wresting. I know that somebody is watching. A lot of big names come out of Bar Wrestling, Jungle Boy, Luchasaurus [and] The [Young] Bucks.
 "They didn't come from Bar Wrestling, but a lot of them got their shine there. Until another one of those things comes back, and I think they will. I've been hearing rumblings of a lot of people looking at the same venue or are trying to do something similar in the same vain as just giving fans a weekly show, and until we get that, because LA is the most locked down city out of I think all of them in the country. I was looking to Vegas to do this, and through Brett and GCW, they were helping me."
 Iovine said that Prochella was going to be in Las Vegas and would have followed the proper COVID-19 regulations. He also said that the show would have been a west coast vs. GCW type event.
 "It was going to be in Las Vegas at the Meet Las Vegas, the name of the venue, and it was going to be outside in the Pavilion that they had because I wanted to make sure that during the day when it's a little hotter, I wanted to be outside," Iovine said. "Spread out, masks required all, the proper COVID regulations. I called it Prochella. I'm not going to take credit for that name. Yuma gave me that name. So I'll give all the credit to Yuma. It's the west coast wrestling scene being featured, and a lot of the matches were kind of fun because it was almost the west coast vs. GCW."
 Iovine revealed the matches that was originally booked for Prochella. He expressed his hopes for running Prochella if COVID numbers decrease in early spring.
 "I announced a lot of the wrestlers that I had, but I wasn't able to announce any of the matches I'd booked yet because literally the week I was going to announce the matches, we got postponed," Iovine recalled. "And I had some great ones man. I had [Chris] Dickinson vs. Bad Boy Tito, two big motherf-- kers just going at each other. I had Jordan Oliver vs. Adrian Quest. Adrian Quest is really coming up in the scene right now. Heather Monroe vs. Allie Kat, which had never happened before, which is crazy to me. That's a dream match of mine, but again, we didn't really have the opportunity to announce it.
 "Going forward, we're literally looking for late winter, maybe early spring for a new date because these new lockdowns are going to be at least until January. So that's what we're looking towards. That's really all it was just taking really great west coast talent that just needed a stage. They just needed a platform, and I just know people will fall in love with them."
 Iovine also recalled when he found out that Prochella would be postponed. He also expressed his desire to help out the independent wrestling scene.
 "The last Friday, I was working on something because my business is a retail company. We had Black Friday coming up," Iovine recalled. "So we were just doing some calls and stuff, and then I was watching the news. The governor of Nevada basically said, tonight, I'm imposing a laundry list of new regulations and stuff, and I texted Brett then. I was like, 'Is this is going to affect us?' And he said, 'It might.' So we were just waiting, and then that night the governor dropped a lot of Las Vegas regulations. Basically no more indoor gatherings, outdoor gatherings are cut in half. The limit is just my talent and my crew. That's not even talking fans, and I'm really really really happy that Brett [had] the GCW show that he planned on having indoors but with no fans.
 "Just getting these guys paid, which I think is cool, and he [set] up a donation to help out with a lot of these guys who would have been paid. A lot of these guys were going to do double duty. They were going to work that show and my show, and so they're losing out on that money as well. So I'm going to be donating a good amount of the money that was going towards this show will be going towards the GCW fund. My business manager, who handles my accounts and all this stuff, when I was putting all this money together, she was like, 'You're not going to see a return on this at all. You'll break even maybe,' and then I said, 'That's not the point. Nobody's point right now should really be to make a profit.' In my opinion, right now, everybody's goal, who's not signed to a major business [or] major promotion should be to save the independent scene.
 "That should be first and foremost before anything, before a t-shirt, before a new Twitch stream, before any of that stuff. Whatever you're doing in the wrestling business should be aimed at not only making your brand last through COVID, but also the indie promotions that the fans love, that the fans want to keep supporting because if we lose those, we're back to where we were back in 2009 - 2010 where if you weren't on those three companies, you aren't doing s --t. And I don't want to see that. We've worked so hard, worked so hard to come to this place that we are now."

The ACC has been marred by single-team dominance, first Florida State and now Clemson.
 The Big 12 did away with divisional play in 2011 and returned to the championship game in 2017, and the games have better. The three Big 12 title games with No. 1 vs. No. 2 in the conference standings have been collectively better than the previous Big 12 norm. OU’s 39-27 survival of Texas in 2018 and the 30-23 overtime conquest of Baylor in 2019 were excellent games.
 This weekend brings another slate of conference title games, and at least two of the marquee games appear to be one-sided -- Ohio State-Northwestern and Alabama-Florida.

Dopo 48 giorni difficili, l’indesiderato covid-19 ha fatto capolino nel roster biancorosso, il Gesam Gas e Luce Le Mura Lucca è pronto a tonare sul parquet per una partita ufficiale. Domani (sabato 18 dicembre), palla a due fissata alle 17, le biancorosse affronteranno al PalaSegrafedo la Virtus Bologna, seconda forza della Techfind Serie A1 con un eloquente rendimento di dieci vittorie e solo una sconfitta e già qualificata assieme alla capolista Umana Reyer Venezia, alla Passalacqua Ragusa e alla Famila Schio per le “Final eight” di Coppa Italia. Impegno tosto, tenendo presente che tra le mura amiche le emiliane non hanno mai perso, per un Bakset Le Mura che si presenterà a questo appuntamento con un roster rimaneggiato e con l’incognita rappresentata dal ritrovare il ritmo partita dopo ben cinque rinvii.
 La squadra di coach Francesco Iurlaro affronterà, quindi, una delle vedette di questo torneo cercando, al netto delle note difficoltà che può provocare un lungo periodo di lontananza dalle gare, di disputare un ottimo match su uno dei più prestigiosi parquet della pallacanestro nazionale. Dopo la stagione d’esordio nel massimo campionato, la Virtus Segafredo Bologna ha confermato buona parte del gruppo storico tra cui la capitana Elisabetta Tassinari, la playmaker Marie D’Alie, Alessandra Tava, Jomanda Rosier, Simona Cordisco e il pivot Ana Marija Begic, capace di viaggiare con una media di 13,9 punti e 10,6 rimbalzi a serata. Proprio il comparto delle lunghe rappresenta uno dei punti di forza di Bologna, abile in estate ad ingaggiare dai Townsville Fire l’esperto centro australiano Abby Bishop. Devastante l’impatto con la Serie A1 per la classe 1988, bronzo olimpico a Londra 2012 con la sua nazionale, che è l’unica cestista di tutto il campionato a distribuire una media superiore ai 20 punti a partita, ai quali unisce anche un solido contributo difensivo. Non è un caso che il team bolognese sia il secondo di tutto il torneo alla voce dei rimbalzi complessivi conquistati, ben 418.
 Da Torino è arrivata una giocatrice di assoluto rendimento come Maria Beatrice Barberis mentre dalla Famila Schio i dirigenti bianconeri sono riusciti a portare sotto le Due Torri la playmaker Valeria Battisodo (5 assist di media smazzati a partita), campionessa d’Italia con il Basket Le Mura nella stagione 2016-2017. Il quarto volto nuovo della Virtus versione 2020-2021 risponde al nome di Brooque Williams, nella passata stagione in forza alla Geas Sesto San Giovanni. La guardia americana sta fornendo un contributo importante alla causa emiliana come testimoniato dai suoi 17,5 punti e 5,1 rimbalzi di media.
 Il compito di presentare l’impegno in terra bolognese, cancellato nella passata stagione dalla sospensione della Serie A1, spetta al vice allenatore del Basket Le Mura Lorenzo Puschi. “A mio avviso la Virtus Bologna è la vera sorpresa di questo campionato.” – spiega Puschi- “In estate hanno inserito quei tasselli giusti, vedi Williams, Bishop e Battisodo, che li consentono di ottenere grandi risultati sebbene possano contare su delle corte rotazioni. Il terzetto Begic-Bishop-Williams fornisce un grosso contributo offensivo alla causa bianconera, con coach Serventi che può contare su un solido e affiatato gruppo di italiane. Dal canto nostro, ci apprestiamo ad affrontare questo impegno consci sia dei 50 giorni lontani dalle competizioni ufficiali che delle assenze tra le nostra fila. Andremo al PalaSegrafedo senza alcun tipo di pressione con l’obiettivo di fornire una buona prestazione.”
 Virtus Segafredo Bologna-Gesam Gas e Luce Le Mura Lucca sarà diretta dal primo arbitro Vladislav Doronin, coadiuvato da Emanuela Tommasi e Chiara Corrias.

Not long ago, I met with someone compiling articles to create a book. Most of them were spawned from experiences throughout her life that taught her lessons she hoped to pass on. I am typically all ears to learn from the successes and failures of others so I don’t have to reinvent the wheel, so I tuned in with great attention.
 Yet, even with my expressions and verbal affirmations of interest, she seemed to doubt at that moment that she had anything of great value to offer. This, of course, is ludicrous, but it occurred to me that most of us believe this lie at some point in our lives.

“We’ve all been at this a long time, and you always wonder what’s the end game, when can this possibly be over,” he said Friday in a radio interview with Z92.5. “When you hear the vaccine start being distributed to our frontline workers ... it’s just a great day. It’s exciting. It’s the light at the end of the tunnel.”
 Joe Hooper, president of Community Howard Regional Health, called the rollout of vaccines a "significant milestone," though stressed that the community continue to wear masks and practice social distancing.
 "While we celebrate these initial distributions of the vaccine, it is critical that the public not let its guard down as we remain months away from large- scale distributions available for the public," he said in a statement provided to the Tribune. "We are in the midst of a significant surge in cases in Howard County and must continue to follow practices of mask wearing and avoiding gatherings to slow the current surge.”
 As of Dec. 15, only the state’s frontline workers, long-term facility care staff and emergency medical service providers are eligible to receive the vaccine, according to the Indiana State Department of Health.
 The state received 55,575 doses this week - enough to vaccinate nearly 28,000 people as the Pfizer vaccine is given in two doses - and began distributing them to area hospitals earlier this week. Indiana State Department of Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Lindsay Weaver said the state expects to prioritize healthcare and long-term care employees into January.

When winter cold settles in across the U.S., the alleged “War on Christmas” heats up.
 In recent years, department store greeters and Starbucks cups have sparked furor by wishing customers “happy holidays.” This year, with state officials warning of holiday gatherings becoming superspreader events in the midst of a pandemic, opponents of some public health measures to limit the spread of the pandemic are already casting them as attacks on the Christian holiday.
 But debates about celebrating Christmas go back to the 17th century. The Puritans, it turns out, were not too keen on the holiday. They first discouraged Yuletide festivities and later outright banned them.
 At first glance, banning Christmas celebrations might seem like a natural extension of a stereotype of the Puritans as joyless and humorless that persists to this day.
 But as a scholar who has written about the Puritans, I see their hostility toward holiday gaiety as less about their alleged asceticism and more about their desire to impose their will on the people of New England – Natives and immigrants alike.
 An aversion to Christmas chaos
 The earliest documentary evidence for their aversion to celebrating Christmas dates back to 1621, when Gov. William Bradford of Plymouth Colony castigated some of the newcomers who chose to take the day off rather than work.
 But why?
 As a devout Protestant, Bradford did not dispute the divinity of Jesus Christ. Indeed, Puritans spent a great deal of time investigating their own and others’ souls because they were so committed to creating a godly community.
 Bradford’s comments reflected Puritans’ lingering anxiety about the ways that Christmas had been celebrated in England. For generations, the holiday had been an occasion for riotous, sometimes violent behavior. The moralist pamphleteer Phillip Stubbes believed that Christmastime celebrations gave celebrants license “to do what they lust, and to folow what vanitie they will.” He complained about rampant “fooleries” like playing dice and cards and wearing masks.
 Civil authorities had mostly accepted the practices because they understood that allowing some of the disenfranchised to blow off steam on a few days of the year tended to preserve an unequal social order. Let the poor think they are in control for a day or two, the logic went, and the rest of the year they will tend to their work without causing trouble.
 English Puritans objected to accepting such practices because they feared any sign of disorder. They believed in predestination, which led them to search their own and others’ behavior for signs of saving grace. They could not tolerate public scandal, especially when attached to a religious moment.
 Puritan efforts to crack down on Christmas revelries in England before 1620 had little impact. But once in North America, these seekers of religious freedom had control over the governments of New Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut.
 Puritan intolerance
 Boston became the focal point of Puritan efforts to create a society where church and state reinforced each other.
 The Puritans in Plymouth and Massachusetts used their authority to punish or banish those who did not share their views. For example, they exiled an Anglican lawyer named Thomas Morton who rejected Puritan theology, befriended local Indigenous people, danced around a maypole and sold guns to the Natives. He was, Bradford wrote, “the Lord of Misrule” – the archetype of a dangerous type who Puritans believed create mayhem, including at Christmas.
 In the years that followed, the Puritans exiled others who disagreed with their religious views, including Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams who espoused beliefs deemed unacceptable by local church leaders. In 1659, they banished three Quakers who had arrived in 1656. When two of them, William Robinson and Marmaduke Stephenson, refused to leave, Massachusetts authorities executed them in Boston.
 This was the context for which Massachusetts authorities outlawed Christmas celebrations in 1659. Even after the statute left the law books in 1681 during a reorganization of the colony, prominent theologians still despised holiday festivities.
 In 1687, the minister Increase Mather, who believed that Christmas celebrations derived from the bacchanalian excesses of the Roman holiday Saturnalia, decried those consumed “in Revellings, in excess of wine, in mad mirth.”
 The hostility of Puritan clerics to celebrations of Christmas should not be seen as evidence that they always hoped to stop joyous behavior. In 1673, Mather had called alcohol “a good creature of God” and had no objection to moderate drinking. Nor did Puritans have a negative view of sex.

 What the Puritans did want was a society dominated by their views. This made them eager to convert Natives to Christianity, which they managed to do in some places. They tried to quash what they saw as usurious business practices within their community, and in Plymouth they executed a teenager who had sex with animals, the punishment prescribed by the Book of Leviticus. When the Puritans believed that Indigenous people might attack them or undermine their economy, they lashed out – most notoriously in 1637, when they set a Pequot village on fire, murdered those who tried to flee and sold captives into slavery.
 By comparison to their treatment of Natives and fellow colonists who rebuffed their unbending vision, the Puritan campaign against Christmas seems tame. But it is a reminder of what can happen when the self-righteous control the levers of power in a society and seek to mold a world in their image.
