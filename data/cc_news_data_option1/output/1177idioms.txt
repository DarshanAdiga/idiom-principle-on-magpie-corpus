Ventec has had to ramp up production while also increasing safety precautions: the company has instituted mandatory temperature checks on team members, mandated six-feet of distance at work, and has moved meetings outside whenever possible so that employees can spread out. "It's doing what we do every day, but doing it faster and on a larger scale," Brooks says. "Literally this is changing by the hour as partners come on board." One of those partners is auto behemoth General Motors, which is working to partner with Ventec to build up to 200,000 ventilators, with the automaker considering converting its parts plant in Kokomo, Indiana, to assemble the components.

A team of hornblowers are to work from home as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.


  A horn has been sounded four times in Ripon's Market Place every night at 21:00 BST since AD886 to "set the watch".


  The tradition will now take place behind closed doors after the government issued strict new guidance.


  The council said the change meant the ceremony would still take place within the city boundary.


  The last time hornblowing in Ripon faced such serious disruption was during the Second World War.

The Exeter Police Department took to Facebook Monday to thank a community member who donated a box of N95 respirator masks to the department that day.


   


  Chief Stephan Poulin said the donation was "very helpful" for augmenting the department's supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), but recommended all donations of gear should be donated to hospital workers and other healthcare workers for the time being as they prepare for a possible surge in patients.


   


  "As things progress and more people test positive (for coronavirus), officers will have to begin wearing these more often," Poulin said. "These masks can be reused by the officers unless they are involved in the proximity of a positively tested person."


   


  As concerns grow over nationwide shortages of PPE for healthcare workers and first responders dealing with the pandemic, Seacoast police chiefs said their agencies are working with their fire departments to ensure emergency personnel is protected when interacting with members of the public.


   


  They said in the event staffing levels are reduced because of officers being infected with COVID-19, a mutual aid network among Seacoast communities will help plug officers into communities in need. For now, they said officers are assisting residents at home or dropping off summonses for minor offenses and trying to conduct as much business outside the individual's home as possible.


   


  For most people, COVID-19 results in only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. People with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health Organization.


   


  For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.


   


  Poulin said Exeter officers are now disinfecting their gear and cruisers "multiple times" per shift. He said he has been working on organizing a network of off-duty personnel, who would be on call in the event of officers getting sick or being forced to quarantine, and cross-training officers for temporary dispatch duty.


   


  Exeter and many other police departments have closed their main lobbies for walk-in service and residents are directed to make reports by phone, after which an officer will follow-up by phone, Poulin said. He said one of his primary concerns is the safety of officers when interacting in-person with suspects who may unknowingly have the virus.


   


  "This is a major concern and operations have been modified to limit this as much as possible," Poulin said. "The focus has to be on the hospitals and medical professionals at this time (receiving donations of PPE). We will get by with what we have at this point."


   


  Stratham Chief Anthony King said his department's stock of PPE was well situated by partnering with the Volunteer Fire Department. He said officers have been issued eye protection, gloves and masks and they are required to sanitize their cruisers before and after their patrol shifts.


   


  King said Stratham police have a limited number of protective gowns for officers, who are each keeping an additional uniform at the station in case of potential exposure.


   


  "Officers have been instructed to distance themselves and use their protective gear, however, if the officer comes into contact with a possible carrier, then we are following all CDC guidelines," King said.


   


  The department has reduced many of the public services it offers residents.


   


  "The public has been very understanding as we have temporarily suspended some of our police services such as car seat installations/inspections, tours of the PD, ride-alongs and fingerprinting residents," he said.


   


  Dover Chief William Breault said his department also was no longer able to provide public services, such as fingerprinting for various jobs that require them.


   


  "Unfortunately, it's something we've had to stop during a pandemic," he said. "When it's all over we'll offer the same customer services again."


   


  Breault said Dover police have had to stop issuing individual hygiene kits for its 50-plus officers but are keeping kits in individual cruisers and they must clean them before and after use. He said working alongside the Fire Department, he felt confident in the police's supply of PPE for the next few weeks, provided there is not an extreme spike in EMS calls reporting COVID-19 symptoms.


   


  "(The outbreak) has forced us not only to look at our day-to-day planning and how we operate but also look at our long-term planning because this will be a prolonged issue," Breault said. "We're in pretty uncharted territory so it's hard to forecast what the surge in cases will be, but we have to prepare for the worst and the state has assured us we will have a steady supply of PPE gear."


   


  Hampton Deputy Chief David Hobbs said dispatchers are taking another level of thoroughness when screening calls to make sure officers are not unnecessarily sent to locations and put at risk of being exposed.


   


  "If the Fire Department gets a medical call and we go to assist as well, we'll keep a safe distance," Hobbs said. "Everybody is frustrated but we still want people to call because our emergency responses haven't changed and we'll be there. But if it's something that's non-emergency, then we'll look to alternative ways to resolve the issue."


   


  Portsmouth Chief Robert Merner said his department was well stocked with supplies including bleach wipes, Tyvek suits and hand sanitizer, but is short on N95 masks.


   


  Merner said like many departments, Portsmouth officers have been forced to minimize most of their interactions with residents.


   


  "We're working with private suppliers and members of the public, whatever we can get for PPE," Merner said. "(The pandemic) doesn't mean we give up, but we're limiting our social contacts as much as possible within the limits of the law enforcement profession."

ELKTON — The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way that all the restaurants, taverns and cafes in Cecil County are able to do business, but a new county tourism contest has a creative approach to make things fun.


  While still considered "essential" per Monday's executive order from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, these eateries are struggling to stay afloat in the new normal of take-out, drive-thru and delivery.


  Cecil County Tourism has launched the "Cecil Eats" contest to encourage people to patronize their favorite place.


  Sandy Turner, director of Cecil County Tourism, said the idea came during a brainstorming session, looking for ways to support the many eateries in the county.


  Go to the Cecil County Tourism Facebook page, like the page and share the Cecil Eats post. Then, for your chance to win $100 in gift cards from restaurants and other county tourism locales, save the receipt from your recent meal and post it to that FB page tagged with #CecilEats.


  The photo of the receipt must show the date of purchase along with the name of the restaurant.


  Selena Morrison-Chin, head bartender and interim assistant manager at Prime 225 in Chesapeake City applauds the effort and reports the restaurant -- known for its steaks and other fine dining -- is doing well in spite of the pandemic.


  "We are keeping afloat," Morrison-Chin said Tuesday. "We got enough take out orders and hefty pick-up orders."


  Last week Gov. Larry Hogan ordered the closing of several aspects of business, and continued tiering down this week to include "non-essential" businesses such as salons and barbershops. However it was ruled that restaurants could remain in business but with take out,, carry out or drive thru service only. Per Centers for Disease Control guidelines, no gatherings of 10 or more are allowed in Maryland. Malls, entertainment centers, horse racing facilities and theaters were ordered closed. Almost all government offices are operating remotely as are other businesses deemed essential.

Out of context, this might look like a trite metaphor for personal liberation. Yet the scene operates on so many other levels as to become not only specific, but also legitimately profound. Half an hour into the riveting four-part series, filmed in Yiddish and English and due out on March 26, the baggage Esty brings to this adventure with her peers, all students at the local conservatory, is substantial. She comes across as somehow both older and younger than them; a 19-year-old wife on the run, casting off the modest clothing and stiff, brown wig that render her identical to Williamsburg neighbors three times her age, she's just begun to exercise the bodily autonomy that these other women have always taken for granted. Esty's fixation on a past atrocity, an obsession that the show perceptively frames as the defining trait of ultra-Orthodox Jewish culture, sharply contrasts with the students' focus on the present. She isn't just celebrating her newfound freedom--she's rejecting a worldview that would, in its very conservatism, prevent her from moving forward in life.

Note that Walmart (and the other companies doing much the same thing) aren't hiring more permanent staff, they're hiring temps. Some of whom will graduate through into long term positions sure, but the managements know this is a short term phenomenon. We should too.


  Don't be tempted to jump into a retail investment just because sales are booming. Because sales will reverse soon enough. This is not a long term change in volumes, margins or profits, it's a short term blip that will make very little difference in the long run.


  Thus it's all interesting to observe but the effect upon stocks in the grocery sector is going to be minimal to nothing in the time scales that we work upon.


  As an investment factor ignore it. Even though we will see a jump in Q1 earnings as a result of it all, this will reverse in Q2. And the important point, the major investors in the market know this too.

CALGARY - While children appear to be better at fighting off the novel coronavirus than adults, little is known about how COVID-19 affects them and the best treatment for kids who are infected, says a Calgary researcher who hopes to fill in some of those blanks with a new global study spearheaded at Alberta Children's Hospital.


  Dr. Stephen Freedman, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and a clinician-scientist in the University of Calgary's Cumming School of Medicine was already working with an international group of scientists on pediatric pneumonia.


  When COVID-19 hit the headlines, he decided to switch gears and focus on the novel respiratory disease.

The end of the winter sports season was canceled, the start of the spring sports season has been delayed, but Mike Fowler never envisioned that the COVID-19 pandemic would already cancel plans for the middle of August and crush the dreams of his Seacoast Storm youth baseball team.


   


  Cooperstown Dreams Park, located five miles from the Baseball Hall of Fame in downtown Cooperstown, N.Y., hosts weekly 12-year-old, 104-team tournaments from the beginning of June through the end of August.


   


  Teams from all over the country arrive every Friday during the summer months, and play six pool play games before single-elimination begins on Tuesday and runs until Thursday's championship game.


   


  Cooperstown Dreams Park informed all 1,352 registered teams late Friday night that it was canceling the entire summer.


   


  "In the best interest of our country, state, local community, local partners, coaches, umpires and most importantly, our employees, players and their families, whose health and safety we are obligated to protect, Cooperstown Dreams Park has determined it is necessary to cancel the 2020 season," the press release said in part. "Cooperstown Dreams Park was hoping to avoid this outcome, but it is the only responsible course of action. Like the rest of the nation, we have never experienced anything like this. We know our staff will be resilient and steadfast in its preparation for the 2021 season and that once again the joyous sounds of kids playing the game of baseball at Cooperstown Dreams Park will be heard."


   


  The Seacoast Storm, composed of kids from the Seacoast Cal Ripken League, were scheduled to play in the 11th week of the season, starting Aug. 15. The team had raised just over $10,000 so far for tournament expenses.


   


  "I had a hunch the early tournaments would be jeopardy, but I was a little surprised to hear that they canceled the entire season already," said Fowler, the head coach of Storm. "We were certainly disappointed, no question about it. But given what's going on in the world, it certainly is understandable in regards to the decision they made. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to see my team because of where we are in the health situation, and I'm not sure the next time we will be able to get together. But this is a bitter pill for all the families I am sure."


   


  Seacoast United was scheduled to send three teams in the final week of the summer, starting Aug. 28. Thaao Papakonstantis is a seventh-grade student at Cooperative Middle School in Stratham and was on one of those teams.


   


  "It seemed like this was a bit premature, but again, we don't understand the planning and what goes into these decisions," said Thaao's dad, Niko Papakonstantis. "It's unfortunate, but that is what we're dealing with right now, and part of the crisis we're dealing with."


   


  Papakonstatis said his son took the news in stride.


   


  "He was really looking forward to it," Niko said. "He said he understood, but you look in the eye of a 12-year-old boy and we saw the devastation."


   


  Roger Allen Baseball, based out of Rochester, was scheduled to compete the week of July 25, Week 8.


   


  "It's awful," Roger Allen head coach Jason Bushway said. "We're trying to spin this into a positive. We let the kids know that this is out of hands, and this is not only for their best health, but the public in general. We don't know when or where, but we're still going to do something for these kids."


   


  Roger Allen started fundraising last August and had raised about $26,000 for tournament expenses.


   


  Fowler, who had never been to Dreams Park, said he was looking forward to the overall experience.


   


  "The team was going to be treated basically as professional baseball players," Fowler said. "They had two uniforms that would be laundered; they would have played on professionally graded fields, and been playing competition from across the country. Many of these kids have been playing since they were 7 or 8 years old; this would have been a great way to end their careers. When all this is said and done, regardless of Cooperstown, I just hope all kids from ages 4 to 18 have an opportunity to play something this summer, and just to get some normalcy."

You can hear the frustration in her voice.


  Jo Anne Conway just wants to be able to get on a plane and fly from Lima, Peru to her hometown of Sault Ste. Marie.


  Conway, and her 16-year-old daughter Connie Stephenson found themselves on an unintentional, extended vacation when Peru shut down its borders last week, leaving them stuck in the San Miguel district, about 15 minutes away from the international airport.


  The federal government announced that it will be sending three planes to Peru to pick up stranded Canadians and that the arrangements have been worked out between the governments.


  The first plane was to depart Tuesday but is fully booked, Conway said in a telephone interview.


  "We were told we need to sit and wait for an email from global affairs and we will get an email if we are selected for one of the next flights,” she said. Those flights are tentatively set for Thursday and Friday.


  Conway did exactly what she was suppose to do before leaving for vacation. She registered with the federal government. Contact with MP Terry Sheehan’s office confirms that the information is “in the system” and government knows where she is.


  "We don’t know too much about how they are selecting people but we assume they are prioritizing Canadians like the elderly, and maybe people with young children,” Conway said. “But we really don’t know for sure because we’re not getting a whole lot of information.”


  Sheehan said there are "many" Canadians still out of the country and trying to return home, with the most being in the United States. His office has been busy helping many, he said.


  "Our borders will always be open to Canadians who want to return home," he said. "We are continuing to assist the many, many people who are still outside of our country."


  Sheehan said his staff has been providing instructions and information to constituents who have requested hep and will continue to do so.  A federal government emergency fund is available to repatriate Canadians or keep them safe abroad.


  Conway wants to make sure she’s by her phone when the email arrives. She’s heard that the flights are on a “first come, first serve” basis and that an email will give a “code” that needs to be entered to try to get on a flight. She’s also heard that Canadians are having difficulty with those codes and getting into the system.


  And to make matters worse, despite the fact Conway had return flights for her and her daughter, she knows she will be required to purchase new ones, at about $1,400 each.


  "I’m really hoping the federal government will give us that money back. After all, we had purchased flights that we couldn’t use,” she said.


  She also fears the email will come in the middle of the night when she is asleep and she will miss her opportunity to get on a flight.


  "We had one email come in at 2 a.m. I had my volume on but I was sleeping and didn’t hear it,” she said.


  Conway said there are some Canadians that are currently in very remote areas of Peru, others with animals and are being told they have to leave their pets behind.


  "If they prioritize the elderly and small children first, then I can wait, but just get all of us home and give us some clarity so we know what is going on. It’s a little scary and frustrating,” she said.


  Conway and Stephenson remain in her Air B&B apartment and have paid for it until March 30. A pair of 19-year-old men from Holland remain in their apartment across the hallway, also waiting to get home.


  "My daughter and the Holland boys are hanging out and keeping upbeat,” she said. “I have found myself on a roller coaster. Sometimes I’m ok and then I find myself dwindling. There are a lot of ups and downs but I’m just trying to stay positive for them.”


  Conway said they are safe, healthy and have plenty of food.


  It’s been difficult adapting to martial law in a foreign country, she said.


  Martial law is a state when military controls normal civilian functions for a government during times of emergency.


  "There are different rules all the time and you just don’t know what’s ok to do and what’s not. It changes all the time and it’s scary, even when you have to go down the block to the grocery store,” she said.


  In addition, Conway says she’s white and she’s a foreigner and the situation can be unnerving.


  "Now we’re seeing actual tanks on the road,” she said. “There are times when my stomach just turns. This is so new and so different to us and we really don’t know what to expect.”


  Conway has maintained daily contact with family in Sault Ste. Marie who are advocating on her behalf.


  "I’m just thankful that my daughter has these boys to hang our with and keep upbeat right now,” she said.


  On Monday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government is working with Air Canada to send three flights to Peru, two to Morocco and another to Spain. Air Transat will also send two flights to Honduras and one each to Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala to get Canadians home.


  Last week the Peruvian government sealed its borders for at least 15 days in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19 but has continued to work with countries to get their citizens home. The virus has spread in Peru and more extreme measures, including martial law, have come into effect.


  Global Affairs Canada says 4,300 Canadians are registered to be living in Peru and Trudeau has said not everyone will be able to come home on the flights.


  In the meantime, Conway and Stephenson wait.


  All international flights are being rerouted to Montreal, Toronto, Calgary or Vancouver to help contain exposure and facilitate a screening process. Anyone Canadian who is sick and abroad, will not be permitted to board a plane. All Canadians returning from outside the country are required to self-isolate for 14 days.
