One of the most famous members of the Coordination Council is the Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich. Long persecuted by Lukashenko’s government, she spent a decade in exile before returning to Belarus in 2011. She urged Lukashenko to “leave before it’s too late” in a recent interview with Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe. Yet Alexievich’s magnum opus, _Second Hand Time_ , an oral history of the fall of the Soviet Union and its aftermath, is a testament to the trauma and disillusionment of hasty transitions. Over and over, her interview subjects speak of how their idealistic yearning for change was dashed by the realities of corrupt politics and untrammeled capitalism. “We thought that any minute now…there were buses idling outside waiting to take us away to democracy,” one person tells Alexievich in the book. As another recounts, when people went out into the streets in 1991, it was “to die for freedom, not capitalism,” adding, “I consider myself a person who’s been deceived.”

Custer explained that Narcan reverses the effects of an opioid overdose and is used to save lives. When an individual picks it up, instructions are given on how to use it and what to do to help the person in need of it. In addition, information is given about treatment services and where to get help for addiction.
 “The sheriff’s office reported that since January there have been 19 overdoses in our county, and some of those overdoses have been fenantyl, methamphetamine, heroin and then some are pending,” Custer said. “But for 10 of those overdoses, Narcan was given to the individual. And 12 of them were hospitalized, and four of them were fatalities.”
 Custer noted that many times people don’t have Narcan is available.
 “So that’s our whole purpose is to try and reach out to the communities and make it more available to people so that if it’s needed, it’s in the hands of people that can give it,” she said.
 Mayor Richard Carlson stated that he hopes people won’t think that if they have Narcan, it is OK to take a drug because somebody can bring them out of an overdose.
 “We don’t want that, either,” he said.
 Custer agreed, stating that the heath department does not want to enable people.
 “But at the same time, if we know someone is using drugs, we wouldn’t want to lose a life, either,” she said. “I know there has been one here in our community not too long ago. Sometimes other people overdose too. It could be an elderly person who forgets they took medicine and takes it again and that sort of thing ... we still like to have it in the hands of people that can use it.”
 She explained that as with any addiction, it’s not always a choice.
 “It may be a choice to use it the first time, but it is a disease, and if they don’t seek help, then it might be the only saving grace for them,” Custer said.
 She also noted that if someone uses Narcan in cases that are not overdoses, it will not harm them.

On the court, after notching 20 wins in its previous campaign, Prestonsburg faced some adversity during the 2019/2020 girls’ high school basketball season.
 But the Lady Blackcats battled throughout the latest hoops campaign. Prior to falling in the 2019/2020 58th District Girls’ Basketball Tournament semifinals, Prestonsburg won five of its last eight regular-season games. Prestonsburg’s 2019/2020 season included a win over 14th Region champion Letcher Central.
 Brandon Kidd-coached Prestonsburg is expected to be an improved team in the upcoming hoops campaign.
 “I’m also very excited about this basketball season,” Kidd confided. “I hope we get the opportunity to play the season because we have a great group of young ladies that have really put the work in. Our seniors deserve this season to finish the way they want to.”
 Kidd is focused on making positive impacts both on and off the court. His role as an assistant principal will help him continue to make positive impacts off the court.
 “I’m blessed beyond measure,” Kidd commented. “God has been great to me and I’m thankful for everyone that has made this happen.”

Jennifer Mancini knows there's a lot to consider in getting a film off the ground in these current times.
 But the president of the Toronto-based film and TV production company Mythic Trips Entertainment says they absolutely want to come back to North Bay.
 "We worked continuously despite COVID, despite everything that was going on, very dedicatedly, and here I was face-to-face with reopening and we're ready to go," she said.
 Her upcoming supernatural horror-thriller "Flee The Light," a story Mancini describes as a spiritual search gone wrong, is set to begin filming this fall in the North Bay area, making it among the first productions to get started back up in the city since the province declared its state of emergency in March in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The production, which will feature the executive producers of the 2015 period supernatural horror film "The Witch," is something Mancini says they have been working hard to get out the door.
 Despite the pandemic, she says they were still able to persevere through COVID, working from home and not travelling, as well as securing grants and tax credits in order to finance the project.
 "Obviously you have a huge amount to budget for that you never had to think about before, like PPE (personal protective equipment), sanitizing stations, cleaning, more personnel, more time for people to clean and all of that," she said.
 "But if that's what you need to do that's what you need to do, otherwise you don't film and you don't work and nothing happens, and we decided, like I said, to jump in and do it and do it safely."
 A running list from Cultural Industries Ontario North, a non-profit organization serving the region's music, film and television sectors, has four upcoming productions scheduled in Northern Ontario as of Monday.
 Of those, two are set to take place in North Bay, including "Flee The Light" and the Hallmark TV movie "Too Close For Christmas," which is set to begin principal photography Monday.
 City officials held a media availability at city hall Thursday to officially welcome the film and television industry back to North Bay, with Coun. Johanne Brousseau saying she has always been proud of how welcoming and supportive the community has been.
 "Now, with filming resuming, we ask residents to continue to support, while being mindful that the film set is an active work site," she said, adding residents are advised to check safety protocols and always wear a face covering while on a film set.
 The city also shared details on the economic impact the industry had in North Bay last year, statistics which were expected to be released in March but were delayed due to the pandemic.
 In 2019, a total of 15 productions were filmed in North Bay resulting in 377 filming days, 264 different locations and an estimated 16,000-plus branded hotel overnight stays, altogether generating more than $46 million in local spending, including on wages, construction, rentals, locations and accommodations.
 This is compared to 2018, when the city saw 177 film days, 140 locations used and $13 million in direct spending.
 As pleased as they were about last year's numbers, McDonald said they also have to be realistic when it comes to 2020, which he expects will be significantly different depending on how many productions get up and running.
 McDonald said it may take a couple of cycles to return to pre-COVID levels, although he expects the industry to rebound locally.
 "As long as everybody's following the protocols, we're very confident that the film industry and the television industry can carry out their productions," he said.
 McDonald also credited city economic development officer Tanya Bedard for championing film and television in the community, adding that on top of the city not charging fees for film permits, a benefit to filming in North Bay is crews can get around the city in a very short period of time.
 Mancini also highlighted Bedard's work for making filming in North Bay easy to do.
 She said along with it being fun to work in the city, she finds there also is a real sense of community.
 "You can't buy that with money," Mancini said. "It's just the people and the spirit."

Like a dog chasing a car, I don't think Epic Games really knew what it was doing when it decided to go to war with Apple and Google last week.
 It all started Aug. 13 when Epic Games, the developer and publisher of the insanely popular game "Fortnite," announced they would start offering a permanent 20% discount on "Fortnite's" in-game currency if the player would buy directly from Epic rather than the Apple or Google app stores.
 Apple and Google, who both collect a 30% fee on all in-app purchases immediately balked at this and pulled the game from their stories.
 Epic Games expected that and lawsuits against Apple and Google were already written waiting to be filed as soon as the game had been pulled from the app stores. Epic even released a video to go along with the lawsuit that is a parody of Apple's "1984" Super Bowl commercial, but this time casting Apple in the villain role instead of IBM.
 "Apple's removal of 'Fortnite' is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100% monopoly over the iOS in-app payment processing market," Epic said in its complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
 Epic is clearly trying to sway public opinion that they're good guys looking out for consumers while Apple and Google are just trying to milk hardworking companies by taking exorbitant fees on purchases made on their app stores.
 While Epic was expecting "Fortnite" to get pulled from the app stories, I don't think they were expecting the continued escalation of the fight this week.
 On Aug. 24, Apple announced it had plans to revoke Epic Games' software development capabilities for all Apple products on Aug. 28, making Epic Games' popular Unreal Engine, used to make games, movies/television shows, theme park attractions and other industries, incompatible with any Apple product.
 Epic Games filed a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order against Apple on Aug. 24 that would prevent "Fortnite" from being removed from the iOS app store and keep the Unreal Engine from being incompatible with Apple hardware.
 As a creator and lover of all kinds of media, I absolutely believe that all content creators should be given a fair payment for their work.
 But I also believe in fair business. Since the safer at home recommendations started in mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, my wife and I have been rewatching the classic CBS drama "Dallas." Signing a contract agreeing to split the proceeds 70/30 and then finding a way to cheat the system after you've become successful so you don't have to pay your partner sounds like something J.R. Ewing would have taken pleasure in 40 years ago. And if your business model is something J.R. Ewing would approve of, it's probably not entirely on the up and up.

“And if enough of you don’t follow the rules, game over,” Robel said in the email. “We’ll have to do what other universities have done and go all online.”
 Carney said university officials will investigate any reports of gatherings that violate rules and regulations regarding COVID-19 safety.
 "If we're here to do what students and others told us they want to do — in- person classes, providing an on-campus experience — our students have to do the right thing," he said.
 Most of the time, that seems to be happening. Carney said he has seen people wearing masks and following social distancing recommendations during the day when he has walked around campus.
 But students still need to follow those guidelines when they're off campus after the sun goes down, Carney said.
 "This is not like any other time students have experienced," he said. "That's just the reality."
 All of this caught the attention of IU President Michael McRobbie, who sent out a system-wide email Thursday afternoon.
 "Right now, there are people on social media posting about how irresponsible students are going to force us all back online," he said in the email. "They think it is inevitable. Prove them wrong."
