Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, has been stealing the spotlight from EVs and renewables lately. From a sort of boutique car fuel a couple of decades ago, hydrogen has evolved into one of the clean energy priorities for the future. And this future may be quite bright for it as prices for its production from renewable sources of energy are set to halve. A study commissioned by the International Council on Clean Transportation has found that the average price for a kilo of hydrogen produced through electrolysis using solar or wind power will fall by about 50 percent between 2020 and 2050 in the United States and Europe.


  The stuffy examines three scenarios based on whether the electrolyzer--the installation that breaks down water into hydrogen and oxygen--is connected to the grid, to a renewable electricity generator, or is grid-connected but serves as a storage facility. It also looks into three renewable power generation technologies, including utility-scale solar, onshore wind, and offshore wind.


  The results from this research are certainly encouraging for companies seeking to make hydrogen the next dominant fuel. And it's not just companies. None other than the European Union has devised a whole hydrogen strategy for its future, focusing precisely on green hydrogen, as opposed to so-called blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas, and gray hydrogen, produced from coal.


  The EU has stated that hydrogen will have a leading part to play in decarbonizing transport and manufacturing. It has plans to build at least 40 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030, with 6 GW of these to be up and running by 2024. The news of lower green hydrogen prices must have been a reason for celebration in Brussels.

It has plans to build at least 40 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030, with 6 GW of these to be up and running by 2024. The news of lower green hydrogen prices must have been a reason for celebration in Brussels. Related Is The OPEC Alliance Coming To An End However, it's worth noting that in its focus on green hydrogen, Europe will be spending a lot of money to ensure emission-free hydrogen production rather than using blue hydrogen production, the kind that involves natural gas and the kind which is a lot cheaper than even the future prices of green hydrogen. Consider this. According to the ICCT-commissioned study, the price per kilo of hydrogen produced at a grid-connected hydrolyzer is currently $8.81. This will fall to $5.77 per kilo by 2050. But the price per kilo of blue hydrogen, produced through carbon capture and storage, is currently $2.36 2 euro, according to the EU's hydrogen strategy. Also according to this strategy, the price of green hydrogen varies between $2.95 and $6.49 per kilo 2.5-5.5 euro. Both studies note that prices are location-sensitive, so they actually vary greatly from place to place. And there is more. The prices calculated in the ICTT-commissioned study do not include the price of building a hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. The EU's strategy envisages what Oxford Energy calls a pragmatic approach building transport infrastructure around the biggest users of hydrogen in clusters initially and only eventually expanding it across the continent. In parts of the continent, hydrogen will be transported via pipelines formerly used for natural gas. Now, being pragmatic certainly tends to save money. But the EU, if not the U.S., has been giving the impression that pragmatism is not its priority. Cutting emissions is. This will require a lot of money. Incidentally, it will also require a lot of hydrogen projects. As Oxford Energy notes in an analysis of the EU strategy, there are just 4.5 GW of green hydrogen projects under development. If the EU wants to hit its own target, it would need some 20-30 GW of projects in the pipeline, so it could approve 20 to 30 percent of them. And then there is hydrogen's future as a vehicle fuel. Currently, hydrogen cars are a tiny minority, and this is because they are even more expensive than some EVs. Hydrogen can be used for electricity generation, and this is what the EU likely plans to use it for primarily. But if plans get even more ambitious and hydrogen fuel cell tech becomes cheaper for cars, then plans will need to be made for filling station networks. And a lot of storage space, which is a special kind of storage space because hydrogen is highly flammable. Special in this context means expensive. And this means that the falling cost of electrolysis using solar and wind power is good news, but we have yet to see if it is good enough news for the hydrogen lobby. Meanwhile, utilities and oil supermajors are expanding in the hydrogen space. This is where the biggest chance for success is for clean hydrogen in the private sector. Governments can draft all the strategies they want but without investments from the private sector--and the energy generation know-how the utilities and the supermajors have--all these strategies would be doomed. So the fact that competition is intensifying in the hydrogen space between supermajors and utilities may turn out to be a lot better news than the falling costs of green electrolysis.

Zac Efron has found his way into a Disney+ Original at last. Monday afternoon, reports surfaced (via _THR_) suggesting the _Baywatch_ star had been cast in a _Three Men and a Baby_ reboot for the Disney-owned streamer. Efron's the first star attached to the product being crafted by Disney's live- action film division solely for Disney+. Gordon Gray -- a collaborator with Ben Affleck on _The Way Back_ -- is producing.


  The original feature initially hit theaters in 1987 and starred Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, and Steve Guttenberg. The Leonard Nimoy feature went on to become the first-ever Disney live-action film to make over $100 million at the domestic box office. The commercial success led to a sequel three years later titled _Three Men and a Little Lady._ Nimoy wasn't part of the sequel.


  The remake has a script from Will Reichel ( _Hot Air_ ) and is actively searching for a director.


   _Three Men and a Baby_ is just the next reboot in line for an ever-expanding library of original content on Disney+. Earlier this month, the House of Mouse announced _Mulan_would be going to the service as a premium on-demand offering alongside a limited theatrical release.


  "Clearly, the original shows that we decided to invest in, led by _The Mandalorian_ , have worked," former Disney chief Bob Iger said about Disney's original content earlier this year. "We knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming and that it would build over time. So as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with volume ... I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working."

  After a career launched by Disney thanks to his involvement in the _High School Musical_ franchise, Efron has appeared in indie hits such as _The Beach Bum_ and _Extremely Wick, Shockingly Evil and Vile._ He's currently starring in Netflix's _Down to Earth,_ a docuseries showcasing the actor has he traverses the planet in search of sustainability. Efron currently produces the series under his own production banner. The synopsis for the show reads, "In this travel show, actor Zac Efron journeys around the world with wellness expert Darin Olien in search of healthy, sustainable ways to live."

"Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain."
   
 -- Lily Tomlin
   
 If there's one thing worse than a drinking man, it's an angry drinking man.
   
 I'm guilty on both counts.
   
 The drink is Tab. It's my brand, my favorite, my go-to beverage when I need to write, relax, refresh or just hear that bubbling-brook sound of a top being popped.
   
 "Aahhh ...."
   
 Coffee might get me started in the morning, but after a couple of cups, I lose interest. Iced tea is OK. It goes well with picnicky plates of fried chicken and potato salad, but the sugar levels vary so much.
   
 Water?
   
 Well, as W.C. Fields once noted, "Fish do some pretty disgusting things in it."
   
 I'll take Tab.
   
 Coca-Cola invented it back in the '60s as a diet drink. Its rare taste, admittedly acquired, has been often described as "metallic."
   
 Some attribute this to its artificial sweetener saccharin, which became an alarming concern years ago when our government "experts" announced it was dangerous to lab rats. Tab was tattooed with a warning label.
   
 Like most Tab-totalers, I laugh at danger. I also laughed at the "experts" when they had to admit a decade ago they had "followed the science" down the wrong rat-hole and their conclusions were mistaken.
   
 The warning label was removed  and Tab tops were popped across America in celebration, an inordinate number of them -- journalists.
   
 The late Southern newspaper columnist Lewis Grizzard was a Tab man. So was Van Gordon Sauter, president of CBS News in the 1980s. Steven Brill, not only a brilliant reporter, but also an Atlanta newspaper magnate, was known to manfully crush his Tab can after draining its contents.
   
 In The Chronicle newsroom, both yours truly and Damon Cline, our business editor, have been known to sip a can of news nectar at the end of the day while discussing junkyard car parts and political poltroons.
   
 "Aahh ..."
   
 I tell you all that to explain the "angry" part.
   
 For the past few weeks, the grocery store chains have been "out" of Tab. Could it be the end?
   
 I had to know, so I barged into the nearest Publix, tracked down the manager and demanded details on Tab's demise.
   
 He assured me the empty shelf was temporary, another Covid casualty, as big- name brands, such as Coca-Cola, focus on core products.
   
 "Lays is doing it with potato chips," he said, "and Campbell's doing it with soup."
   
 We'll see.
   
 I always recycle my Tab cans each month, tossing a full garbage bag into the Firehouse No. 10 bin on Alexander.
   
 Right now I'm down to my last 12-pack, and I'm thinking I'll save it.
   
 If Tab's gone, I'll have the memory.
   
 If it returns, I'll need it to celebrate.
   
 "Aahh ..."

Western Europe's largest oil producer, Norway, which is not officially part of the OPEC+ coalition, is cutting its oil production because of the slump in demand and prices and is likely to help reduce the Atlantic basin supply of several oil producers to the lowest since early 2012, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing oil shipment plans it had seen.


  Norwegian oil loadings in September are set to drop by 261,000 barrels per day (bpd) month over month, with reduced loadings from the giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield accounting for two-thirds of those reduced volumes, according to Bloomberg estimates.  

  While it was not immediately clear if Norway's production cuts of 250,000 bpd in June and 134,000 bpd in the second half of 2020 were the primary reason for the significantly lower Norwegian oil loadings for September, it was expected that Johan Sverdrup would see reduced production because of the government's plan.

LIVE BLOG: Hanna downgraded to a tropical depression

This week's artifact brings to mind the halcyon days from the summers of our youth. To a child -- and let's face it, many adults as well -- a dish or cone of cold, creamy, delicious ice cream can seem like a special treat on a broiling hot day, and unless you are going to the nearest chain ice cream shop, you are going to need something similar to our artifact to get it out of the carton.
   
 Our records don't record the age of our artifact, but this style was patented in 1876 and was manufactured until the 1940s. Unfortunately, we also don't know who donated it, but the general consensus is it was associated with one of the local ice cream parlors.
   
 It seems like almost every village, town and city has someplace that sold ice cream, and failing that, there was always the homemade version. Believe it or not, an ice cream-like food was invented in China some 2,200 years ago. A mixture of milk and rice was packed with snow and mixed well, although it is unclear how it tasted. At first, sticks or paddles were used to serve ice cream, but they were messy at best. It wasn't until 1897, when a gentleman by the name of Alfred L. Cralle invented the lever-action dipper. The idea was the person dispensing the ice cream would get a scoop full, then press the lever on the scoop. A little arm then would sweep around the inside of the bell, freeing the product from the scoop.
   
 From there, a plethora of designs, some practical and some not, hit the market. There were specialized shapes (think squares, hearts, etc), spring- loaded half-moons, paddles, and even a short-lived electric dipper from the 1920s that was intended to heat up, allowing the product to melt just enough to get it out of the dipper. Unfortunately, it tended to shock the operator while shorting out or simply overheat and then short itself out, thus rendering it useless. Many of these designs are still with us today, and can be found in just about every kitchen.
   
 Our artifact is known as a "key dipper," with the key on the back being used to turn the arms inside the bell, which would release the ice cream inside.
   
 In the late 1800s, ice-cream became popular with the masses, and ice cream parlors began to appear. Des Moines County certainly had its share of places to choose from over the years.
   
 Our artifact is not on display at this time. However, you never know. It may make an appearance at some point in the future.

The Johan Sverdrup oilfield started up production in October last year, and after ramping up production three months later, it helped Norway's production to hit a nine-year high in December 2019. However, the pandemic and the resulting demand and oil price crash had Norway's government decide to mandate an oil production cut, and that decision "has been made on an independent basis and with Norwegian interests at heart," the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy said at the end of April, after Saudi Arabia and Russia ended the oil price war and signed a new OPEC production cut pact to respond to the crisis. Now Norway could become a main contributor to the lowest oil supply from the Atlantic Basin producers - including Norway, Nigeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, and the UK - in eight years, at 5.73 million bpd in September, according to Bloomberg's estimates of loading schedules it has seen. Russia's oil loading programs from its western ports for September are yet to be announced. In terms of production, Russia said earlier this month that its oil output in July was in line with its OPEC commitment. As of August 1, the OPEC group is easing the total cut to 7.7 million bpd from 9.7 million bpd.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com

That’s a Republican senator from Nebraska that called it unconstitutional slop. What he did over the weekend, it’s not going to help small businesses, no direct aid for families, no help. In fact, it defunds the police and firefighters because there’s no help for state and local governments, and he’s delaying, not cutting taxes, if he can even do that to the Social Security trust fund. It’s not like right now older voters in America are thinking, gee, Donald, you really got our back. What does he do, he weakens the Social Security trust fund."

Living outside of town, I enjoy running in the rolling Oklahoma hills. It is a runner's paradise, especially if you are one who loves the heat and humidity of an Oklahoma summer day. However, there is one major issue: the dogs of summer. I'm not talking about the hot, sultry days. I'm talking about dogs - the animals that are supposed to be man's best friend.
 We have seen movies of the troubled boy and out of nowhere comes the loving dog ready to save the day. This previously unknown but now faithful companion is ready to protect at all costs, while being a confidant who will love you regardless, right? In my case, that seems to only exist on the back set of a Hollywood studio.
 For a runner, it is instead the perfect opportunity for these four-legged friends to chase you down for an afternoon exercise of their own. There are several running loose in our area, and Jones Road seems to be the perfect spot for strays. However, it's the ones who live in the area that cause the most mayhem for those of us trying to exercise.

Pity poor Mr. Bowlsby. When he arrived, tired and bedraggled at the editorial offices of the Burlington Gazette that morning in 1899, he had a story to tell that was all too familiar to many of the town residents.
   
 The West Hill resident had come to complain of a most uncommon rat that robbed him of his sleep, angered his wife, and made him an object of scorn with his neighbors.
   
 While the newspaper staff bustled about the room in their effort to produce the daily newspaper, Mr. Bowlsby placed his head on the editor's desk and began to pour out his tale of woe.
   
 Burlington, at that time, was plagued with rats seeking shelter from the winter. The ample food supply of uncollected garbage and grain sweepings from the nearby mills had produced a bumper crop of the rodents that summer. Now, with the arrival of cold weather, the fat and happy rats were intent on sharing living arrangements with the town's residents.
   
 Bowlsby became aware of the first signs of this invasion on the previous day when his wife loudly pointed out the gnawed holes in the baseboard of the dining room, the study and the bedroom closet.
   
 Bowlsby girded his loins and made ready to do battle with the four-footed invaders. He purchased a supply of rolled tin and closed off all the offending rat holes he could find. Thus, secure in the knowledge it would take a very inventive rat equipped with tin snips to force entry into his house, he retired to bed.
   
 But a few minutes after 10 p.m., he awoke from his slumber with the awareness he had uninvited guests. There was a persistent scratching at the wall in the dining room, study and closet. For a few minutes, Bowlsby feared a pack of rats was attempting to force an entry.
   
 "I subsequently learned they were all the same rat," Bowlsby was to report. "He was calling at all the various places where he had grown accustomed to dropping in and every time he found a place closed against him, he grew more excited.
   
 "I was already nervous when I went to bed and I had been listening to that rat gallop all around the house and cry aloud every time he found a new piece of tin on the baseboard. And then, all of a sudden, he was in bed with me!"
   
 At that point in his story, the Gazette staff paused in their rounds and drew near to Mr. Bowlsby to hear the rest of the story. Their visitor rewarded them with a blood curdling account of how he suddenly sat up in bed, with his feet hanging over the edge.
   
 "You don't know how queer to feels to put your bare feet on the floor expecting to have a creature jump upon your corns," Bowlsby explained. "Finally, I got down off the bed and turned on a light and got a piece of board out on the back porch. There I found my dog sound asleep."
   
 "The dog, being surprised out of his sleep and seeing me with the club, assumed I was going to lam him with it and I had a terrible fight getting him in the house. By the time I dragged him into the bedroom, I was in no condition to encounter a rat so I told the dog to remain on watch and I retired to the dining room."
   
 Bowlsby told of waiting for some time in the dining room, until he grew puzzled by the silence from the bed chamber. Then, slowly the awareness grew, that there was something with him sitting in the dining room. Bowlsby lit another lamp and, as the light spread, he discovered a giant rat sitting beside him.
   
 The home owner let out a shriek and ran to the bedroom to fetch his poor dog, only to discover the dog was fast asleep in the bed. He pitched the startled pooch into the dining room, then armed himself with a hatchet and took off in pursuit of the dog and rat to do battle.
   
 The chase was on. The rat ran room to room, pursued by the thoroughly alarmed dog and a shouting Bowlsby bringing up the rear. By now, the entire house was in a state of panic, while concerned neighbors pounded on the front door in fear of murder being committed inside the Bowlsby house.
   
 Finally, the dog cornered the rat in the pantry, and Bowlsby and his hatchet rushed forward to administer the coup de grace to the rascally rodent. But the dog suddenly turned to see his owner again approaching with a weapon and assumed the hatchet was meant for him.
   
 With a loud howl, the confused dog turned from the rat and fled back toward the bedroom with Bowlsby in pursuit -- intent on returning the dog to the fray -- as the bemused rat followed along -- no doubt intrigued by this sudden change in fortune.
   
 Bowlsby had reached the limits of his patience with the family pet, so he unceremoniously pitched the dog outside and returned to do battle.
   
 It would be a showdown, just the two of them, in a battle to the finish. The rat opened the duel by retreating back into the closet. Bowlsby followed.
   
 Clothes and shoes went flying, and Bowlsby's wife and children were consumed with hysteria as Bowlsby eliminated any hiding place for the rat. Finally, only a long overcoat remained. As Bowlsby reached for it, the alarmed rat jumped from a coat pocket and ran down Bowlsby's arm to disappear beneath his night shirt.
   
 Bowlsby's reaction must have been something to see. In one move, he hoisted the night shirt around his head and turned to run from the closet.
   
 But the sleeping garment blocked his vision and with a giant crash, the nearly naked Bowlsby ran full force into the bedroom's opposite wall. And there he fell senseless to floor. Now there was quiet broken only by Mrs. Bowlsby's soft sobs.
   
 As he lay there, the recovering Bowlsby grew aware he was sharing the night shirt with a now quiet lump. He arose, shook out the shirt and a very dead rat fell to the floor. It had been killed when his pursuer had smashed into the wall. The battle finally belonged to Bowlsby.
   
 A groan swept the newsroom as the reporters realized they had probably been taken in by yet another tall tale from Bowlsby. But there was that bad bruise on the visitor's head to support his version of the story. In the end, the Gazette made no pronouncement on the story's authenticity but simply printed it as Mr. Bowlsby presented it.

“Democracy is not a state. It is an act,” our late hero John Lewis exhorted from his deathbed. To confront and defeat authoritarianism, performative democracy requires all patriotic defenders of the Republic to act — and that means act effectively. We should be mindful, as Holmes wrote, that “A man who cares nothing for an ethical rule which is believed and practiced by his neighbors is likely nevertheless to care a good deal to avoid being made to pay money, and will want to keep out of jail if he can.” The power centers at every level in our constitutional system must show they mean business by pushing back and imposing costs using the full measure of their powers under the law.

  Everyone has different goals, dreams and passions; it's one of the things that makes our world so unique and interesting. As we see on the news and various social media outlets, there are many different interests and opinions on what is going on in the world today.


  For some, it can be difficult to see or be the positive in today's world. Here at Big Brothers Big Sisters of Western North Carolina in Henderson County, it is our goal to be the positive; to be the person a \"Little\" can go to seek help and understanding.


  Big Brothers Big Sisters has multiple programs that were created to fit the needs of each child that enrolls. Our program coordinator, Morgan Harris, works diligently to learn what the enrolled child's needs and wants are when recruiting and considering prospective volunteers in the community.


  As a volunteer (Big), it is our responsibility to create positive and impactful memories, to be a shoulder to lean on, and to guide our littles through many of life's obstacles.


  As Bigs, we want to inspire the children we work with by setting a positive example and providing the tools necessary to get the most out of life. Volunteering as a 'Big' isn't just rewarding for the child, but it's also gratifying for the volunteer.


  To see a smile on a child's face or know what a difference you are making in just one person's life is an incredible feeling! For some Littles a walk in the park or a trip to a local ice cream shop brightens their whole week.


  To know you have someone you can talk to and encourage along the way through life, is such a wonderful feeling that some may not ever have.


  As a Big, you are able to help with our ever growing community by helping change a child's life. It gives you the opportunity to grow and maintain strong relationships while helping a child learn and utilize their potential. It's a chance to learn more about yourself while having fun and making new experiences.


  It'll also help strengthen your interpersonal skills, challenge your ideas and perspective, and will help you see different approaches to making life decisions.


  It's no secret what positive outcomes are to be had by having a mentor growing up. Mentors are there to offer hope, guidance, encouragement, and steady support. There are multiple studies that show how a mentor increases confidence and performance as well as decreasing one's risky behaviors.


  Mentors can help improve academic performance, school attendance, graduation rates, and attitudes. Sometimes all it takes is to have one person believe in you and to tell you it's okay to try and fail in order to give that confidence boost that is needed to succeed.


  I joined the BBBS of Henderson County's Advisory Council in February of this year. I was immediately welcomed with open arms and felt the excitement of having a new member on their team.


  As we all know, 2020 has been a bit of a whirlwind, but this team has stepped up and has worked diligently creating new ideas and opportunities for Littles and Bigs.


  It has been an inspiring experience to work with this team to see how they came together while persevering through this trying time. Their passion shines bright and it shows when seeing smiles on Little's faces.


  I am extremely proud and grateful that I have the chance to be a part of an organization that puts our community's kids first.


  We are always looking for more volunteers to help our community's kids reach their full potential. Please consider joining our team.


  For more information on how you can become involved, visit our website www.bbbswnc.org or call our program coordinator Morgan Harris at 828-693-8153.


   _Candace McLaughlin serves as treasurer on the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Henderson County Advisory Council. The native Tar Heel is employed by North River Farms in Mills River. Candace is from Concord and thrilled to be in the mountains helping make a difference in children's lives with her work and volunteer contributions to BBBS._

One Power Five coach told ESPN, “Nobody wanted to be the first to do it. Now nobody will want to be the last.”
 Actually, that seems to be exactly what the ACC and the SEC want. They continue to buy time, hoping for a miracle or a sudden downturn in the current COVID spike, or a vaccine magically appearing on the market while hoping the emerging power among the players doesn’t end the sport as we know it.
 That might be happening already.
 This is what happens in a vacuum of leadership. If and when we do play football again, it might be in front of empty seats on a campus in financial ruin and the players dictating terms, not Dabo Swinney, the $9 million football coach from Clemson.
 The optics are already bad. If, in fact, the ACC decides to play football this fall despite everything going right now, the optics would be horrid.
 The current plan, which is to throw these unpaid athletes at each other in a pandemic just to see what happens, is insane. The current plan, which is to play football no matter what because schools need the money to pay for bowling alleys and fake waterfalls and doing so on the backs of the young men doing all the work, is borderline criminal.
 That’s partly what Lawrence and players across the country, were trying to get across. They want to play, but they first need someone to be in charge, to make basic decisions about how to keep them healthy and make sure their scholarships are intact in case this season is never played. Of course, there are other players who want no part of football right now. More than 30 players for The Citadel refused to participate in the first practice of the season Friday.
 While leagues dawdle and drift over schedules and six-week plans and bottom- line reasoning, a movement has begun. Colleges will rue the day they lost control of the cash cow that is football.
 You get the impression that everything about sports will change this week. You get the impression that a seismic shift in power is occurring, and universities are scared to death of going broke.
 Throughout this entire ordeal, people in and around the sport have been saying there needs to be a single voice that can make decisions and directions for the mess we’re in. And while those same people wait and bury their heads under brand-new carpets of astroturf, that voice might have just spoken.
 Trevor Lawrence, the long hair from Clemson, is at the lectern.

Georgia's citizen's arrest law -- passed in 1863, the same year Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation -- might meet its demise in the General Assembly's next session.
   
 "It's a hot button bill right now," said Rep. Carl Gilliard, D-Garden City, the lead sponsor of a measure that would repeal the law.
   
 Committee hearings continue for the bill, which has bipartisan support, and Gilliard intends for it to be one of the first bills pre-filed for the next session.
   
 The citizen's arrest law has been cited as a defense by three white men who chased down a Black jogger outside Brunswick, Ga., last February, a confrontation that ended with Ahmaud Arbery's death.
   
 George Barnhill, a prosecutor who handled the Arbery case, told Brunswick police the day after Arbery was gunned down that the men should not be charged because they did nothing wrong as they were making a citizen's arrest.
   
 The 25-year-old's death might have been swept under the rug if his mother, Wander Cooper-Jones, a former Burke County resident, hadn't continued to press authorities about the shooting.
   
 After a third prosecutor was assigned to the case and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was brought in, Travis McMichael; his father, Gregory McMichael; and William Bryan Jr. were charged with murder. Bryan told investigators that after Travis McMichael shot Arbery twice with a shotgun, he cursed the dying man and called him a racial slur.
   
 "If a group of Black men in a pickup truck chased down a 16-year-old white kid in West Lake, there would be riots," said Pete Theodocion, a veteran criminal defense attorney in the Augusta area.
   
 The citizen's arrest law was passed in 1863 to give white men in Georgia the ability to arrest runaway slaves, and "there really is no place for it now," Theodocion said.
   
 "It's an antiquated law, that's the first thing," said Keith Johnson, another attorney whose practice includes criminal defense law. The law was passed long before 911 became the way for residents to call for help.
   
 It's a bad law because it can be so easily misinterpreted and abused, Johnson said.
   
 "It's a horrible statute. You're asking for trouble," he said.
   
 There's a reason law enforcement officers undergo training and certification, Theodocion and Johnson said.
   
 The McMichaels said they suspected Arbery had been stealing in their neighborhood, although no thefts had been reported to the police in the weeks prior to the killing. Later, it was learned a Black man had entered a construction site in the neighborhood. On Feb. 23, the McMichaels saw Arbery running down the road and grabbed guns and chased after him. Bryan joined the chase, at one point allegedly striking Arbery with his truck.
   
 The citizen's arrest law refers to someone seen committing a felony. But at most, if Arbery had gone onto the construction site, it was trespassing, a misdemeanor, Johnson said.
   
 If a resident sees or suspects someone has committed a crime, he should call 911 or at most follow from a distance, District Attorney Natalie Paine said. Grabbing a gun and chasing someone down is asking for trouble, she said.
   
 "I can't see any positives," she said.
   
 There's a reason police are trained and certified, given civil protection from lawsuits and use bodycams, Paine said.
   
 "If someone's running away from a dead body with a machete or gun in his hand, that's something else," Paine said, but added that there's still no reason to play cop. "You get a tag number. You don't hold someone at gunpoint."
   
 What happened to Arbery seems similar to what happened to 17-year-old Trayvon Martin when he was visiting his father in Sanford, Fla. The evening of Feb. 26, 2012, neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman started following him, even after a 911 dispatcher told him to stop. He shot and killed Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013.
   
 The big difference between Zimmerman and the men charged with murder in Arbery's death is video, Johnson pointed out. Bryan's attorney released the cellphone video Bryan recorded in the moments before Arbery was killed.
   
 Zimmerman claimed Martin attacked him and that he shot in self-defense. Arbery was obviously just trying to get away from the armed McMichaels, Johnson said.
         
 The answer is not just ending the citizen's arrest law, said attorney Tayna Jeffords, whose practice includes criminal defense and civil right litigation.
   
 "We need to change the perception of people," she said.
   
 Through history and media, people see Black people, especially Black men, as criminal, Jeffords said.
   
 For society to change means getting to know people who are different, to learn everyone is the same inside, Jeffords said.
   
 "It starts in the home," she said.
   
 She believes a good starting point in helping people better understand each other is through taking an implicit bias test, Jeffords said.
   
 The bill to abolish the law is getting a lot of support, said Gilliard, whose brother was killed by someone taking the law into his own hands. It has the support of at least one representative from Brunswick. A letter is going out to all the mayors in Georgia asking for a proclamation supporting the bill, Gilliard said.
   
 Sen. Harold Jones, D-Augusta, said he believes the Senate will be interested in the bill and that support, as with most legislation, depends on what the bill contains. He is concerned that store owners need to have the ability to hold shoplifters. The important language is hold, not arrest, Jones said.
   
 Jones, who is a lawyer and former Richmond County State Court solicitor, said case law in Georgia says deadly force cannot be used during a citizen's arrest. For the prosecutor initially assigned to Arbery's case to claim that justification is a travesty, Jones said.

Unfortunately for _Umbrella Academy_ fans who might have enjoyed the second season, a third season of the series has yet to be confirmed by Netflix as of this writing.

If not, maybe animation is the next route to take? As for _My Hero Academia_ , the fifth season of the anime has previously been confirmed and it's currently in the works as of this writing. No official release date for the season has been set either.

Netflix is testing a Rs 349 plan in India, which would allow HD streaming on one device and doesn't support TVs. That test, being run for new subscribers, hides the Rs 500 plan by default, indicating it could replace the SD-only Rs 500 plan, becoming in effect Netflix's first price cut in the country. But the company said that it would only roll out the plan, called Mobile+, if users showed interest. The language option and the possible price cut are concessions that indicate that Netflix is getting more serious about acquiring Indian subscribers, after years of focusing only on premium subscribers who could afford to pay more, unlike Amazon Prime Video and Hotstar, whose prices have been much lower.
