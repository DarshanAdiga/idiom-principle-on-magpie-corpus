But the pace also reflects what’s perhaps a more urgent imperative for a political spouse in the age of Trump, when Biden himself has made an explicit argument that “character is on the ballot” this fall.
 Connie Schultz, who’s campaigned for her husband, Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, and wrote a book about what it’s like to be a political spouse, said Biden's and Harris’ spouses are their best messenger on that front.
 “They help humanize these people at a time when I think the public is looking at character a little bit more than they otherwise would have,” she said.
 Indeed, at the drive-in rally in Cedar Rapids this weekend, Brian Johannesen, a 32-year-old musician, said he felt it was “important to get to know the better halves of the candidates.”
 “It’s good to see the other side of the team — it gives you more confidence in who they are as people," he said.
 While their joint appearances may be helpful for the campaign, they’re also laying the groundwork for what could be a fruitful working relationship in the White House. Jill Biden had a close working and personal relationship with Michelle Obama, and the two frequently appeared at public events together and worked on veterans’ issues throughout their eight years in the White House.

However it is not believed that the two, whose lives are not in danger, were specifically targeted.
 The man mistakenly believed Charlie Hebdo's offices were still in that building and wanted to attack journalists from the magazine, according to his statement to investigators.
 One person arrested was released overnight. But as well as the main suspect eight others were still being held.
 They include his younger brother and people who lived with him at his last place of residence in northern Paris.
 Police on Sunday also detained a woman who had been living at the same residence, a judicial source said, without giving further details.
 The arrests were aimed at understanding the "environment" of the main suspect, a source close to the case said, adding: "Everything leads us to think he acted alone."An Algerian man, detained close to the scene of the attack, had also been released. His lawyer said her client had actually been "heroically" chasing the attacker.
 The attack came three weeks into a trial in Paris of suspected accomplices in the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a policewoman and a Jewish supermarket that left 17 people dead.

The unimaginable has happened -- news editor Rudi Keller is leaving the Columbia Daily Tribune after more than two decades of service to the newspaper.


   


  No, he's not retiring. He's taking a great opportunity with States Newsroom, a nonprofit network that will expand to Missouri soon to cover state government and politics. It's a beat that has always been dear to him, and now he will get to pursue it full-time.


   


  Rudi has spent 22 years of his 35-year journalism career working for the Tribune, and is very loyal to both this newspaper and this community. He has been a rock for this organization through some very turbulent times. And he has been absolutely indispensable to me as both a colleague and a friend.


   


  The good news is that Rudi's byline will continue to appear in the Tribune on a regular basis. I'm confident that he will take media coverage of Missouri state government to a new level.


   


  Calm amid chaos


   


  When I first walked into the Tribune newsroom a little over a year ago, the scene could best be described as post-apocalyptic.


   


  The newspaper was getting ready to vacate its longtime headquarters on North Fourth Street to make way for a new tenant, the Goodwill Excel Center, a tuition-free high school for adults.


   


  Stray cables hung from the ceiling. Stacks of ancient newspapers, obsolete computer equipment and disassembled cubicle materials were strewn everywhere. Old carpet was being ripped up.


   


  And there was Rudi, sitting at his desk in the center of the debris, hammering away at his keyboard in his signature staccato machine-gun style, pounding the keys "as if they owed him money," as described by Gabriela Velasquez, our digital editor.


   


  Rudi was instrumental in rebuilding the newsroom after the draconian staff cuts imposed when GateHouse bought the newspaper in 2016. I'm not sure what he thought of me at first, but we quickly warmed to each other. We've both been in the journalism business since the 1980s and share common values, as well as a passion for history.


   


  He was more than happy to help bring me up to speed. His memory is encyclopedic and unfailingly accurate. Any story, any person, any issue -- if I had a question, he knew the answer.


   


  Anyone who knows him also knows that when you ask him a question, you'd better get a cup of coffee and make yourself comfortable. His ability to talk about any topic at length is legendary. It sometimes takes a deft touch to get a word in edgewise, but his shared knowledge has been as good as gold.


   


  This week, the Tribune won the general excellence award from the Missouri Press Association for its work in 2019, competing against the largest news operations in the state. That would not have been possible without Rudi. This newspaper has always punched above its weight, and Rudi has been a big part of that.


   


  Gabriela says if you ask any of our freelancers, they will say that he is a role model and an inspiration for them as journalists. She will miss competing against him on a daily basis to come up with the worst puns.


   


  Sports editor Kevin Graeler says that if Rudi were to have one regret about leaving the Tribune, it would be that he failed to convince Kevin or I to run stories about his beloved Formula 1 racing on the front page.


   


  'He was a legend'


   


  Andy Waters, the Tribune's former general manager, first met Rudi in the 1980s, and recalled that he was a memorable character even then.


   


  "He was a legend when I was an intern," Waters said. "He was that kind of a reporter. ... He absolutely knows as much about the Missouri Legislature as the legislators down there."


   


  John Schneller, who was the city editor at the time, remembers Rudi as a tireless reporter who never gave up.


   


  "He knows how to get to the heart of the matter," Schneller said.


   


  Scott Charton moved to Jefferson City from Arkansas in 1989 to cover the legislature for the Associated Press. He met Rudi on the first day, and remembers that his soon-to-be-close friend had a bushy beard and appeared a bit disheveled.


   


  "I wondered if the guy had slept in his car," Charton said, laughing at the memory.


   


  Charton was continually amazed by Rudi's abilities as a "math savant," eating up state agency spreadsheets and repeatedly catching officials' math mistakes.


   


  One time, standing in a crowd of reporters in former Gov. John Ashcroft's office, Rudi accidentally jostled a stack of baseball bats, Charton said.


   


  "Those bats are for use ON you, not BY you," Charton recalled Ashcroft saying.


   


  Rudi was so notorious for trying to eavesdrop on closed meetings that when Ashcroft met with other politicians to talk about a tax increase for education, someone taped a sign to the door with the word RUDI!!! crossed out, Charton said.


   


  On a more recent note, UM System President and University of Missouri Chancellor Mun Choi says his first in-depth interview after arriving in Columbia was with Rudi.


   


  "I can't say that I agreed with all of his perspectives, but I appreciated the objectivity that he brought to his work," Choi said.


   


  "My favorite moments with Rudi involve his telling of historical events in Missouri and the many fascinating figures in Columbia," Choi added. "I'll miss his work at the Tribune, and I wish him great success in his new endeavor."


   


  MU spokesman Christian Basi said that he appreciates the thoroughness and dedication that Rudi puts into every story.


   


  "The Tribune is losing a journalist who has been dedicated to Columbia," Basi said. "He knows how to ask tough questions, can be a bulldog at times, and always has had a passion for his job, and during all that time, he's earned a lot of respect from his sources -- especially those of us that respond to his requests on a regular basis.


   


  "I won't say we haven't tussled or argued over a story or perspective," Basi added, "but when the story was published, I usually found myself saying 'it might not have been how I would have liked it written, but it's certainly a fair account.' I've appreciated how hard he works, and I'll miss him."


   


  'Back to where he belongs'


   


  Perhaps it's fitting that this column is running on the same page as Capitol Perspectives, by Phill Brooks.


   


  Brooks is the dean of the statehouse press corps. He has covered every governor since the late Warren Hearnes, who left office in 1973. Rudi considers him his mentor.


   


  Brooks recalls meeting Rudi for the first time in the early 1980s, when Rudi was a young University of Missouri journalism student and Brooks was a professor developing the school's first computer system.


   


  Brooks told a group of students that he needed people to try to crash the system. Rudi promptly volunteered and wreaked havoc, and the final product was much better for it.


   


  "He loves to go after things, in a huge way," Brooks said. "His adrenaline gets up."


   


  He also recalled that as a student, Rudi wrote a series of stories critical of state tax breaks for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, one of Missouri's largest newspapers. The state Supreme Court ruled against the tax breaks. The Globe-Democrat folded in 1986.


   


  "He killed the newspaper, through aggressiveness and courage," Brooks said, adding that it was an early demonstration that Rudi never plays favorites.


   


  Brooks thinks Rudi's move back to state government reporting will be an enormous benefit to all Missourians -- a sentiment shared by others whom I talked to.


   


  Newspapers in general have cut back their coverage of the state capitol, and most of the other journalists with his historical knowledge of its workings have retired.


   


  "Rudi is going back to a place that is his home, as a public policy wonk," Brooks said. "He's back to where he belongs."

 Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) officials said a goods train “moving at permissible speed” hit the elephant and her calf between Lamsakhang and Patharkhola.

 “The speed limit at the corridor is 30 kmph. A departmental inquiry has been ordered into the mishap,” an NFR spokesperson said.
 Forest officials said they had been regularly updating the NFR on the movement of elephants along the corridors and it was no different in the case of the two elephants killed.
 At Rani, one of the elephants died after its trunk touched a live wire while uprooting a bamboo. The other elephant was electrocuted while trying to save its companion.

One lesser known aspect, to the layperson, about aircraft carrier operations is that flying at sea is the acme of professional skill. You are landing on a moving platform that requires huge amount of precision and courage from the entire team that operates it. Equally important are the people who sustain an aircraft carrier. While the jet fighters are the most glamorous and visible, aircraft carriers also operate squadrons of helicopters that play a huge role in anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and surveillance. Then there are smaller helicopters for search and rescue.

LeBron James arrived in Los Angeles vowing to restore the Lakers to NBA glory, and "King James" plans to make good on that promise.
 His 38-point triple-double propelled the Lakers to victory over the Denver Nuggets in game five of the Western Conference finals and back into the NBA championship series for a record 32nd time.
 "This is what I came here for," James said. "I heard all the conversations and everything that was said about why did I decide to come to LA (that) the reason I came to LA, it was not about basketball.
 "All those conversations, just naysayers and things of that nature. I understood that, with the season I had last year and my injury, it just gave them more sticks and more wood to throw in the fire to continue to say the things that they would say about me.
 "But it never stopped my journey and never stopped my mindset and never stopped my goal."
 The Lakers were floundering when James arrived in 2018.
 They hadn't reached the NBA Finals since 2010 -- when they secured the most recent of their 16 championships.
 In the five seasons before James opted for Los Angeles as a free agent, the Lakers won the fewest games in the NBA.
 James had reached eight consecutive finals, winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013 with Miami and 2016 with Cleveland.
 But his first season didn't go according to the Hollywood script. A groin strain James suffered in December of 2018 lingered, he missed 27 games and the Lakers missed the playoffs for just the third time in his career.
 Now he's in the finals with a third team, just the fourth player to reach the championship series for a 10th time, joining Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (10) and Sam Jones (11) and Bill Russell (12) of Boston Celtics of the 1950s-60s.
 James was ready to acknowledge the moment while already looking ahead.
 "Job not done," he tweeted, having told a television interviewer as the confetti fell in the quarantine bubble in Orlando, Florida: "I've got to get it done."
 James had scored 16 points in the fourth quarter against Denver on Saturday, squashing any hopes the Nuggets harbored of mounting the kind of miraculous comebacks they produced in each of their first two playoff series.
 "You can't tell me that LeBron James is not the MVP of the league with a 38-16-10 performance tonight to lead the @Lakers to the NBA Finals!" Lakers icon Magic Johnson tweeted, reviving the debate over the award given to Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo -- whose Bucks were ousted in the Eastern Conference semi-finals by Miami.
 \- Wide shoulders -
 "My teammates said bring us home, and it's my responsibility to try to make the right plays and do the right things out on the floor to help us win ball games," he said.
 "We have a few guys on our team that have never been to the finals before. So I took that responsibility as well. And my shoulders are wide enough to carry a lot of loads."
 They have had to since he arrived in Los Angeles. James, who has never fought shy of social activism, has been vocal as protests against racial injustice and police brutality have swept across the United States this year.
 In a season turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Lakers have coped bearing the additional sadness of the death of team great Kobe Bryant, who was killed along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others in a helicopter crash in January.
 But as he sat quietly on the court amid Saturday's post-game celebrations, James was looking ahead more than he was looking back, pondering the Lakers' potential Eastern Conference foe in the finals.
 A finals against the Miami Heat would pit James against a team where he once starred, while a matchup with Boston will pit the Lakers against a Celtics team whose record of 17 NBA titles they are trying to match.
 "Boston had a few moments in my head, and Miami had a few moments in my head as well," James said. "Whoever wins that series and how challenging that's going to be.
 As he headed to the locker room with teammate Anthony Davis -- whose star- quality skills have been rewarded with a trip the finals for a first time after his years of frustration in New Orleans -- James was already counseling his teammates on exactly where they stand.
 "One step closer to the goal," he said.

The Ravens have the NFL's longest regular-season winning streak (14 games) and will try to begin 3-0 for the first time since 2016. Baltimore has also won 12 straight home games in primetime, which is also the NFL's longest active streak. The Chiefs are the defending Super Bowl champions and they've made a habit of starting fast. They were 5-0 in both 2017 and '18, and they started 4-0 last season. Though it's early, both the Ravens and Chiefs are expected to contend for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. With only the top seed in each conference receiving a bye this season, the result of this game could have playoff seeding implications down the road.

Occasional releases of dozens of prisoners over the past two years have served as gestures of good faith, stoking hopes the factions would implement what the U.N. has described as the war's "first official large-scale" exchange. The two sides committed earlier this year to swap over 1,400 detainees.


  The conflict in the Arab world's poorest country erupted in 2014, when the Iran-allied Houthis seized the capital and much of the country's north. A Saudi-led coalition, determined to restore President Abed Rabu Mansour Hadi's government, launched a military intervention months later.


  The war in Yemen has spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis, leaving millions suffering from food and medical shortages. It has killed over 100,000 people, including fighters and civilians.


  "Today is an important day for over a thousand families who can expect to welcome back their loved ones hopefully very soon," said the U.N. Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths.


  Sunday's deal came at the conclusion of a week-long meeting in Glion, Switzerland that was co-chaired by Griffiths' office and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Representatives from the Saudi-led coalition also attended, the U.N. said.


  Yemen's Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdullah al-Hadrami welcomed the deal on Twitter and called for its full implementation without delay. He said most of the prisoners the government wants released are "civilians, activists and forcibly disappeared," in addition to four top officials detained since the beginning of the war.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration's ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.


  The 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.


  TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.

ATHENS, Sept 27 (Reuters) - A male migrant died of COVID-19 on Sunday, the first reported death of an asylum seeker since the pandemic broke out in Greece in late February, a government official told Reuters.
 The 61-year-old Afghan, a father of two children, who lived at the migrant camp of Malakasa north of Athens, was treated and died at a hospital in Athens, the official said, adding that authorities were tracing his contacts.
 It was not immediately clear how long he had been at the hospital.
 The Malakasa camp, which hosts about 3,000 migrants, has been quarantined since Sept. 7 after positive tests for the new coronavirus.
 Many other migrant facilities in Greece have been sealed off or movement has been restricted to stem the spread of the virus.
 Greece has been the main gateway into the European Union for people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond. More than a million people reached its shores from Turkey in 2015-16.
 At least 110,000 people currently live in migrant facilities - 40,000 of them in overcrowded camps on five islands.
 A fire burnt to the ground a migrant camp on Greece's biggest, on island of Lesbos this month, leaving about 12,000 people stranded. Most of them have now moved to a temporary tent camp on the island.
 Greece reported 218 COVID-19 cases on Sunday and three deaths, bringing the total number of infections to 17,444 since the first case surfaced late February. (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou; editing by David Evans)

Missouri defensive backs coach Charlie Harbison will not coach against Alabama nor the team's Week 2 game on the road against Tennessee, the program confirmed prior to the Tigers' season opener Saturday.


   


  Harbison's absence is coronavirus-related. Defensive quality control assistant Grant O'Brien will take over his coaching responsibilities for both games.


   


  Nicknamed "Coach Cheese" by players and fellow coaches, Harbison came to Missouri from Appalachian State this offseason.


   


  His primary coaching responsibilities for the Tigers are with the outside linebackers and boundary safeties.


   


  Harbison has nearly three decades of college and NFL coaching experience, with previous stops coming with the Arizona Cardinals, Clemson, LSU and Saturday's opponent, Alabama.


   


  Harbison, 61, is the first coach at Missouri publicly known to miss a game or practice because of COVID-19.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Six months into Louisiana's coronavirus outbreak, disagreements over how the state should respond to the pandemic and who should make those decisions have reached a fever pitch, culminating in the centerpiece debate of a special legislative session that starts Monday. Republican lawmakers feuding with Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards over continued restrictions on business, high school and college football games, nursing home visitation and other activities want to give themselves more authority in the rulemaking — or yank the governor's emergency declaration entirely. The dispute has been simmering for months in an outgrowth of larger philosophical and political clashes between a majority-Republican Legislature asserting its independence and a Democratic governor who won statewide reelection last year to his second term. GOP legislators say they are hearing louder complaints from Louisiana residents who are tiring of Edwards' virus response and limitations on their daily lives. Edwards says he's balancing economic and public health interests to combat the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people in Louisiana. His decisions are backed by the White House coronavirus task force and other public health experts. The arguments over science, executive power, legislative authority and personal freedom will come to a head in the 30-day special session. Legislative leaders say they have other priorities for the special session, too, including efforts to try to shore up the state's nearly bankrupt unemployment trust fund and response to the devastation of Hurricane Laura. But the top three items on the petition convening the session and setting its agenda involve the scope of powers in a state emergency, and scattered throughout the 70-item agenda are...

“There is a known divide in this city,” said longtime resident Felicia Garr, who works in construction. “Go west and the economic development ends. It’s all churches, Dollar Generals and liquor stores. Head east and it’s all coffee shops and fancy, healthy grocery stores.”


  Garr, 52, who has a daughter around the same age Taylor was, said she was devastated by last week’s legal announcement.


  “I am shocked, saddened, hurt, you name it, that nothing has happened,” Garr said. “No respect for our community.”


  In March, officers stormed into Taylor’s apartment at night and fired multiple times after her boyfriend, who did not know who was entering the home, shot and wounded one of the officers. (Several neighbors present the night of the killing have said that, although they heard loud pounding, they did not hear the officers announce themselves.)


  Soon, Taylor’s name and image were painted on billboards and walls across the nation, and here in Louisville, protesters marched through the streets night after night chanting her name and demanding that criminal charges be brought against the officers.


  But the local grand jury declined to hold any of the officers legally responsible for Taylor’s killing. One officer, since dismissed, was charged with wanton endangerment for firing rounds that struck neighboring apartments — a legal determination, critics say, that served as a further insult to the value of Taylor’s life.


  “It follows a pattern of the blatant disrespect and marginalization of Black people,” said civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Taylor’s family. “But especially Black women in America.”

"Especially at this time, during the difficult economic situation caused by the corona crisis, good relations with our neighbors and with the EU are important," Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said, welcoming the outcome of the vote.


  She said Switzerland would continue to pursue a "bilateral path" with the EU, eschewing membership of the bloc while seeking close economic ties with it.


  In a nod to the misgivings many Swiss have about the country's big neighbor, Keller-Sutter acknowledged that "freedom of movement doesn't just have benefits."


  "The Federal Council only wants as much immigration as necessary," she said. "That continues to be our goal."


  Roughly 1.4 million EU citizens live in the country of about 8.6 million, while around 500,000 Swiss live in EU countries. Some are dual citizens and wouldn't have been affected by any restrictions.


  In a similar referendum in 2014, the Swiss narrowly voted in favor of limiting EU citizens' freedom to live and work in Switzerland. Lawmakers, however, refused to fully implement that referendum fearing a hefty impact on Swiss society and businesses, prompting the People's Party to get the issue back on the ballot again this year.


  Since the last vote, Switzerland has witnessed the turmoil that Britain's 2016 referendum to leave the European Union has caused, especially for EU citizens in the U.K. and Britons living on the continent. Britain left the EU in January, but is in a transition period until the end of the year with prospects for a deal on future relations between London and Brussels still uncertain.

The film is in the works at Warner Bros., although the popular Steve Martin-starring version was produced by Disney's Touchstone Pictures. The news of another version surfaced the same week Netflix released a reunion for the 1991 film, with Martin, Diane Keaton, Kiernan Culkin, and Kimberly Williams-Paisley taking part to raise funds for World Central Kitchen.
 Warner Bros. reportedly hired Matt Lopez to write the new script, sources told _Collider_. Lopez's credits include the family films _Bedtime Stories_ , _Race to Witch Mountain_ , and _The Sorcerer's Apprentice_. Lopez's script will reportedly change up the familiar Father of the Bride plot to differentiate it from the first two versions.
  _Father of the Bride_ was first filmed in 1950 at MGM, with Spencer Tracy as the father who is not ready to see his daughter, played by Elizabeth Taylor, get married. It was based on a 1949 novel by Edward Streeter and followed by a sequel, _Father's Little Dividend_ , in 1951. In 1991, Disney released the popular remake, featuring Martin as the father, Keaton as his wife, and Williams-Paisley as his daughter. In 1995, _Father of the Bride Part II_ hit theaters and followed the same plot as _Father's Little Dividend_. The Martin films were written by Nancy Meyers and Charlies Shyer, who also directed both.
 The new _Father of the Bride_ is set up at Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the 1950 MGM movie. It's not clear what this means for Disney's own plans with the franchise. Back in 2018, _The Hollywood Reporter_ reported that a _Father of the Bride_ reboot was a top priority for the Disney+ streaming outlet.

 Back on Friday, Netflix released a virtual _Father of the Bride_ reunion on YouTube and Facebook as a fundraiser for World Central Kitchen. Martin, Williams-Pasley, Keaton, Kiernan Culkin, George Newbern, and Marin Short all returned to reprise their roles. Rober De Niro, Alexandra Shipp, Ben Platt, and Florence Pugh also joined in as new characters, while Reese Witherspoon introduced the special, reports _Variety_.
 Lopez is an experienced screenwriter for family films. He recently adapted Drew Daywalt's book _The Day the Crayons Quit_ for Shawn Levy's production banner and worked on a film adaptation of the _Asteroids_ video game. Lopez also worked for Disney on Nicholas Cage's _The Sorcerer's Apprentice_ and the Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson-starring movie _Race to Witch Mountain_. He also created _Gone_ , a 2017 series starring Chris Noth and Danny Pino.

Exhibiting what Baker christened a ‘second-stage rancio’, this 1885 Cognac has a huge depth to it that begins on the nose, which in stately, unhurried fashion reveals a leathery-smoky richness with dark molasses notes, toasted nuts and baked cherry pastry sweetness with a grating of very dark chocolate. All of this is replicated on the palate, which erupts with huge vitality and vigour that make a mockery of this distinguished spirit’s tremendous age – and also explain its longevity! There is complexity and nuance in abundance, in turn revealing those molasses, nuts and figs, but also fragrant spices and sandalwood, baked damsons and black cherries, tobacco leaf, even notes of truffle and black treacle, though right at the end, through all the rancio and dark flavours, there is a little uplift of baked apple and pear skin. The smokiness and dark spice linger long as a reminder on the after-palate.

Three years after taking to Hutchinson's streets in a little red food truck, entrepreneur Gina Emel plans to open a regular storefront location next week.


   


  "If you'd asked me last year if I'd open a brick and mortar store, I'd have answered no," said Emel, owner of The Traveling Bowl. "But it just kind of seemed like the next best step. I thought I wanted to have two food trucks, but after spending the winter with the trailer shut down and being in a kitchen, it seemed like that's the way to go."


   


  Emel, 32, is making the transition into the former Rita's Italian Ice building at 2221 N. Lorraine with the aid of a $7,000 loan from StartUp Hutch. The loan will help with expenses of the new equipment needed for the expansion, including the furnishing of a larger kitchen.


   


  "We regularly run out of food," said Emel. "It's a great problem to have, but we're also leaving money on the table when we don't have the capacity to serve everyone who would buy from us. The new kitchen and equipment will really help us grow."


   


  Along with the new location comes the addition of two new employees - one full- and one part-time - more seating for diners, and the addition of a drive-thru window.


   


  She plans to keep the trailer for catering weddings and other outdoor events and, if she's successful enough by next spring to hire more help, may put it back on the road.


   


  She'll maintain the name The Traveling Bowl since it refers to how she serves the home-style food.


   


  "Our bowls are convenient for on-the-go," she said. "They have lids and are microwave safe. We'll have drive-thru and carry out and a little bit of seating inside."


   


  The restaurant features a rotating menu of regular entrees, plus they'll continue to offer specials, she said.


   


  Hours will be 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, though hours may also change.


   


  Emel's parents, Mary and the late Jack Emel, were longtime local restaurateurs, operating Prime Thyme on Main Street, Samplers out in the county and Mr. Steak in Wichita, among others.


   


  So, though she spent five years in supply chain management after graduating from the University of Kansas, Emel also found it as a calling.


   


  "In times of economic distress, there are still opportunities for job growth for people who are creative and willing to innovate," said Jackson Swearer, entrepreneur navigator and program director for StartUp Hutch.


   


  "Traveling Bowl is a great example of a small business making strides for sustained success and our organization was happy to help with funding," he said.

The module will also teach students to nuance standard maritime historiographies through literary reading practices, as well as evaluate the metaphoric application of piracy to contemporary, interruptive, economic practices.

On just a day's notice, journeyman boxer Jamie Quinn caught a train to London for a four-round bout. On the way, he learned that they switched opponents and made it a six-rounder.


   


  The news might unnerve some fighters, but Quinn has shown he is ready for just about anything during a career with more than 100 losses.


   


  "You get paid more money for it," he said. "I just see them as jobs. I don't see them as fights."


   


  No preparation, no problem for the 30-year-old Quinn and the many journeymen who eke out a living by traveling around Britain to fight young prospects -- nearly every weekend before the coronavirus.


   


  Their role doesn't require intense video analysis of opponents. They're hired to fight up-and-comers, many of whom are unbeaten and looking to bolster their resumes. Wins are few and far between.


   


  Quinn has compiled 104 losses since turning professional, to go with seven wins and two draws. Since boxing events returned from the pandemic stoppage, he's fought and lost twice, most recently on Sept. 12.


   


  His record wasn't the worst on the night. Kevin McCauley slipped to 15-208-12 when he lost to Joshua Frankham, a cousin of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. Frankham, a super welterweight, was making his pro debut.


   


  "We're there to give these kids a test," said Quinn, a lightweight. "They like to rack up a couple of wins and get a taste of the pro game."


   


  Peter Buckley lost 256 of his 300 fights before retiring in 2008. The key is to go the distance because a stoppage means at least 28 days until they're medically eligible to fight again.


   


  Even if it raises eyebrows, the journeymen's role in British boxing is well- established. Promoters anywhere don't want to match promising unbeaten boxers against each other early in their careers.


   


  "They're part of the lifeblood of boxing," said author Melanie Lloyd, who has published several books on British boxing. "There's no illusions about it. If they win too regularly, they won't get any work. In America, they refer to them more as club fighters."


   


  Robert W. Smith, general secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control, dislikes the term "journeyman" but acknowledges they exist.


   


  "We don't license journeymen, we license boxers," Smith said. "Ultimately, within the industry we know that they are there to teach people lessons, to make them go the distance, and we're happy with that as long as they're not getting hurt. They go in there, they give a good account of themselves as best they can, to the best of their ability, and we're satisfied."


   


  If the boxer isn't trying, his license can be withdrawn, Smith said.


   


  Like other journeymen, McCauley fell into the role. He began his pro career 2-1 before losses started piling up. He quit his job as a roofer and boxed on the road to support his family. He is divorced and has two children.


   


  Along with last-minute bouts, boxers earn extra by facing prospects with knockout power.


   


  "No one wants to fight a big prospect," said the 41-year-old McCauley, who boxes in several weight classes.


   


  "They call me the 999 boxer," he said of 911-like emergency number in Britain. "If they're in trouble and they need someone, they just ring 999 and they get me."


   


  The going rate is about 1,200 pounds ($1,500) for a four-round bout and a bit more for six-rounders. McCauley said he's taken as little as 500 pounds ($640) for small-hall bouts. His manager gets 15%.


   


  As "away" fighters, journeymen rarely win decisions. McCauley claims 50 of his losses should have gone his way. He said no one has asked him to lose, but he'll occasionally hear comments like, "'another day in the office, Kev.'"


   


  "I'm like, hang on mate, I'm going to punch your face in," he said. "I'm one of the better, if not one of the best journeymen out there because I will have a go. If my head's there, if I've been in the gym, I've had a good week, then I'll go out to win."


   


  McCauley's last victory was nearly three years ago. He wants 15 more fights -- to reach 250 total. After that, he plans to teach boxing to troubled kids -- putting to use his recently earned criminology degree.


   


  In recent years, Eastern Europeans had begun replacing some of the local journeymen, but Quinn said he was doing well financially before the pandemic. Like many other boxers, Quinn also works outside the ring; he's a personal trainer.


   


  Quinn hopes to reach 200 fights. He last won 10 months ago and is scheduled to go again on Saturday. There have been 16 shows since July, all with coronavirus restrictions.


   


  He's tried other jobs, including bricklaying. His last fight earned him double his usual fee because it was last-minute.


   


  "Before boxing, people weren't exactly throwing jobs at me," said Quinn, who lives with his grandfather in Stockport, near Manchester.


   


  As a kid, Quinn looked up to former light welterweight champion Ricky Hatton. As his title dreams faded, he began facing youngsters who have the added pressure of selling tickets to fill home venues.


   


  "Some of them just box, but I've had a lot of them try to knock me out," he said. "They're trying to look good for the cameras, the crowd, whoever's there."


   


  Quinn has only been stopped a few times and has never been knocked out clean. He's suffered a fractured jaw and said his nose has been broken nine times.


   


  It's hard to sleep after fights, Quinn said.


   


  "All sorts of stuff is going through your mind," he said. "Do I really need to be doing this? Are there any easier ways of making money?"

Houthi officials said the deal includes the release of over 680 rebel prisoners in return for at least 400 from the government, including Saudi and Sudanese troops who were fighting on the side of the Saudi-led coalition. The officials said the swap would start on Oct. 15.


  The Houthi officials spoke on condition of anonymity because there were not authorized to brief the media.


  The U.N. said the deal was built on a plan both sides agreed to in February.


  Griffiths urged both parties to "move forward immediately with the release and to spare no effort in building upon this momentum to swiftly agree to releasing more detainees."


  "We have no time to waste, releasing the 1,081 individuals would and indeed will represent the largest release operation during the history of the conflict in Yemen," he said.


  He said the two sides agreed to meet again to discuss more releases, including top government officials covered by a U.N. Security Council resolution.


  Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC's director for the Middle East, also urged the parties to swiftly work to move the agreement "from signatures on paper to reality on the ground."


  The deal came amid months of fighting between the two sides over oil-rich Marib province, which is held by the government. The Houthis want to seize control of Marib to strengthen their position in the U.N.-mediated peace talks.


  The rebels have in recent months intensified missile and explosive-laden drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, with the coalition saying it intercepted and destroyed an explosive-laden drone on Sunday.

Greek officials on Sunday announced the first coronavirus death in a migrant camp near Athens, as refugee groups stepped up criticism of the containment policy of the Greek government and Europe.
 The victim was a 61-year-old father-of-two from Afghanistan who had been living in the Malakassa camp near Athens, the asylum ministry said. He died while being treated in a hospital in Athens.
 Malakassa, along with the Schisto and Elaionas camps near Athens, were placed in quarantine in early September as concerns mounted over the spread of the coronavirus among thousands of asylum-seekers living there in squalid conditions.
 Greece's migrant camps have been under lockdown since March, with restrictions on who can leave and enter, conditions harshly criticise by some rights groups.
 On the Aegean island of Lesbos meanwhile, more than 240 asylum-seekers who transferred to a temporary camp after the destruction of the Moria camp in fires earlier this month, have contracted the virus.
 Greek authorities on Sunday announced 218 new coronavirus cases and three deaths -- including that of the migrant.
 Since the start of the pandemic, 379 people have died of the virus in Greece, with an average age of 78. Sixty-eight people are currently in intensive care.
 Asylum Minister Notis Mitarachi said Sunday that all unaccompanied children had now been removed from the island camps.
 \- 'Conditions are dire' -
 But refugee groups are still angry at plans to keep the island facilities open for other asylum seekers and at the new EU migrant policy, unveiled on Wednesday.
 The EU's "New Pact on Migration and Asylum" calls for a tougher stance on returning migrants who do not have the right to stay in the EU, and for the ratcheting up border controls.
 "The (European) Commission promised 'No more Moria', while building a new containment camp in Lesbos, where conditions are dire," tweeted the one migrant rights group, Legal Centre Lesbos.
 The only flaw from Greece's perspective is the Commission giving up on quota- based redistribution of asylum seekers among EU countries -- a plan first mooted during the migration crisis of 2015 but which foundered on opposition from several member states.
 "While there has been a climate of support from Europe after the Moria blaze, the final answers are not what some people might expect," Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi told Real FM radio on Sunday.
 "There is a reserve in member states with few exceptions. Our country is constantly asking for relocations."
 The Greek government has struggled to manage overcrowding in camps on the five Aegean islands most affected by the arrivals -- even more so since the Moria camp on Lesbos burned down on September 8 and 9.
 Half of the 24,000 migrants packed into Greek camps remain on Lesbos.
 Government officials there scrambled to set up a provisional site for those left without shelter by the blaze, but charity groups were already incensed at conditions there.
 Campaigners point to the long waits the migrants endure for their one meal a day; the lack of mattresses and the impossibility of respecting coronavirus infection control measures like social distancing.
 "We have continuously exposed the human cost of this outrageous containment policy to leaders in European capitals, to commissioners in Brussels and to citizens through the media," Christos Christou, the president of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) tweeted.
 "But nothing seems to lead to a desperately needed radical policy change. Enough is enough. No more lies.".

You can’t tell if someone has Covid-19 if that person hasn’t been tested for Covid-19. Therefore, if a person passes away, the only way to really tell if Covid-19 was the culprit is to have administered a test while the person was actively infected. The trouble is testing is a bit all over the place right now. Correction, testing is not all over the place, which is the problem. Testing is only some of the places right now. A handful of states like New York and California have been coordinating testing more extensively than others. So it isn’t clear what percentage of actual Covid-19 cases and deaths each state is currently catching.

Oro Valley is allocating $1 million to assist local businesses with its new OV Safe Steps initiative, a move that some business owners said will help offset adverse effects spurned by the pandemic.


  The town launched the program Sept. 16, giving qualified businesses financial reimbursement of up to $500 for personal protective equipment, or PPE, $500 for marketing and advertising support, and $500 for business coaching.


  To qualify, businesses must have 50 or fewer employees, be for-profit, and have brick-and-mortar locations within the town limits. There are no strings attached, and businesses only have to provide receipts to receive reimbursements.


  Chris Cornelison, Oro Valley assistant town manager, said the goal of the program is to work with businesses to keep them open and “help them weather the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

 # Tigers use balanced attack in blowout win over Southeast
 Beau Bearden
 bbearden@gannett.com
 It wouldn’t have been too surprising if the Ardmore High School football team showed some signs of rust after two weeks without a game or even a snap at practice.
 But the break wasn’t an issue as the Tigers got off to a fast start Friday night and never looked back in a 53-16 victory over Southeast at Noble Stadium.
 “We were looking to pass more, and our receivers caught great and our running backs ran great,” said Ardmore quarterback Cal Swanson. “It was just a very well-played game.”
 And Swanson was a big part of that.
 The sophomore put on a show in just his second start for the Tigers by completing all six of his passes for 102 yards and three touchdowns — all to different receivers.
 Dakaree Scott hauled in a 44-yard touchdown pass, while Jalen Reed caught a 23-yard score and Donald May joined the fun with a 22-yard touchdown reception.
 “I was very proud of (Cal),” said Ardmore head coach Josh Newby. “I thought he was efficient and accurate. I wish we could have thrown more, but we were trying to keep the game within reason and be as classy as we could with the score.”
 There’s no telling how many yards Swanson could have racked up if the Tigers didn’t take the conservative route. However, Ardmore’s ground attack was on full display as Antone Scallion, Donald May and Khaleel McGee combined to run the ball 12 times for 239 yards and four touchdowns.
 Scallion led the way with three carries for 156 yards and two touchdowns. The junior would have finished with three scores, but one was called back on a penalty.
 “I feel like we came out and did a pretty great job for our return,” Scallion said. “If we keep our mindset to where we want to be at the end of the season, we can be great at anything we do.”
 And that’s exactly what Newby wants from the Tigers in the remaining games, especially after dealing with some issues against Southeast.
 However, there were a number of backups playing for most of the second half as Dakota Mitchell found Elijah Franks for a score late in the third quarter.
 “I was proud of the execution early in the game,” Newby said. “(But) when the score got a little lopsided, things got sloppy, which I’m disappointed in. There’s always things to improve and we’ll definitely improve.”
 The sloppiness also carried over to other aspects of the game as both teams struggled to keep their tempers in check. There were a number of unsportsmanlike penalties and near scuffles breaking out on the field.
 “We always talk about controlling your emotions and we lost it a little tonight,” Newby said. “I think the kids realize now, ‘Hey, coach knows what he’s talking about and we better do what he says.’ It was definitely a learning experience tonight and I think our kids realize that.”
 Ardmore will have plenty of time to learn as it won’t play until 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 9 on the road against Duncan. The Tigers were supposed to travel to Altus on Friday, Oct. 2, but the game has been postponed.
 Newby still hadn’t heard back from the school late Friday, but he expects to get confirmation on the game being moved to Monday, Oct. 19.
 Nevertheless, Ardmore will focus on itself for the next two weeks.
 “When you don’t have an opponent, you’re just on a mission to do the best you can to try to win a district championship,” Newby said. “That’s what we’re keeping in my mind. And that’s why we’re going to practice hard because we’re trying to go after to win it. We’re not picked to win it, so we’re trying to do what we can to give ourselves a chance.”

In the 74 days he was hospitalized, doctors desperately tried various experimental approaches, including enrolling him in a study of an antiviral drug that ultimately showed promise. Ming died on June 8. “It was just touch and go. Everything they wanted to try we said yes, do it,” said his daughter, Anne Peterson. “We would give anything to have him back, but if what we and he went through would help future patients, that’s what we want.” (Lu Wang via AP)

ATLANTA, Ga. (NEXSTAR) -- President Donald Trump announced he plans to designate the KKK and Antifa as terrorist organizations while unveiling his "Platinum Plan" for African-Americans during a Friday event.

Cabinet members like Wheeler have sought to make the case that while the Obama administration focused on distant issues like climate change, Trump has actually zeroed in on environmental issues close to home, like the quality of the water coming from taps.
 During his speech in Florida, Trump said his administration was “strengthening standards to prevent vulnerable children from being exposed to lead and copper in drinking water, including in our schools,” adding, “They were exposed to lead and copper in drinking water. We’ve done some job with that, that was an important one.”
 Republican strategists said Trump’s campaign might be trying to improve his standing among suburban women and other swing voters. But they also doubted it would pay off.
 “Trump’s not going to lead on climate obviously, so they have to look at specific problems they can try to solve,” said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican Party. He said promoting things like the update to the Lead and Copper Rule was a good strategy for Trump — but only because the administration had “tied one hand behind its back” by refusing to even engage on climate change.
 Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster, conceded, “If you are an environmental voter in 2020, you are voting for Joe Biden.” The Trump administration’s efforts on lead in water “won’t change a single vote,” he continued, even among undecided voters.
 Two former EPA officials described the new rule as insufficient. Ronnie Levin, a public health professor at Harvard University who spent 37 years at the EPA pioneering lead protections in water, paint and gasoline, said the agency’s political leaders shut its scientific experts out of deliberations on the new measure.
 Miguel Del Toral, who recently retired from the EPA in Chicago, where he also worked for more than 30 years on lead, agreed.
 “They had their minds made up about what they wanted and didn’t want in the rule, and we kept banging our heads against the wall arguing science,” Del Toral said.

“With COVID, we want to be in smaller groups to be able to social distance,” Haynes said. “We do (physical education) and arts, play board games, we go to the park every once in a while.”


  Camp COVID was a program Interserv started back in March, which could be seen as the origin of the virtual learning program. Staff also hosted a spring break camp, but as Haynes put it, that break ended up lasting until last month.


  “What used to be out-of-school time was considered after school or when schools are on break,” Haynes said. “Now, how we define out-of-school has, you know, changed within six months.”


  Initial umbers from the St. Joseph School District showed just under 27% of students enrolled to study virtually this year.


  The 21st Century Community Learning Center at Interserv is funded through a grant, which allows most families to take advantage of the program for free.


  The early-morning care and after-school program has a bus that can take students to Hosea and Hyde elementary schools and Spring Garden Middle School.

Frustration and anger led Larry McBride down a dark path for more than 20 years.


   


  He spent them in and out of correctional and treatment centers on various drug and theft charges. He would eventually make a decision to start following a different path that would keep him out of jail and would pay off the child support for his 11 children.


   


  It has taken 35 years, but McBride, 62, recently made his final payments. He made payments while in-and-out of jail and the treatment centers.


   


  When he decided to pay off his child support after leaving prison for the last time in 1998, he found out he had a bill of $353,000. He had a lot of pent up frustration associated with the child support program, but said he wanted to finally do something right.


   


  McBride's first experience with child support was when he was 19. He was working at Holiday Inn as the assistant supervisor of housekeeping, often working 50-60 hour work weeks.


   


  "I got a check for $12 every week," McBride said. "The system was totally unfair [then]. They believed you had to pay all the money you can."


   


  Child support obligations are figured by Missouri courts. Judges use formula worksheet to tabulate the amounts.


   


  After taking into account other child support obligations and a few other expenses, but not monthly bills for the person paying the support, the court sets the required amount.


   


  The court then submits a withholding form to employers to withhold remove child support from a person's income.


   


  The Missouri Division of Family Services is the enforcement agency and in fiscal 2019, the last year data is available, it collected $653.8 million. Of that amount, a little under 57 percent came from employer withholdings and about 15 percent comes directly from the parent who owes the support.


   


  Almost 5.5 percent came from intercepted federal tax refunds.


   


  Failure to pay can result in criminal charges, including a felony charge for parents who are more than 12 months behind.


   


  When he decided to tackle the enormous debt, McBride said he had to find ways to increase his income that would pay his household bills and continue to pay his child support.


   


  In intervening years, he also earned an associate's degree in business and a bachelor's degree in human services, which is similar to a social work degree. He is a pastor and now counsels other men who are making child support payments.


   


  He plans to pursue a master's degree in pastoral care and counseling through Missouri Baptist College.


   


  He has volunteered at Reality House Inc. and Love INC He also helped found the Como Freedom Fiters.


   


  Love INC works to assist Boone County residents in poverty, while Reality House provides counseling, substance abuse treatment and correctional services in a community setting, according to its website. Before COVID-19, Freedom Fiters would hold barbecues at Douglass Park, which would feature speakers on the Freedom Fiters' mission.


   


  "He has overcome many challenges to reach the point of having paid off a staggering amount [of child support] owed," Love INC Program Director Jane Williams wrote in an email. "He has developed relationships with people who work for the state and is able to offer practical advice to others."


   


  Larry's story is encouraging to people discouraged by their payment requirements if they do not have a plan to address them, she wrote.


   


  "I have known Larry for over 20 years and have seen him work in the community in many positive ways," Williams wrote. "He has held very effective groups and classes at Reality House and done jail ministry for years. We have collaborated informally many times to help various individuals in need."


   


  The main questions McBride receives when he is at Reality House are about child support, he said.


   


  "If you get out of jail or prison, [child support] will help you until you get on your feet," he said, adding the division will work with individuals who seek their help in modifying payment plans.


   


  Wrong road


   


  McBride blames his frustration with the child-support system for starting down a darker path. He started shoplifting, eventually receiving probation for those crimes. He was able to turn things around for a time working at the University of Missouri's Memorial Union.


   


  He became a supervisor, in charge of kitchens. He was again working up to 60 hours a week.


   


  Child support withholding was not as severe with this job, but it still was a significant portion of his paycheck.


   


  "I made $85 per paycheck," McBride. "I ended up quitting that job, too."


   


  His life took another turn after that. He started to use crack cocaine. McBride was looking for a way to take him away from his worries and anxiety over making payments into child support.


   


  "I was in and out of a lot of relationships and I started using crack," he said. "Crack sent me back-and-forth to jail. I just wanted some kind of relief from [child support], and I wasn't getting any."


   


  When he was released the last time, McBride said he wanted to get his life right. So he called up the child support offices and learned about his $353,000 debt.


   


  "I was upset. I can see why guys are upset today [about child support]. Wherever you go, it follows you," McBride said.


   


  One thing McBride wishes he had done early on is to contact child support services about temporarily reducing his payment amount.


   


  "I was just running because I was mad and upset, so I kept catching cases of shoplifting and stealing to support my habit," he said.


   


  If a person is required to make support payments, they should call their local office to see if they can have payments reduced, he said.


   


  "They will work with you and ask how much you can pay," McBride said.


   


  Faith and work


   


  McBride also turned to his faith to find a solution.


   


  "I prayed to God saying, 'Lord, I don't know how to do this,'" he said about his total arrears. "Everything seemed to work itself out."


   


  He started his pathway to repayment by going back to school, receiving his two degrees and working at Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital.


   


  "I stopped making bad decisions," McBride. "It took about seven or eight classes before I finally got it and it took two or three years before I graduated with my associate's degree in business."


   


  He later finished his bachelor's, but is waiting until COVID-19 conditions improve before seeking his master's degree, since he prefers in-seat instruction over virtual learning.


   


  When working at Truman, McBride's initial pay rate was $9.17 an hour, which increased after six months to $21 per hour. Even though McBride was making significantly more money, he still only was taking home $575 each pay period.


   


  "I bought a car but had to give it back because I couldn't afford [the payments]," he said.


   


  So, he had to find a solution to pay his bills and continue his support payments. McBride hopes that people and employers look past a person's criminal history to give them a chance to change.


   


  "I now have a relationship with the child support people. They are the ones helping me make sure I get this paid off," McBride said.


   


  He has since retired from Truman Hospital.


   


  While McBride's total arrears was more than $300,000, he estimates he's likely paid twice that over his many years of making payments. He will find out next week how much he has paid over the last 35 years.


   


  McBride still could be making major payments to this day if it were not for his side-job that helped him pay his other bills. He started collecting items discarded by students and scoured for antiques, collectibles and furniture, putting them into storage and holding quarterly garage sales.


   


  "Since 2008, I started picking up stuff," he said.


   


  He was selling items from a property, but when COVID-19 hit, he had to give up the building and return the items to storage.


   


  While he gets antiques and other collectibles from estates, other items he gathers are brand new, such as kitchen electronics. He continues to sell items periodically online.


   


  When he was holding the regular garage sales, he would make upward of $3,000, with a portion of that amount going to his assistants, many of whom were facing their own child support bills.


   


  "This helps me pay the other bills I have," McBride said. "If I have car payment and insurance and I get $500 a paycheck, I can't pay anything but a car payment."


   


  He hopes to eventually get another property where he can sell his collected art prints and other works he's collected over the years.


   


  "This pays the bills," McBride said. "The grace of God led people my way."

When Hurricane Sally swept through Alabama, Lake Martin’s Southern neighbors took the brunt of her hit. Due to the high volume of wreckage, sunken boats and massive debris, Tallapoosa County resident Chad Gilliland’s company Backwater Marine Towing and Salvage was called to service.
 Gilliland and his rotating crew of two to three men each week have been on the Gulf Coast for more than a week and plan to stick around for at least four months. They have set up camp in Freeport and venture out each day to various surrounding towns that have taken hard hits.
 “Basically down here there is just a lot of wreckage,” Gilliland said. “We’re not seeing in the areas I’ve worked a lot of structural damage but there are a lot of damaged boats because everyone was caught off guard.”
 When Sally was predicted to hit farther West and took a rapid change to the East, many residents in the area were ill prepared for her quick arrival.
 “We’re seeing a lot of damaged vessels, up in people’s yards or upside down — a little bit of everything,” Gilliland said.
 Gilliland and his team are mainly on salvage work duty helping to get beached boats back in the water.
 “We’re refloating boats with airbags we put under the boats to get them back in the water that have been high and dry,” Gilliland said. “Some are against someone’s house or in the yard and we have to drag it back straight. It’s basically like taking logs under the boat and letting it roll back easy without damaging the hull.”
 This ongoing effort has kept Gilliland and his crew running on little sleep and working 14- to 16-hour days.
 “Until about (Tuesday) I think the most sleep was about three and a half hours,” Gilliland said. “We need to get on a better pattern to last the duration. We look to be down here for a while. It will be a long cleanup.”
 Backwater Marine Towing and Salvage is the parent company of TowBoatUS, which Gilliland and his wife, Danah own on Lake Martin and Logan Lake Martin. The salvage side of the work extends to emergency efforts around the Southeast.
 “We’ve been assigned to the (catastrophe) teams and travel all over the Southeast doing this type of work,” Gilliland said. “I’ve been doing environmental cleanups and big recoveries since 2012. But I took over this business in 2018 and that’s when we were put on the CAT team.”
 The crewmembers working alongside Gilliland in the Orange Beach, Gulf Breeze and Niceville areas are also his TowBoatU.S. captains, who are all dive- certified and trained to handle salvage recovery work.
 “It’s been hectic,” Gilliland said. “We’re pretty slammed and have been working in the rain every day. Right now we’re dealing with the remnants of whatever hurricane was about to come through.”
 Not only is the weather arduous but also the seas are extremely rough, which adds a whole extra layer of danger to the work.
 “The water is up about 2 feet high and the rough seas make it hard when trying to move the boats around,” Gilliland said. “It’s some dangerous work.”
 Gilliland’s team deals with everything from 17-foot boats up to 60-foot boats. One such instance they tackled this past week was a 38-foot boat, which required roughly 50,000 pounds of lift to get raised.
 “Big boats like that, it gets entertaining to get those out because there is so much weight there,” Gilliland said. “That’s an all-day job.”
 Aside from boats that have sunk or broken loose, many have been crushed under boathouses.
 “These boats are in pretty bad shape,” Gilliland said. “A lot were still in the boathouses and they collapsed. There is a lot of carnage.”
 Gilliland has been rotating his help to keep everyone rested and keep TowBoatU.S. staffed and in action.
 “I’ll probably take a day or two to come home and handle things at the house but Danah’s been able to manage things,” Gilliland said. “And my guys will rotate who comes down to work with me.”
 Tallapoosa County was fortunate to avoid what could have been a hard hit from Hurricane Sally but locals are still putting in their time, effort and expertise to take care of neighboring Alabamians who weren’t so lucky.

BECAUSE THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS SUCH A HIT OR MISS THING BEING ONE RACE WINNER TAKES ALL, DO YOU THINK IT SPEAKS MORE FOR YOUR TEAM AND WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED BY FOCUSING ON THE NUMBER OF WINS AND WHERE YOU HAVE WON AND HOW OFTEN? “Certainly in today’s landscape it comes down to one race but we still had a great season regardless. I think if anything, just winning races kind of helps make your case if you don't win the championship but we are still going to go there and try to win. If we don't win the championship I would be lying to you if I said i wasn’t disappointed but at the same time we would keep our heads up knowing we had a really good season. Anytime you can win eight races it is a really great year. it is so different with how the playoffs work and how we crown a champion but at the same time the structure rewards winning and you have to win races to get to the Final Four and if we can get there it will be a huge thing for us. I dont’ think a championship necessarily defines if you had a good season or not. A perfect example is you could win 35 races and blow up at the beginning of Phoenix and you would finish fourth in the points. It is all so circumstantial to how your whole year went and we have had a great year so it will be a great season regardless.”

  United aren’t in a strong negotiating position to let them go so they might not be able to expect any giant transfer fees, but a big clear-out will really help to improve things in the long run.

In 2017, when she was decommissioned, there was sadness about the end of her innings but that was tinged with pride for what she had achieved. She had served in two navies for 55 years that would probably make her one of the longest serving aircraft carriers in the world. We bid a tearful but a gracious farewell to the old lady. But until she was towed away to Alang, there was hope that she would be salvaged in some way, may be as a museum, for training, for tourism or, possibly she could be a destination for diving and underwater exploration. There was a fond hope that she would find a dignified end. But when it was towed away to be sent to the ship-breaking yard where it will be broken down to metal for your shaving blades or mobikes, there was a sense that it was not the end she deserved. We, Navy people, are tremendously attached to the ships. Viraat was called vibrant Viraat. There are vibes that ships carry about them. You are deeply attached to the nuts and bolts, to the cabins you stayed in. There are small and big memories of your time on board that build your camaraderie and soldiering pride.

Secondo quanto precisato da Lajcak, il tema del confronto è stato concordato dal presidente della Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, e dal premier kosovaro Avdullah Hoti. "Il presidente Vucic e il primo ministro Hoti hanno convenuto che i loro negoziatori discuteranno delle rivendicazioni finanziarie e degli accordi relativi alle comunità minoritarie. Entrambi gli argomenti sono molto complessi, e per questo motivo domani discuteremo delle richieste finanziarie e nei prossimi giorni degli accordi per le comunità minoritarie", ha scritto Lajcak su Twitter. Il rappresentante speciale dell'Ue per il dialogo Belgrado-Pristina ha recentemente affermato che "è giunto il momento di completare con successo il processo di dialogo" dopo 10 anni. "Oggi sono esattamente 10 anni da quando l'Assemblea generale delle Nazioni Unite ha accolto con favore la disponibilità dell'Unione europea a mediare il processo di dialogo tra Belgrado e Pristina.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom continues to sign radical and dangerous legislation passed by the Democrat-dominated State Senate.


  President Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court was the perfect cover for Newsom to sign legislation allowing California inmates to be assigned to prison based on their gender identity. What could possibly go wrong?


  California is closed down, on fire, in debt, and its green electric grid is causing rolling blackouts. But it's full speed ahead on the leftist agenda for the Democrat-controlled Senate and Gov. Newsom. The new bill abandons the long-established practice of assigning inmates to separate facilities based on their sex. California inmates are now able to request a men's or women's facility based upon their gender identity. And surely we can trust violent felons not to abuse the system.


  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will now be required to ask during intake whether a prisoner identifies as intersex, nonbinary, or transgender. The inmate can then request to be assigned to either a men's or women's facility based upon their stated gender identity. Officers must also address the inmates using the pronouns of the inmate's choosing.


  According to ABC News, the state can only deny a request based on "management or security concerns," but the state must provide a written statement explaining the reason for the denial and give the inmate an opportunity to object.


  The legislation is the latest brainchild of the state senate's LGBT Legislative Caucus Chair, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who argues the legislation is needed to protect transgendered individuals behind bars. But what about the other prisoners?
