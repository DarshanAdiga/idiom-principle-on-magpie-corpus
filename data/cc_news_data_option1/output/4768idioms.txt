 LONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Jonny May scored twice, including one of the all- time great individual Twickenham tries, as a dominant England overwhelmed an inexperienced Ireland 18-7 on Saturday to make it two wins out of two in the Nations Cup.
 The winger's two scores and two Owen Farrell penalties had England 18-0 ahead early in the second half and they then defended brilliantly until Jacob Stockdale crossed late on to reward Ireland for their worthy second-half efforts.
 England top the group A standings with nine points with one game remaining away to Wales next week and remain on course for a potential competition decider at home against France or Scotland, who meet on Sunday.
 It was something of a strange performance from England, who were always in control but barely fired an attacking shot in the second half, seemingly content to display their admittedly impressive defensive organisation and aggression as Ireland banged away in midfield.
 Nonetheless, it was their fourth successive win over Ireland and gave Eddie Jones another useful pointer about where his team need to develop.
 After an early kicking battle, England began to pile on the pressure with their lineout drives and from one of them Farrell had the time to send up a high kick to the corner where May leapt high to catch and roll over the line for his 30th international try.
 Four minutes later he had his 31st - and one of his best - which made it all the more disappointing that there were no fans in place to acclaim it.
 Ireland overthrew an attacking lineout and England shovelled the ball across to May deep inside his own 22. The winger tore past Chris Farrell, kicked ahead and outpaced Jamison Gibson-Park in a 50-metre sprint, nudged it forward again over the tryline and gleefully dived on the ball.
 May had gone five games without a try but is now his country´s joint-second highest scorer alongside Ben Cohen and Will Greenwood - though still 18 adrift of Rory Underwood.
 Ireland, who began their campaign with victory over Wales last week, made almost no impression as Tom Curry, Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje all made key turnovers and England constantly disrupted the visitors´ lineout to reach halftime 12-0 up.
 Ireland started the second half well but were undone by unnecessary indiscipline that allowed Farrell to kick two penalties to take it to 18-0.
 Ireland´s halfback partnership of Ross Byrne and Gibson-Park had only one previous test start each and neither was able to impose themselves on the game, sitting deep and lacking accuracy in too many of their tactical kicks.
 The visitors did have a lot of the ball but England defended with fierce tenacity and snuffed out almost everything, with flanker Sam Underhill having a colossal game.
 After Henry Slade had brilliantly turned Chris Farrell as the centre crossed the line, Ireland finally got on the scoreboard five minutes from time when replacement flyhalf and former England under-20 player Billy Burns chipped through for fellow replacement Stockdale to catch on the full and score.

“When I got back, I couldn’t vote for president because I still had Virgin Islands residency,” Jones said. “But as I observed what was happening, I thought ‘this is crazy. I have to do my part.’”
 To start, Jones needed a like-minded artist who could help bring his ideas to life. Ever the networker, he tracked down Sirron Norris, the San Francisco- based illustrator behind the popular TV series “Bob’s Burgers.”
 While Norris didn’t have much time to spare, he referenced Jones to his assistant, 23-year-old Emory graduate Bria Goeller, a freelancer who was eager for the challenge.
 Together, the unlikely duo proved a success, as both set out on creating a bevy of punchy, yet moving images that plastered T-shirts and – to Jones’ surprise — sold quickly.
 “I thought ‘wow, people really like it. They’re connecting to it,’” he said.
 T-shirts included one of the Statue of Liberty with a giant post-it note on its chest reading “You’re in danger, girl,” referencing Trump’s Muslim ban and restrictions on immigration. On the back of the T-shirt, another post-it note on the back of Lady Liberty reads “We got your back!”
 Jones also came up with a slogan “I’m not anti-American. I’m just anti- stupid,” which also sold well on shirts, as well as the iconic photo of Muhammad Ali knocking out Sonny Liston but with a KO’d Trump superimposed onto Liston.
 All was moving steadily until weeks before the election when Jones and Goeller truly went viral with a photo illustration of then vice-presidential candidate and now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
 The image, titled “That Little Girl Was Me,” shows Harris walking beside a wall blazoned with the shadow of a six-year-old Ruby Bridges, the first African-American child to integrate an all-white public elementary school. The shadow of Bridges was inspired by the classic Norman Rockwell painting “The Problem We All Live With.”

This year, Cousins is averaging 268.3 yards per game in four home games and has tossed 11 touchdowns. Compare that to his road splits where he's averaging only 214.8 yards per start and has six touchdown passes in five games. Also, Dalvin Cook has been eating bad run defenses alive all season long, and Dallas' defense ranks 28th in DVOA against the run. Put it on purple." -- Tom Fornelli on why the Vikings are one of his best bets

Beginning Friday, Nov. 20, through Sunday, Nov 29, 2020 Ford County Sheriff's Office will join many other law enforcement agencies across the state, including the Kansas Highway Patrol, in the Kansas Thanksgiving Safe Arrival traffic enforcement campaign.
   
 While all Kansas Traffic Laws will be enforced, extra determination will be used to aggressively target and remove impaired drivers from our roads.
   
 According to Kansas Department of Transportation, the day before Thanksgiving sees more impairment-related crashes than any other day of the year.
   
 Those who choose to drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, are a danger to all they share the road with-their passengers, other motorists and their passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians.
   
 Impaired driving crashes tend to be more severe.
   
 On average, across Kansas, three persons are injured every day, and one person is killed every four days in alcohol/drug-related crashes. Vehicle occupants in alcohol- or other drug-related crashes are over 2 and a half times more likely to be injured or killed than those involved in crashes where alcohol or other drugs were not a factor.
   
 Each week across Kansas, over 250 drivers are arrested for choosing to drive impaired driving under the influence.
   
 A DUI conviction will result in jail time, the suspension or revocation of driver's license, a fine of $500 to $2,500, participation in an alcohol or other drug treatment program and, where alcohol is cited as a contributing factor, the purchase and installation of an ignition interlock device by the offender.
   
 This device prevents the vehicle from starting if alcohol is present in the driver's breath.
   
 All of this is in addition to thousands of dollars more for bail, court costs, and attorney fees.
   
 "Keep in mind that if you are going to be drinking - any amount at all- don't even consider driving home," Ford County Sheriff Bill Carr. "Arrange to ride with a non-drinking acquaintance BEFORE you go out."
   
 Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both is a choice you make.
   
 Make the right choice.
   
 On the drive to zero, you are in the driver's seat.

MUNICH, Germany, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Lacklustre Bayern Munich had to come from behind to rescue a 1-1 draw against Werder Bremen on Saturday, slipping up for only the second time in their last 35 matches in all competitions but staying a point ahead of undefeated Bayer Leverkusen.
 Four days after Germany's stunning 6-0 loss to Spain, there was little in terms of redemption for Bayern's many internationals, with the German champions failing to hit a single shot on target in the entire first half.
 Werder took a deserved lead on the stroke of halftime after Josh Sargent set up Max Eggestein who beat keeper Manuel Neuer with a well-placed left-footed effort.
 Bayern, who had won 33 of their previous 34 games in all competitions, had to wait until the 50th minute for Douglas Costa to rattle the crossbar with a fierce shot and the hosts to show some signs of life.
 They upped the pace briefly and Kingsley Coman drew them level, nodding in at the far post in the 62nd but for the next 20 minutes they again dropped back before a couple of late chances for Eric Choupo-Moting and Robert Lewandowski.
 The hosts, however, have Neuer to thank for avoiding the second league defeat of the season after he beat Sargent in a one-on-one in the 88th minute.
 Bayern are on 19 points, three ahead of RB Leipzig, who are in action later against Eintracht Frankfurt.
 Unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen are provisionally second on 18 after their 2-1 win over Arminia Bielefeld, courtesy of Aleksandar Dragovic's 88th-minute winner on the rebound.
 Schalke 04 slumped to a 2-0 defeat at home against VfL Wolfsburg and have now gone 24 league matches without a win. Schalke, who are edging closer to the all-time winless run of 31 matches in the league set by Tasmania Berlin in 1965/66, are 17th. (Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Clare Fallon)

 # Michigan, national GOP seek to delay certification of election results
 Beth LeBlanc
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 The state and national Republican parties have asked the Board of State Canvassers to delay certification of the state's election results in a bid to investigate "anomalies and irregularities" alleged to have occurred in Michigan's Nov. 3 election.
 Michigan Republican Party Chairwoman Laura Cox and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel asked the state to conduct a "full, transparent audit" before certification, noting other states like Georgia "have taken discretionary steps" in determining their results.
 The Board of State Canvassers is scheduled to meet Monday to consider certification.
 The request comes a day after Republican U.S. Senate candidate John James requested the same delay. James, a Farmington Hills businesstrails U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, by more than 92,000 votes in unofficial results after the 83 counties turned in their certified results, a gain for Peters of 9,000 votes from the preliminary results.
 "In light of the already unprecedented nature of this election — conducted largely by mail in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, it would be a grievous dereliction of this board’s duty to the people of Michigan not to ensure that the irregularities identified by the James Campaign are thoroughly investigated by a full audit before certifying Wayne County’s results," Cox and McDaniel wrote.
 Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Friday an audit could not be completed prior to the certification of results because "election officials do not have legal access to the documents needed to complete audits until the certification."
 Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons, a Republican, echoed those concerns when testifying Thursday before a joint legislative committee.
 "If you did it before the canvass was complete, you're auditing unofficial results," Posthumus Lyons said. "Additionally if you audit before a recount has taken place, you're opening up very secure containers, and things that are really important to protecting and preserving the security of the election before a potential recount takes place.
 "The order in which this all occurs I think is important as well," she said.
 Still, Cox and McDaniel argued it was possible to investigate some claims made in the affidavits and unbalanced poll books in Wayne County while still complying with the Dec. 8 deadline for certification. The states are required to certify by this "safe harbor" day or invite court or congressional intervention.
 "To simply gloss over those irregularities now without a thorough audit would only foster feelings of distrust among Michigan’s electorate," Cox and McDaniel wrote.
 Republican state canvasser Norm Shinkle told The Detroit News Friday he was considering moving for an audit and/or a delay of the final certification, but couldn't make a decision until presented by the Michigan Bureau of Elections report on the certifications from 83 counties.
 Shinkle said he wasn't convinced the Wayne County Board of Canvassers had successfully certified the election after GOP canvassers there attempted to rescind their affirmative votes after the 14-day deadline. The canvassers were unsuccessful in their attempt, Wayne County's legal counsel said.
 "Now, I’m only one voice out of four," Shinkle said. "But if there’s evidence that we need more information, then we should ask for it.”
 Wayne County's canvassers were told Tuesday that approximately 70% of Detroit's absentee vote counting boards were out of balance without explanation, potentially disqualifying them from a recount. The total plummeted for the city's in-person precincts, where 22% were out of balance and unexplained.
 Elections officials said the out-of-balance poll books were off by a few hundred votes in a county where about 878,000 people voted. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is leading President Donald Trump 51%-48% or by 154,000 votes in the unofficial but certified county results, a gain for Biden of 8,000 votes over the preliminary lead of 146,000 votes.
 Affidavits filed in suits seeking to stop the Wayne County canvass, which was certified last week, alleged barriers to poll challengers and irregularities in the way ballots were handled at the TCF Center in Detroit. Elections officials have rebutted the claims, and a Wayne County judge and state Court of Appeals panel have agreed.

Hours after being released, L.

Wisconsin law doesn’t permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they’re hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing.His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for Rittenhouse has raised millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Chelsea pressure - Chelsea's weary stars shrugged off their fatigue to make a strong start as Timo Werner raced onto a through ball for a low strike that Karl Darlow pushed away for a corner.
 Darlow was at full stretch again when Abraham met Hakim Ziyech's cross with a powerful header that the Newcastle keeper tipped over.
 The Blues' pressure was rewarded in the 10th minute when a short corner caught Newcastle flat-footed.
 Mason Mount whipped in a low cross and Fernandez turned it into his own net under pressure from Chilwell at the far post.
 The fifth Premier League own goal of the hapless Fernandez's career didn't sate Chelsea's appetite.
 With Lampard's men monopolising possession, Werner should have doubled their lead from Mount's pass, but the German forward scuffed his shot wide from 10 yards.
 Callum Wilson, who had scored six of Newcastle's 10 league goals this season, was missing with a hamstring injury and the Magpies were toothless in attack without their top scorer.
 Chelsea had a golden opportunity to kill them off when Werner robbed the dawdling Fabian Schar and raced into the Newcastle area, but instead of shooting he played an awful pass that was easily cleared.
 Blues defender Kurt Zouma headed just wide moments later before Chelsea had a momentary wobble.
 Isaac Hayden blazed over from close-range as Newcastle finally had a sight of goal and Joelinton curled over from the edge of the area moment later.
 But Chelsea put the result beyond doubt in the 65th minute when Werner accelerated away from the Newcastle defence and slipped a pass to Abraham, who guided his shot past Darlow and in off the post.
 Abraham has now scored in three consecutive appearances in all competitions for the first time since September 2019.
 Newcastle's Sean Longstaff hit the bar from long-range, but Chelsea's lead was never in jeopardy.

 England gave Ireland another comprehensive hiding to the tune of 18-7 at Twickenham on Saturday and took charge of their group in the Autumn Nations Cup.
 Winger Jonny May scored two first-half tries and Owen Farrell slotted three of four goalkicks as England deservedly led 12-0 at halftime and 18-0 late. They threatened to blank Ireland for the first time in 30 years but Billy Burns conjured a try for fellow Irish replacement Jacob Stockdale with six minutes left and converted it.
 It was the first scores England conceded in more than three hours of rugby across its last three games including Italy and Georgia.
 As good as May's tries were, England's defense was suffocatingly brilliant. The white shirts were quick off the line and physical, holding up Irish ball- carriers so that the visitors were not able to clear a single ruck within three seconds.
 England didn't miss its first 90 tackles and ended up making an incredible 246, missing only nine.

Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), quickly put away his phone after he realised he was on screen.
 Germany's Angela Merkel, who marks 15 years in power on Sunday, appeared in her trademark pose -- serious and focused.
 Apart from the glitches, John Kirton, director of the Canada-based G20 Research Group, said the event would be poorer without spontaneous interactions over "summit tables, coffee breaks, corridors or hotel gyms" typical of past meetings.
 \- Going green - Private jets, a common sight at past summits, were absent this year -- slashing the event's carbon footprint, along with the lack of leaders' motorcades which would ordinarily grind the host city to a halt.
 However, one green innovation, a new metro line slated to open in Riyadh for the summit, did not come to fruition in time as planned.
 \- Say cheese (and dates) - The lack of a traditional leaders' "family photo" brought home the reality of coronavirus restrictions on movement and gatherings.
 The encounters have defined several past gatherings, including the famous high-five between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman at the G20 in Buenos Aires in 2018.
 Instead, a composite shot was projected onto ruins in the historic town of Diriyah outside of Riyadh on the eve of the summit.
 In the shadow of the giant projection, media were treated to a glitzy spectacle of traditional musicians as they tucked into date sorbet.
 \- The Trump factor - US President Donald Trump, who was defeated in this month's presidential elections, will be the wildcard at this year's G20, with observers speculating that he might seek to use the platform to attack his rivals.
 Without the G20's customary family photo, there will be no risk of a repeat of the 2017 incident that saw Trump barge Montenegro's prime minister to secure centre-stage, during a photo opportunity at NATO headquarters in 2017.

For 24 years, Gordon Jones enjoyed a quiet life in the Virgin Islands, bouncing around odd jobs, from lineman to cable guy to jewelry salesman. But after returning to the mainland in 2016, at the height of the presidential election, the 62-year-old California native landed on a different path: political art. And now, his efforts have gone viral.
 “I’m no artist,” said Jones with a laugh. “But I am a non-conformist. I think outside the box and I want to make people feel good, empowered.”
 That desire led Jones to start WTF America, now known as Good Trubble, a design company that seeks to inspire hope and laughter in the face of political division. The company, according to Jones, was a reaction to the “bombastic” nature of then-candidate Donald Trump, and an attempt to make a positive difference, even in a small way.

Town Attorney Douglas Napier advanced a question to Mr. Wilson and the Commission: In the November 16th letter from Mr. & Mrs. Green, they point out Town Code section 175-136 states that special use permits are not transferrable to another party. He asked if Mr. Wilson knew of any zoning official opinions whether the owner of the property, who is also the owner of the special use permit, were it to be approved by the Town Council, be able to transfer it to a third party? Such a restriction could be a problem for a bank loan, as it would be a “cloud” on the title. Mr. Wilson responded that he had only recently become familiar with this part of the code and was unaware of any practice like that. The special use permit should run with the property, not the owner. Not to allow that would mean that each time a property subject to a special use permit changed hands, it would require a new application, and the town has not done that nor had he seen any other town governments require it. Each new owner is obviously subject to the terms of the special use permit originally approved.
