Maybe it helps to break it down into smaller pieces. "The number of dead is equivalent to a 9/11 attack every day for 67 days," The Associated Press notes. "It is roughly equal to the population of Salt Lake City or Huntsville, Alabama," being wiped out in seven months. "The tally means a U.S. death has happened every 1.5 minutes, on average, since the first official fatality in late February," Richards adds. "It means we have lost 1,450 plane loads full of people."

President Trump is once again making a big show out of selecting a nominee for the Supreme Court — only this time he's on a tight deadline, an already historically deadly viral pandemic is getting worse again, the economy is on the rocks, and a very consequential election is just over 40 days away. Jimmy Fallon captured all that in a _Tonight Show_ skit Tuesday night, where he dressed up in his Trump costume and turned the discernment process into a literal game show, _So You Want to Be A Supreme Court Justice_. His criteria included pointedly unspecified "values," looks, and, of course, distraction.

Adeline Fagan, 28, was doing a rotation two months ago treating coronavirus patients in the emergency room when she developed an infection that ended last week with her death, now among more than 200,000 lives lost in the US to the pandemic. As her parents mourn her, they remember a woman who spent her life dedicated to helping others.
 Fagan knew she was going to be a doctor from the time she was 11, Brant Fagan said. That was when she developed a terrible illness that put her in a wheelchair.
 "She went to a doctor who talked to her like a real human being, like an adult practically, and from that Day 1, she said she wanted to be a doctor to help people like that doctor helped her," he said. "That one visit changed her life."
 From there, she worked as a certified nursing assistant before medical school, and she went to Haiti four times on medical missions to serve people who lived too far outside a city to have easy health care access.
 Though she had a history of asthma, upper respiratory infections and pneumonia, her sisters told TV station KHOU, going into work was "what (Adeline) wants to be doing."
 "She just loved to help people, she really did," Brant Fagan said.
 But in July, by the end of a 12-hour shift, Adeline Fagan began to feel under the weather, according to a GoFundMe page. Within the week, her symptoms escalated, and she was admitted to the hospital.

Meanwhile, before Trump has even chosen his Supreme Court nominee, "51 out of 53 Republicans are now on board, while the other two stick out like masks at a MAGA rally," he said. "I still can't believe we're letting Trump make that choice. He's terrible at hiring people. Everyone he's ever hired is either fired, in prison, or in Steve Bannon's case, almost both."
