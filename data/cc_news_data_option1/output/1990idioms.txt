By Tom Krasovic
   
 The San Diego Union-Tribune
   
 (TNS) -- The Chargers expect Kenneth Murray to speed up their defense this year, even though rookie linebackers often struggle to grasp the NFL game.
   
 While his rare blend of speed and size are obvious, Murray will struggle -- and most rookies do -- if he can't make the right reads and adjustments on time. And because of the coronavirus pandemic shutting down each team's spring workouts, all NFL rookies now face a taller learning curve.
   
 Murray makes the case that he'll adapt fast, thanks to his intense career at the University of Oklahoma.
   
 Beyond the fact the school's nickname is the Sooners, not the Laters -- it does stand to reason that matching wits against Oklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley the past three years will make Murray a quicker study than many other NFL rookies.
   
 NFL coaches would love to be able to look under the hood at Riley's offense. Coaches such as the Rams' Sean McVay said they've pestered Riley to get the skinny on his teachings. After winning the Heisman Trophy under Riley, Sooners quarterbacks Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray went first in the 2018 and 2019 drafts, respectively, despite their below-average height.
   
 Some of the "Air Raid" concepts Riley honed at Texas Tech under coach Mike Leach are gaining favor in the NFL. Patrick Mahomes, the former Texas Tech quarterback, has led the Chiefs to the AFC title game and a Super Bowl victory in his two years as a starter.
   
 So, a Ph.D in Riley Ball gives Kenneth Murray a leg up on many rookies.
   
 "When you're going up against Coach Riley's offense, to be honest, it's extremely frustrating," Murray said in a recent video chat with reporters.
   
 "Because," he added, "it's like he defies all simple football rules that you have in place, especially as a linebacker. A lot of times he'll put things in place where you have one rule that may take you here, and he'll have another rule that may take you here. And he'll put both of those rules in one specific play, and so now you are stuck in the middle."
   
 As part of his high-level mind games in practice, Riley matched starters against starters.
   
 In 2018 that meant Murray dueled Mayfield, who went on to start 13 games as a Browns rookie. Then it was Kyler Murray, a faster, shorter, stronger-armed version of Mayfield who started every game last year for the Cardinals. Finally, last year, Kenneth Murray went against Jalen Hurts, a second-round selection last month of the Eagles.
   
 "That's pushed me a lot, playing against the guys at Oklahoma on the offensive end," Murray said. "It's definitely made me a better player."
   
 Murray was a fast learner in his own right, too.
   
 Graduating in timely fashion from his high school near Houston allowed him to enroll early at Oklahoma.
   
 He won a starting job that summer.
   
 He never missed a start in three years, supporting his report that he was smart and diligent about maintaining his body. For example, he lifted weights as part of his postgame routine and did a lot of stretching.
   
 While many linebackers slim down for the NFL scouting combine, allowing them to run faster, Murray held his playing weight -- 241 pounds -- and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds to place among the top 10% of linebackers in the draft class.
   
 "My weight hasn't changed," said the linebacker, whose above-average height (6-foot-2 {) and arm length are desired traits because of the NFL's increased emphasis on pass defense. "What you see is what you get. I was 240 pretty much all the time in college."
   
 The price to get Murray was one general manager Tom Telesco hadn't paid in his other seven drafts: two premium picks, traded to the Patriots, allowing Telesco to climb from 37 to 23.
   
 Mindful of Team Spanos' 5-11 record and last-place finish last year, I suggested using two premium chips on two players was the better way to go, but another team's investment four spots late stood out. That's when the Seahawks, in a move that surprised many draftniks, selected Jordyn Brooks.
   
 , also a swift, durable linebacker with Air Raid know-how and a Big 12 pedigree. Seahawks leaders John Schneider and Pete Carroll have built two Super Bowl teams, and have had a lot of success finding defenders who became NFL stars.
   
 Telesco and John Spanos have no AFC West titles to show for their seven years together, extending a trend that covered A.J. Smith's final three seasons as general manager. Getting past the go-go Chiefs of Mahomes and coach Andy Reid is the franchise's biggest obstacle. Murray seems equipped to help.

In the past decade, Parliament met, on an average, for little over two months per year to transact legislative business and debate key issues. That obviously is too short a period for members of either House to come to grips, in any meaningful manner, with legislations and other matters of import.


  What couldn't be realised in open sessions of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha was made possible through the department related standing committees (DRSCs) that were Parliament's microcosm. Their in-camera proceedings provided members the requisite relief from public glare to rise above partisan political/party interests for reaching consensus or broad agreements, on the stickiest of issues. Democracy indeed worked better in these miniature groups.


  In normal times, the parliamentary panels, especially the DRSCs, met through the year, deliberating on a host of issues, especially Bills and budgetary demands of various ministries and departments. The nationwide lockdown that began on March 25 hit these panels the hardest, their "core contribution" power-braked by the absence of committee members, many of whom were confined to their home constituencies and states.


  The March 25 countrywide closure Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic was enforced two days after Parliament curtailed its Budget Session. After the initial view that cutting short the session could demoralise the people in general, and the doctors and paramedics in particular, such was the alarm triggered by the medical emergency that the all important Finance Bill, 2020 was passed without any debate in the Lok Sabha.


   


   


  It was against this backdrop that RS chairman Venkaiah Naidu and LS Speaker Om Birla met on May 7, the 44th day of the lockdown to look for ways to put the committee-work back on rails. They followed up those confabulations with another meeting on May 18 -- the 55th day of the shutdown marked by substantial easing of the initial restrictions.


  In their first meeting, Naidu and Birla had asked secretaries general of the two Houses to explore the possibility of DRSC meetings through video- conferencing. The SGs have since reverted to the presiding officers, pointing out "serious" technical and security issues in e-linking members stationed in different states, a person familiar with the discussions told this writer.


  The other glitch is that Parliament's general purposes committee might have to be co-opted as the matter falls in its jurisdiction. That committee too is of members from both Houses who will have to discuss the matter online.


  The nearly two dozen DRSCs were institutionalised in 1993 to help parliamentarians understand the complexities of governance.


  They generally have as members 21 LS MPs and 10 from the Upper House who meet under a designated chairperson.


  They are the platforms to which officials are summoned for clarifications to enhance the members' understanding of the subjects under discussion. It is that element in their work that brings up the security aspect on which there's little scope to take chances.


  At their last meeting on Monday, the presiding officers were nevertheless sanguine that DRSCs could resume work in the event of air travel opening on the conclusion of lockdown 4.0 on May 31 or anytime thereafter.


  A plain reading of the Lok Sabha's Rule 266 -- which says the meetings have to be held in private -- also puts the balance in favour of regular interactions as opposed to online discussions. If that regimen is possible, it'll at once obviate the logistical and confidentiality pitfalls.


  Aside from removing bottlenecks to make DRSCs functional, there's the challenge of holding Parliament's Monsoon session -- generally scheduled in July -- while ensuring social distancing in the LS-RS chambers where the seating arrangements are too cluttered to meet the post-Covid standards.


  The Parliament was adjourned sine die on March 23. As per the Constitution's Article 85(I), it has to meet before the expiry of six months. That leaves scope for delaying the Monsoon sitting -- but issues relating to the seating plans will remain.


  The summoning of Parliament is in the Government's domain. Yet, a veteran MP chose to think aloud. He suggested, on conditions of anonymity, that if the pandemic persists, the 245 member Rajya Sabha could meet in the larger Lok Sabha chamber and the latter could shift to the spacious Central Hall. Doable though they may seem, such improvisations to reopen our democracy's highest temple require wider consultations and agreement.

What followed was a transformation of the free markets themselves. Suddenly, the Internet was its own market -- and a lucrative one. Silicon Valley existed before Netscape, but, as its name suggests, it was known as the hub of microprocessing, not the web. Netscape created the modern Silicon Valley, where entrepreneurs and venture capitalists could meet at a table on Sand Hill Road and scribble out plans for a multimillion-dollar corporation on the back of a napkin. People with stable jobs in technology left those for startups with not even a dollar in revenue (or even a believable revenue model, for that matter). Culturally, such moves not only became acceptable, they became part of a career path. Would Eric Schmidt have left Sun Microsystems for Novell and, eventually, for a little startup called Google had Jim Barksdale not set the stage by leaving McCaw to run Netscape?

Say for example, your neighbors’ honeybees were hungry, it was warm enough outside to fly, and you were baking tasty treats and goodies in your kitchen that would make any sugar loving, sugar smelling creature come running (especially any men in your life). Suppose your kitchen was warm enough to leave the windows open and a scout from your neighbors hive caught a whiff of the goodies on the wind (the honeybee have a amazing sense of smell). If they had any access to this sweet stuff, the hive would quickly learn of its location and you would see a beeline. I use this example because a beekeeper friend of mine told me this story, it is true. He followed his bees to his neighbors’ kitchen, after the neighbor complained that they were all over the place. The problem was resolved quite quickly by providing the bees with food of their own.

HERKIMER -- Cornerstone Mobile Counseling, which provides services throughout Central New York, expects to be able to serve more people and better protect its staff and clients thanks to a $15,000 grant from Citizens Bank.


   


  Cornerstone is the only local, Central New York business to receive this nationwide grant, according to Chelsea Lawson, outreach coordinator.


   


  "It's going to allow us to expand who we're serving," she said. "Traditionally, we help everyone we can, but this will allow us to help more people who are uninsured. We saw the need pop up with the pandemic."


   


  She added that many people who are uninsured reach out to the service for help and this ensures Cornerstone can provide services to them as well as continuing to serve its present clients.


   


  Cornerstone, in Herkimer, provides in-home mental health services, as well as telehealth services to low-income people throughout Central New York, from Syracuse to Albany, with the mission of aiding in the fight to end generational poverty she said.


   


  According to Cornerstone's director and founder, Ward Halverson, the funds will be used to provide free ongoing mental health services to uninsured individuals and to provide counselors and the families being served with personal protective equipment.


   


  Cornerstone's counselors usually see people in their homes, but the restrictions in place due to the pandemic have made it difficult, Lawson said. "We do wellness checks. Traditionally people are seen face to face - sometimes in a lawn chair sitting apart from them if the weather is nice. It's important for a lot of our current clients to have that face-to-face contact. A lot don't have the technology for telehealth or other online services. We serve lower income families. With PPE it's safer for our clinicians and for the people they serve. We can reach more and more people and provide services to them."


   


  Many clients hear about the service through word of mouth or community agencies, she said, adding that Cornerstone continues to expand and is recruiting counselors and clinicians.


   


  Last month, Citizens Bank committed $2 million to a Small Business Recovery Program. Out of 14,000 applicants, the bank awarded 134 small businesses nationwide $15,000 grants to help communities hurt by the pandemic. The grants are part of the bank's $5 million commitment to help communities hurt by the pandemic, according to a news release.

“I’ve heard from a lot of people that we need to get our restaurants and personal care salons open. That’s going to happen now, and it’s going to be done in a safe way,” Cooper said during a Wednesday news briefing. “We must take a cautious approach to make sure this works the right way, to keep our curve flat and make sure we don’t encourage the spread of this virus.”


  Salon owners worry they won’t be able to stay in business if they can operate at no more than 50% capacity.


  Cooper’s decision to add salons under Phase Two would make it tougher to prevail in a lawsuit against the statewide order, said Jeanette Doran, president and general counsel of the North Carolina Institute for Constitutional Law. “They could try to argue that the restrictions are so severe that for all practical purposes they are shut down,” Doran said. “They could still try to make that argument, but it wouldn’t be very likely to succeed.”


  But a lawsuit challenging local orders that have maintained a salon shutdown and other tighter restrictions than the statewide order may fare better, she said.


  The Nerdy Colorist Salon owner Tiffany Benedict of Greensboro said Tuesday she has mixed feelings about the lawsuit. She hoped it would draw the governor’s attention, but she also feared backlash.


  “We’re out here. We can’t work,” Benedict said. “[The state] took that away, but also haven’t made any accommodations for us to survive, whether it is with our business or with unemployment. Unemployment is so hard to get.”


  Benedict says she’s one of the lucky ones. After waiting several weeks to get through to the Division of Employment Security, she qualified for benefits and for a Economic Injury Disaster Loan to cover her utilities and rent.


  “But that money is gone. I’ve been closed for two-and-a-half months. It’s very scary times,” Benedict said. “I’ve got two kids at home, I’m a single parent. It’s just me. I’m afraid that if I can’t generate the same amount of money, it’s going to cut into my kids’ time and my ability to take care of them.”


  If filed, the lawsuit would join an earlier lawsuit that overthrew Cooper’s ban on indoor worship services. Doran expects more lawsuits to follow, especially against the local governments that continue shuttering businesses.


  “I’m honestly surprised it’s taken so long to see these kinds of cases,” Doran said. “I think we can expect that we will see litigation in the next several days or weeks if we don’t get some relief from these edicts.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles County’s death toll from the coronavirus passed 2,000 on Thursday even as other figures pointed to progress in slowing the spread of the disease. The largest county in California recorded 46 more COVID-19-related deaths for a total of 2,016. That represents about 60% of all virus-related deaths in California. “This is a very sad milestone for us,” Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said at a daily news briefing. However, Ferrer said the average recent rates of hospitalizations and deaths in the county are decreasing and one study suggests the rate of COVID-19 prevalence didn’t rise between March and April. The county has seen more than 42,000 cases. Authorities have indicated that unlike most counties, L.A. won't be able to meet the state requirements to accelerate the reopening of its economy by allowing currently prohibited activities, such as dining inside restaurants. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been relaxing some of the strict stay-at-home requirements he instituted in March that have shuttered most businesses and thrown the economy into a tailspin. With millions filing for unemployment benefits, there has been a growing push by counties to move more quickly towards reopening even as polls show general support by the public in general for stay-at-home orders. Newsom this week announced relaxed standards for measuring a county's success against the virus. Meeting the marks allows a county to request approval from the state to reopen more businesses and recreational activities. Large counties had complained that a provision of the original standards that required no deaths from the virus for two weeks meant only smaller counties would be approved. That requirement was removed and many large counties are now among those...

2\. Honeybees are not the only pollinators of our crops. They're not even the best pollinators. Syrphid flies are better pollinators (most people can't tell them from the bees they resemble), and there are several other insects that do a good job of pollination. This was illustrated during the varroa mite infestation a couple decades ago as mentioned in the article. The newspapers were quoting entomologists saying doom and gloom about how our crops would not be adequately pollinated that year. I checked on my favorite fruit tree all during the bloom time for the tree. It's a plum tree variety which the Western Garden Book says needs another tree to pollinate (it's not self-fruitful). I checked the tree at all times of day and in varying weather during the entire bloom. I didn't see a single honeybee. I saw a couple syrphid flies and a few other insects I didn't recognize, but no honeybees. Later in the spring, I had to thin the fruit, as usual, to prevent the branches from breaking since the tree had set too much fruit. The honeybees were totally unnecessary.

Stacey Abrams is running a less-than-subtle campaign to be Joe Biden's vice- presidential running mate. Republicans should hope she succeeds. If selected, she would displace Sarah Palin as the least-qualified person ever to serve on a major-party ticket.


   


  Biden should understand this, because he saw firsthand how much damage Palin's selection did to then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. Preelection polls showed that six out of 10 Americans said Palin was not qualified for the job, and a Stanford University study found that she cost McCain more than 2 million votes.


   


  As Newsweek's Howard Fineman pointed out at the time, Palin "sent wavering Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans scurrying to Sen. Barack Obama." People simply could not see Palin stepping into the presidency if McCain - who was the second-oldest person ever to win a major party's presidential nomination -- were incapacitated.


   


  Abrams makes Palin seem qualified by comparison. At least Palin won her race for Alaska governor. Abrams' claim to fame is that she lost Georgia's governor's race in 2018. Indeed, she has never won a statewide race. The highest office she has ever attained is minority leader of the Georgia state House of Representatives, a part-time legislature. Apparently, she thinks this qualifies her to be leader of the free world.


   


  Last year, Abrams briefly considered a run for president herself, telling The Washington Post in an interview "I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience."


   


  According to her official bio, her foreign policy experience is serving as a "former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations" (a temporary membership for young people) as well as holding a string of fellowships that might qualify her for an entry-level research job at a think tank. She is an accomplished author -- not of foreign policy treatises, but of romantic suspense novels.


   


  But Abrams' lack of either experience or electoral success has not stopped her from actively pursuing the vice presidency. In recent weeks she has done a raft of interviews, culminating with an online joint appearance with Biden. Abrams makes the case that she tripled turnout among Latinos and Asian Americans and boosted African American turnout by 40 percent in Georgia in her gubernatorial run -- and that she could do the same for Biden nationally.


   


  "That's why you have running mates," she says. No, the reason you have running mates is so they can assume the duties of commander in chief if the president is incapacitated. That is why George W. Bush selected Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary, and why Obama selected Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Whatever advantage Abrams might bring with minority voters who are already in Biden's camp would be dwarfed by her obvious lack of readiness for the presidency, which would drive away the moderate suburban Republicans and independents in the swing states that Biden needs to defeat Trump.


   


  And presidential readiness will be more important for Biden's running mate than for any other vice-presidential pick in modern times. If elected, Biden would be older on the day he takes office than Ronald Reagan was on the day he left office. Biden's not just old, but also incredibly fragile - a fact we are reminded of whenever he emerges to do an interview from his Delaware basement. Biden has essentially acknowledged that he will be a transitional figure who will serve as a "bridge" to a new generation of leaders. If elected, he would be a caretaker president who would serve one term at most and keep the seat warm for his successor.


   


  That means Biden's choice of a successor will have outsize importance. In most elections, voters do not cast their ballots for the vice president. But this time around, Biden's vice president will really be a president-in-waiting - one who could very well be required to step into the presidency before Biden's term is up.


   


  McCain later said he regretted picking Palin as his running mate. Biden would similarly regret choosing Abrams. She would be a weak vice-presidential pick under any circumstances, but in Biden's case she could cost him the White House.

Arroyo, 84, was elected to the Assembly in 1994, becoming the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in the chamber. The longtime lawmaker did not return a call for comment.


  Documents included with Septimo’s original court challenge show Arroyo’s campaign picked up the petition sheets on Feb. 27.


  However, hundreds of signatures the incumbent submitted to the Board of Elections were dated Feb. 25 and 26.


  According to the court filing, 512 of the 944 signatures collected by the Arroyo campaign are dated before the 27th and in some cases dates appear to have been altered.


  Gov. Cuomo lowered the signature threshold for Assembly candidates to just 150 due to the coronavirus crisis.


  The decision means Septimo will be the only Democrat on the ballot for the June 23 primary. The 84th Assembly district covers a large swath of the South Bronx including Mott Haven, Hunts Point and neighborhoods near Yankee Stadium.


  The Court of Appeals is the state’s highest court and the only way Arroyo could further appeal the decision would be to take it to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would be unlikely to take up the case.


  Arroyo is no stranger to allegations of campaign misconduct and other shady dealings.

Since marrying in 2002, Doug Behan and Lise Deguire have gone on safari in Tanzania, watched the sunset over the Santorini caldera in the Greek Islands and walked through the ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru.      And those are just a few of their annual excursions. "It's on my bucket list that I want to visit every continent," Deguire said.      Early this year, the Yardley, Pennsylvania, couple began planning a 12-day trip to Japan in March. But then news of COVID-19 began saturating the airwaves. By February, the couple made the difficult decision to cancel, instead booking a one-week trip to New Mexico. As the virus continued to spread even more, they nixed that, too, replacing it with a three-day retreat at a local spa.      But on March 19, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf ordered all non-life- sustaining businesses to close their physical locations.      "That was pretty devastating," Deguire said. "Travel makes me feel very alive, like living on the edge in a way that's exciting and fulfilling."      It's not just tourists who are canceling trips. North Carolina's Outer Banks set up checkpoints to greet visitors, temporarily barring non-permanent residents and those without an entry permit. It's one of several resort communities around the country, including Key West and California's Mono County, which requested visitors stay away - sacrificing vital tourism dollars in an effort to keep out COVID-19.      That's in line with recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends people stay at home as much as possible and to avoid travel altogether, especially when sick.      The unprecedented travel restrictions may take a toll, said James Petrick, a professor, research fellow and the associate department head for graduate studies in the department of recreation, parks and tourism sciences at Texas A&M; University in College Station.      "We know that we learn much more when we're experiencing new things, and relationships are stronger when a couple travels together," he said. "The benefits that we receive when we travel don't just exist on vacation. They exist afterward and embed themselves in our existence."      Indeed, a number of studies have shown that even planning for a vacation makes people happier.      Not to mention the health benefits.      A 2000 trial that tracked middle-aged men for nine years found those who take an annual vacation were less likely to die from heart attacks and other cardiovascular-related issues. And women who vacation regularly were found in a 1992 study to be less likely to have a heart attack or coronary death than those who did so less often.      That makes sense to Petrick. "If I travel somewhere and come back, I'm less stressed than I was before."      And stress can impact health and wellbeing in many ways. According to Dr. Anand Rohatgi, a preventive cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, chronic stress can flood the body with compounds called catecholamines, which include so-called stress hormones like adrenaline.      "If you're always having increased catecholamines in your system, it can lead to high blood pressure, worse metabolism and worsening of inflammation in your body," Rohatgi said. "Over time, that can lead to more plaques in your arteries, heart attacks and strokes.      "Whatever your environment is, if it's stressful, taking a break from it can improve heart health," he added.      Both Petrick and Rohatgi said to achieve the greatest effect, the vacation should be distinctly different from one's day-to-day environment - especially the stressful parts. That means, for one, fighting the temptation to check work emails.      "It's important to relax and not have to think about things that add to stress - how am I going to pay the bills, work responsibilities and perhaps even caretaking responsibilities," Rohatgi said. "You want to be in a place where that burden is lifted."      In a time when travel is all but restricted, however, what should people do to achieve those benefits?      Rohatgi recommends people get out and explore new parks and trails, visit new areas in the community and develop new hobbies. Setting aside time to be alone also is important.      "Read a book, listen to music, and build in a couple of times per day where you can go outside and take a walk," he said.      Petrick advises people to get creative about how they vary their routine. One idea is to take a drive and allow a literal roll of the dice to determine which way to turn at each intersection.      "When we get outside of our usual environment, the brain is much more active," he said. "If you are staycationing, you have to find a way to make it novel."      Doug Behan and Lise Deguire have taken that to heart.      For example, during a recent "Lord of the Rings" viewing party with their two college-age daughters and a friend who is staying with them, the entire family dressed up as the characters from the movie, repurposing old rings, reimagining a pair of scissors as a sword and turning old clothes into hobbit capes and elf crowns.   "It was a hoot," Deguire said.      But she admits it's not quite as exciting as getting away. The entire clan was scheduled to depart on a Canadian cruise in August, but in late April, Deguire canceled that, too.      "Everyone is pretty sad about that, but we hope to reschedule," she said. "Travel memories are really bonding and important for us as a couple and a family."

IOWA CITY -- Ohio State boldly set the pace for returning to football in the Big Ten Conference on Wednesday, putting its prominent athletic director at the front of the conversation and announcing it would open its football facility's doors to athletes June 8.


   


  It's hard to imagine rival programs ceding much ground to the Buckeyes, the league's powerhouse program of late -- and now perhaps the standard-setter for getting prepared for an on-time start to the college season, even as concerns about the spread of COVID-19 remain high.


   


  That list includes Iowa, which is set to face Ohio State in football on Oct. 10 -- 4 1/2 months from now -- in Columbus.


   


  Coupled with the NCAA Division I Council's approval Wednesday to lift a moratorium on facility use for athletes (the ruling approves "voluntary" workouts starting June 1 for those in football and men's and women's basketball), Ohio State's earlier announcement was akin to a starter's gun at a track meet.


   


  The race is on for strength coaches and athletes to scramble back to facilities, but to do it safely and with great care. It's not like the coronavirus has gone away, so this is hardly a decision that should be rushed. Yet, competitively, time is of the essence.


   


  Government and health officials (not to mention the virus itself) will have the ultimate veto power, and that'll depend on the state. But based on Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds' leniency that high school baseball and softball seasons can begin in June, so decisions from Iowa (and Iowa State) would likely come from university officials.


   


  Iowa athletics director Gary Barta -- who is a part of the 40-member D-I Council -- was not ready to pronounce a great return for Hawkeye sports as of Wednesday afternoon. If Iowa is going to open its facilities to athletes, it makes sense to wait until a unified plan (like Ohio State's) is in place.


   


  "The Iowa athletics department continues to work with the UI's Critical Incident Management Team on developing protocols related to student-athletes and staff returning to campus," university athletics spokesman Steve Roe said. "A specific return date has not been determined at this time."


   


  In Columbus, athletics director Gene Smith outlined some of Ohio State's intended protocols for June 8, which happens to be one day after the Big Ten presidents and chancellors have their annual meeting -- one that figures to hash out further guidelines about the conference's plan to return to football and basketball.


   


  For starters, the workouts would be voluntary, Smith said. And, as you can probably ascertain, "voluntary" certainly puts pressure on 85 scholarship athletes plus walk-ons to make sure they're doing all they can to not lose playing time come fall. Smith said, at first, no more than 10 athletes would be allowed into the Woody Hayes Athletic Center at a time. He also supports restricting organized team activities through June 30.


   


  Such a timetable demonstrates boldness yet measured caution. Considered one of the leaders in college sports, Smith's voice carries ample heft. If he's out front talking on this, he's going to have followers.


   


  Smith's comments Wednesday, though, also reflect the uncertainty ahead. He told Buckeyes beat writers that a "best-case scenario" would allow players to return to full practices six weeks before the season opener but that might turn into five weeks or four -- a timetable that left Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz uneasy in a conversation last month.


   


  Smith's comments should also tell you that the idea of trying to start the season as planned. Minnesota is first up in the Big Ten, on Sept. 3, with all 14 teams playing by Sept. 5. Iowa is scheduled to host Northern Iowa on Sept. 5, with trophy games against Iowa State and Minnesota in the following weeks.


   


  Smith also indicated he was growing more comfortable with games without fans. He hopes that doesn't happen, but he knows that's realistic. He said that Ohio State has discussed scenarios in which it permits 20,000 to 22,000 fans -- about 20% of Ohio Stadium's capacity of around 105,000. Perhaps more telling, Smith said up to 50,000 could be possible, but he felt that was the ceiling.


   


  In other words, be prepared for anything from an empty Kinnick Stadium to a half-full Kinnick Stadium this fall. At best.


   


  But for now, the doors seem to be opening for football to inch forward toward live games in September.

For starters, App Store gatekeepers are notoriously persnickety about which apps they approve, and anything they deem too edgy or risque can be problematic. Muselli, who spent weeks studying the App Store ecosystem, warned that Apple's seal of approval was no sure thing and underlined the importance of allowing extra time at the end of the project calendar to accommodate changes necessary to conform to the store's developer rule book. It was also critical, Muselli added, that Bosshole be available in time for the 2012 holiday season, when millions of consumers would unwrap new smartphones and tablets and begin populating those gifts with apps.

At 83, Bundy was becoming a first-time homebuyer. Her new domain — an 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom house on Guerrant Street in Greensboro.


  “Amid everything that’s been going on, this is something that can give people a little bit of hope,” said Cosandra Young, a real estate agent with Jamestown-based AlmaJAnnie Realty. “If she can buy a home at 83, other people can do it at 23 or 33 or 43.”


  Bundy, who hails from New Jersey, retired in 2001 as housekeeping supervisor at a school and moved to the area to be close to her daughter and grandkids. For the past several years, she had been renting a house on Erwin Street in Greensboro.


  She decided to start house hunting, she said, after trying to get a toilet fixed. It kept running, which caused her water bill to go up. She also had to get a refrigerator replaced.


  Bundy said the landlord had given some money to replace the food lost in the bad refrigerator, but she was dissatisfied with the type of refrigerator he brought in. (Her landlord, David Kiddy of Oak Ridge, said he fixed the problems in a prompt manner and Bundy had seemed happy with the work that was done.)


  She said she was also worried about a possible rent increase.


  “I started looking at houses in November,” she said. “And I kept praying ‘God, lead me to the house you want me to have.’ ”


  Eventually she came upon the house on Guerrant Street.

“It has a large bedroom, a sunroom, a carport in the back for two cars,” she said. “It’s just lovely. And I feel like this is what God wanted me to have.”


  The house cost $108,500, and as a first-time homebuyer, she was eligible for $10,000 from the city of Greensboro to put toward the purchase.


  But the assistance was also holding up her moving plans. She couldn’t close on the house until the money came through.


  “I was answering the phone hoping every time that they’ll tell me the closing will be in 10 minutes,” she said. “It was frustrating having to wait.”


  The house also had some peeling paint that had to be replaced.


  Young, some co-workers and a contractor “went out there, and we were able to get it scraped off and get new paint,” Young said.


  Finally, on May 1, Bundy got the call that she was good to go.


  “Ms. Bundy, she went over to the attorney and sat outside for probably two hours, waiting to get inside to sign,” said Marcy Jones, the owner of AlmaJAnnie Realty. “I told her not to do that, but she said she was going there on faith and sitting there until they were ready. And, I also tip my hat to the city of Greensboro, who worked tirelessly to get this done.”


  Bundy wore gloves and a surgical mask for the signing. When she finally got to the house, she found a red ribbon and bow at the front door.


  “I thought I was going to lose my religion because it took so long,” she said. “But overall, things went well. And I’m very, very happy with my house. I just have a lot of work to do to get settled.”

 With COVID-19 canceling many events including spring sports, weddings, concerts and much more, many high school seniors have missed out on half of their last year. No senior walk, prom, or in some cases, graduation.
   
 In the midst of this global pandemic, many people have adjusted to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
   
 Plainview seniors Cody Marr, Drake Sisemore and Tyler Berryhill signed their National Letter of Intent on May 19 at Caddo Street BBQ, which is locally owned and operated by Bryan Marr.
   
 Cody Marr, Plainview High School senior, is signing to play football at Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois.
   
 "I'm excited and nervous to sign today. This is what I've wanted to do my whole life, and now it's actually in front of me," Cody Marr said "It's definitely nerve-wracking. I am sad however, that I'm not getting to do it at the school, or see all my family, friends and coaches on this special day, because they truly helped me get where I am today."
   
 Tyler Berryhill is signing to play football at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater.
   
 "Signing today means a lot to me, because I didn't get to do it during school," Berryhill said. "I am fortunate enough to be able to do it now. I still wish we were on campus, but the Corona Virus had to ruin everything."
   
 His passion for football began at a very young age.
   
 "I have been playing tackle football since the fourth grade, and before that, I played flag football. I've always been involved in sports and mainly focused on football and basketball as I grew up," Berryhill said. "I soon began to realize as I entered high school how much more I loved football than any other sport. It is the activity that I enjoy most at any given time. There's something about Friday night lights that you just can't beat. Personally, I believe that football has made me a better man and will continue to develop me as I progress through college ball."
   
 Drake Sisemore will sign to play baseball at Butler Community College in El Dorado, Kansas.
   
 Sisemore said, "I decided to go out of state because the coaching staff was great, and it was the best place for me to improve. I took a visit/school tour in February. The campus was really nice and I loved the school atmosphere."
   
 Sisemore has been hitting the ball for years now.
   
 "I started out playing baseball when I was about six years old. To me, it is about being part of a team and the competition," Sisemore said. "At some time or another, baseball beats everyone, so in every inning, you want to come out on top. It's my passion for sure, the ultimate team sport,"
   
 Bryan Marr, Caddo Street restaurant owner and father of Cody Marr helped make Tuesday's college signing happen for the trio of athletes.
   
 "We wanted to do something for the kids, because as soon as they decided where they wanted to go, the pandemic hit, and they didn't have a place to sign. We worked with the school and the health department and came up with a plan that was functional and safe for everyone."
   
 Despite COVID-19, Bryan Marr believes that Plainview has done an excellent job in finding ways to celebrate the class of 2020.
   
 "The school has done a really good job of keeping the kids safe while still trying to make, to me, their senior year special for them," Bryan Marr said. "They have done what they think is best for the kids, and as a parent, that's all you can ask for."
   
 Several school officials took time out of their day to show up and support the young men.
   
 "It definitely shows the Plainview spirit and what we are about. These coaches are not only looking out for their athletes, but their students as well. They've always supported these kids, and Coach Price especially. He always says his job doesn't end after football season," Bryan Marr said. "I think Price has done a great job of preparing the kids for their future endeavors. We sent a plan of action to the school that was approved by the health department so the school could participate and follow all those guidelines as well. Even though it wasn't technically a school event, we're just going to go ahead and call it that, because they were all involved. It was a great turnout."
   
 Plainview's Athletic Director David Gilliam knows how special a signing day is, because he had one of his own.
   
 "I went to Northeastern State in Tahlequah, and I played football there. I, myself, had a big signing day," Gilliam said. "It's a strange situation on how everything's turned out with COVID-19, but I'm just happy that the Marr family and the Sisemore family stepped up and allowed us to have it off school grounds at Caddo Street. I'm glad that they got a chance to at least experience the signing day atmosphere. Obviously I would have liked to have it at school where you get everybody in there and it's a bigger thing, but at least we have people that stepped up so the kids can have their moment."
   
 Gilliam also gave a bit of advice to incoming college freshman student athletes.
   
 "I would say sit back and learn. You go from a relatively small pond to a large one when you get to college; you're getting good athletes from everywhere," Gilliam said. "Listen and learn from the upperclassmen, because they're willing to help teach you, and show you the ropes. Lastly, don't be afraid to ask questions."

During "Fox Sports Rádio" this Thursday, commentator Flávio Gomes condemned Flamengo's return to training, despite disrespecting the orders of the City of Rio de Janeiro. According to the journalist, the club is disrespecting common sense.- What Flamengo is doing is disrespecting common sense. Even though there is no law prohibiting training for soccer games, all sports clubs in Rio de Janeiro are closed. Nobody can go to sports clubs. Nobody can play ball on the court of the building. Nobody can do sports activities because, as they are not essential, they are not allowed - he said.

He used the analogy of driving: People die every year from traffic accidents, but people are still allowed to use the highways, within certain rules.
 "What is that right speed to allow people to go back to a more normal life, and still preserve (access to) the health care system," the governor said.
 He thanked Nebraskans for their "sacrifices," which have allowed for the relaxing of rules, while continuing to urge people to wear masks in public places and maintain a six-foot separation from others.
 The move comes one day after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds unveiled a relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in her state that included opening bars, and after a group of Omaha bar owners hired a well-known trial attorney to explore whether Ricketts could legally impose restrictions on lounges but not liquor outlets that also sold food.
 A leading state senator urged caution Thursday, saying the State of Nebraska still hadn't reached the level of testing for the coronavirus that has been recommended before loosening restrictions.
 "There are other states who have started to do this, and it would probably benefit us to be more cautious and see what their experience is until we stumbled into another infection," said State Sen. Steve Lathrop of Omaha.
 The new rules are going to be hard to enforce, Lathrop predicted, especially since some people think the pandemic "is nonsense."
 Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert, meanwhile, said that she thought the governor's actions have been well thought out, and guided by medical experts in the state. But ultimately, it will be up to Nebraskans to continue to follow social distancing advice.
 "At the end of the day, we need people to be responsible," she said.​
 Ricketts voiced optimism that Nebraskans will voluntarily comply with the new guidelines. So far they have, by and large, he said, and have been cautious when rules have been relaxed.
 As far as enforcement, the governor said that the state doesn't have enough law enforcement officers to police the rules. "People don't want police on their doorstep," he said. "We want voluntary compliance."
 Ricketts has often said that his "north star" in managing the coronavirus is avoiding spikes in infections so that there are plenty of hospital beds and ventilators available. In recent weeks, he's used a bench mark of maintaining at least 30% of hospital resources before relaxing restrictions.

Even as the country begins to reopen, it is unlikely that these new risks will disappear. Employers are still finalizing return-to-work plans for restarting their on-site operations. Moreover, many employers have realized that productivity has not decreased with a switch to telework operations and, in light of the cost benefits associated with teleworking, those employers may plan to maintain the arrangement, for at least portions of their workforces, well after the public health emergency subsides. Given that the increased risk of information theft is not going away, it is important to review several practices that can limit exposure.

Kirk Webster practices holistic beekeeping in Vermont. His specialty is queen breeding, so he wanted no part of the mite treatments, which destroy the fertility of drones (male bees) and queens. He understood that the more we used chemicals to try to treat bees’ ills, the less the bees were going to have to come up with their own solutions, which would be more sustainable (and cheaper!) in the long run. So he simply stopped using chemical treatments of any kind and let 90+ percent of his bees die. Then he took the few survivors, who happened to have some genetic resistance to the mites, and bred them together. Basically, he did to the mites exactly what the mites had done to the beekeepers. After the better part of a decade he had developed lines of bees with strong natural mite resistance. They also seemed to be more resilient toward other factors. They are supremely good survivors, and they are wildly in demand. And all Kirk had to do was go without income for a decade to get there! This is just one area where we can find the answers to problems within natural systems, or impose them from without, which is always a short-term fix.
