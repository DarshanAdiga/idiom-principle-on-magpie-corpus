On the occasion of her 134th birth anniversary, some of her poignant words come to mind: “Any art and culture worth surviving will certainly hold its own against all times and against all conditions. Our attempt should be to free it from its ugly associations and the incrustations of ages which now keeps it dim and repulsive to many so that the divine art may be learned and practiced by all. Then only India’s art, the rich legacy of ages will shine brighter and will command the respect and admiration of the world — a rather succinct word of advice in the prevailing times.

That cousin told 19 news there were three children, two boys, and a girl.“I know they were trying to get out of this neighborhood and move out to the country somewhere and he just wanted to stay busy with the kids and keep them out of trouble so none of this is making any sense, were just lost right now,” Runyon said.Runyon said when his cousin didn't show up to work today his boss came to check on him at their house and he found shell casings in the driveway and no one was answering the phone or the door.“They were a typical family. They kept the three kids busy. They were in baseball and volleyball and soccer and ballet. There was two boys and a girl and the wife worked as a nurse and he worked down the road at a plastic bag factory and he lived here his entire life. He was 44 years old.”19 News also spoke with a neighbor who said she heard gunshots last night.“I thought it was fireworks at first, but it was gunshots. My husband jumped up out of bed, he said those were gunshots,” said Renetta Hubbard.Hubbard has lived next door for more than 20 years.“I just feel so bad that maybe if I would’ve called yesterday, I could’ve saved somebody,” Hubbard said while choking back tears.Another neighbor said her 12-year-old daughter was the same age as their daughter and they would play together in the family’s back yard.“Very sad,” said Josalyn Woolfork. “Very sad, you just never know what people are going through.”Woolfork also said she had seen the couple arguing outside recently and in some cases, the wife would leave but she never thought much of it.

And don’t get us wrong, 90Hz is faster than the iPhone and makes a noticeable difference. It pairs nicely with the Full HD+ OLED panel that is quite vibrant while still delivering deep blacks. The sloped left and right still present issues here: When you have a white or lighter background screen, the edges bleed through. Essentially, the left and right side appear much darker or have an incorrect amount of light shining through on the edges. That’s likely due to the OLED panel and how it lights the edges from the same core panel underneath the glass. These sides still reflect light as well, and the fix is repositioning how you hold the Edge.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said COVID-19 was now under some measure of control in the UK, but a resurgence of the coronavirus in some European countries made clear that the pandemic was not over.
 "This country has had a massive success now in reducing the numbers of those tragic deaths, and we've got it at the moment under some measure of control," he said on Thursday."But I have to tell you that we are looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries and you can see what's been happening in the United States, and so it is absolutely vital as a country that we continue to keep our focus and our discipline, and that we don't delude ourselves that somehow we are out of the woods or that that is all over because it isn't all over."

Muthulakshmi was enrolled at a local thinnai, or a school run out of a portico. When she decided to study further, young boys ran behind the bullock cart she travelled in, screaming that a Devaradial (Devadasi in Tamil) is going to school. Soon after, all hell broke loose in Pudukkottai, which back then, only had a high school for boys. Some parents threatened to withdraw their sons from the school, stating that the presence of a girl born to a Devadasi would corrupt their minds, even after a curtain was drawn between the three girls and 40 boys in the class. A teacher decided to resign as well. But the Maharaja of Pudukkottai went on to support Muthulakshmi and gave her a handsome scholarship of Rs 150 when she expressed her desire to study medicine in Madras.

By Chandan Taparia Nifty opened positive on Thursday, but failed to surpass the 11,300 mark. After an early consolidation, the index fell sharply towards the 11,100 mark. It formed a bearish candle on the last session of July F&O; expiry and saw a lowest daily close in eight sessions. Technical indicators like the RSI have seen a negative crossover from the overbought scenario on the daily scale, which doesn’t bode well for the bulls. A failure to break out above the 11,300 level and sustained selling pressure at higher level indicate that the market may see profit taking in the near term. However, the index has multiple supports at 11,050 level and a hold below the 11,050 mark could confirm more decline towards 10,900 level and the 10,800-10,750 zone, while on the upside, resistance exists at 11,250 and then 11,300 levels. India VIX moved up 2.56 per cent to 24.72 level. Any spike in volatility can trigger some decline, but overall lower VIX is ruling out any major fall in the market for the time being. Since it is the beginning of a new series, options data lay scattered at various strike prices. Maximum Put open interest was seen at 11,000 followed by 10,000 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 level. Marginal Call writing was seen at 11,200 and 11,300 levels, while there was Put writing at 11,000 and then 10,700 levels. Option data suggested a wider trading range between 10,700 and 11,500 levels. Bank Nifty opened positive, but failed to move above 22,250 level and drifted sharply in the second half of the session towards the 21,600 mark. The index formed a bearish candle and come back to the 50-day EMA after a bounce in last two sessions, which indicated underperformance and a weak structure. The banking index is showing tiredness and every bounce is getting sold into leading to the emergence of a negative price setup on the weekly scale. If the index holds below 22,000 level, then weakness may be seen towards 21,000 level and even lower, while on the upside immediate hurdles have shifted to the 22,250-22,350 zone. Nifty futures closed negative at 11,101 with a 1.08 per cent loss. Positive trade setup was seen in Apollo Hospital, Divi's Labs, Dr Reddy's, NIIT Tech, Sun Pharma, Wipro, ACC, Mindtree and Infosys while the structures were weak in Manapurram Finance, BPCL, Indiabulls Housing, RBL Bank, Equitas, HDFC , PNB and Axis Bank.

LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - An Iowa, La. man is thanking a group of first responders who literally brought him back to life earlier this year. Preston Manuel believes the 3 police officers and fireman who responded to his February accident are Hometown Heroes.On February 11, 2020, Preston Manuel was heading home on Interstate 10 in Sulphur. A.J. Powell had left work a little early at the Sulphur Police Department and was right behind Manuel.It was at the intersection of I-10 and Cities Service Highway that Officer Powell noticed Manuel weaving in and out of traffic at only 30 miles per hour."He probably thought I was drunk," joked Manuel. "Weaving in and out of traffic? He thought I was drunk and needed to stop me."Powell witnessed Manuel's car being struck by an 18-wheeler and getting pushed into a construction barrier. He got out of his car to check on Manuel."His door is locked," recalled Powell. "He's slumped over the center console. I can't get the door open. I knew he was having some issues so I break the window, unlock the door and open it. I go to feel for a pulse and I really don't feel any. He's kind of gagging. I thought, man he's having a heart attack."Powell called for assistance and began CPR immediately. Sulphur police officers Benton Barnett and Justin Duplichain arrived along with firefighter Richard Wingard. They rotated with Powell to try and revive Manuel."You know, somebody saves your life, that means a lot," said Manuel. "These guys, they worked on me about 10 minutes."Powell is a 14 year veteran of the Sulphur Police Department and teaches CPR at the Training Academy. He knows he and the other first responders were at the right place at the right time."God's gonna do whatever he's gonna do," said Powell. "An EMT or paramedic's job is just to entertain him until He decides. So apparently He wasn't done with him and I just kept him entertained until He figured out maybe they're not done and he'll stick around."I'm telling you straight, I owe my life to them," said Manuel.Manuel says he still has very little memory of what happened but is thankful Officer Powell was behind him that day. He could be facing triple bypass surgery this fall. Manuel says he’s looking foward to taking his 4 CPR heroes out to lunch one day.Copyright 2020 KPLC. All rights reserved.

30 July 2020, Sonipat The Jindal Global Law School JGLS of O.P. Jindal Global University has taken an extraordinary initiative to appoint ten distinguished Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court of India as Honorary Adjunct Professors of Law and Distinguished Professors of Legal Practice. JGLS has launched a new and path breaking initiative under the aegis of the LEAD Programme Lawyering Excellence for Advocacy Development. The objective of the LEAD Programme is to inspire outstanding law students through teaching and learning experiences led by distinguished legal practitioners that will help them consider joining the legal profession with a special focus on litigation with a view to joining the bar and the bench. Each Senior Advocate will teach one specialized law course. The Senior Advocates who are part of the LEAD Programme are 1. Mr. Gourab Banerji, 2. Mr. Sidharth Luthra, 3. Mr. Gaurav Pachnanda, 4. Mr. Mohan Parasaran, 5. Mr. Sajan Poovayya, 6. Mr. Ritin Rai, 7. Dr. Surat Singh, 8. Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, 9. Mr. Parag Tripathi, Ms. Neelima Tripathi, Advocate, Supreme Court of India 10. Mr. R. Venkataramani The vision of the LEAD Programme, Professor Dr. C. Raj Kumar, Founding Vice Chancellor. O.P. Jindal Global University and Dean, Jindal Global Law School said was to identify some of the most outstanding members of the legal profession to teach a course to the senior students of law, with a view to educating and inspiring them. The larger purpose of this effort is to instil in the minds of budding lawyers an imagination to become part of the legal profession with a stronger focus on legal practice and litigation. At a time when the legal profession is seeking outstanding talent for being part of the litigating bar and the judiciary, we need to reimagine the existing paradigm of legal education. We need to focus on creating a new generation of lawyers who are prepared to accept the challenges of legal profession are are willing to be part of it by making this as a preferred choice after the legal studies. Each Honorary Adjunct Professor will teach a 1-credit course on an advanced area of law and legal practice. The courses will span over a period of 8 weeks starting from 5th September 2020 Teachers Day. According to Professor Dr. Sreejith S.G., Professor of Law and Executive Dean, Jindal Global Law School, the courses taught by the Honorary Adjunct Professors will become the mainstay of JGLSLEAD Programme which is going to be launched from Fall 2020. The LEAD Programme aims to further the Schools commitment to provide its students the legal imagination which has highest constitutive and professional potential. The LEAD Programme in general creates an opportunity for the students of JGLS to be taught by leading practitioners from the legal profession which include senior counsels, and eminent litigators. The courses taught by the Senior Counsels will be 1-credit 15 hours elective courses which will be held online for two hours every weekend for 8 weeks. The courses will be open only for the graduating batch of 2021. Professor Sreejith S.G. explained that the reason for limiting the courses by the Senior Counsels to the graduating batch is that students take these course at a stage when their knowledge of substantive law, which can be obtained in a law school framework, is at its maximum. Apart from the academic and intellectual outcomes the association with the Senior Counsels would bring, adds Professor C. Raj Kumar, we are also motivated by the need to recognize and honour their outstanding contributions to the field of law, legal practice and for advancing the cause of legal profession and public service. Their passion, commitment, and dedication to the practice of law, especially their contribution to promoting excellence in legal education will be truly inspiring for the students of JGLS

We rescinded the rule three days ago so enjoy your life ladies and gentlemen enjoy. Housing and urban development secretary Dan Carson argued the rule was unworkable and ultimately a waste of time for localities to comply with. But critics say the president is trying to stoke racial division and appeal to white suburban voters with fewer than a hundred days until the election. Leon Castro the housing secretary under President Obama blasted the move. These guys are men a couple of years later and they put it on ice and say no though her we're gonna go forward.

Escorts Ltd (Escorts) has significant exposure to the rural economy through its tractor division where it is one of the prominent players thereby commanding domestic market share at ~ 11.6% as of FY20. We expect the tractor segment to stay largely unaffected by demand side issues being faced by the rest of the automotive industry amidst Covid-19 outbreak, courtesy stability in the outlook of rural incomes (on the back of good Rabi crop harvest, remunerative crop prices, healthy water table levels and normal monsoon 2020) and lack of regulatory disruption like BS-VI norms. Longer term demand drivers like the government's continued focus on doubling farm incomes and improving rural infrastructure as well as underpenetrated nature of farm mechanisation in India stay intact. Escorts derives ~77% of its sales from the tractor segment with rest being constituted by construction equipment (~15% of sales) and railways (~8% of sales) Domestic tractor segment is outpacing rest of the automotive space by a wide margin after lifting of nationwide lockdown. July retail volumes are ~20% higher than pre Covid levels (vs. ~40% decline for the overall industry), and up ~9% YoY, ~33% MoM - showcasing the robustness of demand on ground.

China is stepping up testing for COVID-19 in an attempt to get a handle on new outbreaks that have defied the country's considerable success in containing the coronavirus that was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. In the northeastern city of Dalian, authorities issued a open letter urging all 5.6 million residents to get tested following consecutive days of new cases. As of midnight Wednesday, samples had been collected from more than 4 million people, and a second round of tests is being launched in high-risk areas. Extensive testing has also been carried out in Urumqi, where more than 100 specialists from the Centers for Disease Control are investigating the outbreak. Leading epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan also urged tests to be carried out on every one of Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents following a new wave of infections that is adding around 100 new cases per day. The city's Hospital Authority says it's planning to adapt an exhibition centre into a community treatment facility.
