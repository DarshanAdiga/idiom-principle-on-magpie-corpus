An anti-slavery campaigner who was sold to Europeans for “a gun, a piece of cloth, and some lead” has been honoured with a blue plaque.
 Ottobah Cugoano was kidnapped in 1770 while playing with other children in a field.
 A decade later, while working as a servant in London, he penned a “radical” book calling for slavery’s immediate abolition and the emancipation of slaves.
 Cugoano, the earliest black figure to receive an official blue plaque, was the first African to publicly demand total abolition of the slave trade.
 Thoughts And Sentiments On The Evil And Wicked Traffic Of The Slavery And Commerce Of The Human Species was one of the first black-authored anti-slavery books to be published in Britain.
 It took on a key argument used by apologists for slavery – the complicity of Africans in the trade.
 He invited readers to imagine slave raids on Britain by African pirates, “assisted by some of your own insidious neighbours, for there may be some men even among you vile enough to do such a thing if they could get money by it”.
 And he wrote that “the difference of colour and complexion, which it hath pleased God to appoint among men, are no more unbecoming than the different shades of the rainbow are unseemly to the whole …
 “It does not alter the nature or quality of a man, whether he wears a black or white coat – whether he puts it on or strips it off, he is still the same man.”
 The plaque is being installed by English Heritage at Schomberg House, 80–82 Pall Mall, where Cugoano worked as a servant.
 Cugoano was born in a village on the coast of Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast.
 After being kidnapped, he and other slaves were transported to the West Indies and he later told how desperate captives tried to sink the boat as they preferred death to life on board.
 Cugoano is thought to have been brought to England by a prominent slave owner after a brutal period of enslavement in Grenada.
 He decided “to learn reading and writing, which soon became my recreation, pleasure, and delight” but little is known of how he gained his freedom.
 By 1784, he was employed as a servant and two years later he was campaigning against slavery and became a leader of Georgian London’s black community.
 The English Heritage Blue Plaques Panel member, broadcaster and historian David Olusoga, said: “Ottobah Cugoano was a remarkable man, one who himself had known the horrors of slavery.
 “Having survived he used words and arguments to fight against the slave trade and slavery.
 “Cugoano was a true pioneer – the first African to demand the total abolition of slavery and one of the leaders of Georgian London’s black community. I am delighted that English Heritage is celebrating his life with a blue plaque.”
 Schomberg House on Pall Mall was mentioned in the frontispiece of the 1787 edition of Thoughts And Sentiments.
 The 18th Century campaigner disappeared from the historical record in 1791 and historians do not know if he died that year.
 English Heritage says that only 4% of the 950-plus blue plaques in London are dedicated to black and Asian figures from history, partly because of a lack of historic records to establish a definitive link between people and the building in which they lived.
 “That we have these definitive links for Cugoano and that the historic building survives in a form that he would have recognised, means that this is a very rare opportunity to honour a black Londoner of the 18th Century,” it said.

He focused instead on the arrival of a new antibody drug similar to a treatment President Donald Trump received after contracting the virus last month. But supply of the drug, called bamlanivimab, is scarce for now. The largest hospital in the Rio Grande Valley, DHR Health, had 38 doses that it could begin administering soon as Friday, said Dr. Sohail Rao, president and CEO of DHR Health Institute for Research & Development.
 The therapy is only approved for people 12 and older with mild or moderate COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization, and who are at higher risk of severe illness from the virus, including people who are diabetic or obese. Texas received about 5,700 vials of the drug, second only to Illinois.
 “We are quite enthusiastic that we have this antibody,” Rao said. “But what will be a limiting factor is the number of doses released by the state, which also depends on how much they get from the federal government.”
 In closing the door on more shutdowns, Abbott said the virus is spreading in social settings beyond businesses. He also singled out El Paso — where Texas has rushed more than 1,200 additional medical personnel, and 10 mobile morgues are in place to handle the dead — suggesting county leaders on the border aren’t enforcing existing restrictions as they try shutting down gyms and tattoo parlors.

While there have been improvements in treatment protocols and new therapeutics, tens of thousands of people -- or more -- will die before vaccines are widely available, she said.
 After the virtual meeting with the governors, Biden took questions from reporters and revealed he'd decided on a treasury secretary nomination for his new administration. He refused to provide more details, except to say it was a choice that would satisfy Democrats from across the political spectrum -- presumably including outspoken progressives who worried Biden might go for a safer, more moderate selection.
 Among the Democrats on the videoconference was Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, which is among the states Trump has targeted for unfounded claims of voter fraud. Biden nonetheless vowed to rise above politics in a unified front against the virus.
 "There's a real desire for real partnership between the states and the federal government," Biden said.
 He said he'd forgo a national shutdown "because every region, every area, every community can be different."
 Instead, Biden noted that 10 governors have imposed statewide mask mandates to combat the virus, calling wearing face coverings a "patriotic duty." He's previously vowed to ask all governors to impose such rules and go around holdouts to local and county officials to cover as much of the U.S. as possible.
 Ivey told videoconference participants that both parties in Congress need to come together to provide more coronavirus response funding, according to a readout provided by her office. It made no mention of the Alabama governor recognizing Biden as president-elect.
 Hutchison of Arkansas, by contrast, said over the weekend that Biden would be the next president. He's also called on the Trump administration to give Biden access to the intelligence briefings he needs to be fully prepared to lead the country on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.
 Hogan told The Associated Press recently that Trump's wild and unsupported claims of widespread voter fraud were "dangerous" and "embarrassing."
 "As I said on the day that the president-elect was declared the winner, his election has provided a mandate for cooperation," the Maryland governor said after the virtual meeting with Biden. "We look forward to working closely with the Biden-Harris administration as we continue to face this unprecedented global pandemic."
 Still, some in his party considering the election settled didn't stop Trump on Thursday from coming out with a new round of false claims of voter fraud in key states.
 With Trump dug in and Republicans on Capitol Hill largely unwilling to challenge him, Biden has been forced to turn to a diverse collection of outside allies to ratchet up the pressure on the president to concede.
 The CEOs of America's largest companies have released a statement recognizing Biden and Harris as the clear winners. The heads of the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association issued a joint statement on Tuesday urging the Trump administration to share "all critical information related to COVID-19" with Biden. Not doing so, they warned, would jeopardize American lives.
 Trump, meanwhile, has been getting nowhere in the courts, and his scattershot effort to overturn Biden's victory is shifting toward obscure election boards that certify the vote. The battle is centered in the states that sealed Biden's win. Two Republican election officials in Michigan's largest county initially refused to certify results despite no evidence of fraud.
 The officials then backtracked and voted to certify before flipping again and saying they "remain opposed to certification."
 Biden said that Trump's refusal to accept the election results has left Americans "witnessing incredible irresponsibility" and that the president's actions in Michigan were particularly troubling.
 "What the president's doing now is going to be another incident where he will go down in history as being one of the most irresponsible presidents," Biden said.

 People expect the Veltri dinner to look the same every year, Strickland said, which also complicated the planning process.
 “Planning an event that is really a Charleston institution and a Thanksgiving tradition for a lot of people is difficult," she said. "People don’t like seeing change.”
 Volunteers for the dinner date back to the days of Veltri himself, who died in 2001. Strickland said the volunteers have turned the dinner into a “well-oiled machine,” with the cooking and prep process becoming choreographed. Strickland has worked on the dinner for the past 15 years.
 “My extended family know they’re not going to see me until 2 or 3 in the afternoon because I’m doing the Veltri dinner,” Strickland said about normal Thanksgiving Days.
 Strickland still delivers to the high-rise her grandmother used to live in before she died. She said that, like many other longtime volunteers, it’s the people who always bring everyone back.
 “The sweetness and the gratitude of the people that I get the privilege to deliver Thanksgiving dinner to is just amazing,” she said.
 The hope is that, by Thanksgiving 2021, all will be back to normal and the dinner will return to an in-person gathering, Strickland said. Whether that’s possible, she added, only time will tell.
 Regardless, the Veltri dinner is happening in 2020 because of these dedicated community members — gathering or no gathering.
 “It’s not something that just happens," Strickland said, "it’s something our community members and volunteers are invested in.”

González said it's "possible" after that process "that a portion of the dollars" still go to bridge maintenance.
 While there are merits to transit and bike causes, they are already generously funded by the city. Seattle taxpayers also just approved a sales tax that will generate more than $26 million a year for a variety of bus and non-car spending.
 Caving to groups wanting ever more, instead of promptly funding maintenance and avoiding more pollution-causing closures, could be self-interest: Advocacy groups and labor organizations behind them heavily support loyal politicians.
 Keep those politicians in mind when the next bridge breaks and you're stuck on an endless bus ride or in a traffic jam and can't get to work on time, have to leave a child waiting in the dark for a ride or deliver a baby en route to the hospital.
 In the meantime, the council must reconsider its shortsighted decision again to shortchange bridge maintenance so it can dole out more to special interests.
 If this public need wasn't obvious after the West Seattle Bridge failure and the city audit, it's overwhelmingly clear now that Seattle is committing to a repair job that will consume much of its meager maintenance budget for decades.
 Durkan said she will ask regional, state and federal governments to help pay for the West Seattle Bridge project.
 That might be a reasonable request if City Hall finds the willpower to prioritize maintenance of such critical assets over the extended hands of political allies.

Quite often it's very easy to see that a lot of actors have become typecast in a way since they end up taking on the same roles, more or less, in a lot of movies and thus have a definite type of character that they enjoy playing. But there are movies in which they decide to take on a role that goes against their usual type and ends up being pretty interesting since it tests the actors in a manner that makes it clear as to whether they can diversify or not when it comes to their overall act. Some actors do just fine and can be every bit as convincing in a different role while others make it obvious that they're not in their comfort zone and don't know how to deal with it. Those that do manage to do this successfully aren't always as rewarded for their efforts since due to various reasons some folks might not appreciate the act all that much, or it could be that the movie isn't considered to be one of their better efforts. No matter what happens though, seeing someone turn the corner to try and take on a very different role than they're used to is interesting, and when it works it's absolutely stunning.

“It wasn’t a comfortable decision, but I knew that I would fit in (at Notre Dame) and I could grow to be the best person that I can be on and off the field,” Kia said. “There were other schools that were really hard to say no just because I felt like I would be really comfortable there. But going to Notre Dame and accepting that challenge was something I wanted to do and further myself academically and athletically.”
 On the Irish, Kia projects as an inside linebacker. 247Sports pegs Kia as its No. 61 outside linebacker and No. 924 overall player in the 2021 class. He joins a 22-player recruiting class that ranks No. 9 and No. 10 nationally on 247Sports and Rivals, respectively.
 The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Kia comes from Punahou School in Honolulu. His parents — mother Emmalei and father Nate — both attended Utah. Nate played for the Utes as a defensive lineman from 1993-96. They were the first Division I program to offer a scholarship to Kahanu in September 2019.
 Notre Dame did not join the mix until approximately a year later, offering Kia on Sept. 1. UCLA and Stanford were among others schools Kia considered. The Irish are unlike the rest, Kia said.
 “It was both the academics and athletics. It’s the best combination of both,” Kia said. “But I think too, they don’t offer a lot of people. They have really unique players in that both on and off the field is really important to them. Not to say anything bad about other players. I just think that it’s a different type of student-athlete at Notre Dame that I want to be surrounded by.”
 After passing at the position in the 2020 recruiting class, Notre Dame initially looked to add just one linebacker this cycle. The Irish heavily pursued only a couple linebackers and appeared to be done at the position after receiving a commitment from Jonesborough (Tenn.) David Crockett’s Prince Kollie in August.
 Unforeseen roster attrition hit the Irish, opening up a few more spots this class. That includes Jordan Genmark Heath committing to a transfer in September before landing at UCLA. Then Notre Dame recruited Kia.
 Notre Dame’s coaching staff told Kia he was the only linebacker they would pursue for the rest of the cycle, he said. Irish defensive coordinator Clark Lea, recruiting/special teams coordinator Brian Polian and defensive analyst Nick Lezynski headed his recruitment.
 “They were really honest,” Kia said. “They weren’t trying to sell me any fluff or anything like that. They really made it seem like they wanted me and felt like I would be a really good piece to this class. That is what really stuck out to me.”
 As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Kia plans to serve a two-year mission while at Notre Dame. Other football programs wanted Kia to leave for his mission after graduating high school. Not the Irish. He will play his final high school season next semester before graduating and joining the Irish in June.
 Then Kia will be a member of Notre Dame’s football program for one year before departing for his mission. He will return for his second season in 2024.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — As Texas shattered a single-day record with 12,000 new coronavirus cases reported, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ruled out another lockdown and accused local leaders of not enforcing existing restrictions.
 His rejection of a shutdown comes as other governors across the U.S. take aggressive new steps to curb record-shattering spikes in COVID-19 cases that are pushing hospitals to the limit. Texas is on the verge of surpassing 8,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients for the first time since a deadly summer outbreak, which back then Abbott met with orders that closed bars and limited restaurant occupancy.
 But during a visit to hard-hit Lubbock, where the local health authority says the fire department is building shelves for the dead as morgues run short on space, Abbott made clear Texas will not retreat to lockdown measures again.
 “It is important for everybody in the state to know that, statewide, we're not going to have another shutdown,” Abbott said. “There's an overestimation of exactly what a shutdown will achieve.”
 He focused instead on the arrival of a new antibody drug similar to a treatment President Donald Trump received after contracting the virus last month. But supply of the drug, called bamlanivimab, is scarce for now. The largest hospital in the Rio Grande Valley, DHR Health, had 38 doses that it could begin administering soon as Friday, said Dr. Sohail Rao, president and CEO of DHR Health Institute for Research & Development.

“They want me to come here first just so I can put my feet in the water, academically and athletically, just so I know what I’m coming into,” Kia said. “For that first year, I’m not going to be thinking about the mission. I just want to come there and be the best that I can be and try to get on the field as much as possible.
 “I don’t want it to be, ‘I’m just going to leave on my mission and this year is kind of a waste.’ I want it to be a meaningful year where I can prove my worth before I go on my mission.”
 The Hawaii and Punahou pipeline at Notre Dame continues through Kia. Punahou produced former Irish linebacker Manti Te’o, who led Notre Dame to a national championship appearance as a Heisman Trophy finalist in 2012. Two of Te’o’s Hawaiian teammates, wide receiver Robby Toma and the late defensive lineman Kona Schwenke, secured significant roles on the Irish.
 Safety Alohi Gilman and defensive tackle Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa, two multi- year starters, highlight Notre Dame’s more recent Hawaii success. Sophomore linebacker Marist Liufau and freshman defensive end Jordan Botelho comprise the current Irish players from Hawaii. Liufau has received plenty of high- leverage snaps this season. Botelho has impressed as a special teams player.
 Liufau has the strongest connection with Kia. They were teammates at Punahou.
 “That definitely played a big part in my recruitment,” Kia said. “He is happy there. He is loving his experience there. The thing that he told me and what I could definitely see is the trust that he has in the coaches. Coach Lea, coach Nick, coach Polian, all of those guys, he loves and trusts them. The players too, how much he loves being around the players. He talks about the culture of the team, and I can definitely see it.”
 That culture became apparent to Kia when he visited Notre Dame for the first time during the weekend of the Clemson game. Kia could not tour the facilities or have face-to-face contact with the coaching staff under the dead period rules. The NCAA’s dead-period mandate lasts through April 15. But he could take a do-it-yourself trip.
 From touring the campus to seeing Notre Dame Stadium from the outside, Kia knew this was the place he wanted to be. Even if his childhood was spent thinking about somewhere else.
 “It was kind of hard coming to grips with, ‘Dang, I’m not going to the place I always thought I was going to go to: my childhood dream school.’ But at the end of the day, it’s a business,” Kia said. “Notre Dame is going to be my home for the future.”
 “I think football-wise, they are both top tier. Obviously Notre Dame is No. 2 in the nation, and that’s awesome. The path they are going on is trending upward.
 “But what it was, was the academics, the power of the degree at the school and what I can get from it, and the players themselves and the connections I felt with them.”

Four Minnesotans selected in Wednesday’s draft
 Tre Jones, who helped Apple Valley High School teams win two of their three state boys basketball championships, was selected by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round of the NBA Draft on Wednesday night.
 Jones played point guard for Eagles teams that won the 2015 and 2017 state Class 4A championships and finished second in 2018. He becomes the third Apple Valley player from that era to enter the NBA, joining his brother Tyus Jones, a guard with the Memphis Grizzlies, and Gary Trent Jr. of the Portland Trail Blazers.
 He went to the Spurs with the 41st pick overall and was one of four Minnesota natives to be drafted. Lakeville native Zeke Nnaji, who played in high school for Hopkins and in college for Arizona, went to Denver with the 22nd pick of the first round. Nnaji (7-0, 240 pounds) can play center or forward. Draft analysts say he will bring energy and offensive rebounding ability to the Nuggets and is a developing offensive player.
 Also selected in the second round was De La Salle graduate Tyrell Terry, a point guard who went to Dallas with the first pick of the second round (31st overall). Terry played one season at Stanford University before declaring for the NBA Draft.
 Former Cretin-Derham Hall and University of Minnesota player Daniel Oturu was chosen by the Timberwolves with the 33rd pick overall but was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. Oturu, a center, played for the Cretin-Derham Hall team that won the 2018 Class 4A championship, defeating Jones’ Apple Valley team in the title game on an Oturu dunk at the buzzer.
 Jones played five seasons for varsity basketball for Apple Valley and is second all-time at the school in points and assists (Tyus Jones leads both categories). Tre Jones holds the school’s single-game scoring record of 48 points as well as the single-season rebounding record.
 He was a two-time Gatorade Minnesota Player of the Year. Jones played two seasons at Duke University and was named Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore.
 The 2020-21 NBA regular season is scheduled to begin Dec. 22.

"It's also about making sure you have the budget authority, you have the plans, and you have preparation and the understanding of the institutions to carry them out," McDonough said.
 He said he often ran into worried career employees on the street after Trump won in 2016. "A lot of people asked 'Should I stay?' And my answer always was, 'Uncle Sam needs you. We need apolitical experts advancing the national interest based on not ideology, not partisanship,' " he said.
 Biden is also expected to again put apolitical career diplomats into senior positions; under Trump, most were replaced with political appointees or acting officials.
 "It begins with appointments," said Uzra Zeya, a retired 27-year veteran diplomat who specialized in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. "It is a totally anomalous situation in the State Department's modern history to have exactly zero career officers as confirmed assistant secretaries of State. ... There are exactly zero African Americans at assistant secretary level or above."
 A swift recovery of lost talent and reinvigoration of those who remain is all the more important in light of the apparent drop in interest among young people to enter foreign service. The number of young potential diplomats taking the entrance exam for the foreign service plummeted from 20,000 in the early Obama years to fewer than 5,000 now.
 "You can start hiring people now at the entry level, but it could be, what, 10 years before they have real heavy experience under their belts," said Patrick F. Kennedy, a four-decade veteran of the State Department who was dismissed along with Thomas-Greenfield.
 The policies that a revived State Department will tackle include reentering multilateral global efforts that Trump eschewed, such as the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal. A Biden administration is expected to remain tough with China and Russia but mend fences with allies like Germany who Trump routinely dissed. And the new government will likely take a more balanced approach in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after Trump and his inner circle showered favors on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 Many former State Department workers are expected to eagerly return to their jobs, particularly under an administration that values their work.
 "The most important confidence-building step will be to have a president with a secretary of state who trusts the professionals and empowers them to do their jobs, instead of a daily dose of contempt," said Thomas Countryman, the former head of arms control who was dismissed with Thomas-Greenfield.
 Countryman received his pink slip while he was traveling in Jordan on State Department business.
 Getting back to having competent people in leadership and in ambassadorial positions could be achieved in four years, Countryman said. But, he added, "rebuilding confidence in U.S. diplomats among other governments could take longer."

The Frank Veltri Thanksgiving dinner, a Charleston tradition dating back 54 years, will go on this year despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
 There will be no mass gathering on Thanksgiving Day for the dinner this year. Instead, a team of drivers will deliver meals to those in need on Saturday.
 When Veltri started this tradition in 1966, he wanted to ensure that every senior, shut-in or vulnerable resident would eat a Thanksgiving meal with no questions asked. For Traci Strickland, executive director of the Kanawha Valley Collective and a longtime lead organizer for the Veltri dinner, there was zero chance this tradition would be killed by COVID-19.
 “Even knowing it looks very, very different this year, people are going to have Thanksgiving food for Thanksgiving,” Strickland said.
 First and foremost, she said, more volunteers are needed to make it happen. On Saturday beginning at 9:30 a.m., delivery drivers will hit the streets — but organizers still need more drivers to make sure every meal gets delivered, Strickland said.
 For those looking to help, there is a short volunteer sign-up sheet on the Veltri dinner’s Facebook page.
 Six hundred bags containing four Thanksgiving servings each will be delivered Saturday.
 Volunteers will spend Thursday and Friday preparing and packaging the meals, which include turkey breast, ham steak, green beans, corn, cranberry sauce, instant potatoes, stuffing, mini pies and bread.
 COVID-19 made planning the dinner quite difficult, Strickland said. The most dedicated volunteers started asking her in June if the dinner would happen at all this year.
 “For some of us, myself included, that was just really not a possibility as long as it’s possible to do,” she said. “So many people are not only used to it, but there’s people that rely on this dinner.”
 Now, with the day nearly here and West Virginians dying from COVID-19 at a rate faster than at any other time during the pandemic, Strickland said it was the right call to take the dinner mobile.

MILFORD — Although City Council’s Tuesday night retreat workshop was mostly focused on accounting matters, some time was taken to discuss the future of Milford’s economic development strategy.      Many council members made clear their desire to leave the Kent Economic Partnership, a countywide organization focused on bringing business to the area.      “I think KEP is a no-go. That’s my temperature on KEP,” said Councilman Andy Fulton.      “I tend to agree with Councilman Fulton,” said Councilman Todd Culotta. “We just got finished with a conversation about possible tax increases, combined with discussions about cost-cutting, so every dollar counts.”      Councilman Mike Boyle, who said he served on the KEP board for almost two years, also agreed.      “I had high hopes as I joined it, but as it went on longer and longer, I began to see that we were pigeonholed for medical,” he said. “They kind of focus all their energy on providing that for us.”      In place of its relationship with KEP, many want the city to create a new economic development and community engagement administrator position.      “We need to grow. We need to provide more services, more jobs and the opportunities for those who raise their families here to stay here with jobs,” Councilman Fulton said.      “If we have this person on our staff, they’re going to be selling Milford,” he said. “They’re not going to be selling Kent County or Sussex County. They’re going to be selling our city and following the goals and aspirations we set for them.”      The position would be “vital to the growth of Milford,” Councilman Culotta said.      “The first thing we’re responsible (for) as councilpeople is the needs of the citizens, and part of that is the growth of the community through bringing business, bringing jobs, bringing more revenue to the city,” he said.      “In my opinion, it’s not just all about growth but retention,” said City Manager Mark Whitfield.      “I don’t know which businesses out there may be struggling, but if we had a person that is in the city who they could come to and say, ‘Hey, I’m having some issues here. Is there any way the city could help us out?’ It would be much better to know that and offer help before the doors get shuttered, and 20, 30 or 50 people are out of work,” he said.      The community engagement element of the role was not discussed as fully.      “It will be great to have somebody involved in economic development, as well as community engagement,” Councilman Brian Baer said. “I think those two really go hand in hand.”      Councilman Culotta said it would be good to have a representative from the city who could help coordinate the different organizations in town working on economic development.      “Sometimes, some of the organizations in Milford that are working on the same goal tend to work in silos,” he said. “It’s good we would have a point of contact to help hold them together.”      One of those organizations, Downtown Milford Inc. — which is funded in part by the city — was another topic of discussion Tuesday night.      “Obviously, we all know the value they provide for the growth and operation of downtown,” Councilman Culotta said. “The events they conduct, between the farmers market, the various fairs and whatnot, are quite valuable.”      But Councilman Boyle identified it as an organization in flux.      “DMI, the last I heard, is operating with an interim director, and the president has decided to step aside,” he said. “Are they still a viable organization or are they going to go away?”      In August, Trish Gerken, DMI’s executive director, stepped down from her position to begin working as a public information officer for the Milford School District.      Since then, DMI has reportedly been in the process of vetting and hiring someone else to fill the position.      Mr. Whitfield heard anecdotally that “they have voted they want to continue. Apparently, there is another person who has stepped up and will take the president role next year. They would like to continue on.”      Councilman Culotta asked if the organization really needs to fill the currently vacant executive director position.      “The executive director, which is what Trish was, is a paid position which most of their funding goes to. … Is that still needed? Because they’ve had a lot of turnover in the position,” he said. “In the five years, I’ve been here (on council), there have been three or four executive directors.”      He wondered if the volunteer committees that make up DMI could continue doing their work without the parent organization.      But others on the council quickly came to DMI’s defense.      “I think I’m that only one who was on (DMI’s) board at one time when it was just getting off its feet, and there’s a lot of things you don’t know,” Councilman Dan Marabello said.      “You have to think of the things they do. Do you want to see them discontinued?” he asked. “The farmers market, the Bud & Bug Festival, the Ladybug (Music) Festival. They’re involved with downtown. This year, it’s hard to tell because of the pandemic.”      Councilman Boyle agreed.      “A lot of the positive publicity we get is really connected to their efforts,” he said. “I think we ought to really make it known to them that what we want to do is help them, help them to survive and grow, because if they do, our downtown businesses will.”      Ultimately, it was decided that DMI’s leadership should give a presentation on the present status of their organization to council.      “I can certainly ask DMI to come in,” Mr. Whitfield said. “I think they’re due a presentation to council.”      He also took the opportunity to discuss the status of Milford’s economic development fund.      “It was used for a number of years to fund the planning and economic development director’s position,” Mr. Whitfield said. “It also funded DMI and other activities.”      He said that at the end of the year, “there’s not going to be much left in that fund.”      Mr. Whitfield noted that the likely sale of two lots in the city-run business park will replenish the fund to a degree, but that there’s a finite number of additional lots.      “It’s not like we’re going to produce more lots there unless we buy another tract of land or obtain another tract of land to subdivide into an industrial park or a business park,” he said. “This could dry up.”      Councilman Culotta suggested that tax incentives could be a way to sell the remaining city-owned lots more quickly.      “I know those have taken a little longer than we’d like to liquidate. Tax revenue is important, but tax incentives can help grow revenue,” he said.      “Maybe as part of people purchasing those lots to be developed for job purposes, which was the original intent, we can look at tax incentives much like we did with Nationwide Healthcare as an incentive to get those properties sold,” Councilman Culotta said.      M   r. Whitfield liked this idea.      “Abating the taxes for a period of time might be enough of an incentive for someone to build a high-end office complex with high-paying jobs,” he said.      “Right now, we’re just mowing grass on it, and it’s costing us money,” Mr. Whitfield said. “Giving up that tax revenue for three to five to 10 years is really not that significant.”

Reviving America’s principle of self-determination
 Remember America? It used to be a shining example for people who believed in self-determination. A place where sink or swim meant that with a little effort or imagination a person could build a comfortable life for themselves in a community free from crime. Where education opened up the world of possibilities by celebrating achievement and providing functional knowledge. Since Obama these simple, functional concepts were lost to his planned divisiveness.
 Then came Donald Trump, he knew how to restore fiscal responsibility, reduce the insanity of excess taxation and regulation, rebuild the country internationally and give us a strong military for our mutual defense. He attacked the problematic southern border in a pragmatic way, as promised while addressing our need for national security internally as well as by reiterating the need for a new approach to invasion by “refugees.”
 President Trump gave us an example of what can be done to restore our envied lifestyle despite endless attacks from the infuriated radicals and their minions. However the election plays out, Donald Trump has shown both how easy and difficult it can be to resist attempts to destroy our nation. Support his efforts or we will become the failed state that had the potential to provide the world a working model of a truly great country.
 In 1776 the people were willing to pledge their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to establish this Nation. Many of them died or were financially ruined in that struggle but they all retained their sacred honor. Can we settle for less?

It's that seasoning that makes cooking with cast iron cookware so great. Not only does it protect the iron of the pan from rust, it also provides a cooking surface that's non-stick, naturally oiling, and keeps your food from interacting with the oil of the pan. Some people even say the seasoned pan imparts flavour. Here's the problem: since the season is all oil, hitting it with dishwashing liquid, then scrubbing it with a sponge and rinsing it with hot water causes those oils to break down and float away -- taking that protective coating and washing it very literally down the drain. It may be easy, but it's destructive.[clear]

Every recruiting cycle there is that one local prospect who above all others becomes the must-get target who will help define the way USC's signing class is viewed.
 It was Justin Flowe in 2020, it's Korey Foreman in this ongoing 2021 class and for 2022, it's Mater Dei High School 5-star cornerback Domani Jackson, who is the No. 2-ranked prospect nationally in his class.
 Key to USC's hopes of keeping Jackson close to home is cornerbacks coach Donte Williams and the relationship they've been building.
 “You know, it’s home. I love Coach Donte, previously from Oregon [before he] came here. I just love the way he performs and [his] DBs always go in the draft,” Jackson told TrojanSports.com.
 Meanwhile, Jackson has been taking a look at the Trojans' new defensive scheme under coordinator Todd Orlando, which demands a lot of one-on-one coverage from the cornerbacks due to the aggressive blitzing nature of the system.
 “They looking a little rusty just cause coronavirus and stuff. I know they can lock in and be dominant towards the end," Jackson said.
 The Trojans' top challengers in Jackson's recruitment have really started to come into focus. He outlined that group overall, while emphasizing that USC definitely remains a strong consideration.

The utility giant has admitted handing out $1.3 million in no-work lobbying jobs and sub-contracts to Madigan allies in exchange for favorable legislation. Court documents in the investigation have not named Madigan but identify him by title.
 “If Speaker Madigan wants to continue in a position of enormous public trust with such a serious ethical cloud hanging over his head, then he has to, at the very least, be willing to stand in front of the press and the people and answer every last question to their satisfaction,” Pritzker said at the end of his daily briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic in Chicago.

Our valued readers write in from time to time to ask questions about the community, present concerns or take a position on an important issue.
 Lisa Hoenig Baker asks, “let’s endorse face masks for Chowan County. YOU can do it!”
 With COVID-19 cases on the rise, state officials are urging Chowan County and 35 other counties to adopt stricter restrictions to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.
 In October, Chowan County received a letter from state health and public safety officials asking it to consider new measures like fining businesses that fail to enforce the state’s mask-wearing mandate.
 The letter asks officials to consider adopting a pandemic-specific ordinance that imposes a civil penalty or fine — separate from a Class 2 misdemeanor — on those who violate its provisions. It also asks them to support their local health department director in issuing and enforcing “an Imminent Hazard Abatement Order” against anyone whose actions, “including failure to comply with the governor’s executive order,” pose an “imminent hazard to your community.”
 To put it bluntly, people should be wearing masks at the grocery store, library, certainly in criminal court, post office too – any public place – because you don’t know who may have the virus and who doesn’t.
 Apply common sense – don’t live in fear – if you’re driving alone in your car at 55 mph on Virginia Road, you probably don’t need to be wearing a mask. If you’re walking your dog on the courthouse green soon after sunrise, you don’t need to wear a mask – but please, pick up after your dog. If you’re kayaking in the bay while wearing a mask, you need to stop watching network television and stay away from Facebook.
 We’re not going to endorse mandatory face masks, but Hoenig-Baker has a valid point about the need to wear a mask.
 Since the pandemic started, Chowan County has had 560 confirmed reported cases of COVID-19, presently with 26 active cases, 519 recovered cases and 15 total deaths – 11 of those deaths at assisted living facilities – according to the latest statistics from Albemarle Regional Health Service.
 ARHS reported Friday that 3,757 people in the region infected with COVID-19 have now recovered from it. That’s 91% of total cases. While the recovery rate is quite high, the virus should be taken very seriously particularly as wearing masks helps protect those who are most vulnerable.
 We’ve all known folks in the community who have endured the virus, placed themselves in quarantine – indeed people who are most at risk because of underlying health conditions or within that age demographic who are most at risk.
 Moreover, to be quite candid, our daughter, a freshman at John A. Holmes, was in quarantine the past two weeks because she was in close proximity to a classmate who tested positive for the virus. School system is most certainly on the front lines of this pandemic.
 Soon after, the editor of this newspaper, Nicole Bowman-Layton, was in close proximity to someone who was later diagnosed as having the virus, the editor got tested at the American Legion – free testing. Test came back negative, but it was a long night of wondering about the possibilities.
 Back to Hoenig-Baker’s suggestion about endorsing a mask mandate – we feel the best approach is a community/personal commitment to safety, not one that requires the government to intervene because even the most enlightened lawmakers, despite their best intentions, are unable to legislate nor enforce what should be considered common sense. Personal responsibility is its own reward.
 We’re very, very reluctant in these trying times to endorse further government overreach particularly as politicians and their enablers, career bureaucrats, tend to have a double-standard when it comes “rules for thee, but not for me” approach to leadership. Google Nancy Pelosi and hair salon.
 Or when the government permits “peaceful” protests but thinks people should not travel nor have more than 10 people attend a family’s Thanksgiving dinner. Or how it’s OK to shop at a big box store, but you should think twice about shopping local or attending church on Sunday.
 As to those well-intentioned folks out there who are virtue signaling on Facebook about wearing masks – go away – you’re not helping. Because of the political divide, half the country does not trust the people on the opposite side. Rather than wearing a mask, some folks may decide otherwise so as to spite what the latest Facebook diva says.
 Nor do we trust the scientists who’ve been all over the map on not just about the severity of the virus, but whether wearing a mask works.
 Nor do we trust the fear mongering, corrupt mainstream media to get it right when they’ve enabled politicians to politicize a pandemic, further widening the divide, when we should instead be united in our resolve to stop the spread of COVID-19.
 We should trust the people to do what’s best rather than the government.
 So although we don’t endorse a mask mandate, we support Hoenig-Baker’s principled approach in seeking to keep Chowan County safe.

Whereas official high-profile commemoration of the Korean War focuses on Chinese military forces “protecting the homeland,” everyday citizens tend to remember the war by focusing more on its forgotten veterans and their families.

 # Anomalies found in data put census deadline in jeopardy
 By Mike Schneider
 Associated Press
 The director of the Census Bureau said Thursday that irregularities have been found during the numbers-crunching phase of the 2020 census, a development that jeopardizes the statistical agency’s ability to meet a year-end deadline for handing in numbers used for divvying up congressional seats.
 The Census Bureau already was facing a shortened schedule of two and a half months for processing the data collected during the 2020 census — about half the time originally planned. The Census Bureau would not say Thursday what the anomalies were or publicly state if there would be a new deadline for the apportionment numbers.
 “These types of processing anomalies have occurred in past censuses," Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said in a statement. “I am directing the Census Bureau to utilize all resources available to resolve this as expeditiously as possible. As it has been all along, our goal remains an accurate and statistically sound Census."
 The Census Bureau said it would not comment further.
 “This is not surprising to me at all," said Robert Santos, president-elect of the American Statistical Association, in an email. “The notion that the 2020 Census data could be processed in half the time scheduled given all the obstacles & challenges that Census Bureau encountered defies logic."
 Those challenges included a pandemic, wildfires out West and hurricanes in Gulf Coast states.
 Missing the Dec. 31 deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers would be a blow to President Donald Trump's efforts to exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the numbers used to determine how many congressional seats each state gets and how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed.
 Once the president receives the numbers by the Dec. 31 deadline, the president has about a week from the start of the next Congress to transmit them to the House. If the Census Bureau delays turning in the apportionment numbers because of the processing problems, that transfer of the numbers could take place after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
 Trump’s apportionment order has been found unlawful by three courts — in New York, California and Maryland. The Justice Department has appealed to the Supreme Court, which is hearing arguments at the end of the month.
 Because of the pandemic, the Census Bureau switched its deadline for wrapping up the once-a-decade head count of every U.S. resident from the end of July to the end of October. It also extended the deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers from the end of December to the end of next April, giving bureau statisticians five months to crunch the numbers.
 However in late July and early August, officials at the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, announced field operations would finish at the end of September and the apportionment numbers would stick to a congressionally mandated deadline of Dec. 31.
 A coalition of local governments and advocacy groups sued, claiming a shortened schedule would shortchange minorities and hard-to-count communities. Their lawsuit also said the schedule was shortened to make sure the numbers- crunching took place on the Trump administration's watch so that the president’s order on apportionment could be enforced.
 Jeffrey Wice, an adjunct professor at New York Law School who is an expert in census law and redistricting, said he would not be surprised if the president, in his last weeks in office, installs as the bureau's head a political appointee “who will do whatever Trump wants him to do."
 In the past year, the Trump administration has named a handful of political appointees to the Census Bureau's leadership team, drawing sharp criticism from Democratic leaders of a House oversight committee and questions about their hiring from the Commerce Department's inspector general.
 “That is totally unpredictable," said Wice, who has worked with the national Democratic Party on redistricting programs.

Rain will return in a much more widespread form on Sunday. It’ll spread in from west to east during the daylight hours, eventually hitting its peak coverage and intensity Sunday afternoon.
 Because of the rain and clouds, high temperatures won’t rise above 60 degrees for most. As the sun goes down the rain will come to an end, leaving behind a half inch or so of rainfall, with totals closer to one inch the farther north you travel toward Central Indiana.
 With the cold front generating Sunday’s rain out of the picture, Monday looks to be a cooler day with partly sunny skies and highs only in the 40s and lower 50s. We’ll see a gradual return to the mid 50s for the middle part of the week, but a decent chance of rain and even some gusty winds will accompany that on Wednesday.
 For now, the Thanksgiving forecast looks dry and mild with highs near 60!

The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) Foundation and the event Co-Chairs, SandraChartrand, President of the Sandra and Alain Bouchard Foundation, and Nadine Renaud-Tinker, President of RBC, Quebec Region, RBC Royal Bank, recently announced that the first This is Not a Ball online charity auction held from November 5 to 12 surpassed its target.
 Thanks to the generous contributions of invaluable donors, the Foundation's first-ever online auction raised over $215,000. The net proceeds were $115,000 as a goal of the event was to sell works by Quebec and Canadian artists and to pay the artists and gallery owners fair market prices for the works, 20 of which are now going to happy art lovers and collectors.
 More than 100 people bid on over 70 lots that included a selection of works by local artists as well as exclusive experiences at the Museum and across Quebec to encourage our ecosystem and local economy. However, art buyers just starting their collections were not left out. Members of the MMFA's Young Philanthropists' Circle (YPC) could access a select group of contemporary works whose starting bids were more accessible.
 This initiative, which complements the MMFA's traditional annual ball, aims to provide additional and vital funding to help the Museum pursue its artistic and social mission, which is essential to society, particularly in light of the current pandemic.

“You’ve got to play games with your mask on and stuff like that. You can’t even breathe half the time. It’s very hard,” said Thompson, the 6-foot-6 junior from Camden, New Jersey.
 Thompson, along with several other Red Flash players and coaches Rob Krimmel and Keila Whittington met the press as part of a virtual basketball media day on Thursday afternoon.
 While they were asked the standard questions about things such as how the men are going to fill big shoes in the backcourt or how the women are going to cut down turnovers in efforts to stay near the top of the Northeast Conference, it all was done in the context of just being able to try to do that amid a global pandemic.
 “It’s nice to be able to talk about basketball, especially where things have come,” Krimmel said. “It’s certainly been a challenging time for us all.”
 Not just in trying to breathe through multiple layers of folded cloth while running up and down 94 feet of court for two hours or practicing social distancing while doing so, either. Krimmel’s been endeavoring to build a playing rotation with four new starters without the benefit of two preseason scrimmages. In fact, Krimmel said, he’s been trying to develop several rotations as a precaution in the event his Red Flash men have to play without anyone because of a potential quarantine situation. Red Flash players are being tested for COVID-19 three times per week.
 St. Francis announced just a few hours before the press conference that, as a result of the pandemic, fans wouldn’t be permitted at its home games until at least Jan. 15, only the players and “essential gameday personnel.”
 The NEC schedule came out on Monday. It looks more like a baseball schedule, with teams playing the same opponent on back-to-back days at the same venue in an effort to guard against spreading the virus.
 “It’s going to be different,” said Krimmel, whose team opens at Pitt on Wednesday and travels to No. 4 Virginia on Dec. 1. “It’s certainly not ideal, but, to be able to play games, and to do it in a safe manner, I’m all for it.”
 The St. Francis men are coming off a loss in the Northeast Conference championship game to Robert Morris, which has since left for the Horizon League. The NEC didn’t even get to complete its conference women’s tournament, shutting things down right after the Red Flash were upset by Sacred Heart in the quarterfinals.

Arians tinkered with his usual practice routine, working at night instead of the afternoon, and intends to make changes on game day in hopes of avoiding slow starts that contributed to a Thursday night loss at Chicago and a 38-3 Sunday night debacle against New Orleans at home two weeks ago.
 Tight end Rob Gronkowski said there are no valid reasons for not performing well under the lights. He and Brady were fixtures in prime-time games while they were together with the New England Patriots.
 Brady improved to 18-7 in 25 starts on “Monday Night Football” three weeks ago, with the Bucs overcoming a slow start before holding off the Giants 25-23 when Daniel Jones’ potential game-tying 2-point conversion pass was broken up in the end zone.
 “It’s just another football game, and that’s how we’ve got to treat it. You can’t let it get to your head that it’s a prime-time game, that you’ve got to do this, you’ve got to do that,” Gronkowski said.

The Chargers are looking to bounce back after being outplayed in all three phases last week at Miami. All six of their losses have been by eight points or fewer. Despite the close margins, the frustration level continues to rise.

Trump's allies have homed in on the way that the president's early lead in Michigan and some other states on Election Night slipped away as later votes came, casting it as evidence of something nefarious.
 But a massive influx of mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic leaned largely to Biden, who encouraged his supporters to vote by mail, and those votes were the last to be counted. So it appeared Trump had an edge when he really didn't.
 In fact, Biden crushed Trump in Wayne County, a Democratic stronghold that includes Detroit, by a more than 2-1 margin on his way to winning Michigan by 146,000 votes, according to unofficial results.
 Earlier this week, the county's two Republicans canvassers blocked the certification of votes there. They later relented and the results were certified. But a person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support. Then, on Wednesday, Palmer and Hartmann signed affidavits saying they believed the county vote "should not be certified."
 They cannot rescind their votes, according to the Michigan secretary of state. The four-member state canvassing board is expected to meet Monday and also is split with two Democrats and two Republicans.
 Trump appears intent on pushing the issue. He has invited Michigan's Republican legislative leaders, Senate Majority Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, to the White House, according to two officials familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. The two have agreed to go, according to one official, but they haven't commented publicly, and it's not clear what the purpose of the meeting is.
 The Michigan Legislature would be called on to select electors if Trump succeeded in convincing the state's board of canvassers not to certify Biden's 153,000-vote victory in the state. But both legislative leaders have indicated they will not try to overturn Biden's win.
 "Michigan law does not include a provision for the Legislature to directly select electors or to award electors to anyone other than the person who received the most votes," Shirkey's spokeswoman said last week.
 During a press conference in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday, Biden said Americans are "witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions."
 He added, "I just think it's totally irresponsible."
 A few hours earlier, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others had held a press conference to allege a widespread Democratic election conspiracy involving multiple states and suspect voting machines. But election officials across the country have said repeatedly there was no widespread fraud.
 Many of the allegations of fraud stem from poll watchers who filed affidavits included with lawsuits in battleground states aimed at delaying vote certification. Those affidavits lean into innuendo and unsupported suggestions of fraud.
 For example, they refer to suitcases in a polling place, but make no suggestion that ballots were being secretly counted. There are allegations of ballots being duplicated -- something routinely done when a ballot is physically damaged. There are claims that partisan poll watchers were too far away to observe well and therefore something fishy was probably going on. But they don't have proof. Poll watchers have no auditing role in elections; they are volunteer observers.
 Giuliani cited a few sworn affidavits that he said showed a vast Democratic conspiracy, but added that he could not reveal much of the evidence. One he cited was from Jessy Jacob, identified as a city employee in Detroit who said she saw other workers coaching voters to cast ballots for Biden and the Democrats.
 A judge who refused to block certification of Detroit-area results noted that Jacob's claims included no "date, location, frequency or names of employees" and that she only came forward after unofficial results indicated Biden had won Michigan.
 Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who joined Giuliani, said more evidence would be forthcoming and that Trump's allies would have more success in courts going forward. But so far, most of their legal actions have been dismissed.
 Chris Krebs, the Trump administration election official fired last week over the comments about the security of 2020, tweeted: "That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest."
 In Pennsylvania, where the Trump campaign is challenging the election results in federal court, a legal team led by Giuliani suggested in a filing Wednesday that the judge order the Republican-led state legislature to pick delegates to the Electoral College, potentially throwing the state's 20 electoral votes to Trump. A judge canceled an evidentiary hearing in the case.
 In Arizona, the Republican Party is pressuring county officials to delay certifying results. The GOP lost a bid on Thursday to postpone certification in Maricopa County, the state's most populous. In northwestern Arizona, Mohave County officials postponed their certification until next week.
 Judge John Hannah ruled without explanation, except to bar the party from refiling the case. The judge promised a full explanation in the future.
 Maricopa County officials are expected to certify elections results on Friday.
 Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes, and Maricopa County put him over the top. The county performed a hand count of some ballots the weekend after the election, which showed its machine counts were 100% accurate. The same was found Wednesday during routine post-election accuracy tests.
 In Georgia, where officials have been auditing the results of the presidential race, Trump has repeatedly attacked the process and called it "a joke."
 He has also made repeated incorrect assertions that Georgia election officials are unable to verify signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. In fact, Georgia requires that they be checked.
 The secretary of state's office planned to release results of the audit on Thursday.
 During the hand tally, several counties found previously uncounted ballots that the secretary of state's office has said would reduce Biden's lead to just under 13,000 votes, with roughly 5 million total votes cast. Georgia law allows a candidate to request a recount within two business days of certification if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. That recount would be done using machines.

The 1945 team holds the program record with three ranked wins in one year. The midseason watch list was created through a selection process by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation and the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, taking into consideration each program's Academic Progress Rate (APR), current performance during the 2020 season and each coach's commitment to service and charity in the community.
 Considering The Dodd Trophy represents more than just a coach's performance on the field, a coach in his first year, who has not had a full season to establish his own impact on APR and the local community, is not eligible to win.
 "It's been an unprecedented season so far this year and we had to consider a variety of factors when compiling this list," said Jim Terry, chairman of the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation. "At the end of the day, we selected the coaches who we felt truly embody Bobby Dodd's three pillars of scholarship, leadership and integrity, both on and off the football field."
 Of the 19 coaches on the midseason watch list, the SEC leads the way with five coaches selected, immediately followed by the Big Ten and Big 12 with four each, the ACC with three, the Pac-12 with two and the American with one. A total of nine coaches on the list remain undefeated going into the 12th week of the season. This year's midseason watch list includes three former winners of The Dodd Trophy with Brian Kelly (2018), Nick Saban (2014) and Dabo Swinney (2011) all making the list. The coaches on the list have collectively appeared in the College Football Playoff 17 times, and have won a total of nine national championships and 27 FBS conference championships. Off the football field and in the classroom, their teams earned an average Academic Progress Rate (APR) of 977 last year.
 "The Dodd Trophy is unique from other coach of the year awards considering it looks beyond just wins and losses on the football field," said Gary Stokan, Peach Bowl, Inc. CEO & president. "Each of these coaches have had successful seasons to date, but what sets them apart is how they've empowered their players in the classroom and impacted their communities in a positive way. All of these coaches on the watch list are strong contenders for this year's Dodd Trophy and we look forward to seeing who emerges as finalists this last month of the season."
 A panel consisting of previous winners, national media, a member of the Dodd family and a College Football Hall of Fame member will identify the final list of potential recipients at the conclusion of the 2020 season. The winner of the 2020 Dodd Trophy will be announced in Atlanta during the week of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.

Conclusion of the story of the unusual wartime service of Paul Linde of Crossville.
 It is essential that the angle between the roof like facets be square within two seconds of arc, or l/1800 of a single degree. How infinitesimal such an angle is would be shown if you could see a man at 30 miles way with light rays coming from his left and right shoulders to your eye that would make such an angle. Bringing the roof angle by hand retouching to this high precision, and at the same time keeping the determining surface flat; is the chief reason why roof prisms are far more difficult to make than ordinary prisms. “The Group” members made 28,360 roof prisms, the equivalent of three and a half months of production by a professional producer.
 Some members of “The Gang” combined forces. Uvaroff, whose superb workmanship soon brought him a large order for 300 prisms, worked as a partner of MacTavish (code name for Fred Ferson) whose second order was for 1,700. Together the men worked in a temporary barn-like building. Their combined orders for several thousand roof prisms was nearly complete, and with an exceptionally high acceptance of better than 98 percent!
 Those who worked in the Roof Prism program took on 'aliases' for their protection. Thus Pavel Uvaroff, was actually Paul Linde of Crossville, his partner was not MacTavish, but actually Fred B. Ferson. It was Ferson who said, “Give all the roof prism producers fictitious names and, for fear of sabotage, omit their locations. Ferson-Linde Optical Company, of Biloxi, Mississippi, made the largest number, 11,160 of prisms for the wartime efforts. The company consisted of Ferson (MacTavish) of Biloxi and Paul Linde (Pavel Uvaroff) of Crossville, Tennessee, and one full time helper trained to do grinding. The prisms they produced had a 99 ½ percent acceptance rate, the highest among “The Gang.”
 The Daily Herald August 4, 1943, said, “Fred B. Ferson and Paul Linde, formerly of Tennessee, have given up their jobs to work full time to produce high quality prisms for the military in range finders for tanks, ships, and large artillery pieces for the Franklin Arsenal. They are assisted in their shop by J. B. McElroy, and J. I. McKinzie. Since 1941, the government has given contracts to amateur lens makers to help eliminate the paucity (scarcity) of roof prism manufacturing in America.”
 Ferson established Ferson Optics in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, originally to make telescopes. During the Korean War their government business grew and they quit making telescopes. They made quartz windows for experimental aircraft and the Mercury and Apollo space capsules; designed tracking cameras for White Sands and Aberdeen rocket testing programs. In the mid-1960's, Ferson's company was purchased by Bausch & Lomb.
 After the war, Linde returned to Crossville and continued his optical career. This is “the rest of the story” for Paul Linde (Pavel Uvaroff) of Crossville, and his invaluable and intricate wartime service.
 Sadly, his wife, Julia Jay Linde, died of cancer at the age of 65, on December 24, 1951. Paul was inconsolable. He began to drink more and more and became an alcoholic as his depression deepened. Paul Linde died at the age of 72, on August 15, 1955. His death certificate shows that he died of alcoholism, depression, and suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.
 We don’t always get the happy ending that we would wish for, but that still cannot overshadow the enormous contribution made during Paul Linde’s lifetime. Many of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen’s lives were saved by the work that he and this special “Gang” accomplished.

Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], November 20 (ANI): Accusing Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao of indirectly helping the NDA by forging a front against BJP with Congress allies, Telangana Congress MP Revanth Reddy on Thursday said that Rao dances to the tune of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   "KCR dances to the music of PM Modi and the BJP. And the whole country knows the drama of Chandrashekar Rao and people are not ready to believe in his words anymore," Reddy told reporters here.   This comes after Rao called for the formation of an anti-BJP front and said he will speak to all leaders who are against the ruling party at the Centre.   "K Chandrashekhar Rao is master in the habit of telling lies. No one can beat him in telling lies to the public. He can't help but pass such statements like Congress is facing its end days and that they are forming an anti-BJP conclave," Reddy said.   He accused the KCR and the BJP of trying to weaken the Congress party, by forging an alliance with its allies, which Reddy said will indirectly strengthen the BJP.  
 "He (KCR) said the same during the 2018 election. This happens when NDA is weakening and to help them gain strength, issues such statements. This federal front is a part of their attempt to weakening the Congress party. Only those regional and national parties who work closely with Congress are being targeted every time," Reddy said.   "So, if they are able to directly weaken Congress, that would indirectly strengthen the BJP... We have been facing such situations for a long time now and we are well aware of it. If the TRS and KCR really want to fight against BJP, then why aren't they joining hands with the Congress," he added.   Reddy said that the TRS party has shown its support to PM Modi and BJP on various occasions.   "If KCR really wants to fight against Modi, then he must call for a state assembly immediately and has to pass a resolution for rejecting the agricultural bills. And if he does so, then we would believe him one per cent. We have been seeing KCR for over 20 years now and have seen him lie over 1,000 times now," he added.   Reddy said that Rao has come up with this "federal front" to cover-up his failures as the GHMC elections are approaching. "But, he must remember that no one is ready to listen to his lies now," he added. (ANI)

Last week I mentioned a pecan-topped pumpkin pie. Now’s the time to give you that recipe. It can be an option, as can the second pumpkin pie you see here, for your Thanksgiving dessert buffet.
 I know it wouldn’t be the holiday around here unless the Libby’s pumpkin pie is baked up and ready to serve, still warm from the oven. The recipe for it has been on the Libby’s pumpkin can for decades. We also have to have our traditional meringue pecans nearby in a covered candy jar. That treat signals the beginning of our Thanksgiving season.
 A pumpkin pie is most likely demanded at your house, with your recipe maybe incorporating different spices and ingredients from the Libby’s. But you know homemade isn’t the only way to go. Don’t ignore the ladies, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Callender, in the freezer case during this time of busy cooking.
 I made a well-received, no-bake triple pumpkin pie last month from a tear-off recipe at a display of Jell-O Pumpkin Instant Pudding Mix. The recipe may still be floating around in various grocery stores but it has to be online at the Jell-O site.
 The mousse pie today is reminiscent in flavor of the standard Libby’s baked pie, since the spices are so much the same. For convenience, the pie already incorporates the whipped cream that is demanded for topping pumpkin pie. It’s lurking in both the filling and across the top. The whole dessert never touches an oven. It can be made a day ahead, which might relieve any last- minute or early Thanksgiving morning prep.

In 2020, that meant making the adjustments necessary just to stay in the game. Starting from when the pandemic shut down the world in mid-March, Champion figured out a way to keep his eyes on the prize. He worked out every day.
 “I usually don’t train that time of year, because you’re traveling to Houston then you’ve got San Antonio and all these rodeos, then you’re rolling into California for the spring rodeos on the West Coast,” he said. “I’m usually getting ready to go to Canada and start my season there. You have no chance to gain ground on fitness, so I worked out a different program, something I’d never do if I was competing.
 “I also fished a lot, so I walked six to 10 miles of river a day fishing. Whenever they announced Cave Creek (Arizona) was a go, I was ready.”
 Once the season restarted in late May, the schedule was vastly different. Missing were many of the largest rodeos, and many others were delayed. That forced the traditional routes to change.
 “It was nuts for a while and made zero sense,” said Champion, who credits much of his success to sponsors Yeti, Hooey and Tony Lama. “I was showing up at rodeos that I hadn’t been to in years. Here we are battling for $800 a day. And we were doing all this without any security that there would be an NFR and a chance to win a gold buckle.
 “We were just trusting that all this effort was going to be for something. Thanks to the PRCA and Arlington, it wasn’t for nothing.”
 It will be a nice return-to-glory moment for Champion when he arrives in north Texas in December. The American – the first-of-its-kind event that has now become part of the PRCA – was produced for the first time in 2014 at AT&T Stadium, which sits next door to Globe Life Field and is home to the Dallas Cowboys.
 At that first event, Champion made a name for himself at just 21 years of age when he became the first “qualifier” to win his event. By also being the only qualifier that season, he earned the $1 million side pot. In the six years since, the side pot has been shared by multiple contestants, so Champion still stands by himself.
 He’s also earned some prestige along the way while also moving from his longtime Texas home to western Montana. Last December, he earned $108,154 over 10 nights at the NFR and finished fourth in the world standings. He’s earned the recognition as being one of the greatest bareback riders to every compete in the sport.
 “My five previous trips to the NFR have taught me what’s important and what’s not,” Champion said. “It comes down to riding 10 bucking horses in a row, and we do that all the time. You can’t let anything get in your head. It’s about working smarter, not harder.
 “When I get there, I’ll find that routine, get settled in and get everything on a reaction level. That’s when I’m at my best.”

Champion will have an opportunity to grasp it at this year’s NFR, set for Dec. 3-12 at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. It’s his sixth trip to ProRodeo’s premier event in seven seasons, and the only year he missed was because of an injury that sidelined him much of the campaign.
 “Making the NFR is the goal every year, but it’s crazy that it’s coming up on six times,” said Champion, 28. “It feels like yesterday that I was going to my first one. That feeling of success and accomplishment never gets old.
 “There’s been talk about how the guy that wins the gold buckle this year has done it without all those big rodeos. If he came from anywhere below the top five, it will be the hardest gold buckle to win. There was no money to win. There were not big leaps to get into the top 15, much less get yourself in position to win a gold buckle.”
 Such is life in 2020, a year in the throes of a global pandemic that has added a “new normal” to the people around the world. Lives were put on hold, restaurants closed and events eliminated.
 Of the 700-plus annual professional rodeos, more than half were canceled. For cowboys who make their livings eight seconds at a time, it was a major adjustment.
 Champion finished the regular season with $64,149, good for seventh in the world standings; only the top 15 on the money list in each event at the end of the regular season advance to the NFR. In a sport where dollars equal points, each paycheck is vital. The contestants in each event who earn the most money at the conclusion of the NFR will be crowned world champions.
 “As much as I’m looking forward to the experiences that come with the NFR – the back-number ceremony, the bareback riders dinner and the other things that come with it – what I’m looking forward to most is a chance to ride for a gold buckle,” said Champion, who competed in college rodeo at Tarleton State University in Texas, just 95 miles from this year’s NFR. “That’s why I do this. I love what I do, but I crave that world title.”
 That’s what being a competitor is all about, and he knows what it means. He’s married to the former Paige Lawrence, an Olympic figure skater who was raised in Saskatchewan. Together, they make up a strong couple willing to go above and beyond to realize their dreams.

 # Driver charged with OUI after Yarmouth crash
 By Beth Treffeisen
 Cape Cod Times
 SOUTH YARMOUTH — A woman was charged with operating under the influence after a two-vehicle crash in which the other driver was injured, according to a statement from the Yarmouth Police Department.
 Officers were called to High Banks and Great Western roads at 7:27 p.m. Wednesday for a report of a crash, the statement says. The caller said his vehicle was struck by another car that failed to stop at a stop sign.
 Officers found two vehicles with heavy damage, the statement says. A Subaru sedan was in the road with front-end damage and a Dodge pickup truck with damage to its side was on a lawn.
 Officers determined that the Subaru failed to stop and struck the pickup, the statement says.
 The driver of the Subaru was identified as Christine Maltias, 56, of South Yarmouth, according to the statement. Based on witness and driver statements she was charged with operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, negligent operation of a motor vehicle and failure to stop at a stop sign.
 Maltias was taken to the hospital for evaluation of possible minor injuries, according to a Police Department official.

In the recent days and weeks, Nate Hinton and trainer Jody Patton scanned countless mock drafts in an effort to learn what the Gastonia native can expect ahead of Wednesday's NBA Draft.
   
 "We've looked at them and we saw one with (Hinton) being picked in the late first round, and then we've seen others where he may not be drafted at all. One thing I do know, is that wherever he goes someone better be prepared because Nate is coming for their job."
   
 Hinton didn't hear his name called Wednesday, but the Gaston Day product might as well have unearthed a golden ticket.
   
 Shortly after the conclusion of the NBA Draft, the local native agreed to a two-way deal with the Dallas Mavericks. Hinton confirmed the news via Instagaram Live.
   
 "Do you know the tears I just cried, the tears I have been cried? We're in Dallas with it, man!" Hinton said.
   
 An all-NCISAA Class 2A performer under Gaston Day basketball coach Trent McCallister, Hinton entered Houston as a 4-star prospect ranked No. 95 in the ESPN 100.
   
 In his freshman season with the Cougars, he saw time in each of the team's 37 games. He averaged 7.2 points and 4.4 rebounds per game, helping them to a Sweet 16 appearance in the 2019 NCAA Tournament. For his work, Hinton was named to the American Athletic Conference's all-freshman team.
   
 The former local standout continued his upward progression as a sophomore, averaging 10.6 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. During a Dec. 11, 2019 matchup with the University of Texas-Arlington, he scored what would be his college career-high with 25 points on 9-of-15 shooting, knocking down four 3-pointers in the contest.
   
 Patton said whether it be through Hinton being drafted or as an undrafted free agent, the work necessary to be the best remains the same. Apparently, the local product tends to agree.
   
 "It ain't no high major, it ain't no mid-major, it ain't no 'Power 5', 'Power 6', aint no All-American, aint no McDonald's All-American," Hinton said on Instagram. "That thing says NBA, that thing is one thing and one thing only. And guess what? The playing field is level, so you know what that means."

So I think for this particular drop down, we don't feel the timing is right to increase the distribution.

Shirley Ann Carper   1937-2020   Shirley Ann Story was born August 17, 1937 in Galesburg, IL to Ray and Dorothy Story.   On August 30, 2020 in San Francisco, Ca our dearly loved mother went to be with our Lord and Savior.      Surviving are 3 daughters and a son, Kathryn Carper, Susan Grimes (Robert), Karen Arce-Carper, Steven Carper (Susan), and 5 Grandchildren, Kendra, Brent, Garrett, Grae, and Savanna.   Shirley was preceded in death by her beloved son, Gregory.   She was preceded in death by the father of her 5 children, John Carper      Shirley began her esthiology career apprenticing with the well-known Ron Bygum, Fabulous Faces. Her knowledge and expertise along with her special connection with her clientele propelled Shirley to create a business of her own, Faces Etcetera. Kathryn joined her in business in 1989. Both Karen and Susan contributed their special talents, as well. Faces Etcetera gained a reputation as a renowned SF full-service skin care salon. Shirley was highly valued and respected by her loyal clientele.      Faces Etcetera was most definitely a family affair. She brought all kids and Grandkids into the business. We have such fond memories of those times.      When Shirley retired in 2002, she continued to be in great demand with her clients. She and Gregory went on to create an online skin care product and counseling business which continued until weeks before her passing.      She was a true San Franciscan and always amused at the fact she shared her birth year, 1937, with the Golden Gate Bridge. We had a huge 50th birthday celebration (as did the GG Bridge).      Shirley was a hero to many and in 2007 received the Certificate of Honor from City and County of SF for the landmark victory of her case for housing discrimination. Shirley felt her case sent a strong reminder to landlords to provide reasonable accommodation to tenets with disabilities.      Shirley possessed a strong spiritual connection with Jesus Christ that grew as the years passed. She is an inspiration to her children, grandchildren and supported us in our spiritual growth. She was known for her deep love and commitment to her children and family.      Isaiah 41:10 Fear not, for I am with you;   Be not dismayed, for I am your God.   I will strengthen you,   Yes, I will help you,   I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.      A celebration of her life will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to honor Shirley's memory may donate to; St. Anthony's Foundation; 150 Golden Gate Avenue; San Francisco; Ca; 94102

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Men who allege decades-old sexual abuse by an Ohio State team doctor and are upset about how the university has handled their unsettled claims pushed for a stronger response Thursday, with several asking trustees how they'd feel if their own children had experienced such mistreatment.
 Between live statements to the trustees' virtual meeting and a video shared separately, about a dozen men recounted how they were hurt by the late Richard Strauss and by the university's response since an ex-wrestler's allegations led to a stunning investigation for the school in 2018.
 A former hockey player said through tears that he'd been raped by Strauss and never finished his degree. Other alumni talked about feeling retraumatized, anxious or depressed over the past three years as they've fought for changes at the university and for greater compensation and acknowledgment they feel they're owed.
 Former wrestler Mike Schyck pointed out it was his third time pleading with the board.
 “I just hope you guys do the right thing, and do what’s fair, and do it quickly,” he said. “I don’t want to be here for a fourth time.”
 Reiterating the university's previous apologies, new Ohio State President Kristina Johnson called Strauss' behavior reprehensible and said it was unacceptable that school officials failed to stop him during his tenure, when students had raised concerns.
