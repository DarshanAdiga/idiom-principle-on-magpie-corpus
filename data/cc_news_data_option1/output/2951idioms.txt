The recent extension of the Collective Bargaining Agreement until 2026 is positive news. While most of the focus has been on the NHL’s Return to Play plan, the agreement also includes potential Olympic participation in 2022 (Beijing) and 2026 (Milan/Cortina). I say potential because let's be honest, there is still plenty of time between now and then for Gary Bettman and the boys to drop the ball.

The lack of panels for Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and DC Films — events which have become virtually synonymous with Comic-Con — certainly didn't help boost overall interest in Comic-Con@Home. But there were also several strange missed opportunities to generate the kind of promotional buzz that built Comic-Con into an essential pop-culture event. The only major Marvel panel at Comic- Con@Home, for the Disney Plus docuseries "Marvel's 616" on the history of the company, included two clips from the show — that had already been released to YouTube the day before. Similarly, the new release date for "Bill & Ted Face the Music" — which will now open on premium video on demand and in select theaters on Sept. 1 — was announced two days before its splashy panel on Saturday.

In April 1975, as Saigon was about to fall to the North Vietnamese, FFC was part of a massive American-led effort to remove more than 2,000 Vietnamese orphans, a mission known as Operation Babylift. The first plane to leave Saigon crashed shortly after takeoff, killing 138 on board, including some 80 children. The operation became a glaring symbol of some of the thorny issues around international adoptions. “What is the line between imperialism and charity, between babylift and kidnapping?” asked the Star. One child from a non-FFC organization, Thanh Campbell, later discovered he still had parents in Vietnam who had left him in the orphanage because they believed he would be safe there. In its haste, a private adoption agency had separated a child from his parents.

NASA on Monday gave its latest Mars rover Perseverance the all clear to launch later this week on a mission to seek out signs of ancient microbial life.
 "The launch readiness review is complete, and we are indeed go for launch," administrator Jim Bridenstine said.
 "We are in extraordinary times right now with the coronavirus pandemic, and yet we have in fact persevered and we have protected this mission because it is so important."
 The launch will take place at 7:50 am (1150 GMT) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on board a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.
 Live coverage will take place on YouTube and across social media platforms.
 Following a seven-month journey, Perseverance is set to land at Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021.
 The six-wheeled robot, which is about the size of an SUV and weighs 2,300 pounds (1,040 kilograms), is NASA's fifth Mars rover and its most advanced to date.
 It comes equipped with a small helicopter called Ingenuity that will attempt to fly -- a first on another planet -- as well as a robotic arm, and an array of cameras and a pair of microphones.
 To look for evidence of ancient fossilized bacteria, it will use two lasers and an X-ray capable of chemical analysis.
 It will also gather rock and soil samples for a future mission that will bring them back to Earth for further study.
 This is crucial for establishing whether any organic compounds it obtained really came as a result of living processes.
 Perseverance will build on previous orbital and landed missions, which established that the dry, cold Mars we see today was much warmer and wetter billions of years ago.
 These environments lasted long enough to possibly support the development of microbial life.
 With Thursday's launch, the United States will become the third nation to embark on a mission to the Red Planet this month.
 China launched a rover to Mars last week named Tianwen-1 ("Questions to Heaven").
 If China's mission succeeds, it will become only the second nation after the United States to have a rover on another planet -- though it has previously placed two rovers on the Moon.
 The United Arab Emirates also launched an orbital probe from Japan earlier this month called "Al-Amal" (Hope), the Arab world's first mission to Mars.
