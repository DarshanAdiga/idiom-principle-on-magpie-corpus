 Gulyas was arrested by investigators from the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Lower Shore, after receiving a request from the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office to investigate the incident, according to a recent release from State Police.
 As of Tuesday afternoon, the now-suspended deputy had been taken before a court commissioner and released on $10,000 unsecured bond.
 The Worcester County Sheriff’s Office opened an internal investigation that ran concurrently with the criminal investigation initiated by the Maryland State Police, according to a recent press release from the office.
 “I take this charge very seriously and I applaud the diligence and care taken by the Maryland State Police," said Sheriff Matthew Crisafulli in a statement released Tuesday. "It’s important that everyone knows that the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office values transparency and sharing critical information with the public. While I cannot comment further, as it could jeopardize the investigation, I fully believe that the community deserves to know when a member of this agency has been charged with a crime.”
