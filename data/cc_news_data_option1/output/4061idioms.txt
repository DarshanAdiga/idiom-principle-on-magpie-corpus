Jeffrey Epstein’s little black book is one of the most cursed documents ever compiled in this miserable, dying country. Totaling 97 pages and containing the names, numbers, and addresses of a considerable cross section of the global elite, Epstein’s personal contact book first turned up in a courtroom in 2009 after his former butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, tried to sell it to lawyers representing Epstein’s victims for $50,000. Rodriguez described the book, apparently assembled by Epstein’s employees, as the “Holy Grail.” It is annotated with cryptic marginalia—stars next to certain entries, arrows pointing toward others–and the names of at least 38 people are circled for reasons that aren’t totally clear. There are 1,571 names in all, with roughly 5,000 phone numbers and thousands of emails and home addresses. There are celebrities, princes and princesses, high-profile scientists, artists from all over the world, all alongside some of the world's most powerful oligarchs and political leaders—people like Prince Andrew (circled), Ehud Barak (circled), Donald Trump (circled).

The Center Square) – Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear condemned an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and called domestic groups claiming to be freedom fighters terrorists.
 On Thursday, federal authorities announced 13 people were charged in what they called a domestic terrorism plot to kidnap Whitmer, a Democrat. According the federal complaint, the suspects planned to overthrow state governments they believed “are violating the US Constitution.”
 Also, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced seven people associated with the militia group “Wolverine Watchmen” were charged by the state.
 Beshear, also a Democrat, said these types of threats and actions have become more common.
 “This is not an isolated incident. Here in Kentucky, I was hung in effigy just yards from where we are standing on your Capitol grounds,” Beshear said. “Another man who made threats against me and Kentucky State Police was arrested at his home, where he was making grenades. These groups are not freedom fighters, they are terrorists.”
 He also called on national leaders, as well as Kentuckians, to denounce similar groups.
 “They are not security forces, they are threats to our nation. So this nation and every single one of its leaders – including everyone here in Kentucky – must in one voice denounce all of these groups,” Beshear said. “Domestic terrorism is about violence and intimidation, pure and simple. There are no two sides to it. There should be no state leaders or lawmakers pandering to these violent extremists. No posing for photos, no speaking at their rallies, because wrong is wrong.”
 According to the Associated Press, armed protesters in May chanted outside the Kentucky governor’s mansion, and Beshear was hanged in effigy from a tree on the Capitol grounds. The AP reported the rally was billed as a defense of constitutional rights but became a protest against his coronavirus restrictions.
 “I will say it again: I will not be intimidated. I will not back down, and I will continue to do the right thing,” Beshear said Thursday. “We cannot allow domestic terrorism, which threatens our way of life, to be cast in terms of patriotism or applauded on any level. It is our job as the people that make up this nation to do the right thing and send the right message.”

The Center Square) – While most eyes in the nation are turned toward who wins the presidential race on Nov. 3, battles for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are also raging are also drawing attention to Michigan.
 One such race pits first-term incumbent Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, against Republican and Detroit resident David Dudenhoefer for Michigan’s District 13 seat in the U.S. House.
 Tlaib gained national recognition as one of the two first Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018. The second congresswoman is Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat also seeking reelection in November.
 Tlaib and Omar are grouped together with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., as four newly elected representatives in 2018 dubbed “The Squad.” The four women of the Squad gained national recognition for their relative youth, outspokenness on progressive policies, and respective ethnic backgrounds.
 Before serving as district chair for the 13th District Republican Committee, Dudenhoefer participated in local political activism in the Detroit area, which historically has tilted predominately Democrat and was a congressional seat held by Rep. John Conyers from 1965 to 2017.
 Although neither campaign responded to an emailed questionnaire from The Center Square, public statements and campaign materials for Dudenhoefer and Tlaib reveal vast differences in policies advocated by the candidates.
 Dudenhoefer promotes zero-base budgeting over the current congressional use of base-line budgeting. By zero-base, the Republican wishes to implement a system by which Congress rewrites the U.S. budget each year rather than a base-line budget, which adds or subtracts taxpayer dollars to line items from the previous year’s budget.
 Whereas Dudenhoefer has indicated he favors tax cuts across the board as well as cutting government spending, Tlaib told the Detroit News her position is to raise taxes on the wealthy, “the richest of the rich,” in an attempt to ensure everyone pays a fair share as well as eliminating corporate tax loopholes.
 She said the two biggest issues she wishes to tackle are “corporate greed and bigotry.”
 Tlaib supports universal health care, but Dudenhoefer proposes a less- government oriented approach. For example, he told the Detroit News reducing government influence on private insurance would result in reduced costs and increased competition.
 If elected, Dudenhoefer has said he’d like to serve on the following House of Representative committees: Financial Services; Foreign Affairs; Infrastructure; Veteran Affairs.
 Tlaib, an incumbent, currently serves as the Vice Chair for the House Oversight Subcommittee on Environment. She has expressed interest in serving as the House Appropriations Committee chairperson.

One of the most egregious vulnerabilities that the group found would have allowed hackers to build a worm that steals people's iCloud files before infecting the iCloud accounts of their contacts. The vulnerability hinges on the fact that Apple Mail is supported by iCloud -- the white hat hackers were able to compromise iCloud accounts after sending an email to an iCloud.com email address that contained malicious code.
 Apple patched all of the vulnerabilities shortly after they were reported, Curry said.
 In the process of seeking out the bugs, Curry and his team gained insight in the massive scale of Apple's online infrastructure. Apple owns more than 25,000 web servers, which fall under Apple.com, iCloud.com, and over 7,000 other unique domains, the researchers found. Many of the vulnerabilities were discovered by searching through obscure web servers owned by Apple, like its Distinguished Educators site.
 Cybersecurity experts who reviewed the research by Curry's team said that, while some of the severe vulnerabilities are concerning, they reflect inherent challenges that should be expected for a company maintaining such huge online infrastructure.

A friend of Maxwell who had also seen the book told me, “This looks like her address book….I know several people [in here] who’ve never met him.” I would figure about a fourth of the people listed in the black book knew only Maxwell.

El 'freestyler' KDT RSD tratará de convertirse en el primer bicampeón dominicano de Red Bull en la Final Nacional de este sábado.
 Uno de los mayores exponentes de la improvisación dominicana, Pablo Azarias Agramonte, más conocido como KDT RSD, buscará su segundo título de campeón nacional ante 15 de los mejores gallos de toda República Dominicana en la décima edición de Red Bull en el país caribeño.
 KDT consiguió el título en la edición de 2018 y rozó la hazaña de convertirse en el primer bicampeón de su país el año siguiente, cuando llegó a una final en la que Shield Master terminó arrebatándole el campeonato.
 En su primera participación en Red Bull, el competidor de Santo Domingo derrotó a grandes exponentes del 'freestyle' dominicano como Yenky One o Melvin La Cura y se convirtió en una de las irrupciones más potentes del panorama.
 No pudo alargar su buena racha en la edición internacional de ese mismo año, pues cayó en octavos de final ante uno de los mejores improvisadores del mundo, el colombiano Valles-T, pero evidenció el crecimiento de la improvisación dominicano.
 El capitaleño es uno de los 'gallos' más aclamados de su nación por su reconocida fluidez y su naturalidad. Con tan solo 21 años se ha convertido en un referente de la escena, a pesar de que asegura 'ir más relajado que otros años'. 'Sin crear expectativas -dice- más allá de dar lo mejor de mí y llegar hasta donde mi capacidad me lleve', declaró a la organización.
 Después de acariciar la gesta, KDT regresará por tercer año consecutivo a Red Bull con el cartel de favorito bajo el brazo y con la intención de acompañar a su compatriota Shield Master a la próxima Final Internacional, para la que ya están clasificados Bnet, Valles-T, Minos, Acertijo, SNK y Rapder.
 Así, República Dominicana contará con dos representantes en la Final Internacional a causa de los problemas con el visado que privaron a Shield Master de viajar a Madrid en 2019, tal y como sucedió dos años antes con Yenky One y Melvin La Cura.
 Entre los candidatos que aspiran a rebatir el campeonato destaca el nombre de Raper RSD, tercer clasificado de la pasada edición. El competidor del barrio capitaleño de Los Mina atesora experiencia internacional y se postula como la principal alternativa a KDT.
 En una lista plagada de debutantes, destacan también participantes reconocidos de la escena caribeña como Éxodo Lirical, Dery G, Metricoh Flowster, Leamback o Papurry.
 A las sonadas ausencias de Yenky One o Melvin La Cura, se suma la baja de Gaudy Mercy, la representante femenina con más finales nacionales a sus espaldas de la historia, con cinco participaciones.
 El mexicano Aczino, la rapera MelyMel y OVNI decidirán desde el jurado quién es el mejor gallo dominicano de 2020 en un espectáculo que estará dirigido por Serko Fu y ambientado por las instrumentales del DJ Freaky Philip.
 Como es habitual por la excepcionalidad de la situación y las medidas sanitarias, la organización de Red Bull realizará el evento a puerta cerrada, sin acceso a público y emitirá el evento en directo a través de Red Bull TV y sus plataformas digitales. EFE

With less than a month to go until the election, cannabis executives, investors, and activists are focused on five key states.
 On November 3, New Jersey, Arizona, South Dakota, and Montana are set to vote on legalizing cannabis for all adults over the age of 21. South Dakota also has a medical-cannabis measure on the ballot, and Mississippi is voting on a medical marijuana program.
 To the cannabis industry, New Jersey presents by far the biggest opportunity. Companies are racing to take advantage of the New Jersey market, which has potentially millions of consumers within the state as well as easy access to New York City and Philadelphia.
 Since Colorado and Washington broke ground in 2012 as the first US states to legalize recreational cannabis, nine states and Washington, DC have joined them. Medical marijuana is legal in 33 states -- meaning that a majority of Americans now have some form of access to legal marijuana.
 Ballot initiatives like the ones voters are considering on November 3 have played a major role in the spread of legal cannabis. Nine of the states that legalized recreational marijuana did so through referendums.
 Though Canada legalized cannabis federally in 2018, the US has not followed suit, forcing states to chart their own courses. As it stands, marijuana is still considered an illegal Schedule I drug by the US federal government.
 If President Donald Trump wins a second term in November, that status quo is likely to persist. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins and Democrats take the Senate, cannabis decriminalization or legalization would have a better chance.
 To put together this ballot tracker, Business Insider tapped a variety of sources to explain the nuances of each state's ballot measures and where polling stands. We rely on analysts from investment bank Cowen led by Vivien Azer, who generated probabilities for how likely each ballot measure is to pass.

A group of hackers spent months targeting Apple's sprawling online infrastructure and found a slew of vulnerabilities -- including one that would allow hackers to steal files from people's iCloud accounts -- they announced in a blog post this week.
 They were operating as "white hat" hackers, meaning their goal was to alert Apple to the vulnerabilities rather than to steal information. The team was led by 20-year-old Sam Curry, along with Brett Buerhaus, Ben Sadeghipour, Samuel Erb, and Tanner Barnes.
 "I had never worked on the Apple bug bounty program so I didn't really have any idea what to expect but decided why not try my luck and see what I could find," Curry said in the blog post. "Even though there was no guarantee regarding payouts nor an understanding of how the program worked, everyone said yes, and we began hacking on Apple."
 Apple has paid the group $288,500 so far through its bug bounty program in exchange for disclosing 55 vulnerabilities, 11 of which were labeled as "severe." Curry said that once Apple processes and rewards all of the bugs the group reported, their total payment may exceed $500,000.

Epstein’s little black book isn’t little at all—it’s gargantuan. Its defining feature is its size and thoroughness, and there are just as many boring numbers as exciting ones–for every Jordanian princess there are three reflexologists from Boca. The listings are at times preposterously detailed, often containing additional names and numbers for people’s emergency contacts, their parents, their siblings, their friends, even their children, all alongside hundreds of car phones, yacht phones, guest houses, and private office lines. Some individuals have dozens of numbers and addresses listed, while others list just a single number and first name. Epstein collected people, and if you ever had any interaction with him or Ghislaine Maxwell, his onetime girlfriend and alleged accomplice, you more than likely ended up in this book, and then several years later you received a call from me.
