The California chapter of the NAACP has not filed a state tax return since 2015, according to the Franchise Tax Board. The agency said the group has been suspended since 2018 as a result, noting an outstanding tax liability of $50.
 But it was Huffman’s political activity that has drawn the most fierce criticism. Taisha Brown, the chair of the California Democratic Party black caucus, said Huffman’s alliances this year were a tipping point for people who have raised questions about conflicts for years.
 “Everything that could potentially help Black people as residents in the state, the state NAACP went against it,” Brown said. “People have talked about this for years. I won’t let anyone get away with building wealth on the back of poor and disadvantaged people.”
 Huffman said she will be replaced by Rick Callender, the state NAACP vice president and CEO of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. She will continue to lead AC Public Affairs and remain on the national NAACP board.

AC Public Affairs took in $740,000 from the campaign opposed to Proposition 15, which was funded by business groups. The measure, which was rejected by voters, would have raised business property taxes to increase funding for schools and local services. Landlord groups and other opponents of Proposition 21 paid Huffman’s company $620,000 this year to help fight a rent control measure, which also fell short.
 The bail bond industry’s campaign against Proposition 25 paid Huffman’s company $200,000 to oppose a plan to abolish California’s cash bail system. The measure failed. Huffman also sided with ride-sharing companies that backed Proposition 22, which was approved by voters and will allow the companies’ drivers to remain independent contractors, receiving $95,000 for consulting services. Her opposition to Proposition 23, an effort to impose new rules on kidney dialysis companies that was rejected by voters, netted her company $85,000.
 Huffman said that she only works with campaigns that the state’s NAACP has endorsed and that her critics are often Democrats who feel she has stepped out of line. She’s said the state NAACP requires a majority vote of its board to take a position on any ballot measure. Huffman said her departure has nothing to do with the criticism and that she had previously made up her mind to resign, but was trying to get through the election cycle.
 But critics said the state NAACP’s process lacks transparency.
 Darrell Goode, president of the NAACP’s Santa Monica-Venice Branch, said he’s been unable to obtain meeting minutes indicating how the state’s executive board has voted on ballot measures. Goode said he sent a letter last month to the national NAACP requesting an investigation into Huffman and other members of the state NAACP board, alleging a “lack of transparency and an apparent conflict of interest.”

This week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first at-home, do- it-yourself COVID-19 test, which returns results in 30 minutes.
 That raises a pressing question for those who’ve struggled with a pandemic that has robbed us of human connection: If you tested yourself for the coronavirus and got a negative result, could you safely visit friends and family?
 It’s a tantalizing idea, especially with the holidays fast approaching. But the test isn’t authorized to be used in that way. And local public health experts caution that, while at-home COVID-19 tests will be useful, they’re no substitute for social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings.
 “It’s a good additional option,” said UC San Diego public health expert Robert “Chip” Schooley. “It’s not a ‘get out of jail free’ card.”

Kiene, an expert in global public health, says at-home testing helped make HIV testing accessible to those who weren’t comfortable or able to go to a testing site, and it could do the same for COVID-19.
 But she sees one main issue: cost. Lucira Health’s test will cost around $50, according to the company. That could be too pricey for lower-income and minority communities that have been hit hard by the pandemic if insurance won’t foot the bill.
 “Is this really going to get to the people who most need it and could most benefit from it?” Kiene said. “That $50 price tag is a big price tag.”
 The bottom line, according to Schooley and Kiene, is that at-home testing will inevitably become another tool to track the spread of the pandemic. And with San Diego’s COVID-19 case rate climbing, that’s a good thing.

"Consistency is the truest measure of performance," McVay said.

I think they are getting more and more comfortable with the intent of what we're trying to get done. They're getting more comfortable playing with one another, working off one another, understanding team defense is about rushing, coverage, all 11 being on the same page."

CDC’s Dr. Erin Sauber-Schatz, citing the million-plus new cases the U.S. is seeing a week, said it remained profoundly risky to spend significant time indoors with even a handful of visiting family members. “The safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving this year is at home with the people in your household,” she said. The federal government’s two most prominent pandemic fighters — Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. Deborah L. Birx — not only agree, NBC News reported that they had chosen to shun Atlas because nothing was to be gained by working with a nonexpert with no relevant background who challenges public health orthodoxy at every turn.
 For one example of the danger posed by Atlas to Americans, Trump has for months emphasized the Atlas theme that the declining rate of COVID-19 deaths shows how good the administration’s pandemic response has been. Instead, the rate of deaths has gone down as doctors and researchers have figured out ways to slow COVID-19’s progression and keep patients off ventilators.
 But the disease’s health consequences remain devastating. The Mayo Clinic warns that a significant number of people who had a brush with COVID-19 suffer symptoms for months after that lead to long-term health problems with the lung, heart and brain — a point Trump and Atlas never acknowledge. Think of them and their families.
 No matter how eager we all are for traditional holiday experiences built around our extended families, please think twice. If you must gather, heed the CDC and have celebrations outdoors and practice social distancing. Don’t heed the radiologist who may know a lot about CT scans and MRIs but whose prominence in the pandemic response is solely because he reinforces Donald Trump’s denial of the seriousness of the worst U.S. public health crisis in more than a century. Let’s all be thankful for promising vaccines, hope for their quick and safe arrival, and pray that Jan. 20 arrives and a sense of urgency is restored at the White House without tens of thousands more Americans dead. The need to approach the coming holidays with a sense of shared sacrifice is clear. We and our nation must rise to the occasion.
