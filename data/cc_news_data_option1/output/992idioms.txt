Work is set to begin on a new Witcher game once _Cyberpunk 2077_ launches, CD Projekt president Adam Kiciński has revealed.
 Kiciński told a group of journalists (via _Eurogamer Poland_/ _PSU_) that a "relatively clear concept" has already been staked down for the next entry in the Witcher series, but that full production would kick off "immediately" after Cyberpunk 2077 hits the shelves.
  _Cyberpunk 2077 was recently delayed until September_, so it sounds like we can expect the next Witcher game to enter development around the same time.
 Apparently, the new Witcher game won't be a direct sequel to 2015's _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_, and won't be called The Witcher 4. Kiciński also said every game the Polish studio currently has planned will be based in either the Witcher or Cyberpunk universe. A smaller team from within the studio is being resourced for development on the new Witcher game, while continued development on Cyberpunk 2077 will be handled by two larger teams.
 No further details were provided on the next Witcher game, except that it will be "embedded" into The Witcher franchise. One thing we can safely presume given the timeframe is that it'll launch on next-gen consoles, including the _PS5_ and _Xbox Series X_.
 The Witcher 3 is one of the most widely-celebrated RPGs of the current console generation, having just recently been ported to the Switch and _updated_ with PC cross-save and improved visuals.
  _We're likely years away from playing the next Witcher game, but we can look forward to playing these_ _ _upcoming games of 2020__ _much sooner._

La expansión del nuevo coronavirus, causante de una neumonía que puede ocasionar la muerte de las personas, ha desatado la preocupación en todo el mundo. De hecho, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró que la infección causada por el Covid-19 ya puede definirse como una pandemia. El coronavirus no se detiene y sigue llegando a nuevos lugares en el planeta. Por ello, los países con estos casos vienen activando protocolos para evitar que el mortal virus ingrese o se expanda en sus naciones. Ante la declaración de pandemia global, la OMS animó a todos los gobiernos a tomar las medidas apropiadas para prepararse a ello. El Covid-19 se originó en Wuhan, China, y continúa causando muertes a nivel global. Este brote viral se ha expandido con una velocidad alarmante dejando millones de casos de contagio en varios continentes. Hasta el momento, se han registrado más de 87.137 casos globales, con infecciones en todos los continentes, excepto en la Antártida. El miércoles 11 de marzo, la OMS, a través de su director Tedros Adhanom, calificó al brote del nuevo coronavirus como una pandemia. “Hemos evaluado que el covid-19 puede caracterizarse como una pandemia“, dijo Adhanom en un encuentro con medios de comunicación. La Organización Mundial de la Salud señaló que el coronavirus causante del COVID-19 ya puede definirse como pandemia después de que el número de casos afectados fuera de China se haya multiplicado por 13 en dos semanas y en ese periodo los países afectados se hayan triplicado. Al día de hoy ya hay más de 110.000 casos confirmados en al menos 120 países, unas 4.000 muertes y más de 60 mil recuperados, la mayoría de ellas todavía en China continental. Asimismo, amenaza a los sistemas de salud menos desarrollados. “Podemos esperar que el número de casos, de decesos y de países afectados aumente” en los próximos días y semanas, dijo Tedros Adhanom. “Estamos profundamente preocupados tanto por los niveles alarmantes de propagación y gravedad, como por los niveles alarmantes de inacción”, subrayó. “Nunca antes habíamos visto una pandemia causada por un coronavirus. Esta es la primera pandemia de este tipo. Y nunca antes hemos visto una pandemia que pueda controlarse, al mismo tiempo“, agregó. “Pandemia no es una palabra para usar a la ligera o descuidadamente. Es una palabra que, si se usa incorrectamente, puede causar un miedo irrazonable o una aceptación injustificada de que la lucha ha terminado, lo que lleva a sufrimiento y muerte innecesarios“, advirtió el director de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Cuando se declara una infección como pandemia, se está reconociendo la circulación amplia y sostenida del agente infeccioso en varias zonas. En este caso, el Covid-19 se ha confirmado en más de 100 países en todo el mundo. Pero, aunque se reconoce la expansión del virus, no dice nada acerca de la gravedad de la enfermedad. Este reconocimiento tiene que ver más con la percepción social que con las consecuencias en la salud. Las estimaciones actuales de mortalidad lo sitúan en un rango parecido al de otras infecciones respiratorias serias causadas por virus. Por otro lado, la situación de países con menor desarrollo económico o con sistemas sanitarios poco eficaces, son los que preocupan a las autoridades; este problema puede llegar retrasar el diagnóstico precoz y el tratamiento temprano. Muchos de estos países se concentran geográficamente en el continente africano, lo que haría difícilmente controlable la situación en el caso de que el virus llegase a circular por dichas zonas. La pandemia es una epidemia que ocurre “en todo el mundo más o menos al mismo tiempo”, señaló a la BBC Rosalind Eggo, académica especialista en enfermedades infecciosas en la Escuela de Higiene y Medicina Tropical de Londres. De acuerdo a la OMS, se denomina pandemia a “la propagación mundial de una nueva enfermedad”. Esta se da cuando un virus se extiende por varios países o continentes y afecta a un gran número de personas. ¿ESTAMOS PREPARADOS? Rosalind Eggo señaló que debido a la gran movilidad y al número de viajes que realizan en todo el planeta la infección puede seguir viajando por todo el mundo y sobrevivir en los lugares a los que llega. Asimismo, Eggo destaca el papel vital que las vacunas realizan a la hora de hacer frente a enfermedades. “Las vacunas permiten que nuestros cuerpos vean cómo es un virus o una bacteria, antes de conocerlo de verdad. Si nos encontramos con ese virus o esa bacteria, nuestros cuerpos pueden responder de manera rápida y sólida”, asegura. Entonces, ¿sabríamos reaccionar ante una nueva pandemia? “El mundo está más preparado que nunca. Y los científicos, los países, las agencias de salud pública como la OMS, trabajan en estrecha colaboración para garantizar que estemos lo más preparados posible si hay una nueva pandemia”, concluye Eggo en su conversación con la BBC.

CARLETON - That first basket changes everything.
 Flat Rock's Amy Jackson immediately served notice to Dearborn Height Annapolis Tuesday night that she was a shooter to fear.
 Jackson, one of the Monroe County Region's top three-point shooters, knew she was in for a good night after stepping back and effortlessly draining her first shot of the night from behind the arc.
 "That first shot is very important because I get in my head very easily," Jackson said. "If I miss it, I start thinking about it too much."
 Jackson certainly gained momentum after the basket.
 She led Flat Rock with 16 points as the Rams rolled past Annapolis 65-40 in the Division 2 Regional semifinals at Airport High School.
 Jackson scored 14 of her points in the first half and was 5-of-6 shooting from the field before halftime. She also drilled a pair of free throws.
 "It's important to hit it early for me," she added. "It gave me confidence to pump fake because now the other team knows I can shoot. So, I can pump fake and open the door for other things for me to do offensively."
 Her leadership and offensive alongside teammate Kayla Giroux was critical to keep the Rams afloat after a slow start.
 Annapolis led 10-4 before Jackson hit her first basket. The Rams used Jackson's trey as part of a 9-0 run to take the lead.
 "It's a wake-up call for us when we get down like that," Jackson said. "It pushes us more."
 Giroux scored 14 points and was a monster on the boards with 16 rebounds. She put up 11 points in the first quarter to help Flat Rock slip into the second period with a 17-12 lead.
 Jackson took over the bulk of the offensive duties from there to lead the Rams into halftime with a 38-17 advantage.
 Flat Rock coach Marc Villemure said his team was just caught off guard by Annapolis' wild and speedy style of offense.
 "They just slash and get to the rim," he said. "I was a little disappointed we didn't keep them in front of us there for a stretch. But we were a little nervous, I'm guess. It's the first time we've been here"
 None of Rams' players were in high school the last time Flat Rock went to the Regional tournament in 2015-16.
 "They (Annapolis) are very athletic," Villemure said. "They had a couple kids who could really fly around. ... But we settled down nicely and once we got our transition going, we got to our spots on the floor and got some easy buckets."
 With a large lead at halftime, Flat Rock was able to turn to its bench to gain some experience ahead of a tough game against three-time defending state champion Detroit Edison (23-0).
 The Rams (21-3) will meet the defending champs in the Regional final at 7 p.m. Thursday. Edison defeated Dearborn Divine Child 67-42 in Tuesday's earlier semifinal.
 "We're really going to have to give some thought on how we want to attack that," Villemure said. "It's going to be a monumental task, for sure."
 Villemure said his team also has to deal with the pressure of playing a team with Edison's resume. The Pioneers are nationally ranked and have only lost twice in the last three years.
 "It's hard not to (get psyched out)," he said. "All the accolades they have and how good they are. You just have to weather the storm. They're going to come at you. It can be very intimidating."
 Hitting early shots and gaining momentum just like the Rams did against Annapolis will be important. Villemure will look to Jackson to be a leader for the team again.
 "She likes to see that first one fall and we're going to need more of that on Thursday," Villemure said. "She's going to have to knock down four or five. Everybody is going to have to shoot the ball well."

The yen appreciated across the board as the Dow Jones drooped below Monday's lows. But the USD/JPY remained surprisingly steady as a stronger US dollar curbed yen's upside. The move higher in US yields offered support to the greenback versus G10 currencies. The 10-year rose to 0.85% while the DXY climbed for the second day in a row, erasing most of Monday's losses. Risk sentiment continues to be a key driver with the global growth outlook, policy response and the spread of the coronavirus, as critical factors. While the virus spreads all over the world, the number of new cases in China is falling. Also, headlines related to the oil price war could move markets.

 The Fannin County Children's Center has a new curriculum to share for child abuse prevention efforts.
 FCCC Executive Director Sandy Barber said in a news release Wednesday that gifts from The Matthews Children's Foundation, the Glaser Family Charitable Foundation and the MW and Fair Miller Foundation, helped the center purchase a new curriculum and supplies for child abuse prevention efforts with children and youth.
 The curriculum developed by the Women's Center of Tarrant County is called Play It Safe.
 Play it Safe is a child abuse awareness and prevention program that incorporates age-appropriate scripts and movies to teach children how to reduce their risk of sexual and physical abuse. It teaches them to recognize potentially abusive behavior, provides the tools to respond to threatening situations, and encourages them to report abuse to a trusted adult. It is an evidence-informed, age-appropriate risk reduction program for Pre-K through high school age students. Each grade level's interactive curriculum speaks to children in a way that they can best learn and respond.
 A more detailed list of what each class covers is available on the center's website at www.fanninccc.org. The Children's Center's staff are available to travel to local schools, churches and day cares to teach the classes. To schedule, contact Andrea Lappin at 903-583-4339 or andrea@fanninccc.org.

When Canada became the largest nation in the world to end the prohibition of pot in 2018, it put itself in opposition to international drug treaties that still ban the drug and prompted nervous hand-wringing by health officials worldwide. Those fears are overblown, according to Boudreau. "Initial data suggests that rates of cannabis use have not changed among youth and young adults (and) we have seen no increase in the illegal movement of cannabis across international borders.
 "We will continue to collect data and evaluate the impact of Canada's new regulatory framework and will ensure that any future decisions are well informed by this data."
 The speech comes in the wake of written remarks in a UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) report that questioned the wisdom of legalization, saying it "remains concerned at the legislative developments permitting the use of cannabis for 'recreational' uses.
 "Not only are these developments in contravention of the drug control conventions and the commitments made by states parties (but) the consequences for health and well-being, in particular of young people, are of serious concern."
 But the winds of change may slowly be reaching the UN, which seems to recognize the international prohibition on pot that has been in place since 1961 might need a refresh. "We have some fundamental issues around the conventions that state parties will need to start looking at," said Cornelis de Joncheere, president of the INCB, according to Marijuana Business Daily. "We have to recognize that the conventions were drawn up 50 and 60 years ago."
 He said next year would be "an appropriate time to look at whether those are still fit for purpose, or whether we need new alternative instruments and approaches to deal with these problems."
 Canada could no doubt lend a hand in those efforts and Boudreau took the opportunity to call attention to the country's use of a public-health approach to policy that aims to bring together all affected parties to help reduce the stigma surrounding the drug.
 "Canada is continuing to make efforts to reflect a broader range of voices in the design of all of our domestic drug policies, including civil society organizations, and people who use drugs."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia steamed ahead on Wednesday with its new energy play by directing the kingdom's oil company Aramco on Wednesday to increase its maximum production capacity, while Abu Dhabi's oil and gas company ADNOC followed suit by saying it was boosting output by 25% to 4 million barrels per day.
 Abu Dhabi's decision to increase production comes after Saudi Arabia took steps to essentially flood the market to dominate a greater share, after major oil producer Russia refused to go along with more production cuts. Meanwhile, global demand for oil is slowing down due to the outbreak of a new virus that's hampered travel and business.
 Saudi Arabia said this week it would increase its crude oil production to 12.3 million barrels a day starting in April. That's 300,000 barrels per day more than Aramco's current maximum sustained capacity. Now the company says it is boosting that output capacity to 13 million barrels per day, giving the kingdom greater maneuverability.
 Aramco did not say when that capacity increase would happen, according to Wednesday's announcement on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange. Late last year, the company floated 1.7% of its shares on the Tadawul, raising nearly $30 billion in the largest IPO in history.
 Aramco said the decision was a directive from the Saudi Energy Ministry. The kingdom's energy policy is largely directed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the country's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. The two are half-brothers and sons of the king.
 Saudi Arabia has been producing around 9.8 million barrels per day, carrying the bulk of cuts that were agreed upon by OPEC members and other major oil producers, namely Russia, to stave off an oversupply in the market that would further push prices down.
 Over the weekend, the kingdom's strategy dramatically pivoted when Russia refused to cooperate on further and deeper production cuts. It was expected that other OPEC member-states would follow suit and increase production in response to Saudi Arabia's moves.
 Abu Dhabi's ADNOC on Wednesday said it was responding to current market conditions and would increase output from about 3 million barrels to over 4 million barrels of oil a day starting next month. In addition, the company said it will accelerate plans for its 5 million barrel per day production capacity target.
 By increasing output and production, and slashing its official selling prices to Asia, analysts say it appears Saudi Arabia is now looking to pressure Russia by dominating market share, since it was unable to secure market price.
 The price war pushed the price of crude down 25% on Monday, the sharpest decline seen since the 1991 Gulf War. The price of international benchmark Brent crude recovered some on Tuesday and was trading around $36 a barrel on Wednesday.
 "The most likely outcome of this crisis is entrenchment into a painful process that lasts several weeks or months, until prices are low enough to change fundamental views in Moscow and Riyadh back to some form of compromise," according to political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group.
 Eurasia Group said that the price war will, meanwhile, exert pressure on U.S. crude exports, which recently hit a record 4 million barrels per day, because they will struggle to get their cargoes to clients at profit.

SABINE LAKE: GOOD. Water stained, visibility 1-3'; 65-66 degrees. Fishing conditions unchanged from the last report. Trout fishing is generally slow because the wind and weather just won't give us much of a break. However, if you can catch the right day between cold fronts and rain, there are trout to catch. They are continually moving, but when we find them, they are in the clearest water we can find. Best lures are Mirro Lure Lil Johns or Down South Lures on a 1/4-oz. jig. Corkies, Mirro Lure Catch 5, Mirrodine, or Borboleta suspending twitch baits are working as well. Redfish are a little easier to find than the trout right now. Mud shell flats adjacent to steeper shorelines, channel drops, and Entergy Outfall Canal are producing good catches of slot reds. Scattered catches of flounder are around the mouths of bayous and ditches on Sabine Lake and the Keith Lake Chain. Some flounder are on channel drops at Sabine Pass. Best baits are mud minnows and Gulp lures on a 1/4-to-1/8-oz. jig head. The main spring run has not yet started.

As a tool of child psychology, the series is able to see how lives have unfolded, at every crucial stage, with the benefit of hindsight, and it does seem to confirm the Philip Larkin edict about what one’s parents can do to you. It is even more effective, though, as a portrait of Britain through two decades. Some of the statistics are alarming, such as the growth of reported depression and anxiety in young people, but some are soothing, too, such as the reduction of stigma around discussing personal problems. Any potential for the mockery of a generation of “snowflakes” is given short shrift here, not pointedly, but by example. These young people are articulate, sensitive and sympathetic, and they are clearly also robust.

“Now we play Roncalli, which as the runner-up a year ago, and they present different problems.”
 The Crimson Pride (21-4), who have a pair of losses to No. 1 Omaha Skutt, are led by senior guard Jackson Dotzler’s 15.8 points and 5.7 assists per game. Senior guard Taden Red adds 14.9 ppg while sophomore forward Jacob Orr chips in 12.3.
 “They’re not quite as tall, but their guard play is quite good,” Creech said. “The Dotzler kid is probably all-state, and they get the ball into the Orr kid and he does a nice job in the paint.”
 The Tiger (21-3) are led by their own all-state candidate, senior point guard Connor Creech, who averages 16.4 points 5.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists.
 Haggan Hilgendorf, a 6-foot-9 senior, adds 13.6 points from both the inside and outside while senior forward Jacob Schroeder chips in 12.9 points.
 But it’s on the defensive end where the Tigers’ success might be determined.
 “It always starts with our defense,” Lance Creech said. “We have to guard without fouling. When you get into a state tournament, your depth isn’t as good as it was in December and you are up by 15. Everybody has good depth when you’re up by 15. In a one-and-done situation, you want your best players on the floor the whole time.”
 The coach said that undefeated Omaha Skutt is the clear favorite on paper. But with the Tigers owning wins over both potential semifinal opponents Alliance and Scottsbluff, they are certainly in the mix to be in Saturday’s final.
 “I think it’s a pretty open class after Skutt,” Lance Creech said.

The Fannin County Children's Center has a new curriculum to share for child abuse prevention efforts.
   
 FCCC Executive Director Sandy Barber said in a news release Wednesday that gifts from The Matthews Children's Foundation, the Glaser Family Charitable Foundation and the MW and Fair Miller Foundation, helped the center purchase a new curriculum and supplies for child abuse prevention efforts with children and youth.
   
 The curriculum developed by the Women's Center of Tarrant County is called Play It Safe.
   
 Play it Safe is a child abuse awareness and prevention program that incorporates age-appropriate scripts and movies to teach children how to reduce their risk of sexual and physical abuse. It teaches them to recognize potentially abusive behavior, provides the tools to respond to threatening situations, and encourages them to report abuse to a trusted adult. It is an evidence-informed, age-appropriate risk reduction program for Pre-K through high school age students. Each grade level's interactive curriculum speaks to children in a way that they can best learn and respond.
   
 A more detailed list of what each class covers is available on the center's website at www.fanninccc.org. The Children's Center's staff are available to travel to local schools, churches and day cares to teach the classes. To schedule, contact Andrea Lappin at 903-583-4339 or andrea@fanninccc.org.

Largemouth bass are on the rocks and docks both main lake and in coves in 2 to 10' also along shorelines leading to the back of spawning coves. Jigs, plastics, and moving baits like chatter baits and spinnerbaits are good starters. Hybrids and sand bass are also heading up the creeks and staging on points throughout the lake. Small grubs and swimbaits are good in the creeks, and crankbaits can be good in 4-10' on the points. Crappie are heading up the creeks and also starting to get shallower in the spawning coves. Some docks are starting to hold fish, as well as some of the brush piles in various depths. Jigs and minnows are both good choices; you just have to experiment. Catfish are good on the shallow north end of the lake and also moving shallow all over the lake. There are still some deep fish as well, so don't rule that out. Fresh cut shad is best.

ATLANTA (AP) — A proposal that would give Georgia voters a say in whether to allow casinos and other forms of gambling in the state has passed a state House committee. House Resolution 378 would ask voters whether the state Constitution should be amended to allow “all forms of betting, bingo games, raffles, and gambling” and create the Georgia Gaming Commission to regulate the industry. The legislation was approved by the House Regulated Industries Committee on Wednesday morning. It could soon move to the full House for more debate, though it faces a tight timeline to advance. Thursday is a legislative deadline by which bills must generally pass out of one chamber or the other to remain alive for the session. Committee Chairman Rep. Alan Powell, a Republican from Hartwell, said funds raised from sports betting would be directed to education while other funds would go toward health care. The legislation follows a House study committee that looked at the proposition in 2019. Democratic Rep. Al Williams of Midway, who participated in the study committee, said gambling could give the state a significant economic boost. “We are 180 strong,” Williams said, referring to the number of lawmakers in the Georgia House. “There are 11 million Georgians out there. Let them have the last say.” Mike Griffin, a lobbyist for the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, spoke out against the legislation and said that allowing gambling in Georgia would negatively impact communities.
