The development of Chabahar port which has been in the works close to two decades has been a little disappointing for both the Indians and the Iranians. The Chabahar Port project, conceptualized in 2003, saw Iran granting permission to India to use the port for transporting goods to landlocked Afghanistan.

“The five-run inning kind of helped us out, took some of the pressure off and allowed us to just play ball,” Belton coach Matt Blackburn said. “We didn’t try to do too much that was special, just get up there and hit the ball.”
 The Lady Tigers (13-7, 4-0 District 12-6A) did that to the tune of 15 hits, including nine for extra bases.
 “We know that once we get that first hit, it’s going to start going,” said Kelley, who’s always appreciative of the added run support. “So all we can do is cheer in the dugout and get loud.”
 Madison Lux finished 3-for-4 with a double, a triple and two RBIs for Belton. Paige Nunes had two hits and scored four times, Bethany Sherwood went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and Autumn Holman had a pair of singles in the Lady Tigers’ offensive outpouring, which helped offset a handful of defensive miscues along the way.
 “We have to play better,” said Blackburn, whose team committed three errors in Temple’s three-run fifth and four overall. “It’s kind of been our M.O. this year: give up some hits, make some errors and hope you outscore them.”
 Kelley closed her complete game with her ninth strikeout of the matinee rivalry contest. She allowed a first-inning solo home run to Lily Wiser then settled in after that, surrendering just two hits the rest of the way.
 Hesse also went the distance, fanning three in the loss.
 Temple’s 1-0 lead provided by Wiser’s no-doubter over the wall in center field was short-lived.
 Belton scored twice on two hits and two errors — Temple had six errors in all — in the bottom of the first, which featured Sherwood’s RBI fly out and Lux’s RBI triple that chased in Parker.
 “I just feel like Hesse did her job. We just didn’t do our part in the field. We have to do better,” Temple first-year head coach Le-Net Franklin said after coaching against her alma mater for the first time. “We’re a young team but that’s not an excuse for some of the routine plays that we have to take care of. They know we have to clean up certain areas and communicate a little bit more. Other than that, I think they have it figured out.”
 Run-scoring doubles from Sherwood and Lux, and Seeliger’s line-drive home run to left field in the third made it 7-1.
 Parker boosted it to 8-1 in the fourth with an RBI triple, and the Lady Tigers tacked on two more on a wild pitch and error to carry a 10-1 advantage into the fifth.
 “They caught on to us pitching out more and crowded the plate, so we tried to push them off a little bit,” Hesse said. “That started to work toward the end, but I think we started that too late.”
 LeeAna Quinones and Alena Salazar had singles for Temple (10-8, 1-2) in the fifth, when Quinones, Cameryn Stewart and Elise Munoz all came around to score.
 Parker, though, all but sealed the outcome with her home run in Belton’s half of the fifth.
 The Lady Tigers now are off until next Tuesday while the Tem-Cats jump right back into district action at 2 p.m. today at home against Killeen.
 “We don’t want to let this affect us,” Hesse said. “We want it to push us to work harder and bounce back.”

BEIJING -- Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak on Tuesday, the first time he has done so since the epidemic began and a sign that Beijing believes its efforts to control the virus are working.
 His arrival in the city, where the virus is believed to have first taken hold late last year, comes after its spread in mainland China has sharply slowed in the past week and as attention has turned to preventing imported infections from overseas hot spots such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.
 News of the visit gave a lift to Chinese stocks, with the blue-chip index climbing back into positive territory after falling as much as 1% in morning trade.
 "It is obvious that Xi could not have visited Wuhan earlier because the risk of him contracting the virus there was initially too high," Zhang Ming, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, told Reuters.
 "He is there now to reap the harvest. His being there means the CCP (Communist Party of China) may declare victory against the virus soon," Zhang said.
 China came in for criticism at home and globally over its early response to the outbreak, suppressing information and downplaying its risks, but its draconian efforts at control, including the lock-down of Wuhan and Hubei province where it is originated, have been effective at curbing the spread.
 Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, said on Tuesday it would implement a "health code" system to allow people in areas at a medium or low risk of contracting the coronavirus to start traveling.
 During his trip to Wuhan, Xi will "visit and express regards to medical workers, military officers and soldiers, community workers, police officers, officials and volunteers who have been fighting the epidemic on the front line, as well as patients and residents during the inspection," state news agency Xinhua said.
 Separately, Taiwan's government said on Tuesday a second round of evacuations of its citizens who had been stranded in Wuhan had begun, after weeks of arguments between the Chinese-claimed island and Beijing over the arrangements.
 NEW CASES FALL
 Mainland China had 19 new coronavirus infections on Monday, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday, down from 40 a day earlier. It also marked the third straight day of no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases outside of Hubei.
 Of the new cases, 17 were in Wuhan, while one was in Beijing and one other in Guangdong due to people arriving from abroad, according to the health authority.
 That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,754.
 However, Chinese authorities have ramped up warnings about the risks from foreigners and Chinese nationals traveling to China from viral hot spots abroad such as Iran and Italy.
 The one case in Beijing on Monday was due to a traveler from Britain, and the one in Guangdong was an imported case from Spain. As of Monday, there have been 69 imported cases.
 More than 114,300 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and over 4,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.
 Outside China, Italy, South Korea and Iran have rerported the most cases and deaths.
 Since the outbreak, 59,897 patients have been discharged from hospitals in China. Recently discharged patients need to go into quarantine for 14 days.
 In Wuhan, 12 of the 14 temporary hospitals dedicated to treating coronavirus patients have closed, with the remaining two due to shut on Tuesday.
 On Saturday, a small hotel used to quarantine people under observation in southern Fujian province collapsed, killing 20, while 10 had yet to be rescued.
 Of the 71 people inside the hotel in Quanzhou city at the time of the collapse, 58 were in under quarantine, the Quanzhou city government said.
 As of the end of Monday, the overall death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China reached 3,136, up by 17 from the previous day.
 Hubei reported 17 new deaths, all of which were in Wuhan.
 Xi, who was mostly absent from Chinese state media coverage of the crisis in its early days, has become for more visible in recent weeks.
 The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid published by the official People's Daily, on Tuesday detailed the various instructions and actions Xi had given and taken between Jan. 7 and March 2 to combat the epidemic.
 "Xi personally commands the people's war against the epidemic. He has been paying constant attention to the epidemic prevention and control work and made oral or written instructions every day," the newspaper said.

Stefanik repeatedly uses the moniker “Taxin’ Tedra” against Cobb for some of her votes as a St. Lawrence County legislator.
 Stefanik recently voted against anti-vaping legislation because it would have contained an excise tax.
 Cobb pointed out that taxes, like the gas tax, are used to pay for roads. “Sin” taxes on alcohol go toward substance abuse programs.
 IMPEACHMENT EFFECT
 The impeachment of President Donald Trump thrust the 21st Congressional District into the national spotlight with the high-profile questioning by Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, of witnesses during the hearings. Stefanik’s national profile grew, and with it, people donated more than $2 million to Cobb’s campaign because she is running to unseat the three-term congresswoman.
 Cobb pointed out that most of the contributions that flooded in during the impeachment hearing were small donations of an average of about $27 per person.
 Cobb added that the money will help to get the message out. Last time around, Cobb emerged from an 11-person primary field with no money for the general election and had to start from scratch.
 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has not committed any resources at this point, according to Cobb.
 “DCCC has been helpful, but they’ve not called the race red to blue — yet,” she said.
 Cobb said she does not want this race to be a referendum on Trump, but rather on the need to have someone in Congress who is an independent voice and has lived, worked and volunteered in the community.
 “There are two kinds of people who run, those who run for their ego and those who run to serve their community. I am running to serve my community,” she said.

Cobb hit familiar themes throughout the 45-minute discussion including attacking Stefanik’s record on health care, the economy and entitlements.
 “It’s important to remember that Elise Stefanik wrote the plan in 2012 to privatize Social Security and Medicare. As we see the stock market right now, I’m not willing to gamble people’s future,” she said.
 Cobb criticized Stefanik for her vote to use taxpayer money to argue the lawsuit currently before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act now that Congress has repealed the tax penalty that was imposed if people did not have health insurance.
 Cobb said she knows what it was like when her daughter, who has celiac disease, needed emergency surgery. Cobb did not think twice about ordering MRIs or other tests because she had excellent health insurance. About a month after that crisis, Cobb lost her health care insurance.
 ‘THEY’RE HAVING
 A HARD TIME’
 Cobb said despite the president’s claims of a strong economy, people in the North Country are still living paycheck to paycheck.
 “They’re having a hard time paying for health care. They’re having a hard time paying for college. They’re having a hard time putting food on the table or putting gas in the car,” she said.
 She grew up in a home with one biological brother and nine adopted siblings. Her parents took on teenagers that were “hard-to-place.” The family had to make sacrifices, which led to Cobb saying that chicken surprise was a favorite meal because if she found the chicken, it was a surprise.
 “I cannot tell you how many people have emailed with recipes or with stories — stories of their parent struggling to put food on the table,” she said. “As we talk about this economy, there are people being left behind.”
 WIC VOUCHERS
 Cobb also recalled a story when times were lean before she went back to work after giving birth, when she needed to use WIC vouchers for a time. She said one time the grocery clerk was being difficult because Cobb was attempting to buy one 2-pound block of cheese instead of the two 1-pound blocks that were required.
 She said she wanted to turn around and tell the people in line that she was working and not just living on benefits.
 “I know what it’s like for people who are working so hard, and I’m running against someone who seems to be so disconnected from that everyday experience,” she said.
