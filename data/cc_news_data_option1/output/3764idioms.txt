"Obviously, we did not play the game that we needed to play. We needed to eliminate all of the explosive plays on defense. We didn't do that. We had to do a good job of moving the ball, staying third and manageable. We actually did that in the first half on offense, but we didn't score when we got our chances in the red zone. We just didn't do enough as a team to really do anything against these guys. When you play a good team, even with the guys they had down, we have to find a way to be more consistent and play complementary football at some point."

"I thought Jimmy made some good plays. We had a long drive that would not have happened if he didn't scramble. He had a hell of a play on that to keep the drive going or it would have been three-and-out, and it led to a touchdown. I thought that was huge. He hurt his ankle pretty early and tried to battle through it. He couldn't go anymore at halftime. I thought ﻿Nick Mullens﻿ came in and made a couple of big plays. For the most part, we were running the ball and he didn't have to do a ton. I know he messed up (on the interception). That ball was a little high from what I saw. I think he'll be a lot more ready next week with the preparation."

"(For) ﻿Jimmy Garoppolo﻿, a high ankle sprain is what we have now. ﻿Nick Bosa﻿ is most likely an ACL. We have to confirm that tomorrow, but most likely. ﻿Solomon Thomas﻿, from what I'm told, is a little bit in the same boat as Bosa, but he has a better chance of it not being that from what I'm told, but we'll wait to see. ﻿Raheem Mostert﻿, I don't think it was that. He has some knee issues from the game on that turf."

"I feel like we got a good rhythm moving the ball," Darnold said. "It's just about finishing in the red zone. And it's about having consistent plays on second and third down."

"We obviously don't want those guys hurt," Denver tight end Noah Fant said. "They would help us a lot right now, but we've just got to keep pressing forward, and you know it's one of those things where we've just got to get with the guys we got and try to score and try to stop teams. It says a lot about our team to stay with a great Pittsburgh team, but obviously not good enough."

It takes a long time for a web browser to build up a reasonable market share. And creating, maintaining and improving a web browser is an enormous amount of work. Far too much work for a tiny development team or single developer. Most web browsers fall by the wayside. And when they are dead they remain dead -- there's rarely a phoenix from the flames.

And because the Arizona Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30 — which would narrow the window for McConnell if the Democratic candidate, Mark Kelly, wins.

Taking the stage at a North Carolina rally to chants of “Fill that seat,” the president said he would nominate his selection despite Democrats' objections. And, after conducting what he joked was a “very scientific poll" of the Fayetteville crowd as to whether supporters wanted a man or a woman, he declared the choice would be “a very talented, very brilliant woman."

In Game 1, Michael Porter Jr. looked as if he had never been on a stage as big as the Western Conference Finals. Although he padded stats during garbage time, the 22-year-old rookie from Missouri clanked jumpers early, when the Lakers took it to Denver. But here's what you love about MPJ and the Nuggets' future: In Game 2, Porter took another step of growth, looking comfortable at the adult table, unafraid to grab his fair share of meat and potatoes. MPJ finished with 15 points.

There's still a package for Fifth in the Arch User Repository (for Arch and Arch-based distributions) but it fails to build. That's not really important, as while the project's website is still up, the program is as dead as a dodo. A shame, as Fifth ticked quite a few boxes, particularity as it tried to avoid the bloat commonly associated with web browsers. Who really thinks a web browser consuming multiple GBs of RAM is desirable?

So they put down their baskets and fishing poles, hung up their hats in the trees and the boys took off their coats and hung them up too, and one boy had an old Waterbury watch and he hung that in the tree and it said, “c, k, c, k”.
