Francesca, nella sua lunga riflessione, in riferimento a Temptation, parla di _ "esperimento ipnotico"._ Subito dopo si domanda come il pubblico ( _la trasmissione è stata seguitissima anche in questa stagione_ ) possa credere a chi mette in piedi _" strategie studiate per monetizzare"_ con " _altre ospitate "._ E ancora la giornalista si chiede come le coppie che prendono parte allo show possano " _sopravvivere_ " a _" mortificazioni, bugie e offese"_ di una simile natura.

"The Essentials" section contains all of the basics you'll need to get movie night up and running, while "The Extras" is full of fun things you don't _need_ to have but that might make the experience a little nicer. Although it may feel like this is a lot of stuff to purchase, pretty much all of it can be reused for other purposes like camping or just chilling on your back patio, so you'll get a little more bang for your buck.

Desideriamo ricordavi che la nostra più grande preoccupazione in questo periodo è che le istituzioni perdano di vista la cosa più importante: i bambini ed i ragazzi. Loro hanno perso mesi di socialità, insegnamento ed interazione a causa di una chiusura delle scuole per l’emergenza Covid, per un tempo senza precedenti in rapporto a tutti gli altri paesi europei.   Sul nostro territorio gli Istituti scolastici, solo in pochi casi, sono riusciti a proseguire il programma con una DAD appena sufficiente per fornire un valido insegnamento agli alunni.   Il nostro timore è che al fatidico avvio dell’anno scolastico le linee guida del MIUR, l’interpretazione da parte dei dirigenti ed eventualmente l’indisponibilità di spazi sufficienti sul territorio, porti nuovamente i nostri figli a dover usufruire della DAD.   Questo sistema di didattica non può essere considerato un valido sostituto (se non per un breve e giustificato periodo) nell’approccio umano degli insegnanti verso i nostri bambini e ragazzi. Noi genitori lo abbiamo sperimentato personalmente e vari esperti lo hanno confermato. Questo sistema non può e non deve essere tenuto in considerazione ulteriormente come ripiego di comodo per non prendersi degli impegni e delle responsabilità da parte di tutti.

In the study, the researchers used a technique called electrolyte gating. They took the non-magnetic iron sulfide material and put it in a device in contact with an ionic solution, or electrolyte, comparable to Gatorade. They then applied as little as 1 volt (less voltage than a household battery), moved positively charged molecules to the interface between the electrolyte and the iron sulfide, and induced magnetism. Importantly, they were able to turn off the voltage and return the material to its non-magnetic state, meaning that they can reversibly switch the magnetism on and off.

While most celebs hunkered down in their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas were some of the few A-list celebs paparazzi could regularly count on being out and about no matter what.  
 Since making things official right around the time the world went into shutdown mode, Ben and Ana have regularly been captured by paps walking their dogs, house hunting, getting locked out, nuzzling in their masks (other times without), laughing--always laughing, and toting Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee on the daily. The mundanity of it all has seemingly become a kind of comfort reminiscent of times pre-Covid.
 What it's also done is give onlookers another glimpse at Ben and Ana's somewhat mysterious relationship. For a while, all fans knew was that the couple got to know each other on the set of their film _Deep Water_ back __in 2019. __ Then, they were photographed in Cuba together a few months later. Since then, the bulk of public knowledge about this couple has been pieced together from the paparazzi content that's flooded the internet without context or explanation over these last few months.
 So it's understandable if you're after some concrete answers.
 While you _could_ __assume isolating together has been working out for them, you can never really know with these things. That's where a body language analyst likeKaren Donaldson comes in clutch. The expert took a look the couple's moves and explained what each means for the fate of their relationship. All the details this way:

Advocate Prashant Bhushan on Saturday filed a petition in the Supreme Court, seeking withdrawal of the contempt notice issued against him on July 22 over his alleged derogatory tweets against the judiciary and another order passed by the court on July 24 to list a case from 2009 for hearing.
 Bhushan filed the petition against the secretary-general of the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, which allows individuals to move the top court to seek redressal for the violation of their fundmental rights.
 Bhushan contended that the complaint filed by advocate Mahek Maheshwari against him was defective. “It is submitted that the contempt petition filed by Mahek Maheshwari against the Petitioner pertaining to a tweet posted by the Petitioner on his Twitter handle was defective in as much as the consent of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General had not been obtained contrary to the mandate of Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 and Rule 3 (c) of the Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court 1975,” Bhushan said, according to a copy of his petition accessed by _Scroll.in_.
 Bhushan also argued that by taking note of Maheshwari’s complaint, the top court had ignored the requirement of taking the consent of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General, and did “indirectly what the Court could not have directly”.
 The advocate also accused the secretary-general of “illegally” putting the case before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra and said that the chief justice is the “master of the roster”.
 Bhushan argued that the contempt proceedings, initiated in disregard of the established law, amounted to a violation of his right to personal liberty. He added that the “sudden listing” of the 11-year old contempt case against him involved “malice in law”.
 Earlier in the day, Bhushan, Union minister Arun Shourie and journalist N Ram filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, which the petitioners argue is “unconstitutional and against the basic structure of the Constitution”.
 On July 21, the Supreme Court initiated suo motu criminal contempt proceedings against advocate Prashant Bhushan and social media platform Twitter India. The next day, the top court issued notices to Bhushan and Attorney General KK Venugopal for the lawyer’s alleged derogatory tweets against the judiciary. The case will be heard again on August 5.
 The Supreme Court, on July 24, had adjourned the hearing of another contempt case against advocate Bhushan till August 4. Bhushan had made some remarks against Supreme Court judges in an interview to _Tehelka_ magazine 11 years ago, in 2009. The contempt of court case was filed by advocate Harish Salve.

Opening a new business is always stressful, but opening a new business during a pandemic brings with it even more hurdles and obstacles to overcome.
 That’s what Ashton Tremble did, opening Mini & Me, a baby and children’s boutique, which opened on June 30 at 378 Garafraxa Street South in Durham.
 “I think a lot of business owners experienced hurdles during this pandemic, it was not easy for anyone,” Tremble said. “When I decided to open my own store it was before COVID-19 was a thing. When I did decide to open my store I experienced some slight negative feedback from a couple business owners, but so much support from so many others. I didn’t let that hold me back, we just had our normal obstacles and hurdles like any other store trying to open.
 “COVID-19 obviously made it a little more difficult, effecting my opening date, trying to stay up to date on the new and quickly changing rules and regulations, and just trying to make sure everything was safe for the public.”
 Tremble’s original plan was to open Mini & Me at the beginning of April.
 “I say this often but COVID-19 was truly a blessing and a damper on my new business,” Tremble said. “With those few extra months that delayed me opening my store it actually helped me plan how I wanted everything set up in my store. I had the help of my father-in-law’s business, Candue Homes, and friends and family to help clean up my store. Without their help my store wouldn’t look like it does now.”
 The delay of Mini & Me’s opening date due to the pandemic did add more stress for Tremble as well.
 “I had all of my inventory in my basement of my house just sitting in the spare room,” Tremble said. “I would be lying if I told you that I didn’t have the slightest bit of fear that all my money went to waste for inventory and renovations when they announced COVID-19. I luckily had an online store that helped me make sales during these hard times and get me started.”
 Tremble said she has had vast support of her community, her true friends and family.
 “And having that circle to motivate me has made it that much better getting me to where I am right now,” Tremble said. “It’s amazing how a community can come together during a pandemic while opening a new business. I had numerous messages from the day I opened from a lot of local businesses in Durham wishing me luck, and applauding me for sticking to my guns and still opening my store after they realized how difficult it was to open a storefront during a global pandemic and amidst a busy time in my life.”
 Tremble said she also received support from people she never thought would be messaging her with positive feedback.
 “It just goes to show you that there are still good people out there,” Tremble said. “I love seeing all the new and familiar faces that come into my store. I have had so many people comment on how this kind of store is needed desperately in our area.
 “More times than not, we are all caught travelling to the city or ordering online for good quality and name brand clothing. It is so hard to find that in a small town. I am so happy to say that my days have been busy with customers coming in and out.”
 If anyone knew Tremble from high school, she said, they always knew she wanted to open up her own store.
 “It was always up in the air on what type of store I wanted to open,” Tremble said. “My ideas would go back and forth constantly. It finally hit me when I had my daughter Kinsley that I wanted to open up a baby and children’s boutique.
 “We gave my daughter a nickname when she was probably one month old which was ‘Kinny Mini’ so it only made sense to brand my store name around her, my biggest inspiration. That is where Mini & Me’s name came from. I always knew I wanted to open my own store, it just took the right timing, a little perseverance and a lot of commitment on my end to make it finally come to life. I knew, and still know, that this wasn’t going to be an easy journey, but when its something that matters deep in your heart, you find a way anyways. This is just the beginning for Mini & Me.”
 At Mini & Me, sizes go from newborn to youth size 12, and a variety of products are sold at the store, such as apparel (pyjamas, rompers, sleep sacks, t-shirts, sweaters, leggings, shorts, swim suits, dresses, to name a few).
 There are also feeding products, swaddle blankets, car seat covers, nursing covers, nursing bras, Yumboxes, shoes, hats, straws, soothers, teething toys, stain remover sticks, bibs (fashion bibs and for meals), grow with me mats, hello world swaddle blankets and hat, diaper bags, baby carriers, activity mats, step stools, baby lotion, diaper cream, washcloths and mama sweaters.
 “With fall/winter coming up I will be bringing in rain boots, raincoats and winter coats,” Tremble said.
 Opening hours for Mini & Me are part time at the moment since Tremble doesn’t have daycare for her daughter yet.
 Currently, Mini & Me is open Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 Come August, Mini & Me is expected to be open Tuesday to Saturday. Find Mini & Me online at www.miniandme.ca.

The eight week rule is to help you sit tight and not react too quickly to its jump in value. It’s likely some investors will take their profits off the table too quickly too early, which causes the stock to contract somewhat, but holding for eight weeks will help you avoid that rush to cash in your chips too early, when the stock, if held, could go on to make even further gains.

In 1950, money thrown into empty sake barrels around town funded the creation of the Hiroshima Carp, the city’s famed baseball team, while black market vendors started serving a new culinary craze called _okonomiyaki_ , a savory layered crepe that has become the city’s signature dish.
 “When the Hiroshima Carp was born, we survivors thought it was at last possible to overcome our fear and hold out some hope for the future,” Ogura says. “We thought, ‘Maybe we can survive. Maybe we can have a nice day, like before.’”
 The Allied Occupation of Japan ended in 1952 and, slowly, people’s lives began returning to normal. On Aug. 6 that same year, children orphaned by the Hiroshima bomb unveiled the Cenotaph for the A-bomb Victims, the city’s first official A-bomb memorial. Standing in the heart of the Peace Memorial Park, it bears the words, “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.”

Editor's note: While Harold Bubil takes some time off, we'll reprise some of his popular columns. This column originally ran on Oct. 7, 2017.
   
 It's not on the beach. It doesn't have what you would call great boating water. In fact, you have to walk across the street to get to the dock.
   
 Despite those locational shortcomings, the gleaming, big-windowed mansion near the Sarasota-Bradenton airport, built for Annette Theissen in 1998, is an icon of contemporary architecture in Florida.
   
 Designed by Guy Peterson when he was still with Johnson Peterson Architects, the house is the ultimate expression of what I call "millennial modernism" in the Sarasota-Bradenton area.
   
 With six bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and three full kitchens (and several smaller ones) in 9,700 square feet, the house marked a transition for local modernism from the more modest beach houses to bona fide showplaces.
   
 Its location on the widest point of Sarasota Bay makes it a well-known landmark for boaters north of the Ringling mansion, Ca' d'Zan.
   
 The house's elevation, landscaping and windows make the most of its bay views while minimizing the view of Longbay Boulevard's pavement.
   
 Cars certainly cannot be heard through the impact-resistant, insulated glass.
   
 Nor can jet aircraft at Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport, just across U.S. 41 to the east.
   
 "You don't hear anything in this house," said Realtor Kim Ogilvie, of Michael Saunders & Co., in a 2014 feature story on the house, which she had just listed for sale. White noise from the gurgling water in the foyer's reflecting pool negates unwanted sounds.
   
 The Theissen Residence has been updated, so the house still has a timeless appeal despite its 20 years, which is considered old for a Bayfront mansion.
   
 The house most recently sold in July 2017 for $3.55 million.
   
 "It was pivotal in my career," Peterson said of the Theissen project, which began in 1995.
   
 "Annette was an amazing client. Her charge to me was, 'I want the architecture to speak for itself.' The only other requirement was that she wanted to see the bay from her kitchen," Peterson told the Herald-Tribune in 2014.
   
 "The rest of it is up to you," Theissen told him.
   
 Peterson added, "She gave me a great deal of latitude to try and sculpt space. It did definitely serve as a stepping stone for me, and refocused my practice into primarily doing one-of-a-kind houses."
   
 More recently, Peterson received the American Institute of Architects' 2016 Gold Medal from its Florida/Caribbean chapter. The Guy Peterson Office for Architecture was named AIA Florida's Firm of the Year in 2013.
   
 "Florida Buildings I Love" is Harold Bubil's homage to the Sunshine State's built environment.

 Wigan appeared on course to stay up again this term after a spectacular run of form since the start of 2020, but they were deducted 12 points after entering administration and went on to be relegated.
 While they have launched an appeal - they would have finished 13th without the points sanction - Cook announced his departure on Saturday with a "heavy heart".
 "It is well publicised that the club is going through an incredibly challenging period and, of course, we are all hoping a positive outcome can be found so this football club can write its next chapter under new ownership," he said in a statement.
 "That has to be the main priority for everyone involved and I know the administrators are working hard to ensure the club can get through these difficult times and find new owners.
 "I want to thank every player for their efforts, hard work and commitment during my three years as manager. I would like to thank my assistant Leam Richardson and as a collective I thank all of my support staff and the staff behind the scenes who are so pivotal to the football club.
 "We must also not forget the 75 people who unfortunately lost their jobs a few weeks ago and I hope for those people that the club can find a positive solution and move forwards in the near future."
 Cook has been linked with the vacancy at Bristol City, while he was also rumoured to be in the running for the Birmingham City job before the appointment of Aitor Karanka.

El archivo jugó, además, un papel central en su decisión de escribir en castellano, porque el aprendizaje de la escritura, decía, «tiene que ver con la lengua literaria que te resulta más familiar», y en su caso, aunque en su hogar se hablara catalán, era el castellano, por la influencia del cine y de la «literatura de quiosco».

En 1990 publicó _El amante bilingüe_ , una novela paródica que plantea el conflicto a través de la esquizofrenia del protagonista. En el apogeo de su carrera, cuando la literatura catalana fue invitada de honor en la Feria del Libro de Fráncfort, y el Govern pidió a los principales autores catalanes en lengua castellana que acudiesen para apoyar a las letras en catalán, Marsé echó leña al fuego de una polémica encrespada: «Ir de telonero me parece el colmo», arguyó.

OVIEDO, 1 Ago. (EUROPA PRESS) -
    El presidente del Principado de Asturias, Adrián Barbón, ha asegurado este sábado que el acuerdo de concertación para la recuperación de Asturias "es la concertación para afrontar la gran transformación de Asturias" y ha manifestado que el Ejecutivo tomará este pacto como fundamento y referencia para la negociación del presupuesto y de los acuerdos de reconstrucción.
    Adrián Barbón, ha suscrito este sábado con CCOO, UGT y la Federación Asturiana de Empresarios (FADE) la Concertación para la Recuperación de Asturias (CREA), "un gran acuerdo social para impulsar la reconstrucción económica y superar los desafíos que aguardan a la comunidad autónoma, como la transición energética".
    "Se trata de un pacto excepcional para una situación excepcional", ha dicho el presidente de la región, que ha indicado que este pacto también es un marco idóneo para la orientación estratégica de los próximos fondos europeos, fundamentales para encaminar la transformación económica y social de Asturias.
    En este sentido Adrián barbón ha querido dejar claro que el Ejecutivo asturiano "siempre estará dispuesto a trabajar con quienes quieran colaborar y sumar en la búsqueda de ese horizonte". "La madurez y compromiso que han demostrado CCOO, UGT y FADE han de ser un estímulo para todos nosotros", ha dicho.
    Este acuerdo supone la movilización de un montante de 640 millones de euros con 182 medidas concretas para los próximos 16 meses comprendidas en un documento de casi 170 páginas. Unas medidas que suponen "el comienzo de un camino a recorrer juntos en los próximos meses", según los agentes sociales.
    Se trata de una concertación "exprés, un acuerdo de urgencia" que será revisada a finales de año y que recoge una importante novedad como es la creación de la figura de los delegados y delegadas de igualdad en las empresas.

    Por su parte el secretario general de la UGT Asturias, Javier Fernández Lanero, ha destacado que estamos ante "momentos muy difíciles donde hay que hacer muchas cosas con pocos recursos, por eso es cuando más se necesita capacidad de diálogo y altura de miras".
    El sindicalista ha manifestado que este acuerdo debe servir de ejemplo para que en el parlamento ocurra lo mismo y se llegue a acuerdos dejando los intereses partidistas de un lado.
    Desde CCOO, su secretario general, José Manuel Zapico ha destacado que el de hoy es un día muy importante para la región con la firma de este acuerdo en "tiempos de emergencia" después de que el coronavirus haya demostrado la fragilidad de nuestro modelo económico y haya sacado a la luz las desigualdades.
    Al igual que UGT, el líder de CCOO ha insistido en que la sociedad reclama diálogo y acuerdo y que todas las partes antepongan los intereses generales a los particulares.
    Desde la patronal asturiana, el presidente de la FADE, Belarmino Feito, ha incidido en que aunque pueda parecer que el documento sea fruto de una negociación rápida, la misma "ha sido muy intensa", y ha destacado que todas las partes hayan sido capaces de llegar tan rápido a "un acuerdo deseado y necesario".
    "En marzo estábamos inmersos en una negociación para una concertación de legislatura pero ha habido un cambio de escenario y no sabemos a partir de ahora con qué nos vamos a encontrar", ha dicho Feito, que ha insistido en que esta es una "concertación de responsabilidad que sienta las bases para cuando se vayan eliminando las incertidumbres".
    Feito ha indicado que hay muchos retos por delante y Asturias deberá esforzarse "más y mejor" en años venideros, una cuestión a la que FADE se compromete.

Many of the new systems listed incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to reduce false positives to a minimum – a key issue with first generation systems – and help jam swarms of hostile UASs. AI also allows kinetic mitigation systems – such as C-UAS drones and intelligent munitions – to communicate with each other in flight. While AI will undoubtedly be vital in combating threats from drones whose physical coordinates and electronic signatures have been catalogued and input into a threat database, its use against home-built or entirely new designs is still uncertain, especially if they fly pre-programmed routes and do not rely on global navigation satellite systems.

For LalaChai, it was. The restaurant decided to pare down its part-time employees’ shifts and transition to a takeout and delivery-only model throughout the shutdown.
 “We started reaching people who wouldn’t normally come to the restaurant,” says Nakayama. “In our current situation… takeout service is definitely the way to go.”
 The Thai restaurant is also exploring new revenue streams like a subscription service and an online marketplace for merchandise and other food products.
 Meanwhile, as case numbers in Tokyo seemed to stabilize in June, all three restaurants moved toward resuming regular service.
 “I remember when we had our reopening,” says Yoshihara. “I went out to see the line and it was all regulars. I bowed to every one of them, saying ‘thank you.’”
 But even if customers were ready to dine out again, in a time when crowds and confined spaces are equally frowned upon, it can be difficult to reconcile what a restaurant is and what it should be. Social-distancing measures further the disconnect.
 “I don’t think I ever had the fear that we wouldn’t reopen,” says Sekita, “but I think there was this feeling of, when we do reopen, what is that going to look like?”
 The same concerns loom at Tonki, which used to seat around 35 guests in its downstairs area and dozens more upstairs. Now, it keeps a buffer seat between groups and seats the upstairs only sparingly.
 “Having the customers close together was always a part of our appeal,” says Yoshihara. “The feeling of busyness, people running around and eating close to each other. And now we can’t do that. It’s a shame. But we can’t afford any risks.”
 LalaChai has noticed that even after in-store dining has become available, many of its newfound customers have continued to gravitate toward takeout.
 “These customers have their reasons, besides for coronavirus, for why they prefer takeout,” he says. “But that’s perfectly fine, since they’re ordering from us two or three times a week.”
 All three restaurants are still dealing with a noticeable decrease in sales, as well as a dramatic shift in expectations in what they thought was going to be an Olympic year in Tokyo, which would have led to a surge of international customers. The very reason Nakayama decided to open LalaChai in 2020 was to market it to those visiting for July’s Games.
 “Our foreign customer base has been lost for now,” says Tonki's Yoshihara, who says that, prior to the pandemic, foreign visitors accounted for as much as 50 percent of customers on a busy day. “I’m sure there were hard times in the past, but from what I’ve seen and experienced, this is no doubt the toughest time we’ve ever gone through.”

Best Place on Earth to See Stars – Where They Can Finally Be Seen Without Their Twinkle

Dogs have been chasing cats into trees since the dawn of recorded history.
 In a twist of cosmic irony, Sirius—the dog star—made its annual appearance in the early evening sky on July 3—the same day that “cotton” started blowing off of cottonwood trees. This signaled the onset of channel catfish spawning time in lakes and rivers across southern Wisconsin.
 Falling “cotton” doesn’t trigger carnal nature of bewhiskered, fork-tailed fish, of course.
 Water temperature does. When water temperatures rise to 78 degrees in early July, male catfish move into depressions in root balls of fallen trees and similar areas—including old tires and oil drums that used to litter so much of Rock River.
 Sultry days heat both the breeze and the water, with the impact of falling cottonwood seeds not lost upon old river rats who have taken the time to marvel at the wonders of nature.
 After spawning, the male channel catfish—which are sometimes mistakenly called blue cats because of the spawning colors male fish tend to develop—viciously guard the nest, striking at any threat that comes close, like fishing lures.
 New broods of little catfish are now swimming in their respective ecosystems, augmenting a burgeoning population of more young-of-year baitfish, insects amphibians and other wild critters great and small.
 There is so much food in the water that even omnivorous channel catfish display a modicum of depression regarding culinary preferences. In simple terms: The bite is tough for human predators in their quest to hook up with fish of any stripe or whisker.
 “Stink bait” is by far the most effective channel catfish bait during the warm-water period. Although this description is spot on, in addition to being the source of significant stains in clothing, catfish connoisseurs prefer the more elegant and accurate term “dip bait.”
 About 30 years ago, an old river rat named “Sonny” Hootman achieved the pinnacle of dip bait perfection with his “Sonny’s Super Sticky Channel Cat Bait.” The brand is still around, but like many great products, was purchased by a big company and cheapened considerably.
 I became good friends with Hootman back when his bait was just beginning to get sticky attention of consumers and carpets across the Midwest. He would never reveal proprietary ingredients, but mentioned soybean oil is a great way to thin consistency of his bait, with cattail fuzz the best additive when bait gets too runny.
 Turtle livers are a great additive for blood-bait recipes. But harvest of these amphibians has been curtailed considerably by the DNR in recent years. Fresh chicken liver will suffice. Once added it should be allowed to ferment in the sun for at least a few days.
 Hexagenia, more commonly known as “shad flies” or “May flies” are another outstanding dip bait additive procured from under a street light after a major hatch comes off. A cupful of flies per pint of bait is a good ratio.
 But even with this odoriferous frosting, channel cats—which have been chased into the shade of trees during dog-days’ weather conditions—often need to be finessed to put a bend in a fishin’ pole. Once a productive current seam upstream from a deadfall has been established, use no heavier than a 1/8-ounce egg sinker to drop a baited dipworm to the bottom in that seam.
 A “skinny” dipbait worm with roughly the diameter of a No. 2 lead pencil is the best way to present bait. These worms have a No. 8 treble hook in the tail. They are about 3½ inches long out of the package. Cutting about an inch off the top end of these worms makes them more effective for finicky dog-days cats.
 There will still be plenty of hot, sultry days when summer’s dog days come to an end Aug. 11. But water temperatures actually start to cool down a few degrees by then.
 This cooling water isn’t as easy to observe as “cotton” floating on the water or doves and bluewinged teal that are the vanguard of bird migration. But this precursor of autumn will be here very soon.

 "The priority is to celebrate this title and then go for the Swiss Cup," he said, with Young Boys away to Luzern on August 6 in the quarter-finals, which were suspended due to the pandemic.
 "At 27, I still have some room for improvement. It's up to me to take care of the details, which may not have played in my favour this season. I still have a lot to learn. I don't set any limits for myself."
 Thanks to their third consecutive title, Young Boys will take part in the second qualifying round of the Champions League next season, held in just a few weeks' time.
 The single-leg match -- two rounds before the group stage -- will be played behind closed doors on August 25-26.
 St Gallen will finish the Swiss season in second place, ahead of Basel and fouth-placed Servette. All three will therefore feature in next season's Europa League qualifiers.
 Ahead of Young Boys, second-tier Grasshopper have won the most Swiss titles with 27, followed by Basel on 20 and Servette on 17.
