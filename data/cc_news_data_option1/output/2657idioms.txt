So, let's say you're in the financial services industry and you said, low price. You can say--look, I'm willing to give you a low price, but when your stock price reaches X, then we're going to go back to the, to the higher price. So, what I'm trying to outline are ways that you can discount in a manner that doesn't devalue your product in the long run.

Palantir Technologies Inc. said it filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for a public stock listing, taking a major step toward a market debut that has been many years in the making.
 The secretive Silicon Valley company, which sells data analysis software used by governments and large companies worldwide, is seeking to go public by the fall, Bloomberg previously reported, though the timing could change.
 Palantir has been weighing a direct listing of its shares on an exchange against an initial public offering, people with knowledge of the deliberations have said.
 The company said in a statement Monday that it had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a “public listing” of its stock, wording that has been used by other companies planning to pursue a direct listing. Such announcements typically specify a company is planning an IPO when that is the case. Palantir may still decide to pursue a traditional IPO to raise capital for the business.

The company told investors this year that it expects to break even in 2020 on revenue of about $1 billion.
 In June, Palantir added three directors including the first woman to serve on its board, former Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Wolfe Schiff.
 Dozens of law enforcement and government agencies around the world use Palantir to compile and search for data on citizens with the intent of combating crime, hunting terrorists and in recent months, tracking the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic has boosted business as companies use its products to help determine how to reopen.
 However, Palantir is highly controversial for the way its tools have been used to compromise privacy and enable surveillance. Its use by police and immigration officials, in particular, has sparked numerous protests.

And while it seems counterintuitive to have a higher price--if you can justify the value, the long run value of your product in this climate--customers are willing to listen why they should pay a higher price, if it can be justified by--it's better for you in the long run.

The U.S. stock market has been churning over the last month, with big daily moves up and down keeping it roughly in place. It’s been a small-scale version of the market’s movements since the start of the year, when a nearly 34% plunge on worries about the pandemic-caused recession quickly gave way to a tremendous rally that brought the S&P 500 nearly back to its record level.
 Pulling markets higher on one end are reports showing budding improvements in the economy. The job market, retail sales and other economic indicators are all still well below where they were before the pandemic struck. But they’ve stopped plummeting and have begun to grow again as governments relax restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
 That’s combined with unprecedented amounts of aid from central banks and governments around the world to prop up markets. It also helped send the S&P 500 up 1.6% on Monday, following up on a 4% rise the prior week, which itself helped cap the best decade for the index since 1998.
 But pulling markets lower on the other end are worries that the optimism is overdone. The pandemic isn’t going away, with infection levels worsening across wide swaths of the U.S. South and West, among other global hot spots. The concern is that could keep households and businesses nervous and scare them away from spending. In the worst-case scenario, it could force governments to bring back some of the restrictions that sent the economy into its sudden recession.

Istituzioni e sindacato a tutti i livelli si stringono in difesa dello stabilimento, visto che erano presenti al presidio anche il segretario della Cgil dell'Umbria, Vincenzo Sgalla, e quello della Camera del lavoro di Terni, Claudio Cipolla. «Siamo stati in visita insieme al sindaco e non c'è stato un dirigente che ci abbia accolto - ha spiegato Sgalla -. Questo è sintomatico della situazione e mette a rischio la sicurezza delle persone e l'ambiente della fabbrica. La Regione dell'Umbria farebbe bene a convocare subito i dirigenti di questa azienda per chiarire immediatamente qual è la loro necessità. A differenza delle altre aziende in crisi, a Terni e in Umbria, c'è mercato, produzione e valore aggiunto. Non si capisce perché dobbiamo perdere posti di lavoro». Presenti al sit-in anche il segretario nazionale Ugl chimici, Luigi Ulgiati, insieme ad Enzo Valente, anche lui della segreteria nazionale. «Siamo molto preoccupati - hanno detto i due - non riusciamo a capire la strategia dell'azienda, sempre più sfuggente. La situazione è critica, ma ci aspettiamo garanzie occupazionali e strategiche per evitare di perdere un sito produttivo di eccellenza. Risolleciteremo il ministro dello sviluppo economico Stefano Patuanelli - hanno aggiunto -, perché ci auguriamo che a breve arrivi una convocazione del tavolo ministeriale». Convocazione che potrebbe arrivare entro la fine della settimana. In attesa dell'ufficialità dell'incontro, lo sciopero proseguirà anche nella giornata di mercoledì, senza comunque compromettere, come nei giorni precedenti, la produzione. Anche la Regione ha sollecitato intanto l'azienda a dare una risposta chiara, a stretto giro, in merito alla disponibilità espressa ad intervenire con gli strumenti a propria disposizione, a partire dall'area di crisi complessa.

As many businesses continue to operate in crisis mode - their leaders are making a lot of tactical choices to, well, just stay in business. From day-to- day decisions to long-term strategic ones, the goal is to keep your organization afloat now and claim market share of the demand that does return when the crisis is over. And a key aspect of all of this, actually - is setting prices.
