"That first night when I got here, I was extremely excited about the possibility of finding love, but also very nervous and scared, because I didn't know if finding true love was possible," Tayshia admitted. "When I first met you, I thought to myself, 'He's different, and that man is kind. He shows gratitude, and has the biggest smile. He has been through a lot, but has never given up. But also has learned how to read me better than really anyone ever has, and knows how to comfort me when I'm down.' There was one point in my life when I thought I would never get married, because of all the pain and the heartbreak I had been through, and I hit absolute rock bottom. And I know that I told you that I love you, but... it's more than that."

In the wake of the situation, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on December 21 that "2020 is not done with us yet". Speaking from Canberra, Morrison called the recent events in the country "incredibly frustrating and disappointing" for people across the nation who were looking forward to get- togethers and inter-state travel. According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, Australia has a total of 28,237 cases with 908 fatalities.

Frustration with new restrictions was understandable, Pearson said. The objective of the LN site was to provide people with illustrations of the risk factors.
 “We really want a list of basic principles to get across to people,” Pearson said. “It is really a short list. Masks, distancing and hygiene, avoiding indoor gatherings and isolating if you had a positive test or exposure or had any symptoms.”
 Transmission without symptoms, Pearson said, was the reason safety measures had to be maintained. It was also hard for some people to understand.
 “Having symptoms is not what makes you contagious,” Pearson said. “You can be infected and infectious without having symptoms. That can be really confusing.”
 The White House Coronavirus Task Force was pushing for more testing, Pearson said. But she conceded testing people without symptoms was still a long way off.
 Pearson described the recent spike in COVID-19 cases confirmed among federal prison inmates in Union County as unfortunate. There have been other outbreaks in the past but the current one is larger.
 “It seems pretty clearly to be following Thanksgiving,” Pearson said. “(Inmates) were not gathering for Thanksgiving.”
 Pearson said no one is saying prison employees knowingly infected inmates, but she maintained that the employees were in the demographic the White House Coronavirus Task Force said could likely be asymptomatic.
 “A lot of people want to do the right thing and are trying to do the right thing. They are just not clear on what that is,” Pearson concluded. “They got the idea with the masks, but they don’t get the idea that family members that they don’t live with are people they need to wear masks around.”
 Pearson noted a recent River Town Team meeting was held outdoors, around a fire pit and at safe distance.

Hong Kong's High Court granted Jimmy Lai  HK$10 million  (US$1.3 million, €1.06 million) bail on Wednesday and placed him under house arrest.
 The pro-democracy activist was remanded in custody three weeks ago over fraud and national security-related charges and for breaching the lease terms for the office space for one of his media companies.
 Lai, 73, appeared in court on Wednesday after being kept behind bars since December 3.
 Under his bail terms, Lai is not allowed to meet with foreign officials, give any interviews, publish any articles or post on social media. He will have to stay at home and renounce his travel documents.
 ## Allegations of colluding with foreign forces
 The media mogul was arrested in August when about 200 police officers raided the newsroom of his _Apple Daily_ tabloid.
 On December 12, Lai was  charged again under the controversial new national security law  on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security.
 Lai, a frequent visitor to Washington, has met with US officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to garner support for Hong Kong democracy.
 Beijing imposed the national security law in June 2019 in response to the Hong Kong protests over a proposed extradition law. The bill outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city's internal affairs.
 The legislation has been condemned by human rights groups as a tactic to quell dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory but Beijing and Hong Kong authorities say the law is necessary to safeguard national security defences.

And while Flint’s political tug of war with a majority-white state government isn’t unique, that dynamic gave an extra sting to the city’s repeated financial takeovers by state-appointed emergency managers, culminating in the austerity-driven call to switch its water supply to the contaminated Flint River.

When the Princess Theater opened on Oct. 29, 1914, a newspaper article said it was “taxed to capacity” with the public anxious to get a glimpse of the interior of the new building. Special consideration had been given to the ventilation system to keep the “air pure at all times.” The seating was arranged to allow for a “perfect view of the stage” from any seat in the house.
 To accommodate patrons who rode the Berlin Street Railway to the theater, two electric lamps were installed in front of the stage. One had the words “Car for Berlin Mills” while the other said “Car for Gorham.” When a trolley reached the square, one of the lamps came on — indicating which way the car was headed so passengers could leave in time to catch it.
 The city already had two other theaters in the downtown when the Princess Theater opened. The four-story Albert Theater was built at 198 Main St. in 1905 with an auditorium that seated 1,400 people, a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and a grand piano. The Gem opened on Main Street in 1909, with a 700-person capacity.
 By 1916, the three theaters were owned by Edward Gilbert, under the business name Allied Theaters of Berlin.
 The Gem closed as a theater in 1923 and the Albert Theater closed in 1955. The Gem eventually became a jewelry store and was destroyed in the 1990s fire that took out four downtown buildings. The Albert Theater became a department store and has since been renovated by Paul and Fran Cusson, in hopes of attracting a new business there.
 The Princess Theater has had a variety of owners during its history and closed and reopened several times.
 It ran from 1914 until the doors were closed in July 1943. The theater remained closed for 14 years until it was purchased in 1957 by John Voudoukis, according to research by the late Berlin Sun historian Poof Tardiff.
 Voudoukis renovated and remodeled the theater, putting in the latest stereophonic sound equipment and a curved Cinemascope screen. The building was air-conditioned and had a recreation room downstairs, where a color television set was installed.
 A grand reopening ceremony was held on May 2, 1957, “to present to Northern New Englanders the new look in motion picture entertainment.”

Grace enjoyed being with family and took pride in her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was a caregiver by heart; earlier on it was nothing for her to run a family member or neighbor to appointments or stop to check in on them daily on her way to or from work. In her younger days, she could run circles around anyone and get more accomplished in one day than most people in a week. If you stopped at her house, she always made you feel comfortable and offered you a cup of coffee and something to eat.
 Baking and cooking came naturally to her and she was very creative with it. It was nothing to see her come up with a huge meal in a matter of minutes, with a dessert included. On the farm, not a day was missed where there wasn't something fresh out of the oven, whether it was before she went to work at Farm & Fleet or after milking was done in the evening.
 For anybody who got to be her “Noodle Tester,” it was the best job in the world! Gracie’s Chicken and Noodles, her signature dish, will live on to be enjoyed by those she has taught how to make it, and just remember don’t forget the secret ingredient – a cup of vinegar.

Read: The fight to make meaning out of a massacre
 He may have lost half of the room already, because a divided nation can’t agree even on the most basic question of what it means to adequately collect data. Our conversation was postponed for a week because hours before our originally scheduled call, 17 Republican state attorneys general had filed a brief in support of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s unsuccessful attempt to delay the certification of presidential electors in Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If it is this difficult to agree on as simple a question as who won an election, how can you possibly agree on the importance of something as complex as a solution to hate crimes? I asked.
 “We’re in a hurricane,” he said. Just as it would be foolish to try to fly a kite or sail during a storm, it would be foolish to rush this initiative. “We think this is the time,” he said, before clarifying, “maybe not, for example, between now and the Georgia election.”
 Though he seemed to know that I might be wary of the answer in such a polarized American moment, he told me that the initiative’s success was about waging a “hearts and minds” campaign; it is not going to be a quick fix. When the government can finally collect better data, he believes people will “begin to understand the full scale, scope, and duration of the problem and all of its enduring consequences.” Although those who perpetrate hate crimes ought to be arrested and prosecuted, he said, the nation must understand that these are not all isolated incidents.
