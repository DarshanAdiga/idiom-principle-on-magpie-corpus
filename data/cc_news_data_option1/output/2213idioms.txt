Constipation often occurs when the waste in the bowel moves too slowly. This gives the stool time to become hard and dry, which makes it harder to pass and causes severe abdominal pain. Baking soda has been used as an antacid for decades. Regularly drinking it with water can neutralize your stomach acid and can even prove to be a remedy for heartburn and indigestion. There are various laxative tablets available to treat this stomach ailment. However, its regular usage can make the situation worse in the long run.

According to the police department, a scene commander warned protesters at 11th Avenue and East Pine Street to stop pushing barriers, and then some people "began throwing bottles, rocks and incendiary devices" at officers. A photo provided by the police department of the devices thrown showed what appeared to be a candle.
 Across town at about the same time, Kevin Norris, 29, was sitting on the ground at Magnuson Park. The human-resource manager and Bremerton resident remembered reeling from the 2017 death of Charleena Lyles in Seattle. He hadn’t joined other rallies commemorating the mother’s death, but felt spurred to join Saturday night's gathering after a week of global protests over Floyd’s death.
 “We have incidents here in our own state that go unnoticed,” said Norris. “This was one story that had a five-minute news flash.”
 As a Black man, Norris feels it’s time for change. He wanted to highlight the killing of Lyles, a 30-year-old Black woman, because, he said, Black women also are targets of police brutality and their “names often get lost” in the news cycle.
 At the time of Lyles' death, police said she had one or two knives when the officers, who were white, arrived. They shot her seven times. The shooting drew community outrage and questions about why officers did not use less-than- lethal means to respond and whether they had appropriate crisis-intervention training.
 At the park, some wore black and carried signs that read “Defund SPD,” and “No more silence, we need justice.” Some marched toward University Village, where entrances were blocked. On Monday, some protesters smashed supermarket windows there and on Saturday, many stores were boarded up.
 Saturday's events drew regular activists and first-time protesters who were determined that the killing of Floyd, whose last moments were with his neck under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, now propel the nation in a new direction.
 In a video broadcast, Black Lives Matter Seattle - King County called for a statewide general strike and silent march on Friday.
 “We’re calling on everyone in Washington state who is able to be there. If you can’t march in Seattle, organize one in your community,” board member Ebony Miranda said in a video news conference, asking people to participate despite the COVID-19 crisis.
 “Anti-blackness is a greater threat to our survival, and racism in itself is its own pandemic. It’s killing us. We’re fighting to survive and thrive.”
 The group said it had met Saturday with Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan to discuss police-reform demands, including its call for cutting the police budget by $100 million.
 The chaos and violence on Capitol Hill came after thousands had made their way to the area near the East Precinct. Several groups offered free food from Seattle restaurants, as well as medical items and art supplies to make signs. But the tensions clearly built as police and protesters had little space separating them.

(Gray News) - The U.S. Marine Corps has banned the Confederate battle flag from public display on its bases in light of its divisive nature and use by racist groups.In guidance released Friday, the Marine Corps said the Confederate battle flag should be removed from workplaces, common-access and public areas in order to “support our core values, ensure unit cohesion and security, and preserve good order and discipline.”Among other items, the order applies to car bumper stickers, clothing, mugs and posters depicting the flag that may be on bases.“The Confederate battle flag has all too often been co-opted by violent extremist and racist groups whose divisive beliefs have no place in our Corps,” said social media posts releasing the new guidance.The guidance follows an April 2020 statement in which Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps, said the Confederate flag should be removed from public displays on bases.“I am mindful that many people believe that flag to be a symbol of heritage or regional pride. But I am also mindful of the feelings of pain and rejection of those who inherited the cultural memory and present effects of the scourge of slavery in our country,” wrote Berger in the statement. “This symbol has shown it has the power to inflame feelings of division. I cannot have that division inside our Corps.”The guidance for removal does not apply to installations that address the Civil War from a historical or educational perspective nor works of art where the Confederate flag is present but not the main focus. It also does not apply to Confederate soldiers’ grave sites.Confederate symbols have recently been coming down in the South amid protests over George Floyd’s death on May 25 at the hands of police in Minneapolis.The Marine Corps addressed these current events in a June 3 message from Berger that encouraged conversations and active listening between commanders and their Marines and Sailors.“Only as a unified force, free from discrimination, racial inequality, and prejudice can we fully demonstrate our core values, and serve as the elite warfighting organization America requires and expects us to be,” wrote Berger in the statement.Copyright 2020 Gray Media Group, Inc.

Aug. 15, 1946 - May 30, 2020Lifelong Fairbanksan Lawrence "Larry" Robert Ostnes, passed away in an accident on May 30, 2020, while enjoying the great state he loved.Larry was born to Leif R. Ostnes and Meredith (Toy) Andrews at St. Joseph's Hospital on Aug. 15, 1946. He graduated in 1965 from Lathrop High School. He met his forever sweetheart Janice Birklid in the third grade, as she was the younger sister of his childhood buddy Gary. They began dating shortly after high school. After a brief summer romance, and a delay by the Great Flood of 1967, they were married that fall on Oct. 28. He spent the rest of his life courting her and they were constantly by each other's side. Larry was bit by the mining bug at an early age. He spent his childhood summers in Flat mining with his grandparents, Lars and Elise Ostnes, continued mining in his adulthood, and he later looked forward to spending his summers at the family mining camp. After retirement, he, along with his beloved sweetheart, became reverse snowbirds and lived in Fairbanks during the winters so he could spend summers along the riverbanks of the family mine - their favorite place. He was always amazed by the beauty of Alaska and the adventures it provided. After his initiation in Nov. 1966, Larry spent his working career as a proud member of the Local 302, retiring in November 2001. He was involved in highway and road construction projects across Alaska, and was a master Operator of all Heavy Equipment. His meticulous snow removal skills are legendary. He served in the Army National Guard after high school. Larry was also a member of Fairbanks Lutheran Church, the Pioneers of Alaska and the Elks Lodge.As he aged, though not necessarily matured, his beautiful white hair made him easy to find in a crowd. The quick-witted, charming silver fox, was a maker of magic moments. For example, he convinced his grandkids that his birch tree was a special hybrid which allowed them to pick the most beautifully polished apples year round. He showed his love for his kids and grandkids by spending countless hours building snow forts, holding tea parties, untangling necklaces, throwing baseballs, and attending concerts, curling and many other sporting events, even when it involved travel across the country. His great nieces and nephews referred to him as "Funny Larry." Ever the athlete, he enjoyed downhill and cross-country skiing, hiking, and sports in the backyard with family and friends. Making others happy made Larry happy. Always the host, he enjoyed sharing the beauty of remote Alaska with friends and family and even with those passing by. He didn't hesitate to lend a hand, even when it meant firing up the dozer to provide safe river crossings for those traveling through. "Piece of cake," he would say. Larry was preceded in death by his parents, step-father Gilbert Andrews, his favorite in-laws Naimy Birklid and Bill Birklid and brothers-in-law Jack Birklid, Gary Birklid and Bob Ramsey. He is survived by his loving wife of 52 years, Janice Ostnes; children, Lori (Ty) Schommer, Lance Ostnes, Nels "Jason" (Jennifer) Ostnes; grandchildren, Naimy (Levi) Weis, Alhrik, Gannon and Adeline Schommer, Lucy, Kiersten and Bode Ostnes; siblings, Dianne Ramsey, Carol (Ted) Murphy, and Jeanne (Tim) Benintendi; siblings-in law Bill (Bev) Birklid, Denny Birklid, Marceile (Stubby Shefchik) Birklid, Ron (Cathy) Birklid; and many loving nieces and nephews, and great-nieces and -nephews and numerous "cousins" and friends in Alaska and throughout the U.S.Due to current restrictions of COVID-19, a private, family invitation only funeral service will be held at Fairbanks Lutheran Church on June 18 at 2 p.m. The family requests that you join them for the live-streamed service - fairbankslutheranchurch.org - follow the online worship service links.In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in Larry's memory to the Fairbanks Curling Club Junior Curling Program, 1962 Seond Ave., Fairbanks, AK 99701, or Fairbanks Lutheran Church Building Fund, 1012 Cowles St., Fairbanks, AK 99701.Larry's wife and family would like to thank family, friends and the Fairbanks community for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time. Arrangements were made by Chapel of Chimes Funeral Home.

Ashland rancher Mark Gardiner is convinced the Idaho organization responsible for implementing a conservation program for the lesser prairie chicken in Kansas and four other states engaged in mismanagement that failed the colorful bird while squandering millions of dollars and valuable years of opportunity.
   
 Gardiner, who works with the family's prominent Angus herd and 40,000-acre operation in southwest Kansas amid prime grassland for the prairie chicken, said that conclusion was backed by an independent audit of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, headquartered in Boise, Idaho. The audit faulted WAFWA for fumbling voluntary investment by industry groups and participation of landowners since 2013 in a campaign to expand quality habitat for the dancing bird struggling to maintain footholds on the prairie, he said.
   
 The robust analysis revealed WAFWA abused a portion of $30 million set aside by private investors for chicken habitat in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. The organization fell short in serving interests of energy, farming and livestock producers eager to coexist with the prairie chicken and prevent it from returning to the federal threatened species list, the audit said.
   
 "They spent a lot of money, but didn't solve the problem. This did not work. That was a missed opportunity," Gardiner said. "It was really squandering the money and not being a solution. Free enterprise and competition works and they did it to protect their own existence."
   
 Performance of the conservation initiative could be a factor in an upcoming decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding proposals to re- establish federal regulatory protection of the lesser prairie chicken. The agency is expected to announce its findings in May 2021, with businesses and environmentalists in a tug-of-war over the future of government intervention.
   
 U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said flaws in the program were real, but the lesser prairie chicken population had grown 121% since the peak of a drought in 2013. There were an estimated 17,000 birds in 2013 and about 38,000 in 2018.
   
 He said the population expanded due to greater rainfall and on-the-ground conservation measures, not intervention available under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
   
 "While the voluntary initiatives currently in effect can and should be improved," Moran said, "I believe based on the available evidence that voluntary, locally driven solutions continue to offer the best path forward to conserving the lesser prairie chicken."
   
 Brutal audit
   
 The audit prepared by Ben Guillon, an expert on mitigation markets, for the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies showed the organization failed to properly manage the conservation program, wasted funding to buy a $650,000 headquarters building in Idaho and improperly transferred money from the conservation endowment to fund administrative costs.
   
 A copy of the July 2019 audit said WAFWA had "an organizational culture that prevents an effective management of the program," "does not track its liabilities properly and may not have enough assets to cover its future potential liabilities," "program spending on temporary mitigation is unsustainable," "does not properly administer the program from a financial standpoint" and fell short of providing "a net gain in conservation" objectives.
   
 From $5 million to $7 million earmarked to reimburse landowners who engaged in conservation activities on their property was "improperly" used by WAFWA for employees' salaries and other administrative costs, the audit said. An underlying conclusion of the audit was that nearly half the $65 million available to WAFWA for the lesser prairie chicken hadn't been effectively invested.
   
 The auditor offered four options: terminate the program without replacement, freeze the current program to block enrollment of additional land and investment, immediately transfer the program to a third party and restructure the program to restore financial sustainability, ecological integrity and professional execution.
   
 Chris Moore, executive director of WAFWA, reported the audit identified structural and financial management issues the organization had to address. The association is a consortium of 24 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with only one-fifth harboring prairie chickens.
   
 "Based on the audit's recommendations," Moore said, "WAFWA immediately took several actions to improve its short-term financial situation and organizational structure. WAFWA continues to implement new procedures and approaches to address the recommendations of the audit."
   
 Noah Greenwald, endangered species director with the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz., said viability of the lesser prairie chicken was undermined by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by oil and gas development, cropland conversion, livestock grazing and construction of roads and power lines.
   
 "The audit's conclusions make clear WAFWA grossly mismanaged efforts to save the lesser prairie chicken from extinction," Greenwald said. "Given these revelations, there's no question these magnificent dancing birds need the Endangered Species Act's protections to have any hope of survival."
   
 He said a robust regulatory framework enforced by the federal government would ensure prairie chicken conservation was prioritized.
   
 Other reaction
   
 The lesser prairie chicken was listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as threatened from 2014 to 2016. A Texas judge invalidated protections for the bird in response to a lawsuit alleging the federal agency rushed the listing process.
   
 It has remained off that list under pressure from business and political interests based, in part, on the promise of WAFWA making progress to expand population of the shy bird.
   
 WAFWA's central strategy was to pay landowners to set aside prairie chicken habitat and allow other conservation activities using mitigation fees paid mostly by energy companies, who make the payments to offset habitat impact of their commercial activities. These investments are a way for companies to shield operation of oil or gas wells, wind turbines or transmission lines if the federal government took steps to protect the species.
   
 Adam Riggsbee, president of RiverBank Conservation in Austin, Texas, said the audit disclosed major problems that could be manipulated by environmentalists in prairie chicken litigation. RiverBank manages conservation banks used to offset development in areas populated by endangered species.
   
 He said WAFWA accepted millions of dollars from private companies for prairie chicken habitat, but made decisions that made it impossible to meet responsibilities to those contributors.
   
 Brad Loveless, secretary of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, said businesses made a good-faith effort to support what was to have been a self-sustaining habitat development program led by WAWFA. The organization clearly weakened its position with the prairie chicken by shifting conservation money to general operations, he said.
   
 He said bad decisions undercut the objective of locking down tracts of land in easements to expand prairie chicken strongholds, many of which remain in southwest Kansas.
   
 "If we're going to hope to help this species, we need to preserve those areas. Not let them get broken up by development," Loveless said.
   
 Administrative struggles at WAFWA will intensify debate about the comparative value of voluntary measures versus federal mandates regarding the prairie chicken, he said.
   
 "In the business world, which is my background, you want certainty so you know how to make good business decisions going forward. Uncertainty is the enemy," he said.
   
 He said the WAFWA intervention program created for the lesser prairie chicken could be salvaged.
   
 "For the sake of the bird, we have to," Loveless said. "This is an important critter for us. The bird is depending on us to look out for it. Not that it's going to be easy. It's going to take some more money. It's going to take some tough management decisions."

But Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said on Saturday night that those talks now hung "by a thread".
 "Balpa reps have been in consultation with BA over its proposed 1,130 pilot job losses and we've been doing that constructively and in good faith," Mr Strutton said in a statement.
 "Then, on Wednesday evening, a letter from BA added another 125 job losses and also for the first time threatened all 4,300 BA pilots with dismissal and reengagement if we did not reach agreement on changes to terms and conditions.
 "I'm appalled at the cavalier attitude shown by BA towards the Balpa reps and to its pilots.
 "This has seriously undermined our talks which now hang by a thread."
 Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA's parent company IAG, emphasized this week in a letter to Parliament that no decision had been made in relation to actual redundancies.
 "There are some who believe the company is exaggerating the scale of the challenge," Mr Walsh said in the letter. "Nothing could be further from the truth. The situation is unprecedented."
 ## Quarantine row
 British Airways said it was acting now to protect as many jobs possible, as the airline industry faced the deepest structural change in its history. It called on Unite and the GMB to consult with it on its proposals as Balpa was doing.
 Separately, BA, Easyjet and Ryanair have made inroads towards a legal challenge to the government's plan to impose two weeks' quarantine on international travellers.
 The three have written a letter to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official.
 In it, they argue the incoming travellers will be more stringent than those for people who actually diagnosed as having coronavirus - and point out that the rules will not apply for residents of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
 The proposals have been roundly criticised across the travel industry. The Home Office has said it believes the measures will help stop the spread of the virus.
 The BBC has requested comment from the Home Office.

Looking for the best new TV under £1,000? This one is so new that it's not quite out yet. The 4K HDR Philips 7334 LED television (or 55PUS7334/12 to give it its full title) was set for release by now but has been delayed just a smidge. We liked it so much that we are still crowning it Best TV under £1,000 in the _2019 T3 Awards_ _._
   * Best TV not under £1,000
 While there are a lot of fantastic TVs around the £1000 mark, some cut corners in one or two areas in order to force the price down. The Philips' 7334, by contrast (and it has _excellent_ contrast), really is the complete package.
 The styling is contemporary and chic, and looks and feels premium. Image quality is excellent, with picture modes to suit all tastes, from ultra vivid (perhaps a bit excessively so, if anything) to tastefully cinematic. Motion is well handled and there's support for HDR including Dolby Vision. Native 4K and upscaled HD looks excellent, but it _really_ flies with Dolby Vision fodder from Amazon Prime or Netflix. The built-in speakers are surprisingly good, and the 7334 thunderously outputs Dolby Atmos to compatible speakers and soundbars.
 Completing the package, there's Philips' unique Ambilight. This picks on- screen colours and repeats them using LED lights arrayed along the top and sides of the TV. This bathes the wall behind the 7334 with coloured light in ways that can be subtle and soothing, or energising. It's almost entirely unnecessary, but it does add a certain something to the experience. If you have colour Philips Hue bulbs, you can even extend this complimentary colour effect to those, as well.
 All the key catch-up and streaming apps can be accessed via the Android TV OS and there's inputs for both aerial and satellite. Google Assistant and voice control of the TV is built in, and Alexa can be used via your Amazon Echo device. It's a lot of TV for your money.

Weekly column, No. 2,000-something, Take 2.
   
 It's Saturday morning, and I have just killed the column I wrote earlier this week.
   
 This past Tuesday, I went to the state fairgrounds and took the coronavirus test. A long swab, two twists up the nose and a brain tickle and it was over.
   
 So I decided to write a clever, funny column about the tests, about wearing colorful masks and so forth. Lamont Cranston was going to be joining me in the frivolity.
   
 Ha-ha. Funny.
   
 But Friday night, I had second, third, fourth -- you get the idea -- thoughts about that. And I realized such a column was disingenuous, because taking the test -- at least for me -- was a big deal, and the 48-hour wait for the results had my little obsessive brain spinning.
   
 It occurred to me that this had the potential of being one of those crossroads in life, like when the doctor sees something in the X-ray, or when you get the call that the doctor needs to talk to you about your blood work, or when the boss calls you in and starts lamenting the difficult decisions he has to make.
   
 ]I don' know if I'm a true obsessive-compulsive disorder type, but I do obsess over things. For example, I'm looking at getting a different car, one that isnt' sold in Pueblo, so I've studied the websites of dealers from her to California, looking at inventories, comparing models and prices. Over and over again. Daily. For weeks now.
   
 So when I took the test, the period after before I got THE phone call wasn't a laughing matter.
   
 Like you, I've watched the horrible images of people on ventilators, especially older people. I am in that demographic group. I might not see myself that way, but a 66th birthday looms a few days away, so the facts are the facts.
   
 I don't have too many underlying conditions. Don't smoke or drink; exercise regularly. I have migraines and a mild heart issue with hypertension, although a close friend commented that I need not worry about the heart issues since I lived the first 45 years of my life and didn't even have a heart.
   
 Nothing like a good friend to tell the truth.
   
 So after the brain tickle, I started thinking, "What if I get it? What if I get hospitalized? What if I have to be intubated and put on a ventilator and don't get to have that last conversation with my loved ones?"
   
 We've seen that play out all over the country many, many times. Doctors and nurses tell the horrible stories of them being the ones to hold patients' hands when they die.
   
 It's not the death part that scares me. Finding my faith some 15 years ago has given me hope. It's slim, I'll grant you, but some hope.
   
 But the rest of it? Well, I realized I don't want to check out yet.
   
 I want to see the grandkids grow up and graduate from high school and college. I never thought such a thing would be such a driving force in my life, but every grandparent knows how powerful that desire is.
   
 I want to continue writing and editing for this newspaper. Our efforts the past few months to bring you comprehensive information about the pandemic has reinvigorated me, establishing again how important a local newspaper is to a community. Other media just can't provide the details and sheer volume of coverage that we can.
   
 So I waited for the phone call and, yeah, I was scared. I didn't tell anybody that, nor describe the dark feeling that the test might be positive. Everyone who's close to me knows I have a regrettable pessimistic, dark side, so it went without saying that I was considering that the phone call might be bad news.
   
 Well, the call came and I was negative for the coronavirus. It was a great relief. And, I realized Friday night and Saturday morning, nothing to joke about.
   
 I am grateful to you for reading this today, and for reading The Pueblo Chieftain. This is a tough time for many businesses, and ours is no different as advertising has dropped because, obviously, many businesses have been closed for two months.
   
 Hopefully that changes in the weeks and months ahead.
   
 In the meantime, your support is appreciated.
   
 Thank you. And be safe.
   
 And if I may, WEAR A DAMN MASK TO THE STORES. if you don't, there's a chance that you might infect someone, maybe even kill someone.
   
 This isn't an issue of freedom or constitutional rights. This is caring about your fellow citizens.
   
 If you don't wear a mask, you are being selfish and hiding behind the flimsy argument that your personal rights are being violated. You get to drive a car, too, but you don' get to drive it 100 mph through a school zone.
   
 So please. I know the things are uncomfortable. But this isn't a cause. The earlier conflicting statements about the value of wearing a mask have gone away. Our nation's top medical experts say wearing a mask is effective.
   
 So please, think of others. We're Americans. We're in this together. It's a small ask, and wearing a mask shows you care.
   
 P.S. I'm out this week. We'll visit again on June 21.
   
 God willing.

Aug. 15, 1946 - May 30, 2020   Lifelong Fairbanksan Lawrence "Larry" Robert Ostnes, passed away in an accident on May 30, 2020, while enjoying the great state he loved.   Larry was born to Leif R. Ostnes and Meredith (Toy) Andrews at St. Joseph's Hospital on Aug. 15, 1946. He graduated in 1965 from Lathrop High School.   He met his forever sweetheart Janice Birklid in the third grade, as she was the younger sister of his childhood buddy Gary. They began dating shortly after high school. After a brief summer romance, and a delay by the Great Flood of 1967, they were married that fall on Oct. 28. He spent the rest of his life courting her and they were constantly by each other's side.   Larry was bit by the mining bug at an early age. He spent his childhood summers in Flat mining with his grandparents, Lars and Elise Ostnes, continued mining in his adulthood, and he later looked forward to spending his summers at the family mining camp. After retirement, he, along with his beloved sweetheart, became reverse snowbirds and lived in Fairbanks during the winters so he could spend summers along the riverbanks of the family mine - their favorite place. He was always amazed by the beauty of Alaska and the adventures it provided.   After his initiation in Nov. 1966, Larry spent his working career as a proud member of the Local 302, retiring in November 2001. He was involved in highway and road construction projects across Alaska, and was a master Operator of all Heavy Equipment. His meticulous snow removal skills are legendary. He served in the Army National Guard after high school. Larry was also a member of Fairbanks Lutheran Church, the Pioneers of Alaska and the Elks Lodge.   As he aged, though not necessarily matured, his beautiful white hair made him easy to find in a crowd. The quick-witted, charming silver fox, was a maker of magic moments. For example, he convinced his grandkids that his birch tree was a special hybrid which allowed them to pick the most beautifully polished apples year round. He showed his love for his kids and grandkids by spending countless hours building snow forts, holding tea parties, untangling necklaces, throwing baseballs, and attending concerts, curling and many other sporting events, even when it involved travel across the country. His great nieces and nephews referred to him as "Funny Larry." Ever the athlete, he enjoyed downhill and cross-country skiing, hiking, and sports in the backyard with family and friends.   Making others happy made Larry happy. Always the host, he enjoyed sharing the beauty of remote Alaska with friends and family and even with those passing by. He didn't hesitate to lend a hand, even when it meant firing up the dozer to provide safe river crossings for those traveling through. "Piece of cake," he would say.   Larry was preceded in death by his parents, step-father Gilbert Andrews, his favorite in-laws Naimy Birklid and Bill Birklid and brothers-in-law Jack Birklid, Gary Birklid and Bob Ramsey. He is survived by his loving wife of 52 years, Janice Ostnes; children, Lori (Ty) Schommer, Lance Ostnes, Nels "Jason" (Jennifer) Ostnes; grandchildren, Naimy (Levi) Weis, Alhrik, Gannon and Adeline Schommer, Lucy, Kiersten and Bode Ostnes; siblings, Dianne Ramsey, Carol (Ted) Murphy, and Jeanne (Tim) Benintendi; siblings-in law Bill (Bev) Birklid, Denny Birklid, Marceile (Stubby Shefchik) Birklid, Ron (Cathy) Birklid; and many loving nieces and nephews, and great-nieces and -nephews and numerous "cousins" and friends in Alaska and throughout the U.S.   Due to current restrictions of COVID-19, a private, family invitation only funeral service will be held at Fairbanks Lutheran Church on June 18 at 2 p.m. The family requests that you join them for the live-streamed service - fairbankslutheranchurch.org \- follow the online worship service links.   In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in Larry's memory to the Fairbanks Curling Club Junior Curling Program, 1962 Seond Ave., Fairbanks, AK 99701, or Fairbanks Lutheran Church Building Fund, 1012 Cowles St., Fairbanks, AK 99701.   Larry's wife and family would like to thank family, friends and the Fairbanks community for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time.   Arrangements were made by Chapel of Chimes Funeral Home.

The nine boxers, who have qualified for the Tokyo Games are Amit Panghal (52kg), Manish Kaushik (63kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), M C Mary Kom (51kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), and Pooja Rani (75kg). The men traditionally train in Patiala, while the women's camp is based in Delhi. The decision to combine the two in Patiala from June 10 was taken on May 23 after a video conference between top BFI officials, the boxers and national coaches. "There are logistics that need to be worked out. The boxers have to be brought to Patiala, they have to be tested as well. All these things will need at least a week, so let's see, we are hopeful of things moving ahead in the second half of the month," Sacheti said. Sporting activities in the country were halted after the imposition of a lockdown to contain the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in March. However, the home ministry allowed opening of sports complexes and stadia, without spectators, in relaxations announced last month. But state governments have the final authority on the matter depending on the COVID-19 situation. All the boxers have been training at their respective homes ever since the nationals camps came to a halt in mid-March owing to the virus outbreak, which has caused more than 6,000 deaths in India and wreaked havoc globally. In the SAI's Standard Operating Procedure for resumption of training, boxers have been barred from doing human sparring and told not to access the ring for the time being. They have also been instructed to use their personal equipment for all forms of training as part of the safety protocol to negate the threat of the virus. In addition, they have also been offered cover for COVID-19 in their medical insurance, as per the SOP made by the BFI. The boxers and the federation will have to sign consent forms acknowledging the risk of resumption before being allowed back at the SAI centre. The federation remains optimistic of conducting its national events in the usual window of October-November and has also bagged the hosting rights of the Asian Championships, tentatively planned for December. So far, track-and- field athletes and hockey players are the only ones to have officially resumed training.",

 Each spring, the acequias in New Mexico carry cold, clear snowmelt to freshly furrowed fields on small farms.
 The centuries-old irrigation culture is recognized in state law and supported by strong communities.
 These farms often come to mind when we think about agriculture in the West: a cool riparian valley with adjacent fields and people rooted in the land, growing crops that may be sold at a farmer's market in a nearby town.
 So when former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt suggested in a recent opinion piece (Writersontherange.org), that a portion of agricultural water rights should be transferred to urban areas, it no doubt conjured up some strong emotions -- small family farms drying up so that suburbanites could water their lawns and golf courses.
 But Babbitt's proposal makes sense, and he is right about the need to recognize the mismatch in population in the Colorado River Basin between the urbanized West and rural areas where most of the basin's water is allocated.
 He is also right that the Colorado River cannot continue serving 40 million people, irrigating the same acreage, and meeting our aspirations for healthy -rivers, in this time of megadrought.
 There are a lot of caveats to his idea of people voluntarily retiring irrigation rights, including the need to create a process that allows full public participation. But unless we begin to retire irrigated acreage with a carefully managed strategy, we will have showdowns among states and tribes that share the basin's water and increasingly desiccated rivers.
 The real obstacle to Babbitt's proposal springs from our romanticized vision of what agriculture looks like in the West. New Mexico may have acequia-fed fields, but it's also in the nation's top 10 for the number of dairy cattle, the products of which are largely exported to other states.
 For every rain-fed cornfield sprouting emerald-like in the Arizona desert, there are tens of thousands of acres of alfalfa fields guzzling up millions of gallons of water per year.
 The United States is the world's largest exporter of food, which means that the arid West is, in effect, exporting our water via huge, corporate farms.
 Let's not forget that it is agribusiness -- not small farmers - that's responsible for 80% of the water use in the West.
 Meanwhile, climate change is drying up what water remains. The declining flows and warming temperatures are no longer just a contested forecast about the future, but our lived experience.
 In my own corner of the West I'm astounded by how quickly desertification is occurring, with hard-packed soils where there was vegetation just a few years ago. Those obnoxious dust storms (haboobs) seem to be moving northward, leading me to tell everyone to watch Ken Burn's powerful TV series on the Dust Bowl.
 Ranchers are on the front line in New Mexico, where grazing is looking more and more problematic.
 Of course, water isn't just valuable to farms and cities. The West has a huge outdoor recreation industry that depends on hiking, rafting and fishing, and our riparian areas grant solace in hectic times.
 Declining river flows, dried up springs and parsimonious releases for fishes detract from this sector of a growing economy.
 Babbitt proposes to alleviate this situation by creating a mechanism by which farmers can lease their water rights to municipalities for a set period of time. He proposes free- market transactions -- entirely voluntary and at the full discretion of each operator -- funded by the federal government.
 I suggest that agricultural water also be made available to remain in our rivers for the health of our fragile river ecosystems.
 Of course, there is a danger to a market-driven solution. If there were a federally run market in water rights, one would expect to see low-value agricultural areas to be the first to be approached for water sales.
 That may be why in Europe policies explicitly protect small farms. This could lessen the departure of farmers from parts of northern New Mexico or rural areas on Colorado's Western Slope, and other areas where small farms still exist.
 No one is choosing the drought that has settled into the western United States, along with warming temperatures, wildfires and the rest of our changed climate. We have to cooperate to lessen the effect of climate on individuals and our shared environment.
 That is why Babbitt's proposal deserves a good, full-throated civic discussion. I just hope it is followed by actions to help the lands and people west of the 100 the meridian thrive in the 21 st century.

When the Covid-19 lockdown was clamped in Pune on March 25 along with the rest of the country, one of the establishments that was hit hard was Shreevatsa Child Care Institute which takes care of infant destitutes and abandoned babies.Located inside the premises of the government-run Sassoon General Hospital, Shreevatsa, run by the Society of Friends of Sassoon Hospital (Sofosh), had 46 infants in its custody at the time of the lockdown. Taking care of them became an issue as the lockdown hampered the movement of its 70 caretakers.That is when Shalini Suresh Wadkar a 29-year-old caretaker with Shreevatsa, decided to stay at the itself rather than go home and be away from work. She was among the 25 caretakers who stayed at the child care centre for 15 days at a stretch.Working at Shreevatsa for the last 10 years, Shalini, a mother of three children, began staying at the centre for 15 days and then going home for a week. She received full support from her family while adapting to this new, demanding schedule.However, this was not just a job for Shalini who went out of her way to care for these children.Recently when one of the new born babies had some health issues and needed to be hospitalised, this caretaker voluntarily came forward to stay with the baby in the hospital for 24 hours. "For the next one week she was with that baby in the hospital, just as a mother would have done, till it was cured and discharged. She would give me a daily report about the baby's recovery," said Sharmila Sayed, administration in-charge at Sofosh.About this incident Shalini said it was on May 7 that this baby was admitted to a nearby private hospital and she immediately volunteered to stay with it. "I felt it was unsafe to leave the baby alone at the hospital," she said. On one occasion when she was not allowed to go inside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) because she was not the mother, Shalini insisted that "she was as good as the baby's mother and she wanted to go in like the other mothers who were being allowed inside." Finally, the nurses relented and she was allowed."I just wanted my baby to recover fast and bring it back home to our centre," she said.Upon their return, both she and the baby had to stay in isolation for a week as they had returned from a hospital."During this period I would video-call my children and speak to them," she said.Sayed recalled that a year ago Shalini had given birth to her own baby. When she re-joined duty, she breast-fed not just her own chid but, with permission, also a premature baby at the centre."Hailing from a lower-middle-class family, Shalini is married to an autorickshaw driver who has lost his earnings due to the lockdown. The family is now solely dependent on her income with her husband and parents taking care of her three children when she is away at the child care centre."I have two daughters and a son at home and my family is very supportive of my work. Because of them I am able to stay at the centre and work round the clock for my other children who are at the child care centre. These children need us and we have a different bonding with them. When I am at the centre staying with them, I am completely immersed in my work as this also is my family," she said.

OnePlus 7 Pro is an ambitious, brawny, beautiful flagship that shows what this spunky start-up is capable of when it's not designing a budget-conscious device. The 90Hz Fluid AMOLED is gorgeous, the handset is blink-and-you'll- miss-it fast, and the 30W Warp Charging is unmatched. However, there are other areas where the OnePlus 7 Pro isn't quite on the same level as similarly priced rivals like the Samsung Galaxy S10e and iPhone XR – there's no wireless charging, no expandable storage, no adjustable bokeh blur in Portrait Mode, no IP Rating for water resistance... the list goes on. There's a lot to love here, but the new higher price tag means you'll want to look closely at the competition before you take the plunge.

Cost-to-income (C/I) remained one of the few areas where some progress was seen. After rising throughout 2019, C/I ratio fell by about 1.1 per cent points to reach 34 per cent. C/I ratio declined largely on the back of a 6.8 per cent quarter on quarter decline in operating expenses. Cost-cutting measures adopted by the banks resulted in some improvement as eight of the 10 banks had reduced their operating expenses.

 I have been increasingly alarmed at the supply and manufacturing shortages that continue to mount in Big Box stores and in common chemicals and non- essential supplies like, well, like makeup.
 As a sometimes consumer of makeup (for my girls), I found the empty shelves at Walmart on Saturday particularly annoying. Walmart quit shipping makeup and other fluff two months ago, and now they cannot get it, even if they want it, and they do want it. The manufacturers are not making it and there is no supply chain for it.
 The same is true of most of the mundane items at Home Depot and Lowes. Home Depot in Pueblo did over $230,000 in business last Saturday, $80,000 more than they planned for that shift. They hired five extra people to meet their planned load, and quickly discovered that people want lots of stuff, more than they could imagine.
 But, there's a catch: Fancy saw horses are out of supply or quickly disappearing. So are multiple things I never think about until I find myself staring at the empty shelf or bin and talking to the masked staff who have no idea when or if they'll get any more.
 I have traded email with an enthusiastic English learner in Dubai who told me that the Amazon product I ordered in early March is on a steamer from Asia somewhere at sea. Amazon warned me the item is probably lost, just like they lost my Apple 5 Watch in November.
 I finally got the watch on Christmas Eve. They finally got my current item loaded on a boat but they have no idea when, where, or who will unload it. He asked me in very broken English to please wait for a month or two and he is sure he can get the item to me. I need the item, so I will wait.
 There is no security for the many other items that are disappearing. Many businesses in the just-in-time supply chain in America are out of business or severely limited. This means that items are not being manufactured, not being prepared for shipment, not be loaded on trucks, not being hauled to distribution centers, and not making it to stores.
 We have truck drivers and trucks but they can't haul what they can't load. This problem also afflicts the military. Mom and pop parts manufacturers are going out of business, according to the latest issue of Daedalians newsletter, an Air Force society that meets monthly in Colorado Springs. Critical items like specially machined gun barrels are impacted.
 I have urged my family and friends to take a look around at projects and supplies they may need in the next year. I counsel them to make arrangements to go buy what they need if they can find it. I'm afraid waiting for things to normalize is a losing proposition. They may not normalize for a decade.
 I have lots of screws and fasteners, paint, flour, yeast, 2000 books and many videos and DVDs for when the internet tanks, water in bulk, lots of canned food, dry food, and extra linens, blankets, wood for our wood stove, wood for construction, and an electrical generator that also runs on propane, if I can still find gasoline, which only last a few months in a can.
 I am not recommending any particular list for people. I am saying people need to begin fending for themselves. Makeup is one item that is seriously interrupted.
 This is not the end of days, but it is the beginning of serious uncertainty for the foreseeable future. We will prevail, but there will be bumps.

From virtual classes to open-book exams, the coronavirus pandemic may have forced classroom learning online but the digital divide in the country may turn it into an "operational nightmare", experts have warned.Suicide by a Kerala schoolgirl allegedly over not having access to a smartphone to attend classes, stories of students in remote areas having to sit on rooftops to catch Internet, siblings competing to get their parents' gadgets are just a few case studies of the existing "worrisome" digital divide, they said.According to the Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption on Education in India report, based on the 2017-18 National Sample Survey, less than 15 per cent of rural Indian households have access to Internet as opposed to 42 per cent in urban households. A mere 13 per cent of people surveyed (aged above five) in rural areas -- just 8.5 per cent female -- could use the Internet. The poorest households cannot afford a smartphone or a computer, according to the survey."The implications of school closures in the country due to COVID-19 pandemic are not just about education. They are manifold. The Kerala schoolgirl's death, pictures of a girl trying to study from a tilted rooftop to get signals, three kids in a house trying to have their share of their parents' phone to attend the lessons, these are worrisome case studies. "An unprecedented social disaster can be avoided if more entities pitch into short-term and long-term future of the children in this digital divide," said Rajni Palriwala, HOD, Department of Sociology, Delhi University.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of a slew of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day. As per official statistics, there are over 35 crore students in the country. However, it is not clear as to how many of them have access to digital devices and Internet.While the government has announced easing of certain restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed. "It is good that we have moved online for teaching and learning to ensure that schooling is not completely suspended. But there is a flip-side to it too. When the world has moved indoors and technology has taken over major roles, the digital have-nots are pushed to the edge. Sooner or later they will be left out of the race. "The students in rural India or the poor populace in urban centres are having extreme difficulties in using such services and we don't have any policy in place to address that. In a way, we are only heading towards an operational nightmare," a Delhi University professor said.The professor is among a group of four faculty members who have written a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind against Delhi University's decision to conduct online exams through open-book mode, saying it will push students belonging to economically weaker section and those with disabilities on the wrong side of the digital divide."Education is the greatest equalizer but the coronavirus crisis has come as a setback to this journey in important ways. When schools and colleges move online, students with lesser digital access get further disadvantaged, and those without any digital access are at risk of dropping out altogether. "Especially, at the school level, the digital divide poses a risk of nullifying some of India's hard-won enrolment gains," said Sangeeta D Gadre, a professor at Kirori Mal College.The principal of a school in Haryana's Mewat, who refused to be identified, said, "Like every other country, India is also witnessing an e-learning boom. Classes on Zoom, WhatsApp and Skype are becoming the norm. But the digital disparity is growing starker as more schools begin to adopt virtual tools." "We are reading a lot about how learning is happening online, but are not able to implement it here (Mewat) for the simple reason that not everyone has access to a smartphone or Internet. There can be no shortcuts to either learning or inclusivity. Our policy-makers need to address the fact that online courses will exclude numerous students," she said.Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani has also flagged the issue, saying the shift to online learning is only a "short-term response". "Reimagining education and staying ahead of the curve should be the number 1 priority for the government right now. For households that don't have access to smartphone or feature phone, we will have to use our physical infrastructure. "People may not have a device but they could be close to a digital service centre which will have the devices. Worksheets can be delivered to students and once student finishes the worksheets it can be delivered back to the centres. The centres can then upload the worksheet. Himachal is doing this. We will have to innovate," he said at a virtual conference on "Reimagining Education". Urvashi Sahni, a fellow at the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, said, "Technology has the potential to achieve universal quality education and improve learning outcomes. But in order to unleash its potential, the digital divide (and the embedded gender divide) must be addressed". "Access to technology and Internet is an urgent requirement in the information age. It should no longer be a luxury," she said.

The nine boxers, who have qualified for the Tokyo Games are Amit Panghal (52kg), Manish Kaushik (63kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), M C Mary Kom (51kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), and Pooja Rani (75kg).
 The men traditionally train in Patiala, while the women's camp is based in Delhi.
 The decision to combine the two in Patiala from June 10 was taken on May 23 after a video conference between top BFI officials, the boxers and national coaches.
 "There are logistics that need to be worked out. The boxers have to be brought to Patiala, they have to be tested as well. All these things will need at least a week, so let's see, we are hopeful of things moving ahead in the second half of the month," Sacheti said.
 Sporting activities in the country were halted after the imposition of a lockdown to contain the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in March.
 However, the home ministry allowed opening of sports complexes and stadia, without spectators, in relaxations announced last month. But state governments have the final authority on the matter depending on the COVID-19 situation.
 All the boxers have been training at their respective homes ever since the nationals camps came to a halt in mid-March owing to the virus outbreak, which has caused more than 6,000 deaths in India and wreaked havoc globally.
 In the SAI's Standard Operating Procedure for resumption of training, boxers have been barred from doing human sparring and told not to access the ring for the time being.
 They have also been instructed to use their personal equipment for all forms of training as part of the safety protocol to negate the threat of the virus. In addition, they have also been offered cover for COVID-19 in their medical insurance, as per the SOP made by the BFI.
 The boxers and the federation will have to sign consent forms acknowledging the risk of resumption before being allowed back at the SAI centre.
 The federation remains optimistic of conducting its national events in the usual window of October-November and has also bagged the hosting rights of the Asian Championships, tentatively planned for December.
 So far, track-and-field athletes and hockey players are the only ones to have officially resumed training.

Hours earlier, Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant called on Durkan to resign, describing her as responsible for “violence and brutality” in the city’s response to the week’s protests.
 On Saturday night, Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda — among several elected officials who made their way to the scene — on Twitter told Durkan, Police Chief Carmen Best and the police department to “STOP There is no need to use these dangerous tactics. This is excessive use of force and absolutely unnecessary.”
 The day kicked off differently.
 Thousands of doctors, nurses and other health care workers assembled at Harborview to protest police violence against people of color, as well as systemic racism, and its damaging effects on public health.
 The medical workers' march, like others Saturday, ended at the East Precinct.
 "As soon as we step into medical school, we immediately start getting the education that because you're Black, you're more predisposed to everything — and we don't stop to question why that is," Dr. Estell J. Williams, an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Washington, told the crowd, many wearing their scrubs or white physician's coats. "We get so fixated on disease, we forget about health."
 “Racism is the biggest public health crisis of our time,” said Dr. Nathan Colon, a urological surgeon at the University of Washington, and a first-time protester. Williams, he said, was a close mentor, which inspired him to attend.
 To his own surprise, Jamal Layne found himself later that day in a different march, which had begun beneath the Space Needle, progressed through Belltown to Pike Place Market, then up Capitol Hill to the police precinct. "I mainly try to keep politics out of my life," he said, noting he was the only Black member of his team at a company that contracts with Amazon. "I don't want to be seen as the guy playing the race card."
 He'd been out walking with a friend when he saw the march, and they decided to join. "I see all these people of other colors supporting me," Layne said, gesturing around the crowd. "I haven't been on the front lines like I should."
 That march paused frequently for people to kneel in the streets — at one point, protesters lay down on First Avenue with their hands behind their backs, as if in handcuffs, and chanted "I can't breathe" for more than eight minutes, the length of time the white Minneapolis police officer was seen to have his knee on Floyd's neck, as Floyd called out that he couldn't breathe.
 Other tech workers joined the protests as well. Chris Lwanga, who works for Microsoft, said he showed up for the protest beginning at Seattle Center after seeing it mentioned on social media.
 "I wanted to march, to show my disgust for all the events that have transpired over the last few months," he said. "The American dream is not a reality for many in this country — I'd say the vast majority," he said. "Especially in regards to gender."
 Police escorted the march from the Space Needle without incident, and the law- enforcement presence at the much larger gathering of medical workers was barely discernible.
 "That's normal when a gathering is put together by professional people, people who have clout, positions of power," said Hazzaunah Underwood, a nurse who attended the morning event with her four children. "Up on Capitol Hill, there have been hundreds of cops, the National Guard, and not nearly as many protesters as there are here."
 Her son, who is 7 years old, sat in a wagon alongside a PA that Underwood had brought, and had "future police officer" written on a piece of tape across his chest. He wore a face mask that read: "I can't breathe."

Widespread rainfall along the coast will likely be in the 5-10 inch range, with some areas picking up at least a foot total. These numbers alone would be impressive and cause flooding, but the problem for some of these states is that they have been dealing with excessive rains for the past month, so the ground is already saturated. This will exacerbate the flooding concern for states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida, which have already received at least 8-10 inches in just the last 30 days.
