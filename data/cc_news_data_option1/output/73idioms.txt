The controversy over Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s famous song Hum Dekhenge underlines not just the unadulterated philistinism of sanskaris, but also their ignorance about their own faith and ethos. This is a point that needs to be highlighted. Liberals have correctly pointed out that only an obtuse person could call Faiz or any of his poems anti-Hindu. Even if one is not a connoisseur of Urdu poetry, they can Google and check this out: in this day and age, nobody has an excuse to be ignorant. Yet, ignorance, along with philistinism, is rampant. So, a teacher at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur found the recitation of Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge anti-Hindu. The song was being recited by protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Come what may, that an assistant professor could be so thickheaded as to accuse a communist poet of being an Islamist is a sad commentary on the quality of teachers in the institutions of higher education. Read the piece by Ravi Shanker Kapoor, who argues that the dimwitted objectors have missed the point that the idea expressed in the song is the essence of Vedanta.
