With the Arlington County Civic Federation potentially embarking on a study of alternate county-governance methods, a quick primer on how things came to be in Arlington is in order.
 From Reconstruction until the early 1930s, the county was governed by a three- member board of supervisors, elected by districts.
 But on Nov. 3, 1931, after the General Assembly had approved the county’s request for a new (“county manager”) form of government, the first five members of what came to be known as the County Board were elected to office.
 In both the 1931 and 1935 elections, all five seats were elected simultaneously, with all winners serving four-year terms.
 But as 1939 approached, some in the local civic arena thought a change was in order, and convinced the General Assembly to allow Arlington to elect its board members by staggered terms.
 In the 1939 general election, the top five vote-getters (in a field of eight or of 15, depending on which news source you trust) won election, but for varying lengths of time: the top two vote-getters garnered four-year terms, the next a three-year term, the next a two-year term and the fifth – Leo Lloyd – earned just a one-year slot.
 (Lloyd ran for and won full four-year terms in 1940 and 1944 before dying in office.)
 By 1945, it appeared the bloom was off the rose of the staggered-election concept; the Northern Virginia Sun in early October of that year noted that the Arlington County Civic Federation had decided to ask members of the county legislative delegation to amend the county charter again and revert back to having board members elected all at once.
 The story noted that it had been the Civic Federation that, a decade before, had led the charge for the switch to staggered elections.
 Reverting back never made it through the legislative meat-grinder, and to this day there is at least one County Board seat on the ballot each November.

“Great to have NASA Astronauts return to Earth after very successful two month mission. Thank you to all!” Trump tweeted.
 The last time NASA astronauts returned from space to water was on July 24, 1975, in the Pacific, the scene of most splashdowns, to end a joint U.S.-Soviet mission known as Apollo-Soyuz. The Mercury and Gemini crews in the early to mid-1960s parachuted into the Atlantic, while most of the later Apollo capsules hit the Pacific. The lone Russian “splashdown” was in 1976 on a partially frozen lake amid a blizzard following an aborted mission; the harrowing recovery took hours.
 Gemini and Apollo astronaut Thomas Stafford — the commander of the last crew to splash down — watched the reentry on TV from his Florida home. While pleased with the crew’s safe return, he wasn’t overly impressed. “It’s what we did over 50 years ago," he said.
 Its throwback splashdown aside, SpaceX made history with the mission, which launched May 30 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It was the first time a private company launched people into orbit and also the first launch of NASA astronauts from home turf in nearly a decade. Hurley was the pilot of NASA’s last space shuttle flight in 2011 and the commander of this SpaceX flight.
 NASA turned to SpaceX and also Boeing to build capsules and ferry astronauts to and from the space station, following the retirement of the shuttles. Until Hurley and Behnken rocketed into orbit, NASA astronauts relied on Russian rockets. SpaceX already had experience hauling cargo to the space station, bringing those capsules back to a Pacific splashdown.
 “We are entering a new era of human spaceflight where NASA is no longer the purchaser, owner and operator of all the hardware. We’re going to be a customer, one customer of many," Bridenstine said from Johnson Space Center in Houston. "I would love to see a fleet of crew Dragons servicing not just the International Space Station but also commercial space stations.”
 SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell called the mission a springboard to “doing even harder things,” like collaborating on astronaut flights to the moon and then Mars.
 “There's no question, it was an enormous relief after months of anxiety making sure we could bring Bob and Doug back home safely,” Shotwell said.
 SpaceX needs six weeks to inspect the capsule before launching the next crew around the end of September. This next mission of four astronauts will spend a full six months aboard the space station. Hurley and Behnken’s capsule will be refurbished for another flight next spring. A Houston company run by a former NASA official, meanwhile, has partnered with SpaceX to send three customers to the space station in fall 2021.
 “It took years to get here, we brought the capablity back to America, and we came home safely to our families, and it took a lot of people a lot of time to make that happen," Behnken said back in Houston.
 Boeing doesn’t expect to launch its first crew until next year. The company encountered significant software problems in the debut of its Starliner capsule, with no one aboard, last year. Its capsules will touch down in the U.S. Southwest desert.
 By beating Boeing, SpaceX laid claim to a small U.S. flag left at the space station by Hurley and the rest of the last shuttle crew. Minutes after splashdown, Musk tweeted a flag emoji followed by “returned."
 Also on board: a toy dinosaur named Tremor, sent into space by the astronauts’ young sons. The two boys recorded a wake-up call for their fathers Sunday morning.
 “Don’t worry, you can sleep in tomorrow,” said Behnken’s 6-year-old son Theo, who was promised a puppy after the flight. “Hurry home so we can go get my dog.”

 In our Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8 review, we loved its slim, lightweight design and bright, vibrant 1080p display. We gave it the Editor's Choice award for its fast performance and class-leading keyboard.
 The new ThinkPad Carbon X1 sports the same sleek shape and stealthy finish as the previous-gen Carbon X1 Gen 7. Just about the only thing that distinguishes the two is an "X1" stamp under the signature ThinkPad logo.
 Reinforced with carbon fiber, the ThinkPad Carbon X1's military-grade specs withstand high altitudes, subzero temperatures, drops and spills.
 The laptop's security features include secure data encryption, a ThinkShutter webcam cover, an integrated fingerprint sensor, and an IR camera for Windows Hello login.
 At 12.7 x 8.5 x 0.6 inches, the 2.4-pound ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8 is about the same size as the ExpertBook B9450 0.6 inches, 2.2 pounds) and the Elite Dragonfly (11.9 x 7.8 x 0.6 inches, 2.5 pounds). It's significantly lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Pro (12 x 8.4 x 0.6 inches, 3.1 pounds).
 For an ultraportable laptop, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8 has a generous assortment of ports. It's equipped with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB 3.1 ports, and an HDMI 1.4 input. There's also a lock slot and headphone/mic jack combo on board.
 At a whopping $888 off, the 8th Gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon is an incredible value.
 On a smaller budget? As an alternative, you can get last year's ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7 on sale starting from $899.
 We tested the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7 and it also received the Editor's Choice stamp of approval for design, stunning display and long battery life.
 Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon deals end August 9 so act fast to take advantage of these incredible savings.

Investors could argue Repligen is enjoying a pandemic bump that won't prove sustainable in the long run, but management is targeting at least $500 million in annual revenue by 2023. That puts shares at about 16 times 2023 revenue. Given the company's cash position and history of acquisitions, that could prove to be a conservative estimate. Therefore, investors seeking profitable growth won't do much better than Repligen, although don't be surprised if shares pull back in a broader market correction.

I typically keep comments short and sweet, but I just watched the trailer with my family and I’m excited. 🎶please don’t get me hype🎶🤪 “Black Is King” is a labor of love. It is my passion project that I have been filming, researching and editing day and night for the past year. I’ve given it my all and now it’s yours. It was originally filmed as a companion piece to “The Lion King: The Gift” soundtrack and meant to celebrate the breadth and beauty of Black ancestry. I could never have imagined that a year later, all the hard work that went into this production would serve a greater purpose. The events of 2020 have made the film’s vision and message even more relevant, as people across the world embark on a historic journey. We are all in search of safety and light. Many of us want change. I believe that when Black people tell our own stories, we can shift the axis of the world and tell our REAL history of generational wealth and richness of soul that are not told in our history books. With this visual album, I wanted to present elements of Black history and African tradition, with a modern twist and a universal message, and what it truly means to find your self-identity and build a legacy. I spent a lot of time exploring and absorbing the lessons of past generations and the rich history of different African customs. While working on this film, there were moments where I’ve felt overwhelmed, like many others on my creative team, but it was important to create a film that instills pride and knowledge. I only hope that from watching, you leave feeling inspired to continue building a legacy that impacts the world in an immeasurable way. I pray that everyone sees the beauty and resilience of our people. This is a story of how the people left MOST BROKEN have EXTRAORDINARY gifts.❤️✊🏾 Thank you to Blitz, Emmanuel, Ibra, Jenn, Pierre, Dikayl, Kwasi and all the brilliant creatives. Thank you to all at Disney for giving this Black woman the opportunity to tell this story. This experience has been an affirmation of a grander purpose. My only goal is that you watch it with your family and that it gives you pride. Love y’all, B

Last week the CEOs of the four tech giants made a historic appearance before Congress. For five hours these issues were probed and examined, with US lawmakers (for the most part) armed with well-researched questions. But will it ultimately lead to change? In the short term, it's unlikely. US antitrust laws are framed around proving market dominance leads to higher prices for consumers. When many of the tech firms under the spotlight offer their services for free, it becomes difficult to prove that consumers are worse off. In the long term, though, the Antitrust Subcommittee's investigation may lead to a modernisation of antitrust laws that make them fit for the digital age. But in the meantime, the tech giants look set to consolidate their power. Just a day after the hearing, Apple, Facebook and Amazon reported blowout earnings, with Google parent Alphabet the dark spot on the otherwise gleaming report card. Even then, its revenue dropped by just 2% year-on-year at a time when advertising budgets have been reigned in. If a once in a lifetime pandemic can't slow the march of Big Tech, what can?

After a year in the club, I felt that I was finally able to embrace the club's fun without stressing too much about the "rigor" of theater. Don't get me wrong; Triangle is a very professional community in many ways, especially in terms of the quality of our shows, the number of hours spent rehearsing, writing, teching, and the sheer number of talented club members. But still, Triangle is, first and foremost, a student organization and a community of undergraduates. In the end, we all are in the club because we have fun.

This new face covering order is in place because the town is seeing an increase in foot traffic.
 “Our general downtown area…the sidewalks tend to be narrow, pedestrian traffic is heavier than other parts of town, and especially this time of year, we see traffic picking up, students coming back to town, businesses are reopen,” Sunryd noted.
 Sunryd told Western Mass News that those who do not follow the order could face a fine.
 “Anyone who violates the order could potentially face a penalty of $50 for the first offense,$100 for second offense, and $200 for subsequent offenses and each day would constitute separate offense,” Sunryd explained.
 However, she added that the main focus is to keep people safe. Student ambassadors will be out in the public, helping inform people on the new rule and potentially handout masks for those who do not have one.
 “What we are really seeking we want to create culture of compliance, where everyone recognizes their own responsibility, so we’re really placing an emphasis especially early on education and information, rather than the enforcement and penalties,” Sunryd added.
 The order is in effect until the board of health gives notice this is no longer necessary or the COVID-19 Massachusetts state of emergency is suspended.

"The Prime Minister is 69 and he's running the country in these times. Are they telling him to step down?" the Bengal coach counter-questioned during an exclusive interview to PTI.


  If CAB goes by the book, then Lal will not be allowed to join the pre-season camp but feisty former Bengal captain said that one SOP won't determine how he would lead his life.


  "Me as a person, whether I coach Bengal or not is immaterial but I will live my life. Don't expect me that I'm 65 years old, so I will lock myself in a room for the next 30 years. This does not happen like this," the cancer survivor, who turned 65 on Saturday, said.


  Lal, a Bengal legend made it clear that while he would maintain all social distancing norms, he won't just quarantine himself just like that.


  "I will take precautions like everybody else -- social distancing, hand washing, sanitising, mask-wearing all that I will do. Unnecessarily there will be no foolhardiness.


  "But I will not quarantine myself just because I'm 60-plus. The virus does not know the difference between 59 and 60," he said.


  The hero of Bengal's Ranji Trophy triumph in 1989-90, Lal was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare type of salivary glands cancer four years back, but he overcame the disease and gained abundant hope in the process.


  "I'm very fit and strong. In fact, I've never been this fitter in my life. I'm not at all worried," Lal who guided Bengal to their first Ranji final appearance in 13 years last season said.


  "I know the whole concern is about people above-60. I understand that. But I think things will work out. A couple of months down the line, the virus will start subsiding. Much before any vaccine or anything," he sounded confident.


  The former India opener further said there's no news of him being discontinued.


  "Certainly, I'm continuing. I've got no news from any quarters that you know I''m not continuing."


  Reacting to the advisory, Lal said it could be temporary and can change in due course keeping in mind the situation.


  "An advisory can change, in fact, it itself says it can change and it's temporary. The situation is so fluid and uncertain, nobody knows about tomorrow. We will wait and see how it pans out. It also discourages and there's no binding on it."


  Lal also said restriction he understands is on health grounds and not a reflection of his work.


  "They are trying to look after me only. It''s not any reflection on my abilities. We will see how it goes."


  He said that his wards are all pumped up for the upcoming season and waiting for the resumption nod from CAB.


  "The CAB will have to decide to take into all the consideration with State and Union government. They are working very hard and are really pumped up. My job to keep them motivated and wait for their time," he added.


  Meanwhile, CAB president Avishek Dalmiya also hoped that BCCI's SOP was of "temporary nature" and maybe "amended".


  "It is presumed that the restrictions for individuals above a certain age or with underlying medical conditions mentioned in the advisory is of a temporary nature considering the current situation and taken in the interest of persons beyond a certain age for their safety," Dalmiya said in a statement.

Oh, how far we’ve come since March. Back then, when COVID-19 seemed more like a boogeyman than the terrifyingly real monster it turned out to be, one positive test in the NBA shut down the world of sports for four months. Now, after COVID-19 has taken nearly 153,000 American lives according to the CDC, and dozens of college football players have tested positive, we’re up in arms about canceled rivalry games.
 Whether schedules are conference-only or conference-only-plus-one, there’s no gridiron bubble. Players, coaches, and attending staff will still travel throughout the country. They will still interact with people outside their teams. And no matter how stringent the individual safety protocols, there’s no 100% effective means to corral college-aged kids and make them look at the bigger picture.
 Come Sept. 26, the SEC has the incredibly tall order of not only keeping their players safe, but also preventing a serious contribution to our collective failure at the once trumpeted and now seemingly forgotten effort to get a grip on this pandemic.

One trillion is one thousand billion or one million million.
   
 In money terms, $1 trillion is a stack of $100 bills 631 miles high.
   
 Now consider that the three coronavirus relief bills already approved by Congress will collectively spend about $3 trillion, or a $100-bill stack 1,893 miles high.
   
 But wait, Congress isn't done. Its leaders are now negotiating how to spend between $1 trillion and $4 trillion on a fourth relief package. That would add another 631 to 2,524 miles of $100 bills to the stack.
   
 With that kind of lunar spending, why should you worry about a relatively puny congressional request to raise the annual spending authority of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) from $30 billion a year to $68 billion?
   
 Because in both principle and practice, the CCC should not be a political slush fund to cover up farm and trade policy malpractice.
   
 The CCC is, by design, USDA's checking account for most Farm Bill-authorized programs except crop insurance. Its checks pay for everything from soil conservation programs to flood relief.
   
 Its financial reach, though, is limited; Congress currently restricts CCC spending to $30 billion per fiscal year. According to figures cited by the conservative Heritage Foundation, "The CCC has not come close to breaching that limit from FY 2005 to FY 2019."
   
 That streak ended under the Trump Administration, however, when it tapped CCC for "$28 billion of so-called trade aid to farmers in 2018 and 2019" to pay for its tariff war with China, notes a July 16 Heritage report.
   
 The tariff fight, when added to an already faltering ag economy, helped undermine farm income. To shore it up, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue devised a clever scheme, called the Market Facilitation Program, to send CCC cash to farmers.
   
 Perdue had the authority because after the GOP takeover of Congress and the White House in 2016, Obama-era limits were lifted on USDA's "discretionary" use of CCC money. In short, the Trump Administration used the CCC to fill the income gap fueled by own its trade policies while bypassing Congress.
   
 According to a July 14 analysis by Politico, USDA's "trade bailout has now spanned three years, and surpassed $23 billion, even though it was never appropriated by Congress. Instead the money was funneled through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation…"
   
 Importantly, no one in the Administration asked Congress if it could use the CCC this way and, strikingly, few on the Democratically-led House Ag Committee even asked for an accounting.
   
 It was just a "'Hey, let's tap the bank. We'll buy our way out of this'" problem, Neil Hamilton, the former director and emeritus professor of Drake University's Agricultural Law Center told Politico.
   
 But now the problem is too big for even the CCC to mop up. No worry, some in Congress have a plan.
   
 On May 5, Rep. Austin Scott, who, coincidentally, is the GOP congressman from Perdue's home district in Georgia, proposed legislation to "permanently increase the CCC's annual borrowing limit from $30 billion a year to $68 billion."
   
 Few in Congress objected to the plan, but former USDA officials and fiscal watchdogs howled.
   
 The increase, argued former USDA chief economist Joseph Glauber and Vincent Smith, the American Enterprise Institute's director of agriculture, in a July 20 op/ed in The Hill, allows "any administration free rein to spend… with no accountability to Congress…"
   
 Others joined the chorus. The Heritage Foundation, in its detailed July 16 report, noted that current pandemic spending is "so broad" that an expanded CCC "might allow the Agriculture Secretary to provide money to special interests that have nothing to do with farming…"
   
 Like, maybe, already favored meatpackers?
   
 Glauber told Politico that raising CCC "farm aid" is like "giving USDA a blank piece of paper and saying, 'Here's a bunch of money. You decide how to spend it.'"
   
 He's right; putting $38 billion more into what already looks a lot like a multi-billion dollar political slush fund virtually guarantees more bad policy --especially if you can hide it behind a stack of $100 bills.
   
 Make that a 24-mile-tall stack of $100 bills.

Due anni dopo, nel ricordo e nel rispetto delle 43 vittime di quel tragico giorno - continua l'esponente dell'esecutivo su Facebook -, viene inaugurato il nuovo viadotto autostradale, progettato da Renzo Piano e costruito a tempo record. Non è una giornata di festa. Non può esserlo. Bisogna chiedere giustizia per i familiari delle vittime, che il presidente Mattarella ha incontrato prima dell’inaugurazione, e lavorare affinché episodi simili non possano più ripetersi. Dobbiamo assicurarci", prosegue Ascani, "che ci siano tutte le risorse necessarie per il controllo e la manutenzione delle nostre infrastrutture. Investire sulle nostre aziende, sulle tecnologie e sulle competenze, per diminuire i tempi di costruzione delle opere, assicurandoci che siano sicure. Oggi - conclude il viceministro - si segna un nuovo punto di partenza, di unione fra passato e presente, di memoria e di impegno comune". (Rin)

Two more persons, including prime accused Monu, were arrested on Monday in connection with the alleged attack on a truck driver this past week, the Gurugram police said. The driver was attacked after the accused suspected him of transporting beef.
 Four persons have been accounted for in the case so far. Monu, a dairy owner from Rithoj village in Gurugram, and his accomplice Anesh, from Sohna Ki Dhani, were arrested in Sohna.
 Monu had hit Lukmaan with a hammer causing serious injuries. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Crime) Preet Pal Sangwan said Monu was a self-styled “gau rakshak” and ran a dairy in Badshahpur village. Anesh also runs a dairy.
 Mr. Sangwan said seven more accused, who are on the run, were all self-styled “gau rakshaks”.
 “They suspected Lukmaan of transporting beef and tried to stop him after a brief chase. When he did not stop, they continued chasing him till the time he reached Jama Masjid market,” said Mr. Sangwan.

First and foremost, Thank you. Thank you to each and every individual who has prayed for me, thought of me, sent me their love and has showered me with their support. In this present moment, it is my only responsibility to be real with myself and to be real with the ones who truly love me and care for my healing. I have without fail, shared with you my brightest days, and I know that sharing with you what has been my darkest will be the light for any man or woman who is feeling the same defeat I felt just only a week ago. Every one of us has a desire, whether small or big, to make it out of where we come from to an ideal future place that includes, freedom to be who we choose, security for our children and families, and fortune to share with the ones we love. We believe these things can co-exist with just being happy. I believed that, that as a black woman, as an artist, an influence, a personality I could shape my world, and with whom I believed to be my partners, they could help me share my world. Over the past 11 years there were promises made to protect and portray my story, with the authenticity and honesty I gave. I was betrayed, taken advantage of, overworked, and underpaid. I wrote a letter over 2 months ago asking to be freed from what I believed was excessive and unfair. I explained in personal detail the demise I was experiencing. My cry for help went totally ignored. However the demands persisted. It was my spirit, and my soul that was tainted the most. There are a few things I count on most to be, a good mother, a good daughter, a good partner, a good sister, and a good person. Who I was, begun to mean little to nothing, because it would only be how I was portrayed on television that would matter. It was witnessing the slow death of the woman I became, that discouraged my will to fight. I felt like I was no longer living, I was existing for the purpose of a corporations gain and ratings, and that killed me. Mental illness is real. We have to normalize acknowledging it and stop associating it with shame and humiliation. The pain that I have experienced over the past 11 years has slowly ate away at my spirit and my mental.

Tuesday begins warm and very humid with a chance for showers. Scattered rain is likely on and off throughout the day along with an occasional thunderstorm in the afternoon. Temperatures hold in the 70s for most with increasing wind into the evening.
 Details: The track of Isaias has trended a bit farther West, meaning our forecast changes a bit. For the Pioneer Valley, wind may be a bit stronger with sustained wind rising to 25-35mph and gusts reaching 50mph by Tuesday evening and night as the storm approaches. Rainfall amounts look a bit lighter with the valley getting a half inch to 2 inches of rain, while Berkshire County may see 2-4 inches with isolated higher amounts. Flash flooding will be possible for everyone, due to the threat of imbedded thunderstorms, which would bring isolated higher amounts of rain.
 A tornado threat is also a concern for Tuesday afternoon and evening on the eastern side of the tropical storm, which includes most of southern New England.
 Overall, the brunt of the storm will impact western Mass Tuesday evening and early night, with conditions improving overnight. The storm will be well out of our area by sunrise Wednesday!
 The remainder of the week looks to be dominated by high pressure, which will give us good sunshine, lower humidity and light breezes. Temperatures in the lower to middle 80s are on tap to end the week, then we turn warmer over the weekend.

It's not just that cases are surging in Japan, but the positivity rate is also increasing, which is another unfavorable sign. Japan's initial approach was to focus on pooled testing and manual contact tracing, but both approaches lose effectiveness if the number of cases grows suddenly, and despite progress, Japan's testing has fallen behind the curve. To make matters even worse, there are also accusations of officials misrepresenting data.

Green explained that he has behaved much like other people who date. "Some people use dating apps. They talk to multiple people. They go on multiple dates. They spend time with people until you feel a connection with somebody and then something builds from there," he said. "What's unfortunate for me in this situation is I'll literally go on one date with somebody, not even a date, just like meet somebody, have lunch and all of sudden it's written as like, 'Oh, his new fling' and 'Ooh he's playing two women at the same time.'"

The Town of Occoquan announced Monday it has canceled the Occoquan RiverFest & Craft Show slated for Sept. 26-27.
 In announcing the cancellation, the town cited restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and concern for the health of the community. The town plans for the Occoquan RiverFest & Craft Show to return in the spring.
 Town events director Julie Little, said, “As we head into a new season together, we resolve to keep Occoquan thriving, as a beacon of hope to our community. We continue to provide opportunities to visit and enjoy Occoquan safely. We could not be prouder of our local businesses who are working tirelessly to provide safe shopping options to our patrons. They have made a strong effort to remain open and comply with the current health and safety requirements.”
 Occoquan originally planned the inaugural RiverFest event in the spring, but postponed it to the fall shortly after the pandemic began and combined it with the town's annual fall craft show.

No bubble. No league-wide quarantine protocols. No problem, right? The question answers itself. After its first three-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies from July 24-26, the Miami Marlins’ next 10 games were postponed. If Miami doesn’t make up those outings, there goes one-sixth of its 60-game season. Oops.
 So, what happened? On July 31, Scott Miller of Bleacher Report tweeted that the MLB found the Marlins were “very lapse” in their compliance with protocols around leaving hotel rooms while competing in preseason games against the Braves in Atlanta. Yet as CBS Sports reported, the MLB did not prescribe penalties for extracurricular activities. Instead, it expected players to take the best interest of the league to heart when deciding whether to hit the hotel bar or local clubs.
 Unfortunately for the MLB, the Marlins weren’t as forward thinking as the Orlando Pride were 40 days ago. Now that 29 positive tests have cropped up among MLB players and staff, and league commissioner Rob Manfred reportedly said the nascent 2020 season could be on the brink of shutting down, the non- bubble, fingers-crossed approach seems glaringly inadequate.
 Football at what cost?
 While there was never the possibility of confining college football athletes to an NWSL or NBA-style bubble, it will be difficult for the SEC to conduct 10 uninterrupted games this fall.
 The week-long break between games is definitely helpful, but if a player tests positive a day or two after a game, not only will they almost certainly miss the next contest, but both teams will be operationally paralyzed for a day or two — or at least should be — to conduct contact tracing and multiple rounds of testing.
 This risk of mid-week stand-stills is only heightened by the potential for off-field activities. Who’s stopping players from taking the Marlins route and going out on their own time? LSU already proved what will happen then. Even if conferences sanction teams for breaking protocols, who knows if coach-to- player and player-to-player supervision will suffice to control behavior.
 Only daily testing could prevent an asymptomatic player from spreading COVID-19 to classmates, teammates or fellow bar patrons. While that would be a wise route for college teams, it calls into question the ethicality of universities providing those resources for student athletes and not their full student bodies.
 Should outbreaks occur, the question will then become whether conferences cancel teams’ subsequent games or allow them to carry on and risk staggered exposure and complicated quarantine logistics. The whole idea behind the Big Ten and SEC’s conference-only schedules is to provide flexibility and the freedom to postpone or cancel competition at will. And with only two open dates in SEC schedules this fall, including the week before the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 19, rescheduling isn’t really an option.
 It’s a brave new world for college football. And if stopping the spread of this pandemic requires cancellations, so be it. It’s not just for players’ sake, but for the sake of the communities anticipating their return with bated breath.

LIBERTY TWP. — Christina Klespies said she is able to see in retrospect how she let her guard down in allowing her son free rein in going to high school graduation parties and an out-of-state camping trip amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 But like so many other parents, she felt badly that her son, Ryan, was missing out on so much of his senior year at Chesterton High School.
 There was no time for regrets, however, when she received word two weeks ago that 18-year-old Ryan and others taking part in the camping trip to Wisconsin began suffering headaches and other milder symptoms of COVID-19.
 She took charge of the situation, and by the time the young men returned home from their trip, Klespies had made arrangements for her son and two of his camping companions to spend the next 10 days in isolation at her Liberty Township home.

"The Prime Minister is 69 and he's running the country in these times. Are they telling him to step down?" the Bengal coach counter-questioned during an exclusive interview to PTI.If CAB goes by the book, then Lal will not be allowed to join the pre-season camp but feisty former Bengal captain said that one SOP won't determine how he would lead his life."Me as a person, whether I coach Bengal or not is immaterial but I will live my life. Don't expect me that I'm 65 years old, so I will lock myself in a room for the next 30 years. This does not happen like this," the cancer survivor, who turned 65 on Saturday, said.Lal, a Bengal legend made it clear that while he would maintain all social distancing norms, he won't just quarantine himself just like that."I will take precautions like everybody else -- social distancing, hand washing, sanitising, mask-wearing all that I will do. Unnecessarily there will be no foolhardiness."But I will not quarantine myself just because I'm 60-plus. The virus does not know the difference between 59 and 60," he said.The hero of Bengal's Ranji Trophy triumph in 1989-90, Lal was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare type of salivary glands cancer four years back, but he overcame the disease and gained abundant hope in the process."I'm very fit and strong. In fact, I've never been this fitter in my life. I'm not at all worried," Lal who guided Bengal to their first Ranji final appearance in 13 years last season said."I know the whole concern is about people above-60. I understand that. But I think things will work out. A couple of months down the line, the virus will start subsiding. Much before any vaccine or anything," he sounded confident.The former India opener further said there's no news of him being discontinued."Certainly, I'm continuing. I've got no news from any quarters that you know I''m not continuing."Reacting to the advisory, Lal said it could be temporary and can change in due course keeping in mind the situation."An advisory can change, in fact, it itself says it can change and it's temporary. The situation is so fluid and uncertain, nobody knows about tomorrow. We will wait and see how it pans out. It also discourages and there's no binding on it."Lal also said restriction he understands is on health grounds and not a reflection of his work."They are trying to look after me only. It''s not any reflection on my abilities. We will see how it goes."He said that his wards are all pumped up for the upcoming season and waiting for the resumption nod from CAB."The CAB will have to decide to take into all the consideration with State and Union government. They are working very hard and are really pumped up. My job to keep them motivated and wait for their time," he added.Meanwhile, CAB president Avishek Dalmiya also hoped that BCCI's SOP was of "temporary nature" and maybe "amended"."It is presumed that the restrictions for individuals above a certain age or with underlying medical conditions mentioned in the advisory is of a temporary nature considering the current situation and taken in the interest of persons beyond a certain age for their safety," Dalmiya said in a statement."This is because the document clearly states that all such individuals should be discouraged from participating in the camp activities until suitable guidelines are issued by the Government.

It gave us better results out of the box and was quicker to deploy with a lower cost of ownership,” said Ricardo Letosa, Senior Product Manager at SITA. “There was no question we would use Rosette for contact tracing as well because you don’t check into a hospital with your passport number. When you have no common identifiers between health and travel records besides name and date of birth, you have to go with the best name matching you can get, and for SITA that is Rosette from Basis Technology.”
