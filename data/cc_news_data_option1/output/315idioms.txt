The Tiger is a magnetic creature and few animals can resist your raw, seductive appeal when you’re on the prowl. Although the Tiger is not the King of the Jungle, you are most certainly Queen of all you survey and your authoritative manner generally ensures that you stay in control. You don’t deal with failure well, though, and demonstrate a fiery temper if challenged. Tigers are smart and inventive in business, and you’re very good at taking the initiative and winning. While you are a powerful force to be reckoned with sexually, snaring your prey with your seductive charms, you hate being caged yourself and retreat if you sense an emotional trap. The most compatible match for a Tiger is a Horse or a Dog.

On the other hand, however, you hate superficiality or deceit in others. This, combined with your own underlying emotional insecurity, means you guard your feelings closely and are wary of new people. You prefer to stick to your pack and those who have earned your trust. Dogs are sticklers for issues and are swift to judge those they see as unethical. You will fiercely protect your values and stand your ground against anyone who attacks your beliefs. Dogs are most compatible with Tigers or Horses.

U.S. gas exports have surged amid the nation's shale boom, but plummeting prices may now throttle back shipments or encourage sustained maintenance while firms weather the storm. Producers and companies with offtake agreements may decide not to load cargoes because prices are too low to earn a profit after accounting for shipping costs.
 With cargoes from the Gulf of Mexico currently priced around $2.65 per million BTU, cash margins are positive only because of weak U.S. benchmark prices, according to Robert Sims, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. There's a chance that production could be reduced if the spread between benchmark Henry Hub and U.S. Gulf LNG narrows 25 cents, he said. Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive officer of Gunvor Group Ltd., the biggest independent LNG trader, sees the market about 50 cents away from shut downs.
 "I think we can see even lower prices in the next few months," Tornqvist said in an interview this week in Davos. "The supply and demand balance doesn't look good."

Shreyas Iyer was the star of the show as he slammed an unbeaten fifty to take Team India to victory in the first T20 international against New Zealand at the Eden Park in Auckland. Shreyas was in top form as blasted the Kiwi bowlers all over the park en route his unbeaten 58 off just 29 deliveries. Due to Iyer's brilliance at the end, India chased down New Zealand's total of 203 runs with a over to spare.
 He has been getting the plaudits from all corners and has now been hailed as the future of Indian cricket. Iyer has quickly established himself as an integral part of the India's limited-overs cricket team with impressive performances against West Indies, Sri Lanka and now New Zealand. Iyer took to Twitter as he commented on his performance saying that he is thankful for all the wishes that came after the match.
 'Iiiyer up the ladder. Thank you everyone for your wishes. I'm going to remember this one for a long, long time. #TeamIndia,' Iyer said on Twitter.
 Once New Zealand had put on 203 runs on the board after batting first, Virat Kohli and his men knew they were up against it. With a solitary T20I win to their credit on New Zealand soil, Team India had to break a few records to register only their 4th win overall against the Kiwis in the 12th T20I between the two teams.
 Their dismal past record notwithstanding, the Indians got about to do their job but were struck a blow when they lost Rohit Sharma early on. KL Rahul and Virat Kohli kept the momentum in India's favour as they added valuable 99 runs for the second wicket. Rahul showcased the full array of his shot making as scored 56 in just 27 deliveries. Kohli was equally good as he kept the scoreboard ticking and contributed 45 off 32 balls.
 But once the duo fell in quick succession, India were in for a tough final 10 overs. But Shreyas Iyer took it upon himself to decimate the Kiwi bowlers. Iyer packed a massive punch as he hit five fours and three maximums to take India home with an over to go. He remained unbeaten on 58 off just 29 deliveries.
 As a result of this effort India managed to complete their highest successful chase away from home. The earlier record was set in 2018 when India chased down a target of 199 runs against England. This was thus India's first 200 plus chase in a T20 international outside India.
 Australia and South Africa have achieved the feat twice, while West Indies, England, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Qatar have done it once.

In August, a report from a federal monitor for the DOJ settlement urged state officials to boost funding for mental health services, not cut it. Fitzgerald declined to elaborate after Thursday’s meeting on whether the cuts and the $13 million shift to hospital beds might run afoul of the federal government.
 “We’ll leave it to [the] Department of Justice and the lawyers to determine how that impacts compliance,” she said.
 Fitzgerald’s rundown of the cuts alarmed lawmakers on the House and Senate Appropriations committees.
 Rep. Katie Dempsey, who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing mental health, said she was startled to learn about details of the cuts and see the stark language used in last fall’s internal agency memo.
 “The loss of services, it’s hard to even imagine right now how we’re going to deal with this,” said Dempsey, R-Rome.
 Rural Georgia communities especially could suffer from fewer state dollars for mental health, said Rep. Darlene Taylor, R-Thomasville. She said crisis episodes involving mentally ill people in rural areas are on the rise, and budget cuts that hinder getting help for those people should not move forward.
 “This budget, I cannot see how this is going to work,” Taylor said. “A spoonful of sugar is not going to make this go down.”

Hammersmith and Fulham has set up a similar group.
 But Labour councillors said they thought the time line was “kicking the problem down the road".
 Deputy Labour Mohammed Bahktiar said the Council had a history of failing to produce action plans to clean up pollution and feared kicking climate emergency action 20 years down the line was a signal they are "not taking the scale of the crisis seriously”.

 He called for greening, such as a green wall or hedges to help curb the problem.

Mucho ruido es lo que ha ocasionado estos dos últimos días el nombre de Dani Ceballos en la afición del Real Betis por su situación futbolística actual. El utrerano ha expresado públicamente que desea salir del Arsenal -club al que llegó el pasado verano cedido por el Real Madrid- debido a la falta de minutos. Según pudo saber Cadena SER, el centrocampista ha hablado con su actual entrenador, Mikel Arteta, para poner punto y final a su periplo en Londres. No es para menos, pues no goza de un solo minuto desde el 6 de noviembre, partido que disputaron los ‘gunners’ ante el Guimaraes correspondiente a la cuarta jornada del Grupo F de la Europa League.Así las cosas, el Madrid tendrá que reubicar al jugador, al menos, para lo que resta de temporada y el equipo mejor posicionado es el Valencia -según adelantó Radio Marca-, a pesar de que el Arsenal se haya mostrado reacio a romper la cesión del andaluz. Tal y como han informado, los agentes del futbolista se han reunido con César Sánchez, director deportivo del cuadro che.Por su parte, el interés del Betis es real. No ahora, sino cada vez que el jugador se ha puesto a tiro. Más allá de que su marcha fuera como fuere, Ceballos siempre ha gustado y gusta, y mucho, en el seno de la casa heliopolitana, la única en la que el futbolista ha logrado destacar, dado que su proyección, hasta la fecha, se ha visto frenada por protagonizar un papel secundario, tanto en el Madrid como en el Arsenal con la llegada de Arteta al banquillo. Sin embargo, su regreso se antoja difícil, no sólo por el fuerte interés de la entidad valenciana -el fichaje se puede hacer oficial en las próximas horas-, sino también porque el Betis no aceptaría una nueva cesión sin opción a compra, como es el caso de Carles Aleñá, y, además, su alta ficha -3 millones de euros netos-, que actualmente está siendo pagada íntegramente por el conjunto británico. Además, el jugador no ha cesado en expresar su deseo de estar en un club que juegue competición europea. Aunque, pasa lo de siempre, en las últimas horas de mercado todo puede pasar, más tratándose de la actual dirección del Betis, que ha sorprendido a su afición con incorporaciones de la talla de Lo Celso o Fekir.Lo cierto y verdad es que el jugador tiene contrato con el Madrid hasta 2023 y su falta de continuidad podría cerrarle las puertas la próxima campaña en el club merengue, por lo que es más que probable que haya que estar atentos a su estado venidero en el próximo mercado veraniego.

We don’t believe that’s the best thing to focus on,” Lorenzen said. “What actually is more efficient is to focus on a human being who, with all of their knowledge, skills and life experiences, can use those to make a personalized shopping experience that’s way richer than what you can get through any kind of Alexa experience.”
 Lorenzen added, “We are kind of throwing the gauntlet down with (Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos and Alexa to say that Alexa is inhuman whereas Zina is relentless. We can have a challenge with the best Alexa can do with the best of what our personal shopper Zina can do. Zina will win hands down every time.”
 Lorenzen encourages people to express interest and inquiries on the ShopO Group of Watertown Facebook page or contact him via email at LeeL@shopo.com.

Shreyas Iyer was the star of the show as he slammed an unbeaten fifty to take Team India to victory in the first T20 international against New Zealand at the Eden Park in Auckland. Shreyas was in top form as blasted the Kiwi bowlers all over the park en route his unbeaten 58 off just 29 deliveries. Due to Iyer's brilliance at the end, India chased down New Zealand's total of 203 runs with a over to spare.He has been getting the plaudits from all corners and has now been hailed as the future of Indian cricket. Iyer has quickly established himself as an integral part of the India's limited-overs cricket team with impressive performances against West Indies, Sri Lanka and now New Zealand. Iyer took to Twitter as he commented on his performance saying that he is thankful for all the wishes that came after the match. 'Iiiyer up the ladder. Thank you everyone for your wishes. I'm going to remember this one for a long, long time. #TeamIndia,' Iyer said on Twitter.Once New Zealand had put on 203 runs on the board after batting first, Virat Kohli and his men knew they were up against it. With a solitary T20I win to their credit on New Zealand soil, Team India had to break a few records to register only their 4th win overall against the Kiwis in the 12th T20I between the two teams.Their dismal past record notwithstanding, the Indians got about to do their job but were struck a blow when they lost Rohit Sharma early on. KL Rahul and Virat Kohli kept the momentum in India's favour as they added valuable 99 runs for the second wicket. Rahul showcased the full array of his shot making as scored 56 in just 27 deliveries. Kohli was equally good as he kept the scoreboard ticking and contributed 45 off 32 balls.But once the duo fell in quick succession, India were in for a tough final 10 overs. But Shreyas Iyer took it upon himself to decimate the Kiwi bowlers. Iyer packed a massive punch as he hit five fours and three maximums to take India home with an over to go. He remained unbeaten on 58 off just 29 deliveries.As a result of this effort India managed to complete their highest successful chase away from home. The earlier record was set in 2018 when India chased down a target of 199 runs against England. This was thus India's first 200 plus chase in a T20 international outside India.Australia and South Africa have achieved the feat twice, while West Indies, England, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Qatar have done it once.
