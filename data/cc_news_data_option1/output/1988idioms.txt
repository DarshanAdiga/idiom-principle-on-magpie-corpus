BATON ROUGE -- A measure winding through the Legislature asks Louisiana universities to adopt a flexible and holistic admissions approach amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Many students were unable to take the ACT in April after it was canceled due to the novel coronavirus. The House resolution asks the Louisiana Board of Regents to let schools assess potential students applying for the summer and fall semesters by looking their full academic records rather than just test scores, as some may not have any.
   
 "Many of the students were not able to take the ACT in April, and that's moved until September," said Sen. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, who authored the resolution. "Because of this crisis we ought to do everything and anything we can to look at the whole student for the summer and the fall. I don't know of any university who is not doing that. I just think it's a step in the right direction."
   
 The House Education Committee advanced the resolution Tuesday, sending it to the full House.
      
 Referring to the impact of the virus, Tom Galligan, LSU's interim president, said at a recent Baton Rouge Press Club meeting that he expected "we are all going to be more flexible than we might have otherwise been in the past as we learn how to deal with these issues."
   
 LSU's move to holistic admissions in 2018 sparked controversy with the Board of Regents, which oversees higher education in the state. Without consulting their own LSU board of supervisors, school administrators began admitting students who did not meet the minimum requirements for ACT scores and grades in an effort to attract more students.
   
 LSU touted bringing in the largest, most diverse and highest-achieving freshman class in its history in 2018 -- its first year using a holistic approach to admissions.
   
 Former LSU President F. King Alexander argued then that other universities across the nation looked at resumes, essays, recommendations and more to assess potential students rather than just test scores and GPA.
   
 Those opposed to holistic admissions, including members of the oversight boards and some of the universities' biggest donors, argued that the policy lowered LSU's standards and prestige.
   
 "I haven't received any push back," Fields said Tuesday. "The Board of Regents has directed the institutions across the state to look at holistic approaches due to the calamity we find ourselves in. I've talked to all of the system presidents, and none of them have given me any push back."
   
 Before the late 1980s, LSU had a holistic admissions policy. Under the rules now, colleges can make a number of exceptions to the normal admissions standards, but LSU came under fire for exceeding this number. Critics feared this would take prospective students from University of Louisiana system schools.
   
 LSU normally requires a 3.0, or B, grade-point average and a 25 on the ACT. Nicholls State University in Thibodaux requires at least a 2.0 grade-point average and 21 on the ACT.

Theologian Willie James Jennings reflects at length on the stakes of this question (“Caught up in God”). He describes the vexing choice that Western Christians face as our lives unfold in God and simultaneously in a culture marred by structural racial injustice. We hover between the joyful legacy of Jesus of Nazareth and the death-dealing idolatry of European Man, Jennings writes. We frequently fail to recognize the latter. Caught up in whiteness, we universalize it. We perform our lives toward its demands without interrogating or even seeing them.
 One of these demands is the marking of land in ways that create and preserve enclaves for whiteness. Jennings writes that in his youth, he knew that “certain areas of town were forbidden to me.” Such boundaries divide people by race; sometimes they lead to harm and even death. Arbery’s killing is connected to the way all of us view and occupy land.
 Jennings’s article inaugurates the return of a periodic _Century_ series called “How My Mind Has Changed.” Since 1939, the series has called attention to the importance—and complexity—of allowing our hearts and minds to be changed. Such changes can be sudden, prompted by a flash of insight or a recognition of error. Often they’re gradual, manifesting as subtle growth rather than a dramatic turnaround, a slow burn as the heart expands into the fullness of who God is calling us to be.
 What will it take to begin to untangle ourselves from the demands of whiteness and live more fully in the legacy of Jesus? It can’t be done overnight; it takes continual, deliberate work. As editors of a magazine that has too often universalized white experiences and neglected the voices of others, we know how hard it can be to change entrenched patterns. It requires recognizing and resisting the cultural forces that have long obscured our vision. It requires, as Jennings writes, the painful work of “thinking and feeling our way through the racial condition of the West.”
 It takes vulnerability to do this work, an openness to changes of mind and heart, and the help of the Spirit.
 _A version of this article appears in the print edition under the title “Changing minds and hearts.”_

JOHNS CREEK, Ga. — An old saying in show business has it that “the show must go on,” and that has certainly been the mentality of Chambers Performing Arts.
 For 40 years, the school has brought dance and performing arts classes to the North Fulton community. Now, although the studio is closed, Chambers students are continuing to take online classes and preparing for a virtual end-of-year show.
 Susan Chambers founded the school in 1980, then under the name Chambers School of Theatre Dance. Her daughter, Paige Chambers Rutsche, trained at the school and went on to appear in the Tony Award-winning Broadway show, "Crazy For You,” at age 17. After a career that included the national tours of “42nd Street,” “A Chorus Line,” and “Cats,” Chambers Rutsche returned to Johns Creek to run the school with her mother.
 The school offers the traditional dance classes — ballet, jazz, tap — and less conventional techniques — including musical theatre, hip hop and acro-dance. Students can also take vocal and acting lessons, preparing them to be true triple threats.
 “We start with Tiny Dancer and Me at 18 months old,” Chambers Rutsche said. “They come in and are introduced to rhythm and music with their parents or caretakers … all the way up to adults, sometimes in their 60s or 70s coming to take a tap class.”
 Chambers Performing Arts alumni have appeared in Broadway shows such as “The Producers” and “Anything Goes.” Some have joined the Radio City Rockettes and other top dance companies.
 Although these are not the circumstances in which they imagined they would celebrate their 40th anniversary, Chambers Rutsche said she is incredibly proud they have made it to this point.
 “I’m so proud of my family and my mom for keeping the vision going, and I hope we can keep it going through the next few months as we navigate through all this,” she said.
 When COVID-19 first forced the school to stop in-person lessons, the faculty filmed and edited more than 85 classes for students to view on-demand. Now, they have transitioned to a life class model, offering hundreds of classes a week through Zoom.
 “All of our teachers have done an amazing job,” Chambers Rutsche said. “What is blowing my mind is that we’ve had 99 percent attendance in all our classes. Our community has rallied to keep us open and keep us going.”
 Rutsch said she has been impressed with all their students who continue to show up in uniform, whether that’s a leotard and bun for ballet, sweatpants for hip hop, metal-plated shoes for tap, or for some students, all three in one day.
 “I’m just so proud of them,” she said. “To go through all this and still keep their commitments, keep their schedule, it’s incredible.”
 The school has also offered free classes in yoga, ballet and hip hop that anyone can take through Instagram, at instagram.com/chambersperformingarts/.
 “One of our hip teachers is from London, so when she taught the free Instagram live class, there were people from London logging in and taking the class,” Chambers Rutsche said. “One incredible thing about remote learning is truly anyone can do it from anywhere.”
 That includes Chambers Rutsche reaching out to her New York contacts and inviting Broadway casting directors, choreographers and performers to teach exclusive master classes during this time.
 Beyond lessons, the school has tried to maintain its sense of community by hosting virtual scavenger hunts and escape room parties.
 “The students have sent me so many emails saying, this is my life raft,” Chambers Rutsche said. “This is my anchor that keeps me grounded. It is such a family because you’re there all the time.”
 It is that tight-knit community that has kept the school going strong for 40 years, Chambers Rutsche said. She also credits the lasting vision of her mother and community support for the arts more broadly.
 “There’s just that need for the arts in people,” she said. “It’s something that you can’t get from anything else. We’ve seen major corporations go out of business through the years, and we’re still here.”

Our merchants did an excellent job of working with existing suppliers as well as expanding our sources of supply from new vendors, including those that service the restaurant industry. Our logistics and distribution teams worked around the clock to keep the goods flowing. Our front-line employees worked tirelessly to keep the shelves stocked and members happy and our support team in the home office met an ever- changing set of demands. While we expect the supply chain environment to remain challenging in the near-term in certain categories, we believe our systems, agility, and capacity should continue to serve us well.

 THREE years ago, Darren Johnstone and wife Sue were running their post office when Darren decided to take a gamble and turn to greyhound training.
 He came up trumps. The kennel has been racing dogs for just on two years and Johnstone has made amazing progress.
 He now sits atop the Ipswich male trainers’ premiership. He is fourth in the owner’s premiership having bought or bred most of his own dogs.
 It’s no fluke the kennel has broken out in 2020.
 Having been in business his whole life, Johnstone had a blueprint of where he wanted to get to from the start. He is ticking all the boxes so far.
 “Before I started training, I did my research went out and bought about a dozen pups,’’ Johnstone said.
 “A lot of those are in the prime of their careers now and have paid the bills.
 “I knew I had to grow and get owners and Kelly Waltisbuhl was the first to bring me dogs Truthiness, and Miss Imperious who have turned into two of my best dogs.
 “Having multiple winners every week and the race callers giving you a bit of a rap is a huge help. I just had two dogs come to the kennel this week from a new set of owners.
 “It’s good to know we’re starting to get a reputation.”
 Johnstone has a lot of love for all his dogs.
 Although the perennial placegetters provide the prize money to keep the machine ticking along, the trainer tipped a couple he thought had big futures, one over the sprint trip and one as a stayer.
 “I’m really excited about Molly Anne’s potential as a stayer,’’ he said. “She’s only had a dozen starts so I’d been holding her back from going further but last Saturday at Ipswich (630 metres) was the perfect starting point and she went out and got it done.
 “It’s not that she’s a bad 520 metre bitch. She’d won five of 12 over the shorts before Saturday. I just see all the traits in her to hopefully become my first successful stayer.”
 Johnstone is more than happy to keep Truthiness where he is. The winner of seven from 19 starts is not far away from Thursday night racing.
 “Truthiness was a 31 second dog around Ipswich when he was first racing and he’s just gradually got stronger and stronger,’’ the trainer said. “His most recent win there was in 30.58. He’s come a long way.
 “He won in good time at Capalaba on Sunday. Now he’s got a couple of fourth/fifth grades left at Ipswich and he’ll be off to Albion.”
 If you’re doing your form and see D. Johnstone in the book at Ipswich pay attention, because they just keep winning.
 Roy Baby relishes Queensland debut
 PARK Ridge trainer Tarquin Neil looks to have a good prospect in Roy Baby, the former NSW pup making a winning debut over the dashing 288 for the kennel, in good time too 17.03.
 Originally trained by Ricky Brewer at Richmond, the dog had two starts including one win at his home circuit. He has been off the scene for two months before his first up performance last Friday.
 Well-bred out of star stud dog Dyna Double One and Combined Effort a well performed bitch herself around NSW tracks, it’s well worth keeping an eye on his progress.
 Watershed win for Major Rose
 DARREN Russell’s bitch Major Rose started his career in a blaze of glory, smashing the 288m track record in a 16.58 eight length romp in August last year.
 There was plenty of chatter that the son of Magic Sprite and Trenty’s Rose could be anything, but it’s hard to live up to breaking a track record at start two.
 The dog won another few races over the short course until Russell was ready to step him up. He’s been an enigma ever since, sometimes brilliant other times just ordinary, but if was the good Major Rose who took out a hot fifth grade final over the 431 last Friday.
 The field featured the likes of Barcol Boy, Spring Curly, Aston Poker, Spring Cleo and race favourite and kennel mate Best Fit.
 Major Rose had only scraped into the final finishing fourth in his heat but was well backed late from the red.
 The money was right - second around the first turn and he took over from Spring Curly down the back holding a margin to the line, a good 25.18 clip.
 The dog’s seven wins have come in streaks and hopefully hitting the frame first can catapult his confidence going forward.
 President finds form at Ipswich
 THREE weeks ago, Capalaba president John Catton’s Jaydo’s Jet was a 13 start maiden. The Fernando Bale product always found at least one better in his 520m races at Albion Park and Ipswich.
 Searching for that elusive win, Catton dropped the dog back in trip to the 431m maiden heat on May 5. The Jet went straight to the front and got home in 24.96.
 Not only had he got the monkey off his back but the two-year-old had broken the 25 second barrier at his first time of asking, a time you’d likely see from chiselled veterans.
 He came back a week later and proved it was no fluke tearing them to bits by five and a half lengths in the final in a 24.99 gallop.
 As good as the pair of wins were, he got it all his own way from boxes one and two and was faced with the eight in Saturday night’s Novice.
 He flew the lids again but so did most of the field inside him leaving him posted four wide on the first turn. The dog showed great race sense not crashing for the fence, weaving his way through runners down the back.
 It looked like he would sit down to fight it out with Tony Brett’s speedy Buzzer Beater. But he went right on by to win by five lengths, the 25.32 time markedly slower but the performance much more impactful.
 Final Plea delivers
 WHEN Final Plea went .09 off the 395m Albion Park track record late last month, Justin Bowe declared the dog was ready to win at the 520 metres, which he did in dominant fashion last Saturday night.
 Missing the kick from box four the dog was able to recover and get to the rail on the first turn, the locally trained dog using all his local knowledge to take the shortest way home.
 He picked up about five runners from the post to the back straight, the race a no contest in the end as he surged away from Group Two Futurity winner Zipping Cosmo in 30.54.
 If the dog can bring his box manners with him for his 520 metre runs he’s going to be a force to be reckoned with going forward.

The original 2020 Super League schedule called for 29 rounds with teams each playing 28 games, 14 at home and 14 away. The Wolfpack, in their first year in the top-tier Super League, were slated to play 11 of their games at Lamport Stadium with three other "home" games to be played in England. The first game in Toronto was slated for April 18.
 The Wolfpack's final regular-season outing was originally slated for Sept. 11.
 Toronto will be hoping to stage games in Canada given the revenue from a home gate. The Wolfpack currently are not getting any revenue from the league's TV deal, a payout that normally covers the basic team salary cap of 2.1 million pounds ($3.6 million).
 With the schedule pushed back and spectators likely not allowed until October, Toronto would want as many home games as early as early before the Canadian winter sets in.
 Travel restrictions and quarantine demands would have to be lifted to make Canadian games happen.
 "There's a whole bunch of ducks that have got to get in a row before we actually get the green light," said Hunter.
 "Always the optimist, I believe that we can get still some games here. I think we owe it to our fans at some point to get to see (marquee signing) Sonny Bill (Williams)," he added.
 The Wolfpack entered the third tier of English rugby league in 2017, winning promotion to the second-tier Betfred Championship and then Super League.
 Super League is made up of 12 teams — 10 from England, Toronto and France's Catalan Dragons.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 21, 2020.

While we wait to hear whether the state will move to the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan later this month, we are being serenaded on all sides by a chorus of increasingly erratic voices.
 First, we have a few things to make clear. No one -- repeat, NO ONE -- actually enjoys that schools, businesses, concert venues, sports arenas, theaters and more have been forced to close in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. No one gets satisfaction from people’s livelihoods being torn apart. No one is happy to see their family, friends and neighbors struggle.
 No one.
 Even so, it seems more and more people are losing sight of that fact. A growing number of protesters and defenders of Pritzker’s stay-at-home order have taken their vitriol to hyperbolic extremes on social media, apparently casting aside any notion that we all are in this together. Supporters claim those opposing the governor’s orders just want others to die to keep themselves from being inconvenienced. Protesters claim those defending the order are trying to usher in Soviet-style communism. Neither group has shown any reluctance to make their attacks personal, stooping to name-calling and worse.
 Otherwise-respected members of this community have turned into children, hurling taunts at each other instead of listening to what their friends and neighbors have to say and working together to find a path forward.
 We are now less than two weeks from the possibility of moving to the next phase of the state’s plan on May 28. This is crucial time that could be spent making sure distancing recommendations will be followed, putting in place plans to reduce occupancy and keep safe once doors are opened.
 Instead of joining forces to make sure as many people and businesses are safe, however, the temptation of taunting one another on social media is leading too many astray.
 The options before us right now are basically three-fold. We can follow the plan and get ready to move forward later this month. We can try to take legal action against the state. Or we can act in open defiance of the order.

The Wolfpack (0-6-0) are currently on hiatus in England and have not played since March 11, when they blanked Huddersfield Giants 18-0 in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup.
 The Toronto team, meanwhile, confirmed the signing of England international back Kallum Watkins on a three-year deal. The signing had been reported last month, pending league approval.
 The Super League plan calls for games to resume in mid-August without spectators. The hope is matches after Oct. 1 can go ahead with limited crowds. Oct. 1 is nine days before the original date of the championship Grand Final, the 2020 season finale.
 The plan, reported by the BBC and confirmed by Wolfpack CEO and president Bob Hunter, is slated to go before the Rugby Football League board of directors next week.
 Hunter called the scenario "reasonably optimistic."
 The league is looking at different schedule models varying in the number of rounds — from nine to 15 — after Oct. 1. The Grand Final would be held either Nov. 28, Dec. 12 or mid-January depending on the model.
 Toronto opened regular-season play Feb. 2 this season.
 Players and team staff would return to action under a stringent testing COVID-19 protocol, for both training and games.
 "There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes," said Hunter.
 "But at the end of the day the government will decide," he added, referencing the return to action.
