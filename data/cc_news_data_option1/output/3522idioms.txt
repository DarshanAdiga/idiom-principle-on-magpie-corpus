 The big break came with a change in the weather. The forecast had called for more dry lightning, the kind that had set fires throughout California. But the storm missed us. And the fog rolled in from the coast and inland through the valley.
 Two days after they were evacuated, my daughter and her family and their neighbors got to go home. We were thrilled for them, and hoped we’d be next.
 Crews were spread thin with hundreds of fires around the state burning over a million acres. But they fought hard to keep the Carmel Fire from advancing to the Village.

 Eight days after leaving home, we were cleared to go back.
 Carmel Valley Road is a two-lane country highway cradled by rolling mountains, dotted with horse farms and vineyards and fields of wildflowers. Rush hour traffic is a herd of mule deer and a flock of wild turkeys. Those of us who know it well like to slow down and enjoy the ride.

The reality is some of you are going to have to move in the next few months. No, I don’t know something you don’t, it’s just the way of the world. Jobs change. Life throws us curveballs. Things just happen that force our hand. Let’s take a look at some of the reasons this is really a fantastic time to put your home on the market.
 The first and most important reason that now is a great time to sell is that buyer demand is finally back with a bit of gusto behind it. According to the National Association of Realtors’ pending home sales shot up 44.3 percent in May — the highest month-over-month jump since 2001.
 That’s a huge jump and a very encouraging number for those selling and buying. It is a great indication of the “world” opening back up a bit and buyers and sellers being more than ready to get back in the game.
 We always try to remind our readers that national statistics are not directly related to what is going on here in the Granite State. But one of the many positive trends we’re seeing with this increase in activity is the regions that are most affected.
 As people are now (finally) able to work more from home, employees are realizing they don’t need to live close to the office. This translates into a strong migration towards the suburbs and smaller, more remote cities.
 I have bounced around this country for thousands of miles and never missed a beat in running my business. We will most certainly see a trend in this shift away from the cities as more folks jump on board and head away from the dreaded concrete jungle.

VENICE, Italy, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Australian director Roderick MacKay braved COVID-19 restrictions to make a "daunting" trip to the Venice film festival, where his debut feature "The Furnace" premieres on Friday.
 MacKay had to get permission from Australian authorities to leave his own country, quarantine in Rome for two weeks before travelling to Venice, and will have to quarantine again when he goes back to Australia.
 "Travelling during this time in history is sort of just a little bit daunting for any purpose," 33-year old MacKay, who filmed a video of his journey and self-isolation on his mobile for Reuters, said in an interview.
 "But to be doing so, to come to a top tier festival like Venice, to have your debut film premiere on the world stage, it's certainly a whole other layer of dauntingness," he said, adding he was happy and honoured to be at the world's oldest film festival.
 "The Furnace", which is in the Horizon section outside the main competition, tells the little known story of cameleers brought to Australia by the British empire from India, Afghanistan and Persia in the second half of the 19th century and the local Aboriginal people they befriended.
 The Venice film festival is the first such international event to go ahead in front of live audiences since the coronavirus pandemic shut much of the movie world down. It runs until Sept 12. (Reporting by Hanna Rantala, Writing by Silvia Aloisi Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)

A North Dakota district judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the governor’s authority to shut down businesses during a pandemic.
 The hair salon at a Minot assisted living facility that sued over the matter in April plans to appeal to the state Supreme Court.
 “It’s essential that we all know that the governor has the power to do all of the things he’s doing,” plaintiffs’ attorney Lynn Boughey told the Tribune on Wednesday. “There’s a benefit to obtaining clarity. Obviously we hope we’re correct and we win, but this needs to be decided so there is no question going forward.”
 Gov. Doug Burgum in late March issued executive orders temporarily restricting or closing food and drink businesses, fitness centers, and personal care services such as hair salons to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Burgum allowed the orders to expire in early May.
 Somerset Court LLC and salon operator Kari Riggin sued Burgum and then-State Health Officer Mylynn Tufte in April in an effort to allow the facility’s in- house hair salon to continue providing services to residents. They asserted that Burgum’s orders went beyond his authority and denied plaintiffs their constitutional right to earn a living.
 The attorney general’s office argued on behalf of the state that the governor has both constitutional and statutory authority to manage disasters and emergencies, including temporarily restricting certain businesses. The state asked that the case be dismissed.
 South Central District Judge Daniel Borgen in a ruling filed Tuesday granted that request.
 “The Court concludes the disputed executive orders did not exceed the Governor’s constitutional and statutory authority in this case,” he wrote. “The challenged executive orders were a proper exercise of the state’s police powers delegated by the legislature, and the Governor’s and the State’s authority to manage public emergencies.”
 Burgum in April said opening up in-house hair salons at assisted living facilities conflicted with his plans to protect vulnerable populations. His spokesman, Mike Nowatzki, on Wednesday told the Tribune in a statement that “The governor is pleased with the ruling and will continue to exercise his authority under the North Dakota Disaster Act with great care and discretion to protect the health, safety and well-being of North Dakotans during this pandemic.”
 Boughey doesn’t consider the matter settled. He points to a May analysis of Burgum’s executive orders by the Legislative Council, the Legislature’s research arm, that Boughey feels casts doubt about the orders’ legitimacy.
 The analysis concluded that the governor is authorized to issue executive orders during a disaster or emergency but that the order in question “outlines numerous mandatory standards for specific industries that may exceed that authority.”
 The Legislative Council’s memorandum also states that “the North Dakota Supreme Court has not defined or addressed the limit or extent to which (state law) may be used by the governor during a state-declared disaster or emergency.”
 Boughey said, “I think it’s important if not essential that the North Dakota Supreme Court decide what the governor’s authority is in reference to these health-related issues.”
 The Somerset Court salon continued operating after Burgum’s order. Riggin, an independent contractor, was cited on April 14 for failing to comply with the order. The infraction carries a potential fine up to $1,000.
 A hearing in that case is scheduled Thursday in state district court in Minot. Boughey said he’d like the judge to rule quickly so that if Riggin loses that case, he can appeal both the criminal and the civil cases to the Supreme Court at the same time.

PEORIA -- The clock is ticking on the ice-making system in Carver Arena.
   
 It is nearing the end of its lifespan, an ongoing issue of which both the Peoria Rivermen and landlord Peoria Civic Center are aware.
   
 The present system was put in during the mid-1990s, and over the last couple seasons has had malfunctions that have washed out the color on the ice, left long dark streaks and left the SPHL team playing on a cosmetically poor surface, cost thousands of dollars for the facility to quick-fix and left a looming threat of a more severe breakdown halting a season.
   
 The Civic Center has won a $25 million grant from the state for capital improvements in the facility -- a gift from the gods, if you will -- and certainly the ice-making setup is among the items on a long to-do list.
   
 "The ice facility, we don't know what will happen with that yet," Civic Center Authority Board chairman Matt Bartolo said. "We came up with an extensive list of what to spend that $25 million on. It is definitely in that list.
   
 "But we have not received the first dollars from the state yet. What we're able to do, and when, will be dictated by when the state gives us these grants."
   
 A new ice system at Carver Arena is estimated to cost somewhere between $2-3.5 million. It'll have a 20-30 year lifespan if all goes well. And it will be a must-have for the Civic Center if it wants to maintain an elite profile as a venue, and be home to its 39-year professional hockey team as a tenant. Not to mention the ability to book future ice-related events, like Disney On Ice shows.
   
 "I would say the ice plant will be part of the discussion with our committee that is going to handle these capital improvements," Civic Center general manager Rik Edgar said. "We think the ice system at Carver Arena will get us through one more season. Possibly two.
   
 "Is there a long-term agreement with the team? If we're going to spend that kind of money, is the team staying with us?
   
 "Those are all things that will be considered by our committee when the time comes."
   
 In other words, the Rivermen would like to see a new ice-making plant installed before they agree to a longer-term lease deal.
   
 And the Civic Center would like to see a longer-term lease deal before it commits to replacing the ice-making plant.
   
 The Rivermen opened Carver Arena in 1982 as its first sports event. The arena was designed for hockey, with its sightlines and space. Over the years various NHL scouts and executives have come into the building and lauded it as a scaled-down big-league venue.
   
 It would be hard to imagine Carver Arena without the Rivermen, and the collateral economic boost their fans provide to the downtown economy.
   
 And it would be hard to believe city officials would let a community asset like the Rivermen leave downtown, or a facility like the Civic Center be diminished.
   
 "We are well aware of the issue facing our organization at the Peoria Civic Center with the ice plant that is beyond its life expectancy being able to operate efficiently," Rivermen co-owner Bart Rogers said. "Our players, fans and sponsors have seen the issues first hand the last few years with the challenges the Peoria Civic Center has been up against, keeping it operational for our franchise to be able to play games on while also practicing throughout each season.
   
 "The Civic Center has worked hard and done its best to keep that ice system operating. Rivermen hockey is one of the longest continually operating minor league hockey franchises in all of North America, something that is a legacy in central Illinois we're all proud of. ... we want to continue that trend for another four decades, but without a functioning ice plant, the Rivermen have no other home or ice facility in town with a large enough capacity to make the franchise financially sustainable.
   
 "Hopefully, with this capital improvement grant from the state, the Civic Center can help assure the community's pro hockey team will have a home."

NOTE: The interviews for this Somerset Berkley Regional field hockey story were conducted Tuesday night, before the South Coast Conference had voted on Monday to cancel its fall 2020 sports seasons. Somerset Berkley Regional has opted to follow suit and to move fall sports to the newly-created Fall II wedge season (late winter, early spring). Playoffs technically, are still possible, after the Fall II season. The MIAA's existing no-tournament decree pertains only to the fall season.
 SOMERSET - On the positive side, Somerset Berkley Regional's reign as state Division 1 field hockey challenge is secure for another season.
 But there will be no three-peat, or even an attempt at three-peat, in 2020. That possibility was erased when the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, in response to COVID-19 fears, decreed that while most traditional fall sports were approved to compete this fall, the MIAA would not sponsor fall state tournaments.
 Somerset Berkley has won the previous two state Division 1 field hockey championships.
 "It's sad," said head coach Jen Crook on Tuesday. "But I'm just hoping for a season this year. Anything at this point is better than nothing."
 "It's hard to be motivated," said junior quad-captain Lauren Rothwell, a two- year starter.
 For most of 2018 and for all of 2019, the regular season was simply a prolonged tuneup for the Raiders, who went undefeated last season and have experienced one loss and no ties over the last seasons. The serious competition has come in state tournament time.
 "No playoffs is very disappointing," said senior Cami Crook, who last year verbally committed to Providence College for field hockey, "because that's, honestly, where we shine the most. Or at least the past few years, that's where we have shined the most. So it's kind of disappointing that we only get maybe not even a full regular season. I'm kind of upset about that. But at least we get a season."
 "It's really upsetting because, obviously, playoffs is kind of what we really thrived on the past few years, and that's been the most exciting part of the season," said senior quad-captain Kayleigh McDonald, a four-year starter on defense. "But I'm excited about the possibility of being able to play at all because there was a point in time when we didn't know if we'd be able to."
 PROVING THEMSELVES
 Somerset Berkley field hockey is traditionally a motivated group. That motivation may have been turned up extra high this season. SBR graduated nine seniors from a year ago. Seven of those seniors were starters. Among them were stars Lucas Crook (55 goals, 33 assists), defender Alexander Millar and defender Janey Silvia.
 "Everyone thinks we only won because of the boys," said Cami Crook (49 goals, 47 assists in 2019), one of the elite players in the state. "But I wanted the season to prove everyone on the team's skilled, so maybe we can win again, or just have a good season."
 "We were still excited for a possible playoff run this year," McDonald said.
 OH, THOSE RULE CHANGES
 The MIAA instituted very significant rules modifications for field hockey teams wishing to compete this fall. Introduced to reduce physical contact among players, the modifications include reducing the on-field competition from 11-on-11 to 7-on-7 and the elimination of penalty corners, which frequently produce high-quality scoring chances. SBR was lethal on penalty corners the last two seasons. It's comparable to reducing or eliminating power plays in ice hockey.
 After watching her brother Lucas, Millar and Silvia serve as penalty corner hitters the last two years, Cami Crook was likely going to get a shot at that role this season.
 The 7-on-7 format is also a game changer.
 "You don't have to be skilled. You just have to have endurance," Coach Crook said. "You have to have speed. And your defense, they're not going to be very disciplined because the worst that happens is the ball gets brought back to the 25 with a long hit going in."
 It's debatable to what degree 7-on-7 will affect overall playing time. While fewer players will be on the field at once, players will be doing more and longer sprinting, while wearing masks, resulting in more fatigue. That would lead to an increase in substituting.
 Cami Crook's eye brightened, just a bit, when she was asked about 7-on-7. She has strong endurance to go with amazing stickhandling skills and good speed. An uncrowded field would serve as a canvas for a field hockey artist.
 READY TO PLAY
 Coach Crook and her players interviewed for this story were all in favor of playing restricted field hockey in the fall rather than rolling the dice with Fall II. The coach noted the significant logistical challenges in Fall II, with football (designated for Fall II), field hockey and girls' and boys' soccer competing for practice time on the one artificial turf field in situations where the natural turf fields might be covered by snow, frozen or muddy.
 "I would say field hockey now, because that's what we're used to," Cami Crook said. "Ever since I was a freshman, I've been looking forward to my senior year in the fall."

Triple-threat Radha Blank wrote, directed, and stars in _The Forty-Year-Old Version,_ a semi-autobiographical comedy about a playwright in New York City. The black-and-white film is her directorial debut and follows Blank as a 40-year-old wrestling with not living up to her spot on a 30-under-30 list from a decade ago. As she contends with teaching bratty teenagers who make her feel like a failure, she decides to reinvent herself as a rapper and live out her dreams. She embarks on an amusing journey to craft a mixtape and make a name for herself as RadhaMUSPrime. Blank teamed up with Emmy-winner Lena Waithe who also produced the movie, and earlier this year, the film earned Blank an award for best direction at the Sundance Film Festival.

But not once was Marshall listed among the candidates for divisional or conference championships.
 So, is this another here-we-go-again moment?

 “We just tried to get some guys recognition,” he said. “They deserve it. That’s the one thing that is voted on by the coaches, so I didn’t have anything to do with that. The rest of the coaches in the league thought they were good players and made those votes.
 “It doesn’t really matter where you are now. It matters more at the end of the season. Those guys have all got to step up and have great years, which they are all tremendous young people as well as players. So I know they are looking forward to the season.”
 Who isn’t?
 In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the mere idea of Marshall playing a college football game against Eastern Kentucky at 1 p.m. Saturday in Joan C. Edwards Stadium is an extremely refreshing thought.
 So go ahead and breathe a sigh of relief.
 There’s no question that everybody has earned that, yet a question does indeed linger in the air about how this season is going to play out.
 Will the 2020 team be better than the 2019 squad? Will this edition of the Herd post the “must wins” the 2019 team squandered? Namely, can Marshall defeat Western Kentucky, Middle Tennessee, Charlotte and FIU in 2020?
 That’s what needs to happen if Marshall is going to advance to C-USA postseason play.
 At least Marshall will get off to a good start.
 The Herd will cruise past EKU 38-13.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that he won't allow the Pentagon to cut funding for the military's independent newspaper, Stars and Stripes, effectively halting Defense leaders plan to shut the paper down this month.
 "The United States of America will NOT be cutting funding to @starsandstripes magazine under my watch," Trump tweeted. "It will continue to be a wonderful source of information to our Great Military!"
 Trump's tweet came as he fought off new accusations that he called service members killed in World War I "losers" and "suckers" during an event in France in 2018. The comments, first reported by The Atlantic and confirmed by The Associated Press, are shining a fresh light on Trump's previous public disparaging of American troops and military families and they delivered a new campaign issue to his Democrtic rival Joe Biden, less than two months from Election Day.
 The Defense Department's has ordered the paper to halt publication by Sept. 30, and dissolve the organization by the end of January. The order, in a recent memo to Stripes, follows the Pentagon's move earlier this year to cut the $15.5 million in funding for the paper from the Defense Department budget. And it is a reflection of the Trump administration's broader animosity for the media and members of the press.
 The Trump White House hadn't spoken out against the Pentagon plan to close the paper before today, even though it's been in the works and publicly written about for months. On Friday, howeve, Trump worked to shore up his reputation as a staunch supporter of the nation's armed services.
 "I've done more for the military than almost anyone else," he said Friday in the Oval Office.
 Trump was alleged to have made the comments about the war dead as he was set to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery during a trip to France in Nov. 2018.
 Members of Congress have objected to the defunding move for months. And senators sent a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper this week urging him to reinstate the money. The letter, signed by 15 senators — including Republicans and Democrats — also warns Esper that the department is legally prohibited from canceling a budget program while a temporary continuing resolution to fund the federal government is in effect.
 "Stars and Stripes is an essential part of our nation's freedom of the press that serves the very population charged with defending that freedom," the senators said in the letter.
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in a separate letter to Esper in late August, also voiced opposition to the move, calling Stripes "a valued 'hometown newspaper' for the members of the Armed Forces, their families, and civilian employees across the globe." He added that "as a veteran who has served overseas, I know the value that the Stars and Stripes brings to its readers."
 In the memo, the department says Esper made the decision as a result of his department-wide budget review. Signed by Army Col. Paul Haverstick, acting director of the Pentagon's Defense Media Activity, the memo says plans to close the paper are due on Sept. 15 and the last newspaper is to be published on Sept. 30.
 The memo adds that if the paper continues to be funded by either a continuing resolution "or other unforeseen circumstances" then Stripes must submit a plan by Sept. 15 to shut down at the end of the next budget year, Sept. 30, 2021. Haverstick's memo says that in that case, the last date for publication of the newspaper will be determined based on budget or other circumstances.
 The Stripes ombudsman, Ernie Gates, told The Associated Press on Friday that shutting the paper down "would be fatal interference and permanent censorship of a unique First Amendment organization that has served U.S. troops reliably for generations."
 The first newspaper called Stars and Stripes was very briefly produced in 1861 during the Civil War, but the paper began consistent publication during World War I. When the war was over, publication ended, only to restart in 1942 during World War II, providing wartime news written by troops specifically for troops in battle.
 Although the paper gets funding from the Defense Department, it is editorially independent and is delivered in print and digitally to troops all over the world.
 The Pentagon proposed cutting the paper's funding when making its budget request earlier this year, triggering angry reactions from members of Congress.
 The House-passed version of the Pentagon budget contains funding for the paper's publication, but the Senate has not yet finalized a defense funding bill.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - More than 30 million unemployed Americans were dealt another blow when their $600 in weekly Supplemental Federal Unemployment Benefits ended at the end of July.But now an executive memorandum is extending unemployment benefits to some Alabamians, but it’s not as much money.LaTanya McCaslin received a check Friday morning after not receiving benefits for nearly a month. But that check was only $300, which is making it tough for her to make ends meet.Alabama is among 45 states that submitted applications and plans to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. FEMA has taken on the task of dispersing money from the Disaster Relief Fund. You must have been receiving regular unemployment assistance in order to qualify for the supplemental federal benefits.McCaslin said she is grateful to be getting that money, but she admits it is getting harder to stay on top of her bills.“It’s been quite an ordeal. With the $600 stimulus I was able to catch up on my bills I was even able to go the extra mile and start stocking up and start saving. Now, since we have the $300 stimulus, I’m sort of taking two steps back I’m playing catch up again and what I did save I’m finding myself having to dip into that,” McCaslin explained.McCaslin is hoping to be able to return to her job at the Sheraton sometime in October.Meanwhile, FEMA is only guaranteeing three weeks of funding. After that, the agency said any additional disbursements will be made on a weekly basis to ensure enough money is available for other states.Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

 SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept 4 (Reuters) - The day California finally allowed hair salons to reopen after months of pandemic restrictions should have been a happy one for the sisters who own Hourglass Salon + Boutique in Sacramento. Instead, they spent it hauling out boxes and figuring out how to tell customers they were closing.
 "Our hearts are shattered," Erin Banville and Melissa Burgoon wrote to clients.
 The popular business faced thousands of dollars in rent payments, and the state's order allowing hair salons to serve customers indoors came days too late.
 Nationwide, half of small businesses said sales were down by 25% or more in August from pre-pandemic levels, according to a survey of 20,000 companies by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).
 Twenty-one percent said they would not be able to stay afloat for more than six months, and another 19% said they would not make it if current conditions lasted for another year. Five percent said they would not be able to make it another two months.
 Hardest hit are retail, travel, hospitality, and business and personal services companies, said Holly Wade, the NFIB's director of research. The problems go beyond states' temporary closure orders or business restrictions. Consumers have changed their habits, ordering retail goods and food online, working from home and fearing to patronize many businesses in person out of health concerns, she said.
 With so many people working from home, small businesses that cleaned office buildings have had little or no work for months, Wade said, while restaurants have had to downsize and retool to offer food to go.
 "It's been an incredibly challenging situation for many of our small businesses," said Marni Sanders, chief executive of the Yuba Sutter Chamber of Commerce, which serves an area north of Sacramento. "They were not equipped for something like this. They didn't have reserves, they were essentially living from paycheck to paycheck."
 Jeff Rossman, who owns two restaurants in San Diego, was breaking even earlier in the pandemic after retooling to handle mostly orders to go, requiring fewer employees, and participating in a state program to feed seniors. But reopening for indoor dining with restrictions on capacity would still be too expensive.
 "It's going to be touch and go for a while, and I think you're going to see a lot of restaurants closing," Rossman said.
 Denise Duncan, the owner of AT Industrial Products, which makes equipment to clean up combustible dust from metals used in manufacturing, said orders have dropped by half due to the double-whammy of a cyclical turndown and plummeting demand as the pandemic impacts clients' production and needs.
 "I might have 90 days before I gotta figure out how to shut it down and move on," she said.
 Like other small business owners, Duncan is hoping Congress expands the Paycheck Protection Program, which helped many small businesses keep up with payroll expenses during the pandemic's early days.
 To be sure, some sectors of the economy are booming. Construction and home improvement companies are busy upgrading homes and gardens as people focus on their live-work spaces and low interest rates spur home sales.
 A Reuters analysis showed that demand is up for grocery items as people work from home and cook more. But demand for products and services used by office- workers is down, from business clothing to takeout coffee.
 Christopher Thornberg, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting at the University of California, Riverside, said the pandemic and accompanying business and social restrictions accelerated changes already pressuring some businesses, particularly brick-and-mortar stores.
 But many businesses will ultimately recover, he said. Women still want to get their hair done, so the salon industry will come back.
 Such optimism offered little solace to Banville and Burgoon as they shut down Hourglass, packing hair products into boxes and pulling out the jewelry, blouses and dresses that Burgoon sold from a boutique tucked into the salon's waiting room.
 A day after California said it would allow salons to reopen for indoor services, Banville started seeing clients in a room she rented in a group working space. Burgoon was looking for a job she could do as a mom with two young children.
 "We were thriving," Banville said of the salon, where stylists were often booked months in advance. "This is a decision that was made for us." (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; editing by Bill Tarrant and Leslie Adler)

She loved the quiet solitude of the trail, and wanted to go back and finish the section she missed, plus revisit some beautiful places again. This July 21, exactly two years to the day that she “completed” the Cohos Trail, she returned, spending four days and three nights on the trail and walking approximately 45 miles.
 Berrier is a neighbor of mine in Tamworth. I wrote a hiking column about her hike in 2018, and we agreed it would be fun to do another about her return to the Cohos Trail this year.
 With a 38-pound pack, she started up the Starr King Trail in Jefferson. She had individual dry dinners that she had prepared, and other trail essentials for four days on her own. Unlike her longer first hike on the trail, when she brought a GPS satellite messenger that noted her location on the trail, and sent out the data each day to 10 family members, she relied on texting and her phone from high points to keep people updated on her progress.
 She met people doing the popular trail up Mount Starr King and the 4,006-foot Mount Waumbek. But continuing north on the Kilkenny Ridge Trail towards the three summited Mount Weeks, “there was not a soul in sight.” This trend continued. On popular mountains she met people, but the majority of the time she had the wilderness to herself.
 There were challenges. “The Cohos Trail is not a beginner trail,” she noted. “The trail is not heavily used and sometimes not clear.” Close to the top of Mount Weeks, she made her way around a blow down and couldn’t find the trail again, so she bushwhacked to the summit, visible just above.
 She took a spur trail to a tent site on Mount Weeks that was frequently used by Cohos Trail thru-hikers. But she never met one.
 The next morning, she descended to Willard Notch and climbed Terrace Mountain. Looking north from its summit, her next objective, Mount Cabot, looked very close. But she had to descend the deep and muddy Brunnell Notch before climbing Cabot.
 Passing the Mount Cabot Cabin before the summit, she was on familiar ground. From Mount Cabot she descended a ridge to the tent site at Unknown Pond, first stopping at the famous viewpoint call the Horn, where the vast Killkenny Region she had just traversed spread out below.
