A pediatrician credited for helping bring modern children's care to Jacksonville has retired after serving area families for more than 50 years.


   


  Dr. Charles Martin has put an emphasis on getting to know his patients and personalizing their care. With something as important as health, it shouldn't be left to a stranger, he said.


   


  "He just had such a wonderful reputation in the area it was really a no brainer to go see him as a child," said Deke Owens, a 48-year-old who continued seeing Martin into adulthood. "He has an amazing ability to connect with people which is why he has so many patients like myself that started seeing him at a very, very young age as a child and ultimately never leave him."


   


  Martin first started practicing medicine in Jacksonville in 1968. The Wilmington native settled in the city after attending undergraduate and medical school at Duke University, serving at Fort Bragg as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division and interning at the University of Alabama hospital.


   


  The now 83-year-old and his wife had several children, including their late son Dr. Charles Martin Jr., who followed his father's footsteps and became a pediatrician.


   


  "I've had such a unbelievably good life, and I think the joy of pediatrics is that you have so few deaths," Martin said. "With good care and God's help, it's by far the easiest type of general practice."


   


  When Martin first opened his clinic, there was only one other pediatrician in Onslow County. Most of the area children were being seen by general practitioners, of which there were only about 14 in the county, Martin said.


   


  Business was slow the first year, but by his fifth year he was seeing 50 to 90 patients per day. On his busiest day in 1974 he saw 120 patients.


   


  "I wanted to try to get the county back into the century," Martin said. "Medicine, it was behind in the county when I got back here because I was used to doing many, many more invasive things than what was being done here."


   


  His legacy, he said, was bringing more intensive care to the youngest of infants who needed help breathing.


   


  When he first arrived, babies were being put in isolettes (a clear plastic enclosed crib that maintains a warm environment for a new baby and isolates him or her from germs) and if they needed oxygen they were given it by mask or a tube that was placed into their isolette.


   


  Martin changed that by developing a critical care nursery where he introduced blood gasses to help evaluate an infant's respiratory function and purchased air shields and ventilators.


   


  After Martin founded the Jacksonville Children's Clinic where he served as CEO and CFO until about a decade ago when the two parted ways, he helped develop a true neonatal unit for critical care of premature newborns, including a neonatologist and neonatal nurse.


   


  "He's a staple in this community and has been," Owens said "He's just been around here forever and connected so many generations of people. He has an amazing ability to read people and understand them and therefore to connect with them and what they're going through."


   


  Owens' mother took him to see Martin as a young child, and as Owens aged, he decided to continue being a patient, bringing his wife and three children into the practice as well.


   


  At all hours of the night, Martin would be willing to take Owens calls, and sometimes would even meet the Owens family to treat the kids at his office in the middle of night, Owens said.


   


  From the time Putt Browning was born, he was also a patient of Martin. Browning's father and Martin are cousins, and though Browning isn't technically Martin's nephew, he still calls the doctor Uncle Bud.


   


  After Browning moved away for college and opened an orthodontic office in Wilmington, he would still call Martin for advice for his own children.


   


  Other adults in their 30s to 50s that Browning knows still call Martin as well. If a doctor gives them advice on a procedure or treatment for an illness, it's second nature to call Martin and get his blessing before proceeding, Browning said.


   


  Retirement will likely be filled with many more calls from former patients looking for medical advice, Browning said.


   


  "A lot of times when you see a doctor, like I've seen specialists, an orthopedic doctor, someone for other types of things. Sometimes you feel rushed … obviously they're incredibly busy," Owens said. "But he takes the time with his patients and you don't leave there until you fully understand and you're on board with the treatment plan."


   


  Martin partially retired a few years ago when he sold 99% of Martin's Pediatric and Family Care to Paula Faye, the nurse practitioner who worked with him. He continued working a couple days a week and when Faye was away for vacation until he fully retired in February, Martin said.


   


  In retirement, Martin said he'll enjoy his woodworking hobbies, including building desks, tables, snowmen and cutting boards. He'll also work in his greenhouse and grow vegetables.


   


  His extensive travels, including yearly trips to Aruba, and several journeys to climb the world's tallest mountains will also continue, he said.


   


  "Walking down the mall at Christmas time and having children run up to you … there's a joy in pediatrics," Martin said. "I feel honored that God has given me 83 years and certainly a life of so many hugs and just the enjoyment of watching children grow."
