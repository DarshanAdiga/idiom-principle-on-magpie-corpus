“I came to Paradise in 1981 from the Bay Area to visit an old high school friend. I was down and out, nearly homeless having lost contact with family at the end of 30 years addicted to drugs and alcohol. Paradise is the place and time when I had an awakening and sobered up and began a new way of life. As a result of that and the loving support of this community Paradise became my forever home. For me, even long before the Camp Fire, it became a place of rebirth and renewal and that is why I started trying to give back to my town.”

 Sevilla won’t be in next season’s Europa League, at least not at first. Its fourth-place finish in La Liga was good enough to qualify for a Champions League group-stage place, even without the spot on offer for the Europa League winner.
 It was the 238th and last Sevilla game for midfielder Ever Banega, who won his third Europa League title and now heads to Saudi Arabia next season.
 Banega signed off in style, swinging in the free kick for de Jong to head in Sevilla’s second goal. He also struck the free kick which indirectly led to the winner. Inter failed to clear, allowing Diego Carlos to hit an overhead kick which Inter forward Romelu Lukaku diverted into his own net.

However, the administration has yet to be truly “maximum” in its approach. The U.S. needs to pursue a more regional strategy against Iran’s destabilizing behavior, given the inherently regional nature of Iran’s aspirations. The U.S. posture in the Middle East has shrunk over time, meaning that most aspects of maximum pressure are applied locally to Iran. Now, with the Islamic Republic’s favorite proxy under fire, the U.S. has a chance to hit Iran where it hurts most.

During Monday’s special session of the Idaho Legislature, legislators will be asked to decide if Idaho should have a policy that provides immunity from a civil lawsuit for those who make a good faith effort to continue to operate safely during a disaster or pandemic. IACI strongly encourages support of the legislation.
 In order to move back to economic health and/or open schools and businesses, the threat of lawsuits during a pandemic in Idaho is extremely disruptive. Employers, schools and governments that are doing their best to do the right thing deserve some protection from legal liability in the face of unprecedented challenges. The citizens need these protections provided by the Idaho Legislature to be able to completely reopen the economy. Employers and schools should not have to operate in fear of lawsuits from their customers and students.

Let’s be clear on what the legislation does not do. The legislation does not apply to those who are being reckless or intentionally harm someone in their efforts. This legislation will not impact worker’s compensation. This legislation will not shield federal or national governments.
 This legislation will provide a shield for school districts, churches and employers that are acting in good faith to comply with the law and provide safe places to learn, work, shop and worship. IACI member businesses that are keeping the lights on, the water running, the food on the shelves, and the lumber supplies to rebuild are helping Idaho recover. They’re not only critical to Idaho; they’re critical to the nation. Without this important legislation, the livelihood of thousands of Idahoans is under threat by opportunistic trial lawyers. Contact your local legislators (208-332-1000) and let them know you want them to do the right thing and vote in support of this crucial bill.

Location makes a big difference. Some states have a low cost of living and affordable housing to make it easier to attract workers, while others have tax-friendly policies to make entrepreneurship easier. Some have a shortage of available and able workers, while others have a growing, well-educated labor pool. Overall, the goal for most startups is to find an affordable location that will provide access to skilled workers as well as plenty of resources to get a business up and running.

I wrote _My Name Is Leon_ with no expectation of it being published. After all, the first two novels I had written were rejected out of hand. They were crime-ish, underworld stories culled and fashioned from my many years of working in criminal law. But I was told they fell between “literary” and “genre” and I had no idea what that meant – and more importantly I didn’t know how to fix them. The disappointment was crushing. I often hear people tell authors who have had their work rejected to get on and write something else and just keep going. I disagree. If you’ve put your heart and soul into something and really think that this might be it, you should allow yourself some time to grieve. The loss is real. And sometimes things are unfixable. So, tuck into the ice-cream, rant against the world and just be bloody well sad about it.

Time for a lightning round - or if you prefer, another series of short articles and stuff from the 1923 newspapers - just to give you a hint of local colour on these dogs days of August…


  Let us start shall we with a wee bit of national news.


  On Jan. 1, 1923, the Government of Canada decreed that all receipts over $10 must carry a two-cent stamp (ergo, a two cent tax). Payroll receipts, receipts for mortgages and legacies and taxes, individual freight bills and statements of same, as well as a receipt acknowledging payment, and also insurance policies and custom house brokers were subject to the new rules. A vigorous general public outcry made sure that cash register receipts and bills of sale were not included in the new tax. Violation of the new law meant a $100 fine. So, if you are cleaning out any old drawers or boxes inherited from your grandfather, and you come across old payroll receipts, that would be why there is a stamp or two attached to it.


  I can't pass up this little gem from the Cobalt Nugget - so just remember that in 1923 we were all supposed to be following the Temperance Act. "The Northern News paints a hideous picture of the whiskey-gurgling, wine-bibbing and drinking of Hoffman drops during Christmas week. Weekend conditions on the streets of Cobalt were a blot on the famed name of this town. Men, reeling helplessly under the influence of intoxicating liquor, made the night air hideous with foul-mouthed blasphemy and with filthy language they would have been ashamed to use in their sober senses… It is impossible for the town's one-man police force to cope with any such state of affairs as existed last weekend, but the town council might do many worse things than expend some of the $5,000 surplus in clearing the streets of these drunks."


  Much to the delight of local shoppers and bargains seekers, F.W. Woolworth opened a store in the Gordon Block on Third Avenue. The store opened for "public inspection" on Jan. 19 from 2 to 5 p.m. and again from 7 to 9 p.m.


  Brown's orchestra would provide music and goodies would be served - but no goods would be sold at that time. The store would officially open on Jan. 20 at 8:30 a.m. with a promise that nothing would cost more than 15 cents (after all, Woolworth's was the original five and dime shop).


  Some of the opening day bargains included men silk four-in-hand ties, kitchens aprons, writing envelopes and paper, ladies' fleece lined vests, 54-inch brass curtain rods, earthenware teapots and iron frying pans. It was later reported that the opening drew record crowds for such an event and that "the large staff of clerks were rushed to the limit. 'Have you been to Woolworth's' was a regular sort of greeting among the residents."


  So much for the joys of childhood - the Timmins Public School (later known as Central School, which was located on the site now occupied by The 101 Mall), announced it had room to create a new class- kindergarten/primary - and accepted 40 little ones for the honour. Mrs. Twaddle (no offense intended, but doesn't that sound like the perfect name for a kindergarten teacher?) took charge of the first class. Mr. Carter presided as principal.


  And for the intellectuals in the crowd, the Caledonian Society of Timmins offered an evening's entertainment featuring a lecture by Mr. M. B. Scott entitled "The Scottish Condition at the time of Waterloo" (I hope he was an entertaining speaker), followed by a literary programme (no details) and music suitable for dancing (read jigs and reels). The Caledonia Club met regularly at the IOOF Hall on Friday evenings; the club was opened to all local residents of Scottish descent.


  The police docket for Feb. 7th uncovered the following cases. Five men were charged $5 each for gambling at the Timmins Cafe on Cedar Street. A specially designed gaming table was seized from the premises and the owner of the cafe was charged $50 for his trouble. Steve Barinka was fined $25 for daring to hold a dance on a Sunday (in contravention of the Lord's Day Act, which strictly forbade all sorts of things including dancing). Two weeks later he would be charged again for assaulting his brother-in-law on a Sunday. A gentleman was fined $10, plus costs, plus $12.50 in damages, for being drunk and breaking a window on Elm Street.


  The Victorian Order of Nurses was prepared to set up a chapter in Timmins in February 1923. Dr. MacInnis was elected the first chairman. Miss Boswell, a nurse of good standing, was sent to the community to talk about the organization and its role. The VON started out in 1897 as a memorial for the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria. The organization focused primarily on public health issues and helping the poor. The VON provided nursing services in the community for many who could not afford to pay for regular nurses.


  They also worked with new and expectant mothers. Putting aside all good intentions, the VON would have to wait until 1926 to set up shop in Timmins. Funds were slow in coming from the province but help from the Timmins Kiwanis Club finally got the show on the road - not a bad investment, I'd say, as the group continues its work in the community today.


  And finally, I can't end without a Timmins council story. A new town bylaw expressly forbade taxis from stopping within 90 feet of Pine Street and Third Avenue to either let off or accept riders, because it could tie up traffic (I can't imagine that traffic jams in 1923 were THAT big of a problem).


  Taxis were also forbidden to honk their horns unless it was an emergency (taxis tooted their horns to drum up business - I can see where that would get old pretty fast). However, no definition was provided for what constituted an emergency - although might I suggest that an emergency might perhaps feature an angry customer who couldn't get off on Pine Street because it would cause a traffic snarl that would take all of two minutes to clear up?

New Hampshire citizens made great sacrifices this past March to flatten the curve of COVID-19. We did this to protect healthcare workers and buy time for the state and federal government to develop coherent response plans. Gov. Sununu has not only squandered this time, he has actively undermined efforts to protect the people of this state.


  He vetoed extending family and medical leave for COVID, vetoed protecting workers during the coronavirus pandemic, vetoed providing COVID funds to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, vetoed raising the minimum wage, vetoed eviction protections. In fact, he has issued 22 vetoes this session. Instead of spearheading a coherent statewide plan for opening schools safely, he punted the issue to school districts, many of which don’t have adequate resources in the best of times. He has not issued a statewide mask mandate.


  Who is going to pay for his lack of leadership? Workers, students, elderly, people with health problems, small businesses, schools and communities.


  We need a new leader. I will be voting for Andru Volinsky on Sept. 3. As executive councilor, he has been fighting to make our state safer and our schools more fairly funded. As governor, he will be fighting for all of New Hampshire’s citizens.

With Paris Saint-Germain looking to become only the second French club to win the Champions League, around 3,000 police will be deployed on the Champs- Élysées and outside the club’s stadium on Sunday night to prevent wild fan celebrations amid coronavirus concerns.
 Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin announced the measures on Saturday. To encourage preventative measures, 2,000 masks will be distributed to fans who arrive without them. In a bid to keep the numbers down, 17 subway stations will be shut and three ring road entry points into Paris will be closed off.
 “Not only so things take place in the best way possible in terms of public security, but obviously so that the wearing of masks can be ensured,” Darmanin said.

I’m writing to try to clarify an unspoken fear which seems to be an undercurrent in our local elections. It was writ large in a recent letter from a writer in Seaside who said we "do not want Astoria to become Portland."
 I'm not sure how our small towns become a metropolitan area, or if she is warning us away from the diverse community of cultures, gender choices, university students or traffic and commercialism. It's left open-ended; plug in your favorite fear.
 She mentions "loyalty to the Portland agenda," and a "threat to our way of life here on the coast." What does "Portland agenda" mean, and how does it threaten us?
 Do peaceful demonstrations for human rights qualify as being sucked into whatever she sees as the "urban" agenda? Is walking at the beach or forest threatened by being thoughtful about our values? What, then, is "our way of life"?
 This then becomes connected to campaign financing by outside groups. Campaigns are supposed to report contributions, and I encourage you to do your research at the OreStar website.
 Don't be bamboozled by fear. I invite you to vote for a candidate who keeps it honest when others stoop to untruths and innuendo. Debbie Boothe-Schmidt owns a small business and has been a single mom, now married.
