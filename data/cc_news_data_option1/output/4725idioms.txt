Flory, co-author of Back-Pocket God and The Rise of Network Christianity, studies what is known as "Network Christianity," groups of charismatic Christians who follow "apostles and prophets" with few ties to institutional religion, preferring to use the internet, meetings and social media to go straight to the consumer. Trump, who used a similar approach to become president, he said, may continue to use these methods to feed a cult of personality.

A poco mas de un mes para la Navidad, no parece que el espiritu navideño impere en el Congreso de los Diputados, y menos entre afines ideologicos. Con indisimulada satisfaccion, el periodico _El Pa is_, relata lo sucedido el pasado martes en el Parlamento, cuando se debatia la propuesta del PP que pretendia sustituir el estado de alarma que estamos disfrutando mediante la reforma de dos leyes organicas: la de Medidas Especiales en materia de Salud Publica y la reguladora de la jurisdiccion contencioso-administrativa, que posibilitarian que las CCAA pudieran, bajo el control judicial, confinar a poblaciones o personas determinadas, en caso de pandemia. Este plan B, discurrido por Casado, el lider del PP, toco debatirlo en el dia de Santa Isabel de Hungria y el diputado de Vox dijo, para terminar su discurso nada amigable, que era "un conjunto de tonterias". Como todavia resonaban en el hemiciclo las acusaciones del mismo Casado a la mocion de censura propuesta por Vox, con muchas referencias personales a su lider Abascal, parecia la intervencion del diputado de Vox una respuesta a aquella intervencion. Casado solo merecio defensa de un diputado independentista, quizas por no estar muy al tanto de las complejidades de la politica, donde se enzarzan dos partidos que unas veces estan en coalicion y en otras se declaran socios preferentes, para criticar al diputado de Vox que califico la propuesta del PP como "un conjunto de tonterias", lo que en su opinion nadie debe decir en la Camara.

Those lower fees open up a way for employers to help workers save. Instead of paying $1,500 to $2,500 a year in administrative costs for a 401(k), which McNeil says is typical for her clients, small employers could use that money to help match their employees’ contributions in the SIMPLE IRA.
 Another potential option is state-sponsored retirement accounts, which typically use payroll deductions to deposit money into Roth IRAs for employees. Three states — Oregon, Illinois and California — currently offer programs that are or will eventually become mandatory for most employers that don’t have retirement plans. Several other states are setting up these plans or considering it.
 EMERGENCY SAVINGS
 A big problem with retirement accounts is that they can be costly to access in an emergency because of taxes and penalties. Skemp, 60, learned that during the Great Recession more than a decade ago, when she lost her job and had to raid her retirement account to pay her mortgage.
 Emergency savings accounts, either as a stand-alone benefit or one that’s connected to a retirement plan, can help prevent such costly withdrawals and improve workers’ financial stability. Several large companies now offer such accounts, while benefits companies including Gusto, the one Skemp’s employer used, and Businessolver offer the option to smaller businesses.
 Even if small-business owners aren’t ready to set up a formal emergency savings program, they can encourage workers to save through split direct deposit. Any employer that offers direct deposit can offer split deposit, which allows people to automatically divide paychecks between checking and savings accounts or among accounts at different banks.
 Skemp says she wishes she’d known years how important a regular, automated savings habit could be.
 “I would be so far ahead of the game right now,” she says.

His debut album, "Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial," has been streamed more than 1.5 billion times on the platform and was named top album of the year. His smash hit "The Box" logged more than 460 million Apple Music streams and was crowned top song of the year.

Why are we being faced with this choice? This year, we’ve seen our loved ones’ funerals canceled or limited while leftist elites flew across the country to attend a deceased congressman’s funeral. We’ve been scolded by CNN anchors about the importance of wearing masks while those same anchors flout their refusal to wear one themselves. We’ve been prohibited from attending religious services while riots and marches of millions shoulder to shoulder are celebrated. The mayor of Chicago has recently ordered her constituents to shelter in place, even calling on them to cancel their Thanksgiving plans, though she celebrated the election results in a crowded street last week. And there’s also the infamous photo of our resident expert Dr. Fauci, who refused to wear a mask at a baseball game while simultaneously scolding the country for months about the importance of masking.
 I use the above examples to indicate a trend. Politicians and celebrities (the societal elites) are acting as petty tyrants by imposing arbitrary requirements on the “little people” while ignoring these requirements themselves. They appear to think that they live above such things, but expect us to follow their immoral edicts to the letter. It’s a disgrace, and it should not be happening in America. Now there is talk of more lockdowns.
 Decades from now, when the history books recall this year, will it be remembered as the year that all freedoms were forfeited and never returned, or will it be remembered as the year Americans pushed back and refused to be bullied into submission. We still have a choice, for now.
