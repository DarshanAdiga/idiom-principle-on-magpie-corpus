Vibrant and resilient supply chains have kept deliveries of food and household goods on schedule since the start of the pandemic.
 In particular, America’s 140,000 miles of railroad tracks have made it possible and affordable to move goods across the country. But, if House Democrats get their way, it may soon become far more difficult for railroads to ship everything from chlorine-based disinfectants (for treating water) to corn for livestock.
 The recently released $494 billion transportation bill includes prescriptive restrictions on freight rail, such as unneeded staffing mandates promoted by leadership at rail labor organizations. The federal government should focus on expanding transportation and supply chain choices, not hampering existing viable options. America’s logistical systems will keep chugging along as long as lawmakers and regulators don’t impose unnecessary regulations.
 On June 3, House Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unveiled a nearly $500 billion bill to fund surface transportation through 2025.
 As with many other spending proposals originating from the House of Representatives these past few months, serious budgeting has taken a back seat to pet projects and wayward priorities. For example, a provision stipulating that, “No freight train may be operated unless such train has a crew of at least 1 appropriately qualified and certified conductor and 1 appropriately qualified and certified engineer,” was included in the legislation. Democratic policymakers have long pushed for mandating two-person rail crews, despite a lack of evidence that crew size mandates lead to safer rail operations.
 When the Federal Railroad Administration proposed a two-person crew rule (that they later retracted), the agency admitted that it “cannot provide reliable or conclusive statistical data to suggest whether one-person crew operations are generally safer or less safe than multiple-person crew operations.”
 Additionally, a 2017 simulation examining how humans and computer systems deal with safety concerns found that “the presence of automation with or without the conductor made much more of a difference … than the conductor alone.” State-of-the-art computer systems matter far more to safety than employee supervision, but additional regulatory requirements would kneecap railroads’ ability to invest in automation.
 The crew size mandate is just one of many ludicrous policies proposed in the transportation bill without any justification or evidence. Another example is that funding for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (aka Amtrak) tripled to $29 billion through 2025. If Amtrak was well-run before the pandemic and was suddenly on the verge of bankruptcy due to COVID-19, maybe the company would have a case for more taxpayer funding. But, the taxpayer- funded corporation’s problems precede the pandemic, when only 11 out of 45 routes posted a profit.
 In reality it’s difficult to say how profitable even the best performing lines are because Amtrak counts the subsidies it receives from 17 states as “passenger revenues.”
 Cato Institute scholar Randal O’Toole notes that Amtrak fails to adequately account for depreciation in its financial reporting. With this shoddy accounting, taxpayers have no way of figuring out where their hard-earned dollars are going. The information that Amtrak does disclose in its financials is deeply troubling and should give lawmakers pause before tripling down on funding.
 Amtrak is spending an astounding $2 billion to cut an hour off a 5.5-hour rail journey between Chicago and St. Louis. That route can just as easily be traversed via an hour flight or 4.5-hour drive, but Amtrak insists that this “investment” is the best use of taxpayer dollars.
 Whether it’s demanding that Amtrak better prioritize the taxpayer dollars it already has or backing away from train crew mandates, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee needs to go back to the drawing board with this legislation. The last thing that America’s supply chain needs right now is needless regulations and subsidies.

 The pandemic halting of life and work as we know it has decimated public transit ridership in cities across Canada and around the world. Ridership in Toronto is down 84 per cent. Montreal has lost over 80 per cent of its transit riders, Vancouver more than 75 per cent.
 Right now that adds up to financial disaster for transit systems and the cities that keep them going. The Toronto Transit Commission alone is losing $21 million a week in fares.
 But as COVID-19 restrictions lift and more people go to work, start shopping and visiting family and friends this precipitous decline in transit ridership will be much more than just a budget crisis.
 The TTC expects systemwide ridership to rebound to only 30 to 60 per cent of normal this fall.
 Not only will ridership levels that low pose an impossible financial burden for city taxpayers, Toronto will face a traffic congestion and environmental disaster if even a fraction of those former riders jump into cars instead. Before the pandemic, the TTC provided 1.8 million rides per day so we're not talking about just a few extra honking cars on the road.
 To avoid the twin disaster of near-empty streetcars and subway trains and even more gridlocked roads, public transit officials must combat the coronavirus itself -- requiring masks, frequent cleaning and protocols to encourage physical distancing and reduce crowding -- and, just as crucially, fear of the virus. Especially when much of that fear seems to be unwarranted when it comes to riding transit.
 It's understandable that many people are worried about the potential health danger of jumping on a bus, streetcar or train. For months now they've heard a steady drumbeat from health officials about avoiding crowds and enclosed spaces with others.
 But there's increasing evidence from cities that rely heavily on public transit that the fear of contracting COVID-19 on transit is greater than the reality.
 In France, for example, a public health study of the 150 infection clusters identified between early May and early June found that none of them originated on transit systems.
 And then there's the evidence of what's happening -- or, more specifically, not happening -- in transit-heavy cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong.
 They're doing better than we are when it comes to COVID-19. Tokyo had what it considers a very worrying spike of 48 new cases on Monday -- about half of Toronto's increase on the same day -- and it's been attributed to nightclubs. Not public transit.
 None of this is ironclad proof, of course, and Canadian studies would be welcome. But it does suggest that, with proper precautions in place, people have less to fear from a transit trip than they do from their activities on either end of that trip. That's important to bear in mind as we move to reopen the economy.
 We all recall the early public health advice against wearing masks, but that's now changed and they do seem to make a difference. Many large transit systems around the world already require masks.
 On Wednesday, the TTC board is expected to require most riders wear a mask or face covering starting in July. That's a good move to make the system safer -- and make people more confident about using it.
 It's clear there's no instant off switch to this crisis. The return to something resembling normal life, especially in the hardest-hit areas like Toronto and Montreal, will be gradual.
 And not everyone will return to the same work and transportation patterns they had before, especially in the short term. But, however it shakes out, transit will be as vital as it was before the pandemic.
 We can't afford to let fear of COVID-19 -- especially if it's unwarranted -- drive people from public transit and the many benefits that come with it.

 If you were thinking that Toronto feels like one of the last places in North America mostly under lockdown, you'd be right.
 The city, along with Peel and Windsor-Essex, remains stranded in Stage 1 of the province's reopening plan given that these three regions continue to produce the bulk of Ontario's new daily COVID-19 cases.
 That means no patio dining at restaurants. No open shopping malls. No professional hair cuts.
 Ontario is currently Canada's "most closed economy," with 43 per cent of small businesses open, according to survey results released Tuesday by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB).
 Many of those businesses that are still closed are likely in the Toronto and Peel areas, said Ryan Mallough, director for provincial affairs for Ontario at the CFIB.
 Much of the rest of the continent appears to be moving at a faster pace. For example, in Montreal, another Canadian hotbed of COVID-19 infections, barbershops were permitted to reopen Monday under strict conditions.
 Mallough said the CFIB is pleased the Ontario government decided to adopt a regional approach, in that it allowed other parts of the province to reopen faster given their low case numbers.
 This includes the regions surrounding Toronto and Peel, including Halton, York, and Durham, which will be able to move into Stage 2 as of Friday.
 "But at the same time if you're a business owner in Toronto, it's already frustrating if you're a hairstylist and see one in Montreal reopen and now maybe you're seeing one across the street, but you can't open," he said.
 "It's very frustrating from a business perspective. They very much want to reopen and start generating revenue again."
 Economists say that keeping Toronto in Stage 1 for a few more weeks will of course prolong the already devastating impact that the pandemic has had the economy.
 But if the city were to reopen too early and see a surge of new outbreaks, that could lead to a full shutdown again, they say, which would be even worse for the economy.
 Just look at Houston, where the Texas city of five million largely reopened last week, but where officials have already cautioned that a recent surge in new cases may force them to shut down again.
 "That's the thing we should be most worried about, not whether it takes an extra week or two to reopen," said David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.
 "I think it's important to note that if we were to open too soon and saw a second wave, the impact of shutting down a second time would, I'm sure, be far worse than waiting an extra week or two to make sure we have outbreaks under control."
 Though no exact date has been given by the government, it's reasonable to believe that Toronto could at last move into Stage 2 in a week or so should the number of new positive cases continue to decline, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician at Toronto General Hospital.
 "I think it is reasonable, but we also have to remember it's not a linear path forward. If there are outbreaks, we might need to clamp back down and that's a distinct possibility," he said.
 "I think that should be an important part of the communication ... If there are a high number of cases in a particular area or throughout the province, we might need to reimpose public health restrictions."
 The question also remains as to how many Toronto businesses will even be able to survive once they're given the green light to reopen.
 "Smaller businesses particularly, the longer they're closed, the more difficult it is for them to open, because they're paying their fixed costs like rent and they're running out of money," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist, Dominion Lending Centres.
 Even once restaurants, for example, can finally start serving people again on patios in Toronto, recovery will still be a long way off, said Mallough at the CFIB.
 For one thing, they'll be operating at reduced capacity to meet physical distancing requirements.
 "We may see a bit of a boom at the beginning, but we're talking about three months for most businesses of near zero revenue," he said, referring to the time these businesses have been largely closed.
 "A good summer it not going to make up for that. A great summer is not going to make up for that."

Tears flowed freely in the beauty community on Tuesday, as RawBeautyKristi uploaded one of her rawest videos yet -- an emotional pregnancy announcement. The 9-minute video included a montage of the YouTuber talking about her 15-year struggle with infertility, including one clip filmed earlier this year with her husband Zack that included her saying that she had finally come to terms with the fact that she would not be having children.
 But just six days after the couple filmed that clip, RawBeautyKristi tested positive for the first time, and she filmed her shocked reaction. In the video, she wrote that she has filmed every test reaction for the past 12 years, just in case.
 "I had completely 1000000% resigned myself to the fact that this day would NEVER come and I was fine with that," she wrote in the video's description. "The reaction you see me have is of utter and complete disbelief. I swear.. even as I sit here and write this, I feel like I am in some dream. I don't even know WHEN this will feel real or when this will sink in."
 The same day she uploaded the announcment video, RawBeautyKristi also hit 1 million YouTube subscribers. Other beauty YouTubers quickly congratulated her on both milestones on Twitter, and fans joined in too.

Now that the television network Bravo has confirmed that Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute won't be returning to "Vanderpump Rules," Faith Stowers feels like she's found closure. Also, all things considered, Schroeder, Doute, and their remaining fans should perhaps be grateful Stowers left it at that.
 "There were a few people who didn't agree with Bravo's decision to do this, and they're blaming it on me, because those characters for them were their favorite," Stowers told Insider over the phone. "But at the end of the day I feel like I'm doing them a favor, because I could have filed suit. And I would have won."
 Stowers, who appeared on "Vanderpump Rules" as a recurring cast member in season 4 and the show's only Black star, never expected that retelling what Schroeder and Doute did to her in 2018 would end with the two getting cut from the series, along with Max Boyens and Brett Caprioni, or that Schroeder's sponsors would publicly cut ties with her.
 But after sharing the story on Instagram Live of how Schroeder and Doute lobbed false, defamatory accusations her way that year, going so far as to call police on Stowers repeatedly for crimes she didn't commit, an online firestorm of angry "Vanderpump Rules" fans called for change.
