Previously, Gary Dauberman had signed on as the writer for _Salem’s Lot_ , and it was foreseen that he could be one of the candidates for the director’s chair when the rubber was bound to hit the road. Though it should be noted at this point that while the 1975 novel is heading into a new phase of its lifecycle, there’s probably a lot of caution being taken in the next steps. It should also be noted that this project shouldn’t be confused with the Epix’s series _Jerusalem’s Lot_, which is a prequel set before the events of _Salem’s_ Lot. It’s also currently in development, and set to star Adrian Brody.

“The Department of Motor Vehicles still requires a wet signature,” Kelman said.
 To deliver a car, Community Chevy disinfects it first then drives it to the buyer’s home or place of business. The driver wears a mask and gloves; the transaction might be completed on the hood of the new car or truck.
 The driver will bring a mask and gloves for the customer to use “when available,” Kelman said. “But they’re not always available.”
 The smoothness of online car buying will vary, depending on the dealer.
 “For the majority of dealers, online sales were only a small percentage of total sales” before coronavirus hit, said Joern Buss, an auto industry consultant with the firm Oliver Wyman. Most “are not set up to handle” a surge in online demand.
 The range in online expertise can be seen on the websites of two California dealers, Toyota of Oxnard and Toyota of Orange, which are owned by two different dealer groups.
 It was difficult to figure out whether a car could be bought online at Toyota of Oxnard. The Times tried the chat function twice to see if internet sales were supported, and both times that chat service rep — who appeared to be a human — said they didn’t know. General Manager John Hautman has not yet responded to a request for comment.
 Meantime, Toyota of Orange includes a dropdown option on its homepage marked “Express Store” that seamlessly takes a buyer through the entire purchase process — although at the end, the customer is told a sales rep would help complete the paperwork (with the possibility, of course, of some upselling).
 “We’ve been experimenting with this for some time,” said Allen Moznett, general manager at Toyota of Orange. But the pandemic has shoved his dealership up the learning curve. “We’re trying to master online sales now.”
 Buyers might also try a number of online car sales specialists, such as True Car, Cars Direct, Fair and Carvana. The sites are easier to navigate than most dealer sites, and price comparison is easier, but because you’re not usually dealing directly with a sales representative, it’s much harder to hammer out a rock-bottom price.
 Moznett said that post-crisis “the information gathering process will probably all be done online” before and after a visit to the showroom. But he thinks that in time most buyers will gravitate back to showrooms.
 “They want to come in, look at the cars, smell the new-car smell,” he said. “The color of a car on a computer and the colors on the car are different.”
 How long the pandemic lasts and how long showrooms remain shut is unknown. A March 30 survey by the California dealers group showed 130 of 322 dealers who responded said they could sustain operations at current sales levels for only one to three months. The group represents 1,409 dealerships total.
 Sandler said dealership failures are inevitable, but “every time we’ve gone through a crisis, you lose undercapitalized dealers. Eventually sales will climb back to normal, but with fewer, larger dealers.”
