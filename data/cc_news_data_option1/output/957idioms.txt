One way to counteract misleading tobacco videos, the APPC team said, is to place corrective ads that counter the misinformation on the same page as the pro-tobacco videos. In an earlier study, APPC researchers found it was possible to counteract pro-tobacco videos on YouTube by showing a corrective message on the severity and scope of health risks associated with smoking.

In other words, China's current ban on wild meat could move the trade to its neighbors, which is why WWF Asia Pacific is urging other nations to follow suit with their own bans. It recommended that governments increase market inspections and raise awareness among the public to stop the sale and consumption of wildlife products.

OTTAWA - A top Trump administration adviser on telecommunications met today with officials in Ottawa as Canada has yet to decide whether to allow Chinese firm Huawei to participate in its new 5G wireless internet network.
 Robert Blair, the White House special representative for international telecommunications, met with unspecified people in the Canadian government.
 The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and a spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland confirmed today's meeting but did not provide details, including who from Canada took part in the talks.
 President Donald Trump has warned American allies, especially those in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network that includes Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand, not to allow Huawei into their next-generation 5G networks.
 The U.S. deems the Chinese tech giant a national-security threat — a charge the company denies.
 A former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques, says more oversight of Huawei's operations in Canada could apply if the company agreed to become a publicly traded entity in this country.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 9, 2020.

TORONTO - North American stock markets suffered their worst meltdown since the global financial crisis as a collapse in oil prices triggered a plunge in the energy sector and prompted the loonie to take a dive.
 The S&P/TSX composite index sank as much as 10 per cent in early Monday trading to hit a 14-month low. It lost 7.9 per cent or 1,283.94 points at 14,891.08 by early afternoon. The capped energy index decreased more than 23 per cent with Cenovus Energy Inc. down 48 per cent and Crescent Point Energy Corp. off 34 per cent.
 The decreases came as crude oil prices initially fell to a four-year low in the steepest one-day decrease since the 1991 Gulf War. The action was ignited after Russia refused over the weekend to roll back production and Saudi Arabia responded by launching a crude war by vowing to ramp up output.
 The April crude contract was down US$7.94 at US$33.34 per barrel and the April natural gas contract was up 1.6 cents at US$1.72 per mmBTU.
 Early panic selling triggered volume alerts that briefly shut markets in the U.S. and Canada.
 It prompted a broad-based selloff before more defensive sectors clawed back some of the losses and reverted to normalized activity, says Mike Archibald, vice-president and portfolio manager with AGF Investments Inc.
 In addition, concerns persist about the economic impact of the spread of the novel coronavirus and geopolitical tensions after North Korea fired some missiles.
 "It's kind of the perfect storm of bad events on the weekend and obviously that's culminating in a rush to the exits here this morning on a number of assets," he said in an interview.
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 1,676.36 points or 6.5 per cent at 24,188.42. The S&P 500 index was down 181.48 points at 2,790.89, while the Nasdaq composite was down 456.52 points at 8,119.10.
 The Canadian dollar traded sank to its lowest level since January 2019 by trading at an average of 73.66 cents US compared with an average of 74.51 cents US on Friday.
 The April gold contract was down US$1.80 at US$1,670.60 an ounce and the May copper contract was down 4.75 cents at US$2.51 a pound.

It can happen to the even the most cyber-conscientious business. Internal networking, employee education and other measures have been taken to thwart a cyberattack, but the day still comes when your company falls victim to that dreaded hack.
 While the goal is to avoid criminal cyber infiltration and have preventive steps in place, it's equally important for businesses to develop a reactive plan to respond to an attack.
 First up is containment. Once a cyber event has been identified it's time to swiftly move on to containing it, starting with taking all "infected" devices off the company's network and clearing corrupted files off servers followed by changing all passwords. Large-scale data breaches may even require a business to shut down its network completely and bring servers back online sequentially.
 After containment, the next priority is investigation. Determine how hackers were able to penetrate your system, which information assets were exposed and what data still may be at risk. Business owners will need to work with their IT team or cybersecurity consultant to answer these questions ASAP.
 Some industries are governed by specific state/federal laws and compliance regulations that must be followed in the aftermath of a data breach. These companies have an obligation to work with their cybersecurity consultants and legal team to ensure compliance is met in a timely, accurate manner from both a state and federal perspective. In addition, businesses should report the cyberattack to their local authorities.
 Businesses who have been breached are obligated to be transparent with their customers - this isn't just good industry practice, it's the law. Written notifications must be sent to every customer with a clear explanation of the problem, when it happened and what is being done to solve it. But don't take on this initiative on by yourself…get direction and input from an attorney.
 Often a data breach is a result of an unintentional employee error; someone might have fallen for a phishing scam, clicked on an insecure link or entered a secure password while using an insecure internet connection. Mistakes happen. Singling out an employee who may have made a bad judgment is not as important as clearly communicating to your entire staff how the hacker "got in" so that the mistake is not revisited in the future.
 Once hacked, it's tough to overcome a sense of vulnerability. No business wants to be compromised once, let alone multiple times, but the reality is it could happen again. That's why it's crucial to an annual security and vulnerability assessment performed along with a regularly updated response plan in place at all times.

Many people choose to phone it in during their last day at a job. But fashion- wise, Meghan Markle was not about to go gently into her final official duty as a royal. The Duchess of Sussex arrived at the annual Commonwealth Day celebration in a gemstone green fitted frock by Emilia Wickstead and matching fishnet fascinator. Business as usual.
 The Duchess’ dress had a demi-cape slung over her left shoulder, which made the entire look seem just a bit art deco. It would not have looked out-of- place on Wallis Simpson in 1936. She carried a Gabriela Hearst purse.
 After a weekend spent coordinating outfits with Prince Harry—more specifically, matching her dress to his ties—the two twinned once again before returning to their new lives in Canada. Though they chose to not walk the procession alongside the Queen, though the family all sat together in Westminster Abbey.
 As they entered the church they were married in, the fabric draping over Meghan’s shoulder breezed in the wind quite photogenically, and she smiled for the cameras. For a couple who decided to eschew tradition so boldly, sending British tabloids into a tizzy with their January announcement of ditching their lives as royals, it was a very diplomatic display—even if Meghan’s outfit looked fussy, like an American’s idea of how British people dress.
 Though Meghan gamely took a victory lap through the UK this week, one cannot help but close-read her overdone look as a statement on her allegedly- miserable life as a Duchess. The dress seems a little self-conscious, and way too much. Plus, a neckline like that is always itchy on the collarbone.
 Meghan and Harry sat behind Kate and William in the chapel, and the group formerly known as the Fab Four did not speak to each other while waiting for things to begin. Anyone who has ever cursed their assigned dinner table at a wedding might understand the feeling.
 If Meghan went for slight costumey drama, Kate played it safe in a go-to style from one of her favorite designers. As _Harper’s Bazaar_ noted, she opted for a rusty crimson red coat dress by Catherine Walker. It’s an outfit she knows well, having worn it on Christmas in 2018. It was a far cry from the sartorial risks she took during her visit to Ireland last week (vintage Oscar de la Renta! Polka dots! A haircut!), but it got the job done.
 Like all fun aunts, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex (who is married to the Queen’s son, Prince Edward), has a front row seat to family drama she’s mostly removed from. She and her husband sat next to Meghan and Harry, Sophie wearing a white sheath with a black swoosh print on the skirt. A solid effort, and probably a preview of what’s to come if Sophie takes up more of Meghan’s duties.
 Of course, no royal engagement party gets started until the Queen arrives, and she did so in a periwinkle coat dress and matching wide-brim hat. She sat with her family, and all three of the women stood out from the sea of black and navy suits in their colorful ensembles.
 So the last day that Meghan and Harry have to sit up straight in uncomfortable wooden seats has come and gone. The young family will head back to Canada and their son Archie to an unknown future that could involve more corporate speeches and dinners with J.Lo.
 If you want a preview of what Meghan’s closet might look like post-palace, check out the ultra-glam, slightly Bond girl red cape Safiyaa gown she wore to a black tie event on Saturday.
 Meghan, a vocal environmentalist, loves to rewear her designer dresses, but don’t hold your breath for a repeat performance of the high-necked, church- approved jade number she picked for Monday.
 Here’s to hoping she gets home, back to her beloved yoga pants and knitted beanies, as quickly as possible.

The play, written by Sally Abbott and co-directed by Kathy Burke and Scott Graham, centres on three separate storylines underpinned by the same human need for love.
 Mother and son Josie and Manny, sisters Clare and Ange and married couple Graham and Bex each face tribulation, as their relationships are tested by life's most difficult situations.
 The Stratford East is one of several stops on a whistle-stop tour, but for one star, it holds extra significance.
 Actress Chizzy Akudolu, who plays Josie in the production, made her professional debut at the theatre.
 Chizzy, who lived in Newham for several years, credits the theatre as where she "fell in love" with performing. She also opened its new green room last year.
 She returns with distinction in this production, despite being plagued by a cold.
 Though under the weather, Chizzy is in good spirits as she discusses her homecoming: "I expect the loudest reaction in Stratford. We're a small cast and we all rely on each other. It's a good pressure."
 This reliance is in evidence throughout; the production uses wheeled panels as a prop, choreographed by the cast to create different backdrops.
 This offers the compelling visual of a cast working together despite differing storylines, as a bridge becomes a bed, which then becomes a living room wall.
 It's a clever tool which emphasises the idea that these characters will all become connected in some way.
 Josie is first seen welcoming her son Manny back from Cambridge.
 Recently bereaved by losing both her father and dog Queenie, Josie compensates by throwing everything into Manny's return, proudly reeling off his achievements.
 It's clear that Manny feels differently about his status as a Cambridge student, with this the catalyst for discord between the two.
 Manny considers himself an outsider burdened by imposter syndrome. Josie celebrates that status, bullish in the view that Manny deserves to sit with the elite.

È stata la parte più difficile che abbia mai avuto nella mia vita. Non potevo fumare o bere in pubblico. Semplicemente non potevo. La parte più difficile nell'interpretare Cristo è stata che dovevo mantenere l'immagine 24 ore su 24. Appena finito il film, sono tornato a casa in Svezia e ho cercato di ritrovare il mio vecchio io.
