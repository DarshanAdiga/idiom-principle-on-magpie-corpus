“Well indeed but that’s due to the fact I came to loathe it,” he indicates forcibly. “As I claimed right before, again in the Script… and Fugazi days, I imagine that they trustworthy me and there have been a good deal of suggestions around that we could sift by way of. Clutching At Straws was when we moved into songwriting. It was exciting due to the fact when we moved into crafting the album that was meant to appear immediately after Clutching At Straws, suddenly I was getting introduced with hundreds of bits. But they didn’t make feeling. It was like acquiring diverse scenes from distinctive films and trying to assemble a tale amongst it, you know?

Arts sector suffering across the board
 In Northbridge, Perth's cultural precinct sits empty and desolate — a stark contrast to just a few months ago, when Fringe World and Perth Festival had the area and its surrounds bursting with energy.
 Nestled within the precinct is the Blue Room Theatre, an independent theatre company focussed on nurturing creatives and where the likes of Tim Minchin and Kate Mulvany began their careers.
 The theatre was among other notable arts institutions across the country recently devastated when it lost federal funding through the Australia Council — a blow delivered earlier this month to the already struggling sector.
