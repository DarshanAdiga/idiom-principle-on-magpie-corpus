A “significant” amount of money from the federal government will be needed to save many small businesses, he said.
 State residents in the meantime have collected about $550 million in unemployment claims, which includes the $600 a week from the federal government.
 “It is amazing,” Justice said of the figure.
 Scott Adkins, acting commissioner of WorkForce West Virginia, said the agency continues to work on claims that had some issues before they can finishing processing them.
 “We are working diligently around the clock to address those issues,” he said. “We are doing everything possible.”
 With more businesses opening up next week on May 21, including the Hatfield- McCoy ATV Trail System and the whitewater rafting industry, Justice said he is aware many out-of-state visitors will be coming to the state.
 “Those businesses themselves are informing the customers coming (of the guidelines they must follow while here,),” he said in response to a question about safety.
 All of those situations will be carefully watched and monitored, he said, to make sure rules are being followed.
 If a spike in new cases results from that or related to any business reopening, the state will immediately handle that situation with a rapid response to stop the spread of the virus, but also may reconsider whether the reopening should continue.
 “Be prepared if we get (critical) blips on the screen,” he said. “We will slow down, stop or pull back. It may not be very tasteful from the standpoint of pulling back, but are going to (if necessary).”
 Justice also declared Sunday as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma Awareness Day in the state, referring to a rare and deadly childhood disease, referencing a victim in Princeton who died last year from the disease.
 “She was Lindsey Varney at Princeton High School,” who was 17 when she died and Justice said she was a “beautiful kid” in a community he has visited many times.
 “Please remember her,” he said. “We are not going to forget Lindsey and her family.”

This is the condition that ultimately kills patients suffering from the gravest form of COVID-19.
 But that promising research is now in the deep freeze. Literally. Vital tissue cultures from our experiments are in the freezer for an undetermined period of time until we can return to the lab.
 Virtually all our ongoing experiments had to be terminated, and our laboratory infrastructure went into hibernation mode. Restarting research is not like flipping on a light switch.
 We will need to rebreed enough animals for experiments, retest all samples whose quality may have deteriorated, turn equipment back on and recalibrate delicate machinery.
 It could take six to 12 months before we are back up to full speed.
 Now take our experience and multiply it by many thousands of labs around the world starting from scratch.
 Every scientist’s project slammed to a halt at the same time. Since collaboration is the major pillar of science, we must wait until everybody’s lab is up and running to reinstate the research pipeline.
 The few labs that remained open, largely to help with the diagnostics of COVID-19, are still swamped by COVID-19-related needs and unable to support other research labs in their effort to restart.
 These research delays are also affecting the careers of postdocs and doctoral students — the scientists of the future — worldwide.

Three persons from Kozhikode in Kerala were killed and two others sustained injuries after a sports utility vehicle (SUV) they were travelling by collided with a stationary tipper truck on Hyderabad-Nagpur national highway (NH-44) in Telangana's Nizamabad district in the early hours of Saturday, the police said.The deceased were identified as Anesh (32), Stalin (21), and Analia (15). The injured - Divya (27) and Alekhya (5) - are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Nizamabad.Though it was initially suspected that the victims were migrant labourers, later the police found out that they were working for a school in Bihar's Nawada town."They belong to Kozhikode in Kerala. The victims, along with 10 other people, were returning to their native place in three vehicles because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak," G Venkateshwarlu, the inspector of police, Dichpalli, told HT."The victims were travelling in an SUV at a high speed, when the driver lost control and rammed into a tipper truck at Mentrajpalli village under Dichpalli block at around 4 am on Saturday," the inspector said."The tipper truck had met with an accident the previous day a few kilometres away and was being towed away by another vehicle. It came to a halt at Metrajpalli suddenly due to decoupling between the two vehicles. Even before the driver of the towing vehicle could get off, the SUV came at a high speed and rammed into the tipper from behind," he added.While Anesh, his daughter Analia, and Stalin, another school teacher, who was driving the vehicle, died on the spot, Anesh's wife Divya and another daughter Alekhya, who were sleeping on the back seat, were injured in the accident."We've registered a case and a probe is being conducted," Venkateshwarlu said.In another separate accident on the same NH-44 a couple of hours later, 20 people were injured after a truck, carrying around 50 migrant labourers from Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, fell off the road into a gorge at Kondapur village of Nirmal district, the police said.The condition of nine of the migrant labourers, who were returning to their native place from Hyderabad, is said to be serious.The police said the accident occurred at around 6 am when the speeding lorry hit the railing on the left side of the national highway and fell into the adjacent gorge. The injured were admitted to the government hospital in Nirmal.State endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy, who belongs to Nirmal, visited the accident spot and supervised the rescue operations.

May 15, 1995


  Under threat of losing the North American Snowmobile Festival, the Wexford board reached a compromise that will continue to allow the serving of alcohol at the Wexford Civic Arena. The compromise will make organizations wishing to serve alcohol apply for their own liquor licenses, sign a newly created accident waiver and release of liability with the county, and buy at least $1 million of liability insurance. The compromise also prohibits county departments from selling or distributing alcoholic beverages, on county property or not. Board member Terry Harvey had been steadfast in his opposition to county involvement in the serving of alcohol on county property. But Harvey joined the majority in approving the serving of alcohol under the new set of conditions. "I see this as a step in the right direction," Harvey said. "It raises the liability (from $500,000) at least, and the county is not promoting it." Board member Bob Lee said NASF officials had stated the annual snowmobile festival would be cancelled if alcohol was not allowed at the Civic Arena. Lee said the festival would be cancelled because alcohol sales make up much of the festival's revenue. Bob Reddy was the sole board member to vote against the compromise. John Wheat was absent from the vote. Reddy said the $1 million of insurance was not enough. "The $1 million is basically peanuts," Reddy said. "McDonald's paid $3 million for some lady who spilled hot coffee. That is nothing compared to what might happen by serving alcohol. If you want to open the county to lawsuits, be my guest." Lee said the $1 million liability insurance is typical in the area for organizations wishing to serve alcohol at public events. "In terms of liability — we have a lot of county property," Lee countered. "We are open to liability all the time if someone slips or falls on any of our property." The alcohol at the arena issue flared last year when the suggestion was made that the county apply for the liquor license for the first annual Wexford Enduro 300 snowmobile race. The thought was the county could increase its revenue from the event by selling alcohol itself.

 POLK CITY -- A Polk County sheriff's deputy was arrested after driving drunk to a party attended by other deputies, the Sheriff's Office said Friday.
 Deputy Alfredo Marenco, 29, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence shortly after midnight Friday.
 According a Sheriff's Office news release, Polk deputies were at a party at another deputy's home in Polk City when they saw Marenco drive up in a white pickup. An investigating deputy said he could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Marenco, and that Marenco was slurring, swaying and had bloodshot eyes.
 Marenco failed a standard field sobriety test and refused a breath test, the sheriff's release said. He was arrested and booked into the Polk County Jail.
 Marenco resigned from the Sheriff's Office. If he hadn't, he would have been terminated, the release said. He was hired in January 2015 and was assigned as a patrol deputy. His driver's license will be suspended by the state for one year because he did not consent to a breath test.

 His invention uses wireless microphones mounted inside blades, wireless speakers inside the turbine’s cavity and a microphone placed near the structure to monitor the sounds emanating from inside of it. Any changes in audio frequencies would signal blade damage, according to Inalpolat.
 In addition to the grant from the DOE, Inalpolat has received support for his research from the National Science Foundation and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, along with UMass Lowell’s WindSTAR research center and other areas of the university.

Trump, refusing to wear a mask, asked to meet World War II veterans. “You didn’t worry about me, you only worried about them,” Trump complained when asked about the potential danger to the old soldiers.
 With thousands more dying, Trump repeatedly insisted the virus would “just disappear,” without a vaccine. “We’ll never see it again.” Scientifically impossible.
 Vice President Mike Pence declared in late April, “I think honestly, if you look at the trends today, by Memorial Day weekend we will have this coronavirus epidemic behind us.” Not happening.
 Then, as now, it was often too late to help. Walking and talking victims, seemingly on the mend, fell dead minutes later.
 Then, as now, the virus destroyed the lung, heart or kidneys and killed not just the elderly and vulnerable but also healthy young adults. The medical establishment was overwhelmed, frustrated and at risk. Children, then as now, seemed fine and later developed serious health complications.
 Then, private nurses were kidnapped and held hostage. Now, medical personnel are held hostage to a lack of medical supplies and an unyielding sense of duty.
 Doctors’ warnings went unheeded in 1918. Today, “It’s a horrible thing to think we could have done something, and we didn’t,” mourned Dr. Rick Bright after weeks of political inaction. He headed the agency trying to find a COVID-19 vaccine. Then he was fired for disputing Trump’s false insistence that a drug unproven to fight the virus be funded with millions of taxpayer dollars.
 Barry, remarkable historian of the 1918 pandemic, concluded after seven years of research into its horror and terror: “If there is a single dominant lesson from 1918, it’s that governments need to tell the truth in a crisis. You don’t manage the truth. You tell the truth.”

One was Dr. Porter, a medical man and local landowner whose name graced a nearby section of land about half a mile below our house down Route 644. A nice, flat section perfectly suited for homes to provide dwellings for miners who worked at Jenkinjones or Gary Hollow or Bishop was the place he owned and sold off in the late 1940s – early 50s. It is still referred to by older residents as “The Porter Farm.” Doctor Porter’s office was down at the end of Center Street across from the Bank of Pocahontas and just west of the old Norfolk & Western depot in town.
 Doc Porter, like former West Virginia Secretary of State Ken Heckler, was known for traveling around in his Jeep. What is not always as well known is the tremendous home he owned over in the historic town of Bramwell. I was in it once and can tell you that at that time, the fireplace was large enough to allow me to stand up in it without bending over. Just thought you might want to know that.
 The “other” doctor was Dr. Ballard – Howard Hampton Ballard, as I recall. His office was adjacent to the upper Company Store and on the street where the courthouse/jail was located. In those days, each town in the county had its own jail and local court where small crimes and misdemeanors were dealt with. In the case of serious issues, the culprits would be transferred across the mountains to Tazewell where the big county jail was. Once again, this is for the younger readers who might not have known about that.
 Now, usually we had gone to Doctor Porter, which was simply something the older people in the family had done. I never looked forward to that because Doc, who seemed a very stern and serious man, was not at all hesitant to use a needle. I have no idea how long penicillin had been on the market but he might have had stock in it because it seemed to me that seldom did anyone go in for a medical issue before the old syringe would appear, the sleeve would be pulled up, a piece of cotton wet with a dash of alcohol would swipe across the upper arm and the silver spur would sting as it pierced the skin before injecting the wonder drug. It still hurts after all these years.
 Even doctors, it seems, must rest or go out of town sometimes and so it happened one spring day that I had a cold or some similar malady which Mom and Dad decided should be attended to by someone with a medical degree. Despite my best efforts to talk them out of it, down the road we went.

 In northeastern Indiana, Steuben County ranked sixth with 345 birds harvested, down slightly from its prior four-year average of 347 turkeys taken. In the last four years, the highest number was 262 turkeys bagged in Steuben County in 2016. In 2019, Steuben hunters claimed 330 birds.
 Noble County came in a eighth with 336, up more than 22% from its four-year average of 275, and a good jump from 2017 when its previous four-year high of 317 birds.
 DeKalb County ranked 13th with 295 turkeys taken, or 9.2% above its most recent average.
 LaGrange County saw a 10.1% drop off from its prior four-year average with 226 birds. Whitley County hunters bagged 114 turkeys, well above its four-year average of 97.
 Backs said COVID-19 may have played a big factor in the state’s record-setting year.
 Backs said there were a lot of Hoosiers who had increased hunting time available because they were not working due to the pandemic. More youngsters were hunting because schools were not in session.
 “We saw a big upsurge in license sales this spring,” Backs said. “They saw the same thing in other states.”
 Another factor which played into the high yield in 2020 was the weather, Backs said.
 The cool temperatures kept the bugs to a minimum, so the pesky critters were not driving hunters out of the woods.
 “We had good weather,” Backs said.
 Backs said LaGrange County’s 10.1% dip shouldn’t be too concerning.

De Blasio’s relationship with Barbot has been strained in part because Health Department officials have tattled to reporters that de Blasio resisted their expert advice in the crisis’ early days, and in part because Barbot has seemed less than on the ball at a time when falling off the ball means people dying. Her rodent-rear spat with the cops hasn’t helped either.
 Whatever the cause, there’s zero excuse for a chief executive and his top health person to fail to communicate constantly as a crisis rages.

To the editor:
 As a voter living in far southeast DeKalb County, and as a member of Right to Life of Northeast Indiana, I support Mike Watson for the DeKalb County Commission, Southeast District, because of the responsiveness he has demonstrated and his commitment to pro-life values.
 I’m sure from their resumes that both candidates on the ballot for the Southeast District County Commissioner are well qualified. My wife and I are relatively new residents of DeKalb County; we built and moved into our retirement home here about six years ago. I have not known Mike or his opponent very long, having only met them via monthly coffees over the last few months. Searching online in KPC for recent letters of support for Mike and his opponent, I notice that among the three letters of support for Mike’s opponent, two are from the current county commissioners. There have been nine letters of support for Mike from residents who are not county commissioners.
 Studying the campaign letters received from both Mike and his opponent a few weeks ago, I noticed that only Mike’s letter encouraged the recipients to contact him with comments and questions.

A popular Iowa college town offers visitors a peaceful, quiet visit with interesting things to do and great pizza.      Grinnell is home to Grinnell College, which adds to the comfortable and inviting feel of this city of just over 9,000 residents. It is a place where visitors can walk the streets, shop, eat and enjoy the friendly, laid-back atmosphere.      Grinnell is known as the Jewel of the Prairie, as it is loaded with some of Iowa's best independent restaurants and unique shops. It has been named as one of the Top Ten Coolest Small Towns in America by travel journalists.      History   A visit must include spending some time admiring the Merchants' National Bank building, one of the eight Midwestern "jewel box" banks designed by Louis Sullivan, an architecture legend and mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.      The jewel box banks are made of brick. For the Grinnell bank, Sullivan chose a variety of brick colors, giving the 1914 building a reddish-brown appearance. The building has a jewel box or strongbox look with an ornamental interior and cathedral-like exterior.      The building is open to the public. It is currently the Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce and visitors center. It is open year-round Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead for a weekend visit. Docents are often available to answer questions. For more information call 641-236-6555.      Art   Grinnell thrives in arts and culture. The Grinnell College Museum of Art, formerly known as the Faulconer Gallery, is in the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts and is worth a stop. The museum offers major exhibits from international and national artists. The museum encompasses a print and drawing study room that offers students and faculty a place to see original works on paper from the museum's collection, including some by Pablo Picasso and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum has more than 6,000 items.      It is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday except for major holidays, but is currently closed due to the pandemic. Check the website for opening information or contact wrightl@grinnell.edu. The museum is also offering virtual tours and information from the artists at grinnell.edu/campus-life/arts-culture/museum.      Unique stay   There were probably times, as a student, you might have fallen asleep in class, but this unique, fun hotel offers visitors a chance to sleep in a classroom and not get in trouble.      Hotel Grinnell is a 1921 former junior high building with a variety of modern hotel rooms. Although the rooms are modern, they are also retro, and the design incorporates school items such as benches and the original hardwood floors. Rooms, in general, are half classroom and proved to be quiet and peaceful.      The hotel uses a bit of humor. An example is the necktie visitors hang on the door to not be disturbed. Rooms are not all the same as the former locker rooms are now bunk rooms. Each room also has a chalkboard. One of guests' favorite amenities are the complimentary bikes to get around town.      Different artwork is displayed in each room. The halls have been kept looking like a school, yet with a comfortable setting of a modern hotel.      The Periodic Table bar takes on a gymnasium look with an operating scoreboard on the wall. Owner-Operator Angela Harrington said the bar specializes in craft cocktails and mocktails. They have suspended food service at this time to encourage guests to dine around town.      The hotel is currently open with touchless check-in and has suspended daily cleaning services to minimize the exposure to others of each room. However, there are always housekeeping services available when needed. Visit hotelgrinnell.com for more information.      Pizza   There are a variety of great restaurants in Grinnell, and one that pizza seekers stand in line for is Pagliai's, known for their fresh made dough. They have been serving up pies since 1957. They also offer made from scratch dishes passed down from generation to generation. It won't disappoint and is within walking distance of Hotel Grinnell. Visit pagliaisgrinnellia.com for hours and new on when dine-in reopens.      Grinnell is a gem of a town located between Des Moines and Iowa City. It is well worth the short venture off I-80 to enjoy a day, a weekend, or to kick back for a few days and enjoy a peaceful walkable community adventure.      If you travel soon, make sure to check online or with the places you plan to visit to see if they are open, or have new hours, etc.

ST. PETERSBURG -- Elizabeth Hubbart was booked for a cruise that followed the path of Lewis and Clark's expedition in the Pacific Northwest. Joel Demski was set to watch and cheer his grandson graduating from the Naval Academy. James Kelly planned a trip to Scotland, to scatter his father's ashes in the Clyde River near Glasgow.
   
 They are all older than 60. And like millions of others, they now face the painful realization that their plans, their hopes, their bucket-list items, were not simply deferred but in many cases denied thanks to the coronavirus.
   
 The global pandemic has left them wondering about the time they have left, and how to spend those moments when movement is severely limited. Instead of taking in the Seven Wonders of the World or making family memories, many are worried about the mundane, like whether it's safe to grocery shop or even go outdoors.
   
 Guilt, anger and frustration seep in, with all this precious time lost.
   
 "One less year is one less trip," said 72-year-old Bob Busch, an avid traveler from Sarasota, who canceled a 35-day camping trip with his wife. They are healthy this year, but what about in the future, after the pandemic has passed? "How many times can you hook up the trailer and head west?"
   
 Demski, who lives in Vero Beach, was crestfallen when the Naval Academy canceled its graduation ceremonies. Instead of taking in the celebration in Annapolis with his grandson, he is left with concern as the young man ships out on his assignment. Plans to see another grandson graduate from UCLA in California have also been scrapped.
   
 "I'm really just sad. It's sadness for the whole country," said Demski, who is a few months shy of his 80th birthday.
   
 Mick Smyer, a psychology professor at Bucknell University who studies aging and the elderly, said the Baby Boom generation is among the first to have additional years of vitality. This pandemic is hitting in the middle of their generation's "developmental task," which, as the American Psychological Association defines it, is "the fundamental physical, social, intellectual, and emotional achievements and abilities that must be acquired at each stage of life for normal and healthy development."
   
 In other words, boomers are feeling their mortality. As headlines blare about elders being more susceptible to dying of Coronavirus, the healthy wonder: Will I be able to achieve, see, and do everything I wanted out of life?
   
 "Boomers are thinking back about whether it has it been a good life, and what was it all about," he said. "Now there are fewer options in the near term. The next two years are off the table, and how many good years are left?"
   
 Kelly, a 63-year-old psychologist, also plays guitar and writes country rock and Americana songs. Lately, he's been pondering his fate as he sits alone in his Atlanta home, thinking about when he'll be able to bring his father's ashes to his native Scotland.
   
 "My most recent songs have been about aging." he said. "Dealing with life and loss. The road behind and the road ahead, about how much is behind me and how little is in front of me."
   
 "There's not a lot more road in front of me," he recently wrote in a song lyric.
   
 At the same time, many acknowledge that their sacrifices are also a product of privilege. Millions of people who are unemployed or working in essential, yet low-wage jobs, don't have that luxury now -- or possibly ever.
   
 "Some of my emotion, in all honesty, is guilt," said Judy Forman, a 70-year- old from Flourtown, Pennsylvania. "We're inconvenienced and we're scared and we're able to handle it. I try to help as much as I can. When I get a food order, I leave a huge tip. I give to food pantries."
   
 But the feeling that time is slipping away grates on her. She can't travel to visit one of her daughters in California. She can't even hug her three grandsons, who live across the street.
   
 "It's depression, loneliness. It's boredom. Fear. Mostly fear." She spends hours wiping down groceries, sanitizing doorknobs, thinking about how the future will be permanently different from now on.
   
 "I do all this because I don't want to die. So yeah, I'm feeling my mortality," she said in a quiet voice.
   
 Helen Miltiades, a professor of gerontology at Fresno State in California, said older adults are struggling in ways younger folks aren't.
   
 "The whole phrase 'the new normal.' People are using that, but what does that mean? People make jokes about it. That's a way of coping with change without really understanding what the change entails. I don't think we have that figured out yet."
   
 Hubbart, who was supposed to go on the cruise with her husband, canceled that. The 70-year-old Miami resident is holding onto a shred of hope that she can see Hugh Jackman -- her favorite actor -- on Broadway this fall, but she's prepared for disappointment.
   
 "This was supposed to be my decade," she said. "And it's going to be very different than I expected."
   
 Dena Davis is more optimistic. She's a 73-year-old professor of bioethics at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. She has postponed her sabbatical because of the pandemic and figures her plans for retirement have been pushed back.
   
 "If you're lucky, the reason there isn't that much more time is because you've already had a lot of time. ... It depends on the way you look at it," she said. "I'm not seeing endless vistas in front of me. There are pretty big vistas behind me. You can't have it both ways."

With that in mind, I would expect to see more multi-tight end packages from the Buccaneers, with a heavy emphasis on "12" personnel (1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs). Last season, Tampa Bay only featured "12" personnel on 20 percent of their offensive snaps, per Next Gen Stats, but the individual and collective skills of Rob Gronkowski, O.J. Howard and Cameron Brate could prompt Brady to nudge Arians to incorporate this look more in 2020. Heavy personnel packages would enable the Buccaneers to create extra gaps in the running game, while also setting up Brady for big-play chances through the air on a variety of complementary play-action passes. Considering the size, strength and athleticism of the tight ends -- as well as the stellar receiving duo of Chris Godwin and Mike Evans -- the Buccaneers could become more formidable and efficient with an old-school approach. And it makes sense when you review last year's passing output in Tampa Bay.

DETROIT -- Defying a wave of layoffs that has sent the U.S. job market into its worst catastrophe on record, at least one major industry is making a comeback: Tens of thousands of auto workers are returning to factories that have been shuttered since mid-March due to fears of spreading the coronavirus.
   
 Until now, it was mostly hair salons, restaurants, tattoo parlors and other small businesses reopening in some parts of the country. The auto industry is among the first major sectors of the economy to restart its engine.
   
 About 133,000 U.S. workers -- just over half of the industry's workforce before the pandemic -- are expected to pour back into auto plants that will open in the coming week, according to estimates by The Associated Press. In addition, parts-making companies began cranking this week to get components flowing, adding thousands more workers.
   
 Looming in the background is an economy decimated by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million laid-off U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising the total seeking aid in the past two months to about 36 million. Although some states have begun to let selected businesses reopen, workers are still reporting difficulty getting unemployment benefits. Freelance, gig and self-employed workers are struggling.
   
 Even the auto sector won't see a full return to normal yet, and if people don't start buying vehicles again, workers could be sent home. Yet automakers say there's enough pent-up demand, especially for pickup trucks, to get factories humming again.
   
 That could help states slow the drain on their unemployment benefit funds. In Michigan, where over one-third of the labor force sought benefits, the fund fell from $4.6 billion before the pandemic to $4.1 billion on April 30, said Jeff Donofrio, director of the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Some returning auto employees could work part-time and get still some unemployment benefits, but federal programs could cover part of their payments, he said.
   
 At Ford, where about 47,000 U.S. factory workers will return by next week, there's optimism that consumer demand will accompany them. Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said the company has seen sales start to recover.
   
 Ford is predicting stronger sales in the future in Europe, China and the U.S. based on data collected from new models equipped with internet modems that show the number of times an engine is turned on and off. The company found a correlation between the number of trips people take and auto sales, with trips increasing as restrictions eased.
   
 "We started to see in early April a change where people started to take more trips," Farley said Thursday. "The (sales) decline stopped and our retail sales improved a lot."
   
 Auto sales in China, where the virus peaked before the U.S., could be a harbinger of things to come. China sales fell just 2.6% in April from a year earlier, compared with a 48% free-fall in March. Production at many plants is nearly back to normal after being shut down in January and February. Volkswagen, Honda, Mercedes and Ford reported no virus cases among employees since reopening. Fiat Chrysler had two, but said the workers never entered factories.
   
 Things are worse in Europe, where sales plummeted 55% in March and some factories are running at only 40% of capacity. The pandemic has affected over 1.1 million European auto industry workers, almost half the sector's manufacturing jobs. Most are getting paid through government support. A survey of auto parts suppliers shows that a third of executives believe it will take at least two years for the industry to recover.
   
 U.S. sales fell 46% in April compared with a year ago, but analysts are forecasting a smaller decline of 30% in May. Sales have been juiced by incentives, with offers of 0% financing for seven years. Government statistics show auto production dropped over 70% in April.
   
 Pickup trucks are giving automakers the most hope, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive, a consulting firm. From January through April, total auto sales were down 21%, but pickups were only off 4%, he said.
   
 Yet Schuster says automakers could be a little too optimistic. "Those consumers who are still unemployed are not likely to be making auto purchases," he said.
   
 Some U.S. automakers, like General Motors, are restarting slowly, only bringing back workers on one shift in factories, some of which ran around the clock before the pandemic. Others, like Subaru in Indiana, have a full complement of employees.
   
 Although companies are taking precautions, one big virus outbreak at an auto plant could send the industry back into hibernation. And the industry could face parts supply interruptions from Mexico, where the government wants to reopen factories despite rising virus cases.
   
 Automakers in the U.S. are requiring employees to fill out questionnaires daily to see if they have symptoms, taking temperatures with no-touch thermometers before workers enter buildings, and requiring gloves, masks and face shields. They've also tried to keep at least six feet between workers, staggered time between shifts so workers don't interact, and put up plexiglas barriers when possible.
   
 All the steps were tested on U.S. workers who volunteered to make protective gear and breathing machines while they were laid off. Automakers say they know of no virus cases among workers in the effort.
   
 But Phil Cuthbertson a worker at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, who will return Monday, said he has mixed feelings.
   
 "I just don't want the whole thing to be pushed on us to go back if it's not safe," he said.
   
 Cindy Estrada, United Auto Workers vice president for Fiat Chrysler, said she's been impressed by the companies' safety commitment. But she's sure some workers, especially in the hard-hit Detroit area, will be fearful because family members or co-workers have had COVID-19. At least 25 UAW members employed by Detroit automakers have died from the virus, although no one is sure if they caught it at a factory.
   
 The union will be watching in case workers get infected, though there's no magic number for when it will try to close a factory, Estrada said.
   
 "If something looks like it's becoming a hot spot, then we need to act quickly and make adjustments," she said. "No one wants to see that happen."

 As states slowly emerge from stay-home orders, most discussion has rightly focused on physical safeguards for workers, customers and broader communities from COVID-19.
 But responsible loosening of the public health-related shutdown must also involve setting reasonable limits to liability for companies that have taken recommended precautions and acted in good faith.
 No one can guarantee that coronavirus transmissions won't increase -- or even spike -- with the slow resumption of commercial activity. Even a cautious reopening involves a certain degree of risk. Employers who follow all guidelines to protect employees and the public should have legal assurance that they will not be unreasonably penalized if that happens, or for making necessary changes to business operations to safeguard public health.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has vowed that no further coronavirus relief bill will see the light of day in his chamber unless it includes liability shields for businesses and employers. House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have expressed little interest, saying the focus should be on workers' rights.
 With congressional talks reportedly stalled, business owners are put in a difficult position.
 Clearly, health and safety of workers, patients and the public must be a top priority, as is a recognition that these extraordinary times place extraordinary burdens on employers and commercial enterprises. Liability shields should not protect bad actors who knowingly violate state or federal guidelines, such as the Colorado restaurant which reportedly allowed customers to sit elbow to elbow on Mother's Day. Rather, they should protect those who act in good faith to protect customers, vendors and employees from harm when much is still unknown.
 Beyond the obvious question of safe workplace requirements, several categories of potential liability have been flagged by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It warns employers could face potential claims of discrimination or violation of health privacy law when reopen plans involve testing, temperature checks or special precautions for at-risk employees. Businesses that extend public health precautions and provide protective equipment to independent contractors risk violating contracting agreements. Manufacturers that step up to produce essential products and equipment to test, treat and protect against the virus face potential product liability claims.
 There is the thorny issue of medical liability for health care facilities and providers, and lesser-known regulatory requirements, such as limitations on customer communications.
 Make no mistake, employers have a strong responsibility to protect their workers and customers. But liability should be limited if they take reasonable precautions and are transparent about potential risks.

  If you haven't heard or read by now, the news for the Redwood Valley High School Class of 2020 seems to get better every day. (Please don't let my dripping sarcasm stain your shirt.)


  First they found out in March they would be spending much of their final days as seniors at home doing their classes from a distance. Then the governor announced the remainder of the school year would be done via distance learning.


  While some held out hope that schools would be allowed to host events like prom, they, too, ultimately were cancelled. That left a lot of young ladies holding dresses they had bought with nowhere to wear them. (By the way, if you would like to show off your prom dress, you can send a photo of you in it, and I will share it with the rest of the world.)


  While all of this was happening, a group of RVHS seniors had been meeting with school leadership to talk about the most important milestone of the year - graduation. Although not preferable, a plan was put in place that would allow the class to gather together one last time at Inglis Field for a ceremony.


  While grandmas and grandpas, as well as aunts, uncles and family friends, would not be able to witness the moment they walked across the stage, at least a few immediate loved ones would be able to be there to watch them celebrate in their red caps and gowns.


  Another and final shoe fell for the senior class when the Minnesota Department of Education offered its guidance on graduation ceremonies. In essence, the state education leaders told school districts that ceremonies of any type were not going to happen regardless if they were held indoors or outdoors or if the proper six-foot berth was being observed.


  So, when graduation day arrives at the end of this month, the Redwood Valley Class of 2020 will be seated inside of vehicles in the Redwood Valley school parking lot with proper distance between vehicles. (I am wondering if convertibles will be acceptable that day.)


  As the dad of a senior, I have heard a lot of the frustration from people as they talk about what this class has missed. Of course, my Amos has no interest in it at all. In fact, if he got his diploma in the mail he would be fine with that.


  I am more than a little sad in a selfish way as it relates to this year's seniors, because I am also missing out on enjoying the final events of their time in high school. I missed out on face- to-face interviews with several potential Student Rotarians, and won't get to attend their final band and choir concerts.


  I think the fact that I have to go through the rest of this school year knowing I have already heard those last performances hurts the most.


  I will miss talking with those who would have made it to the state speech tournament. There are so many great students in this class that I have gotten to know well.


  I have been there to witness all of it. I was there the day they started Kindergarten and the day they had their debut music performance.


  I witnessed their fourth-grade graduation and saw them as fifth graders when they played together in the PAC as a band for the first time.


  I watched them as they made their way to high school and saw them grow, mature and become young men and women.


  This is a great group of people, and I am confident they are going to do great things.


  The Class of 2020 will forever be known throughout history as the class who graduated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While I know that is the reality, I do not think it is a fair assessment of them.


  What I do believe about this senior class is it is the right group of students to face it. I can say without doubt that what this class has encountered in their final days at Redwood Valley will make them stronger.


  In the future, they will be a class that sees huge successes simply because they have learned how to overcome daunting obstacles. These will be the types of people we will want working for us in the future, because they will be problem solvers.


  The rest of us need to just get out of their way.


  My wish would be that every one of these students would come back to their hometown to work and raise their families, because they will be significant influences in whatever places they call home.


  A time will come in the future when we all look back on the Class of 2020 and see them for who they really are - the group that changed the world because they would not let a little thing like a pandemic change them.

NYSDOT is utilizing its emergency structural contractor, C.P. Ward of Rochester, to restore the four-lane highway by installing a new culvert, a pipe-like structure. It will replace the culvert that washed out on June 28 during torrential rains, creating a 150-foot gap in the highway that caused the death of two truckers. The search for one of the drivers continues and NYSDOT is cooperating in that effort.
 Most of I-88 in the Southern Tier reopened Friday after being closed for two days due to flooding throughout the region. A segment of I-88 remains closed between Exit 9 at Sidney and Exit 10 in Unadilla, both in Delaware County. Route 7, which runs parallel to I-88 on the north, is serving as the detour route around that closure for all but oversized and overweight vehicles. That 7.5-mile detour takes about 20 minutes under good conditions. NYSDOT will be adding several temporary traffic signals along the route in order to improve traffic flow there.
 NYSDOT has organized a multi-disciplinary team of engineering, design, materials, and construction experts to work with the contractor on plans for cleaning up and securing the flooded I-88 site, and developing design details for the highway repair. Survey crews were on location yesterday and soon will begin to remove the damaged culvert pipe and shore up the area so that work can be done there safely.
 In order to expedite the project, its design and construction phases will overlap so that design plans can be implemented as soon as they are completed in phases, rather than waiting to start work until all plans are completed. The culvert will be prefabricated in sections and installed on site, rather than constructed on location as a single piece that would require time for multiple curings of its poured concrete.
 The contractor is in the process of moving equipment to the work site, including extensive lighting to ensure safety and enable night-time operations to further speed the work.
 Governor George E. Pataki declared a State Disaster Emergency for 13 upstate counties affected by the flooding, announced a major flood relief package, and sought federal disaster assistance for the 13 counties. President George W. Bush yesterday declared a disaster in eight counties, making federal aid available to the state and eligible local governments in Broome, Chenango, Delaware, Herkimer, Montgomery, Otsego, Sullivan and Ulster counties. The Governor has vowed to push for additional aid.
 NYSDOT crews are working around the clock to restore service to flooded roads and bridges in more than a dozen counties. Already, more than 100 segments of highway have been reopened.
 The department is working cooperatively with the State Emergency Management Office, the State Thruway and Bridge authorities, the National Guard, State Police, law enforcement and local officials to respond to the flood damage. It has deployed more than 500 of pieces of equipment to aid in the effort.
 Highlights of road openings since Wednesday include:

New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Commissioner Thomas J. Madison Jr. today announced that the Department has made significant progress in the restoration of Interstate 88 between Exits 9 and 10 in Sidney, Delaware County, where severe flooding caused the highway to wash out on June 28.
 "State Department of Transportation crews and our emergency contractor have worked 24/7 to get this road reopened since torrential flooding caused a culvert washout," Commissioner Madison said. "With Governor George E. Pataki's support, we are using every available resource to ensure that full safety and mobility are restored on Interstate 88 as soon as possible."
 NSYDOT officials held a briefing today at the site of the washout, which is expected to be repaired and reopened to traffic by early fall.
 Emergency structural contractor C.P. Ward of Rochester has been utilized to restore the four-lane highway by installing a new 42-foot culvert, a pipe-like structure. The new culvert is 18 feet high and is being installed along approximately 300 feet of Carrs Creek, which runs underneath Interstate 88.
 In order to expedite construction, the reinforced concrete culvert is being precast in five-foot sections by L H V Precast, Inc in Kingston, Ulster County. At the reconstruction site, the segments are being lifted into place by a large crane and sealed.
 The support structure for the culvert, which is made up of more than 300 piles extending up to 50 feet under ground, is nearly finished. The bottom of the culvert will be armored with large stones, which are being put into place. At the same time, a crane last week began setting segments of the arched top of the structure into place. Eventually, extensive soil work will be done to fill in a large area between the culvert and the roadway. An estimated 100,000 cubic feet of soil will be used to fill the 14- to 18-foot space, a volume of soil that would fill the area of a football field about 20 feet high.
 Crews of contractor employees and NYSDOT inspectors are working around the clock on the project, which is expected to cost up to $15 million.
 NYSDOT deemed it faster and more efficient to permanently repair the highway rather than design and construct a temporary structure that would later require a permanent replacement.
 Widespread flooding occurred after rainfall amounts in the Binghamton area exceeded historical records on June 26, 27 and 28, totaling more than 7.5 inches of rain during the three-day period. Flood waters pummeled the transportation system, leading to the closure of more than 100 roads and bridges throughout the State. Only six segments of roads and bridges remain closed.
 Engineers have inspected all culverts in the area affected by the flooding to ensure their integrity.

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

This press conference came, surely coincidentally, the day after Dr. Rick Bright, HHS’s whistleblowing former lead vaccine researcher, testified before Congress. Bright, who says he was reassigned because of his refusal to get on board Trump’s hydroxychloroquine bandwagon, also disclosed that the administration dismissed warnings in January and February about a N95 respirator-mask shortage. And said that officials lost critical time because the U.S. didn’t pressure China enough to get virus samples that could’ve aided the American response. He warned of a “dark winter” given a lack of a national strategy to counter a coronavirus resurgence.
 After Bright’s testimony, the White House suddenly produced a 2018 pandemic “preparedness report” and boasted of a 2019 pandemic “exercise.” Supposedly, these “superseded” the Obama White House’s comprehensive 69-page pandemic playbook, which Mitch McConnell claimed didn’t exist, before he admitted he got that wrong.

TPA’s report on taxpayer-funded broadband projects finds that GONs break the bank without providing reliable internet. Video and voice services provided by these government networks have been faring particularly poorly over the years because of private sector innovation and the increased use of fast and reliable cellular networks. The report notes that, from 2014 through 2018, weighted-average video penetrations (i.e. the percentage of area residents benefiting from GON video offerings) fell from 31.8 percent to 26.5 percent. Voice services, “dropped from an average usage of 23.6 percent in 2009 to 20.6 percent in 2018 as more and more customers dropped their home line and use cell phones exclusively.” And, more than 60 percent of households in areas with GONs don’t want or need government internet offerings.
 TPA’s analysis also highlights the experiences of individual GONs, some of which were sold to private providers in an attempt to recoup lost revenues. This fate befell a taxpayer-funded internet network built by Salisbury, North Carolina in 2010, which was only used by 16.7 percent of residents. The city had to borrow $40 million to construct the project but was only able to recoup about $8 million from broadband operations. Starry-eyed consultants and city planners failed to account for innovative private providers such as AT&T and Time Warner, which were able to offer better services to Salisbury consumers at competitive rates.

“From the middle of the 1920s until the beginning of the 1930s, the League of Nations, which saw the interest of aviation, imagined placing the airport under its control with a view to turning it into an instrument that would secure international relations in the event of conflict,” UN archivist Pierre- Étienne Bourneuf told the Tribune de Genève.  
 The project was never carried out for financial reasons. From 1945-1950, other international organisations moved to the city giving a boost to the airport, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the forerunner of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
 The outbreak of the Second World War put a brutal stop to commercial air traffic. Airports closed, including Geneva, but infrastructure work continued. At the end of the war, much of Europe lay in ruins, but Geneva with its long runway emerged as one of the best-equipped facilities.
 Geneva’s location in the centre of Europe was ideal for long-haul commercial flights that started in the post-war era.

About a year after Pope Francis appointed Rapid City Bishop Robert Gruss as the new bishop in Saginaw, Michigan, the pope has named the Rev. Peter Muhich (MEW-itch), a priest in the Duluth, Minnesota, diocese as bishop-elect for the bishopric that covers West River South Dakota.
 Gruss was ordained a bishop and installed in Rapid City in July 2011, serving until July 2019; he was named Saginaw’s bishop-elect in May 2019 and installed there last July.
 That’s the typical time frame between the announcement and the installation of a Catholic bishop.
 But a date for Muhich to be ordained — and then installed — as bishop in Rapid City is uncertain because of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on public services, church officials said after the announcement was made Tuesday, May 12. Public Masses and about all other public uses of churches were stopped in mid-March until further notice.
 Muhich said he has no idea yet when he might be ordained a bishop, or when he will move to Rapid City.
 “I’m looking forward to it; it’s like a new adventure,” Muhich said told the Capital Journal this week. “I’m really looking forward to moving to the south.”
 “Archbishop (Bernard) Hebda told me Bishop Gruss shot a buffalo while he was there. I don’t know if he’s telling me I have to kill a buffalo.”
 Hebda, as head of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, has some administrative responsibilities over the dioceses in the Dakotas and Minnesota, although all bishops are equal in essential ways.
 The Rapid City diocese covers the area west of the Missouri River in South Dakota, and has about 88 parishes with about 31,000 members. That constitutes about 13% of the general population of 239,000.
 It’s about as small a diocese as there is in the U.S. in terms of parish members; only the Diocese of Crookston in northwest Minnesota has as few. The Rapid City diocese has about 40 active priests.
 But two recent bishops in Rapid City have risen in the church.
 Charles Chaput, bishop in Rapid City 1988-1997, went on to be archbishop in Denver and now in Philadelphia.
 Blase Cupich, bishop in Rapid City from 1998-2010, now is Cardinal Cupich, overseeing the archdiocese of Chicago and one of only five of the Church’s cardinals in the U.S.
 Muhich, who turned 59 on Wednesday, May 13, the day after his appointment was announced, was born in Eveleth, on the Iron Range of northeast Minnesota, between Duluth and the Canadian border.
 He grew up one of seven children born to Louis and Sally Muhich in a town that’s been a hotbed of hockey and mining and Catholicism for most of a century.
 Muhich said Eveleth, when he was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, was “surrounded by mine dumps,” and bustling with the ethnic variety from immigrants from Europe.
 They came there there to wrest the iron ore out of the ground that got loaded on to ships such as the Edmund Fitzgerald at the Duluth, sailed across Lake Superior to become steel.
 Eveleth was “about two-thirds Catholic,” Muhich said of his childhood. “In a town of 4,500 to 5,000 people, there were three Catholic parishes, one for the Irish, one for the Italians and one for the Slovenians, which is my ancestry,” he said.
 “We moved when I was about 7, to the other side of town. So I would walk past the Italian church to our church and I would sneak in and attend Mass. They had an Italian-speaking priest from Chicago. And he would swear at them all the time in broken English.”
 Some of hockey’s greats have come out of Eveleth, including John Mariucci who helped found the University of Minnesota’s hockey program a century ago. And Mark Pavelich, who starred on the legendary 1980 Olympic hockey team that made “The Miracle on ice,” was in high school three years ahead of Muhich. The U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame is in Eveleth.
 “I played hockey until I was in middle school. Then I went to one sport and played football in high school. And I started working in my dad’s drug store when I was 11.”
 “My dad was a pharmacist. It was called Eveleth Pharmacy. We didn’t have a soda fountain. But we did have liquor. That was the Iron Range. We had eight bars on Main Street in Eveleth back then.”
 It was a hard-working town. His brothers and sisters worked in the family store, too.
 “My mother even did. I was paid 75 cents an hour for sweeping the floor, taking out the garbage. I had saved $12,000 by the time I was ready to go to college.”
 He attended seminary at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, an alma mater he shares with new Bishop Donald DeGrood in the Diocese of Sioux Falls; and with Cardinal Cupich.
 After graduating from St. Thomas in 1983, he studied at the American College of The Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, completing a License in Sacred Theology, an STL, that would allow him to teach in college.
 Muhich was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Duluth on Sept. 19, 1989 and has for the past 11 years served as rector of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary in Duluth.
 The Duluth diocese suddenly was without a bishop recently: Bishop Paul David Sirba died of a heart attack at 59 on Dec. 1 after serving a decade as bishop.
 Muhich has been involved for years in leadership positions in the Duluth diocese which comprises 56,000 Catholics in 92 parishes in northeast Minnesota. Sirba’s death meant Muhich went along as a representative from Duluth with bishops from the region in a visit to Rome to meet with Pope Francis earlier this year.
 There was no particular priest Muhich looks back on as influencing him especially toward the priesthood.
 “It was just seeing a lot of different priests, seeing them as a normal part of life. So it was normal to think about being one, possibly.”
 His mother and father were devout Catholics and would invite the parish priest over for dinner regularly.
 “My father had considered going to seminary when he was still in pharmacy school. But he was dating my mother at the same time and she won!”
 That makes it especially meaningful for his parents, now in their mid-80s, to have a son about to become a bishop.
 “My brothers and sisters are just like any brothers and sisters. They give me a hard time.”
 Muhich hopes all his family can attend his ordination, whenever it gets scheduled. “But it’s hard to know with this coronavirus thing,” he said.
 The Rev. James Bissonette, administrator of the Duluth diocese, told the Catholic World magazine that Muhich will make a good bishop.
 “I know him to be a very good person, an exemplary priest and a fine friend,” Bissonette said. “He is kind and considerate, with a keen mind, leadership qualities and a strong, steady faith.”
 Cardinal Blase Cupich in Chicago touched base with Muhich already.
 “He called me the other day. He was very kind and told me Rapid City was his first diocese and that he just wanted to congratulate me.”
 Muhich described his childhood faith and interest in the priesthood as happening well before the child abuse scandals in the church that came to public attention beginning in the 1980s.
 Now that reality will be part of his work in Rapid City, he said.
 “It has to be part of every bishop’s ministry,” Muhich told the Capital Journal. “To make sure we are doing everything possible to prevent the abuse of children by anybody, especially by priests, for God’s sake. Making sure the church is a safe place for all, working to prevent any abuse and, if, God forbid, it should happen, to cooperate with law enforcement and let them do their job.”
 Muhich said he has no idea when he will be ordained a bishop and installed because of the way the COVID-19 pandemic has stopped normal church activities. A bishop’s ordination and installation normally involves many bishops and church officials traveling to attend.
 Until that ceremony can be scheduled, the Rev. Michel Mulloy will continue as administrator, in charge of the Rapid City diocese, Mulloy said this week.
 Only a bishop can ordain new priests or assign pastors to a term in a parish, but things can keep on for now as they have since July, Mulloy said.
 Muhich said he likely will move to Rapid City to live in the bishop’s residence even before he finds out when his ordination will take place.
 “At some point this summer, I’m sure I will make the move. We are still talking about that. I can start to get to know everyone. And it’s going to be odd if I’m sitting in Duluth for many months. I may as well move there.”

"We had 150 masks when we opened up today," said Wexford Community Credit Union Executive Assistant Melissa Kuhns on Tuesday. "We were out at noon."


  The credit union locations in Cadillac and Lake City were among the first financial institutions to hand out masks using their drive-thru lanes.


  "We were already set up for no-contact exchanges," Kuhns said.


  The idea to use banks as mask distribution centers was spearheaded by community leader Margo Jacobs, who approached the credit union and asked them if they were on board with the plan. Once the credit union signed off on the idea, the work of securing enough masks to fill the demand in the community began.


  Jacobs reached out to a couple organizations in the area she had heard were making homemade masks, including the Cadillac Senior Center and the regional Facebook group, Seamstresses for Safety.


  These connections proved invaluable, as volunteers from each group immediately started dropping off homemade masks to the credit union, Jacobs said.


  "I think it gives people with a giving spirit a lot of joy producing something that will actually be used," Jacobs said.


  Cadillac Senior Center Director Diane Patterson said there are a handful of seniors at the center that spend a lot of time making masks. So far, she estimates they've produced more than 300, some of which go to other seniors in the community and others to entities such as the Wex Express and credit union.


  The credit union (which only has drive-thru hours of operation right now) set aside some time from 10 a.m. to noon when mask-sewing volunteers could knock on the lobby doors and drop off finished masks for distribution.

 "He persuaded Nigel Stephenson to come back to the club from Wakefield Trinity and Jack’s leadership and astute coaching ensured that Dewsbury ended the season with promotion to the top division.
 "The following season, in the top flight, saw Jack recruit Neil Kelly and so started an association and later friendship that was to last through the rest of Jack’s life.
 "Without the funds to compete with the “big boys”, Jack ensured that the team could compete in the elite league."
 After that Jack decided to move to Huddersfield for a similar role and let new blood move in at Dewsbury.
 However, he took on his role as head coach again in December 1990.

 England, Spain and Italy all remain hopeful of completing the season but ongoing concerns about the health crisis mean nothing is set in stone.
 The UK and Italy have been the worst affected countries in Europe by the pandemic and Spain is not far behind.
 Nevertheless, the English Premier League and second-tier Championship are targeting a mid-June restart. Other countries hoping to be able to resume are:
 Romania -- May 27
 Poland -- May 29
 Spain -- June 12
 Italy -- June 13
 Greece -- June 14

 \- Season over -
 The Netherlands became the first European country to bring an early end to the season on April 24 as the Eredivisie was cancelled without a champion being crowned.
 France then followed suit on April 30, ending the season with 10 rounds of matches unplayed.
 The season was not voided, though, with Paris Saint-Germain confirmed as champions, European places dished out and relegation and promotion between the top two divisions maintained on a two-up, two-down basis.
 On Friday Belgium confirmed its season was over, with Club Brugge champions, after the Belgian government announced last week it was suspending all sporting competitions until July 31.
 In Scotland the season has already been called early in the three divisions below the top flight and the Premiership is on the verge of doing the same, which would mean Celtic being crowned champions.
 Cyprus called an end to its season on Friday without naming a champion, although European places were attributed with Omonia Nicosia entering the qualifying rounds of the next Champions League.

STARKVILLE, Miss. - Ron Polk, legendary Mississippi State baseball coach and the winningest coach in the history of the Southeastern Conference, will return to MSU as Special Assistant to the Athletic Director, it was announced Wednesday. “This is a great day for the Hail State Family to welcome Ron Polk back home,” Director of Athletics John Cohen said. “His experience, institutional knowledge, passion for Mississippi State and the high level of respect he holds around college athletics will be a tremendous resource to our coaches, student-athletes and entire athletics program.” “Mississippi State is a special place, and this is home for me,” Polk said. “After 54 years of coaching college baseball, including the last 12 as a volunteer assistant at UAB, this is a perfect time for me to give back to Mississippi State. I’m very appreciative to this great university and Director of Athletics John Cohen for allowing me to do this. From meeting with and being available to our coaches in different capacities, to development, alumni speaking events, serving on committees, or occasional radio and television broadcasts, I can’t wait to promote and assist in any way I can to help the Bulldogs continue to be one of the best athletic programs in the country.” Polk spent the previous 12 seasons at UAB under head coach Brian Shoop, a former MSU assistant under Polk who announced his retirement earlier this week. Polk will continue to spend his summers coaching in the Cape Cod summer league as an assistant coach, after volunteering with MSU Athletics during the school year. A two-time National Coach of the Year and four-time SEC Coach of the Year, Polk spent 29 seasons leading the MSU baseball program (1976-1997, 2002-2008). He currently ranks ninth all-time in NCAA Division I career head coach victories. Polk concluded his 35-year career as a head coach with a record of 1,373-700-2 (.662) and produced 35 All-Americans and more than 75 All-SEC performers. During his career, which also included stints at Georgia Southern (1972-75) and Georgia (2000-01), Polk led his teams to a total of eight College World Series appearances, five SEC Championships and 23 Regional appearances. He is one of only three coaches in college baseball history to take three different programs to the College World Series. At MSU, Polk recruited and coached some of the game’s all-time greats including MLB standouts Jeff Brantley, Will Clark, Rafael Palmeiro, Bobby Thigpen and Jonathan Papelbon. In July 2009, Polk was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1995. In 1988, he was presented with the Lefty Gomez Award, the highest award given by the ABCA. In addition to Polk’s work in the collegiate ranks, he has completed seven tours as a member of the coaching staff for the USA National Baseball Team, twice serving as head coach. Two of the teams he coached represented the United States in the Olympics. The inaugural class of the Ron Polk Ring of Honor was unveiled in 2019 in the Adkerson Plaza, located at the right field entrance to Dudy Noble Field.

Three persons from Kozhikode in Kerala were killed and two others sustained injuries after a sports utility vehicle (SUV) they were travelling by collided with a stationary tipper truck on Hyderabad-Nagpur national highway (NH-44) in Telangana's Nizamabad district in the early hours of Saturday, the police said.
 The deceased were identified as Anesh (32), Stalin (21), and Analia (15). The injured - Divya (27) and Alekhya (5) - are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Nizamabad.
 Though it was initially suspected that the victims were migrant labourers, later the police found out that they were working for a school in Bihar's Nawada town.
 "They belong to Kozhikode in Kerala. The victims, along with 10 other people, were returning to their native place in three vehicles because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak," G Venkateshwarlu, the inspector of police, Dichpalli, told HT.
 "The victims were travelling in an SUV at a high speed, when the driver lost control and rammed into a tipper truck at Mentrajpalli village under Dichpalli block at around 4 am on Saturday," the inspector said.
 "The tipper truck had met with an accident the previous day a few kilometres away and was being towed away by another vehicle. It came to a halt at Metrajpalli suddenly due to decoupling between the two vehicles. Even before the driver of the towing vehicle could get off, the SUV came at a high speed and rammed into the tipper from behind," he added.
 While Anesh, his daughter Analia, and Stalin, another school teacher, who was driving the vehicle, died on the spot, Anesh's wife Divya and another daughter Alekhya, who were sleeping on the back seat, were injured in the accident.
 "We've registered a case and a probe is being conducted," Venkateshwarlu said.
 In another separate accident on the same NH-44 a couple of hours later, 20 people were injured after a truck, carrying around 50 migrant labourers from Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, fell off the road into a gorge at Kondapur village of Nirmal district, the police said.
 The condition of nine of the migrant labourers, who were returning to their native place from Hyderabad, is said to be serious.
 The police said the accident occurred at around 6 am when the speeding lorry hit the railing on the left side of the national highway and fell into the adjacent gorge. The injured were admitted to the government hospital in Nirmal.
 State endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy, who belongs to Nirmal, visited the accident spot and supervised the rescue operations. He has assured the best possible treatment to the injured.

For the millions of workers stuck at home, having a stable, reliable internet connection is more important than ever. Private providers have led the way to keep America connected.
 In addition to the hundreds of billions of dollars invested by the private sector, far-sighted federal and state regulatory reform has made the digital domain stronger than ever. But unfortunately, local governments across the country are eager to sideline these providers by building expensive, poorly targeted government owned (i.e. taxpayer-funded) networks (GONs) of their own.
 According to the Taxpayers Protection Alliance’s (TPA) recently released report “GON With the Wind,” GONs only reach about a third of potential broadband consumers living in the municipalities that have built these networks. But all residents of said municipalities must foot the bill for these boondoggles, resulting in sky-high expenses for taxpayers. It’s time for local leaders to ditch GON projects and empower private providers to keep America connected.

However, it would not be the first time that someone would have heard this as a former DEA agent, Hector Berrellez is believed to have connected these dots when the investigation was handed to him. However, his claims were shot down when he initially made this information public.

The upshot is that, according to the court, DHS lacked the authority to issue the emergency order — and the order therefore lacked the force of law. Its criminal sanctions — a nominal fine or up to 30 days in jail for breaking it — were held to be invalid and the order was rendered unenforceable.

 Wisconsin law says, among other things, that DHS “may authorize and implement all emergency measures necessary to control communicable diseases.” It says that DHS “may promulgate and enforce rules or issue orders ... for the control and suppression of communicable diseases.” This statutory language makes it crystal clear that DHS can issue emergency orders as well as rules crafted under the required, lengthy administrative process.

L’imprenditore che applica alla lettera i protocolli di sicurezza non deve rischiare un processo penale se il proprio dipendente è stato contagiato dal Covid-19 sul luogo di lavoro. Sulla richiesta di Confindustria, in particolare del suo vicepresidente con delega per il lavoro e le relazioni industriali, Maurizio Stirpe, c’è già stata un’apertura del ministro Nunzia Catalfo, che nei prossimi giorni si confronterà con le parti sociali per delineare la corretta cornice interpretativa delle linee guida per la “fase 2” dell’emergenza sanitaria. Ora arriva anche una precisazione dell’Inail, che cerca di sgombrare il campo da possibili equivoci. Secondo l’istituto l’infortunio sul lavoro per Covid-19 non è collegato alla responsabilità penale e civile dell’impresa. Il datore di lavoro, spiega, risponde penalmente e civilmente delle infezioni di origine professionale solo se viene accertata la propria responsabilità per dolo o per colpa. “E’ utile precisare – dice l’Inail – che dal riconoscimento come infortunio sul lavoro non discende automaticamente l’accertamento della responsabilità civile o penale in capo al datore di lavoro”. Le responsabilità, dunque, devono essere “rigorosamente accertate, attraverso la prova del dolo o della colpa del datore di lavoro, con criteri totalmente diversi da quelli previsti per il riconoscimento del diritto alle prestazioni assicurative Inail”, aggiunge l’istituto. Pertanto, il riconoscimento dell’infortunio “non assume alcun rilievo per sostenere l’accusa in sede penale”, neanche in sede civile tenuto conto che è sempre necessario l’accertamento della colpa per aver causato l’evento dannoso. Secondo la Cgil il chiarimento dell’Inail è un fatto positivo, tuttavia molte questioni restano ancora aperte. “Riteniamo utile il chiarimento – sottolinea il segretario confederale Rossana Dettori – che riprende e riafferma i corretti profili di responsabilità nel contesto dell’epidemia da Covid-19, ma che erano già presenti e ben consolidati nel nostro ordinamento civile e penale e nel Testo unico sulla salute e sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro. Vogliamo però ribadire come per quanto riguarda le tutele e le prestazioni previste per i lavoratori siamo ancora di fronte a rilievi problematici molto preoccupanti. Abbiamo letto con qualche sorpresa l’intervista rilasciata nelle scorse ore dal presidente Franco Bettoni, nella quale affermava come per riconoscere l’infortunio in caso di contagio del virus l’Inail richiedesse una documentazione molto precisa dell’occasione e della modalità del contagio”. La confederazione di corso d’Italia ritiene che questo contraddica quanto affermato dallo stesso istituto in una sua circolare, pubblicata qualche settimana fa, che “assegnava il meccanismo di presunzione semplice, cioè un riconoscimento pressochè automatico – conclude Dettori – a lavoratori dei settori cosiddetti essenziali che hanno continuato a fare il loro dovere e che nulla diceva in merito a tutti i contagi nelle aziende derogate dai prefetti e nei settori non esplicitamente citati in quel documento”. La comunicazione dell’Inail “sgombra il campo da ogni ambiguità rispetto alle comprensibili preoccupazioni di Confindustria sulle eventuali responsabilità connesse al contagio Covid-19 – dichiara il segretario generale aggiunto della Cisl, Luigi Sbarra – la legge prevede che il datore di lavoro risponda civilmente o penalmente solo in caso di dolo o colpa dimostrati. L’indennizzo o il procedimento scattano solo in caso venga comprovato il nesso con l’eventuale negligenza dell’impresa rispetto alla concreta applicazione della norma e dei protocolli su salute e sicurezza. Un principio sacrosanto, che tutela le aziende in linea con le regole e che sono oggi la quasi totalità. Parliamo di aziende che potrebbero subire la concorrenza sleale delle poche imprese, che invece non rispettano le norme, mettendo a rischio la salute delle persone. Le parti sociali hanno dato prova di assoluta responsabilità concertando misure importanti per la sicurezza e la salute nei luoghi di lavoro con i protocolli per il contenimento della pandemia. I contenuti delle intese sottoscritte vanno rigorosamente attuate e applicate nelle aziende per fare dei luoghi di lavoro le realtà più sicure”. Anche per la Uil la precisazione dell’Inail è “importante – afferma il segretario confederale Silvana Roseto – perché dissipa i dubbi e smorza le polemiche: l’indennizzo non ha affatto un intento persecutorio del datore di lavoro, quanto piuttosto di garanzia e di tutela del lavoratore. Lo spirito deve essere quello della collaborazione e della responsabilità. Le aziende devono adottare tutte le misure di sicurezza previste. Peraltro – aggiunge – il protocollo di marzo, integrato ad aprile, prevede che la mancata attuazione di quelle misure comporti la sospensione dell’attività, proprio per consentire il necessario adeguamento”.

Western Europeans, in particular, may be puzzled by this kind of calculus, but that is merely the result of Europe’s own economically transactional approach when it comes to China, which has prioritized business ties and had leaders look the other way as China has thrown its weight around in its neighborhood. For countries on the receiving end of Chinese coercion, a tougher U.S. line on China is more important than any other aspect of U.S. policy. Asian elites—in Taipei, Manila, Hanoi, New-Delhi—increasingly calculate that Trump’s unpredictable and transactional approach is a lesser evil compared to the danger of the United States going back to cajoling China to be a “responsible stakeholder.” A prominent pundit went so far as to assert that “Asian elites have grown oddly sanguine about a Trump second term.”

It's uncommon for a two-win organization to have a blue-chip running back (Joe Mixon) and a pair of top-tier pass catchers (A.J. Green and Tyler Boyd) already in the fold. Not to mention, Cincy spent the first pick of the second round on Clemson WR Tee Higgins, a big-bodied vertical playmaker who's excellent on 50-50 balls. That's plenty of firepower at the skill positions. On the line, the Bengals essentially add another first-round pick in Jonah Williams, the 11th overall pick from the 2019 NFL Draft who missed all of last season after injuring his shoulder during team activities in June. Williams, who was the first offensive lineman selected in last year's draft, slots in at left tackle. Although questions persist about the Alabama product's ability to emerge as a five-star blind-side protector, given his less-than-ideal physical tools, the Bengals are betting on Williams' polished technique and competitiveness to enable him to hold his own against superior athletes on the edge.

The world is going through a deep crisis. Now, how you describe the effects and the challenges that the ongoing pandemic has presented completely depends on the vantage point from which you are looking at this crisis. It’s likely to be different if you are rich or poor, young or old, affected or unaffected, dependent or self-reliant and even men or women. When it comes to sports, how an athlete looks at and reacts to a crisis is vastly different from an administrator. For example, in the current scenario an athlete would be most likely worried about the lack of training and competitions, and restrictions on the movement (the last one applies to most of the people). On the other hand, for administrators like Adille Sumariwalla, president of the Athletics Federation of India, “the biggest worry is (how) to keep our athletes safe and how they can start their training in a systematic and scheduled manner, following all protocols.” It’s been almost two months since the sporting activities in India were put on hold due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which has caused the death of over 2,500 people and infected more than 80,000 in the country (by Thursday, May 14). With the pandemic affecting the entire world and forcing all the major domestic and international events to either be cancelled or postponed — including the Olympic Games in Tokyo which have been deferred by a year — the athletes have either returned to their homes or staying in camps at the various Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres with no access to training facilities. It has severely affected the training schedules of the athletes. The sports federations, along with the SAI, are trying to keep athletes busy through various programmes that are mostly aimed at helping them maintain a basic fitness level, keeping them motivated and ensuring their mental well-being. “We need to treat it as yet another challenge and find constructive ways to keep up with our goals and ensure our teams' (both men’s and women’s) preparations for the Olympic Games continues,” said Elena Norman, Hockey India CEO. “We are thankful to the SAI, for ensuring a safe environment for our players who have been based in their Bengaluru centre since the lockdown. The teams have been able to maintain their fitness levels as they have been following individual programmes,” she added. Financial Strain Technology has come to everyone’s aid as administrators, coaches and athletes are able to maintain regular contact while also following social-distancing norms. All the instructions, follow-ups and feedbacks are being done on video conferencing. But technology may not be able to save the sports federations from the financial impact of the pandemic. Yes, the technology will help in taking the sport to its fans in the post- pandemic world where social distancing might become the new normal keeping the spectators away from the stadiums. It won’t, however, bring as much money as it used to as the sponsors might themselves be in a precarious financial situation. “It is still premature to estimate the financial implications Covid-19 has had on hockey or sports in general,” Norman said. “It's always best to have a positive outlook, no matter what the crisis is. This is something sports teaches everyone associated with it.” But Ajay Kumar Singhania, general secretary of the Badminton Association of India, was more forthcoming about the financial impact. “Yes, it will definitely affect the finances,” Singhania said. “I am not sure how we will find sponsors. But that’s not restricted to badminton. Every sport will face the same problems. “Yonex is our main sponsor for the India Open. It’s a Japanese company and that country is also badly affected by this pandemic. They are also under lockdown. There is no sale as far as sports products are concerned. Even most other sectors are all closed. So, everyone will face a crisis in terms of finances. “Sponsors are the main source of earning for us. Whatever we get from SAI, that goes into players’ training, exposure trips, camps etc. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) doesn’t get anything from that. The BAI totally depends on the money it gets from sponsors.” Sumariwalla also expects a financial crunch but he is not much worried as Indian sportspersons and teams get some funds from the government. “If everything goes down, we all will go down. (In that sense) everybody is worried. I am a businessman, I am worried. I have to pay salaries, there is not a rupee business in the last two months. It’s a global thing. Millions of people will lose their jobs. At least our athletes are not going to lose jobs, they all have government jobs. So, they are safe and protected,” Sumaraiwalla, who represented India at the 1980 Moscow Olympics in 100m, said. “We will survive. Although we get zero money from the government but our athletes’ programmes are looked after by the government. So, if the government is paying directly to the coaches, to athletes for their training, providing camp facilities, what more do we want? For us, the most important thing is the athlete. If the athlete is being looked after, the rest of the expenses we will manage.” Uncertain Future Their job is made tougher by the continuously developing situation and the uncertainty around the future. What sort of world will emerge from this crisis is a question that nobody can answer at the moment. “There are no concrete plans as of now because there is no clarity about the situation,” Singhania said. “Even our offices are all closed. All our meetings with the ministry or SAI are done on video conferencing. Our president (Himanta Biswa Sarma), who is also the health minister of Assam, is busy in relief work in Assam. The first thing on everybody’s mind is how to get rid of this disease. Some vaccine or some way to control this virus is urgently needed because everything is inter-connected and if one thing is disturbed, it affects all other things,” he added. Sumariwalla said, “I don’t really know how it’s going to change (sports) yet because we don’t know the end of it. “Only when you come to know the end or you are closer to the end — whether the lockdown will be lifted or not lifted, whether the people will be allowed to go out or not, what will happen to the social distancing — you can’t say. So, it’s a bit too early (to say anything). “Maybe things stay the same. What if we find the vaccine tomorrow, everyone gets vaccinated and everything becomes okay. It’s over. A lot of things have happened before this but nothing changed. Spanish Flu happened for two whole years and then the whole world went back to normal after two years.” Waiting Game All the sports federations are in regular contact with the government through the sports ministry and are exploring ways to restart training of the athletes as soon as possible. So far, everything is on paper as the country continues to struggle with the virus. On their part, however, the sports federations have submitted detailed plans. Now, it all depends on the government guidelines. The easing of curbs in Lockdown 4 may bring some cheer for the federations and athletes. “Earlier this week, the sports minister (Kiren Rijiju) spent over two hours talking to our athletes, asking them for any problems or issues that they have. The singular issue that came out of that meeting was that they want to start training. So, that’s that. We have given a schedule to sports ministry to take it to ministry of home affairs to basically how we are going to train in small numbers. They are anyway living together in camps, eating together, maintaining social distancing, and this is the same thing they will do while training. We have got three tracks – grass, blue and red – we have got a separate gym and then we are going to stagger timing for all these people so that not more than a few athletes will be training on the track at the same time,” Sumariwalla said. “We need to take one step at a time as circumstances keep changing. For now, we have submitted a plan to SAI a couple of weeks back on what we can do effectively in the coming months for the national teams / athletes. We will work within the FIH guidelines on the sport and GOI recommendations to ensure that our hockey players can get back onto the field in some form,” Norman said. “We want all four of our Tokyo Olympics qualified shuttlers till date – PV Sindhu, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, Sai Praneeth — and other top players, who have the chance to qualify, to be able to train. If the SAI centres can be opened for our top players, they can train there. The players have approached us and we have also forwarded their requests to SAI. The sports minister told us to wait till May end. But again, it all depends on the situation in the country,” Singhania said.

Beth was a proud Sudburian at heart and was born into an extended family with 3 generations living under one roof. She was a quick learner and as a child acquired tailoring skills from her Orcadian grandfather, Thomas Linklater, who ran a very popular tailor shop in Sudbury for many years specializing in men's hats, suits and furnishings. When he became blind and deaf in one ear Beth became aware of how hearing loss can profoundly affect a person's communication and she worked diligently to communicate with her Grandpapa. As their eldest child, her parents, Barbara and Gordon instilled in her and her brother Grant the Presbyterian family values of responsibility, compassion, respect and kindness. At Laurentian University, Beth, a bright student, completed an undergraduate degree in Psychology. Along with fellow student, Jean-Pierre Gagne, Beth took courses in Sensation and Perception and Psychology of Hearing with Dr. R. H. Farrant who persuaded both of them to pursue a degree in Audiology. She completed a Master of Clinical Science (Audiology) Degree and later a PhD in the Faculty of Health Sciences at Western University in London, ON. J.-P. Gagne also obtained his PhD and subsequently became the Director of the École d'orthophonie et d'audiologie at the Université de Montréal. Over the years, both J.-P. and Beth collaborated on several research articles. Beth was a pioneer in her field in that she recognized that hearing technology was the start of a person's hearing rehabilitation. She started work as an audiologist at the Canadian Hearing Society in Toronto where she developed and ran hearing help classes for adults with hearing loss. She was the driving force in providing an Elderhostel program that ran for 10 years. Through therapeutic community-based aural rehabilitation programs Beth encouraged individuals living with hearing loss to overcome their difficulties in understanding speech and improve their communication skills in the workplace, and in real-life social environments such as restaurants, sporting events, concerts, and theatre outings. On secondment from C.H.S., Beth participated in a research project in Dundas, ON that focused on hearing rehabilitation programmes in retirement homes. That project is what sparked her interest in research. Beth was as an Associate Professor and for the past 20 years a faculty member in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Western University and an Associate in the National Centre for Audiology. Beth supervised, mentored and 'mothered' many Master of Clinical Science students in Aural Rehabilitation practicums as well as several MSc and PhD students. Beth provided significant contributions to audiology research, and the training of audiology and speech-language pathology students world-wide, but especially in Canada. Even in her last years, she remained a strong and committed research supervisor, editing a dissertation between surgery and rounds of chemotherapy. Her work in adult aural rehabilitation, family-centred care and counselling, innovations in workplace accessibility and participation for persons with hearing loss, social stigma and universal design for hearing loss is well known. Beth was highly regarded within the global audiological community and was a frequent invited speaker at Canadian and international conferences where she shared her friendship, research and clinical knowledge. Beth was an innovative practitioner, researcher, teacher and her legacy is vast. Beth collaborated and published over 50 articles, and many book chapters, including one just recently published. Beth did her very best, every moment, to create a better future for people living with hearing loss. Many adults with hearing loss lead more active and participatory lives due to her insight, empathy, and wisdom. She will be greatly missed by all those who knew her. During her career she developed many lasting friendships with colleagues in Canada, U.S.A., Europe and Australia. She was always the first on board to plan the menus for family events and the first caller online to book season tickets for the Stratford and Shaw Festivals which was an annual family outing. She maintained her skills in the rag trade and knitted many intricate patterned garments and took up felting just this past year. A keen reader, she proposed to read a huge collection of literature during her illness. Her hidden talents included playing piano and bagpipes, figure skating, culinary artist, tap dancer, orchid grower and want-to-be archeologist. Predeceased by her mother Barbara (Linklater), she will be forever remembered by Craig, her partner, Gordon, her father, her brother Grant (Christine), nephew Collin and nieces Brittany and Brianne. She will be missed by many in-laws, relatives, friends, and work colleagues. A huge round of applause goes out to the entire healthcare team that allowed Beth to spend her last 7 weeks in the comfort of her home during very challenging times. This includes her PSW, Maria, the LHIN Co-ordinator Susan Arnold, Dr. Namita Kanwar, and the nursing staff including Ewa, Florence, Sara and Paolo who along with the medication injected a shot of compassion and kindness. We also owe a great debt of gratitude to Dr.'s Orsini, Bertrand and Oncologists Dr. Welsh and Dr. D'Souza, and all the nurses and staff at the London Regional Cancer Program and the Oncology Unit at Victoria Hospital. Beth valued and appreciated the patience, understanding and support from everyone who helped her during her illness, this includes the many family, friends, and neighbours who supported her on her journey. Many thanks to the women at St. James Lutheran Church in New Dundee for handcrafting the finely knitted prayer blanket that provided Beth with great comfort. A service and interment at Parklawn Cemetery in Sudbury are being planned for a later date. Arrangements entrusted with A. Millard George Funeral Home, 519-433-5184.

You can almost see a few parallels popping up every now and then during our time of trial in the era of COVID — the acronym for COrona VIrus Disease. The parallels don’t present in the disease itself, because the plague was far deadlier. It was the economic changes that came about because of the Black Death.
 Basically, there was no middle class during the Middle Ages. Oh, there was, but they were quite small compared to today’s society. There were the lords and landed gentry, and there were serfs and peasants. You know, an expendable class that did all the work and provided wealth to the rich. It was a great system for the wealthy at the time, a subsistence-only way of life for everyone else.
 But history, economics and in this case disease, turned the world almost on its head. So many peasants died of the plague, along with a fair amount of people of wealth, that the agrarian economy that prevailed during this time in history began to lose a large number of its manual, menial workers. Who tilled and toiled in the fields? Serfs and peasants did, in order to feed themselves and their families and very, very, very little else.
 But when the butcher’s bill came, and workers died by the millions, there were fewer and fewer people left to provide labor the wealthy required to, well, stay wealthy.
 In fact, so many laborers died that those who survived the plague actually had grown greatly in worth to the upper economic class, such that their labors were only gained by those who paid the most. More and more wealthy nobles were forced to actually get out into their fields and their lands and work the ground, help with the raising of crops and the harvest.
 It was as if that part of the world that had royal houses and nobles had to actually appreciate the working class for the first time.
 Not that it anyway compares to today’s workforce, but Americans have seen first-hand that those who labor behind the scenes in our great economy have far more worth that many realized.
 Unless you are among them, do you think of farmers when you eat, stockers in groceries, truckers, people who toil behind the scenes in hospitals and clean up after us and on and on — did you really think about these unsung heroes much before COVID-19?
 Maybe ... the last will be first, and the first will be last.
 I’m sure I read that somewhere.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Cephas Gilbert says he is visited daily by old buddies. For years, the same flock of red chickens and roosters hung outside his Cephas Hot Shop restaurant at 1701 Fourth Avenue in Ybor City. Then, in February, he said goodbye to his feathery friends when he opened a juice bar under the same name a few blocks over at 1613 Seventh Ave. But he says some of those birds have been hanging around his business lately. “They miss me,” Gilbert said with a laugh. Well, not really. Chickens famously find all sorts of reasons to cross the road, but most of the Ybor fowl have historically stayed away from Seventh Avenue due to its high volume of cars and people. Then came the shutdown of most Ybor businesses to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Seventh Avenue was suddenly chicken friendly and they made their way to the main thoroughfare. “You see more here now than ever,” said Gilbert, who has been in Ybor since 1981. “It’s nice.” Photos of animals claiming spaces throughout the world during the pandemic have spread via social media — monkeys in New Delhi, mountain goats in Wales. But the Ybor chickens did not initially follow suit. The birds are animals of habit, said Dylan Breese, founder of the Ybor Chickens Society that cares for the wild fowl. Flocks stick to their certain areas. Some live in Centennial Park, for instance, and others in the vacant lots that dot Fifth Avenue between 19th and 20th streets. “They don’t venture out because that is where they feel safe,” Breese said. “If they venture into another chicken’s territory, that is when fights happen.” But then people ventured back onto Seventh Avenue for takeout food that they would eat on walks. “My wife and I...

THE MDC Alliance must not ring-fence those who want to join the Zanu PF jamboree fronted by Thokozani Khupe, Douglas Mwonzora, Morgen Komichi and Elias Mudzuri.      They must do so freely and there is no need to stop them. You do not need a rocket scientist to tell you that they have been planted by the regime just to cause confusion. Legislators who are ideologically bankrupt, unpatriotic and who do not know the cause should leave.      The majority of people should start wondering why the late found-ing leader Morgan Tsvangirai was finding it difficult to win all these years he contested. Of course, allegations of rigging cannot be completely ignored, but it is now crystal dear that there are machinations meant to scuttle and disturb every move, when the ball is just in the penalty area.      Members of the opposition who want to serve the people must be objective, self-centred and pragmatic.      Those who want to go should do so in good faith. Like people who want to move from one house to another, they should do so in broad daylight when all the people are watching. They should not cover their faces like Boko Haram activists which is about to strike.      The Bible says in the year that King Uziah died, I saw the Lord" So such people must go for the people to get their freedom. It is difficult for people to wrap their heads around the numerous ways of their lives, this entire country would feel more stable, secure, and directed right, if people were allowed to vote for the leaders of their choice. Right now there is chaos in the MDC Alliance because of the implications of the Supreme Court judgment and the fundamental rights of the voters.      Voters are not experts in law interpretation and do not have a say in the judgment. Why did the nomination court allow the MDC Alliance to register their name and later, the Supreme Court sending another judgment two years later?      I have been closely watching how our courts are operating and I have concluded that we have lost the radar. The country has lost its judicial, political decency, morales, respect, integrity, ethical, and nondiscriminatory foundation.

The New Hanover County Senior Resource Center has received a $25,000 grant from Meals on Wheels America for its food delivery program, which now delivers two meals per weekday in light of challenges posed by COVID-19.


   


  "With the stay at home order and social distancing efforts, we found that families were not able to visit their loved ones," said SRC Director Amber Smith. "That made it harder for families who normally provide other meals to homebound seniors."


   


  Since the late 1970s, the SRC's meal program has been delivering meals to seniors homebound by physical or cognitive limitations.


   


  It is currently serving more than 5,500 meals per week, with funds from the federal Older Americans Act and state Home and Community Care Block Grant, which the county matches.


   


  "Each meal has a protein (beef, chicken or pork), a fruit or vegetable and a carton of milk for calcium," said SRC Nutrition Program Manger Ellen Conner, adding that the criteria is set by the Older Americans Act. "Meals are required to have at least 700 calories and have restrictions for sodium."


   


  Prior to the outbreak, the SRC relied on volunteers to deliver one meal per senior Monday through Friday. But according to Smith, "about 80% of our volunteer base were older adults themselves," who stepped back to "protect their health."


   


  In their place, the SRC has turned to other volunteers and the county has enlisted Library and Department of Social Service employees, who are compensated for their time.


   


  Due to social distancing measures, the SRC has also replaced its congregant meal option, which served lunch in its dining hall, with a drive-thru pick-up option at four facilities.


   


  "You do have to be 60 years or older and first time individuals have to fill out a form required by the state, which we have onsite," said Smith. She asked that those intending to come call in advance at 910-798-6420.

As states slowly emerge from stay-home orders, most discussion has rightly focused on physical safeguards for workers, customers and broader communities from COVID-19.
   
 But responsible loosening of the public health-related shutdown must also involve setting reasonable limits to liability for companies that have taken recommended precautions and acted in good faith.
   
 No one can guarantee that coronavirus transmissions won't increase -- or even spike -- with the slow resumption of commercial activity. Even a cautious reopening involves a certain degree of risk. Employers who follow all guidelines to protect employees and the public should have legal assurance that they will not be unreasonably penalized if that happens, or for making necessary changes to business operations to safeguard public health.
   
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has vowed that no further coronavirus relief bill will see the light of day in his chamber unless it includes liability shields for businesses and employers. House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have expressed little interest, saying the focus should be on workers' rights.
   
 With congressional talks reportedly stalled, business owners are put in a difficult position.
   
 Clearly, health and safety of workers, patients and the public must be a top priority, as is a recognition that these extraordinary times place extraordinary burdens on employers and commercial enterprises. Liability shields should not protect bad actors who knowingly violate state or federal guidelines, such as the Colorado restaurant which reportedly allowed customers to sit elbow to elbow on Mother's Day. Rather, they should protect those who act in good faith to protect customers, vendors and employees from harm when much is still unknown.
   
 Beyond the obvious question of safe workplace requirements, several categories of potential liability have been flagged by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It warns employers could face potential claims of discrimination or violation of health privacy law when reopen plans involve testing, temperature checks or special precautions for at-risk employees. Businesses that extend public health precautions and provide protective equipment to independent contractors risk violating contracting agreements. Manufacturers that step up to produce essential products and equipment to test, treat and protect against the virus face potential product liability claims.
   
 There is the thorny issue of medical liability for health care facilities and providers, and lesser-known regulatory requirements, such as limitations on customer communications.
   
 Make no mistake, employers have a strong responsibility to protect their workers and customers. But liability should be limited if they take reasonable precautions and are transparent about potential risks.

How do you make sure a Man Booker longlist nominee, winner of a Costa book award, that offers so much on paper, is translated to the screen without losing the essence that makes it a bestseller now and a probable future classic later? You hire the novelist to write the screenplay for you.
 Written for the screen by Sally Rooney, along with Alice Birch (Lady Macbeth) and playwright Mark O’Rowe, and directed in part by _The Room d_ irector Lenny Abrahamson, and in part by Hettie McDonald ( _Howard’s End_ ), the TV adaptation of _Normal Peopl_ e stays true to the work of the author while somehow managing to be fresh and exciting. The BBC Three production brings the heartache, the confusion, doubts and the intense passion from the book to the screen with adeptness, offering much relief to ardent book loyalists and TV enthusiasts alike.
  _Normal People_ is not a regular rom-com. The two protagonists are young school (and then university) students, but this is not a regular teenage love story. It is a searing heartbreaking story of attraction, intimacy, control, class, pride, peer pressure, mental health, and abuse built around the achingly real love story of Marianne Sheridan (Daisy-Edgar Jones) and Connell Waldron (Paul Mescal).
 Marianne is the school misfit, too smart, complex, and reasonably richer than the rest of the students in her school. Connell, who is popular at school, is the son of a working-class single mum who works as a cleaner at the Sheridan house. The two form a secret relationship, which they both believe to be strictly physical – but it is all too clear to readers, and now to viewers, that it is anything but that.
 The two meet again in University and now the tables are turned considerably – with Marianne finding her people, her tribe and her confidence, and Connell struggling to keep up in the big city. Through multiple cities, relationships and situations, the two are brought together and torn apart, losing themselves, failing at finding peace and true happiness away from each other.

Cowbrough, Abbigail Sub Lt. (N), age 23, of Dartmouth, died suddenly on April 29, 2020 in the Ionian Sea.A bright light continues to shine through the darkest parts of our own hearts. Abbigail had a crazy grin that could brighten any room. She was willful, smart, determined and kind. She leapt and danced her way into so many hearts. She sung, all be it horribly, with gusto and bravado. She tried new things all the time, especially food. She loved food. She didn't do anything small; she was all about hard work and determination.You never expect things to go wrong but when they do, they go horribly wrong. Abbigail is survived by such a long line of biological family and she has been adopted by so many around the world on her travels as a granddaughter, sister, mother, aunt. We all have loss. We are now eternally connected. All of us. I could go on with the clichés about being a good soldier, but she would feel never enough for those with whom she had the honour to serve. Glory other than to God is not what she would have in mind and I feel it may not be enough anyway.I brought her into this world; good, bad and the ugly. She lived hard. She read books, lots and lots of books, from Manga to Philosophy, and fun ones (she read everyone the Wonky Donkey with a Scottish accent). She flew kites and actual airplanes, skydived and traveled. She fed ducks and picked pussy willows in the spring. She could puddle jump like no one's business, even at 23. Abbigail believed in fairies. She was the girl who would trip a toddler if it meant she could see a Disney princess first. But she would sit, hold a baby in her arms and have freckle fights with random strangers. She snuck into every crevice of the darkest parts of people. She also snuck onto places top brass couldn't go just because she had the ability to manipulate anything into her command. I don't doubt she would have done great things, but she is expecting us all to stand up and get things done.Abbigail loved her civilian family as well as her Military one, her NATO, Pipes and Drums and Church families. These were her biggest teachers and supporters; they nurtured her and reared her. It is only right that she was blessed to die in their service. I swear I can hear the pipes and drums over the breeze with her belly laugh. She is looking over her shoulder with that signature coy Abbigail kiss.

The disease experts and the panic-pushing media initially scared the pants off California’s 40 million people with their predictions about the death toll of the coronavirus pandemic.
 They said 25 million people in the state would become infected by COVID-19 and a million of us would die from it.
 Predictably, the experts’ computer models were way off the mark, thank goodness.

Claudia Watkins (Kate Raison) has been secretly pulling the strings for some time and this week, she lays her plans for Aster on the table- she wants custody. Using the strained Kennedy marriage and an outburst from Susan (Jackie Woodburne) aimed at Mackenzie Hargreaves (Georgia Stone), she tells the stunned couple her plan and a hearing is set the very next day. Sam Fitzgerald (Simone Buchanan) makes herself known and the hostile meeting does not go in the Kennedy’s favour. Losing custody of Aster with immediate effect is another devastating blow and Susan struggles to process the news. But the person most devastated is of course Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) who feels isolated and unable to help from behind bars. What will Claudia do next as her plans continue?

WINTER HAVEN -- When you grow up competing with 11 siblings for the last piece of chicken or chocolate cake at the dinner table, competing against 11 ferocious defensive football players is probably all downhill.
   
 But you'd have to ask Mason Martin, Lakeland High School's rising-junior quarterback knows about both worlds from experience.
   
 "I think being in a family with 12 kids has made me a better athlete, and there is always something going on in the family. It is always chaotic and something new all the time," said Martin, 16, who sits atop the Dreadnaughts' depth chart at quarterback heading into the 2020 campaign.
   
 Since the spring football season was canceled and the official start date of the 2020 season hovers in limbo because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mason is working privately under the tutelage of former Lakeland quarterback Mike Peeples this spring.
   
 Mason is the second quarterback The Ledger is featuring in its spring series 2020 Eyes on the QBs.
   
 Peeples played at Lakeland from 1993-1995 before heading off to play quarterback at Tennessee Tech, which is Dreadnaughts head coach Bill Castle's alma mater. Peeples received his master's degree and then ventured into real estate.
   
 "Bill has always been a secondary father figure to me," Peeples said. "He called out of the blue and said we really can't have any contact with these kids. What are you doing? He asked if I wouldn't mind investing some time into Mason."
   
 Peeples coached quarterbacks at Lakeland from 2004-2007 when the Dreadnaughts won three consecutive state championships and a national championship and worked with quarterbacks Billy Lowe and Blair Castle. He also played arena football.
   
 "Bill wanted me to clean up some of Mason's footwork," Peeples said. "He is impressive but still has a long way to go. He has a cannon of an arm. I think he needs to dial that back a bit on his short game and find a little bit of touch on those short passes."
   
 Martin started and won the Dreadnaughts' first four games this past season after starter Chayil Garnett, now at Auburn, injured his thumb, had surgery, and was out until Game 5 of the regular season. Martin answered the call, almost flawlessly, winning against Bradenton Manatee, Clearwater American Collegiate Academy and George Jenkins by a combined score of 193-48.
   
 Martin finished the season appearing in seven games, and completing 21 of 35 passes for 320 yards with a team-leading six touchdowns and just three interceptions. He posted a quarterback rating of 94 and rushed for 75 yards.
   
 Peeples wants Martin to drop back a little bit deeper in the pocket while cleaning up some of his footwork.
   
 "He reminds me a lot of Billy Lowe, which goes back to the three-peat," Peeples said. "Lowe was left-handed and Mason is not, but they have a similar body build. Billy had a really strong arm and loved to tuck and run the ball, he wasn't afraid to run it. Mason strikes me as having a lot of similarities. He is a physical kid and you can tell his favorite plays are some of the run- pass options when he has the ball. He likes to tuck and run it."
   
 Martin, 16, is 6-feet tall and has been playing quarterback since he was 6. He holds a 4.2 weighted GPA and still works out six days a week, whether it is with a few teammates at a park, alone with weights, or with Peeples and his son at a park twice a week.
   
 He plays disc golf weekly at Carter Road Park. If football doesn't hold a career for him after college, he would like to be a doctor or aerospace engineer.
   
 "I think I am a pro-style quarterback right now," Martin said. "I am trying to get stronger and faster so we can open up coach Castle's playbook a little more. I know he likes that stuff. He likes a lot of RPOs and play-action. I just need to get stronger and faster.
   
 "Coach wants me at 185 and faster. Right now I am 180. Every day I am eating chicken and rice and bagels and a lot of cheeseburgers. I eat a lot of eggs and potatoes as well."
   
 Martin said he tends to throw the ball too hard in certain situations and he's focusing on releasing a more-catchable ball. His release point is usually around 10 or 11 o'clock, unless he is under pressure and then Mason said it goes up top to high noon.
   
 "Sometimes it was going through the receiver's hands," Martin said. "I guess I just threw it too hard on a slant or a hitch. One of the things is ball- placement, that is huge. Footwork and timing is everything on a pass. (Peeples) changed my form a little bit so that I am throwing at a higher- point. I think that has helped us some.
   
 "I feel like I have really good ball-placement and timing. I need to work on my form because when you get tired, your form slips up and you tend to throw a bad pass. I need to train my muscle memory to keep the good form always. Sometimes I tend to throw with my whole arm and don't use my legs."
   
 In the meantime, Martin is hoping COVID-19 disappears and football practice re-appears.
   
 "Hopefully, we can get back (to practicing) as a team in July. We have a lot of great players and it would be good to get the chemistry down," he said.

Recently, many politicians were in such a hurry to ban plastic bags.


   


  California and Hawaii banned them, then New York. Then Oregon, Connecticut, Maine and Vermont passed laws against them. More than 400 cities did, too.


   


  Why? Because plastic bags are evil, didn't you know?


   


  "Look at the damage done by plastic bags! It is everywhere!" complained New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.


   


  A Washington state senator cited "videos of animals choked by plastics, tangled in garbage!"


   


  So what should we use instead of plastic? Cloth bags! They're reusable! "Certainly the way to go!" said New Jersey's assembly speaker.


   


  But now, suddenly, politicians are canceling their bans. Instead, they're banning the once praised reusable bags.


   


  It's because of COVID-19, of course.


   


  Reusable bags already brought bacteria into stores. We're supposed to wash them, but almost no one does. Studies found reusable bags crawling with dangerous bacteria. After plastic bags were banned in San Francisco, food poisoning deaths increased sharply.


   


  But environmental groups, like Greenpeace, call those disease fears "misinformation."


   


  "There are no studies or evidence that reusable bags are transmitting viruses," says Alex Truelove of the Public Interest Research Group, in my new video.


   


  He's right. There are no human studies, but COVID-19 is so new. Millions of piglets died from swine coronavirus. The agriculture department concluded that reusable feed bags were probably the cause.


   


  Still, even now, some politicians can't wait to ban plastic again. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh says "as soon as this crisis is over we'll go back to all paper bags and reusable bags."


   


  "Politicians are always just looking for something to do," complains supermarket executive Andrea Catsimatidis.


   


  She points out that paper bags cost five times what plastic costs. "When you're talking billions of bags, it really adds up!"


   


  And paper bags don't hold as much. They rip.


   


  Plastic is more convenient. Why must politicians take away what's convenient?


   


  "Over two-thirds of everything we use is not recycled or composted and ends up in a landfill," complains Truelove.


   


  So what?


   


  People think America is running out of room for landfills, but that's not true.


   


  "All America's trash for the next century would fit in one landfill just 18 miles square," says environmental economist Ross McKitrick. Landfills take up so little space that "if you look the air you wouldn't even be able to see where landfills are."


   


  And modern landfills hardly pollute. They're surrounded by layers of clay and plastic that keep nasty stuff in the garbage from leaking out.


   


  But what about all that plastic in the ocean?


   


  Plastic bags are sometimes eaten by animals. Some sea turtles mistake the bags for jellyfish and then starve. Islands of floating garbage have formed in the Pacific Ocean.


   


  Green groups have convinced Americans that we are to blame.


   


  But we aren't! Even if you litter -- and today, fewer Americans do -- your litter is unlikely to end up in an ocean.


   


  Almost all the plastic in oceans comes from Asia and Africa. Less than 1% comes from North America.


   


  In other words, banning plastic bags in America will accomplish roughly ... nothing.


   


  What it will do is inconvenience Americans and make some of us sick.


   


  Truelove says, "We should ... set an example for the rest of the world."


   


  "That's posturing," replies McKitrick. "The rest of the world isn't looking to see what you do with your Starbucks cup.


   


  "If we are concerned about other countries' waste going into their river systems," he adds, "there are better things we can do. We can share technology with them so they process their waste better. That's better than imposing on consumers' tiresome inconveniences in hopes that it will somehow change behavior on the other side of the planet."


   


  Politicians "looking for something to do" routinely do more harm than good.

It’s simultaneously laughable and pathetic. This is what Christians get when they hire pastors based on compassion and not fire. The lawsuits may make the deacons who are also lawyers happy but it undermines the status of the church.
 Lawsuits are defensive, deferential and submissive. Even when the church wins the suit – after months of empty pews – the victory still allows government to set the conditions for worship.
 Christ is either King or He’s just another activist with an opinion.
 Worship does set an example. Not worshiping shows the world church is secondary to secular control. Continuing to worship shows Christ is still in control of the believer’s world.
 Some pastors know this.
 In Chicago, Metro Praise International knows the stakes and has been demonstrating “passive resistance” to the state. The pastor doesn’t plan to sue, he plans to preach. GraceBuilt Church in Waynesboro, Va. defied Gov. Blackface Northam before he lifted restrictions on church services.
 And Louisiana pastor Tony Spell preached last week with an ankle monitor on as he defied a judge’s order to stay home and stay silent.
 That is what should be done all along. Worship first then, if necessary, the courts to get the pastor and the parishioners out of jail.
 Hold services with social distancing, sanitizer in the baptismal and individual Communion packets. Urge seniors and the vulnerable to stay home. Hold plenty of services each Sunday so everyone who wants to attend can social distance their way inside. For those that can’t, the staff can visit them personally and pray through the storm door during the week.
 The important point is to demonstrate you believe Christ is important enough to worship regardless of Caesar.
 Sure, some churches will flaunt the WuFlu rules – we’ll call them snake–handlers – but those congregations were probably dangerous before the epidemic.
 Anything is better than what Believers have now. The Great Pandemic Panic is the biggest victory for the secular, Christianity-hostile left in decades. A victory facilitated by docile, fearful, spiritually-lacking pastors who sat passively while the powers and principalities that rule this earth convinced Christians that God and worship were non-essential.

Fauci is talking of the real possibility of a second and even more severe wave of the pandemic this summer and fall, if we open too soon.
 There is evidence to justify the fears of Fauci and Dr. Robert Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control, who told the same Senate committee, “We are not out of the woods yet.”
 Yet, there is a case to be made for the risks that Trump and red state governors are taking in opening up sooner.
 The Washington Post daily graph of new deaths nationally has been showing a curve sloping downward for a month from April’s more than 2,000 a day. On no day yet this week did the U.S. record 2,000 dead from the virus. On some days, there were fewer than 1,000.
 The graph for new coronavirus cases, which was showing more than 30,000 a day in April, is now closer to 25,000.
 Also, hospitalizations and ICU occupancies are not as high as they were. Hospitals put up in Central Park and the Javits Center seem not to have been needed. There was and is no shortage of ventilators. The Navy hospital ships Comfort and Mercy are returning to their home ports.
 Also, not all states are suffering equally, nor are all communities in the hardest-hit states. There have been three times as many COVID-19 cases in New Jersey as in Texas, though New Jersey is a fraction of the size and has a fraction of the population of Texas.
 There are twice as many cases in Massachusetts as in Florida, the nation’s third-most populous state with one of its highest percentages of retirees and elderly. There have been five times as many cases in New York as in California.
 It is the nursing homes filled with the elderly and ill that have proven to be the real killing fields of this virus. According to The New York Times, one- third of all deaths from COVID-19 have come among residents and staff of nursing homes. Beyond these are the meatpacking plants and the prisons where social distancing is almost nonexistent.

Hindustan Times via Getty Images Stranded migrant workers head to a temporary shelter home inside Tau Devi Lal Stadium after Gurugram Police dispersed their gathering on the road amid lockdown, on May 15, 2020 in Gurugram
 At least 24 migrant laborers lost their lives and 36 people sustained injuries when a trailer truck carrying them collided with another truck in the early hours of Saturday in Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh, police said.
 Both the trucks were carrying the laborers. The incident took place between 3 am and 3.30 am, they said.
 "The accident took place in Mihauli in which 24 people died, and around 36 were injured. A trailer truck carrying around 50 migrant labourers was coming from Rajasthan and it collided with another truck.
 The accident took place on Saturday between 3.00 am and 3.30 am," Circle Officer, Auraiya, Surendranath Yadav told PTI.
 Auraiya, which falls under the Kanpur division, is in south-west Uttar Pradesh. It is on the National Highway-19 and is 400 km away from Delhi and 200 km from Lucknow.
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the deceased.
 Elaborating on the incident, Yadav said, "The trailer truck hit the other vehicle, which was coming from Delhi and heading towards Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh. Both the vehicles turned upside down after losing control."
 The chief minister, in a statement released by the state government, directed the divisional commissioner and IG Kanpur to visit the site and give a report on the cause of the accident immediately.

ONE of the three MDC Alliance officials, Cecilia Chimbiri, who was allegedly abducted on Wednesday, yesterday recounted the horrific sexual and physical abuse they endured at the hands of the kidnappers.      Chimbiri was one of the three opposition official who went missing on Wednesday after staging a flash protest in Warren Park high-density suburb, along side Harare West MP Joanah Mamombe and Netsai Marova.      Badly assaulted, the three were later found at Muchapondwa Business Centre in Bindura South on Thursday night.      They were taken to a private Harare clinic, where they narrated their ordeal to leader Nelson Chamisa and several other party officials.      Chimbiri said the abductors took turns to suck her breasts while shoving the barrel of a gun up her anal passage.      "They were taking turns to suck my boobs. They forced a gun into my anal passage. They forced us to drink urine. They beat us under our feet, (and on) my back. They were also beating us with bare hands," said a visibly shaken Chimbiri.      "But most of all, they violated me. They sexually assaulted me. They asked me if I had labia minora, and I thought they wanted to rape me. They went on to force the barrel of their gun and a stick up my anal passage."      She said they were forced to sing non-stop and beaten every time they stopped, and they nicknamed her "Dolly Parton".      The other two officials, Mamombe and Marova, were sleeping when Chamisa visited them yesterday afternoon.      According to Chamisa, the three abductees said when they were arrested on Wednesday, they were taken to Harare Central Police Station, but later picked up by other security details on the pretext that they wanted to take them to the scene of crime in Warren Park.      They were shoved into a black Toyota Wish, then blindfolded and driven away, tortured and later dumped in Bindura.      But police yesterday insisted it was carrying investigations on what happened, denying it ever arrested the three, despite on Wednesday telling State media that they had arrested some of the protestors.      "We are appealing to members of the public with information surrounding the matter to come forward and contact any nearest police station to assist the police with investigations," police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said in a statement yesterday.      Information permanent secretary Ndabaningi Mangawana also issued a statement yesterday, claiming government was not aware of what happened to the three opposition officials.      "The three women were part of the group of MDC youths that defied the lockdown laws in the country and took part in an illegal demonstration in Warren Park," Mangwana said in the statement.      "Police then sought to interview them on suspicion of committing crimes related to the lockdown and holding of illegal demonstrations. While the police were looking for them, social media chatter indicating that the three had disappeared was observed."      But Chamisa yesterday accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa of fronting the abduction and torture of the three party members in an effort to sustain his stay in power.      The opposition leader said the abduction carried Mnangagwa's signature.      "Across the year of 2019, we recorded a total of 49 abductions, yet they lie to the world that this is self-inflicted, it's false abductions, when it's clear that the same pattern is being used and their intentions are known. It's all meant to preserve an illegitimate regime, all meant to try and defend an unelected regime, all meant to defend Mr Mnangagwa," Chamisa charged.      He alleged that all the abductions and torture were being done at the behest of Mnangagwa.      "Those people doing it are doing it on behalf of Mr Mnangagwa. What makes it so obvious is that Mr Mnangagwa has never condemned this and not even a single arrest has been done of all these cases and one wonders why," Chamisa said.      The opposition leader immediately called for the intervention of Sadc and the international community to rescue Zimbabwe.      "Zimbabwe has become a hotspot of human rights abuses and crimes against humanity ... We appeal to Sadc and the international community saying we have a serious political crisis in Zimbabwe, the human rights abuses are of international proportions," Chamisa said.      After being located, pictures of the three activists, who were initially reported to have been arrested by police, showed they were visibly shaken.      Chamisa said they had been degraded, violated and beaten by their abductors.      "They are shaken. Even if you just open the door they will be shaken fearful. What kind of a person would suck the breast of a young woman just because she has demonstrated? These are not humans, they are beasts," he said.      The MDC Alliance leader said the time for talks with Mnangagwa had lapsed, with only international intervention being the only option.      "We have said we want talks with Mr Mnangagwa, but how do you talk to a hyena that wants blood," he said.      Chamisa said time was ripe for citizens to draw a line in the sand and confront tyranny head on.      "It takes a good man to do nothing for evil to persist. This evil is persisting because we have not come together as Zimbabweans to say enough is enough, it's time for us to draw a line in the sand," Chamisa said.      Families of the abducted were visibly shaken after seeing their loved ones in a sorry state, with some failing to hold back their tears.

 When he finally arrived at Grain Valley High School, he met his "second dad," in defensive coordinator Pete Carpino, who told the youngster, "One day you are going to be a great leader and a great husband and a great father."
   
 Those words are as fresh in Blackmon's mind today as they were four years ago in the Eagles' weight room.
   
 "I was holding the door for some students going in and out of the weight room," Blackmon said, "And Coach came over and told me that I was going to be a great leader and husband and father. No one had ever really said anything like that to me before. I hope he knows how important he is in my life.
   
 "I don't know where I'd be without my grandparents and Coach Carpino and the Eagles football family."
   
 Did you notice that Blackmon did not call the Eagles a team, he called them his family?
   
 "We never have called each other teammates, we have always called each other family," Blackmon said. "And what is so cool is that my grandparents are part of our family. The guys love them as much as I do."
   
 For more than a decade, the Spurgeons would pay for camps, take young Steele to practices and Saturday morning little league games.
   
 "And they did it because they love me and they loved watching play or practice or anything," he said, laughing. "I can't tell you how many practices they came to when it was 100 degrees, or the times my grandma and grandpa would sit in their car if it was raining.
   
 "If I was practicing or playing, they were there."
   
 And Carpino is so thrilled that the Spurgeons played such a big role in their grandson's life.
   
 "Steele might be the most popular kid in our school," Carpino said. "The girls love him because he's just a big teddy bear and the guys admire him for what he's done in football and the classroom.
   
 "I remember back when I saw this freshman holding the door for students in the weight room and it really impressed me. I didn't really know Steele back then, but he has become a very special person in my life and a great player on our team.
   
 "For him to call me a second dad is about the best compliment I've ever received."
   
 Blackmon received a great compliment a week ago when he was told he had earned a spot on the Missouri squad for the Greater Kansas City Football Coaches Association's Missouri vs. Kansas All-Star Game.
   
 Unfortunately the game scheduled for June 11 at North Kansas City High School has been canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "I would have loved to have played in that game," Blackmon said, "but I have so many things to be thankful for. I'm disappointed, but I am truly blessed."
   
 Now he's going to give it a go in college.
   
 "I have received preferred walk-on status at Northwest Missouri State University and that is my dream school," Blackmon said of the NCAA Division II power and six-time national champion. "When I visited the campus, I felt like I was home, I felt like I was with my new family.
   
 "And I am going to work so hard to make that team and prove to the coaches and players that I can play at the next level. I love a challenge, and that will be one of the biggest I have ever faced - and I can't wait."

In years that followed, Geneva remained a major hub for Swissair long-haul flights. But in 1996 most of these were switched to Kloten, despite fierce protests from political and business leaders in western Switzerland.
 It was not until the Swissair grounding in 2001 that Geneva Airport switched direction to refocus its strategy on the low-cost airline Easyjet, which now accounts for 45% of traffic, versus 15% for Swissair’s replacement Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS). Geneva Airport also worked to rebuild its network of long-haul connections with other airlines.
 Over the past decade, Geneva’s modified strategy has borne fruit. Air traffic has doubled, terminals have been extended and facilities have been modernised. Geneva has strengthened its position as Switzerland’s second busiest airport with 57 airlines serving 149 destinations.
 Traffic was expected to continue to rise, however, coronavirus external linkhas thrown a spanner in the works.

Cowbrough, Abbigail Sub Lt. (N), age 23, of Dartmouth, died suddenly on April 29, 2020 in the Ionian Sea.      A bright light continues to shine through the darkest parts of our own hearts. Abbigail had a crazy grin that could brighten any room. She was willful, smart, determined and kind. She leapt and danced her way into so many hearts. She sung, all be it horribly, with gusto and bravado. She tried new things all the time, especially food. She loved food. She didn't do anything small; she was all about hard work and determination.      You never expect things to go wrong but when they do, they go horribly wrong. Abbigail is survived by such a long line of biological family and she has been adopted by so many around the world on her travels as a granddaughter, sister, mother, aunt. We all have loss. We are now eternally connected. All of us. I could go on with the clichés about being a good soldier, but she would feel never enough for those with whom she had the honour to serve. Glory other than to God is not what she would have in mind and I feel it may not be enough anyway.      I brought her into this world; good, bad and the ugly. She lived hard. She read books, lots and lots of books, from Manga to Philosophy, and fun ones (she read everyone the Wonky Donkey with a Scottish accent). She flew kites and actual airplanes, skydived and traveled. She fed ducks and picked pussy willows in the spring. She could puddle jump like no one's business, even at 23. Abbigail believed in fairies. She was the girl who would trip a toddler if it meant she could see a Disney princess first. But she would sit, hold a baby in her arms and have freckle fights with random strangers. She snuck into every crevice of the darkest parts of people. She also snuck onto places top brass couldn't go just because she had the ability to manipulate anything into her command. I don't doubt she would have done great things, but she is expecting us all to stand up and get things done.      Abbigail loved her civilian family as well as her Military one, her NATO, Pipes and Drums and Church families. These were her biggest teachers and supporters; they nurtured her and reared her. It is only right that she was blessed to die in their service. I swear I can hear the pipes and drums over the breeze with her belly laugh. She is looking over her shoulder with that signature coy Abbigail kiss. I catch it like that moment between heart beats; that quiet fluttering. It has been said we only have but one death to spend, and who would not want to pass with brothers in arms. She did not die for her God, family, country or Navy; she lived for these things.      Cremation has taken place. Burial at sea ceremony will be held on the Battle of the Atlantic Sunday, 2021, from the HMCS Fredericton.      In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to UN-NATO Veterans Nova Scotia Chapter.      Online condolences may be made by visiting www.atlanticfuneralhomes.com, Dartmouth Chapel

Of the 33 states that have had a 14-day downward trajectory of either cases or positive test rates, 25 are partially opened or moving to reopen within days, the AP analysis found. Other states that have not seen a 14-day decline, remain closed despite meeting some benchmarks.
 Besides Fauci, of the National Institutes of Health, the other experts include FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — both in self-quarantine—and Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus “testing czar” at the Department of Health and Human Services.
 The event Tuesday got underway in the committee’s storied hearing room, but that’s about all that remained of the pre-pandemic way of conducting oversight. The senators running the event, Alexander and Democrat Patty Murray of Washington, were heads on video screens, with an array of personal items in the background as they isolated back home.
 A few senators, such as Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, personally attended the session in the hearing room. They wore masks, as did an array of aides buzzing behind them.
 The health committee hearing offers a very different setting from the White House coronavirus task force briefings the administration witnesses have all participated in. Most significantly, Trump will not be controlling the agenda.
 Eyeing the November elections, Trump has been eager to restart the economy, urging on protesters who oppose their state governors’ stay-at-home orders and expressing his own confidence that the coronavrius will fade away as summer advances and Americans return to work and other pursuits.
 The U.S. has seen at least 1.3 million infections and nearly 81,000 confirmed deaths from the virus, the highest toll in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 Separately, one expert from the World Health Organization has already warned that some countries are “driving blind” into reopening their economies without having strong systems to track new outbreaks. And three countries that do have robust tracing systems — South Korea, Germany and China — have already seen new outbreaks after lockdown rules were relaxed.
 WHO’s emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, said Germany and South Korea have good contact tracing that hopefully can detect and stop virus clusters before they get out of control. But he said other nations — which he did not name — have not effectively employed investigators to contact people who test positive, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine before they can spread the virus.
 “Shutting your eyes and trying to drive through this blind is about as silly an equation as I’ve seen,” Ryan said. “Certain countries are setting themselves up for some seriously blind driving over the next few months.”
 Apple, Google, some U.S. states and European countries are developing contact- tracing apps that show whether someone has crossed paths with an infected person. But experts say the technology only supplements and does not replace labor-intensive human work.
 U.S. contact tracing remains a patchwork of approaches and readiness levels. States are hiring contact tracers but experts say tens of thousands will be needed across the country.
 Worldwide, the virus has infected nearly 4.2 million people and killed over 286,000, including more than 150,000 in Europe, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. Experts believe those numbers are too low for a variety of reasons.

Second-placed Dortmund will welcome bitter rivals and sixth-placed Schalke to Signal Iduna Park behind closed doors in the league's first game since the 2019-20 season was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 crisis.


  "That is the game for Dortmund and Schalke fans. That's bigger than Dortmund and Bayern, that's bigger than anything," former Dortmund goalkeeper Mitch Langerak, who won two Bundesliga titles under Jurgen Klopp during his five years at the club, told Stats Perform.


  "I remember some fans saying, 'we don't care if we come last in the Bundesliga, as long as we beat Schalke.' That's the biggest thing.


  "You see the build-up, you hear stories about what's happened in the years gone past. That is a massive, massive fixture to kick things off.


  "It will probably have the highest viewing on TV of all-time because you have 80,000 people who would normally cram into the stadium, they can't go. It's going to be a massive game and I can't wait."


  The Revierderby will take centre stage domestically and abroad, as it so often does. Schalke and Dortmund played out a goalless draw in October, but the iconic match carries extra weight this time around following the coronavirus outbreak.


  While Ligue 1 and Eredivisie have decided to cancel their seasons, the Bundesliga is returning as the Premier League, Serie A and LaLiga try to restart.


  But the 156th Revierderby will stand alone compared to previous instalments, with no fans permitted inside Westfalenstadion this weekend.


  "The players on both sides are well aware of what that game means to everybody," Australia international Langerak, who now plays for J1League side Nagoya Grampus, said. "It's not just another game in Germany. The players will understand but without fans, it will be a completely different feeling.


  "You wouldn't say there would be less fire within the game, it might be a little bit more tactical or players might be a little calmer in certain situations.


  "For example, if someone is chasing the game with 10 minutes to go and the fans are getting their tails up, that is when anything can happen. That is going to be missing, however, the players will understand these are crazy times and will adapt as best they can."


  Langerak experienced his fair share of Revierderby clashes after he was plucked from Australian club Melbourne Victory in 2010 and thrust into Dortmund's first team.


  The 31-year-old was involved in 11 showdowns against Schalke before leaving Dortmund in 2015 – Shinji Kagawa's brace in a 3-1 victory away to Die Konigsblauen in 2010 a standout moment.


  "I wasn't lucky enough to play in one of those games but the first one was in Schalke and I think Kagawa scored two goals," Langerak – a DFB-Pokal and two- time DFL-Supercup winner with Dortmund to go with his 2012-13 Champions League runner-up medal – added. "Huge game. I remember we came back on the bus from Schalke to Dortmund. By the time we got back to Dortmund, the training ground where we get into our cars, there were that many fans – there was flares, it was the biggest party.


  "We were obviously stuck on the bus for 30 minutes or something while the fans were celebrating for us. Then you get off the bus and you couldn't just get in your car and drive because they were blocking our cars in. They were just dancing around our cars, there were flares and singing. In this moment, everyone who is associated with Dortmund is a hero for the next week."

The Browns plan to plug Jedrick Wills into a position he's never previously played and start the 10th overall draft pick right away despite their coaching staff's inability to guide him in person thus far because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 That's how much faith they have in the rookie offensive lineman's ability to transition to left tackle after he played right tackle for the University of Alabama and Lafayette High School in Lexington, Kentucky.
   
 "I think whenever you draft a player as high as we've drafted Jedrick, I've always felt that you've got to plug him in and play him immediately. I mean, that's why you draft him," new Browns offensive line coach Bill Callahan said Thursday during a Zoom video conference with beat writers who cover the team. "So, no, that doesn't concern me, scare me, bother me in any respect. So I'm quite confident that he's capable of being our left tackle.
   
 "[Young players are] going to go through some lumps, and they're going to have some times where they're going to get beat, but the best in the game get beat. I think what we're trying to do is establish kind of a mode of consistency with him, so that he can get confidence in his techniques and be that consistent player for us, and then I really put a lot of stock in the rate of improvement over the long haul of the season."
   
 During the April 23-25 draft, General Manager Andrew Berry, Chief Strategy Officer Paul DePodesta and new Browns coach Kevin Stefanski cited Callahan's belief in Wills and experience helping Dallas Cowboys seven-time Pro Bowler Tyron Smith become a dominant left tackle in the NFL after he played on the right side in college as reasons for selecting Wills. DePodesta said the Browns had ranked Wills No. 1 among all of the offensive tackles in the 2020 draft class.
   
 "You can feel him on film. He came alive on tape," Callahan said of Wills, who protected the blindside of left-handed quarterback Tua Tagovailoa at Alabama. "You got excited about what he was doing throughout the course of the game.
   
 ''A lot of times people talk about makeup and they talk about character and all these other things, which are great, which he does have, but he's got these intangibles that show up in tangible ways on film where you watch him finish, you watch him detail a technique, you watch his consistent effort and his stamina throughout the course of the game from start to finish. I think that was the appeal for me."
   
 Callahan added everyone spoke highly of Wills when Browns scouts dug into his background.
   
 "So when you put all those pieces together," Callahan said, "it's not a hard decision to make."
   
 The head coach of the Oakland Raiders from 2002-03, Callahan said Wills evokes memories of Barry Sims because of his athletic movement. Sims moved around on the line after playing in Europe and became a longtime starting left tackle for the Raiders. Callahan said he convinced Raiders coach Jon Gruden to resist his urge to cut Sims, who signed as an undrafted rookie free agent in 1999, and the patience eventually paid off.
   
 "I really thought that Jedrick reminded me of Barry and he could make that switch easily because of his athleticism," Callahan said.
   
 In his 44 seasons of coaching, Callahan has overseen many position changes on the line. He explained a player's "willingness" is the No. 1 key to a successful transition.
   
 Smith has made the past seven Pro Bowls. Callahan served as his position coach from 2012-14.
   
 "Tyron was really wide open to [changing positions], and nothing fazes him because he's such a competitor," Callahan said. "So when we made the switch, it was seamless for him. He had a few bumps in the road like they're all gonna have. But he was quite confident.
   
 "From a muscle memory standpoint, you've got to get a groove. And a lot of that really depends on the training and the reps and all that, but when you're grooving a player, they need constant, consistent reps day in, day out to get their game up to the level that you want it."
   
 That's challenging during this unprecedented time.
   
 Wills, who will turn 21 on Sunday, hasn't been able to receive hands-on instruction from Callahan because NFL facilities are shut down due to COVID-19 concerns. Wills has been participating in the Browns' virtual offseason program, which included a rookie minicamp that ran last weekend.
   
 Callahan said Wills has been practicing basic techniques, including a left- handed stance, and sending the veteran coach videos of the workouts. They also have watched film of other tackles with whom Callahan has worked.
   
 "He's a sponge for information," Callahan said. "He's absorbed all the content that you can give him, and he wants more. So I'm really excited about him, and I'm eager at some point to get on the field with him."

Newly installed JEA board members took a fresh look Friday at plans for a new headquarters building in downtown Jacksonville and favored following through with a building that's seven stories tall rather than nine floors.
   
 While that change would give less office space at the headquarters building, JEA would make up the difference by constructing a separate 40,000 square building that would be super-hardened against storms for the utility's emergency operations center and other critical functions.
   
 "I think it gives us something to move forward with this project," JEA board member Bobby Stein said Friday during a board workshop devoted to the headquarters building.
   
 He said compared to sticking with the plan approved in January for a nine- story headquarters, JEA would save several million dollars overall by shrinking the size of the headquarters and constructing the smaller second building.
   
 The JEA board will need to authorize the change, possibly at a meeting that would be scheduled next week.
   
 JEA selected the Ryan Companies in April 2019 to construct a new building that JEA will lease as its headquarters on a site near the Duval County Courthouse.
   
 When the former JEA board decided in July 2019 to put the utility up for sale, JEA said it might have to move out of downtown to lease space in the suburbs if JEA remained a city-owned utility.
   
 The JEA board later decided in the midst of the now-cancelled sales process to give Ryan Companies a green light to keep moving ahead with design and other plans for the new headquarters.
   
 Ryan Companies had hoped to start construction earlier this year, but JEA has continued to examine modifications to the size of the headquarters. Ryan Companies has bank financing lined up but that commitment only runs through June 15.
   
 The latest review sought to take into account financial costs and the changing office culture wrought by the response to the coronavirus pandemic that has required social distancing at offices and more people working remotely from home.
   
 JEA board members showed no interest in shelving the plan for a new headquarters.
   
 JEA currently owns two office towers in downtown that have 360,000 square feet of space for 960 employees who work there, which JEA says its far too much space for that workforce.
   
 Stein said those buildings are a "ticking time bomb" because of all the maintenance needed for them.
   
 "I think these buildings need to be demolished," Stein said.
   
 A plan approved by JEA in January for the new headquarters building envisioned a nine-story structure with 196,900 square feet of space and an 841-space parking garage.
   
 During the workshop Friday, board members coalesced around a plan for a 152,000-square-foot building with a 742-space parking garage. The garage would have space for use by the nearby State Attorney's Office, though board members wanted more information about whether JEA would get a return on that expense from leasing revenue.
   
 "We're not in the parking business," board Chairman John Baker said.
   
 JEA would build and own a new 40,000-square-foot building at a site yet to be determined.

As NASCAR returns to the track in Charlotte, N.C. for the XFINITY Series ALSCO 300, SANY America and its dealer partner, Ironpeddlers, are proud to announce they have signed on as co-sponsors of driver Colby Howard and car #15 as part of the J.D. Motorsports team. NASCAR kicks off its revised 2020 racing schedule Monday, May 25 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, and, like so many Americans, the team at SANY is looking forward to seeing live racing return to the lineup. “We are excited to be working with Colby and the J.D. Motorsports team to help them drive to success,” said Ben Miller, Vice President of Sales – Construction for SANY America. “As we grow, it’s important for us to align with the values of the customers we serve, and our partnership with Colby and NASCAR is the perfect opportunity to celebrate our growth in America and our commitment to our U.S. partners and customers.” It is SANY’s close relationship and commitment to its dealer partners like Ironpeddlers that brought about this sponsorship opportunity. Anthony Broome, President and Co-Owner of Ironpeddlers, has personally known Howard’s father for more than two decades, which allowed him to connect with the J.D. Motorsports team and present this chance for the organizations to work together. “The national coverage will also be good for all SANY dealers across the U.S.,” said Broome. “NASCAR is a favored sport among many equipment operators and owners, and we look forward to leveraging that relationship to drive awareness.” SANY has had its foot on the gas pedal in the American heavy equipment market in recent years, picking up speed and growing availability across the United States, including a substantial increase in equipment lines. In just the past year, SANY has introduced additional wheel loader and excavator models, as well as new telehandlers and road equipment, including a motor grader and roller. The company has also increased production capabilities at its Georgia headquarters, adding more than 50,000 square feet of space to the manufacturing floor to help keep up with surging demand for machines. “NASCAR is a staple in nearly every American household,” said Miller. “SANY has the same goal – to become a staple for the contractors, operators and users of our equipment nationwide.” Howard is also looking forward to the partnership, and will visit Ironpeddlers headquarters in Monroe, N.C. ahead of the race to get a first-hand look at some SANY equipment and meet with representatives from the dealership and SANY. “I am very excited to welcome SANY America on board starting at Charlotte,” said Howard. “SANY has a proven track record in the construction industry, and to have support from them is a great feeling. I look forward to representing them in the best way possible as we develop our new relationship and can’t wait to get back to the track!” As SANY continues to increase its footprint across the country, the company continues to look for new partnerships like Ironpeddlers to continue supporting construction crews, fleet operators and all those working every day across the country.

In fact he had regularly put his hand in his pocket to try to keep the club afloat. As a result he was one of its major creditors, being owed almost £600,000.
 In addition Boro had taken out a loan of £200,000 which a securities company which was backed by Duffield’s company.
 The overall estimate of the debt was around £1.8m, with just over £600,000 owed to the Midland Bank, £120,000 to former chairman Charles Amer and £100,000 to Cleveland County Council.
 The situation had spiralled out of control. The debts were increasing month by month and there was no promise of better times to come at the end of the day.
 The general quality of football served up by the Boro had been pretty poor for some time.
 To make matters worse, the club had been relegated to Division Three for only the second time in its history.
 The fans had deserted the club in droves, leaving gate income at rock bottom.
 There was no prospect that Boro would ever manage to pay its way in the future unless it could rid itself of this huge weight around its neck.
 So it seemed a logical step to enter into liquidation, bring an end of the old club and its problems, and start a completely new club in its place.
 It would have worked too, if Boro had been allowed to do things their way.
 Unfortunately times were changing. The Bristol City phoenix had ruffled quite a few feathers, particularly at the headquarters of the Football League.
 Bristol City’s new owners had attracted a lot of negative publicity for not paying off the creditors of the old club.
 This heavy criticism rebounded badly on the respectability of the League and football in general.
 So Boro were informed in no uncertain terms by the League that if they wanted to come back as a League club, then the existing creditors must be paid in full.
 This was a slap in the face for the Boro, who had gone into liquidation only because they couldn’t pay back the £1.8m in the first place.
 The news sent shockwaves throughout Teesside. There was genuine concern that Boro were dead and buried.
 The ruling placed immense pressure on the shoulders of Steve Gibson, who had stepped up to be chairman of the club following Duffield’s resignation.

"May I kindly request that we have plan B for quarantine centres in case schools and colleges open," the communiqué read.      "You can look at such places as community halls, churches if the owners are agreeable and warehouses. We also need a warehouse in each district where food stuff will be stocked."      A source privy to the goings-on said government was running short of alternative quarantine centres with the imminent opening of schools.      "There is an urgent need to look for alternative infrastructure to quarantine repatriates as schools might open soon and we will be left with nowhere to quarantine them since all the facilities but one, a hotel, are learning facilities. Probably, this is what the newlyappointed national COVID-19 coordinator in the President's Office, Agnes Mahomva, saw as a grey area in the fight to control the spread of COVID-19," he said.      The source added that government was looking at churches, community halls and warehouses.      "Even those who can donate their properties for use to quarantine the repatriates are welcome to help as it is a national disaster. It needs us to fight together. The government is in a quandary as this would also likely affect the opening of schools if the numbers of returnees surge as anticipated due to lack of space to accommodate them."      Some returnees are being accommodated at Belvedere Technical Teachers College and Zipam in Mt Hampden, while those coming from neighbouring countries are being quarantined in learning facilities in the hosting towns of their entry points.      Thousands of Zimbabweans working in South Africa and Botswana are returning home after finding the going tough in the neighbouring countries due to the lockdown measures.

Eighteen buses carrying 576 Zimbabweans deported from South Africa, with 129 being ex-prisoners, went through Beitbridge border post last week.

“These elections will not bring hope for us because we have lost so much," said Solange Teta, a refugee in Rwanda. “The ruling party candidate cannot alleviate our suffering."
 Sporadic violence persists. Police said two people were killed and eight wounded in a grenade attack Sunday on a bar in Bujumbura that's a popular hangout for ruling party supporters. Opposition supporters worry the security services may retaliate.
 Charles Nditije, a former government minister who lives in exile, described the election as a “joke,” calling the polls a formality aimed at installing Nkurunziza's chosen successor.
 “What Burundians want now is anything that can bring to (an) end the reign of CNDD-FDD. But the ruling (party) candidate will fight tooth and nail to win fraudulently and set another round of crisis,” he said.
 Hartill, the Burundi researcher, said disputed election results could put the country back on edge. The big question, he said, is whether the opposition leader will “say enough is enough.”

The tenacious bear visited them a couple nights in a row but Gary said he hasn't shown up again since he removed the bird feeder.


  DNR Wildlife Biologist Vern Richardson said bird seed is packed with calories, which bears can smell from miles away.


  "Bears can smell from farther away than we can see," Richardson said. "And they're always hungry ... always looking for food."


  Richardson said for the most part, all hibernating bears are awake right now and looking to pack on the pounds in preparation for next winter.


  This time of year, there isn't a lot available for bears to eat other than vegetation, which doesn't provide much in the way of calories. As a result, bird feeders are an irresistible attraction.


  "They're calories condensed to a solid block," Richardson said. "Most phone calls we get in the spring and early summer involve a bear getting into someone's bird feeder."


  Even after a bird feeder is removed, Richardson said a bear can smell the seed for hours and days afterward; and once a bear comes to associate a location with food, they'll check back periodically to see if the food source returns, sometimes for years at a time.


  "They have an incredible memory," Richardson said. "Like a person trying out a new restaurant, they remember if they have a good or bad experience. They'll check it less and less frequently if there is no food there each time they come back."


  Richardson said anyone who lives outside a city's downtown area runs the risk of attracting bears if they put out a bird feeder. The best thing they can do is wait until fall to put out feeders or at least wait as long as possible into the summer, when other food sources for bears start to become available.


  They can also try filling bird feeders with thistle seed, which is smaller and less calorie-dense than other types of bird feed, making it less appealing to bears.


  Although many people have been less active during the day as a result of the Stay Home, Stay Safe order, Richardson said he doesn't think this has made bears more brazen or likely to encroach on areas where humans are living. He said they are typically most active at night, when people are less active anyway.


  Although bears usually aren't aggressive around humans, he's heard about situations involving dogs that were let out at night to use the bathroom, only to surprise a bear in the backyard and get into a fight. To avoid this scenario, Richardson suggests turning on the house lights and peering outside for a few minutes before letting the dogs out. This may give the bear enough time to gather its cubs, if necessary, and leave the area.
