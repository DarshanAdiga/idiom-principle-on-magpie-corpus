UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations held an unusual session Wednesday (Jul 15) to express fears of "catastrophe" if a decaying oil tanker abandoned off Yemen's coast with 1.1 million barrels of crude on board ruptures into the Red Sea.
 A breach of the 45-year-old FSO Safer, anchored off the port of Hodeida, would have disastrous results for marine life and tens of thousands of impoverished people who depend on fishing for their livelihood.

“I was really nervous and fearful as the virus began to ramp up,” Solecki recalled. “The experience made me humble to the vulnerabilities of our bodies, and I had to take care in traveling between my mom’s and my dad’s because I had many high-risk family members.”
 While COVID-19 forced the entire county to adapt with virtual learning, Solecki was ahead of the curve already when it came to online education.
 Solecki participated in the HHS dual enrollment program with Eastern West Virginia Community and Technical College, so when she completed her senior year she also ended with an associate’s degree. She even ended up being involved in Eastern’s honor society, Phi Theta Kappa.
 The other positive to being dual-enrolled was that she was familiar with an online learning platform.

The transition wasn’t difficult for me,” Solecki said. “But unfortunately I was not able to attend Hampshire in person my last 2 years of high school, but I did try to remain involved in the actions of my senior class.”
 She cited her family as her main support system, saying that they have always supported her life choices and academic decisions.
 “There have been many bumps in the road on the way to success, and my family has always been there to help me navigate the difficult terrain of growing up,” she said, also adding that her “tight network” of close friends helped her get through her high school career.
 Solecki, who lives in Capon Bridge, worked as a dietary aide at a retirement and healthcare facility in Winchester while she completed her years at HHS, which certainly kept her busy.
 “I was committed to that job, and it took up a large portion of my week,” Solecki admitted. “Taking college courses my last 2 years of high school and working part-time in a different state had its stressful moments, but it taught me to balance my effort and my stress.”
 She will be leaving Hampshire County in August, heading to Virginia Beach as a student at Regent University, where she’s planning on majoring in business with a concentration in accounting.
 “High school is where we learn about ourselves and about the world. Hampshire gave me an environment to grow and learn more about myself and what I wanted to do with my life,” she explained. “I look forward to this next chapter of my educational career.”

Primary ballots are being mailed out. On it are three Republicans running for the Arizona House in Legislative District 23, which includes Fountain Hills. Among all the serious problems our country currently faces, determining the person who will represent us in our State House is one of the most critical decisions we will make this summer.
 House Republicans hold only a one-seat advantage in the House. If that seat flips, issues such as low taxes, support for border control, personal liberty, school choice and quality of life can dramatically change. The individual we chose in our Republican Primary frankly must be the most talented, energetic candidate and the most determined individual we can send into the General Election against what promises to be a well-funded opponent. Electing the same old, same old will not suffice this time.

Effectively a floating storage platform, the Safer has had virtually no maintenance for five years since war broke out in the country where the Huthis have seized much of the north from the internationally recognized government.
 The tanker could break up or explode, causing a disaster that experts have said could take up to 30 years for the area's ecology to recover from.
 A leak in the engine room had been plugged in May, but the British mission to the UN insisted that "a permanent solution is urgently needed."
 "Its condition is deteriorating daily, increasing the potential for an oil spill," Inger Andersen, head of the United Nations Environment Programme, told the Council.
 "Time is running out for us now to act in a coordinated manner to prevent a looming environmental, economic and humanitarian catastrophe," she said.
 UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said he hoped a UN assessment mission would be carried out "within the next few weeks."
 "I have briefed you 15 times over the last 15 months on the Safer tanker," he added, hinting at frustration over the lack of action.
 Like other economic and aid issues in Yemen, the plight of the tanker has become a bargaining chip, with the Huthis accused of using the threat of disaster to secure control of the value of the cargo.
 In June, the Huthis said they wanted guarantees the vessel would be repaired and that the value of the oil on board used to pay salaries of their employees.
 But the Yemeni government has said the money for the oil should be used for health and humanitarian projects in the shattered country, which is again on the brink of famine after long years of conflict.
 Hodeida port is a lifeline for northern Yemen, with 90 per cent of all supplies coming through it.

BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) — Fans are trickling into Bristol Motor Speedway for Wednesday night’s All-Star race in NASCAR’s largest event with spectators since the coronavirus pandemic shut sports down in March. They were greeted by a plane flying over the Tennessee track that was pulling a banner of the Confederate flag, which NASCAR has banned from its races. IndyCar raced last weekend at Road America in Wisconsin and there was no limit on tickets sold to the event held on a 4-mile road course. Crowd estimates for that event have been around 10,000 spectators, but the NASCAR race would likely be the largest sporting event in the United States since March. The All-Star Race was moved from Charlotte Motor Speedway for just the second time since its 1985 inception because Tennessee officials allowed Speedway Motorsports to sell up to 30,000 tickets. North Carolina, where the race was held at Charlotte Motor Speedway its first year and every year since 1987, would not authorize spectators. Bristol, dubbed “The Last Great Colosseum,” can hold about 140,000 people. Speedway Motorsports has those in attendance socially distanced through the grandstands and masks were only required upon entrance. Fans were told they could remove them once in their seats. Because the speedway is privately owned, attendance numbers will not be released. Tickets were on sale through Tuesday evening and still available on Bristol's website until the deadline. Concession stands were open, but typical shopping opportunities were limited and independent street-side souvenir stands along Speedway Boulevard hawked driver items and even a few Confederate flags. NASCAR in June banned the flag at its events, but protesters at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama paraded past the main entrance waving them from their vehicles. A plane also flew over...

Online learning will give administrators time to set up schools safely, as well as learn from mistakes other districts will make.
 Our focus at this point might be to seek out stay-at-home parents willing to monitor small groups of elementary kids whose parents work and help those students with online education. Another task would be to make sure every student has a laptop and Internet service. Perhaps COVID funding could be used for this.
 I urge our district to play it safe.
