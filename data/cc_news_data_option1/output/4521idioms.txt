Wethouder Van Asten laat in een reactie weten 'trots' te zijn op het nieuwe kunstenplan. 'Daarin vinden we grote én kleine instellingen, internationaal bekende gezelschappen en musea én met laagdrempelige, gewortelde plekken voor kunst en cultuur, en een groot aantal nieuwkomers terug. We hebben bewuste scherpe keuzes gemaakt. Met dit Kunstenplan bouwen we aan een financieel gezonde en sterke sector, waarbinnen fair pay en inclusie speerpunten zijn. Hierdoor onstaat volop ruimte voor creativiteit en het experiment. Het is mijn wens dat het Haagse culturele aanbod divers, eigentijds en voor iedereen aantrekkelijk en toegankelijk blijft. In een stad met 180 nationaliteiten moet voor iedereen iets te doen zijn en voor iedereen iets te maken.'

It’s been a week since Dunlap was traded from the only team he’s played for in his NFL career after a contentious conclusion to his tenure in Cincinnati. Dunlap was clearly at odds with the Bengals’ coaching staff and the resolution ended up being his departure after 11 seasons.          He sees Seattle as a chance to be the missing piece to a team with the best record in the NFC and legitimate Super Bowl aspirations.          “My time clearly was up. Coaches came to that conclusion and we had to do what we had to do,” Dunlap said. “That’s part of the business. Guys are dealt throughout the year. ... But for me it was an opportunity to get a fresh start, to go to a team and organization that wanted me, clearly from the move that they made. And from talking to the coaches here, they want to use me playing to my strengths. They believe I still have plenty of juice in the tank.”

PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron France said on Thursday that France was tightening its border controls after a series of attacks that have hit the country in recent weeks.   Macron said the number of police and soldiers in charge of border controls will double from 2,400 now to 4,800. They will focus on tackling illegal immigration and smuggling activities, he said, during a visit to a border post in Perthus, on the border with Spain.   "We see very clearly that terrorist actions can in fact be carried out by some people who use migratory flows to threaten our territory. So we need to strengthen our controls for reasons of national security," Macron said.   Macron notably mentioned the Islamic extremist attack on the Notre-Dame basilica in Nice which left three dead last week. The main suspect, Ibrahim Issaoui, is a 21-year-old Tunisian who transited through Italy in September on his way to France. Issaoui is now in a French hospital after being injured by police during his arrest.   In addition, Macron said he would push for changes to bring controls to the European Unionmore efficient external borders.   "The attacks in France and Austria a few days ago in Vienna show us that the terrorist risk is everywhere, that (terrorist) networks are global … which is forcing Europe to step up its response," he said. he declares. France will present its proposals at a European summit in December.   The country raised its security alert to the maximum level after the Nice attack on October 29.   It was the third attack since Charlie hebdo reposted the cartoons of the Prophet of Islam in September when the trial for the 2015 bombings opened at the newspaper's offices and at a kosher supermarket. The gunmen in the attack claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group and to Al-Qaida, which recently called for new strikes against France.   Hervé Cazaux, director of the border police in the Perthus region, said police had arrested 11,200 people seeking to illegally cross the Franco-Spanish border so far this year, up from 5,500 last year.   This is partly explained by the lockdown of the spring pandemic in France, under which borders were closed until June 20, and by an increase in the number of migrants this summer, with many traveling via Spain from the Algeria and Morocco, Cazaux said.

The Seahawks hope Dunlap can bolster a pass rush that has been lacking all season. Seattle had three sacks last week against San Francisco but goes into this week’s game at Buffalo in the bottom third of the league with 12 sacks.          Last week’s win over the 49ers seemed to be a blueprint for what Seattle’s defense could accomplish by applying just a little bit of pressure on the quarterback. San Francisco’s Jimmy Garoppolo had limited mobility due to ankle problems, but a mix of blitzes and pressures — even when there wasn’t a sack — limited the 49ers. San Francisco had 117 total yards through three quarters and trailed by as many as 23 points before rallying late.          “The addition of Carlos also gives us a chance; we’re taking a step forward here,” Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. “I really am grateful that last week you could see that we got better. ... We’re going to try to add onto that and keep going.”          Seattle intends to use Dunlap in the LEO position on its defensive front. It’s essentially a pass-rushing defensive end, but Dunlap had not heard the term before getting in contact with Carroll and the Seahawks’ coaches to learn how he’d be used.          That should fit Dunlap just fine. Seattle wanted Dunlap in part because he can line up in several different spots on the defensive line. There was also the added benefit of Dunlap being under contract through next season, a contract he restructured slightly to help out the Seahawks as they try and navigate a tight salary cap.          “I have full confidence and faith in betting on myself. And betting with the Seahawks, who else would I want to bet with? It was like a win-win situation,” Dunlap said.

The Sally Sauer Community Medical Fund was established in the early 1990’s when Sally Sauer had a sudden illness that damaged her heart.  Our community stepped up and did what we do best.  We rallied together to help someone with a health need.  Funds left over after Sally’s financial needs were met, went into a fund to help others.  The Sally Sauer Community Medical Fund continues to function today, assisting folks with medical expenses – funded by the caring of our community. When a young girl named Amanda needed help, we each donated an hour’s wage in a campaign called “Hour Amanda”.  When Kyle Rosling needed heart surgery, his high school friends championed a drive called “Kids for Kyle”.  WINGS was created in 1997 to reach out to patients and families who have to travel outside of Lincoln County for cancer treatment -- assisting with food, travel and lodging.   Every year, we as a community dig deep and help fund this worthwhile program. Seems like there are always raffles, meals and a variety of benefits going on created by friends and relatives to help out someone they love who is/has suffered an injury, surgery or cancer. Many, many times we have banded together to help our community members who are facing a medical need/crisis.
