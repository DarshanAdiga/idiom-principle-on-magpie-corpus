The Emperor showing off his swivel chair (“it spins both ways”) to Kylo, or insisting Emperor is higher in the pecking order than Supreme Leader makes one grin as does Vader’s backpedaling from “My Son!” to Luke on Tatooine to say, “My, these binary suns.”
 After Rey watches all the masters with their Padawans and realises the eternal truth, she makes it back to the Millennium Falcon in time for the celebrations, including a rendition of a Huttese song to the tune of ‘Jingle Bells.’

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson acknowledged the frustration of people self-isolating due to coronavirus and thanked them for their “incredibly important” actions.
 The Prime Minister posted a video update online from Downing Street, where he himself continues to isolate, and joked that he had finally been “put under house arrest”.
 “Bear in mind what you are doing is incredibly important because that is how we are going to break the chain of transmission, stop the disease, get the R down as I believe we are doing at the moment and get it under control,” he said.

At Friday’s Nebraska State Fair Board meeting, board member Jeremy Jensen said he would like more information about the new deputy executive director position that the State Fair plans to add.
 Looking at the proposed 2021 budget, Jensen said he was caught off-guard by a reference to a staff member who reports to the deputy executive director. It was the first he knew of a deputy director position in the works.
 Jensen said he would like to know the job duties and salary structure of positions being created. He noted personnel costs in the proposed budget already total $1.5 million.
 State Fair Executive Director Bill Ogg said there is a need for a deputy director. The fair, he said, requires an administrative person who is focused on the budget, human resources and other matters.

In 1963, the Bowes-Lyon family _reported_ to _Burke 's Peerage_, the guidebook to the British aristocracy, that both of the sisters had died, Nerissa in 1940 and Katherine in 1961. The reality of the matter was that Nerissa died in 1986, merely a year before the scandal broke, while Katherine lived until 2014. In 1987, when _The Sun_ broke the news that the supposedly dead sisters had been very much alive--and secretly institutionalized--all along, Harold Brooks-Baker, an editor at _Burke 's Peerage_, was stunned to learn of the inaccuracy. He defended the time-honored tradition of _Burke 's Peerage_ taking royals at their word, but expressed shock that the royals would knowingly erase their relatives from the public record.
 "If this is what the Bowes-Lyon family told us, then we would have included it in the book," Brooks-Baker _said_. "It is not normal to doubt the word of members of the royal family."
 The Queen Mother reportedly _learned_ of the Bowes-Lyon sisters in 1982, having believed them dead until that year. Yet financial records suggest that someone in the royal household knew of the sisters, as the royals annually _sent_ 125 pounds for their care and keeping at Earlswood. After learning that her nieces were, in fact, alive, the Queen Mother sent them a check, which was used to purchase candy and toys, but she did not visit her nieces, nor did she correct the public record in _Burke 's Peerage_. In 1986, the Queen Mother _became_ the patron of the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults, which describes itself as "the leading voice of learning disability."  
 When _The Sun_ 's 1987 investigation broke news of the scandal, some interpreted the Queen Mother's failure to correct the public record and her timely patronage as evidence of a royal cover-up. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, _calling_ the matter "an issue for the Bowes-Lyon family." It also came to light that three other members of the Bowes-Lyon family with similar developmental disabilities were placed at Earlswood on the very same day as Katherine and Nerissa: their cousins, the three sisters Idonea, Etheldreda, and Rosemary Bowes-Lyon. Brits were uniquely outraged by the details of Nerissa's death in 1986, after which she was _buried_ in a pauper's grave at a funeral attended by only Earlswood staff members. Her grave was signified by just plastic tags and a serial number, until a tombstone was added after public outrage. The hearts of Brits everywhere went out to Katherine--so much so that she _received_ flowers from all over the nation.

“There are certain things that have gone against us and it is a roller coaster of a football club.
 “We have had some fantastic times over the last three or four years and have to take the downside on the chin and roll with the punches.”
 Wilder could be boosted by the return of Lys Mousset and John Fleck against the Hammers. Striker Mousset and midfielder Fleck have both resumed full training and are in contention to play a part in the game on Sunday.
 Mousset has yet to feature at all this campaign after suffering a tendon injury in a pre-season friendly while Fleck has been out with a back problem since the beginning of October.
 There is doubt over the availability of Norway midfielder Sander Berge, who has been in quarantine after international team-mate Omar Elabdellaoui tested positive for Covid-19.
 Wilder said: “We are waiting for instruction from Sander, as with a couple of other boys (international players). He is in that category with a question mark.”

Ms Mytton also praised the work of staff to get the site up and running with just a week’s notice.
 Last minute plans included using voting booths intended for use at the May 2021 Welsh Parliament instead being used to self-administer test swabs, after dedicated booths supposed to be sent by the UK Government failed to show.
 She said: “To get it up and running, get the staff and volunteers, it’s been an incredible effort and I’m so proud everyone’s pulled together.”
 Lateral flow tests give results within 20 to 30 minutes, with people who test positive then given a traditional swab test and asked to return home so they can self-isolate immediately.
 The pilot will be supported by 165 military personnel, with Brigadier Andrew Dawes, Commander Joint Military Command Wales, one of the first people to get a test on Saturday.
 Last week, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the pilot, which follows one already in place in Liverpool, would provide “vital understanding” on how mass testing can be rolled out across the UK.

Now, a word of warning about investing inspiration in bluebirds and finding beauty in the royal blue of the males and the elegant gray of the females. Bluebirds have the capacity of dispersing, flying away in directions unknowable and unpredictable. Yet even in the frosty northern parts of the country, some of them remain. The Michigan Bluebird Society offers counsel on how to keep them around in backyard birdhouses: "First, plug up any ventilation openings or holes with weather stripping or removable caulking to keep cold air out."
 In the case of politics, of course, it is the hot air that is the danger. But the point stands, though there remains danger that the two major political parties -- the one that could not have imagined a decade ago that Joe Biden would be its savior, the other that could not have imagined that Trump would be its leader -- could fly apart. For as Lynn, who died earlier this year at age 103, would teach us in her unforgettable ballad of inspiration, we simply must "wait and see." And hope.

Good morning. I’m Paul Thornton, and it is Saturday, Nov. 21, 2020. California’s nearly statewide coronavirus curfew takes effect at 10 p.m. tonight. Let’s take a look back at the week in Opinion.
 This was supposed to be around the time that this newsletter would transition to discussing forward-looking pieces on policy and culture, and away from reacting to whatever outrage President Trump had recently inflicted on us. Even with the president’s lame duck-induced irrelevance, there would have been plenty to be alarmed about with the coronavirus — but in a slightly more sane universe, we’d be focusing on the incoming Biden administration’s pandemic response plan developed with the help of service-minded Trump White House officials, even if the president himself had checked out for a 60-day sulk.
 Problem is, there aren’t enough service-minded people around the president or in the Republican Party to blunt the effects of Trump’s post-election fit, which involves him not only refusing to do his job but also attempting to stage what can honestly be called a coup. His behavior alarmed some of our readers enough for them to call for a second impeachment.
 Most disturbing has been the willingness of entrenched mainstream Republicans and political appointees to enable the obstruction of the next administration’s transition. Of particular interest is Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administration, who has effectively blocked anyone in the executive branch from formally working with the Biden transition. Before the election, scarcely anyone outside Washington had heard of her; now, says columnist Virginia Heffernan, she is sure to go down in history as another one of Trump’s loyal liars.

The Joanna C is a 45ft scalloping vessel registered in Brixham, the Coastguard said, and three people were aboard when it sank.
 The search continues for the two missing crewmen.
 As well as the RNLI lifeboats, the Birling Gap Coastguard Rescue Team is checking for sightings from the shore.
 Another fishing vessel close to the area is helping with the search, while the Coastguard rescue helicopter based in the Solent has been deployed to relieve the Kent-based aircraft.
 HM Coastguard controller Piers Stanbury said: “Thankfully one of the three people on board at the time of sinking has been pulled out of the water and brought to shore by the Newhaven RNLI lifeboat but the intensive air and sea search for the two missing crew continues.
 “Debris has been located close to the location of the EPIRB alert location but no life raft has been found as yet.”

Sheridan County officials ponder mask enforcement
 SHERIDAN (WNE) — “What level are we going to take to actually enforce it?” Sheridan County Fulmer Public Library Director Cameron Duff posed to his board of directors.
 The question lingers for business owners and government building overseers after a health order requiring masks in government buildings and businesses went into effect Wednesday.
 Fulmer Library board members defaulted to Duff’s plan. He posted signs noting the mask requirement and will ensure staff wears masks. Beyond that, he wasn’t sure whether to call law enforcement or not for anyone not complying with the order.
 Duff told staff not to get into confrontations over the mask order.
 “I’ve spoken with the county, and they said the same,” Duff said. “Do the best you can but don’t get into confrontation that puts the staff at risk of some sort of altercation.”
 In addition to those refusing to wear masks potentially causing issues, Duff said certain patrons wearing masks may also become upset if others are not wearing masks and following the order.
 “That’s what I’ve done this far, but I’m really struggling with the idea of what to do with enforcement,” Duff said, noting he doesn’t think it’s a viable option to call law enforcement every time someone comes in without wearing a face covering.
 Campbell County employees required to use masks
 GILLETTE (WNE) — In response to a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the community, Campbell County Commissioners approved a temporary policy requiring its employees to wear masks, effective immediately.
 The policy was approved on a 4-1 vote Tuesday morning, with Commissioner Bob Maul the lone vote against it.
 The policy requires employees to “wear a face mask while at work unless they are alone in their office or vehicle.” Exceptions can be made for those who cannot wear a mask because of a health condition. In addition to face coverings, employees will be asked to continue other preventative measures such as social distancing, frequent hand washing and disinfecting surfaces.
 The commissioners remain opposed to a countywide mask mandate for the public because they don’t want to dictate the general public’s behavior, but they believe requiring county employees to wear masks is the least they can do to slow the spread of COVID-19.
 “I don’t think anyone can ignore the fact that we’ve got a problem, and as a society we need to try to do the right thing,” said Commissioner Del Shelstad.
 Brandy Elder, the county’s human resources director, wrote the policy. She said that in the past few weeks, there have been county offices around the state, hers included, that “have been almost entirely shut down because of an exposure, which could’ve been easily prevented had we been taking precautions.”
 She now requires her employees to wear a mask when on the job but not in their office.

Lady Elizabeth Anson, the granddaughter of Fenella Bowes-Lyon and the niece of Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon, disputed claims of a cover-up. She _described_ her grandmother as "a very vague person [who] often did not fill out forms completely that _Burke 's Peerage _sent her." However, an editor for _DeBrett 's_, a peerage guide much like _Burke 's Peerage_, _commented_, "an oversight like that doesn't happen."
 In 1996, when Earlswood was shut down, the administrator of the hospital, Peter Kinsey, contacted the next-of-kin of all patients to inform them of the shutdown and discuss next steps. Kinsey _contacted_ the Queen and the Queen Mother, but both declined to take a meeting about Katherine's future, and Buckingham Palace released no comment. Katherine lived out the rest of her life in another care facility, where she died in 2014 at the age of 87, without the royal family ever publicly acknowledging her existence.  
 Though little is conclusively known about the royal family's knowledge or complicity in the trajectory of the Bowes-Lyons sisters' lives, Morgan paints a damning picture of a family determined to hold onto power, whatever the cost. In 1987, a genetic expert _determined_ that all five Bowes-Lyons women suffered from a genetic disorder, which did not affect the Queen or her heirs. _The Crown_ leans into the eugenics of it all, hypothesizing that the Queen Mother knowingly consigned her nieces to a terrible fate in the name of keeping the bloodline pure.
