Flexibility, reliability, and creativity are the three main aspects of service that Talisman Casualty is committed to providing. "In the captive insurance model, a smaller number of principals are participating in the coverage capacity so the relationship can be more personal and the design of the bonds can be flexible to meet the needs of the modern business environment and evolving risk which require more flexibility," the insurance company says. "Access to surety credit can seem like an unstable marketplace where availability and willingness to bond contracts are unpredictable. Managing risk in business is much more challenging if bonded contracts are key to stay competitive."

All three parties - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens - will announce the results of their ballots on Friday evening, leading to a vote for Taoiseach in Dublin's Convention Centre on Saturday.
 There had been suggestions that should the programme not pass, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would scramble to ensure the support of a number of independents in order to secure the vote for Michéal Martin as Taoiseach.
 However, Fianna Fáil TD Darragh O'Brien, who was a member of the party's negotiating team, insists all eyes are on Friday. He said he was confident the deal would pass his party.
 "Genuinely, I'm not looking past Friday. At the end of the day, we believe that the right thing to do would be to pass it, so that's where our focus is."

With the government's PPP money and the Small Business Administration, loans or gifts, our dealers were able to stay fairly healthy and we've been very pleased about the lack of write-offs or things but you never know and actually getting back open in our case for sure as a manufacturer but in as retail, it cost more money than to shut down. And so there'll be some cash things and we're just being prudent looking at the future. But no major other things other than Art Van and thankful for that and the government's idea of helping out small businesses really reflected in our lack of challenges.

 “We aren’t sure about the fate of IPL this season. Moreover, with the economy in a bad shape, chances of getting a new sponsor at the same price are remote, to say the least. I am not sure whether this is a wise move,” he said.
 Mobile handset manufacturer Vivo shells out approximately ₹440 crore per IPL edition. Byju’s, the Indian team’s main sponsor, pays ₹4.61 crore for each of India’s international matches, except those in ICC events (₹1.56 crore per match).
 ## Sleight of hand
 Ad film director and entrepreneur Prahlad Kakkar offered a solution. “It’s a no-brainer that you can’t get the same price should you decide to replace the sponsor. Instead, it’s best to make them pay for the sponsorship deals and boycott the products,” Kakkar told _The Hindu_. “That’s a good Indian rhetoric: Take money from one hand and don’t pass it on from another. It’s called a sleight of hand or divine justice.”
 Interestingly, even if the BCCI decides to follow Kakkar’s prescription, captain Virat Kohli, who is the brand ambassador of Vivo India, will find himself in a difficult situation.

Admitting that the longer-range implications of COVID-19 hold the possibility of an economic recession, the Argus paper says “… all bets are off on exactly what our recovery will look like” but that it's tied to the stock market. “As the dust begins to settle we will gain more clarity on what our industry will look like in the coming months. However, if the short term trends are any indication, we will probably return to 15% - 20% of normal in July and August with activity showing a closer correlation to the ease of quarantine and stay at home orders. That should change as we enter late summer and early fall with a better understanding of the financial impact and this is where we can expect flight activity to become more sensitive to what is happening on Wall Street. If the financial damage isn’t too bad then our industry should be able to make up the remaining losses over the next 12-18 months. If the financial impact turns out to be deeper then we will be looking at a slower rise for that last 15% - 20%,” the report says.

The good news is that stores are open and plants are up and running. While we're cautiously optimistic, we will need to remain as agile as possible to manage through this near-term period. More broadly speaking, I would note that no trends should be drawn from our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter margin performance given the many dramatic and unique impacts of COVID-19 shut down. While our plants are ramping up production on a weekly basis, we still have not reached prior year volume levels or even critical sales levels to support our historically strong margins. Only time will tell, if what we were seeing in terms of volume increases is solely pent up demand, the impact of federal stimulus money or longer term sector rotation with discretionary spending, moving from travel and leisure to home and furnishing all may be playing a role in the bounce back of the home furnishings industry that we are experiencing. Whether that demand is sustainable, and what the new normal will be, are still questions. Thus, we continue to balance meeting customer demand for our products with financial prudence.

The entire teaching in the Gita clearly shows how the paths of karma, jnana and bhakti get subsumed in the act of surrender or prapatti. The Karma Yoga propounded is preparatory and enables jnana to take root in the prapanna. The knowledge of the immortal atma swaroopa and of the impermanent body is the Adyatma jnana that engenders bhakti. Bhakti too has stages, says Krishna. But when one reaches the state of being steeped in savouring the endless glories of the Almighty, the desire for moksha and attaining God’s feet becomes paramount.
 Prapatti assures this for the prapanna, pointed out Sri Asuri Madhavachariar in a discourse. Krishna also points out that the five karmendriyas and five jnanendriyas along with the mind are a strong team and to subdue them is essential. First of all the senses are all outward bound and to subdue them one has to turn their focus inward. It is not enough to refrain from seeing, hearing, etc, those things that have to be avoided. You can put a physical distance between sense objects and yourself. But the more powerful force is the mind that has to be restrained and controlled from straying towards the sense objects. If there is lingering longing, there is no yoga. But when the mind is under control, one can get closer to the atma. Closeness with the atma leads to closeness with God.
 When the mind is steeped in God, one is unaffected by the worldly glitter. Then one can attain the state of experiencing the presence of God as Prahlada. Such was the child’s vision when he asserted that God is present in his father as much as He is in pillar. This is the highest state of a yogi and the Stitaprajna is one such yogi whose equanimity of mind makes him remain unaffected by worldly pulls.

 However, Indian staff members have alleged their Chinese employers misbehaved with them and the pandemic was only an excuse to remove them. When contacted by _The Hindu_ , an Indian representative of the firm refused to comment and said MOIL would be able to answer queries instead.
 “When the firm refused to take back its employees residing outside, all Indian, for the time being, we told them to employ them immediately otherwise suspend operations. As their response wasn’t satisfactory, we directed them to stop work on June 19,” said Mr. Bhati.
 The affected employees include 40 workers, supervisors, engineers, blasters, translators, cooks, helpers and operators. “We have given them the option of working with other contractors. And many have picked up work too,” he added. While contractors take up time-bound projects, workers switch workplaces after their completion.
 “Around 40% of the work, which began a year or so ago, has been completed,” said Mr. Bhati.
 The Indian employees last week approached the District Collector alleging the firm denied them work thinking they were infected and asked them to approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek help. “The episode has no relation to the ongoing Indo-China conflict,” said Deepak Arya, Collector.
 Mr. Arya explained that the lockdown in view of the pandemic had disrupted the work cycle of Chinese employees. “Every six months, Chinese workers are rotated. But now, neither can they call new ones, or send these back home. Therefore they are frustrated too. They have requested us to send them back home.”
 Further, he added, entry of infected citizens back into China was restricted. “This caused the firm to ask employees coming from outside to stay away, fearing infection.
 On the campus, there are 12 other Indian staff members, including cooks and translators. “We have informed the firm it will not be allowed to operate without taking back all Indian workers,” said District Collector Deepak Arya.
 The firm has paid each worker ₹5,000 to tide them over the unemployment. “They have told us they may employ us after three months. How will we survive until then?” asked Sitesh Kathoute, 29, who made ₹700-750 a day as a driller but is now left without pay.
 Most were loath to work with other employers, he said. “From the options we have, work often doesn’t continue for long with those contractors, and payments are irregular. No one among us has had COVID-19, then why discriminate against us like this?” asked Mr. Kathoute, who feeds an eight- member family. In the past three months, his family has accrued a debt of ₹1.5 lakh, consisting of a loan to buy a two-wheeler and money borrowed from neighbours to buy food.
