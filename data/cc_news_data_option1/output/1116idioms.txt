 Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!
 Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.
 Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.
 Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.
 You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.
 You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.
 If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.

And they are far from alone here, where it seems every second person you meet is a second homeowner.
 And it is this, some in the town claim, that is responsible for all the people on the streets.
 Laura Cliff, who runs the Little Gems grocery store, says her trade this most recent weekend was three times what it would usually be.
 Many second-home owners, it seems, have either decamped to Southwold or have stayed on there in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
 “We have a lot of second-home owners here who have decided to stay and people are really keen to buy fresh produce to stay healthy,” says Ms Cliff.

For the first time since 1954, the Formula One race will not take place in Monaco in May this year after Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM) announced the cancellation of the race in the wake of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Earlier, the F1 had announced that the Monaco Grand Prix--which was scheduled to take place on May 24--will be postponed along with the Dutch and Spanish Grands Prix. However, the ACM clarified that they have decided to cancel the race with great sadness . Reflecting on the development,the Automobile Club de l Ouest (ACO) said, The current situation concerning the worldwide pandemic and its unknown path of evolution, the lack of understanding as to the impact on the FIA F1 World Championship 2020, the uncertainty with regards to the participation of the teams, the consequences with regards to the differing measures of confinement as taken by various governments worldwide, the multi-border restrictions for accessing the Principality of Monaco, the pressure on all implicated businesses, their dedicated staff who are unable to undertake the necessary installations, the availability of the indispensable workforce and volunteers (more than 1500) required for the success of the event means that the situation is no longer tenable.” The ACO further clarified that under no circumstances it is possible to reschedule these events later in the year, the F1 official website reported. The Monaco Grand Prix began in 1929 and it has been held without fail since 1955. Meanwhile, the Historic Monaco Grand Prix, which takes place before the F1 race, has also been cancelled. The virus outbreak, which was first reported in December 2019 from Wuhan city of China, has so far claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people and has affected more than 2,40,000 persons globally. Due to coronavirus, many sports tournaments have been cancelled, while some of them are postponed.

O’Keeffe, who headed up the GAA’s Games Administration Committee from 2003 to 2006 before later taking over the Central Competitions Control Committee in 2013 for two years, believes a knock-out Championship is the way to go.
 “My own fear is either the league or the championship won’t be played,” he said. “Only one of them will be played because you won’t be able in such a short space of time to do both. And you will want a lot of club involvement then because it means a lot to a huge amount of members, and nationally there would be huge engagement.”
 Club schedules are already changing, but O’Keeffe knows counties will be loath to cancel their own competitions and he suggests they are “probably” more important than the National League.
 “In Kerry, people are very much in favour of the divisional set-up and the fact they have the divisional championships in winter. They usually take about six weeks of games and that’s after the club and county championships.”
 Looking at the current situation in China, where the virus originated, O’Keeffe estimates a June or July resumption for GAA activity might be on the cards.

Prince Harry may have stepped down as a senior member of the British royal family but the drama still follows him wherever he goes.
 As per the latest intel, the Duke of Sussex's relationship with his brother Prince William, which already had been quite shaky, is hitting the skids following the royal family drama that came afloat after Harry and Meghan Markle took an exit.
 As per _Us Weekly_ citing a source, the two brothers are filled to the core with "resentment and anger."
 "Harry knows William's mad at him for uprooting and leaving him to pick up the pieces. But the way Harry sees it, Meghan's happiness is way more important....Harry's fed up with being judged or expected to act a certain way," the source revealed.
 This comes after an insider had previously revealed to the same publication about the hostility that has always been rife between the two siblings.
 "There's always been a part of Harry that felt like he was living in his brother's shadow. He doesn't envy the responsibility that comes with being the future king of England, but William's the 'golden boy' and Harry feels like he has a lot to live up to," the grapevine had said.

“It was very quick. Our chief scientific officer worked on SARS over 15 years ago. When we saw COVID coming over, she basically felt compelled that this is something that we need to work on,” Hu explained. “We leveraged everything from the learnings of that SARS experiment, that blood antibodies test, to quickly come up to speed and develop this antibody test.
 “Usually it takes about a year to develop, but we have to applaud the FDA for really recognizing the urgent need for testing and making it easier for folks with high quality tests to get out there.”
 County officials, like others in the field, have been frustrated about the lack of testing availability across the nation. As of Thursday, the county had administered 38 tests, with 13 coming back negative. They're still waiting on results for the other 25.
 Grundy explained how officials will handle and monitor tests. A person who tests negative twice is at risk of contracting the virus, while a person who tests positive twice is in the clear.
 “You had it. You may have been asymptomatic or it might have been (what you thought was) a cold you had over Christmas. You’re safe. You have produced the antibodies,” she said.

BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday hailed the Supreme Court judgement on holding a floor test in the Madhya Pradesh assembly and said the Kamal Nath-led Congress governments fall is imminent. Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava and state BJP president V D Sharma also welcomed the judgement.The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker N P Prajapati to convene a special session on Friday for conducting the floor test which must conclude by 5 pm. A bench, headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud, also ordered video recording and possible live streaming of the Assembly proceedings when the Kamal Nath-led Congress government undertakes the floor test.Truth has prevailed, attempts to lure away MLAs, by all means, proved futile, Chouhan said, reacting to the SC order. This is a defeat of plans of Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, the BJP vice- president said.The government will not be able to clear the floor test. We have full faith that this government will fall in the floor test. It will make things crystal clear, the former chief minister said while talking to reporters here. After the fall of this government, ways will be cleared for formation of a new government in the state, Chouhan added.State BJP president V D Sharma also welcomed the judgement, saying it has totally exposed Nath and his government. Talking to PTI, senior BJP legislator Bhargava said, We welcome this decision. Governor Lalji Tandon had given a similar directive to the Chief Minister. This will uphold democratic traditions and check horse-trading. Asked if the rebel Congress MLAs currently lodged in Bengaluru will come here to participate in the House proceedings, Bhargava said, This will depend on them and how secure they are feeling.When a leader like Jyotiraditya Scindia former union minister who has joined BJP can be attacked, how can they feel secure. Their participation depends on their will. Bhargava said the Kamal Nath government was reduced to a minority after the resignations of 22 rebel MLAs of the ruling Congress.Resignations of six of them have been accepted by the speaker, while a decision is pending on the remaining 16 Congress legislators. In the 230-member Assembly, the current strength of the Congress is 108 resignations of 16 of its legislators is on hold.If these 16 resignations are accepted by the speaker or if these MLAs abstain during assembly proceeding, the number of Congress members will be reduced to 92. On the other hand, the opposition BJP has 107 members in the house.The BJP had paraded 106 legislators before the Governor on Monday. One of its MLAs, Narayan Tripathi, was absent during the parade and was seen with Congress MLAs after assembly proceedings that day. The overall strength of the house has been reduced to 222 after the resignations of six MLAs were accepted by the speaker. Two seats are lying vacant.The BSP has two MLAs, while the SP has one and there are four independents legislators. All these MLAs BSP, SP and independents- had extended their support to the Congress during the formation of government in December 2018.In the existing situation, the majority mark is 112. In case of acceptance of resignations of 16 rebel Congress legislators, the overall house strength will drop to 206.If 16 MLAs currently staying in Bengaluru abstain, the majority mark in the house will fall to 104.

The world has perhaps rarely been more rife with cabin fever, and it’s quite likely to get worse.
 The good news is that the cure also works to relieve stress and anxiety and, done right, it aligns with acceptable social distancing practices meant to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
 So if you are feeling cooped up and maybe unable to shake a feeling of dread, get outside, stretch your legs, breathe in the fresh air and revel in the healing power of nature.
 Go for a hike, ride a bike, wet a line — just don’t do it in large groups, and take the same social distancing precautions you are applying to other aspects of your new daily routine.
 “We are in this beautiful outdoor area, and there is no COVID-19 out in the forest,” said Kelly McGrath, an Orofino physician and a proponent of outdoor recreation as an important component to healthy living. “If I didn’t have to be at work right now, that is where I would be. It’s safe, it’s good for you, I think there is great evidence it helps us all mentally, psychologically and physically.”
 Amid an avalanche of facility closures and event cancelations, the outdoors remain as open as ever. Although some indoor facilities associated with parks and forests, such as visitor centers, are shuttered or restricted, state parks in both Idaho and Washington are open, and federal land is as well.
 “You are going to have to get away from the house once in a while,” said Charlie Chase, manager of Hells Gate State Park at Lewiston. “But you don’t want to be in any groups, so let’s go for a hike or a bike ride — something that will at least let you get out.”
 It’s likely a good idea to go in small groups, such as with your family, avoid carpooling and when you meet others on a trail to keep the recommended 6 feet of separation.
 “Say you and your wife are out on the trail and here comes a bunch of people; step off the trail for a little bit until they pass. That social distancing is very important in keeping the spread of the disease down,” Chase said.
 The information desk at the Lewis Clark Discovery Center at Hells Gate State Park is open, so people can check into the campground and ask questions. However, the interpretive displays at the center are closed.
 Washington state parks remain open for outdoor recreation, but visitor centers are closed and group events have been canceled. So too are the parks’ normal offerings of planned programming.
 Mike Kinziger, a retired University of Idaho education professor who specializes in recreation, said there is a plethora of outdoor activities to be had, especially for families. They include things like cross-country skiing, shed hunting, bird-watching, looking for early spring wildflowers, rock hounding, photography and learning how to identify local trees and vegetation.
 “It takes away the stress and gets you doing things together. It might be a great time for families to reconnect with the outdoors and with each other,” Kinziger said. “Kids can learn so much right now. What are kids going to remember 30 or 40 years from now. They are not going to remember sitting in their rooms and playing video games.”
 Mike Beiser, a retired outdoor recreation program director at the University of Idaho, said dispersed recreation — that which is not concentrated — is a good way to break up the monotony of otherwise trying to stay at home. So while recreation centers, gyms and even some outdoor destinations like ski resorts are closed, walking on a trail, or even the Lewiston levee, remains available.
 “I think we need to do something every day. It’s good to get out in the fresh air,” Beiser said. “People need to have fun and go out, but avoid other people and (practice) physical distancing. If you want to connect with someone, you can do that online.”

VIRGINIA — Rob Ecklund was on a working group call this week to discuss Minnesota’s unemployment insurance with fellow legislators when Zoom, an online video conferencing host, crashed.
 The moment brimmed with irony for the DFL state representative from International Falls, who self-describes as not technologically savvy, but is also the leading voice in the Legislature on issues of broadband connectivity.
 As cases of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and precautionary measures to slow its spread across Minnesota have been put in place in recent weeks, the state is facing a new reality: Schools are closed, thousands of employees are working from home, including at the State Office Building in St. Paul, which he described as a “ghost town.”
 For Ecklund, living in a rural city along the Canadian border, his district is a hotspot for the broadband discussion because of its lack of access and, well, community hotspots. He can think of four people within a couple of miles of his home struggling to work from their apartments and houses because of internet service.
 “We’re using it everywhere we can,” he said in a phone interview Thursday. “A lot of people are using it from home. It definitely shows our border to border broadband is not sufficient.”
 On the Iron Range and rural St. Louis County, broadband gaps are commonplace.
 It’s estimated that hundreds of families lack internet connection at home and a statewide survey in 2019 show nearly two-thirds of Minnesotans underserved or not served by internet providers.
 Expanding broadband access in Greater Minnesota was among the top campaign priorities of Gov. Tim Walz, and in May 2019, he signed a $40 million grant program to improve access over the next biennium.
 Last October, Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan appointed a 14-member broadband task force that included Steve Giorgi, executive director of the Range Association of Municipalities and Schools, and Jim Weikum, the mayor of Biwabik and executive director of the Arrowhead Library System.
 For Giorgi and RAMS, the broadband issue has been among their calling cards in the last year and mandated school closings this week only accelerated the effort.
 In a letter sent to RAMS members on March 18, Giorgi offered a temporary solution that members could act on to help students connect while they’re out of the classroom, through the Northeast Service Coop in Mountain Iron, which said it was willing to increase bandwidth and install Wi-Fi hotspots in parking lots, town halls or other locations where their fiber network is in place.
 “Many schools, city halls and town halls have taken steps to minimize Wi-Fi signals into their parking lots or adjoining spaces to assure there is not an abuse of the broadband,” Giorgi wrote. “During these trying times, we believe those circumstances can be mitigated and you can at least provide students with locations to access Wi-Fi.”
 The Arrowhead Library System encouraged its members to provide free Wi-Fi access while they are now closed. Its headquarters in Mountain Iron, along with libraries in at least Mountain Iron and Virginia are following the advice, with Virginia posting its password on the sign outside the building.
 At Virginia Public Schools, providing Wi-Fi access to students in need was in the early stage of the district’s contingency planning. They’re using the state mandated closing period, which runs through at least March 27, to fully develop distance learning plans. The technology department emailed a survey to parents Wednesday seeking to gather information about access, providers and data caps on services, while outlining where school-issued service is available.
 In Mountain Iron-Buhl and St. Louis County Schools, the broadband challenge stretches to the region’s more remote areas. At an emergency school board meeting March 16, Superintendent Dr. Reggie Engebritson said teachers were making special arrangements for students lacking access, including sending home packets of assignments and lessons.
 Ecklund said Thursday the $30 million he proposed for broadband funding this year may not be possible as the Legislature’s focus remains on the coronavirus response and bonding, but said another dose of funding is still possible.
 Last year the state had more than $75 million in broadband requests and the pandemic situation is only opening more eyes to access gaps, he said, noting some areas that were up to speed five year ago are becoming underserved as technology changes.
 He added that $30 million a year in the base budget is a target figure, but said the high amount would need a sunset clause once the system is built out.
 “We’re getting there,” Ecklund said. “What we’re getting to now is out in the areas where the driveways are a quarter-mile long and the homes are really spread out. We’re getting to the tougher and tougher places to serve. We may need to work quickly when this whole coronavirus settles down.”

When Dublin and Kerry squared off on the opening night of the football league in January, it took until shortly before half-time for the first advanced mark of the campaign to be taken. Conor McHugh won the ball, claimed the mark, and kicked it over the bar. Just like that. The wonder was that it took so long to arrive.
 The only other two advanced marks came late on, both of which yielded key scores. Three in total seemed a light load, especially after so much chaos surrounding the mark was anticipated when the final clarifications and interpretations on the new rules were only released days beforehand.
 Dublin and Kerry didn’t really have time to practise the mark. That was obvious because when both sides tried to secure an advanced mark, the timing of their kicks, and the forwards runs, were too often off line to nail them.
 Over that opening weekend, there was 0-17 scored from advanced marks. Laois though, skewed the average because they bagged four points from advanced marks, from four different players – Colm Murphy, Evan O’Carroll, Kieran Lillis and Ross Munnelly.
 That wasn’t a total surprise either because much of Laois’s promotion from Division 3 last year had centred on the ability of O’Carroll and Donie Kingston to claim possessions. O’Carroll and Kingston were even more proficient at the tactic because both are quality freetakers.

BGMEA - the country's apex trade body in the garment sector - has projected a very highly bleak business situation as the outbreak of Coronavirus have started hitting the industry from all sides.   The industry related website RMG Bangladesh reported Thursday that buyers are increasingly cancelling and as well as suspending orders no matter how it is going to hurt the industry.   BGMEA (Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association) leaders said as of March 18 afternoon,  a total of 69 factories had informed the trade body that buyers have asked for cancellation or suspension of  buying orders to the tune of US$ 93.63 million (over Taka 9.30 crore) till afternoon of March 18.   Buyers' messages for cancellation of orders were reported by 20 factories in four hours as of March 17 afternoon involving US$ 17.2 million business orders. Suspension of export orders on that day stood at US$ 1.33 million which stands at Taka 13.38 lakhs in local currency.   BGMEA leaders mainly blamed major dislocation in the buying market in the USA and Europe where business chain has broken as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus causing shut down to major distribution lines and business outlets.   Buyers are not placing new buying order and increasingly going for cancellation or suspension of existing orders. Buyers have already stopped placing orders and asking factory owners to stop production of clothes under existing buying orders.   They said garment production at first faced setback as a result of disruption of garments raw materials supply from China.  Now the supply line is slowly becoming stable but the buyers' market is now failing.  The industry is facing a total uncertainty in this situation, BGMEA President Rubana Haq said.   She said this is no doubt a global setback but expressed anger saying this is a critical time for the industry. It is not justified for buyers in this situation to think of their business interest alone, they must also share producers concerns.   This is a life and death issue for the industry; she said and wonders where the industry will now stand. Garments factory owners have to pay salary for workers and Eid bonuses. It is a total disaster, she said.   She also raised question what the industry will now do with the cloths already made and in stock and how they will pay for raw materials. She calls for the government help in this situation.

The Delhi High Court on Friday said that the delay in filing mercy plea by the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case shows there is a conspiracy and that someone is playing with the system. A bench comprising justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula said there has been gross delay in filing mercy plea and requested the counsel appearing for the convicts to present a substantial legal point.
 The lawyer urged the high court to defer hanging by 3-4 days so that he can address his case. However, the bench said this is the fourth death warrant in the matter and there has already been "gross delay" on the part of the convicts.
 "You have to make out a case for stay. We cannot grant stay of execution without you making out a good case for it. Such a casual approach by you. "At 11'o clock we are saying please come to the point. You are not coming to the point," the bench said in a late night hearing.
 It further added that there was no foundation in the plea requesting the lawyer to put up a substantial legal point. "There is very limited time now, so if you have a legal point come to it. Or you can carry on till the cows come home," the bench said.
 It asked the convicts' lawyer not to waste time as at 5.30 am the plea would become infructuous. "We are very close to the time when your clients will meet God. Don't waste it," the bench said When hearing commenced, the bench said the petition on behalf of the three convicts lacked material particulars like affidavits and memo (list) of parties which are essential components of a plea.
 The lawyer of the convicts claimed that the material particulars were missing due to paucity of time as he was running from trial court to the Supreme Court and then the high court. To this, the bench said only in India courts are so accessible as the convicts have moved the trial court, Supreme Court and the high court on the same day.
 At the outset, the court said that pendency of a divorce plea of convict Akshay Kumar Singh's wife was not relevant to stay his execution. It also said that the Supreme Court has already held that the pending divorce plea was no longer relevant.
 The bench added that the apex court's judgement confirming death sentence has attained finality and the court cannot sit and review over it. "We cannot say death warrant cannot be implemented because divorce plea of Akshay's wife is pending," the bench said.
 Three of the four death row convicts, Akshay, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma moved the high court in the evening challenging the trial court order declining to stay their execution. They, along with Mukesh Singh, are scheduled to be hanged at 5.30 am on Friday.

The American economy has perhaps four to six weeks before retail shutdowns, millions working from home, and quarantines initiate a severe recession. Even a week is costly, to workers and to employers, many with only a thin cushion of capital on which to rely when revenues fall short. The longer today’s pressures last, the more likely it is that they will force layoffs and other more lasting cutbacks by businesses, many of which will face bankruptcy. Recent monetary easing might help contain the severity of the coming recession, as might fiscal-stimulus measures, such as the contemplated payroll tax cut. Washington and the states have an opportunity to do more by targeting the way today’s emergency measures would create recessionary conditions.

ROCHESTER — In response to a shortage of testing supplies nationwide, Minnesota earlier this week said it would prioritize hospitalized patients, health care workers and those living or working in places like nursing homes and long-term care facilities for COVID-19 testing.
 The move — and shortage of testing supplies overall — creates immense challenges for public health officials as they work to understand how widespread the virus is in Minnesota — and try to prevent its spread.
 “In an ideal world, that’s why we would like to see more testing. It does give us more information about the spread, more data to understand what’s happening,” said Bonnie Brueshoff, public health director for Dakota County, where seven positive cases have been identified.
 “But meanwhile, the reality we are living in is that testing has to be limited because there’s not enough.”
 Nationally, public health experts say the United States has been ill-prepared to manage a pandemic of this magnitude. That’s included planning for and stockpiling materials needed to do widespread testing, including reagents and other materials used to take and process samples. Meanwhile, demand for these products is widespread across the globe, putting pressure on the supply.
 In the early days of the virus’ spread in Minnesota, the state Health Department was doing the bulk of the COVID-19 testing, with kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospitals would take nose and throat swabs from patients, and send samples to the state.
 But with a shortage of tests and testing materials, health care providers are forced to focus on highest-priority patients.
 The Health Department said Tuesday that all other patients — those who have a fever, cough, shortness of breath and other symptoms associated with a possible COVID-19 infection — should self-quarantine and isolate themselves from others, even family, as much as possible.
 Gov. Tim Walz and several governors around the country have put pressure on the federal government for more testing supplies, which have been strained by worldwide demand. But in the meantime, Brueshoff said that prioritizing certain patients makes sense.
 “We understand when you have a limited ability to test, there has to be prioritization done,” she said. She added that her department is simultaneously stressing the need for people to stay home if they’re sick, and wash their hands often.
 Health officials for weeks have been increasingly raising the alarm over the spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. The disease is transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs and sneezes, similar to the way the flu can spread.
 Government and medical leaders are urging people to wash their hands frequently and well, refrain from touching their faces, cover their coughs, disinfect surfaces and avoid large crowds — all in an effort to curb the virus’ rapid spread.
 The state of Minnesota has temporarily closed schools, while administrators work to determine next steps, and is requiring a temporary closure of all in- person dining at restaurants, bars and coffee shops, as well as theaters, gyms, yoga studios and other spaces in which people congregate in close proximity.
 Shortage of testing supplies limits big picture look at virus
 In Olmsted County, Public Health Director Graham Briggs said an inadequate amount of testing supplies has made it hard to stay ahead of the virus.
 “The reason we want to do this testing is for public health surveillance,” said Briggs. “The reason we do that is not to inform the doctor how to treat you — it’s to inform the public health system about where this infection is, or where those who are infected are, where it’s transmitting and how much we’re seeing in the community.”
 Briggs said he’s concerned about the backlog of at least 1,700 samples at the Health Department that haven’t been tested yet because the state lacks the supplies it needs to test them.
 “The longer it takes to get that testing done, those positives are people who potentially have this virus we’re not able to follow-up on,” Briggs said. “Right now, testing is very important to get ahead of this.”
 The situation also raises questions about equity, Briggs said, because an added benefit of what public health officials call “surveillance testing” — monitoring the situation broadly — is that people who don’t have insurance or who are undocumented have easier access to getting tested for the virus.
 To fill the gap, the state is asking hospitals to send lower-priority samples to commercial labs.
 State officials say that’s one way providers can ease the pressure on the limited resources it has to test samples. Hospitals in Minnesota are using commercial laboratories like Mayo Clinic and Quest Diagnostics to conduct that testing.
 Essentia Health in Duluth will be contracting with Mayo Clinic to test samples, said infectious disease specialist Dr. Rajesh Prabhu.
 But Prabhu said Essentia will continue to follow state guidance on who they test.
 “We’re trying to conserve those resources for the public good,” he said.“People have the question: ‘Are we going to miss cases in the community if we don’t do more testing?’ But what we’re concerned about is actually having a severe case of COVID-19.”
 Essentia, along with other large provider networks across the state, including Sanford and CentraCare, say they will see and test anyone who needs testing regardless of whether they have insurance or can pay for those procedures out of pocket.
 A new federal law also requires that testing be free.
 “We will not let [cost] be a barrier to getting testing,” Mayo Clinic Laboratories president Dr. Bill Morice. “We will make sure that people who need the test can get it.”
 Since last week, Mayo has run 800 tests and found 16 positive results. Starting today, Morice said the labs can run up to 3,000 tests daily, and has expanded its testing agreements to eight major health systems around the state.
 One reason Mayo has been able to ramp up testing is because its test is different — and uses different supplies and procedures — than the test kits provided to the state by the CDC, Morice said.
 Morice said that allows providers a bit more latitude in who they test, but he said Mayo and the other hospitals it is working with will continue to be judicious in their approach.

Easy loans to small businesses would certainly help. Since small businesses have the thinnest capital cushion on which to draw for operating expenses when revenues fall short, they will likely start the layoffs that lead to recession. If the Small Business Administration (SBA) were equipped to make low-interest or zero-interest loans to help small businesses sustain payrolls and stave off bankruptcy during the present pause, it could delay or stop the slide into recession. Under standard disaster relief, the SBA has made provisions for loans of up to $2 million, but this disaster is different from others and will require larger amounts, extended over longer terms. States and cities could bolster such an effort with similar programs of their own. Washington should change the rules to allow states and cities to raise money with tax-free bonds for this purpose.

Bordogna singled out the support and training the organization gives to mentors. “Mentoring is a challenging thing. You think about the kids putting themselves out there, but sometimes we forget that it is just as hard for the adults to put themselves out and build a relationship with the youth. It’s been neat to see how much Kathleen really supports the mentors.”
 Like everyone else, Bordogna said she is looking ahead to a time when the pandemic hopefully eases so that she can focus further on advancing One to One Mentoring’s goals for Norwood and the West End.
 “I am really excited to get to work with the Norwood community and the West End,” she said. “It’s been great to be in the schools and get to know the teachers and some of the families that way.

 Bordogna described an upcoming project in partnership with the Norwood Community Garden and the local food bank.
 “The food bank has a plot at the community garden and One to One is going to partner with them to help take care of that plot and support growing food for the food bank,” she said. “It’s a great way for mentors and mentees to have a consistent activity if they want it. I think it will be a great way for us to recruit additional mentors and get the word out about what One to One Mentoring is all about. It’s definitely something I am excited about in Norwood.”
