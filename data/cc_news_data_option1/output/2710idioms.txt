On a 16-shot exchange, Djokovic delivered an overhead that was retrieved, then tried a drop shot that Murray got back. Djokovic put the ball in the net, and Murray was at match point No. 4. When that one went Murray’s way, the ball on Djokovic’s side of the court, Murray dropped his neon-red racket, yanked his white hat off and pumped both fists overhead, screaming, “Yes! Yes!” He was looking directly at the corner of the stadium with benches for members of the press, a group that he used to worry helped fuel the intense pressure and only-one-way-to-satisfy-them expectations on Murray’s shoulders.

In that election, independent expenditures topped $70 million, with the vast bulk of it going toward advertising. The totals spent in opposition to the candidates outweighed spending in support of either of them by more than three to one.
 For the first time in a Colorado Senate election — the first mid-term after Supreme Court rulings had given the green light to unlimited spending in federal elections by outside groups — the outside spending positively swamped what the candidates spent, though they certainly pulled their weight, with Udall shelling out about $20 million and Gardner spending about $12 million. (In the previous Senate race, in 2010, outside spending totaled about $35 million, and the two nominees spent about $18 million, including the costs of protracted, hard-fought primaries.)
 The biggest spenders in 2014 were the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which spent nearly $10 million to trash Gardner and around $650,000 to make Udall look good, followed by Republican-aligned Crossroads GPS, which spent its entire $8.6 million budget in Colorado going afer Udall.
 NextGen Climate — billionaire Tom Steyer's organization — spent $7 million soiling Gardner and about $400,000 supporting Udall. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent $6 million against Udall and just $300,000 boosting Gardner, while the national Democrats' Senate Majority PAC dumped $5 million into negative ads aimed at Gardner and $900,000 on positive ads about Udall.

Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh) [India], July 10 (ANI): A petition seeking a CBI enquiry in the encounter of history-sheeter Vikas Dubey by the Special Task Force (STF) Uttar Pradesh was filed in the Allahabad High Court on Friday by Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Abhishek Som.   The petitioner has sought "direction to the respondents to lodge first information report against responsible police persons and conduct the investigation of the matter to some Independent   Agency or to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for a fair and impartial investigation."   The petition raised questions on the manner in which the encounter was carried out, terming it a 'fake encounter' and said that the Supreme Court has held that "fake encounter is like cold-blooded murder."   It further accused the police department of having made a "false and fabricated story for saving police officers."   Earlier, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had also demanded a probe by a sitting Supreme Court judge in the entire Kanpur encounter case. She further slammed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stating that the latter has turned Uttar Pradesh into "Apradh Pradesh" and criminals like Vikas Dubey are being "shielded by people in power".   Kanpur encounter case main accused Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter with the police on Friday.   Dubey, the main accused in the Kanpur encounter case was arrested by the police in Ujjain on Thursday morning. He was on the run for the last several days and had come to Ujjain to offer prayers at Temple, where he was identified by a security guard at the shrine.   The gangster is the main accused in the encounter that took place in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur last week, in which a group of assailants allegedly opened fire on a police team, which had gone to arrest Dubey. Eight police personnel were killed in the encounter.   Dubey managed to escape and the Uttar Pradesh police launched a hunt and raised the bounty on him to Rs 5 lakh. (ANI)

Without Becker, Roma’s 2017/18 season would not have gone as successfully as it did. That season in the Champions League, Roma was relatively poor away from home, heavily relying on a strong defensive performance and heroics from Becker to keep clean sheets at the Stadio Olimpico against the likes of Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Shakhtar Donetsk, Barcelona and several others. In fact, until the semifinals against Liverpool, Roma conceded zero goals at home in the Champions League. But without Becker, the net would not have been so impervious, and Roma would most likely have been eliminated in the group stage.

Jane M. Bunge East Lansing - July 5, 1923 - July 4, 2020 Jane Mary (Przybylski) Bunge passed away on July 4, 2020 hours shy of her 97th birthday. Jane was born in Detroit, MI on July 5, 1923 to John and Mary (Jara) Przybylski. Jane is survived by her children Susan Waltersdorf, Luke (Mary) Bunge, Harold (Kathy) Bunge and John (Cyndi Nelson) Bunge and numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren as well as many nieces and nephews. She is predeceased by her husband Richard, her parents, siblings Helen and Edward, and son-in-law Leigh Waltersdorf. After completing a bachelor's degree in Chemistry at University of Detroit Mercy, Jane began work as a chemist at Parke-Davis in Detroit, where she met her husband Richard (Dick). Dick and Jane were married on May 29, 1954. Jane initially was a stay at-home mom, but when all children were in school, she returned to school and completed a master's degree in Guidance Counseling from Wayne State University. She subsequently began her second professional career as an advisor at Wayne State University in the College of Liberal Arts. Jane retired from WSU in 1984. Dick and Jane began their married lives together in St Clair Shores, moved to Mt Clemens, then to Ann Arbor. After building a geodesic dome home in the Canadian Lakes Community in Mecosta County, MI, a proud achievement, they moved there in 1986. Jane was a life-long gardener and was active in gardening clubs, including volunteering as a docent at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens in Ann Arbor, but in retirement discovered her true passion of rock and wildflower gardening. Jane secured seeds from all over the country, tended hundreds of little pots in a make-shift greenhouse and patiently waited (sometimes multiple years) for germination. Jane was also actively involved in church activities and bible study groups, continuously pursuing a deeper understanding of Christian theology and history. She was a voracious reader, active in book clubs and was always interested in current events. Jane always had a curious mind and believed strongly in growing and learning at every age. Even in her last days of life she asked her children to read periodical articles to her so that she could stay abreast of what was going on in the world. Jane often clipped articles and shared them with her family and friends urging deep, broadened thinking. One of her good friends recently commented that "Jane was an inspiration, challenging those of us in her caring to be more than we might have thought we could be". Her children reflected on this comment and understood even more clearly what Jane had been doing all of these years. In 2004 Dick and Jane recognized that their health was becoming more challenged, particularly that Jane's macular degeneration had advanced, and therefore a move closer to children was necessary. This resulted in a move to the East Lansing Burcham Hills community where they quickly became as involved in church, gardening, theater going, clubs, etc. as ever. Of course, chiefly among their activities was the continuing support of family and grandchildren activities. Due in part to current virus and health concerns, the family plans a small private funeral at St Thomas Aquinas Church at a date to be determined. If you are so moved, in lieu of flowers or other commemoratives, please consider a donation to either St Vincent Catholic Charities (stvcc.org), to the Greater Lansing Food Bank (greaterlansingfoodbank.org), or to the Association for the Blind &amp; Visually Impaired (Michigan) (abvimichigan.org), three of Jane's favored charities. Along with the wonderful support from so many friends, the Bunge family also extends their heartfelt appreciation to Burcham staff as well as other agency staff members for their care and support of Jane in these last months. As Jane would say, "Bless you". Family is being served by Gorsline Runciman Funeral Homes, East Lansing, MI. Fond memories and expressions of sympathy may be shared at www.greastlansing.com for the Bunge Family.

Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh) [India], July 10 (ANI) "The Uttar Pradesh administration has done the right thing by taking action against my son," said an old and feeble Ram Kumar Dubey, father of gangster Vikas Dubey.   The father supported said his son killed eight police officials and it was an unforgivable sin.   "Had he listened to us, his life would not have ended this way. Vikas never helped us in any way. Due to him, even our ancestral property was razed to the ground. He also killed eight policemen, which is an unforgivable sin. The administration has done the right thing. Had they not done so, tomorrow others would have acted similarly," Ram Kumar told ANI here.   "It is the chief minister's duty to protect every individual. The police is an extension of that. He attacked them which cannot be forgiven. I will not even take part in his cremation," he added.   Ram Kumar Dubey said that his only appeal to the government is to allow him entry to his ancestral property now.   Vikas Dubey was cremated at Bhairav Ghat in Kanpur. His wife, younger son and brother-in-law were present and no other member of his family attended the last rites.   Vikas Dubey was arrested by the police in Ujjain on Thursday morning. He was on the run for the last six days and had come to the city to offer prayers at a temple, where he was identified by a security guard.   He was killed in an encounter by the Uttar Pradesh Police earlier today after he "attempted to flee".

Wisconsin’s governor has one of the most powerful vetoes in the country, despite decades of limitations imposed by voters and lawmakers. The mixed results for Evers came a day after the court upheld laws that the Legislature passedduring a lame-duck session to weaken Evers’ powers before he took office. In that ruling, the court also delivered a partial win for Evers, saying the Legislature overstepped its bounds with one lame duck law.

Earlier, in May 2020, Secretary of State Pompeo condemned the ICC, saying it was a “political body, not a judicial institution.” That was in light of the ICC move to investigate Israel for its violations of international law regarding the occupation of the Palestinians. If the ICC proceeds with any such investigation, Pompeo said, the United States will “exact consequences.” This is gangland talk.

For Jim Barnes, the new interim executive director for the Exchange Club Center for Family Unity, his daughters’ exit from Early Childhood Family Education in Owatonna served as a turning point for his interest in educating families.
 While his daughters furthered their education as kindergartners, Barnes realized he, as a parent, wanted more support.
 “Once [children] hit kindergarten, there’s nowhere for parents to really go at that point,” said Barnes. With a laugh, he added, “But the problems don’t go away; they just get bigger.”
 Barnes’ former boss, Brad Haugen, told him about a nonprofit called the Exchange Club Center for Family Unity (ECCFU). Located in Owatonna, ECCFU serves Dodge, Waseca, Rice, Steele and Freeborn counties and provides in-home mentoring, support and resources for parents so they can give their best to their children. The nonprofit organization uses a specific technique, the National Exchange Club Parent Mentor Model, that has been proven to prevent child abuse.
 Haugen served on the board, and eventually, Barnes joined the board as well.
 Another turning point happened for Barnes this year, when former ECCFU Executive Director Annette Duncan resigned from her role and accepted a job as president of Steele County United Way. Needing an interim executive director to step in, the board asked Barnes to fill the vacancy for the time being.
 “He’s serving in the role, and he’s done a great job so far,” said Haugen. “… He’s excited about it, too, which is good to have someone looking at it as an opportunity … It’s good for us and good for him, for now, and we’ll see where it goes long term.”
 Barnes has a degrees in accounting and business finance as well as experience with nonprofits. He’s also served on the school boards for CHOICE Technical Academy in Owatonna and DREAM Technical Academy in Willmar for the past four years.
 As a board member for ECCFU, Barnes has been involved in some decision making and the organization’s transition into a new building. He’s helped with fundraising through the nonprofit’s annual golf tournament at the Owatonna Country Club and others.
 Barnes said one of his goals with ECCFU is to simply “keep it going.” Duncan, he said, was such a driving force behind ECCFU that her departure was unexpected. He aims to provide stability, secure more funding and grants, and recruit parent mentors for a new cohort to begin later this month — as well as parents who want to be mentored.
 Those interested in being parent mentors need to complete background checks and have a desire to help others. Grandparents can be mentors, said Barnes, or anyone with experience with children. Mentors undergo a 10-week training so ECCFU can pair them with a family that may need help. One mentor/mentee 10-week session concludes next week, and the next will start later this month if the need is there.
 Other ECCFU offerings, like parent support groups, are Tuesdays from 6 to 7:30 p.m. via online portal. Similar to ECFE, Barnes said these sessions are designed for parents of teenagers, and staff member Ann Gettis offers tips and strategies for parents to connect with their teens. Anyone from the five- county area may participate in these groups.
 “I really support what the organization is trying to do in the counties of southern Minnesota,” said Barnes. “I’m very appreciative to the board for giving me this opportunity to be the interim director.”

Luckily for the Brazilian national team, they were blessed with two world- class keepers in both Becker and Ederson. If Becker had been out of the picture, Ederson, who is stylistically very similar, would fill his gap. Brazil’s 2018 World Cup run and 2019 Copa America victory would have occurred without change.

Jane M. Bunge      East Lansing - July 5, 1923 - July 4, 2020      Jane Mary (Przybylski) Bunge passed away on July 4, 2020 hours shy of her 97th birthday. Jane was born in Detroit, MI on July 5, 1923 to John and Mary (Jara) Przybylski.      Jane is survived by her children Susan Waltersdorf, Luke (Mary) Bunge, Harold (Kathy) Bunge and John (Cyndi Nelson) Bunge and numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren as well as many nieces and nephews. She is predeceased by her husband Richard, her parents, siblings Helen and Edward, and son-in-law Leigh Waltersdorf.      After completing a bachelor's degree in Chemistry at University of Detroit Mercy, Jane began work as a chemist at Parke-Davis in Detroit, where she met her husband Richard (Dick). Dick and Jane were married on May 29, 1954. Jane initially was a stay at-home mom, but when all children were in school, she returned to school and completed a master's degree in Guidance Counseling from Wayne State University. She subsequently began her second professional career as an advisor at Wayne State University in the College of Liberal Arts. Jane retired from WSU in 1984.      Dick and Jane began their married lives together in St Clair Shores, moved to Mt Clemens, then to Ann Arbor. After building a geodesic dome home in the Canadian Lakes Community in Mecosta County, MI, a proud achievement, they moved there in 1986.      Jane was a life-long gardener and was active in gardening clubs, including volunteering as a docent at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens in Ann Arbor, but in retirement discovered her true passion of rock and wildflower gardening. Jane secured seeds from all over the country, tended hundreds of little pots in a make-shift greenhouse and patiently waited (sometimes multiple years) for germination.      Jane was also actively involved in church activities and bible study groups, continuously pursuing a deeper understanding of Christian theology and history. She was a voracious reader, active in book clubs and was always interested in current events. Jane always had a curious mind and believed strongly in growing and learning at every age. Even in her last days of life she asked her children to read periodical articles to her so that she could stay abreast of what was going on in the world. Jane often clipped articles and shared them with her family and friends urging deep, broadened thinking. One of her good friends recently commented that "Jane was an inspiration, challenging those of us in her caring to be more than we might have thought we could be". Her children reflected on this comment and understood even more clearly what Jane had been doing all of these years.      In 2004 Dick and Jane recognized that their health was becoming more challenged, particularly that Jane's macular degeneration had advanced, and therefore a move closer to children was necessary. This resulted in a move to the East Lansing Burcham Hills community where they quickly became as involved in church, gardening, theater going, clubs, etc. as ever. Of course, chiefly among their activities was the continuing support of family and grandchildren activities.      Due in part to current virus and health concerns, the family plans a small private funeral at St Thomas Aquinas Church at a date to be determined. If you are so moved, in lieu of flowers or other commemoratives, please consider a donation to either St Vincent Catholic Charities (stvcc.org), to the Greater Lansing Food Bank (greaterlansingfoodbank.org), or to the Association for the Blind & Visually Impaired (Michigan) (abvimichigan.org), three of Jane's favored charities.      Along with the wonderful support from so many friends, the Bunge family also extends their heartfelt appreciation to Burcham staff as well as other agency staff members for their care and support of Jane in these last months. As Jane would say, "Bless you".      Family is being served by Gorsline Runciman Funeral Homes, East Lansing, MI. Fond memories and expressions of sympathy may be shared at www.greastlansing.com for the Bunge Family.
