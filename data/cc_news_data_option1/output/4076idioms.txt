MUMBAI — Namit Das has been full of surprises this year, like his work in "Aarya" and other films and shows. In line with his endeavor to explore varied genres, he signed ZEE Studios' "Aafat-E-Ishq," based on the award-winning Hungarian film "Liza - The Fox Fairy." The actor has wrapped its schedule and is excited about the film's streaming.
 The versatile performer took to his social media to share, “With all its challenges as our first project in four months for all the obvious reasons, I think we have something very special to look forward to here. And as I always say, it’s never the destination but it’s always about the people with whom we share this journey. It’s because of them that you might want to relive this journey. But I don’t want to spill the beans.. this is just half of what we have achieved."
 The Zee Studios production is directed by Indrajit Nattoji and has an ensemble cast that includes Ila Arun, Amit Sial, Vikram Kochhar and Deepak Dobriyal along with Neha Sharma. This venture goes down as Das' first big film following the lockdown. "Aafat-E-Ishq" is set to stream on ZEE5 later this year. Currently, the actor awaits the streaming of Mira Nair's "A Suitable Boy."

Eminent Indian-origin academician Srikant Datar has been named as Dean of Harvard Business School, succeeding Nitin Nohria and becoming the second consecutive dean hailing from India to lead the prestigious 112-year- old institution. Datar, an alumnus of University of Bombay and Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, is the Arthur Lowes Dickinson Professor of Business Administration and the senior associate dean for University Affairs at Harvard Business School (HBS). He will assume charge as the school's next dean on January 1, President Larry Bacow said. Bacow described Datar as an innovative educator, a distinguished scholar, and a deeply experienced academic leader. He is a leading thinker about the future of business education, and he has recently played an essential role in HBS's creative response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He has served with distinction in a range of leadership positions over his nearly 25 years at HBS, while also forging novel collaborations with other Harvard Schools, Bacow said. Datar said he is in equal measures humbled and honoured to take on the new role. Harvard Business School is an institution with a remarkable legacy of impact in research, education, and practice. Yet the events of the past year have hastened our passage to an unforeseen future, he said, adding that he looks forward to working with colleagues and friends of the school to realise our mission in what undoubtedly will be an exciting new era. Datar will become the 11th dean in the business school history. He will succeed Nohria, who last November announced his plans to conclude his deanship at the end of June 2020, after 10 years of service. Nohria had agreed to continue through this December in view of the pandemic, a statement posted on the Harvard Gazette website said. Datar received his bachelor's degree, with distinction, from the University of Bombay in 1973. A chartered accountant, he went on to receive a postgraduate diploma in business management from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, before completing master's degrees in statistics and economics and a Ph.D. in business from Stanford University. From 1984 to 1989, he was an assistant professor and then associate professor at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration, where he was honoured with the George Leland Bach Teaching Award. From 1989 to 1996, he served on the faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he rose to become the Littlefield Professor of Accounting and Management and was recognised with the school's Distinguished Teaching Award. The statement added that as a native of India who has travelled widely on the HBS's behalf, Datar brings a broad international perspective to his work. He has presented his research to audiences of academics and executives in North America, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. He has led discussions and workshops on management education on several continents, has written numerous papers and cases focused on enterprises based abroad, and is faculty co-chair of the HBS Senior Executive Program-Africa, which was launched in 2016 and has since offered programs for executives in South Africa, Rwanda, Ghana, and Mauritius. He also serves on the governing body of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta. The statement said that since joining the HBS faculty in 1996, Datar has held a series of key positions, as the school's senior associate dean responsible for faculty recruiting, for faculty development, for executive education, for research, and currently for University affairs. He has served since 2015 as faculty chair of the Harvard Innovation Labs, or i-lab. Most recently, he has been intensively engaged in envisioning and implementing the innovative hybrid teaching and learning model that HBS has adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement said. Bacow added that Datar will come to the deanship with a broad international perspective, decades of close engagement with business practice, and a strong commitment to building an increasingly diverse and inclusive HBS community. He is also a warm, generous, and thoughtful colleague and mentor - someone whose leadership experience, intimate knowledge of HBS, deep devotion to the institution, and talent for catalysing constructive change all promise to serve the School and the University well, at a pivotal moment for business education. Nohria said Datar is an outstanding choice as Harvard Business School's next dean and he has thought deeply about the challenges and opportunities facing management education, and has a proven record of collaboration, innovation, and leadership - not only within HBS, but across Harvard and at other organisations. Co-author of several books, Datar played a key role in launching both the M.S.-M.B.A. in biotechnology and life sciences (with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School) and the M.S.-M.B.A. in engineering sciences (with the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) joint degree programs. Datar currently serves on the boards of companies such as Novartis and T-Mobile US. Founded in 1908, the Business School is located on a 40-acre campus in Boston. Its faculty of more than 200 offer full-time programs leading to the M.B.A. and doctoral degrees, as well as more than 70 open-enrollment executive-education programs and 55 custom programs, and Harvard Business School Online, the digital-learning platform.

We were sitting at our kitchen table Aug. 6 having breakfast when we caught a fleeting glance out our window of a bird with a bright red head contrasting with a black back, white underparts and secondary wing feathers flying across our lawn to a dead larch tree at the end of our yard. I picked up the binoculars, always ready for use, to see what kind of bird it was and, sure enough, it was a red-headed woodpecker. Although I had seen them many times in southern Wisconsin, especially in dead trees found along the Wisconsin River bottoms and in mature woodlots with dead trees, it was the first time we had seen one at our Nature Education Center here in Fifield. The plumage of both sexes is identical.
 I was eager to document the sighting with my camera, but I had to shoot into the sun, so the first pictures were poor, but I wanted to get some before the bird left. Fortunately for us, the bird remained most of the morning. It was so intent on feeding that I was able to sneak up on it using vegetation as a shield and I was able to take some photos in better light.
 It acted like a flycatcher. It would fly up in the air to catch insects like our Eastern phoebes do and return to the dead larch numerous times to eat its quarry. Sometimes it would even fly to the ground to snatch up insects like Eastern bluebirds do and then return to the dead tree to eat them. Normally, most woodpeckers peck at dead trees in search of insect food, but this one did that only occasionally while we watched it finding it more lucrative to catch insects in the air and on the ground.
 Since that event, Larry Gregg reported that he spotted an adult red-headed woodpecker at his feeder in Park Falls on May 25, a first for his yard too. During the week of Sept. 27, Mike and Becky Riel, who live along the South Fork Flambeau River in Fifield, reported a strange looking bird coming to their feeder. I rushed down to their home and found a juvenile red-headed woodpecker was enjoying sunflower seeds on their deck feeder and had been coming for several days off and on. So, to have three sightings of this uncommon woodpecker in our area was a welcome treat, so I thought I would tell you more about this interesting woodpecker.
 The red-headed woodpecker isn’t just any ordinary woodpecker. It has a voracious appetite; almost anything is fair game for this active woodpecker. This omnivorous woodpecker forages in trees and on the ground, feeding on anything from small birds, bird eggs and mice to insects, fruits and seeds. They can be readily attracted to bird feeders with whole corn kernels and sunflower seeds. Its wide range of prey includes earthworms, crickets and wasps. After pecking away at dead tree bark, the bird uses its long, barbed tongue to extract insects, including beetle larvae. For larger animal prey, such as mice, the bird pounces on its victim and pecks it with its bill. Besides nuts and acorns, the woodpecker stores in shallow tree cavities for winter use, the bird also caches various fruits, including grapes, cherries, and apples.
 Red-headed woodpeckers are not as common in northern Wisconsin as they are in central and southern Wisconsin where they are a common migrant and resident. Northern populations will migrate south from August to November and return north in March. During short-distance migrations, red-headed woodpeckers color the sky with a spectacular display of crimson as they travel in flocks of several hundred birds. They also display a unique bobbing style of flight in which birds appear to rise and fall several times.
 Breeding bird surveys, including those in Wisconsin, show the species is declining throughout its range due to the loss of its favorite woodland habitats and dead trees. With a preference for open country where dead trees and snags are plentiful, the red-headed woodpecker frequents mature lowland forests with plenty of dead trees for nesting with some open undergrowth. Other types of habitats include various types of wooded savannas, open woodland, pine forests, villages, suburbs, orchards, and agricultural lands.
 The red-headed woodpecker benefited from chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease outbreaks of the twentieth century. Though these diseases devastated host trees, they provided many nest sites and foraging opportunities for the woodpeckers in the resulting dead trees.
 During the breeding season, starting in May in Wisconsin, the male red-headed woodpecker will excavate the nesting site, a cavity 8-24 inches deep in a dead tree, but will also use nest holes in artificial structures such as utility poles, fence posts and buildings as long as the nest hole is 1.75 inches in diameter. Drumming is part of the courtship activity and pairs will often perform mutual tapping with one bird inside the hole of the tree and the other tapping by the entrance hole.
 The male is monogamous. The female will lay four to seven white, glossy eggs on a layer of fine woodchips, and both sexes will incubate the eggs for 11-13 days. Both parents will feed and care for the hatchlings until they are ready to leave the nest after about 30 days. If the eggs are taken or destroyed, the persistent pair will produce more and sometimes even raise a second brood. One persistent female laid 32 eggs in a season before successfully raising a brood! Juveniles have a brown head, a dingy belly, and a blackish, brown back like the one Riels reported in Fifield.
 Red-headed woodpeckers can live as long as 10 years and are protected by the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
 Correction:Last week’s column on the Round Lake Logging Dam said the Doering family purchased the dam and land in the early 1990s. The land was actually purchased in 1902.

  # Delta downgraded to depression after battering Louisiana


  By REBECCA SANTANA, STACEY PLAISANCE and ALANNA DURKIN RICHER


  Associated Press |


  Oct 10, 2020  at 2:15 PM


  Ripping tarps off damaged roofs and scattering massive piles of storm debris in the wind and water, Hurricane Delta inflicted fresh damage in Louisiana along the same path of destruction Hurricane Laura carved just six weeks earlier.


  Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane with top winds of 100 mph before rapidly weakening over land on Saturday. Flash floods remained a risk from parts of Texas to Mississippi, where forecasters said up to 10 inches of rain could fall by day’s end. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said that the storm had weakened to a tropical depression by mid-morning Saturday, with maximum sustained winds clocked at 35 mph.

Valtteri Bottas claimed an impressive pole position for the Eifel Formula One Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes teammate and championship leader Lewis Hamilton on Saturday.
 German fans saw Sebastian Vettel have to settle for 11th while Nico Hulkenberg will be last on Sunday's grid for Racing Point after standing in at short notice for Lance Stroll.
 Bottas topped practice and was also on form in qualifying, storming to his third pole of the season and 14th overall by clocking 1 minute 25.269 seconds in cold temperatures.
 Hamilton was .256 seconds adrift and Red Bull's Max Verstappen trailed by .293 in third as he failed to end Mercedes' perfect run of season poles.
 "It's such a nice feeling when you get it on the last lap, with the last chance," Bottas said. "The last lap in Q3 was spot on, just what I needed. It's been pretty tricky with short practice and these conditions   getting the tyres in the sweet spot."
