The shooting of two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in an apparent ambush prompted a manhunt, reaction from the president, and protests outside the hospital where the 31-year-old female deputy and 24-year-old male deputy both underwent surgery Saturday evening, reports the AP. The deputies were shot while sitting in their patrol car at a Metro station and were able to radio for help, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a late-night news conference. Villanueva, whose department has come under fire during recent protests over racial unrest, expressed frustration over anti-police sentiment as he urged people to pray for the officers. "It pisses me off. It dismays me at the same time," he said. The department shared video showing a person open fire through the passenger window of the patrol car. "The gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without ... provocation," the department said.

Una volta tornato a terra ferma, l'uomo racconta ad un dottore l'esperienza vissuta e soprattutto la presenza di una creatura dalle dimensioni spropositate. Il dottore non crede alla veridicità del racconto ed anzi evidenzia la possibilità che il sub possa essere stato esposto troppo a lungo ad una pressione eccessiva, per cui affetto da psicosi. 5 anni più tardi da questo episodio, una nuova missione di natura scientifica sta per esplorare la profonda Fossa delle Marianne.
