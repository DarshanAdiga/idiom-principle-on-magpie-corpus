While most of the characters on Gossip Girl could probably use some advice from "Dr. Drew" Pinsky, he is actually heading to another part of the CW's schedule.
 The network is set to air a new daily-half hour show, Dr. Drew's Lifechangers, beginning this fall.
 The CW will air two episodes of the new show back to back from 3-4, with an original episode running in the first half hour.
 The show was developed from the nationally syndicated newsmagazine Extra and will be produced in Los Angeles by Warner Bros.' Telepictures Productions. It was created by Lisa Gregorisch-Dempsey, Senior Executive Producer of Extra, who will serve as an Executive Producer of the new series. Pinsky will also be an executive producer, along with another EP who is yet to be hired.
 The new show continues a hot streak for Pinsky, who just met with television critics last week in Pasadena to talk up Dr. Drew Pinsky, his new HLN show premiering this spring. But Gregorisch-Dempsey says while the HLN show (which is not produced by Telepictures, though HLN is also in the Time Warner family) looks to be more focused on breaking news of the day, the CW daytime show will have a more of a daytime feel with a self-help target.
 "This is a more daytime focused show about personal transformation and real people stories," she says. "We feel Drew is the answer man and this is the answer show. It will be a search engine for your life."
 The show will feature stories about people in conflict, anything from relationship troubles to addiction, and Pinsky - who is board certified in internal and addiction medicine - will bring in experts to help the subjects. The panelists will range from celebrities to medical experts.
 "We are not doing exploitation TV, or over the top TV," says Hilary Estey McLoughlin, President of Telepictures Productions. "Drew truly wants to help people with this show."
 The show will tape every week to give it a topical feel, according to Hilary Estey McLoughlin, President of Telepictures Productions. For instance, she says a show airing this week could have a doctor talking about recovering from serious injuries in the wake of the shooting in Arizona.
 "It will have kind of a hybrid feel with a mix of tape and studio," she says. "Drew has an amazing array of knowledge and experience working with real people as well as celebrities, so we feel it's a great combination."
 Other plans for the show include panelists taking questions from a studio audience and from viewers via video chat, as well as testing the latest self- improvement products such as beauty, anti-aging, fitness and diet products.
 Pinsky has already been a mainstay on cable television in recent years, with several buzz-inducing shows on VH1 including Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew, Sober House and Sex Rehab With Dr. Drew. Pinsky has also been a staple on the radio waves through a long-running syndicated show, Loveline.
 The CW currently airs repeats of Tyra Banks' talk show, which is no longer in production, in the 3 p.m. timeslot.

MORE AUSTRALIANS BACK IN SCHOOL: Students in two more Australian states returned to school full-time as numbers of COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the country fall. New South Wales and Queensland states joined the less populous Western Australia and South Australia states and the Northern Territory in resuming face-to-face learning instead of studying from home online. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said students and teachers should stay home if they are sick, noting “We’re not out of the woods yet." New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said school absences appeared to be higher than normal. Australia's remaining jurisdictions plan to send students back to school in stages through early June.

UPDATED] Meredith's KCTV Kansas City has partnered with the daily _Kansas City Star_ newspaper to expand content and revenue potential for both media outlets in DMA No. 31. KCTV, a CBS affiliate, is the exclusive provider of weather news to the newspaper, says KCTV VP/General Manager Bobby Totsch.
 "We took the two best news organizations in Kansas City and combined them to give consumers and what we call ‘viewsers' more in-depth coverage of the market," says Totsch. "It gives us the opportunity to go deeper than we normally might on a story."
 McClatchy owns the KC Star.
 Star VP/Editor Mike Fannin said weather is the centerpiece of the partnership --KCTV now provides the forecasts on the paper's weather page, at the rear of the Sports section, as well as on a revamped microsite. But he added that KCTV is a vital newsgathering partner too. He cited a story dominating this week's paper, about corruption in the Kansas City (KS) police force, that both forces worked on together. "It was a pretty hot news story this week, and they were very helpful," said Fannin. "It's a good example right out of the gate."
 The partnership started in earnest this week, with KCTV talking it up on air. It will extend through the year, and likely beyond.
 Totsch said the KC Star's mammoth reach on the Web, including its strong presence in online search (it owns the traffic-grabbing KansasCity.com URL), made the partnership particularly attractive to the broadcaster.
 Totsch said the pact enables KCTV to bring its content to a wider swath of the local population.
 "We're working together to create more news and marketing and revenue opportunities," he said.
 Fannin says it's off to a good start. "We've taken good initial steps," he says, "and we hope to strengthen the parternship down the road."

This month, books by a couple of accomplished novelists who are almost always worth listening to.
 "Redhead by the Side of the Road"
 By Anne Tyler, read by MacLeod Andrews.   Unabridged, 5 hours.   Penguin Random House Audio, $12.99.
 Micah Mortimer lives an unremarkable life in an unremarkable house in Baltimore. An apartment-building super and freelance computer repairman heading into middle age, he has a woman friend -- he won't call a woman in her late 30s his girlfriend -- and grown sisters, and really, no need for anything more.
 He has a day each week for every household chore, a place for everything and everything in its place. When driving, he always uses his turn signal, even in his building's parking lot.
 Then his well-ordered world is disrupted, first by his girlfriend's announcement that she may be evicted from her apartment, and then by the arrival on his doorstep of the teenaged son of an old flame. In Micah's small world, these are seismic upheavals -- but will either of them have the power to shake his foundation?
 Tyler, Pulitzer-Prize winning author of such books as "The Accidental Tourist" and "Breathing Lessons," specializes in well-observed stories populated by people who feel real. Micah feels real enough that you might find yourself talking to him out loud, wondering whether he will ever wise up and do the obvious right thing.
 At just five hours, the story feels slight enough that you also might wish for something bigger. But that's better, I guess, than wondering when a too-long tale will ever end.
 Andrews gives a warm reading that paints Micah in shades of gray and the other characters in more vibrant hues.
 "The Red Lotus"
 By Chris Bohjalian, read by Rebecca Lowman.   Unabridged, 12 hours.   Penguin Random House Audio, $14.99.
 When emergency-room doctor Alexis Remnick agrees to go on a bike trip to Vietnam with her boyfriend, she unknowingly opens the door to extreme danger -- for herself, and for the world.
 Austin Harper, it turns out, is into some very deep stuff. But Alexis hasn't a clue until he disappears while on a solo ride, leaving behind only three energy gels lying in the middle of a road far from any village or town. Her urge to find out what happened, and what springs from that urge, make up the bulk of the story.
 Telling you too much would do this book and you a disservice -- with his usual strong plotting and well-conceived characters, Bohjalian's story unfolds slowly and with terrific pacing. But at this moment of pandemic, I have to give you fair warning that pandemic -- and efforts to stop it -- are inextricably wound up in "The Red Lotus."
 Lowman gives a professional reading that doesn't paint memorable characters but doesn't get in the way.

HENRICO, Va. (WWBT) - A Henrico woman is sharing her story of recovering from COVID-19 after spending 15 days hospitalized but surrounded by people she believes helped heal her more than medicine.Kathy White, 61, was diagnosed with the disease back in March and admitted to the hospital. More than two weeks later, she was sent home to continue with her recovery after taking part in a clinical trial."I can't wait to put dirt in those things," White said as she walked around her garden.You might call White a woman with a green thumb."I don't know if it's going to hold one bag,” she said as she looked at a flower box. “Might need more than one."But to her husband, family, and herself she can now call herself a COVID-19 survivor.“Yeah, we’ve come a long way,” she said.As White stands proudly in her backyard, two months ago she was not able to fathom working in her garden.“When I got up to go to the bathroom, the hallway was foggy,” she said. “It was like I had stood up in an airplane while it was going up in the air. The weight got on my lung, I could hardly breathe, my chest was so heavy.”On March 26, the 61-year-old was admitted to VCU Medical Center after she showed a variety of COVID-19 symptoms including a fever of 105 degrees."It's painful; it's hard when you can't make it from here to there without feeling like you're going to pass out,” White said. “You just can't move."Despite her hospitalization, White was focused on a mission."I'm going to walk out of here,” she said. “I'm not going to die from this. I'm going to be strong."During her stay at VCU, White took part in a clinical trial using Sarilumab, which is a drug approved to treat arthritis and may have anti-inflammatory effects on the lungs of COVID-19 patients.“We hope that by bringing down the inflammation with these drugs will prevent people from having worse disease,” said Dr. Benjamin Van Tassell, a Professor at the VCU School of Pharmacy. “We hope we can keep people alive and out of the hospital and back home. That’s the goal with these studies.”"I was more than happy because they didn't have anything else to try and I needed to heal,” White said. “I needed to be able to come off of oxygen."Today, White is feeling those improvements."I usually couldn't stand this long,” she said. “I could barely stand to wash dishes long; I was always getting short of breath and couldn't talk this long. I know that my lungs have improved."While it's still too early to tell how effective this clinical trial was, White also credits the nurses who cared for her."I loved them so much,” she said. “They were so nice to me. I know if it wasn't for them, I don't know how I would have hung in there."“I still think about Kathy, I remember her and we had so much fun,” said Elizabeth Cox, a nurse who helped care for White. “Over a month later just to know that she felt the same way to want to talk about it and recognize it is why we do what we do.”"I really feel like my healing, they played more of a part in my healing than my medicine,” White said.The healing that allows White to get back to her garden, to lend a healing hand of her own.Copyright 2020 WWBT.

Like the other ships in the harbor, the Nevada was being pounded by enemy aircraft. It had already been hit by one torpedo and two bombs, Nelson wrote in his 2016 book, "Pearl Harbor, from Infamy to Greatness."
 But at 8:18 that morning, about 20 minutes after the attack began, the Nevada got underway with no senior officers on board.
 "How could the ship move?" Steward 1st Class Ben Holt remembered. "It took hours to get up enough steam to get the ship to go. And this ship was moving! All of us were just kind of, 'Hallelujah!'"

CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Brad Keselowski has won the Southern 500, the Bristol night race, the Brickyard 400 and has now crossed the Coca-Cola 600 off his checklist of crown jewel victories.
 Chase Elliott lost two races in four days, both in heartbreaking fashion.
 Jimmie Johnson had a shot at snapping his three-year losing streak but instead it was extended to 102 consecutive races when Keselowski beat him in overtime early Monday at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Then his car failed inspection and his runner-up finish was thrown out by NASCAR.
 All that action was over the final seven laps of the longest race in NASCAR history.
 Elliott was cruising toward victory with two laps remaining in the 600 when a caution sent the race to overtime. The five additional laps — another 7.5 miles — pushed the longest event on the NASCAR calendar into a true Memorial Day finale.
 A rewind of what happened at Charlotte Motor Speedway:
 ELLIOTT'S BAD BREAKS
 Elliott was trying to win at Darlington Raceway last Wednesday night when he was wrecked by Kyle Busch in what turned out to be the final lap of racing in a rain-shortened event. He showed his displeasure by flipping Busch the bird.

El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, respondió este lunes a las críticas mediáticas de las que fue blanco por ir a jugar al golf el fin de semana, en momentos en que el número de muertes por la covid-19 se acerca a 100.000 en EEUU.
 "¡Las Noticias Falsas y Totalmente Corruptas hacen que suene como un pecado mortal!", dijo en su cuenta de Twitter el mandatario, amante del golf, quien destacó que el juego que disputó en su cancha de Virginia fue el primero desde marzo.
 El momento específico de su salida, a medida que la nación norteamericana se acercaba a un récord en el número de muertes por la pandemia, provocó críticas generalizadas en los medios. Algunos comentaristas recordaron incluso ataques de Trump contra su predecesor Barack Obama por jugar golf durante el brote de ébola de 2014.
 "Hay momentos para jugar y momentos en los que no puedes jugar. Envía la señal equivocada", dijo Trump entonces.
 "Sabes que cuando eres presidente, dices, como, 'Voy a renunciar por un par de años y realmente me voy a concentrar en el trabajo'", dijo en 2014.
 Después de los embates el fin de semana, Trump criticó a los medios por estar "enfermos de odio y deshonestidad".
 "¡Sabía que esto pasaría!", dijo. "Lo que no dicen es que fue mi primer juego de golf en casi 3 meses y, si esperaba tres años, harían sus habituales piezas 'castigadoras' de todos modos", enfatizó.
 El líder republicano agregó que en 2014 Obama voló a su estado natal de Hawái poco después de haber denunciado públicamente la decapitación del rehén estadounidense James Foley por militantes del grupo Estado Islámico (EI).
 Obama se disculpó por la visita mal planificada, y reconoció la gravedad de la decisión en ese momento.
 El antiguo asesor de Obama David Axelrod escribió en su cuenta de Twitter: "No suelo defender a este @POTUS (presidente de EEUU), pero no le envidio una ronda de golf", dijo el ahora analista político.
 "¡Además, nos da al resto un respiro de esos locos tuits! Sí, es hipócrita que @realDonaldTrump haya atacado a @BarackObama para buscar alivio de las presiones de la presidencia en el campo de golf, cuando Trump ha tenido muchas rondas más", señaló.
 "También es hipócrita atacar a Trump por eso ahora si defendiste a Obama entonces", subrayó.

Ocean Infinity said the ship had been working commercial projects in the Pacific since early this year and because of the pandemic had stayed at sea. "They said, 'Let's just go do this,'" Delgado said.
 "We drew a box that was 10 by 10 miles and said 'that's where to go,'" he said. The Pacific Constructor went to the site and searched with underwater robots. Delgado, based in Jacksonville, Florida, followed along from his computer and provided historical and archaeological guidance.
 "Nobody got paid for this," he said. "We all did this because we felt it was the right thing to do at this time."
 The Nevada, built in Quincy, Massachusetts, and launched in 1914, had 36 painted on its bow and stern. It had guarded convoys during World War I, lost several crewmen to the 1918 flu pandemic, and helped escort the ship carrying President Woodrow Wilson to France to negotiate the Treaty of Versailles.
 On the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the Nevada was moored by itself at the end of a line of ships tied up two-by-two at Ford Island in the middle of Pearl Harbor.
 The enemy arrived as the Nevada band played, and the six Patten brothers - Gilbert, Marvin, Bick, Allen, Ray and Bruce, all from Odebolt, Iowa - were stationed in the engine room, according to historian Craig Nelson. They were talking about who would win the coming 1942 Rose Bowl, Duke or Oregon State, when the ship started to shake, as if in an earthquake.

The forecast given by the 45th Weather Squadron forecast talks about a tropical wave moving through Florida on Memorial Day. Here is what that looked like (1st Image). Simply put it is a disorganized mass of showers and storms that are sitting over the Space Coast, and the entire East coast, of Florida. This will evolve into a coastal low over the next few days bringing rain along the Southeast U.S. coast but it also leaves behind some clouds and some lingering moisture. This is the primary concern as to whether the launch can go ahead or not; how thick are the clouds that day, are there any pop-up showers and storms, and with those possible storms how high are the cloud tops? Based on Predictor (2nd Image), seemingly all of those rules are broken. Forecasts change and Florida is known to be one of the more difficult places to forecast for a variety of reasons. But for now it looks like the weather may put a damper on the first launch from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. Fortunately there are two other instantaneous launch windows this week on Saturday and Sunday!

Digging deeply within herself and collaborating with her team, the decision was to return with something that would communicate a real-life scenario that would further enhance the conversation.

A message that will bring about more respect and modesty to what today's mindset would consider as having a fun time.

The Nevada, itself smoking, made its break for the sea.
 "As we cleared the burning Arizona the harbor became visible to us," recalled Ensign Robert Thomas Jr., who had been knocked down when the Arizona blew up 300 feet away. "Good God! The West Virginia was awash and burning, the Oklahoma had capsized, the California was listing and afire. … I thought, 'We are the only ones left!'"
 But the big ship with two towering masts quickly caught the attention of the Japanese pilots. They couldn't let the Nevada get away to menace their ships. If they could sink it, they could block the entrance to the harbor. The fight was now between clouds of enemy planes and the crippled battleship.
 The Nevada fought back, but the diving planes hit home with as many as 10 bombs. The ship started to list, and officers realized that it might indeed go down in the harbor entrance. Orders came to end the escape attempt and beach the ship out of the way near Hospital Point.
 Fifty crewmen already had been killed and 109 wounded. None of the Patten brothers was hurt, Nelson wrote. And 3½ years later Bruce Patten was on a destroyer that steamed into Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender in 1945.
 Last month, James Delgado watched on his computer screen as an underwater robot examined a mysterious collection of wreckage about three miles beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
