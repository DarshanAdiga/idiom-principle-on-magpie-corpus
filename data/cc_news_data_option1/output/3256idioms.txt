The plan follows Oklahoma State Department of Health’s four-tiered, color- coded COVID-19 alert system for counties.
 Unlike much of the state, Garfield County is on an upward trend in active COVID-19 cases, said Maggie Jackson, with Garfield County Health Department. The county currently is in orange level as of Friday, at 24.57 cases per 100,000 people; 206 cases are currently active, as of Monday.
 OSDH releases county risk level reports each Friday to show the rate of community spread.
 EPS Superintendent Darrell Floyd edited the compromise plan between Friday and Monday’s board meeting, removing the plan for alternate A/B scheduling when in orange level and returning the proposed widened case tier thresholds to OSDH’s own numbers.
 Floyd said he did so after hearing from both OSDH and GCHD that they did not recommend school districts expand the level ranges set by OSDH epidemiologists.
 Orange level now ranges from 14.40-49.99 cases per 100,000, as the new plan combines the previous plan’s two orange levels — between 14.39-25 new positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in orange level 1, and 25-50 cases per 100,000 in level 2.
 A further revision from Friday to Monday also removes a needed board approval to move from one level to another based on a four-week period of trend line data, because A/B scheduling was no longer an option.
 A change in tier still will automatically take place, with parents having from Friday to Monday to make any work or child care schedule changes. However, this would only have serious effect moving from orange to red level, as parents already would have advanced warning because orange has a wide threshold range, Floyd said.
 The same safety protocol restrictions would apply while the district is in both yellow (1.43-14.39 cases) and orange levels.

The guard has already said he doesn’t remember coming into contact with any hotel guests, and NSW Health have not found any evidence of a breach in hotel quarantine. However, they’re now analysing CCTV footage to get to the bottom of what happened.
 The incident has also brought to light how people who don’t have steady, consistent work are more at risk when it comes to both catching and spreading the virus.
