A Russian court on Monday sentenced former US marine Paul Whelan to 16 years in prison for espionage.
 Whelan was arrested in 2018 and accused of seeking to obtain state secrets.
 The trial against the 50-year-old has been held behind closed doors as US and Russia relations have been at a low point, following accusations by the US intelligence community that Moscow interfered with the 2016 presidential election.
 US Ambassador to Moscow John Sullivan condemned the trial as unfair and lacking transparency. "It was secret, no evidence was produced, no allowances were made for defense witnesses," embassy spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter.

Back in 2016, when Donald Trump was elected, like many people I was shocked. In fact, I couldn't even look at him when his image appeared on TV, and I asked for the channel to be changed ‚Äî or at least the volume to be turned down.
 I remember thinking that the Democratic Party will now have the country served to it on a silver platter. There was no way the Democrats could mess this up.
