After the initial deployment of 650 troops was announced, Task & Purpose, a military-focused website, reported: "It was unclear whether the soldiers will eventually go to Iraq, but during the lead-up to the first surge, it was common for Army and Marine Corps units to deploy to Kuwait before being sent to Iraq. However, the United States and Iraq have agreed to a troop-cap of about 5,000 U.S. service members in Iraq. The Pentagon has not said whether the Iraqi government would have to approve a troop increase above the cap."

Jordyn Jenkins will miss the remainder of basketball season as she faces surgery to repair an ACL tear in her left knee, she confirmed Tuesday.
 Jenkins, a 6-foot-2, five-star senior forward at Kentridge High School who has signed with USC, was upbeat after getting the news from her doctor Tuesday morning following last week’s MRI.
 “I’m doing pretty good, actually,” she said. “I’ve been trying to stay positive all along and I think I knew it was my ACL, so I’m kind of glad I thought that way. Of course I was sad at first, but I had kind of prepared myself, so it’s like, I’m all right and I know I’ll get better.”

Making bus only ramps and giving buses open clearance on and off the bridge would be a little complicated, but much of that work has been done already- there are already bus-only ramps into and out of the new Transbay Terminal. So it's really just a question of adding signs, paint, and dividers for transit lanes. Some are talking about an older proposal that had a contraflow bus-only lane, but that's motivated by a desire to, again, do the absolute minimum to perturb individuals in private cars. In reality, just taking a lane in each direction for buses-the moral way to do it-is simple as hell.

Communities with strong educational and health care institutions can help to eliminate low wage workers, unemployment, crime, homelessness, and many other formidable struggles.
 Georgia’s Legislative Session is slated to begin on Monday, January 13, 2020. Each year legislators from outside Metro-Atlanta make the long trek to Georgia’s State Capitol to take care of the “people’s business.” Usually, the list of legislative priorities begins with the budget, and education, followed by healthcare, social services and retirement, along with many legislative Bills. Bills are offered and authored by legislators in both houses, in hopes that they will be voted upon and become law. Supposedly, Bills are sponsored for the purpose of improving the quality of life for all Georgians. On their own merits, some bills will be vigorously debated, while causing great consternation for both Democrats and Republicans.There are 56 State Senators and 180 State Representatives equipped with a myriad of professions and skills needed to make thorough and investigative decisions for the State budget and all budgetary items. Returning to the capitol year after year is necessary for preparation of the state budget and for no other reason. Preparing the State budget is the single most important issue for annually convening the state legislature. Locally, the legislative delegation representing approximately twenty Southwest Georgia counties, has already received legislative priorities from several governmental entities. Of course budgetary items always seem to take precedent over all other matters. One such item will address Math challenges in the State. Math Corps addresses gaps in math knowledge, beginning with elementary school students. Math Corps is an AmeriCorps program that provides schools with tutors to support math development in grades 4 through 8. During the 2018-2019 school year, Math Corps was chosen to make its initial launch in the Dougherty County School District, the first of its kind in the State. This math tutorial program has recorded positive results. Long range planning is to duplicate Math Corps programs across the entire State. Currently, it is housed in the Commodore Conyers College and Career Academy and utilized throughout the Dougherty County School District.Another important issue is that of the healthcare worker shortages, most notably among nurses. By 2030, the State of Georgia is expected to have the sixth worst nursing shortfall in the country. More than any other region of the State, Southwest Georgia battles challenges associated with attracting and retaining the best medical talent.
 Over the next decade, there will be a desperate push to make Albany a leader in filling the State’s nursing shortage. Partnerships such as Albany State University, Albany Technical College, Georgia Southwestern State University, Andrew College, Mercer School of Medicine, MCG/Georgia Health Sciences Clinical Campus, Morehouse School of Medicine, AHEC and other partners have master plans in the works for growing healthcare personnel.Along with this crucial nursing shortage, there is a need for behavioral health services for adults and children, especially between the ages of 8-15. In the Albany area alone, there is a need for 20 additional psychiatrists. How do we solve this medical dilemma? Local institutions of higher education and healthcare employers have begun discussions on ways to incentivize healthcare workers to become permanent residents in Southwest Georgia upon completion of their educational training. Communities with strong educational and healthcare institutions can help to eliminate low wage workers, unemployment, crime, homelessness, and many other formidable struggles.

Mandate of Heaven is a solid piece of DLC, giving you not just more Total War: Three Kingdoms, but more to think about as well. It forces you to rethink your approach if you really want to stay in control. You might fall into the trap of your normal playstyle and perhaps fail on your first attempt, but that won’t put you off, nor should it. It feels like it compliments the main game perfectly, and its seamless integration makes it feel right at home. The new characters to play as, and new battle units to experiment with certainly keep things fresh, as do the new mechanics that force you to keep your eye on the ball. And it gives you a sense more than ever before that things are happening behind the scenes, that enemies are plotting your downfall from right under your nose. It’s a meaty, addictive add-on that is thoroughly enjoyable.

CRANSTON -- City Council President Michael J. Farina on Tuesday announced that he will run for mayor, seeking election in November with the hope of landing in the office vacated by outgoing Mayor Allan W. Fung.
 Farina put out a lengthy news release in advance of a planned announcement early Tuesday evening.
 The former Democrat-turned-Republican says the right path for Cranston includes limits on taxes and reliance on its neighborhoods.
 "During my time in public service," Farina said in a statement, "my intentions have been and will continue to be, focusing on how to better the lives of Cranston's residents and, most importantly, limit the burdens on its hardworking taxpayers."
 Farina added: "Cranston's attraction and charm lies in the strength of its diverse and proud neighborhoods. Although Cranston's businesses, shopping centers and restaurants are second to none, it is our citizens and their families who reside within the city borders which makes our city the jewel of Rhode Island."
 The 41-year-old first won a City Council seat in 2012 and won reelection in 2014, 2016 and 2018.
 During his two most recent terms, he has been council president.
 Farina, a financial analyst, is a 1996 graduate of Cranston High School West and holds a bachelor's degree in business administration from Nichols College in Dudley, Massachusetts.
 He has supported efforts to reduce the vehicle excise tax and hopes to bolster the city's future growth by supporting an expansion of small businesses.
 Farina considers himself a champion of good ideas.
 "As a leader, it is imperative to be able to recognize a good idea," he said. "It simply does not matter if it originated as a Republican or Democrat idea. Experience has taught me there is no partisan monopoly on good ideas and regardless of where an idea."

Whilst both of these are fairly straightforward metrics, their implementation forces you to play differently. As Han supporters, you’ll constantly be checking your conquered settlements. You'll need to make sure the Public Order there doesn't disintegrate rather than just focusing on out and out expansion elsewhere. Zeal however for the rebellion almost pushes you to spread yourself too thinly attack-wise, as you drive for continuous victories. A humbling defeat at the hands of a strong warlord soon sets you straight. And it’s then that you realise that Mandate of Heaven really does feel like an expansion. Not just an expansion on ideas and mechanics, but on the emphasis of the delicate balance that running a kingdom requires. Certain metrics in the main game that previously looked after themselves, but now require you to add them to the many spinning plates you must keep on track.

Afterwards, Khan reiterated his desire to fight American Floyd Mayweather.
 "I really believe I've earned my shot against the best boxer in the world and that's Mayweather," said Khan.
 "He is the ideal fight for me. It would be a game of chess, but I would be too skilful. I have the skill and movement to beat him. He will not be able to hurt me.
 "I feel better now than I did when I was 25. I'm dedicated to the sport and I know there's a few years left in me. I'm going to try and force that fight with Mayweather."
 On a roll   ---   Amir Khan has won all four of his fights since he was stopped by Danny Garcia in July 2012      Khan, who has now won 30 of his 33 professional contests, was in complete control as the three judges scored it 119-109, 118-110 and 120-108 in his favour at the MGM Grand.
 Alexander, from St Louis, had won world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight but was outclassed by his fast and more accurate opponent, who retained the lightly-regarded WBC 'silver' welterweight belt.
 Under the guidance of trainer Virgil Hunter, Khan consistently beat his opponent to the punch with the American taking a large amount of punishment from the jab as he suffered only his third professional defeat in a 29-fight career.
 Before the fight, Mayweather said he wanted Philippine great Manny Pacquiao to be his next opponent, although that fight has been talked about for many years without it happening.

Police were called to Gloucester's Back Shore early Tuesday morning on a report of a car that drove off the sea wall and down onto the rocks, at the intersection of Moorland and Atlantic roads.
 The driver, identified in a police accident report as a 35-year-old Gloucester resident, explained to police that he was driving down Moorland Road — which runs along the Bass Rocks Golf Course — at about 50 mph, in an area with a posted 25 mph speed limit. He said he did not realize there was an intersection at the end and drove straight through, across Atlantic Road and off the wall.
 There is a stop sign on Moorland Road, which is perpendicular to Atlantic and the ocean. The accident occurred around 5:15 a.m.

NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS - Clemson had to figure it was going to take a decent amount of points in order to win Monday's showdown for the CFP National Championship against high-scoring LSU and that fell mostly on the shoulders of quarterback Trevor Lawrence.
   
 The sophomore who was outstanding the second half of this season and was dominant in two playoff victories last year wasn't able to deliver, playing poorly most of the evening in a 42-25 loss. The 6-foot-6 star played small, looking out of sorts with his accuracy most of the evening, never seeming to find any sort of groove with his fleet of wide-outs.
   
 "It was a lot of different things," Lawrence said. "First of all, I think LSU did a good job. They brought a lot of pressure and did a good job mixing up the coverages. But at the end of the day I just didn't play well enough for us to win. Too many missed plays by me, missed a lot of receivers, and it just wasn't my night."
   
 Clemson coach Dabo Swinney added, "We've had so much just unbelievable success, so many great things, and he's never lost a game and he's not going to lose many. I'll go ahead and tell you that right now. He's going to be a hard guy to beat forever because he's special. And he had a tough night tonight. For whatever reason, just didn't have his best night."
   
 And to think it all started so promising even as the Tigers didn't take full advantage of some early opportunities driving into LSU territory, coming away with only seven first-quarter points.
   
 Lawrence completed 10 of his first 15 throws for 161 yards and over that span ran for a short touchdown and then it was all downhill from there. After his solid start, Lawrence completed only 8 of 22 for 63 yards the rest of the way to finish 18 of 37 for 234 yards. Clemson was only 1 of 11 on third down tries.
   
 "I think a couple times they had us schemed up pretty good and they stopped us on 3rd down, then a handful, at least four, were missed throws or just them making a good play on the ball," Lawrence said. "So it's a lot of different things. But like I said, at the quarterback position if you're going to win games like this, you've got to play really well, and I just didn't do that tonight."
   
 It was the only time in his career Lawrence failed to throw at least one touchdown pass in a game and brought an end to his 25-game win streak as a starter. Including his time as a backup, he'd begun his college career 29-0. Lawrence began the night having thrown for multiple touchdowns in nine- consecutive games (having a stretch of eight straight with at least three broken in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal victory over Ohio State).
   
 The battle between what is likely to be the top overall picks in each of the next two NFL Drafts was completely one-sided in favor of Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow who was undeterred by Clemson's nationally top-ranked passing and scoring defense. Burrow was befuddled early by Clemson and Brent Venables scheme before figuring things out to score on their final three first half possessions.
   
 Burrow had a record-setting night with 463 yards and five touchdown passes on 31 of 49 passing and rushing for 58 yards and a touchdown.
   
 Lawrence didn't throw any interceptions but as he was trying to lead a last gasp effort trailing 42-25 with 3:53 left, Grant Delpit knocked the ball loose from Lawrence after a 10-yard gain the LSU's 42. It was recovered by Derek Stingley Jr. for the lone turnover of the night by either side.
   
 "Any big game like this when you're playing a really good team it's going to be physical," Lawrence said. "Just little things I know I can do. I can be more accurate. I wasn't accurate tonight. Didn't put the ball where it needed to be, didn't give my guys a chance enough, and it comes down to that really, giving them a chance, and I just didn't do a good job of doing that.
   
 A very rare, very off night for one of the best quarterbacks in the country helped decided the Tigers ending, but they'll like right back at or near the top of most preseason polls because of Lawrence.
   
 "I wouldn't trade him for nobody in the world," running back Travis Etienne said. "This is his first loss and what a great quarterback and great guy he is. Maybe he had one bad day, so what, I'd still take him over anybody."

That's not why the Titans fired Mike Mularkey two years ago after losing in the divisional round of the playoffs, preferring to gamble on hiring a coach who could push them to compete for championships. They chose Vrabel as a first-time head coach, and the former 14-year linebacker with three Super Bowl rings has the Titans a win away from the franchise's second Super Bowl berth and first since the 1999 season.
 Vrabel's message since mid-April has been pushing the Titans to find a way to go from good to great after three straight 9-7 seasons. Tennessee went 9-7 again during the regular season, but Vrabel isn't ready to grade his team yet, not before the AFC championship game Sunday at Kansas City (13-4). It will be the Titans' first time playing for the conference title since the 2002 season.
 “Well, I think that we have certainly improved,” Vrabel said. “I think we've made progress. Something that we focused on a while back is just trying to continue to improve each and every week. So, how close we are, I don't know that. I know that we're going to do what we've done for a long time, and what we know is to prepare to try to go in and play with confidence and execute.”
 That focus on improvement has endeared him to the Titans. He has a hands-on approach whether he's banging away at a football being carried by Derrick Henry during a running back drill or wearing a blocking pad to work on technique with linebackers and defensive linemen. Four-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jurrell Casey loves how Vrabel and all his coaches are involved and detail-oriented at practice.
 But it's Vrabel's mindset that Casey appreciates most.
 “He doesn't care about the wins, he don't care about none of that that happened,” Casey said. “He's excited for that moment. But he's onto the next. His mindset is always onto the next. 'We can cherish the moments for a bit, but let's get back to the grind. I don't care about the excuses you have. You're sore, whatever. You get back in this building and get back to it.'"
 Vrabel dealt with numerous injuries during his first season, including starting quarterback Marcus Mariota missing the regular-season finale, which the Titans lost with a playoff berth on the line.
 His biggest challenge came in mid-October this season. The Titans had scored only one touchdown in a 10-quarter stretch capped by a 16-0 loss at Denver that dropped Tennessee to 2-4. At that point, Vrabel benched Mariota for veteran Ryan Tannehill, who had been acquired in a trade with Miami to upgrade the backup position.
 The Titans (11-7) are 9-3 since then, including winning their last three on the road. They clinched the AFC's No. 6 seed in the regular-season finale against AFC South champ Houston, beat the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots in New England and then knocked off the top-seeded Ravens in Baltimore. Vrabel is the Titans' first coach to win his first two postseason games since Jeff Fisher after the 1999 season.
 “They're playing real good football right now,” Kansas City coach Andy Reid said. “They're strong. They're well-coached. Mike does a nice job with them.”
 Vrabel, who greets each player outside the locker room door after games, says he's made clear that everyone should be held accountable. That includes himself as he works to improve as a coach.
 His approach has helped build a locker room where teammates hold each other responsible for their preparation and play.
 “I ain't going say the guy is perfect, but he damn near understands football better than anybody in this building, outside this building,” Casey said. “ The guy, he's an intelligent dude. It's not really too much you can question that man.”
 Safety Kevin Byard credits Vrabel for a culture change he calls “nothing short of incredible."
 “Not only having the communication open with the players but actually getting on the field,” Byard said. “Not necessarily practicing with them but actually getting in the drills. I think that he really has done something special to the players as far as really being able to trust him and trust what he's trying to get us to do week in and week out."

The Disciplinary Council of Dhaka University (DU) on Tuesday recommended expulsion 67 students for their involvement in admission test forgery, drug abuse and possessing illegal arms.       Of them, 63 have been expelled for admission test forgery and the rest four for drug abuse, possessing illegal arms.   The university authorities suspended 13 more students for mugging and two others for beating up journalists. Show cause notices were also issued against the suspended students, asking them to explain their stance within seven working days.   The Disciplinary Council took the decision at its meeting on the day with Vice- Chancellor (VC) Prof Md Akhtaruzzaman in the chair. DU proctor Professor AKM Golam Rabbani, also the member-secretary of the committee, confirmed the matter.   He said the accused students were involved in question paper leak and admission test forgery. They also helped others to follow illegal means to get admitted to the university, he added.   "The Syndicate will now take the final decision," Golam Rabbani said.    He said the university authorities won't spare anyone involved in anti- disciplinary activities.   On June 23 last year, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) pressed charges against 87 of 125 students on different charges, including admission test forgery. "CID, a private TV Channel and DU authorities jointly investigated this matter and identified 125 students," the proctor said.   On August 6, 2019, the Dhaka University authorities suspended 69 students on charge of cheating in admission test.   Later, the university authorities issued show cause notices, asking them to explain their stance over the allegation brought against them within seven days.   The explanations provided by the accused did not satisfy the authorities and they recommended expulsion of the students.

 Those tools include educational programming as well as physical and mental health services.

Support from the government regarding the adoption of micro irrigation systems is a key factor behind the development of micro irrigation systems market. The declining level of ground water has called for some critical goals for the issue, for example, reception of micro irrigation. Micro irrigation is feasible as it helps spare 50-60% water than what is utilized in stream irrigation and other conventional irrigation strategies. Because of this, various governments are empowering the utilization of micro irrigation and offering concession in deployment cost of micro irrigation systems. A few governments, for example, those of Norway, India, and Switzerland are additionally encouraging the popularity of micro irrigation systems. For instance, in India, the state administration of Tamil Nadu has reported 100% financial support for small agriculturists taking up micro irrigation and 75% for the other farmers as well.
