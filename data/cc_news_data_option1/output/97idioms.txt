What does a cranberry farmer do in these cold, short days of winter? Well, the short answer is not as much outside when the weather turns nasty. The longer answer is somewhat more difficult to pin down. December is always a relatively quiet month in cranberry land with weather conditions leaning towards cold, wet rain and snow. Couple that with many growers looking to decompress after the harvest season and then the holiday craziness, the month seems to slip away quickly. As we head into January, and winter hasn't quite yet started to bore down heavily, there is much activity going on where the general public would never suspect.
 One thing that is being worked on as long as the weather remains not too cold or snowy is bog renovation. Why renovate? What factors influence which bogs will be renovated? Many reasons exist, but first here is a little background to set the stage.
 Approximately 50 percent of the bogs in Massachusetts are of the old-style cranberry bogs with traditional, heirloom cranberry varieties. The demand for large size fruit used in the manufacturing of sweetened dried cranberries and the need to ensure the long-term survival of Massachusetts growers has sparked a "retooling" or renovation of many old-style cranberry bogs. Since Massachusetts is the oldest commercial growing region in North America, many of the cranberry bogs have been continuously producing for over 120 years and have cranberry varieties that were selections from the wild. While Massachusetts cranberry bogs have been resilient in their ability to continuously produce, there is a need by many to renovate with newer, higher- yielding, modern varieties in order to compete long term with other growing regions that have new, more productive varieties. This is also what the marketplace is looking for with the growing global demand for dried cranberry products. The manufacturers tell us the larger berries make for a better dried fruit product, and the heirloom varieties do not measure up as well.
 Renovation also has important environmental benefits. Many old bogs are significantly out of grade and require large volumes of water to completely cover the beds for harvest or winter protection. New technology allows growers to design highly efficient systems that are laser-leveled, with state-of-the- art irrigation and water management systems that greatly reduce water use. Prior renovations of many Massachusetts bogs have resulted in a net gain of 375 million gallons of water being conserved annually.
 You may ask what does it mean to renovate or "retool" a bog? It involves using bulldozers and related construction equipment to pull up all the existing vines, move the soil and level the bog with fresh sand in preparation for planting new vines. Growers may also square off the cranberry beds to increase operation efficiency. From time to time, it is also necessary to upgrade or replace irrigation systems and water control structures.
 While this seems to be a lot of work and expense, investing in the renovation of cranberry bogs has a direct local impact. It is a capital-intensive endeavor that requires expensive skilled labor to operate equipment and investments in new irrigation equipment, as well as the purchase of raw materials such as sand and cranberry vines to rebuild the bogs. The average cost to renovate or retool an acre of cranberry bog is about $50,000. It takes three years for the bog to begin producing fruit again and five to six years to reach full production. The return on investment can be 10 years or more. This is a long-term investment in the future vitality of the bog. With the high cost, loss of production and extended period to break even, bog renovation is not a decision that is made quickly. For some growers, it remains out of reach under the current industry economics.
 Other winter tasks that are occurring now include cleaning ditches in the bogs to remove excess sediment and plant material. Water inlets and outlets that are part of the bog's water management system can become choked over time and require periodical cleaning. If the weather holds, it can also be a time to repair access roads, dikes, ditches and dams. Trimming back and removing brush and trees that are impeding on the bog and its access is also happening now. So as long as the snowflakes stay away and the temperature doesn't plummet, there is still a lot of activity taking place on our local cranberry bogs.

In the aftermath of the deadly Ukraine Flight PS752 crash, Canadians are left to mourn not just the loss of life, but the loss of the future so many of the victims had hoped to help build.


  All 176 people on board Ukraine Flight PS752 were killed early on Wednesday morning when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran.


  The flight was headed for Kiev, but the vast majority of them - 138 according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - were connecting to Canada.


  Sixty-three of them were Canadian nationals, but many more called Canada their home, at least temporarily.


  They lived in cities like Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. Many were students or professors, working on important research in their fields.


  US sanctions have made it increasingly difficult to travel between Iran and Canada, and the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev and then to Toronto is popular because it is one of the most affordable options for the journey, said Younes Zangiabadi with the Iranian Canadian Congress.

"If last night was the theatre of retaliation, what today brings is political consolidation and domination of the pro-Iran factions," Toby said.
 The Hashed's political arm, the Fatah bloc, has already seized on anti-US sentiment over the last week to push for a total ouster of foreign troops from Iraqi territory.
 Some 5,200 American troops and hundreds more British, French, Canadian and other forces are based in Iraq to help local forces defeat jihadist sleeper cells.
 On Wednesday, Iraqis' reactions to Iran's strikes were much tamer than the anger expressed at the US last week.

 While appearing to be pro-Washington in the current climate carries a political cost, some political figures may be busy behind the scenes trying to salvage Iraq's relationship with the US and restore some stability, however fragile.
 But, Mardini warned, "if the crisis escalates, Baghdad's space for manoeuvering will shrink. They'll be forced to pick a side -- and it won't be the US."

Friday, Jan. 3, saw the Pilot Rock Rockets visiting the Enterprise lady Outlaws, and going down in flames 55-22. The Outlaws were on fire from the word go. The defense allowed the fizzling Rockets only two points in the first quarter and remained miserly the rest of the battle.
 The offense secured the victory by shooting a sterling 43% from the field. Jada Gray and Zari Bathke played patty-cake with 12 points each and led the balanced scoring attack. Gray also had six thefts on defense. Rylin Kirkland chipped in with nine while Ashlyn Gray knocked with seven and raked in nine boards on the evening.
 A quick turnaround found the ladies at Grant Union shooting the Prospector defense full of holes with a quick 43-24 victory for their ninth straight win that never saw the Prospectors posing a serious threat.
 Zari Bathke served as lead shooter for the Outlaws, scoring 18 against the helpless Prospectors, shooting an amazing 67% from the field. Carsyn Miller stood next in line with seven points on the board and Claire Farwell added six.
 Defensively, Ashlyn Gray hauled in seven boards and somehow avoided arrest after 10 steals on the night while Miller pulled in a half-dozen boards.
 “It’s nice to go over and win there because it’s something we haven’t done for awhile,” coach Mike Crawford said. “We’re hanging in there.”
 He said that after the ladies meet Weston-McEwen on Friday, Jan. 10, the squad will face some of the toughest teams in the league the following week with back to back games versus Heppner and Stanfield.
 “We’ll find out what we’re made of and what the league’s made of when we go play them,” Crawford said. “This is the best start we’ve had in a long time — no doubt.”
 The coach said the ladies have a particularly strong defense this year, which is key to their success. He also noted that upcoming teams are scoring more points than the Outlaws, but also allowing opponents to score more points. He expects the ladies will also hold their main competition to low scoring, which will make them a formidable opponent.
 “I know we’re going to be a tough team to beat,” he said. “That being said, we have to go through each of those games and they’re going to be good ones.”
 The week left the Outlaws with a 2-0 league record and 10-1 overall. They co- occupy the first slot in the Blue Mountain Conference with Stanfield and are ranked fourth in State 2A ball.

Devotees clamber over one another to touch the life-size statue, wipe a towel on it or even just lay a hand on the ropes attached to its metal float.
 "We believe that if you pull the carriage, the Lord will cure all your diseases," 50-year-old vendor Boyet Lara said. "Nothing is impossible if we believe."
 Scores of the barefoot faithful pass out and suffer cuts or bruises in the crush around the statue, and in previous years believers have died in Catholic majority Philippines.
 "In 2016, the rope pulling the statue wrapped around my head and I nearly choked to death. But I managed to survive," said devotee Crisostomo Belarmino, 52.
 "I cried that time and said, 'Thank you Nazarene for giving me another life,'" he added.
 Organizers expected Thursday's procession to draw 6 million people. An early morning estimate by police put the crowd at around 400,000 people, excluding those waiting further along the procession's 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) route.
 Just hours into the procession, the Red Cross reported giving first aid to some 300 people at the procession, in line with previous years.
 The statue is named for its charred appearance and is accompanied by many difficult-to-prove stories, including that it survived a fire while en route to the Philippines in the 17th century.
 Critics call the procession a mishmash of superstition and unnecessary risk for the people who cram into the procession route each year.
 However, the defenders in the Philippines' powerful Catholic Church note that it is a vibrant expression of faith.
 Many devotees swear the Black Nazarene has brought them help when they needed it most.
 "When my husband suffered a stroke two years ago, even if I didn't ask for financial help, I got it," vendor Angeline Mara, 43, said.
 "Every time I hear the song for the Nazarene, I feel like I'm about to cry," she added.
 Though authorities did not report any specific threat to this year's procession, there was a typically massive presence of thousands of police on Manila's streets.
 The Philippines is plagued by violent insurgencies, including from Islamic State-linked militants that have carried out bombings on civilian targets.

Boro are not quite out of the woods yet, although a 10-point buffer is far more substantial than it was on November 30.


  Perhaps the most telling facet for Boro – awarded the LMA Performance of the Week for their festive win at West Brom – is that it has been achieved without several senior players.


  The likes of 2018-19 PFA Championship Team of the Year member Darren Randolph, completing the finishing touches to a move to West Ham and £15m forward Britt Assombalonga have been absent, alongside Ryan Shotton and George Friend.


  In their absence, the likes of Marcus Tavernier, Hayden Coulson, Djed Spence and Aynsley Pears are stepping up, with Woodgate blooding them out of necessity and not choice.

Two of the actors in “The Band’s Visit,” the smash hit coming to the Fox Theatre in Midtown Jan. 21 through 26, said it’s like no musical they’ve ever seen or participated in before.


  “What makes the show stand out for me is the characters in this show are some of the most human and real portrayals of regular life that I’ve ever seen on stage,” said Mike Cefalo, who plays Telephone Guy. “These people are longing for real everyday human ideals. Some people are lonely, some are dealing with a failed marriage. It’s just raw, human, simple connections displayed on stage. It’s just amazing.”


  Janet Dacal, who plays Dina, added, “I would say this is a very unique theatrical experience. … It’s welcoming and culture-rich and joyful. So I would highly recommend coming to visit us while we’re in town. It’s humorous. It’s authentic. It’s visually and auditorily very beautiful. The music is very special and different than most Broadway shows I’ve either seen or been a part of.”


  “The Band’s Visit’s” North American tour is stopping in town as part of the Fifth Third Bank Broadway in Atlanta series.


  Based on the 2007 Israeli film with the same name, it premiered off Broadway in 2016 and on Broadway the following year, with the North American tour starting in 2019. The musical broke the all-time box office record at Broadway’s Ethel Barrymore Theatre twice. It stars Sasson Gabay as Tewfiq, the role he played both in the movie and on Broadway before joining the tour.


  In 2018 “The Band’s Visit” won 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Actor in a Musical (Tony Shaloub) and Best Actress in a Musical (Katrina Lenk). It also won the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, plus several honors from other organizations.


  According to the musical’s overview posted to the Broadway Across America website, “In this joyously offbeat story, set in a town that’s way off the beaten path, a band of musicians arrive lost, out of the blue. Under the spell of the desert sky, and with beautiful music perfuming the air, the band brings the town to life in unexpected and tantalizing ways. Even the briefest visit can stay with you forever.”


  Cefalo, a Pittsburgh native, and Dacal, who grew up in Los Angeles, both live in New York when not on tour. They will be visiting Atlanta for the first time, though Dacal said she once drove through the city.


  She said she’s looking forward to “just getting to know the people and the locals and spending time in the culture.”


  “From what I’ve seen, (the Fox) is quite beautiful and I’m thrilled to be able to perform there,” Dacal said. “ … I’m really excited Atlanta will have a chance to experience ‘The Band’s Visit,’ particularly at the Fox Theatre.”


  Said Cefalo, “I’ve heard the Fox Theatre is actually quite stunning. And I’ve never really been to the South, so I’m just excited there will be good weather. I just had a friend move there from New York and a couple of family members (live) there.”


  Cefalo said “The Band’s Visit” wowed him when he first saw it on Broadway.


  “My jaw was on the floor,” he said. “It’s like when you see an indie movie you don’t know anything about and there’s a lot of hype about it, and it … delivers. It’s nothing like another Broadway musical. It’s not splashy or over the top. It’s a slice of real life that is elevated in such a way that it’s an insanely captivating story.


  “It’s heightened in all ways by the music by David Yazbek and this beautiful sense of music directed by Patrick McCollum, our choreographer. Our director, David Cromer, knew exactly the way to kind of frame and articulate this (idea). All the pieces come together to give a uniform aesthetic that we created. This tone kind of carries the whole show and you can’t take your eyes off of it.”

PLYMOUTH - One of the early checkpoints for a local high school wrestling team is the Marshfield Holiday Tournament that happens each year over Christmas break at Marshfield High. Stacked top to bottom with great programs from Massachusetts and Rhode Island, a win in this two-day wrestlefest is something you can hang your hat on.
 There were 38 teams in the mix this year and Cumberland, RI took home the team title with a solid performance up and down the order. They placed 12 wrestlers in the top 12 of the 14 weight classes, including five wrestlers in the finals, on the way to a team-best 268.5 points.
 St. John's Prep was second with 224.5 team points. They were followed by Walpole (174.5), Plymouth South (173) and Mount Hope (164). Hingham finished one spot out of the top 5 in sixth place with 151 team points.
 Other local teams in action included Plymouth North (22nd, 72.5 points), Marshfield (23rd, 66 points) and Silver Lake placed 28th with 50 team points.
 There was some good balance with the individual weight class winners. Three schools had two winners each and eight schools came away with one winner for their efforts.
 Plymouth South junior Lucas Pinzino wrestled a great tournament, winning the 138 pound weight class.
 Coming into the action as the sixth seed, Pinzino started the tournament with two pins and decision. Pinzino put in the work in the final two rounds by beating #2 seed Daniel Clapp from Norton High in the semifinals with a pin at 3:09 and then he finished the job with a pin of top seed Mason Lynch from Cumberland, RI in the finals seconds of regulation in the championship match.
 Pinzino continues to climb the state rankings in his weight class. He's moved up from 126 pounds where he wrestled as a sophomore and is having no problem wrestling with the extra weight.
 "We lost him at the end of last season after finger surgery, which was a shame because he was having such a great year," South Head Coach Marc Loranger. "Lucas is a wrestler's wrestler and he lives and breathes the sport. He works so hard and gives 100 percent all the time so it's great to see him win this title against a kid (Lynch) who was ranked eighth in New England at the end of last year."
 The Panthers had three wrestlers check in at fourth place for the tournament. Picking up big points for the team were Hunter Hasenfus (145 pounds), Jack Ottino (170 pounds) as well as heavyweight James Kernen.
 Lucas Cappola was seventh at 152 pounds and Colby Stasiowski took 10th at 182 pounds.
 Plymouth North got two wrestlers to the finals and had another grappler earn an 11th place finish.
 The top two seeds made their way to the finals at 113 pound where North's Brandon Nguyen lost a major decision to top seed Nicholas Curley from St. John's Prep.
 Blue Eagle senior AJ Dias also wrestled his way to the finals of the 220 pound weight class, picking up a pin and two close decisions to get to the finals, where he would be matched up against top seed Naziah Armor from Brockton High. Armor came away with a 3-1 win.
 Plymouth South (10-2) and Plymouth North each have a home meet Tuesday night. The Panthers will host Scituate and North is at home to take on Silver Lake.
 South has a quad meet Saturday starting at 10 a.m. with Silver Lake, Masconomet Regional and Lincoln-Sudbury.

"Trust us. That's really what it all boils down to," Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said after a classified briefing top administration officials gave members of the House.
 "But I'm not sure that 'trust me' is a satisfactory answer for me," Engel said.
 In contrast, Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the Senate's meeting "one of the best briefings" he's had as a member of Congress. He said the information was "crystal clear."
 Some Republicans joined Democrats in criticizing the administration's presentations.
 Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said it was "probably the worst briefing I've seen, at least on a military issue, in the nine years I've served in the United States Senate."
 He said he found it "insulting and demeaning" for administration briefers to warn lawmakers against debating the merits of further military action against Iran because that would only embolden Tehran.
 "It is not acceptable for officials within the executive branch of government ... to come in and tell us that we can't debate and discuss the appropriateness of military intervention against Iran. It's un-American, it's unconstitutional, and it's wrong," Lee said, adding that he now planned to support a war powers resolution introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.
 At one point, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, asked when, if not in this instance, would the administration consult Congress, according to a Senate aide familiar with the private session but unauthorized to discuss it by name. The answer from the top officials was basically a disinterest in consulting Congress, the aide said, leading some senators to storm out.
 The House is expected to vote this week on a similar resolution to limit Trump's military actions regarding Iran.
 Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he thought the congressional briefings offered lawmakers a compelling argument that the intelligence supported the strike on Soleimani. But he noted that only eight lawmakers — the top four lawmakers in the House and Senate and chairmen and vice chairmen of the intelligence committees in both chambers — are the only members of Congress who are authorized to see all the intelligence.
 "One of the challenges, of course, is not everybody has, in fact most members of Congress do not have, access to the intelligence that I think was the most compelling," Esper said. "That's just simply the nature of the intelligence, and it's restricted to the Gang of Eight."
 Democrats also are skeptical of the timing of the strike, which comes in the run-up to a Senate impeachment trial and at the start of a presidential election year. It's the same skepticism that some Republicans expressed in 1998 when they accused President Bill Clinton of using military strikes on Iraq to interrupt and delay a pending impeachment resolution against him.
 A top defender of the president, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said afterward that "there's no question" the killing was justified.
 Asked if she was convinced by the briefing that Iranian attacks were imminent before the Soleimani strike, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said, "Yes. My questions were answered and satisfied."
 Democrats weren't convinced.

“I trusted my instincts. I trusted my dribble move, and I pulled it back and knocked the shot down.”
 Failures like the potential game winner turned charge against Miami have been equally as important to Dosunmu’s development as his successes. Both can be crucial learning experiences.
 “You’re not going to make every one,” Dosunmu said. “You’ve got to deal with the times where you miss it and deal with the times you fail. I’ve accepted that, and it helped me to get to the spot now where I know when I put it up late game it’s going to go in.”
 While Dosunmu’s late three-pointer stood out as a game-changing play and he did lead Illinois with 18 points — just three shy of Wisconsin guard Kobe King’s game-high 21 — closing Wednesday’s win was more about scoring for the Chicago native.
 “I hit Alan in transition,” he said. “I hit Kofi on a late lob. I hit Trent (Frazier) in the corner and hit Alan for another three. That’s four plays in a row where, yeah, the play was called for me, but that doesn’t mean I have to shoot it. You’ve got to make the right play.”
 Dosunmu made plenty of the right plays in Wednesday’s momentous Illinois victory. It’s one the Illini didn’t plan on celebrating all that long with an 11 a.m. Saturday game against Rutgers — arguably one of the hottest teams in the Big Ten right now — looming.
 “To quote Bill Belichick, ‘Rutgers. Rutgers. Rutgers,’” Underwood said was his message to his team following the win. “ If you’ve all seen that video, you know that’s really funny. It’s on to the next. It’s on to the next. You don’t get to enjoy these very long, but I’m really proud of them and happy for them. It’s on to the next.”

I was sitting around a table at a neighborhood party, enjoying the conversation with some friends before Christmas. The room was loud - the adults were speaking with raised voices, sometimes having to yell across the table at one another - because the nearby rooms were filled with the boisterous chaos that comes with a house full of kids.      But I took notice. Not because of the volume level. But because no one seemed to mind.      The kids, representing a wide range of ages, played video games in one room, while the adults talked in another room, and when things got too rambunctious, a parent stepped in to referee or supervise. But the adult conversation continued largely uninterrupted, as if the boisterous gang of children didn't exist in the next room.      At one point, when my 4-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were wrestling a human-sized stuffed toy and my youngest ended in up in tears, I apologized for our kids' chaos as my husband stepped away from the adult table to separate our children.      I apologized again, before I realized something refreshing: No one was fazed by our chaos. Everyone at the small gathering had children of their own.      It was a refreshing reminder that every family comes with their own kind of craziness. It was a relief to be in an environment where we could be ourselves, and our kids could be themselves, too.      There is an old saying that children should be seen and not heard. It would be nice if every child were obedient and quiet and did as they were told - but I'm betting that even in my grandparents' day, that even though that was the expectation, there was still some chaos. It's par for the course, part of the territory. We can expect children to be appropriately behaved for a certain amount of time in certain situations - say, in church, at a funeral or at a nice restaurant.      Being the mom of three kids can be exhausting, trying to juggle a full-time job, the kids' busy extracurricular schedules and housework, I'm personally over the idea of trying to keep my children "perfect" all the time.      When my older kids were preschoolers, I'd dress them only in smocked and appliqued boutique clothing. My oldest daughter wouldn't leave the house without a bow in her hair. We expected the kids to behave perfectly, all the time, the second they stepped out our door. But more often than not, we ended out more stressed because one kid ended up with Kool-Aid spilled down their white smocked dress or another kid got gum stuck in their hair or because one of our kids whined at a restaurant and we were worried we'd disturb the other patrons (when, in fact, no one else noticed.)      Eventually, my kids grew out of the smocked-and-appliqued phase. My youngest daughter refuses to wear hair bows at all. And while my younger self would have balked at the idea of buying a printed T-shirt for my little one, my youngest daughter refuses to wear anything "fancy." She rocks her favorite glitter-embossed unicorn T-shirt and leggings happily.      As I've gotten older, I guess I've learned to care less, not about my kids, but about what other people think.      Trying to make children be "perfect" all the time causes too much mental strife and too many gray hairs to be worth it. And staying inside the house for 18 years isn't an option. I hope that other people understand. We try our best. But nobody is perfect.      And while we teach children to behave, we shouldn't ask them to conform to a robotic ideal that's abnormal for who they really are. Sometimes it's refreshing to just be real. And sometimes, that means a little chaos.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Reach her at lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com.

You can eliminate a lot of disagreements with good communication. Establish your expectations ahead of time and you might be surprised at how smoothly things can go.


  Saying, "I expect you to keep your phone on silent and out of sight during the party" might prevent an argument at the event. Similarly, saying "I expect you to show up for at least two hours" could prevent a lot of confusion and frustration down the road.


  Of course, your teens might not agree with your expectations and you might get some pushback. But making your expectations clear ahead of time will give your teen time to calm down.

The setback only served to pump the Australian pairing up even more, getting the break back before Kyrgios served for the second set.


  De Minaur pulled out a beautiful drop shot at the net to secure the second frame, sending it to a third set super tiebreak up to 10.


  After Kyrgios held serve with two absolute bullets, de Minaur earned a mini- break by forcing Salisbury to hit the net. He then held his nerve and his serve to take a 5-2 lead.


  After looking fatigued from his earlier singles match, it was de Minaur's lightning quick reflexes at the net on Kyrgios' serve that gave Australia a 7-4 lead, while Salisbury and Murray patiently and determinedly refused to break on the other side of the net.


  At 8-6, GB pounced on de Minaur's second serve and Murray held to give them matchpoint at 9-8.


  From there, it was pure drama.


  Kyrgios held serve. 10-9 Australia.


  Salisbury held serve. 11-10 GB.


  On de Minaur's serve, Murray had an easy smash to an open court which could have given GB a chance to serve for the match. He sent it long. Very long, and de Minaur held serve twice. 12-11 Australia.


  It was then Salisbury's turn to send a smash long, giving Kyrgios match point on his own racquet.


  But de Minaur hit the net and we were back on serve.


  Salisbury held serve again, and in response, de Minaur could only hold one of his two serves, but sent a pin-point backhand return down the line on Murray's serve to stave off yet another Great Britain matchpoint.


  Kyrgios hit virtually the same shot moments later, caressing a sweet backhand return deep into Great Britain's court to send Australia up 17-16 with the ball in Kyrgios' hand.


  His first serve hit the net, but Salisbury's return on second serve sailed long and Australia advanced to the ATP Cup semi-finals after one of the most electrifying days of tennis you'll ever see.

"What did you say?" said my husband. "You think I need to get my meerkat net?"      "No. I said, 'I think you need to get your hearing checked!'" I sighed.      "My hearing is fine," he argued. "You were mumbling."      I shook my head. I am not a mumbler. Nor am I a soft-talker or a dog- whisperer. If anything, I'm typically whisper-challenged ... which is why I knew the issue was my husband, not me.      "Just go to the audiologist," I said.      "Why do I need an archeologist," he wondered.      I just stared at him and then left the room, muttering under my breath. Now if he didn't hear me at least there was good reason.      I, myself, had recently been diagnosed with an issue called Hidden Hearing Loss, which is really just a problem hearing conversation in a crowded room. On a side note, I also suffered from Silent Reflux and Phantom Knee Pain, so apparently, all my problems were secret ones. My husband, however, had a hard time hearing me clearly all the time. It was pretty obvious, at least to me, that there was nothing phantom about his hearing issues, although he may have had some not-so-hidden denial about it.      "I hear everything I need to hear," he said      "So, you have Selective Hearing Loss," I said.      "I dunno. Maybe," he replied.      "Which means you have elected not to hear me," I said.      He shrugged. "I probably can't hear my mother, either."      Eventually he went to get his hearing checked just to prove me wrong, and was surprised when the audiologist gave him her diagnosis.      "You have 'Spousal Hearing Loss,'" she said confidently.      "What does that mean?" we asked.      "You are tuning out the frequencies of your wife's speech," she said to my husband.      "Just me?" I wondered.      "Maybe his mother, too," she said. Clearly, she'd been around the block a few times with this topic.      "So, this is really a thing?" I asked her.      "Not officially," she replied. "But I do see a lot of it."   When we got home, I wondered if my husband would be able to hear me if I spoke an octave higher or lower. I decided to try out some different frequencies when talking to him to see if my theory worked. I am typically an alto so I had a wide range of other vocal ranges I could try.      "What do you want to do about dinner?" I sang in my highest operatic soprano. My husband was in the next room, so I thought it was a good test of our theory. I wasn't sure if he would hear me, but there was a good chance I might get a female solo in the next Met performance of La Traviata. At the very least, I knew at that pitch the dog could hear me.      "Yeah, I think you look a little thinner," he replied when he walked into the kitchen.      So, clearly going an octave higher didn't help.      "How about some fish," I asked, dropping my voice down to a tenor.      "Yes, honey," he said, coming behind me and wrapping his arms around my waist. "You are definitely a dish."      I smiled. Maybe this hearing loss issue wasn't such a bad thing.

Thursday marks three years of deadlock at Stormont since the assembly and executive collapsed.


  Talks aimed at getting devolved government back up and running are ongoing, but no agreement has yet been reached.


  The institutions collapsed in January 2017 when the two biggest parties - the DUP and Sinn Féin - clashed over a green energy scandal.


  Since then, several attempts to broker a deal have failed.


  But following the general election in December, there was a renewed focus on restoring the institutions.

As with all other elections, Maple Grove will be preparing all 24 of its polling places for Election Day voting and in-person absentee voting will be held at the government center 46 days prior to Election Day (Jan. 17). “This means going through all the usual equipment testing, public accuracy testing, preparing polling place supply totes, providing poll pad refresher training, and all the other tasks involved with preparing for any other election,” Dietl said.
 The city of Osseo is also training judges and preparing for the election. Osseo City Clerk LeAnn Larson said, “Aside from the normal two hours of election training required every two years for any election judge, there will be an additional one hour specifically for Presidential Nomination Primary training only.”
 She said social media information and/or email blasts will be sent as it gets closer to the actual absentee voting period (Jan. 17) and the election date in March.
 Larson added that practice time on the electronic pollbooks will be established for election judges in advance of the election.
 The city of Maple Grove, along with other cities, are facing one challenge with the March election. According to Dietl, it deals “with snowbird election judges who will be unavailable to work on Election Day. As such, the city continues to recruit election judges as well as temporary election staff to assist in-person absentee voters.”
 In Osseo, Larson said, “We are lucky in Osseo to have some new judges coming on board to replace those who will not be back to Minnesota in time. I am pleased these new people have stepped up to serve our city.”
 Dietl added, “Staff has already been preparing for a busy 2020. We will be providing 138 days of in-person voting to our residents as well as administering three elections.”
 This presidential nomination primary election is costing area cities more. The Office of the Secretary of State estimates the cost for the primary is about $11.9 million. Cities and municipalities will be reimbursed for their costs following the election.

Iranian investigators said Thursday the crew members of the Ukrainian jetliner that crashed on Wednesday never made a radio call for help and were trying to turn back to the airport when the plane went down.
 Iran’s civil aviation authority made the comments in a preliminary crash report a day after the crash of the Ukrainian jetliner that killed all 176 people on board.
 The investigators also said that the plane was engulfed in fire before it crashed. They said the crash caused a massive explosion when the plane hit the ground, likely because the aircraft had been fully loaded with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, Ukraine.
 The report also confirmed that both of the so-called “black boxes” that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they had damaged and some parts of their memory was lost.

China believes a mysterious pneumonia outbreak that struck 59 people is caused by a new strain of virus from the same family as SARS, which killed hundreds of people more than a decade ago.
 Lead scientist Xu Jianguo told the official Xinhua news agency that experts had "preliminarily determined" a new type of coronavirus was behind the outbreak, first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million.
 It initially sparked fears of a resurgence of highly contagious Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and prompted authorities in Hong Kong -- badly hit by SARS in 2002-2003 -- to take precautions, including stepping up the disinfection of trains and airplanes, and checks of passengers.
 China has since ruled out a fresh outbreak of SARS, which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong.
 "A total of 15 positive results of the new type of coronavirus had been detected" in the lab, through tests on infected blood samples and throat swabs, Xu said.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the preliminary discovery of a new coronavirus in a statement.
 "Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented," said Gauden Galea, the WHO Representative to China.
 Wuhan's health commission said on Sunday seven of the 59 patients were seriously ill, but none had died. All received treatment in quarantine.
 Eight patients have recovered and were discharged from hospital on Wednesday, according to Xinhua.
 The commission said the infection broke out between December 12 and 29, with some of the patients employed at a city seafood market since closed for disinfection.
 No obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported so far.
 Footage from January 1 by state broadcaster CCTV showed an official notice at the market saying it had been closed in light of the "current pneumonia situation in our city", without providing a date for reopening.
 The outbreak comes just a few weeks before China's busiest annual travel period, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Lunar New Year.
 A Chinese transport ministry official said at a briefing that arrangements were made for "disinfection, monitoring and prevention" focusing on areas with large numbers of passengers, including stations and cargo hubs.
 Civil aviation and national railway authorities said they had not received any reports of affected patients taking flights or trains, and that they were closely watching the situation.
 Wan Xiangdong, chief flight officer of China's Civil Aviation Administration, said all planes were equipped with emergency medical kits.
 WHO representative Galea said "people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports".
 The organisation has not recommended any travel restrictions on China.
 \- Hong Kong, Taiwan fears -
 In Hong Kong, hospitals have raised their alert level to "serious" and stepped up detection measures -- including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.
 Authorities in the financial hub say 38 people have been hospitalised in recent days after returning from Wuhan and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the mystery virus.
 Some 21 of the 38 patients had been discharged by Wednesday.
 City residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week.
 Inbound trains and flights from the mainland are undergoing extra cleaning and disinfection, authorities said.
 Additional thermal imaging systems have been set up at the city's airport, while inbound high-speed rail passengers from the mainland face checks by hand-held infrared thermometers.
 The coming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where top officials urged the island's health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports.
 On Monday, the country's centre for disease control also advised residents planning to travel to or near Wuhan to wear masks and avoid contact with wild animals.
 The US embassy in China warned on Tuesday that Americans travelling in the country should avoid animals and contact with sick people.

On the surface, America has divided into name-calling camps organized around powerful and opposed moral certainties. Dig deeper, however, and a lack of faith drives much of the anger. The campus culture that energizes our national conflicts blends radical doubt with overbearing moralism. Deconstructionist scholars paint our national and civilizational narratives as delusions, yet with certainty that those narratives are designed to oppress. Academics portray the Founders’ belief in natural freedom and equality as a Western prejudice, or a ruse of the powerful, while drawing on those same classically liberal beliefs to fuel their outrage.

To get to the bottom of what ails us, we have to go back to the beginning. What is Western Civilization? How was it taught? Why did its teaching disappear? And how has that changed us? How has comprehensive skepticism yielded up blinding moral certainty? And is there a way back? Ever since the Stanford controversy, deconstructionist historians have claimed that Western Civilization is an illusion — a late invention designed to hoodwink Americans into fighting and dying in Europe, while forcing immigrants to surrender their culture. It turns out, however, that this modern academic narrative is itself an illusion and a lie.

It is true that many federal roads spread around the country are now under some form of construction, and, or rehabilitation. The Minister of Works recently said 524 road projects are currently being executed by his ministry in various parts of the country. This should be a cause for celebration under different circumstances, but in this case it becomes a cause for intense introspection for the intense suffering and distress that would follow. Road constructions seemingly go on for ever. Work on the dual Kano-Maiduguri carriageway has been going on for over ten years. The Lagos-Ibadan and Abuja- Lokoja highways have spent similar stretch of years under some form of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of Abuja-Kano highway that was flagged off last year has put any one using that road on tenterhooks, because since the work started very little grounds seems to have been covered. To worsen matters the palliative rehabilitation on failed portions of the road seemed to have stalled. The agony the commuters face daily to reach Kaduna, Zaria and Kano is excruciating.

President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017. He has not visited India but has said that he would "some time.”


  There were high hopes from some that U.S.-India relations would continue to strengthen under his presidency. In point of fact, they have not. They have become primarily functional.


  In my opinion, that is the best that can be expected with and from this president. Partnership, cooperation, and collaboration are not words that are in his vocabulary. Nationalism, isolationism and protectionism are.


  Nonetheless, India and the U.S. will have a true strategic partnership in the future.


  That strategic partnership will deliver on the vision set out by President Eisenhower. Speaking to India's Parliament in 1959, Ike stated that the welfare of India and the U.S. were linked together.


  The potential that he envisioned for an alliance between India and the U.S. is being realized. There is still quite a way to go to achieve it fully and there are no guarantees because the future is promised to no one.


  Either country could lose its course and make the partnership less feasible if it abandons its commitment to a unifying and uplifting democracy. India and the U.S. must also discover how to work closely together in order to earn the strategic partnership label and become "one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century.”


  The journey has begun. Time and tenacity will determine how and where it will end.

"PayPal Giving Fund remains on standby to release the funds raised by Celeste Barber for the NSW RFS," a PayPal Giving Fund spokesperson said on Thursday afternoon.


  "We are supporting the NSW RFS as they work through their processes to accept the record-breaking amounts that have been raised, and are aware that the RFS remain focused on the ongoing bushfire emergency."


  The spokesperson said the organisation was working to fast-track donations made through its platform in light of Australia's bushfire crises, having already streamlined millions of dollars donated through other campaigns.


  This process ensures the money goes to the intended fund, is donated in compliance with the law and that donors are not being scammed, the spokesperson says.


  "One hundred per cent of the money donated to charities on Facebook through PayPal Giving Fund is received by charities," the spokesperson said.


  ## Will the money just go to NSW firefighters?


  When Barber launched the fund, she was doing so in response to the situation affecting her family in NSW and only expected to raise $30,000.


  But as the donations grew, it became clear there was scope to share the money around.


  Barber told fans she wanted to distribute the money to other groups through her Instagram stories.

Voters in Minnesota will have some new options with this election year. One of those options is a presidential nomination primary, which takes place on March 3.
 In 2016, the state legislature passed a law that established a presidential nomination primary.
 As with any presidential election year, there will also be a precinct caucus on Feb. 25. The caucus allows voters to show their support for their preferred candidates.
 PRECINCT CAUCUSES
 According to the Minnesota Secretary of State, “a caucus is great way to show support for a candidate, raise an issue that’s important to you, influence who the party will endorse for many offices, and meet people in your community.”
 The 2020 precinct caucuses will be Tuesday, Feb. 25, at 7 p.m. at locations that will be set by the political parties. To find out more information, contact the DFL party at 651-293-1200 or the Republican party at 651-222-0022.
 To be eligible to participate in this year’s precinct caucus, a voter must be eligible to vote in the November general election and live in the precinct. Participants must also generally agree with the principals of the political party hosting the caucus.
 The Minnesota Secretary of State said that each political party run their caucus meeting a little differently, but there are generally three main activities at the caucus. The first is choosing volunteers who organize political activities in the precinct. Secondly, issues and ideas are discussed for the party to support. Finally, delegates are chosen who will endorse candidates at future conventions.
 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION PRIMARY
 The following week is the first presidential nomination primary March 3. Voters will be able to chose from a DFL ballot or a Republican party ballot to cast their votes. They will need to tell the election judge which ballot they want.
 The Republican party candidate includes current President Donald J. Trump. The DFL party candidates include: Michael Bennet, Joseph Biden, Michael R. Bloomberg, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, John K. Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Deval Patrick, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang and uncommitted.
 Candidates named mentioned will stay on the primary ballot even if a candidate drops out of the race.
 It is important to note that this primary will only be for presidential candidates from these two parties. “Other offices with a primary will be on the primary ballot on Aug. 11,” according the Minnesota Secretary of State.
 How does one voter participate in the nomination primary? A registered voter can place their vote at their polling place on March 3 or by absentee ballot between Jan. 17 and March 2. Maple Grove also allows in-person absentee voting at the government center, 12800 Arbor Lakes Parkway, as well as Osseo at city hall, 415 Central Ave., from Jan. 17 to March 2.
 The Secretary of State said, “A voter’s choice of party ballot will be recorded and is private data. However, a list of who voted in a presidential nomination primary and the political party each voter selected will be provided to the chair of each major political party. How a voter voted on the ballot will be secret.”
 HOW CITIES ARE MANAGING
 The cities of Maple Grove and Osseo have been working since the end of last year to prepare for the nomination primary.
 Maple Grove City Clerk Amy Dietl said that there isn’t too much difference in the way the city prepares for the nomination primary compared to other elections. The only difference is that specialized presidential nomination primary administration training is required. “City staff has already attended the Presidential Nomination Primary training at Hennepin County,” she said.
 Maple Grove city staff will be providing the additional nomination primary training to all election judges working on March 3. This training is in addition to the regular election judge training.
 “In terms of regular election judge training, the election judges who worked elections in 2018 still hold a valid election judge certification,” Dietl said. “New election judges who did not work during the 2018 election must also complete the election judge training course, in addition to the nomination primary training, prior to March 3.”

A rare bright light in the country’s dysfunctional democratic institutions, a publication that many Zambians must use and support, and an inspiring example of a free press and the future we want, News Diggers has demonstrated that fighting for what is good was not unique to The Post. Many Zambians would love to do that. They simply have no opportunity and see the risk as too great to their lives. It is worth pointing out that to be a journalist in Zambia is risky, less rewarding, and requires a lot of sacrifice. That is the more reason why the editors and reporters of News Diggers deserve praise for their inspiring passion, dedication, commitment to work and running the paper so well on a shoestring budget.
