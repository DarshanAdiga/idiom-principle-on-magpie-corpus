Once you retire, it’s harder to find excuses to put off unpleasant chores. So, on a rainy Monday morning, I gritted my teeth and set off for the Department of Revenue license bureau to apply for my Real ID. I’d need to have one to board a plane starting Oct. 1, and I wanted to beat the rush.
 I didn’t. It was standing room only in the waiting room, and practically everybody was there for Real ID. (It was a typical St. Louis crowd, good- humored and chatty.) I took a number and settled down to wait all morning.
 After 20 minutes or so, a clerk came out and announced some document standards that I had somehow overlooked on the website. A 1099 had to have your full social security number on it. If you lived in an apartment, any document you hoped to prove your address with had to have the apartment number. There was more fine print, and a lot of people left, realizing the papers they’d brought wouldn’t pass muster.

The Feds eventually muscled the states into line, but the public remains obdurate or ignorant. Pollsters estimate that more than half of Americans don’t even know about the Oct. 1 deadline. The U.S. Travel Association says it’s worried that airlines and hotels are going to lose a lot of business because their customers can’t get past TSA checkpoints. The TSA itself made an alarming announcement that as many as one million passengers wouldn’t make it to their planes on Oct. 1.
 We can expect the drumbeat to get louder as the deadline nears. Some state DMVs have already announced longer hours and are holding special registration events at airports.
 “People want it their way but they can’t always get it,” said the clerk who processed my documents. “It’s the law.” Is there any way to avoid applying for a Real ID?
 It might seem so. With your old driver’s license, you can keep on driving, and if you have a passport, you can get past the TSA. (If you don’t have one, though, remember that a passport is much more expensive than a Real ID.) But there are complicating factors.
 The Department of Homeland Security says you will need real ID to enter restricted Federal facilities, like its Washington office. Well, who wants to go there? But other restricted areas are military bases and nuclear power plants. That may be no problem for you. The list could get longer, though.
 My sources disagreed on what else you may need a Real ID to do. Pundits on both the left and right suspect that once Washington has established a national ID, its required uses will inevitably multiply. You’ll need it to enter a Federal courthouse or Social Security office. To board a train or bus. The conservative Cato Institute predicts that it will be required to pick up a prescription or buy guns and ammo. People without Real ID may find that a new line has been drawn and now they’re “undocumented individuals” — a frightening classification in Trump’s America.
 Some resisters are looking to Trump to save them. He likes the Real ID Act, because its other sections allow him to sweep aside regulations that hinder his border wall. But election day is only a month after the deadline, and some pundits predict he will postpone it to win more votes. Real ID will be a formidable barrier to immigrants, however, so I wouldn’t count on Trump, if he wins, to put off enforcement for long.

BARCELONA -- Barcelona would like an easy fix after last week's defeat to Real Madrid knocked them off the top of the table, but Saturday's La Liga fixture against a soaring Real Sociedad could be the last thing they need.
 The Basque side are on a remarkable run of six straight victories in all competitions and visit the Camp Nou fresh from qualifying for the Copa del Rey final for the first time in 32 years after overcoming Mirandes on Wednesday.
 Sociedad's rise this season was somewhat unexpected as they have the youngest team in the league, while coach Imanol Alguacil is in his first full season after spending most of his career in charge of the club's youth set up.
 Yet he has built one of the most exciting teams in the league, buttressed by midfielder Mikel Merino and playmaker Martin Odegaard, who has got his career back on track after a premature move to Real Madrid aged 16.
 They are led in attack by a rotating cast of free scoring forwards including Spain international Mikel Oyarzabal, Sweden striker Alexander Isak and former Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj plus Brazilian striker Willian Jose.
 Sociedad's recent barnstorming run has included a 4-3 away win over Real Madrid and a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Champions League Valencia, while playing a thrilling style of football based on slick passing that must have Barca looking on in envy.
 Ever since Pep Guardiola left in 2012 after producing one of the most mesmerizing teams in the game's history, Barca's style of play has been a subject of fierce debate, even as the club's silverware count has continued to rise.
 Concern that the team had abandoned its attacking philosophy led Barca to sack proven winner Ernesto Valverde in January and replace him with Quique Setien, who has never won a trophy but was seen to embody Barca's principles of possession football.
 The experiment has had mixed results, with the team certainly having more of the ball but looking less effective.
 Sunday's defeat in Madrid was their third loss in 11 games under Setien and now Real are in the driving seat in the title race, with Sunday's trip to Real Betis up next for Zinedine Zidane's side.
 Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid have a chance to return to the top four when they host third-placed Sevilla. (Reporting by Richard Martin Editing by Toby Davis)

Troubled Vodafone Idea has warned that the Indian telecom market may move towards a position of "virtual monopoly" if Trai does not intervene in tariff fixation, while Airtel has cited "huge existential and financial crisis" to bat for fixation of floor price for two years.
 Jio has termed the fixation of floor price for data services as "vital" for the health of telecom sector, and urged Trai to continue the policy of forbearance for voice services, which it said is the preferred telecom service of the subscribers at the bottom of the pyramid.
 Jio further said hike in floor price should be undertaken gradually and be fixed at Rs 15 per GB for now -- against the prevailing Rs 9 to 12 per GB -- and taken to Rs 20 per GB after six to nine months depending on the data consumption growth.
 In its recent submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Vodafone Idea -- confronted with Rs 53,000 crore in AGR dues, of which it has so far only paid 7 per cent -- flagged the "deep financial distress" in the telecom sector, reflecting in unprecedented decline in revenues.
 Over the last three years, half a dozen operators have exited by either merging their businesses with existing Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) or declaring bankruptcy, Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) rued.
 "If the existing financial stress in the sector is not addressed within a short period, it could result in further bankruptcy and exit of TSPs from the market, leading to a state of virtual monopoly and absence of fair competition in the market," VIL said in its written submission.
 The telco's comments were in response to Trai's consultation paper on 'Tariff Issues of Telecom Services'.
 Making a strong case for Trai intervention, the company said to address the current financial stress, floor price must be considered for pure data plans, metered data plans and bundled usage plans; and fixed subscription charges for voice only, data only or voice and data subscribers.
 Floor price should also be considered for unlimited usage plan on voice (say plan with 1,000 minutes limit) or data which will construe as a bundled plan; and off-net outgoing calls.
 "Subject to above, other services, including on-net voice may continue to be under forbearance," Vodafone Idea said.
 VIL said that among the telecom companies in the market, the public sector operator has been provided a significant financial assistance to sustain itself.
 In a commentary which clearly underlines extent of the crisis in the sector, VIL said there is a "very strong likelihood" of further exits in the Indian telecom sector, and therefore it is likely that India may move towards a position of virtual monopoly.
 Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel has said the industry is facing a huge existential and financial crisis, caused by cut throat competition due to 'below cost' pricing, and that operators have "bled".
 The operators have a choice of raising tariffs unilaterally to correct the situation, but that is "easier said than done" given the extremely competitive nature of the market.
 Airtel believes the industry needs an unprecedented intervention in terms of orderly conduct of the players.
 "The only way to realise this orderly conduct for now is through the fixation of floor tariffs," it said.
 Airtel said that after two years, however, the industry must go back to tariff forbearance.
 "Our recommendation is to therefore have a clear time bound floor price which migrates back to forbearance at the end of two years. We believe that once industry health is restored, the Indian consumer will be well served by the innovation that tariff forbearance naturally provides," it said.
 The Sunil Mittal-led company said the industry requires over Rs 1 lakh crore (excluding spectrum) in just 18-24 months to expand existing networks.
 "For operators to themselves act sensibly and raise tariffs is very difficult given the brutal competitive intensity. We therefore believe that a temporary intervention by TRAI for a two year period so as to ensure orderly conduct has become essential to restore a dying industry," Airtel said.
 The most critical need for the industry is to restore the financial health, Airtel said, adding that in its estimate even after the recent tariff hike of December 2019, the company will need an additional ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 80 for 15 per cent return on capital employed.
 It said that there should not be any specific floor price for voice and voice price may be kept under forbearance.
 "While we have recommended voice to be under forbearance, there are bundled packs which have unlimited voice. Hence, there will be a requirement to add a voice price component, in order to arrive at the overall floor tariff," Airtel said responding to Trai's question on whether there should be a limit on telcos to offer free off-net calls.
 Airtel has recommended including Rs 60 per month towards voice charges in case of bundled pack with unlimited voice.
 "No limit to be applied on TSPs to offer free off-net minutes. Any charging of calls, outside the unlimited bundle pack, may be left to the discretion of the operator given the broader over-arching recommendation of tariff forbearance on voice," it said.
 It has opposed any need for price ceiling, citing among other factors the competitive market.
 Jio, on the other hand, has said that fixation of floor price for data services is vital for maintaining the health of the telecom sector and delivering best value to Indian consumers.

With most results in as of Wednesday afternoon, it's safe to say  Sanders won a solid victory in California, which had the most pledged delegates up for grabs (415). But Biden wiped the floor with the other candidates, including Sanders, in a slew of other contests - particularly in southern states like Alabama and Arkansas. The former vice president came away with a sizable lead in pledged delegates (492), with Sanders trailing by roughly 60 (430), according to Decision Desk HQ.

If the name Hilma af Klint suggests a medieval abbess known for her ecstatic visions, you’ve got it half-right. The recently rediscovered Swedish artist lived from 1862 to 1944, but her life’s work was indeed driven by her efforts to contact ethereal presences. Growing up in an era when spiritualism was all the rage, she claimed from girlhood on to be clairvoyant and by 17 was conducting séances. She studied Theosophy and Rosicrucianism, and later Anthroposophy. With a group of young women friends who called themselves the Five, in the 1890s she began “communicating” with a roster of spirits they termed the High Masters, and af Klint claimed that they directed her hand when she was painting.

Troubled Vodafone Idea has warned that the Indian telecom market may move towards a position of &quot;virtual monopoly&quot; if Trai does not intervene in tariff fixation, while Airtel has cited &quot;huge existential and financial crisis&quot; to bat for fixation of floor price for two years.Jio has termed the fixation of floor price for data services as &quot;vital&quot; for the health of telecom sector, and urged Trai to continue the policy of forbearance for voice services, which it said is the preferred telecom service of the subscribers at the bottom of the pyramid.Jio further said hike in floor price should be undertaken gradually and be fixed at Rs 15 per GB for now -- against the prevailing Rs 9 to 12 per GB -- and taken to Rs 20 per GB after six to nine months depending on the data consumption growth.In its recent submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Vodafone Idea -- confronted with Rs 53,000 crore in AGR dues, of which it has so far only paid 7 per cent -- flagged the &quot;deep financial distress&quot; in the telecom sector, reflecting in unprecedented decline in revenues.Over the last three years, half a dozen operators have exited by either merging their businesses with existing Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) or declaring bankruptcy, Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) rued.&quot;If the existing financial stress in the sector is not addressed within a short period, it could result in further bankruptcy and exit of TSPs from the market, leading to a state of virtual monopoly and absence of fair competition in the market,&quot; VIL said in its written submission.The telco's comments were in response to Trai's consultation paper on 'Tariff Issues of Telecom Services'.Making a strong case for Trai intervention, the company said to address the current financial stress, floor price must be considered for pure data plans, metered data plans and bundled usage plans; and fixed subscription charges for voice only, data only or voice and data subscribers.Floor price should also be considered for unlimited usage plan on voice (say plan with 1,000 minutes limit) or data which will construe as a bundled plan; and off-net outgoing calls.&quot;Subject to above, other services, including on-net voice may continue to be under forbearance,&quot; Vodafone Idea said.VIL said that among the telecom companies in the market, the public sector operator has been provided a significant financial assistance to sustain itself.In a commentary which clearly underlines extent of the crisis in the sector, VIL said there is a &quot;very strong likelihood&quot; of further exits in the Indian telecom sector, and therefore it is likely that India may move towards a position of virtual monopoly.Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel has said the industry is facing a huge existential and financial crisis, caused by cut throat competition due to 'below cost' pricing, and that operators have &quot;bled&quot;.The operators have a choice of raising tariffs unilaterally to correct the situation, but that is &quot;easier said than done&quot; given the extremely competitive nature of the market.Airtel believes the industry needs an unprecedented intervention in terms of orderly conduct of the players.&quot;The only way to realise this orderly conduct for now is through the fixation of floor tariffs,&quot; it said.Airtel said that after two years, however, the industry must go back to tariff forbearance.&quot;Our recommendation is to therefore have a clear time bound floor price which migrates back to forbearance at the end of two years. We believe that once industry health is restored, the Indian consumer will be well served by the innovation that tariff forbearance naturally provides,&quot; it said.The Sunil Mittal-led company said the industry requires over Rs 1 lakh crore (excluding spectrum) in just 18-24 months to expand existing networks.&quot;For operators to themselves act sensibly and raise tariffs is very difficult given the brutal competitive intensity. We therefore believe that a temporary intervention by TRAI for a two year period so as to ensure orderly conduct has become essential to restore a dying industry,&quot; Airtel said.The most critical need for the industry is to restore the financial health, Airtel said, adding that in its estimate even after the recent tariff hike of December 2019, the company will need an additional ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 80 for 15 per cent return on capital employed.It said that there should not be any specific floor price for voice and voice price may be kept under forbearance.&quot;While we have recommended voice to be under forbearance, there are bundled packs which have unlimited voice. Hence, there will be a requirement to add a voice price component, in order to arrive at the overall floor tariff,&quot; Airtel said responding to Trai's question on whether there should be a limit on telcos to offer free off-net calls.Airtel has recommended including Rs 60 per month towards voice charges in case of bundled pack with unlimited voice.&quot;No limit to be applied on TSPs to offer free off-net minutes. Any charging of calls, outside the unlimited bundle pack, may be left to the discretion of the operator given the broader over-arching recommendation of tariff forbearance on voice,&quot; it said.It has opposed any need for price ceiling, citing among other factors the competitive market.Jio, on the other hand, has said that fixation of floor price for data services is vital for maintaining the health of the telecom sector and delivering best value to Indian consumers.&quot;We therefore submit that the data floor should be fixed on the basis of realized revenue from data services. As mentioned by the Authority, the realized revenue ranges from Rs 9 to 12 per GB. The authority should target to improve the realisation at least to Rs 20 per GB,&quot; Jio said.Floor should to be prescribed for data service for all categories -- that is corporate, consumer and segmented, it said.

Trump is going to be on the ballot on November 3 as the Republican candidate. And that fact alone makes us excited – very excited – deliriously excited – to endorse and vote for anyone who emerges from this Democratic primary and earns the nomination to oppose him. We will wait until then to remind you of the many reasons why this divisive, racist, dangerous man must be driven out of the White House by electing a Democrat. For now, we beg our readers to vote on March 10, to vote your conscience and your strategy for a win in November. But, once the Democratic Party has a nominee, if that nominee is not your candidate of choice, be prepared to vote for that candidate.
 We make a special appeal, here, to progressive white Democrats. Black Democrats across the spectrum are wearily accustomed to making do in November with a candidate we never would have chosen in the primary. We – who have the most to lose by the white nationalism that is rampant in the Trump White House – do not have the luxury or privilege of hurling rocks at the Democratic establishment if our favored, more progressive candidate does not advance to the general election. We, who have endured the most longtime hostility in America, realize that choosing the lesser of two evils is choosing less evil, which is a wise and strategic choice in the absence of another alternative.
 To be more specific, black voters are responsible for Joe Biden’s surge in the polls, at the expense of Bernie Sanders. If you are a progressive white Democrat, you may deride this support of a centrist candidate as propping up a moribund two-party system that continues to give us choices of candidates who are far from our ideals. However, dismantling the two-party system would mean, in 2020, destroying the Democratic Party, the only viable counterpoint to a Republican Party that has aligned itself behind a white nationalist who flouts the rule of law and endangers us all. However much Democrats may be fighting amongst themselves today, Black America has an appeal for all Democrats. Our very survival depends on ending Trump’s destructive behavior. Come November, please, love thy neighbor’s Democratic candidate as thine own.

The vaguely fake-looking dogs aren’t the worst part of _The Call of the Wild_ 2020\. Presumably in an appeal to the family-friendly movie market, this version pretty much sands off all the rough edges of the story. The violence of frontier life is markedly toned down, and even Buck’s epic battle with another dog, Spitz, for alpha status on the sled team is bloodless and does not end in the loser’s demise. The background photography (shot in Canada) is often gorgeous, but verisimilitude in life-or-death situations is treated as expendable. I think the author of “To Build a Fire” would have been appalled to see Thornton come out of a stretch of heavy whitewater with his sweater barely damp and not an inch of water in the bottom of his canoe, or the mail- sled captain Perrault (Omar Sy) being more worried about a dog’s whereabouts than the fact that his musher Françoise (Cara Gee) might die within minutes after a plunge into a frozen lake if he doesn’t get her into dry clothing stat.

Chris Sanders’ newly released _The Call of the Wild_ is a perfect example of a movie based on a childhood classic that should never have been made. Several big-screen versions already existed, including a 1923 silent film, a 1935 version starring Clark Gable and Loretta Young, another from 1972 with Charlton Heston, one with Rutger Hauer in 1997, an anime interpretation and another animated film starring Snoopy. Until now, the live-action ones at least featured real live dogs as Buck and his sled-teammates. The 2020 edition is neither fish nor fowl nor canine, with the dog and wolf characters rendered in CGI. Sadly, though the technology has advanced greatly in recent years, mammals still suffer from the Uncanny Valley effect – especially when they’re the focus of nearly every scene.

Perhaps predictably, considering that similar rumors were on the go during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, there’s fake news out there of late positing that the virulent Coronavirus strain now spreading across the globe was secretly cultivated in US government laboratories and deliberately released in China, with a view to devastating its economy. Apparently originating with a QAnon blogger, this rumor blew up in anti-vaxxer social media circles, and somehow led to speculation that Bill Gates and/or Hillary Clinton were behind the fiendish plan. Wacko conspiracy theories are, sadly, always an easy sell to a gullible American public.

A new trend shows more Americans want to die at home on their own terms surrounded by loved ones. The percentage of natural deaths at home is increasing, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, climbing from nearly 24% in 2003 to 30.7% in 2017. Natural deaths at hospice facilities also increased from .2 percent to 8 percent in that time period while natural deaths in hospitals and nursing facilities dropped.
 It's an understandable desire given clinical environments in our hospitals and normal human fears around dying. But making it happen is costly and not easy to achieve, especially for working families who may be asked to pay for round- the-clock care for their loved one.
 Last week, we asked New Englanders about their preferences around dying at home and if they think our health care system should support it. Not many of you answered, but the few who did spoke passionately about their experiences and opinions on the question. Read on for their responses and scroll below to answer this week's question on the coronavirus. Those that included their name are published below.
 This week's question looks at the U.S. response to the coronavirus, whether the right steps are being taken and how politics and economics might be playing a role. How happy are you with the U.S. response? What else do you think the government should be doing to keep Americans safe? Answer below or here. Responses will publish online on March 12.

 Is being able to die at home important to you? What are the benefits of providing terminal care in the home and how do we give individuals and families the support to do this?

 We just experienced this recently. My father was released to hospice care at home. The hospital was very good about contacting a hospice organization and having various medical equipment (hospital bed, oxygen, etc.) sent to the house. Hospice nurses will check in a couple of days a week. But because my dad needed 24 hour care we had to hire our own overnight and pt daily nurse, paid out of pocket. It was very stressful trying to figure out how long we'd be able to do this. On top of everything thing else going on, this was always in the back of our minds.
 The positives of our experience is that we found a way to make my father comfortable. Have conversations, make memories, discuss what his final wishes were and when he did finally pass, we were there, holding his hand.

 Being able to die at home is very important to me. Providing terminal care in the home helps to preserve the dignity of the individual. Often there is a measurable amount of fear that overtakes someone when they reach this point in their life. This is especially true when it is an unexpected illness. By staying within your own community and home some of this fear is eliminated. The sounds of the sick and broken are not wafting through the halls coupled with sterilizing chemical smells. Familiar surroundings, friends and loved ones can all help to dissuade some of those fears. By eliminating the stress of hospitalization the process can be less painful and could even prolong the individual's life a little as they enjoy their family. One program that is currently helping hundreds of Massachusetts residents stay home for their care is the Adult Foster Care program, or AFC. Preferred Residential Network out of Fall River is one provider of this service. MassHealth has been sponsoring this program and helping people get the health care they need but also made a way for those who wish to stay in their homes. Programs like this and Hospice programs can make passing away in your own home possible and possibly remove some of the overflow of hospital beds and the financial burden that goes along with keeping someone in the hospital until they pass. I would want to be home, in my own bed, with my family - not alone in a sterile environment, if possible.

 I want to die at home and have a home funeral for myself. Privacy and familiarity are the biggest reasons to provide terminal care at home. But cost and logistics make it nearly impossible. We need round the clock Medicare funded care options, not half an hour three days a week from a hospice nurse. We need to help family afford to do modifications to their home to accommodate wheelchair access or mechanical lift devices. Specially designed hospice homes are only offered to the more predictably terminally ill, usually young (not geriatric) cancer patients.
 My grandma has recently become wheelchair bound and while I am perfectly capable of caring for her and managing her medication, nutrition, social, and general well being I cannot be there to care for her 24/7/365. But it is cheaper to keep her in a skilled nursing facility than to hire part-time respite care for only 6 hours a day. That's not even enough time for me to go to work or to school. Her financial assets are too great for the state to pay for a caregiver, or to give me a stipend for quitting my job to care for her, but not great enough to afford the round the clock care for more than a couple months. Her wheelchair wouldn't even fit through her smaller-than-standard bedroom door at her assisted living facility apartment. Geriatric case manager guidance comes in at an average of $100/per hour. It is a better financial option for me to just take an unpaid day off from work and put in 6-7 hours of care coordinating, doctors office calling, and bill paying than to pay for someone else to do 40 minutes of googling and then 20 minutes of telling me what Google said. In this country, the way our healthcare is set up, only the rich can afford to die with dignity and comfort. In both dying and being dead. Grandmas preferred funeral home quoted me $9k for her funeral.. not including the casket, the church, the cemetery services, etc. She didn't want a home funeral and none of the places I talked to even supported them! Dying is for the rich. Period.

 I have been taking care of my mother since 2014 due to advanced dementia. Ahe promised me never to put her in a nursing home. Unfortunately I have had to spend all of my life savings just to continue paying for my home which I do not live in. mMy mother needs 24-hour care because she is totally dependent on me. It has cost over $1000000 since 2014. I spent countless hours every day trying to get some help from the system. Medicare has not been of any help since I have sent my Power of Attorney papers 3 times and they still state that they have not received any of the three power of attorney documents I sent to them in the past 3 years. I get no help from any other family members so I've had to rely on paying caregivers 12 hours a day and sometimes 24 hours a day just to get some sleep once or twice a week . I am truly disappointed that there are very few agencies that have the means to provide any kind of help that my mother needs therefore it relies on me alone to get the job done.

VANCOUVER - Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde says it's up to all Wet'suwet'en people to work through the draft agreement struck on Sunday between their hereditary chiefs and senior Canadian officials.
 The agreement is the result of four days of negotiations, held in response to the hereditary chiefs' opposition to the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern British Columbia that sparked solidarity protests and blockades across the country.
 A joint statement by representatives of Wet'suwet'en Nation, the province and the federal government acknowledged they had not come to an agreement on the pipeline, and the company was expected to resume its work this week.
 But they say the focus of the draft agreement is Wet'suwet'en rights and land title.
 Bellegarde says it's an opportunity to resolve unsettled issues dating back to a 1997 Supreme Court of Canada decision that recognized the hereditary chiefs' authority and the exclusive right of Wet'suwet'en peoples to the land, but fell short of recognizing the territorial boundaries.
 He says it's up to Wet'suwet'en people themselves to find the balance between hereditary chiefs and elected chiefs, which will take time, and those talks should include all those in the community.

To help curb further spread, health officials in New York have implemented mandatory self-quarantines for people who had close contact with those infected, which is about 1,000 people.  But families who are under quarantine have questioned how effective these measures are, since in some households one member might be obligated to stay home, while the others are free to move out and about.
