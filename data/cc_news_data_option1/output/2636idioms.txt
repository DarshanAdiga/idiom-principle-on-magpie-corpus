July 6 (Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he is struggling to understand why his team score so many goals and limit the opposition to so few chances but have still lost nine Premier League matches this season.
 City, who relinquished the league title to Liverpool, lost 1-0 at Southampton on Sunday despite dominating possession (73%) and peppering the Saints goal with more than 20 shots.
 Striker Che Adams sealed victory for 13th-placed Southampton and condemned City, who beat Liverpool 4-0 in their last game, to a third successive league defeat away from home.
 Champions Liverpool have lost twice in the league all season.
 "We're leading in goals. We create a lot of chances," said Guardiola, who lost a third straight away league game for the first time in his managerial career.
 "We're a team who concede less -- no team conceded as few chances as us but we lost a lot of games.
 "It's difficult even for me to find a reason why but you have to insist and talk about the game, the way they play and try to do more, concede as few as possible and score up front."
 Guardiola backed City to return to winning ways at home against Newcastle United on Wednesday.
 "I have confidence we can do it because we are the same guys and we did it in previous seasons," he added.
 "This season the way we are playing is quite similar but it is not enough to win the games." (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford )

July 6 (Reuters) - Liverpool are on course to beat Manchester City's mark of 100 points in a Premier League campaign but the champions are not focused on breaking records, manager Juergen Klopp has said.
 Liverpool, who won 2-0 at Aston Villa on Sunday thanks to goals by Sadio Mane and Curtis Jones, need 12 points from their final five games to beat City's tally from the 2017-18 season.
 "We didn't come here and have the numbers we have because we thought about breaking records. We were always focused 100% on the game and that will not change," said Klopp, whose side made it 17 wins out of 17 games at Anfield this season.
 "If we want to have record points pretty much we have to win all the games, it's not complicated. The boys know it and it's not necessary to mention it to this group."
 Liverpool next visit 15th-placed Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday. (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengalurul Editing by Peter Rutherford )

PRAGUE (AP) — A group volunteers in the Czech Republic was working round the clock to prevent critical shortage of ventilators for COVID-19 patients, something that happened in northern Italy. Led by Tomas Kapler, an IT expert who had nothing to do with lung ventilators before, a team of 30 developed a fully functional ventilator in just days. They secured the necessary finances through crowdfunding, approached a leading expert in the field with a request for help and gave him all possible support. Volunteer pilots delivered supplies while a company agreed to produce it. The crisis was contained in the Czech Republic, but the ventilator may save lives around the globe.

Few workers at the factory in Leicester were found to be wearing face masks to guard against the transmission of the coronavirus. There was also no evidence that social distancing measures had been implemented.
 ## Leicester lockdown
 Boohoo is already under fire after Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firm were "being forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19".
 At the time Boohoo said it would "not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance especially in relation to the treatment of workers within our supply chain".
 Leicester is currently under local lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases.
 At the weekend, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was "very worried about the employment practices in some factories" in the city.
 Sales at Boohoo, which trades exclusively online, has surged during the coronavirus lockdown with particular demand for loungewear and athleisure gear.
 The company recently bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse and earlier this year acquired MissPap, Karen Millen and Coast.
