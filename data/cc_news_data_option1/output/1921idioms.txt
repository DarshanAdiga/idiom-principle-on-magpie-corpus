The onus will be on banks to act in tandem to these measures and provide support. It is a great opportunity for a large section of the Indian entrepreneurs to seize the moment and build momentum. One can't predict the timing and the frequency of any relapse but one can definitely be self- conscious and not end-up becoming an inadvertent carrier, eventually a victim of the illness.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said on Friday it has sold much of its stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc, despite the billionaire's assurance that the banking sector was not a "primary worry" for him during the coronavirus pandemic.
 In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of March 31, Berkshire said its Goldman stake fell 84% to 1.9 million shares, from 12 million at year-end, with the stake's market value dropping to $297 million from $2.76 billion.
 Goldman's stock price fell about 33% during the quarter, and some of Berkshire's selling appears to have occurred after the slide began.
 Berkshire sold its remaining small stakes in the insurer Travelers Cos and oil refiner Phillips 66, and tweaked several holdings. Its stake in Wells Fargo & Co was unchanged, though the stock's price fell 47%.
   
   
 A request for comment to Buffett's assistant was not immediately returned. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and its namesake energy business.
 Investors monitor Berkshire's quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs see value. Buffett normally directs larger investments such as Apple Inc.
 The Goldman stake originated in a $5 billion preferred stock investment at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, in a vote of confidence by Buffett for the Wall Street bank.
 Berkshire's selling was disclosed after Buffett said at the May 2 annual shareholders' meeting of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate that banks were now well-capitalized and capable of weathering economic distress from the pandemic.
 "If problems become severe enough in an economy, even strong banks can be under a lot of stress, and we'll be very glad we've got the Federal Reserve system standing behind them," he said.
 "Overall the banking system is not going to be the problem," he added. "They are not a primary worry of mine at all."
 Berkshire remains a major shareholder in American Express , Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon , JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.
 Maeve DuVally, a Goldman spokeswoman, declined immediate comment.
 Doug Kass, managing partner at Seabreeze Capital Investment Inc, called the Goldman stock sale "not surprising," following Berkshire's sale of 6.3 million Goldman shares in the fourth quarter.
 Berkshire ended March with a record $137.3 billion of cash, disappointing investors unhappy with the low yields it generates for the company. The cash stake likely rose in April as Berkshire sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.

“I make coffee and sandwiches, bake pies, water the flowers, planted seeds, you-name-it; I love it,” she explained. “I’ve been doing it for two years, and I have to say I love the people I work with and the customers. You get to know them all, and call them by their first name when they walk in.
 “I’m also coping (with the cancellation) by spending a lot of time with my family, and I’m doing some running with my dogs, Odin, Thor and Bubba, and I’ve been hitting off a tee. At home with the family, we cook a lot, and my cousin and godson live right down the street, so we visit a lot with them, too.”
 This current situation also gives her more time to concentrate on finishing her high school obligations and prepare for the next step – attending Rhode Island College and chasing (to no great surprise) a major in pediatric nursing.
 “I just love helping kids,” Oliveira offered. “I want to be there for them when they’re going through something serious, or something troublesome. I want to be the someone who helps them forget about it, makes it OK again. I’ve always wanted to be in the medical field since I was a little girl, but it’s only been the last couple of years I’ve really focused in on pediatrics.”
 Ironically, she will not try to walk on the Anchormen’s varsity softball squad.
 “Throughout my entire softball career, and I started playing when I was six, I always though I’d play in college; I definitely wanted to, at least up until the last year or so,” she said. “I thought I could, and I still do, but then I started thinking, ‘I have to focus on school, especially with such a difficult major.’
 “It would just be too much; learning nursing is so difficult.”
 Again, the voice of reason speaks.
 “Coming into this season, I just wanted to have a great season, win some games and have fun,” she stated. “I wanted to make sure first and foremost we had a good, happy, spirited atmosphere, a good, collective attitude going in, and obviously, we wanted to make the playoffs. We made them and lost the previous two years, so we wanted to move further on (in the state tourney).
 “It wasn’t so much about wins and losses as atmosphere, though.”
 Ask her fondest memory of playing softball, and she doesn’t hesitate. It’s got nothing to do with a particular gritty victory but instead togetherness.
 “It’s got to be the bus rides to and from our away games over the past three years,” she said. “It was our bond, our camaraderie. Ever since freshman year, Makayla Chandler and I have shared the same seat on the bus – we’ve been best friends since second grade – and we’ll joke around, sing some after we win.”
 When asked what they do after a defeat, she chuckled and replied, “Sing quieter, and the songs are more sad. It’s all just to try to keep our heads up, and to be proud of the effort. That’s what I’ll miss most.”

The Cyber & Jihad Lab monitors, tracks, translates, researches, and analyzes cyber jihad originating from the Middle East, Iran, South Asia, and North and West Africa. It innovates and experiments with possible solutions for stopping cyber jihad, advancing legislation and initiatives federally – including with Capitol Hill and attorneys-general – and on the state level, to draft and enforce measures that will serve as precedents for further action. It works with leaders in business, law enforcement, academia, and families of terror victims to craft and support efforts and solutions to combat cyber jihad, and recruits, and works with technology industry leaders to craft and support efforts and solutions.
