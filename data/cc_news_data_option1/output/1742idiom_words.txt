It can be overwhelming, even for the mental health professionals tasked with easing such problems.
 “Never have I ever gone through a trauma at the same time as my clients,” said Melissa Nesle, a psychotherapist in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. “All I am hearing all day, hour after hour, is what I am experiencing also.”
 At points, Nesle added, the situation has made patients reluctant to unburden themselves. “They are aware to some extent that I am sitting in a New York City apartment, too,” she said. “So I will say to them, ‘Yes, this is really stressful; I feel you; I hear it.’ But I want to reassure them that I am OK.”
 She added, “I am not always.”
 Facing the deluge of patient need, the city’s health professionals have scrambled to adapt. Emergency legislation enacted by Congress in early March has expanded some psychologists’ ability to provide telehealth treatment to adhere to social distancing requirements. Some hold remote sessions in parked cars and even closets to maintain client confidentiality from their own sequestered household.
