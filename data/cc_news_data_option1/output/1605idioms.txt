On 17 July 1985, the village of Karamchedu woke up to a shocking massacre, when an entire Madiga settlement was attacked by a mob of Kamma men (a land- owning community closely associated with the then ruling Telugu Desam Party). In broad daylight, Kamma men armed with axes and spears chased and brutally attacked the community, killing six men and three women. While the attack is a black day in the history of Andhra Pradesh, it was neither the first nor the last attack on Dalits and minorities. Even while the wounds were fresh, distinctly similar attacks took place in Chunduru, Neerukonda, Pippara, and Timmasamudram.

But nothing could ever hurt more than knowing COVID-19 would prevent him from completing his high school career, canceling his senior season.
 "I was in the car, going on a trip with my girlfriend," Walls said.
 "I think somebody saw it on Twitter," Walls's girlfriend Sydney Stewart said. "And so they let them know that way. And I remember him breaking down and he was crying and trying to hide it from people.”
 "Just really, I was heartbroken," Walls said.
 "He actually has three little brothers that he was going to get to play ball with this year," Webster's father Nathan Walls said.
 "We talked about it a whole lot," Webster Walls said of his brothers. "We've always went to practice together and everything, but actually being able to be on a team be in the dugout for each other supporting each other..."
 "It was heartbreaking for all of us," Nathan Walls said. "It would be neat to have photos where they're all in uniform."
 Instead of him sitting at home though, Stewart had an idea for her goal-driven boyfriend.
 "He was talking about how much he was going to achieve this year and all the records he was going to break," Stewart said.
 "Last year I had a really big season, I hit seven home runs," Webster Walls said. "I wanted to hit a home run at every school I went to through my high school career."
 "I didn't want to take that away from him or let it take it away from him," Stewart said.
 So she's taking him to every one of those schools. The duo gets permission from each institution's athletic director to use their baseball field, finds a pitcher and clears for takeoff.

The country even reported a surplus (a positive current account balance) of $99 million in October 2019, before slipping back in to the negative zone, but the current account deficit narrowing is seen by analysts as a giant leap forward into fiscal year 2020. However, experts still remain skeptical about the sustainability of the export-led improvement because the reduction in the current account came on the back of import restrictions, which may not be a good policy in the long-term. To reduce the deficit, Pakistan has to _grow_ its exports, and choke its imports, they say.

China is in the throes of a multibillion-dollar splurge on new football stadiums, ramping up ambitions to be a superpower in the sport and host a World Cup as early as 2030.
 The building spree is taking place despite the coronavirus pandemic which has brought much of the world to a standstill, ravaging economies and putting live sport on hold.
 But with the outbreak receding in China, where it emerged in December, Chinese Super League (CSL) champions Guangzhou Evergrande last week began construction on their 12 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) new home.
 With a capacity of 100,000, the lotus flower-shaped stadium will for a time trump Barcelona's Camp Nou -- which is set for expansion -- as the world's biggest football arena, once it is completed by the end of 2022.
 Evergrande Group, a major property developer founded by one of China's richest men, said it also intends to build two more 80,000-seater stadiums in China.
 The country will have at least 12 major new football stadiums two years from now, said the state-run Southern Metropolis Daily, calling it "a new era for Chinese football".
 Most will be used for the newly expanded 2021 Club World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, but President Xi Jinping has his eyes on the biggest prize of all.
 "I think China's desire to apply for the World Cup is very clear," said Ji Yuyang, a journalist for the Oriental Sports Daily.
 Ji said it was a matter of when, not if, China bids.
 FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in June that he would welcome a Chinese bid to stage the 2030 World Cup, the next one up for grabs.
 \- Fit for a World Cup final -
 Guangzhou Evergrande's new stadium made headlines because of its vast scale and bold design.
 But it jarred because most sport in the world is shut down and economies, including China's -- the second largest -- are reeling from coronavirus.
 Moreover, Guangzhou is not holding Asian Cup games and the stadium will not be ready for the Club World Cup, even though the tournament is poised to be put back from the summer of 2021 because of the pandemic.
 Critics also queried why a club that averages about 50,000 for home matches needs such a big arena.
 "I think Evergrande may have two considerations. First, a 100,000-seat stadium might come in handy if China hosts a World Cup final or opening ceremony," said Ji.
 "Another point is that Evergrande will be able to make a statement by saying that they have the largest professional football stadium in the world, with the largest number of spectators."
 Most stadiums currently used by Chinese football teams were built for multiple sports. They are falling into disrepair and facilities for fans are poor.
 Replacing them with gleaming, football-specific arenas fits with Xi's master plan to transform the sport in the country on and off the pitch.
 \- 'Soft power of stadiums' -
 In Shanghai, which has ambitions of holding the Olympics, a 33,000-seat stadium for CSL side Shanghai SIPG is scheduled to be finished next year.
 Shanghai Stadium, the biggest arena in the city and SIPG's former home, is also undergoing major renovation.
 Ji said that while the Evergrande Group were likely paying for Guangzhou's new stadium, in some other instances it was a combination of the club and local government.
 Professor Simon Chadwick said that aside from China's World Cup aspirations, the rush on new stadiums sends a message that "China is developing and becoming healthier and stronger.
 "There's something about the iconography and symbolism of the stadiums, particularly the Guangzhou development," said Chadwick, director of the Centre for the Eurasian Sport Industry at Emlyon Business School.
 "This is a huge stadium, incredibly striking design, pictures of it have been carried across the world and people are commenting on it across the world.
 "It's almost the soft power of stadiums. China is trying to use these hugely distinctive stadium designs as a way of attracting people and attention, of getting people to understand that China wants the same things that other countries want."

Chris Corrie remembers the first athletic booster club night that Van Horn High School had when it joined the Independence School District.
   
 The staff outnumbered the parents at the sparse, first meet-the-coaches outing.
   
 "Hardly any of the parents showed up, but one of our parents - who did so much early on for Van Horn - Darrell Driskell, brought some hats and shirts and sweatshirts with our school logo on them," Corrie recalled. "I don't know how excited the parents were, but we were sure excited. Before that, you couldn't find anything with our school logo. That was the start - and look how far we've come. It's pretty amazing."
   
 That was 2008 and Corrie was a pioneer of sorts.
   
 Just ask Van Horn High School Principal Justin Woods.
   
 "Chris is absolutely a pioneer," said Woods, "because he is one of the few remaining members of the staff who were here at Van Horn when it became a part of the Independence School District.
   
 "Honestly, I don't know what we'd do without Chris. Whenever anyone has a question about the school, they ask Chris, and he has the answer."
   
 Corrie was a soccer coach at Van Horn when it was taken over by the Independence School District. There was no student council, no music or theater department - none of the activities that are such an important part of the Falcons' curriculum now.
   
 Corrie laughs when he thinks back to the days when his team practiced on a "40-by-40 piece of dirt."
   
 "So, Dr. Woods calls me a pioneer," the activities director said, chuckling. "I guess I am, at least here at Van Horn. Looking back at the past 12 years there have been so many changes - and all for the good."
   
 Van Horn is the home to an 1,800-square-foot culinary school that is part of the district's ISD Academies programs.
   
 The Falcons have a new fieldhouse that ranks with any in the state, a turf field and their success on the playing field and in the classroom has been well documented, including a state final four appearance by Jesus Rodriguez's boys soccer team.
   
 And now Corrie and the staff at Van Horn are doing all they can to help students - especially seniors - navigate the choppy waters of the COVID-19 stay-at-home order.
   
 "It's been different, it's been difficult, especially not seeing the students every day," Corrie said. "We now have to communicate with social media. That is becoming the new norm.
   
 "Emails, phone calls, Zoom - we're doing it all for our kiddos and we want them to know that we are always here for them. We might not be here face to face, but we are here and we are always thinking about them."
   
 While he longs to get back to school with all his students, he especially wants some more face time with the seniors.
   
 "The seniors have lost so much, and we are going to do everything we can to honor them," Corrie said. "The Missouri State High School Activities Association recently relaxed its restrictions during the summer, but I don't want to raise anyone's expectations of spring sports being played in the summer."
   
 The MSHSAA Board of Directors voted to make its summer dead period and summer limits on contact optional for 2020, though any activities would first need to be approved by local, state and national health officials.
   
 The decision removes the restriction of teams being allowed only 20 days of contact during the summer months.
   
 The chance of possibly getting to play or get together with the teams this summer thrills Corrie.
   
 "We'd love to see it happen, but a lot of things would have to fall into place, but there is always hope," he said.
   
 When he's not contacting students, doing social media chats with coaches, teachers and administrators, Corrie and his wife Jana, ISD's director of public relations, are home working with their kindergartner Roen and second grader Jonathan on their school work.
   
 "I love it," Corrie said. "If there is one silver lining in all of this, it is that so many families - including ours - get to spend more time at home with each other.
   
 "Jana and I really enjoy working with our boys. I think they really like it when I'm their playground supervisor, because that means it's time for their favorite class - PE."

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong students began taking university entrance examinations Friday with masks, temperature checks and social- distancing measures in place after a one-month delay. More than 52,000 students are expected to sit for the city’s Diploma of Secondary Education examinations, which are used for university admissions. All examination candidates and testing personnel were required to wear surgical masks and sanitize their hands. Students underwent temperature checks and had to sign health declaration forms before entering the testing venues, where desks were spaced at least a meter (yard) apart. The exams will take place until May 25. They were to start in March 27 but were postponed as virus infections rose in Hong Kong. Global examinations such as the International Baccalaureate exam originally slated in May, as well as Cambridge’s International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams in the U.K., have been cancelled. As of Thursday, Hong Kong has had 1,036 coronavirus infections with four reported deaths. After coronavirus cases surged in China in January, Hong Kong took several measures to limit the outbreak in the semi-autonomous territory. The city's schools have been closed since Jan. 25. Infections surged in March as overseas residents returned to Hong Kong while the pandemic was spreading in Europe and the United States. But the city's cases have dwindled this month, with 12 consecutive days of single-digit infections. However, social-distancing measures are still in place until at least May 7. Public gatherings of more than four people are banned, and certain businesses, like beauty salons, bars and karaoke venues remain closed. Restaurants are allowed to operate at half their usual capacity with tables spaced apart.

 Karen Sue Weber September 3, 1945-April 22, 2020 CLINTON, IA- KAREN SUE WEBER 74, of Andover, IA, died Wednesday, April 22, 2020 at Prairie Hills at Clinton, after a courageous twenty year battle with Parkinson's Disease. There will be a private family service with interment at the Leon Cemetery in Prophetstown, IL. The Fulton Chapel of the Bosma-Renkes Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements. A memorial has been established. Karen was born on September 3, 1945 in Clinton, IA, to John A. and Jeannette (Klooster) Wilkens. She was raised on the farm in rural Albany and Newton Townships in Illinois, and was educated in the Newton Township Grade School. She graduated from Erie High School in Erie, IL and attended Milwaukee Career College for dental assisting in Milwaukee, WI. She later received an Associate's Degree in Business from Mount Saint Clare College in Clinton. Karen married Paul Buddy Weber Jr. on March 4, 1966 at Newton Zion Reformed Church in Erie, IL. She did babysitting in her home for several years before going to work at the Job Corp in the former Schick Army Hospital in Clinton, where she taught dental assisting to young ladies. She worked as a dental assistant for several years for Dr. Cooper, Dr. Cherveny and Dr. Beardsley, all of Clinton. She was employed at Agri-King, Inc. in Fulton for 26 years, retiring as the Assistant Director of the Ration Department.

She could prepare a delicious meal on a moment's notice with whatever was available to her at the time. Her home was always open for a meal, dinner, or gathering of any kind. She loved to serve others and be around people, but never to be the center of attention. Survivors include her husband and dedicated care giver, Paul; two sons, Brian (Amy) Weber of Derby, KS and Bradley (KaCee) Weber of Camanche, IA; six grandchildren, Nick, Josh, Brianna, Tanner, Dalton & Annika; one great grandchild, Everleigh; one sister, Mrs. Joyce Wiersema of Fulton, IL; one brother, Robert (Shelia) Wilkens of Fulton, IL.

Muslims across the world began marking the holy month of Ramadan under unprecedented coronavirus lockdowns on Friday as the US added another half a trillion dollars to its already-massive support package to help its pandemic- ravaged economy.
 The virus has upended life around the planet as nations try to stop the spread of the disease that has so far claimed nearly 190,000 lives, infected close to 2.7 million people and hammered the global economy.
 Ramadan spirits have been dampened by movement restrictions in Muslim communities from Southeast Asia to the Middle East and Africa, with bans on prayer in mosques and large gatherings of families and friends to break the daily fast -- a centrepiece of the month.
 But despite the coronavirus threat, clerics and conservatives in many countries including Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia -- the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation -- have pushed back against social distancing rules, refusing to stop prayer gatherings in mosques.
 Several thousand people attended evening prayers on Thursday at the biggest mosque in the capital of Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province, and there were similar scenes at many sites in Pakistan.
 The World Health Organization has called for a stop to some Ramadan activities to lower the risk of infections, and authorities in several countries have explicitly warned of the threat from large religious gatherings.
 There have already been explosions of coronavirus cases from three separate Islamic congregations in Malaysia, Pakistan and India since the virus first emerged late last year in China.
 Distancing measures and the severe economic impact of the pandemic has also meant many charitable activities during Ramadan, especially food distribution and other donations, have been hit hard.
 Salah Jibril, an unemployed Palestinian man who lives with his wife and six children in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in the Gaza Strip, said he was not sure how his family would cope without Ramadan donations.
 "The markets and mosques are closed. The good people who give us money or aid each Ramadan are facing a tough situation," he said.
 "This is the hardest Ramadan we have faced. We don't know how we will cope."
 \- Massive economic stimulus -
 The economic devastation wreaked by lockdowns that have half the planet indoors is huge, with the world facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
 US lawmakers covered their faces with masks and voted in small groups to approve a $483 billion stimulus plan, on top of the $2.2 trillion package already enacted.
 The money will back small businesses on the brink of bankruptcy, and hard- pressed hospitals, as the American economy reels with more than 26 million people losing their jobs since the pandemic hit.
 The United States is now the worst-affected nation in the world, with about 50,000 coronavirus deaths.
 In Europe, leaders haggled by video conference over their own package that could top one trillion euros, as the European Central Bank chief warned of the risk of "acting too little, too late".
 The 27-nation European Union agreed to ask the bloc's executive arm to come up with a rescue plan by May 6, sources told AFP.
 The fight has reopened the wounds of the 2009 economic crisis in debt-laden European southern states such as Spain and Italy, both badly hit by the pandemic, demanding help to get back on their feet.
 Richer northern countries like Germany and the Netherlands say they are ready to help for now, but insist they will not pool debt with Mediterranean governments they accuse of profligacy.
 \- Race for vaccine -
 While the disease appears to be peaking in Europe and the United States, other nations are still in the early stages of the fight.
 The World Health Organization has warned that strict measures should remain until there is a viable treatment or vaccine.
 The race is on around the world to develop one, with Oxford University launching a human trial of a potential vaccine on Thursday. Germany announced similar trials will start by next week.
 In a briefing at the White House, scientists said they had found that the virus was quickly destroyed by sunlight, raising hopes that the pandemic could ease as the northern hemisphere summer approaches.
 "Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both surfaces and in the air," said William Bryan, science and technology adviser to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
 Their findings, however, have not yet been released and therefore not reviewed by independent experts.
 The rapid pace of development efforts is in part down to the vast numbers of patients that have overwhelmed healthcare systems in the developed world and in poorer countries.
 In Brazil, where intensive care units at hospitals have been slammed, Dr Fernanda Gulinelli said this "is a new chapter in medicine that we are having to write on the go, and we don’t know what the next sentence will be".

 Stanley Erle Tucker passed away peacefully, while reading a book, at his home on Easter Sunday. The youngest of eight children to John and Jessie Beitikofer Tucker, Stan was born in Santa Barbara on June 25, 1928. Attending local schools, he was raised in a loving household to be a confident, hands on person. His passion was auto mechanics, but he also learned early in adolescence how to lay plumbing, wire homes, and conduct any manner of household repairs. He helped his father pour foundations for relocated houses on the family acreage on the Mesa, between Fellowship Rd and Meigs Rd. during the early years of WWII. At the age of 16, Stan worked the summer in the Boeing factory in Santa Barbara, before taking a sabbatical from Santa Barbara H.S. On his 17th birthday he enlisted in the Merchant Marines, and before the summers end, was in the Pacific on an oiler, sailing around the world. He and his close buddies from Santa Barbara saw post war Japan, the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Not many 17 yr. olds can boast of steering a 500 ft ship through moonlit waters, with no running lights, to avoid being detected by Japanese subs the final weeks of the war. This adventure of a lifetime was just the beginning, as he finally returned home to start a new chapter of his life. Stan graduated SBHS in 1947. He then join a fishing boat crew, working the Santa Barbara Channel waters. Back then, they rigged for whatever was running in season, deploying crab pots, fish nets, fishing lines, and even occasionally harpooning swordfish from the prow. For many years, Stan raced motorcycles locally. He gave up racing at an early age to focus on his family and career. But he maintained lifelong friendships and met weekly at Harrys Plaza with several surviving members of the Santa Barbara Motorcycle club. At the age of 20, Stan started his 37 year career with So Cal Gas Co, rising from ditch digger to garage mechanic to lead mechanic in just a few years. In his 30's he was transferred to an office job at the So Cal Gas Patterson office complex. Soon he was promoted to Head of the Tri Counties fleet maintenance. He rewrote their entire maintenance program, overseeing the purchase and maintenance of every motor driven vehicle, from backhoes to field trucks to executive sedans. Stan was an avid golfer, and enjoyed many outdoor activities. He designed and built a collapsible camping trailer, taking the family on several memorable outings to Yosemite, Kings Canyon and the Sequoias. He retired at age 57, in 1986, with a pension, a stock portfolio and a paid off home in Hope Ranch annex. He approached retirement with the same intelligent, logic driven work ethic that he applied to his work. Stan hand crafted dozens of high quality musical instruments from scratch over the ensuing years. He turned down many high dollar offers for them. Instead, asking only for the cost of materials, he supplied instruments to several well known musicians, two of whom appeared on the Grand Old Opry. His reason for refusing to profit was simple, saying I didn't want to go into business. That would take the fun out of it. He was self taught, yet attained the highest level of woodworking imaginable. Stanley Tucker will be remembered for his unflinching sense of ethics and justice, and his utter lack of pretense or self promotion. He taught others by example, never preaching, and lived each day with joy and purpose. With his passing, Stanley was preceded by his wife of 66 years, Marion Doris Kapp Tucker in 2015, and his 7 siblings, Robert, John, Helen, Viola, Mary, Glen & Kenneth. He is survived by his son Michael Tucker and daughter Linda Tucker. Services will be private.

There's something to be said for a nice, slow burn. However, this approach requires enough character development to keep viewers intrigued while they wait for stuff to go down. That's where _Defending Jacob_ 's eight-episode structure does it no favors. The project holds itself out, according to the synopsis, as a "character-driven thriller," but it actually gets wrapped up in holding necessary details back for so long that it squishes its own character development.

A Budapest care home ravaged by the novel coronavirus has become a frontline in an escalating battle between Prime Minister Viktor Orban, emboldened by new emergency powers, and Hungary's beleaguered opposition.
 Orban and the Budapest municipality, run by a liberal mayor, blame each other for a COVID-19 outbreak that has infected at least 284 residents at the elderly care home operated by the capital.
 Of them, 28 residents have died so far, more than 10 percent of Hungary's 239 COVID-19 deaths to date.
 Orban has insisted his government can handle the coronavirus crisis without the opposition, a strategy that analyst Daniel Hegedus says consolidates the 56-year-old's already tight grip on power but also carries risks.
 "A potential serious mismanagement of the pandemic poses a threat to Orban," Hegedus told AFP.
 A powerplay between the nationalist premier and the opposition has intensified after parliament, dominated by the ruling Fidesz party, last month approved the "coronavirus defence bill" granting Orban powers to rule by decree without a fixed time limit.
 With around 2,300 cases, 9.8-million-strong Hungary's infection rate is low compared to countries in western Europe, in part thanks to relatively early lockdown restrictions.
 But it also has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe among those infected -- more than 10 percent –- and the second lowest testing rate, according to OECD data.
 Reports also persist of shortages of protective equipment for health workers and inadequacies in the kit they have despite regular government announcements of millions of items arriving from China.
 Although the government admits that more people are carrying the virus than are registered, it dismisses criticism of its approach, including evacuating half the country's 66,000 hospital beds to be ready in case COVID-19 infection numbers surge.
 "The government's narrative is that only Orban can save the country," said Robert Laszlo, analyst with the think-tank Political Capital.
 "So they need scapegoats -- the opposition, municipalities -- if anything goes wrong," he said.
 \- 'Lied through their teeth' -
 What happened at the Budapest care home remains murky.
 According to the government-appointed chief medical officer, no doctor was present at the care home for at least a week, and Orban has hinted at legal action in the future against the city.
 Blaming the deaths on the mayor, an ironically-toned Facebook post from a Fidesz politician said "Thank you Gergely Karacsony".
 The usually mild-mannered mayor alleges his accusers have "lied through their teeth" and that the chief medical officer has been forced to "play a political role".
 Karacsony claims a doctor was always present and has published documents he says prove the state failed to provide the facility with adequate testing and protective equipment.
 He has also joined 41 other non-Fidesz mayors in pleading in an open letter to Orban for more testing at care homes, especially of residents returning from hospital checks.
 \- Financial squeezes -
 Since October the government has ratcheted up financial and administrative squeezes on Budapest and other municipalities.
 Opposition parties joined forces then to propel Karacsony to a surprise win and also take mayoralties in 10 of the 23 main regional cities.
 Now during the lockdown Orban has decreed that parking nationwide should be free and ordered municipalities to transfer some tax revenues to an emergency fund, both measures depriving them of significant monies.
 An analyst with the Nezopont think-tank Agoston Mraz, however, points out that many municipalities hit with the orders are Fidesz-run.
 "It suits the opposition to play a victim role ahead of the 2022 general election," he told AFP.
 Another crisis measure removing decision-making powers from municipalities was dropped the same day it was unveiled, reportedly after protests from Fidesz mayors.
 But another government decree last week targeted only the opposition-run town of God, just outside Budapest, transferring taxes from a Samsung electronics plant there to the Fidesz-run county council.
 The government says the move will help create jobs at the plant, now designated a "special economic zone," but God mayor Csaba Balogh called the loss of revenue a "death sentence" for the town.
 Budapest will soon be on the "brink of bankruptcy," Karacsony has also warned.
 "Stripping the municipalities and opposition parties of power and resources on the one hand, and scapegoating them for any tragedies is a delicate balancing act," said analyst Hegedus.

 Claudia Wright VALPARAISO, IN - Our Mom, Claudia Wright, had a heart of gold, though she sometimes made you work a little to figure it out. It didn't take the same effort to realize her deepest joy - her four boys, who she raised by herself, and the grandchildren who followed in their first steps. Each time she visited her older grandchildren in Peru, IN, her excitement surged at the same point of the trip - just past the big hill to their home. When her grandson, Eric, battled a brain tumor, she drove to Indianapolis every weekend with her dog, Schotzie, to see him, and to be alongside her son. On her 79th birthday, February 1st of this year, she lovingly cradled her great grandson for hours. Becoming a grandmother of 12 and a great-grandmother of six only intensified her original maternal love. For more than 30 years, her love and joy never faded. Stubborn is the best word to describe her personality. She did things her way, even if it meant gentle appeasement with a little white lie. At the hospital, nurses wrongly thought she was 80. Her family told staff that she lied to get her driver's license early so she could get into bars as a young woman. Because she didn't want her sons to drink too early in life, she lied about her age to get a job earlier than expected. Our Mom never wanted anyone to worry, especially her children. When she finally agreed to visit an emergency room - after no longer being able to fight COVID-19 on her own, or hide it from her family - she warned one of her sons about the deadly virus. Wash your hands and don't touch your face, she told him while gasping to catch her breath. She was a strong woman, working hard just to get by during a challenging era for a divorced woman with four kids in the 1980's. She once lost a job although she performed it dutifully, simply because her bosses wanted a man, not a woman. Yet she persisted. It made her stronger. Those who knew her well would hold their breath when someone crossed her, fearing what wrath she would unleash. She eventually found her professional calling at BRIDGES, followed by a career at TradeWinds Services for the last 30 years, where she proudly worked as a case manager. She loved her TradeWinds family, both her colleagues and consumers. Our family thanks nurse Joanie for watching over her for us. Her oldest son is Donn (Susan) Taylor, followed by Robert (Lynn) Taylor, Sean (David Gilbert) Taylor, and Kevin Taylor. Her beloved daughter-in-law, Mary Cahillane, never stopped being her guardian angel. Our Mom often said when she arrives in heaven the only angels she wants to reunite with are her parents, Lloyd and Lorraine Hipp, and her grandson, Eric, who we lost when he was only 11. I have to make up for lost time, she would say. Our mom had so many crazy sayings (which she adamantly denied ever saying), such as Money doesn't grow on trees and Do you want me to stand on my head and spit golden nickels? and Your ass sucks buttermilk through a straw. Just as we'll never figure out that last one, we will never figure out why we lost her too soon.Life isn't fair she often told us. Regrettably, she was right. Our Mom passed away April 17, 2020. Instead of adorning her death with flowers, we ask you to adorn her memory with a donation to ( stjude.org ) in honor of Eric Taylor, her cherished grandson. She also requested, for the sake of mankind, to make sure that the idiot is not re-elected as U.S. president. For those who knew her, you could probably hear her voice saying this. We will have a celebration of her life, despite her probable disapproval. We will announce a date when it is safe, which she will approve of.

ADAMS — The owner of Field of Dreams Genetics Corp. here is taking a bullish attitude when it comes to helping dairy farmers and the downturn they’re experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The company, owned by Gary R. Tubolino, is providing bull semen at no cost to farmers who wish to get a cow bred. The three-month offer began early this month.
 In the brawny business world of bull semen, it’s all about numbers, names and results. Specifically in the case of these donations, Mr. Tubolino is providing the semen from bulls 91H4629 Alabama, 91H4602 Apache, 6H4283 Antonio, 91H4408 Gusto, 6H0075 Lance, 91H4489 Leader and 36H00346 Mars.
 “A lot of farmers are dumping their milk,” Mr. Tubolino said. “If we’re going to keep them in business, we’ve got to help them out. They’ve helped me out over the years.”
 Mr. Tubolino plans to donate up to a total of 50,000 “straws,” or units, valued at $20 a unit. A straw contains a specified concentration and volume of semen for a dose. The straws are frozen in steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen.
 The retail value of the total donation is $250,000.
 The amount provided to a farmer, Mr. Tubolino said, depends on the size of the dairy operation. For example, he said a farm with 100 cows will likely require around 300 units for the year. In that case, Mr. Tubolino would provide a “straw” donation for a third of the year.
 Once bulls are known to produce high-quality progeny, they are housed with an artificial insemination company that collects semen.
 “We ship our bulls out to Utah, where they draw the semen and ship it back to us,” Mr. Tubolino said.
 Mr. Tubolino said his straws contain 50 million-to-60 million sperm count per straw. The industry average, he said, is much lower.
 “We more or less make sure these cows are getting pregnant,” he said.
 Mr. Tubolino said a farmer asked him, that among the seven bulls in the donation program, which one he would choose.
 “If I was milking cows, I would pick the whole of them,” he said. “That’s how good they are.”
 Mr. Tubolino, who owns Field of Dreams Genetics with his wife, Janet, is a former dairy farmer who found success in bovine reproduction. He left his family dairy farm nearly 50 years ago to seek to improve quality of dairy cattle.
 Mr. Tubolino said many farmers who have found out about his offer simply can’t believe it.
 “They don’t think it’s true,” he said. “I tell them it’s true, because I’ve got the semen here, why not donate it? Why let it sit there?”
 Dairy farmers must pick up the straws in person at Field of Dreams on Grove Street, and they must bring their own tanks. Usually, company employees go to the farms. But not with the current pandemic.
 “These farmers can’t let anybody in their place because it might affect their workers,” Mr. Tubolino said. “A lot of these farmers have 30 to 40 guys working for them.”
 Jay Matteson, Jefferson County agricultural coordinator, called Mr. Tubolino’s donation program “very generous.”
 “Semen can be expensive and depending on the genetic background of the bull, it can be very expensive,” Mr. Matteson said. “It was a great idea he had and very nice of him to do that. I was very impressed with it.”
 Most dairy farms, Mr. Matteson said, use artificial insemination.
 “It’s the safer way to go,” he said. “They can be a little bit more selective and a lot of farmers are using sexed semen, which gives them a higher percentage of females vs. males. With more farms doing artificial insemination, Gary’s donation allows that farm to ensure that they’re continuing milk production in the future.”
 The only time cows produce milk is after giving birth to a calf.
 “Cows give milk for several months after they give birth to their calf,” Mr. Matteson said. “But then they dry up. The cow is allowed a period of rest. After calving and milking, there’s a period of time where the farm will rest that cow. And then they’ll breed that cow back so that they can start that cycle over again.”
 The calf of the cow, Mr. Matteson said, either becomes a replacement for milk production on the farm, or if it’s a male, it likely will go into beef production.
 Mr. Matteson said that Mr. Tubolino is well known in the breeding industry, and he has seen him at the annual World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wis.
 “Gary knows how to look for the better animals,” Mr. Matteson said. “He’ll work to purchase shares of those bulls that have proven themselves to have the right genetic stock to produce the best dairy cows.”
 But not even the best dairy cow can turn around the dire financial situation now faced by dairy farmers.
 “Right now, the dairy industry is dumping anywhere between 65 and 100 million gallons of milk every week here in the U.S.,” Mr. Matteson said. “I’ve been working in agriculture for 30 years. I would argue that this is the worst situation that the dairy industry has ever been in.”
 Most likely, Mr. Matteson said, there will be efforts to reduce milk production.
 “One of the ways to do that is not having as many dairy cows on the farm,” he said.
 But that doesn’t mean Mr. Tubolino’s donation program is counter to that strategy.
 “Dairy farms will still need to breed their cows back in order to continue their milk production cycle,” Mr. Matteson said. “They just might cull out some of their lower producing cows and keep the better producing cows. Gary’s service is essential to that.”
 When dairy farmers ship milk off the farm, its price is tallied at per 100 pounds of milk.
 “The cost of production ranges between $18 and $10 per 100 pounds of milk shipped,” Mr. Matteson said. “That’s how much it costs to make what they ship. The projections we’re seeing right now is that they’ll get paid somewhere between $11 to $13 per 100 pounds of milk they ship. You can see it’s not a money-making venture right now.”
 The current dairy crisis comes after five years of “horrible”prices for dairy, Mr. Matteson said.
 “This is the perfect storm hitting the dairy industry,” he said.
 But he added that “every little bit helps” and that Mr. Tubolino’s program is a way to assist farmers.
 When Mr. Matteson heard about the Field of Dreams program, he paid a visit to Mr. Tubolino and made a short video that was posted April 4 on the Facebook pages of the company and the Jefferson County Agricultural Economic Development page. As of Thursday, it had nearly 6,000 views and more than 200 shares.
 “That, for me on the agricultural side, is a viral video,” Mr. Matteson said. “I didn’t expect it to take off quite like that. I had people commenting on it who weren’t farmers. They just really love seeing this happen. It gave people that uplift.”

 Mr. Tubolino said any dairy farmer interested in the program may call him at 315-405-1588. Pickup from 41 Grove St. is from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. by appointment.
