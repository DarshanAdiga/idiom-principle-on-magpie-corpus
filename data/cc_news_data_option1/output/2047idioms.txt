and coming rather late in the Corona game, I know! I actually resisted the idea of crowdfunding for a long time, because why should people help your business survive? At the end of the day, it's your problem and not theirs. I guess that's why we've never asked for anything, never tried to get a grant or public money. But when I saw campaigns from venues like ACUD, or support for Berlin's indie Kinos, I realised these were spaces I love and I wanted to help them survive, because they meant something to me, beyond the individuals running them. And maybe helping this magazine go through a tough patch is a little more than keeping a company alive. But then I thought crowdfunding can also be a fun thing, and we started brainstorming and it turned into a team building exercise of sorts.

Sixty miles from Charleston and near the Sheldon Church Ruins, Tomotley Barony, a name believed to have derived from the Cherokee Indians, was formed just as rice was beginning to take root as a major cash crop in the new Carolina colony, less than 30 years after Charles Town was settled.
 During the Civil War, Union troops torched the plantation, though a manager's house, hunting lodge, barns and stables survived and are still on site.

Prende vita così dal 5 giugno SMAspace, una piazza virtuale dedicata al mondo dell’atrofia muscolare spinale, la malattia rara degenerativa – prima causa di morte genetica infantile – che progressivamente indebolisce le capacità motorie e colpisce soprattutto in età pediatrica (in Italia 1 su 6mila). Il progetto prevede tre incontri ed è promosso da Osservatorio malattie rare (Omar) e l’associazione Famiglie Sma. "Risponde all’esigenza di confrontarsi con figure professionali e specialisti che non sempre vengono consultati o spesso limitati a visite periodiche - spiega una nota -. Non è raro che il paziente, accompagnato da familiari, provi inoltre imbarazzo a rivolgere domande considerate 'poco opportune', che invece meritano attenzione e necessitano di risposte puntuali. SMAspace vuole essere dunque quel luogo virtuale dove accorciare le distanze tra paziente e medico, consentendo di fare anche domande in anonimato tramite la piattaforma". Aperto a tutti, ma principalmente rivolto alle persone con Sma e le loro famiglie, prevede la richiesta di partecipazione tramite la mail accrediti@osservatoriomalattierare.it (oggetto: “Richiesta partecipazione SMAspace 5 giugno”).

It's one of the most peaceful places in Wilmington, even when planes fly overhead and the faint hum of traffic manages to break through its borders.
   
 Oakdale Cemetery has been a safe haven for the Port City since it opened its gates as a unique and history-making final resting place in 1855.
   
 The cemetery was born out of a necessity for space. In the decade before the Civil War, Wilmington was booming in its population - pushing 10,000 residents and becoming the largest city in the state. But there became an increasing concern that available burial space was sorely lacking.
   
 It's a problem that persists even today, as the population of Wilmington grows but its available land dwindles and its existing burial grounds reach their max.
   
 With new burial options arising over time - cremation and eco-burials have changed the needs of cemeteries and graveyards - there are more options for that final decision.
      
 But in the mid-19th century, traditional coffin burials were the standard and there needed to be space to accommodate them. So a group of people known as the Proprietors for the Wilmington Cemetery acquired a 65-acre tract of land on the east side of Brunt Mill Creek to start a cemetery in 1852.
   
 Then, 15th Street, off which you now access Oakdale, was not part of downtown. So the establishment of Oakdale on the outskirts of Wilmington made it the state's first rural cemetery. The difference between a cemetery and a graveyard is that a graveyard is attached to a church.
   
 Oakdale was designed not just as a burial ground, but also a park of sorts. Plenty of flowers and immaculate iron gates framed the place of reflection and memory with the beauty of a garden. In its first century, cemeteries weren't the stuff of Halloween spectacle and horror movies, but rather considered parks and places of recreation, where residents could come visit their ancestors among the native vegetation of the region.
   
 In time, there would be plenty of notable Wilmington figures and legendary stories to come visit.
   
 Tragically, the first internment was Annie DeRosset, the 3-year-old daughter of the first president of the cemetery, Armand John DeRosset. She was buried on Feb. 5, 1855, with a small lamb atop her lily white grave marker, etched with the phrase "Our Little Annie."
   
 The next year, Nancy Martin, the daughter of a local lumberer, was buried after legend says she died at sea and was placed in a barrel of whiskey or rum to preserve her body for the journey back to Wilmington. Instead of breaking her free when she got home, the barrel was placed in a special grave and sealed shut, marked by a granite cross that reads "Nance."
   
 As the Civil War got underway, the cemetery would not only start to fill out, but it would also become an essential part of the city's handling of its dead.
   
 The Yellow Fever epidemic of 1862 would rattle the city and send thousands of its residents fleeing their homes for refuge far from the coast. Of those that stayed, at least 1,505 would become infected and 654 would die. Most are buried in Oakdale, around 400 of them in a public burial site atop a hill at the center of the cemetery.
   
 Each day, bodies, sometimes in the double digits, would be wheeled to Oakdale and buried in a spot opened for that day or week.
   
 The period between 1862 and 1867 would also become a blind spot for the cemetery's records, after the superintendent, Charles Quigley, fell victim to the yellow fever himself and war hindered records from being properly kept.
   
 The cemetery would, for a time, hold both the Union and Confederate dead of the area, particularly from the Battle of Fort Fisher. But soon after the war, the Confederate soldiers were removed and buried together under a bronze monument erected by the Ladies Memorial Association in 1872. The Union soldiers, once lying in rows next to Yellow Fever Hill, were also removed and transferred to the Wilmington National Cemetery on Market Street - a move that shows the deep divides that still existed after the war.
   
 Perhaps the most notable burial of the wartime was that of Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a Confederate spy who operated out of Washington, D.C., for the first year of the war and became a vital source of intel for early Southern victories. She was captured, imprisoned, exiled to the South and later sent as an emissary to the Confederacy in Europe. She drowned off Fort Fisher on Sept. 30, 1864 while trying to make her way back into America on board the blockade runner Condor.
   
 Moving past the War Between the States, the cemetery would settle into becoming the designated place for some of Wilmington's biggest names. The Bellamys, the Sprunts, the Kenans and the DeRossets are all buried in hard-to- miss plots.
   
 It would be the final home of figures like Rachel Loman, a renowned nurse on the frontlines of World War I; Katherine Mayo Cowan, the first and only woman to be mayor of Wilmington to this day; Henry Bacon, the architect of the Lincoln Memorial; and William Ellerbrook, a dutiful volunteer firefighter who perished in a 1880 fire along with his loyal dog, Boss. The latter pair are buried together.
   
 David Brinkley, a landmark television journalist; and Edward Dudley, the first North Carolina governor elected by a popular vote, are also among those buried there.
   
 Within its borders is also a Hebrew Cemetery ensconced in iron fencing, as well as a Masonic section.
   
 Oakdale became such a desirable place for residents to lay their loved one to rest that around 80 graves would be removed from other burial sites and re- interred there - some predating the cemetery itself.
   
 By the mid-20th century, the cemetery's plots were almost all spoken for, reigniting a need for more burial space. In 1945, an annex was established, connected to the historic section by a small bridge. Five years later, the opening of the Memorial Garden brought the entire cemetery's reach to 95 acres.
   
 Today, Oakdale has retained much of the intention it was built on - to be a place of respect, reflection and recreation.
   
 It is one of the city's most stunning displays of azaleas each spring and tours that wind through its many sections are held monthly, all benefiting Friends of Oakdale Cemetery, a nonprofit that helps preserve its graves and grounds.
   
 Even in a city that only grows bigger and more bustling with each passing day, Oakdale Cemetery has remained a quiet sanctuary in the heart of Wilmington. A protector of some of its greatest stories and showcase of its natural beauty.
   
 Each stroll through its rows is bound to produce new sights and new discoveries, if only you take the time to look around.

Meet siblings Tomas and Abbey who're making the Internet a happier place with their beautiful actions.This video which is going all kinds of viral shows little Tomas helping sister Abby score a basketball shot. The clip shows Tomas holding the portable basketball net down so his sister Abby, who's on a wheelchair, can score a shot. This adorable gesture has struck a chord with people on the Internet collecting some incredibly heartwarming reactions.
 The video has been shared by Tomas and Abbey's father Greg Mac Curtain on his YouTube channel 'Friends of Abby Mac'.
 Abbey, short for Abigail, is nine-years-old. "Abby suffers from Leigh's Disease which is an infantile form of Mitochondrial Disease," explains a fundraising page. Abbey's dad is running the Boston Marathon in her honour and the proceeds from the fundraiser will go to a team of researchers looking for a cure for the illness.
 The page explains that while Abbey needs a wheelchair to get around and is non-verbal, she has an incredible zest for life as is apparent from this video of her.
   
   
 The clip was also tweeted by former basketball player Rex Chapman with a caption saying, "This brother helping his sister get buckets is definitely the Twitter content I'm here for." His tweet has collected over 6.2 million views, some 4 lakh likes and more than 71,000 retweets.
 The video has collected a ton of heartening reactions from tweeple.
 "This is what we all should be doing always. Thank-you little man for the reminder," reads a comment. "These kids have such beautiful hearts, they have to have wonderful parents," says another. "Everyone should be so lucky to have a brother like that," reads a third.
 "It amazes me the capacity for compassion, empathy & solidarity a 5-year-old can possess while adults can't seem to find a common ground on most subjects; instead we choose to argue, ridicule & insult. We could learn a helluva lot from this 14-second video (myself included)," writes an individual.

Every couple of weeks since school was canceled, Wesley Stewart has a “eureka” moment that sends him rushing out of his bedroom, laptop in hand.
 The second-grader at Round Top Elementary in Blythewood has to show his mom what he just learned. On a recent Friday, for example, he picked up computer coding well enough to recreate the classic Pong video game on his laptop, programming a virtual paddle to smack a ball across the screen.
 Along with 787,000 other students in South Carolina’s K-12 education system, Stewart’s schooling was derailed in March by the coronavirus pandemic. And when schools closed, so did most of their extracurricular activities, clubs and programs.
 But not STEM for Kids, the science-focused after school program Stewart joined last fall. The program was created two years ago by a Richland Two School District parent, Gaurav Sangal, an engineer who was concerned about the lack of hands-on science programming for kids in the Columbia area.
 Sangal built STEM for Kids into a profitable business that has spread to nine Richland Two schools and one private academy. Sangal and his team of instructors — usually students from the University of South Carolina — would take up residence in a school's classroom for two hours every two weeks.
 During in-person labs, students would build Lego robots and test scientific concepts, such as Newton's laws of motion.

Do you ever recall a president who, instead of leading the nation, did nothing but worry about getting re-elected from the moment he was sworn in? I first voted in 1960 – for John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He won, and I thought that this would be a recurring theme for me. Only it took decades for me to vote for another winning candidate for president again.
 But I cannot recall any president, or any other elected official, for that matter, simply campaigning unceasingly from the moment he or she took the vow to protect and defend the Constitution.
 As for Trump’s continuing false assertions and attacks on mailed ballots - but he even admits publicly that he himself voted by mail. But then again, he believes he is above all the laws, all the rules and regulations. He tells us so and shows it to us every day. And not just in his tweets, but every time he can station himself in front of a television camera.
 Any time he can destroy a time-honored tradition, like presiding over the installation of the previous president’s portrait in the White House, he makes sure that he strikes a blow. So we might have to wait until he is defeated in November and Joe Biden can do the honors of unveiling President Obama’s portrait in the White House.
 I keep waiting for at least one or two other Republicans, besides Mitt Romney, to stand up and be counted, to speak out against the vicious, horrible lies which Trump unleashes every day. Now he doesn’t even believe that Fox News slobbers over him enough to be considered among his loyal minions.
 I will continue to follow the advice of Governor Wolf, Governor Cuomo, Dr. Fauci and the handful of honest, reliable officials and commentators who are telling us the truth about COVID-19. And I will continue to stay home and stay safe. And watch religiously MSNBC and CNN - until the body count makes it too depressing to watch. And reading the New York Times, Inquirer, and Main Line Times.

Russia recently sent fighter jets to Libya to support Russian mercenaries fighting for warlord Khalifa Haftar, the US military command for Africa (or Africom) said on Tuesday, in a major escalation in the long-running conflict.
 "For too long, Russia has denied the full extent of its involvement in the ongoing Libyan conflict. Well, there is no denying it now," said US Army General Stephen Townsend in the Africom statement.
 "Russia is clearly trying to tip the scales in its favour in Libya," he added.
 "Just like I saw them doing in Syria, they are expanding their military footprint in Africa using government-supported mercenary groups like Wagner."
 The military fighter aircraft left Russia and first stopped in Syria where they "were repainted to camouflage their Russian origin" before arriving in Libya, said Stuttgart-based Africom.
 The US military did not specify when exactly the jets arrived, only saying that it was "recently".
 Townsend described the Russian warplanes deployed to Libya as "fourth generation jet fighters".

EH Bildu ha recordado que siempre ha considerado que el acercamiento de los presos vascos y "el que se respeten todos sus derechos es una reclamación compartida por la gran mayoría de la sociedad vasca".
 EH Bildu ha subrayado que ha trabajado "de manera discreta" para que ese acercamiento y el respeto a todos sus derechos sea "una realidad" y ha promovido diferentes movilizaciones para "visualizar y canalizar la voluntad de la mayoría vasca para el acercamiento de los presos vascos", así como que, "desde las instituciones vascas se acompañe el proceso emprendido por presos vascos para su vuelta a casa".
 En ese sentido, EH Bildu espera que el que se haya hecho público esta propuesta "no obstaculice el que se convierta en realidad" y "se den pasos decididos en una resolución de la situación que viven presos y familiares".
 EH Bildu ha recordado que la iniciativa presentada este martes se produce tras el manifiesto presentado hace algunas semanas por grupos parlamentarios del Congreso de Madrid, en el que se instaba a "acercar y respetar los derechos de todos los presos, concretamente" o del artículo publicado hace escasos días y firmado por "decenas de representantes internacionales en el que se solicitaba a los estados español y francés medidas concretas para respetar los derechos de presos en tiempos de Covid-19".
 Por último, ha señalado que espera que estas nuevas iniciativas representen los "cimientos de nuevas alianzas en pro de la defensa de los derechos de presos vascos".

The Congress has accused the BJP-led Madhya Pradesh government of putting districts in the green zone to help party leaders campaign for the yet to be announced state assembly bypolls. The principal opposition party, which was in power until two months ago, also complained that the BJP leaders are violating the social distancing norms while out on the campaign trail.
 Stressing its point, the Congress highlighted the situation in three regions.
 In Gwalior, cases have increased from 72 on May 19 to 107 on May 25; in Morena, they have increased from 38 to 83; while in Bhind they have increased from 25 to 49 during the same period.
 Ajay Yadav, Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson, said the entire Chambal- Gwalior belt, which has 16 of the 24 constituencies, has been declared a green zone despite the high number of Covid-19 cases there.
   
   
 "This has been done to allow BJP leaders and their followers to campaign without any hindrance in the region," he said.
 State BJP vice president Vijesh Lunawat said the allegation of the Congress showed that they were giving up already.
 "The norms are the same for all. There is no exception for the BJP leaders," he said.
 The bypolls, necessitated by the resignations of 22 Congress MLAs who rebelled against Kamal Nath, are to be held before September.
 The 22 rebel MLAs later joined the BJP. The resignations were accepted on March 15 and the elections are to be held within six months. Two seats are vacant because of the death of sitting legislators.
 Tulsi Silavat, water resources minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet, who is expected to contest the bypoll from Sanver, the seat he resigned from, visited the constituency last week, accompanied by BJP MP from Indore Shankar Lalwani and MLA Ramesh Mendola.
 MP Congress secretary Rakesh Yadav alleged that there was violation of lockdown restrictions and social distancing norms as a crowd surrounded the minister and other leaders. Silawat, however, said the visit had nothing to do with the bypolls and that he was on an official visit to the constituency.
 "There was no restriction to move around in my constituency," he said.
 On May 24, state BJP leaders claimed that 200 Congressmen from Sanchi in Raisen district joined the BJP at the state BJP headquarters in Bhopal in presence of ex-minister Prabhuram Chaudhary. The latter is likely to re- contest from Sanchi. On this occasion too, the Congress accused the BJP of ignoring social distancing rules.
 The leaders of the BJP and the Congress have held several meetings to prepare for polls in the Gwalior-Chambal region.
 Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who represents Morena in the Lok Sabha, had several meetings with party workers last week in his constituency. Five of the total six assembly seats in Morena district would go to polls.
 Gwalior is another key district with three assembly seats going to polls out of the total six. MP health minister Narottam Mishra and Pradyumn Singh Tomar, who resigned as minister from Kamal Nath government, has held several meetings in the region. Tomar is likely to contest on a BJP ticket from the Gwalior seat.
 "The day CM renamed Chambal expressway as Chambal progress way, the party's campaign in the region started. Leaders are holding small public meetings to inform people about the Congress misrule of 14 months," Lunawat said.
 The Congress has appointed Ashok Singh, former Gwalior mayor as Gwalior district president, and has asked senior party leader Gobind Singh to look after the campaign in the region.
 Another prominent Dalit leader of the Gwalior-Bhind region, Phool Singh Bhariya, was given the Rajya Sabha ticket to strength the party's vote base among Dalits in the region. The Congress has also shifted its war room to Gwalior, indicating that the party was preparing for the polls.
 "Our biggest challenge is selecting the candidates as the established leaders have joined the BJP. That is an opportunity to prop young leadership in the region," said a senior Congress leader, who is tasked with candidate selection.
 Gwalior-based political analyst, Jayant Singh Tomar, said, "The reason why the BJP is ahead of the Congress in the poll campaign is the fact that there is no confusion in the party on candidates' selection. Also, the party has to ensure its victory on at least nine seats to retain power. The Congress is struggling in the candidate selection process."
 The strength of the house has been reduced to 206 from 230 because of the resignation by Congress legislators and death of two BJP lawmakers.
 The BJP, with 107 legislators, is comfortably ahead of the majority mark of 104.
 Yadav said the Congress was confident of the victory despite the ruling party creating hurdles for its leaders to campaign. "The high number of Covid cases have exposed the inability of the Shivraj Singh government to handle any crisis. We worked for welfare of the farmers and downtrodden," he said.
 Lunawat countered by saying that people would vote against the Congress as they were fed up with their misrule of 14 months. He alleged that the Congress rule brought back corruption in transfer and postings.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's closest aide refused to resign on Monday, saying he had done nothing wrong by driving 250 miles from London to access child care when Britons were being told to stay at home to fight COVID-19.
 Dominic Cummings has faced calls to quit from lawmakers, Church of England bishops, police officers and scientists over his trip to County Durham, northern England, which they said had damaged citizens' trust in public health messaging.
 "I did what I thought was the right thing to do," Cummings said during an extraordinary televised grilling in the rose garden at 10 Downing Street, Johnson's official residence.
 "No, I have not offered to resign. No, I have not considered it," Cummings said.
 Johnson's decision to stand by a man on whom he depends as his main strategist has led to his own judgment being questioned, with critics saying the episode signals that the normal rules do not apply to the people in charge.
 "I do regret the confusion and the anger and the pain that people feel. ... That's why I wanted people to understand exactly what had happened," Johnson told a later news conference. "I do not believe that anybody in Number 10 has done anything to undermine our messaging."
 However, that was precisely what scientists and public health experts said both men had done.
 "Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control COVID-19," said Stephen Reicher, a behavioral scientist on an advisory panel, on Twitter.
 With a death toll of around 43,000, Britain is Europe's worst-hit country and the government had already been under pressure over its handling of the pandemic before the Cummings story broke on Friday.
 With a growing number of lawmakers from his own Conservative Party defying him by urging Cummings to quit, Johnson asked his trusted aide, who normally stays behind the scenes, to explain himself in public.
 The choice of the Downing Street garden as the venue underscored Cummings' importance to Johnson, whom he helped to secure Britain's exit from the European Union in a 2016 referendum and later helped to win power.
