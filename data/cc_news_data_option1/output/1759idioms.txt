The only thing I'd add, John, on the long-term targets, obviously, we set those long-term targets in place five plus years ago, and since then, we've made a huge set of investments around some initiatives. If you think about what we've built in logistics as an example, that are going to drive -- that have the potential to drive huge opportunity in unlocking gross margin. And obviously, we set those targets five years ago and put them in place. We didn't know what the investments were going to look like or what the world was going to look like today. So I do think there's upside throughout the P&L as we sort of start to see all the investments we've made over the last few years bear fruit over the coming years.

It’s been said that Gustave is a version of Anderson. And it’s true that in the introduction to M. Gustave, in which he zips through the hotel lobby barking orders left and right, he is very reminiscent, in Anderson’s work, of the American Express commercial in which Anderson plays a “director.” There he plays an idealized version of himself based on his heroes, most obviously Truffaut, since the commercial is an homage to _Day for Night_. But Anderson also seems to be modeling his persona here on old 16mm interviews with John Ford, Howard Hawks and the self-mythologized John Huston. “Making movies. How do you do it?

Carnival Cruise Line said Monday it will delay most of its North American cruises, including the Sunshine's departures from Union Pier in downtown Charleston, until at least Sept. 1 as COVID-19 fears continue to hammer the travel industry.
 Only a handful of cruises will operate from ports in Florida and Texas starting Aug. 1, with all other cruises canceled through the end of that month. It's not clear exactly when the Sunshine will return to Charleston. The State Ports Authority has removed its calendar of cruise operations from it website, and Carnival's booking website does not show any available cruises from the Holy City through this year.
 "We are taking a measured approach, focusing our return to service on a select number of home ports where we have more significant operations that are easily accessible by car for the majority of our guests," Carnival said in a statement.
 "We will use this additional time to continue to engage experts, government officials and stakeholders on additional protocols and procedures to protect the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve," the cruise line stated. "We appreciate the understanding and support of our guests and travel agent partners and look forward to welcoming them on board as the environment for travel and tourism improves."

Our first quarter results meaningfully outperformed our original guidance expectations despite the extreme market volatility that began in early March. By and large our producer customers maintained their completion programs through the end of March. As a result of our strong financial results for the quarter combined with our solid leverage ratio of four times and coverage ratio of approximately 2.1 times we announced a flat distribution quarter-over-quarter of $0.625 per unit or $2.50 per unit on an annualized basis which is payable on May the 15 to all unit holders of record as at Friday, May 8.

The Grand Budapest Hotel is not in Budapest. It’s in the former republic of Zubrowka, a mountainous European nation that seems to be a sister state of Lubitsch’s Flausenthurm (from _The Smiling Lieutenant_ ) or Marshovia ( _The Merry Widow_ ). These fake nations are also likely in league with _Cracked Nuts_ ’ El Dorania and, most famously, _Duck Soup_ ’s Freedonia. All of these films were released between 1931 and 1934, and the main action in Wes Anderson’s homage takes place in 1932. Why this time period? After the mass deaths of the first world war, Twentieth Century trauma and loss affected everything familiar, so imaginations sought escape in untainted, made-up places. (Not quite utopias, these countries usually featured an uneasy mix of fallen royalty, impossible bureaucracy and wandering livestock.)

Well, I mean listen, labor was tight before we got into this pandemic. Labor has become increasingly tight, and the costs have gone up pretty much across the board in both SNFs and house. PPE, obviously, something that's gone up considerably. A lot of PPE wasn't used in-house before this pandemic and was only used sparingly in SNFs. On the backside of this pandemic, I'm pretty sure that you're going to still have a fair amount of PPE being utilized for some time in the future. So I think part of that cost will remain in place.

 TOPEKA -- Kansas residents eager to flee the confines of their homes after six weeks of state-imposed restrictions got their first glimpse Monday of what life will be like in a post-pandemic world.
   
 Gov. Laura Kelly's stay-at-home order expired Sunday night as she moved the state into the first part of a three-phase plan to reopen Kansas and breathe life into an economy on life support. Some businesses, including restaurants, opened their doors for the first time in weeks, with the addition of social distancing protocols.
   
 The transition included a passing of the baton to county health officials, who have the option of imposing tighter restrictions based on local infections, hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus.
   
 Statewide, health officials have attributed 136 deaths to COVID-19 and recorded more than 5,200 infections. If daily numbers continue their downward trend, the governor will advance the state to phase two in mid-May. At that point, public gatherings may increase from 10 to 30 individuals, and places like gyms and hair salons could reopen.
   
 For now, said Amanda Miller, employee at Apron Strings Kitchen Store in Hutchinson, it doesn't feel like much has changed.
   
 "We're still taking orders over the phone, and we can deliver orders," Miller said.
   
 The store didn't need to be reconfigured to allow for social distancing guidelines.
   
 "We have a big floor plan so we have plenty of space for people to keep their distance," Miller said.
   
 The biggest change is that employees are wearing cloth face masks, she said, and there is hand sanitizer at the counter. Also, the kitchen store isn't offering food samples like it normally would.
   
 Restaurants were preparing to open with reduced hours, less staff, altered menus, new seating arrangements and the addition of Plexiglas barriers.
   
 The Wheel Barrel, which slings grilled cheese sandwiches in North Topeka, was preparing to reopen Tuesday with crowd control measures and a sanitation station in place.
   
 Jennifer Bohlander, who owns the restaurant with her husband, said business owners are under pressure to pay bills while keeping employees and patrons from getting sick.
   
 "These are really hard decisions to make," Bohlander said. "Every business owner is caught between a rock and a hard place."
   
 Hair peace
   
 Angry barbers and stylists across the state wanted to know who cut the governor's hair.
   
 Rep. Cheryl Helmer, R-Mulvane, demanded an inquiry.
   
 Last week, The Topeka Capital-Journal revealed there had been no clandestine mission by Kelly to circumvent her own rules. In a conversation with The Capital-Journal's editorial advisory board, she said her husband and his steady hand were responsible for the trim.
   
 That report led some on social media to wonder whether such questions would ever be asked of a male political leader.
   
 Enter Lee Norman, the secretary for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and officer in the Kansas Army National Guard, who injected levity into the conversation through his Twitter account.
   
 "I'm devastated," Norman wrote. "I will be on Army duty this weekend with a fresh high and tight haircut, which I had today and nobody noticed. Sigh. Always a bridesmaid and never a bride, I guess!"
   
 So, who cut Norman's hair?
   
 "Me," Norman said. "Dog grooming clippers. Woof!"
   
 Prison infections
   
 The Kansas Department of Corrections announced Monday a third inmate has died from COVID-19 at the state-run prison in Lansing, and the Hutchinson and Ellsworth prisons confirmed their first cases.
   
 Nearly 400 inmates and more than 80 staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus at Lansing Correctional Facility, where an outbreak has forced the prison into a two-week lockdown.
   
 Health officials were working through the weekend to test every Lansing inmate. Earlier, preliminary test results indicated 75% of inmates had the virus but weren't showing symptoms.
   
 Defense attorneys and other inmate advocates have called for the early release of prisoners who committed less serious crimes or who have just months left on their sentence.
   
 Jennifer Roth, a Topeka attorney with the Kansas Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, Heather Cessna, executive director of Kansas Board of Indigents' Defense Services, and Melody Brannon, federal public defender for Kansas, pleaded in March for officials to protect inmates at state prisons.
   
 "What we feared would happen, did happen," Roth said.
   
 Kelly has indicated her administration is reviewing candidates for early release who have viable plans for re-entering their communities.
   
 "They waited a month," Roth said, "so their failure to act promptly to release people led to them saying they couldn't release people. It's maddening. That said, there is still time for the governor and KDOC to take action to prevent other facilities from becoming the next Lansing. The powers-that-be have a chance to do better. They must do better."
   
 Three inmates have tested positive at the Wichita Work Release Facility, as well as a staff member at the Kansas Juvenile Correctional Complex and a staff member at the El Dorado Correctional Facility. At the state-run women's prison in Topeka, three staff members and two inmates have tested positive.
   
 An inmate who tested positive at Hutchinson Correctional Facility had recently arrived from Lansing. The man was placed in isolation upon arrival and returned to Lansing after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.
   
 The positive test of a staff member at Ellsworth Correctional Facility was the first confirmed case in Ellsworth County. The agency said health officials would conduct contact tracing to identify any staff or inmates who were in close contact with the infected individual. Corrections staff also will monitor staff and inmates for symptoms.
   
 "I want to reassure the community that we will be diligent in our efforts to mitigate the effects this virus has on our staff and population," said corrections secretary Jeff Zmuda. "We are working very closely with KDHE and will continue to follow their guidance on the best ways to manage a virus like COVID-19 within the prison setting."

 Wolverhampton Wanderers, meanwhile, are keen to resume the season when it is safe to do so and their players are expected back at Compton Park in the next week.
 However, this latest revelation - as reported by The Athletic \- adds fresh doubt to whether the season can actually be finished safely.

Yes, I understand. It's a little tough to gauge. I guess just last question, Taylor, how are you thinking about rent deferral request if they come in? I get that there hasn't been many yet, but as you're saying, it feels like the industry in the short run is facing more pressure. You get through this period and then you get back to normal, and there are a lot of benefits that are in place via PDPM, the removal of sequestration cuts. So if you're getting a rent deferral request this month, next month, what is your approach going to be? Are you going to make sure that the operator is fully exhausted every sort of federal program out there? Are you going to -- are you more likely to give a deferral versus some sort of permanent level of a rent cut? How should we think about what could still play out here for your portfolio?

--DocBreak--
Yes. So I mean none of my operators were out going out on a limb trying to predict what this virus is going to do in the future. So they have no idea what's going to -- how that's going to affect occupancy, obviously. But if it continues to ravage their facilities and becomes more widespread, occupancies got to continue to suffer. If it starts to lighten up, occupancy should theoretically improve. We've heard rumors that certain states might start to open up. I haven't heard of any specific state that has actually said that they're going to start to allow elective surgeries. But I might have missed it. At this point, I know none that have specifically stated a date for when they would start to open up the doors for elective surgeries.

LOS ANGELES (WITN) - Three Camp Lejeune Marines are being credited for subduing a hostile passenger on a flight from Japan to Texas on Monday.Capt. Daniel Kult, Sgt. John Dietrick and Pfc. Alexander Meinhardt of 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, were traveling back to the U.S. from a deployment program in Okinawa.The Marine Corps says a man on the flight barricaded himself in the restroom and made threatening comments."While watching a movie during my flight from Japan to Texas, I started to hear screaming coming from the restroom on board," said Dietrick. "When I took off my headphones, I heard a man sounding very distraught and screaming from the bathroom."The three Marines waited outside the restroom while a crew member unlocked the door. They grabbed the man and restrained him with flex ties."I knew I had to step in when he became a danger to others and himself," said Meinhardt. "I didn't think twice about helping restrain him through the rest of the flight."The flight was diverted to Los Angeles International Airport and the passenger was taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation."We are well trained and it paid off today," said Kult. "We just assessed the situation and acted. Working with the flight crew, we got the door open and from there worked together to subdue him. We didn't take time to talk it over. We just got ready and did what we needed to help."The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in L.A. are investigating the hostile man and what he did on the plane.Copyright 2020 WITN via Gray Media Group, Inc.

I could not believe my credit card bill when I clicked it open a few days ago. The card that pays for petrol was zero. Zero. The other one was down to 20% of earlier spends. And I consider myself frugal—spending on what I need and not what I greed—and yet the difference a lockdown made to my own spends left me quite amazed. My age cohort and I grew up in an India of very limited means, choices and options. Basics like milk, water and electricity were in short supply. Less than five homes in 100 had a phone in most middle-class metro colonies and if you owned a car, you had either inherited it or were up to no good in that business of yours. But our generation was also on the ground floor when India opened up and was able to ride the wave of growth that lifted a lot of boats. Things began to change, but slowly. By the time the 1990s kids were born, small luxuries were becoming commonplace—eating out was not that budget breaking exercise that it used to be. The ’90s kids still remember a money-careful approach and some built money habits that usually last a lifetime. It is the parent and kids cohort of the 2000s and above that probably is really struggling with the new tight-money reality of the pandemic.

As display panels in smartphones play a significant role in brand and product differentiation, the TDDI solutions are witnessing considerable traction from the smartphone industry. The demand for TDDI as well as COF-based display drivers is likely to increase on the back of rapidly expanding display technology, growing adoption of flexible display panels, and emergence of full-view displays in smartphones. TDDI solutions are witnessing traction, owing to the rapid growth of the market for full-screen smartphone displays, for which the inclusion of TDDI solutions was among the numerous key requirements. Furthermore, with demand for the larger screen-to-body ratio typical of full-screen smartphone displays likely to become more pervasive, TDDI combined with COF solutions are likely to witness increased traction.

This historic proclamation, dated November 7, 1775 and issued from on board a _British_ warship lying off Norfolk, _Virginia_ , by royal governor and _Scottish_ aristocrat John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, offered the first large- scale emancipation of _slave_ and servant labor in the history of colonial British America. It grew out of Dunmore’s efforts to counter an impending attack on his capital of Williamsburg by patriot militia in the spring of 1775, when he several times threatened to free and arm slaves to defend the cause of royal government. By the time he retreated offshore he was already gathering slaves seeking refuge; his November proclamation commanding Virginians to support the crown or be judged traitors now formally offered freedom to all slaves and indentured servants belonging to rebels and able to bear arms for the crown. Within weeks, several hundred slaves, many with their families, had joined him. They enlisted in what Dunmore christened his “ _Ethiopian_ Regiment” and formed the bulk of the royal troops that first defeated patriot forces but then fell victim to disease and attack, evacuating the Chesapeake Region for _New York_ by August 1776.

Are Sundays and Wednesdays a sign of things to come?
   
 Probably, but this wasn't the way NASCAR wanted to roll out its new scheduling philosophy. The schedule for the 2021 season, which would be run in the new Next Gen stock car, was pegged for an April release. But as you noticed, things got in the way as April came and went in a muffled manner. Finalization of the 2021 schedule gave way to a hectic rework of 2020, and the Next Gen cars went back in the closet, awaiting a 2022 unveiling.
   
 So what about 2021?
   
 All along, much of the educated speculation focused on the probability of some midweek races dotting the revamped NASCAR schedule, as the sport's leaders looked for ways to shorten the calendar and streamline travel costs. So this, though unwanted, gives NASCAR a chance to test-drive the future and most likely give the networks some big midweek numbers along the way.

Serving the public
 After two months of closures and restrictions, Israel appears to finally be heading back to a semblance of normalcy. Infection numbers are dramatically down, and we are finally able to reopen the economy, step by step.
 However, it would be fair to say that during these last two months, we've seen how it looks when a military is not prepared for the big war.
 In elementary schools in Israel, for instance, children are prepared for all kinds of different scenarios that might hit the country by surprise, such as airstrikes or earthquakes.
 IDF Home Front Command ads teach people how to find the nearest shelter in case of a rocket attack. Buildings undergoing the national construction plan called "Tama 38" in order to strengthen structures ahead of earthquakes are also regular sights in Israel. But not pandemics.
 Yes, it looks like we won the first battle, but let's not forget the complaints about a lack of medical supplies, doctors, nurses and protective gear. Let's not forget how the Mossad and Sayeret Matkal - the elite IDF commando unit - were needed to step in and import masks and ventilators.
 The war isn't over yet. The numbers are still increasing and experts are predicting a harsher second wave at some point later this year.
 How will we enter this second wave? Who will lead that coming health war?
 In order to combat the pandemic, the two big parties - Likud and Blue and White - decided to join forces and form a unity government.
 When they announced the intention to form a unity government, both sides referred to the current situation as a "state of emergency." We supported the establishment of the government even though it meant enabling Benjamin Netanyahu to remain prime minister while standing trial for severe corruption charges.
 But how come none of the top members of these parties wants to head the Health Ministry? How come none of them want to take command and lead us in this war?
 In the current negotiations, we've seen Blue and White demand the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Justice Ministry and others. What happened to "Israel before anything else"?
 Benny Gantz himself said in a statement after he decided to join Netanyahu, that this "state of emergency that was imposed on the State of Israel does not allow any leader to close their eyes and shut their ears, and deal only with their personal matters." So why isn't the party led by two generals - Gantz and former chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi - fighting to lead the Health Ministry?
 More specifically, as Amotz Asa-El wrote in Friday's Jerusalem Post, Ashkenazi has the background and expertise needed to lead the Health Ministry right now. He has commanded the IDF, both in times of peace and war. He should know how to easily take control of what has now become one of the most important offices in Israel.
 And the Likud Party, whose members were reportedly ordered to remain silent during the past month, became vocal only when the High Court started to discuss Netanyahu's ability to form a coalition.
 Does no one in the ruling party in the past eleven years think that leading the battle against the worst pandemic in recent history is more important than Netanyahu's battle to stay in power?
 The Likud chose to send Agriculture Minister Tzachi Hanegbi to Channel 12's Meet the Press on Saturday night to present Netanyahu's legal arguments ahead of the High Court hearing. In the interview, Hanegbi referred to the situation as an "extreme state of emergency," to explain why a unity government is needed.
 When asked about the concessions his party made to reach a unity government, Hanegbi said, "we've made enormous concessions on things we [already] have in our hands. We have seventeen ministers from which seven are going home."
 Are these the big concessions? This is what the Likud members are dealing with now, during the "extreme state of emergency?" When the government calls on all citizens to lean in, lend a hand and help our country overcome this crisis, why are the Likud ministers seemingly more interested in the question of which of them will get a driver and a larger ministerial staff?
 We expect more from our leaders. Instead of fighting over who will take control over the battle in this unprecedented pandemic, all the politicians talk about is whether Netanyahu can form a government and how that government will look.
 The Health Ministry needs to be looked at as more than just a sinking ship. Israel comes first - and the Health Ministry is now at the top.

Star Wars enthusiasts have adopted May 4 as their holiday, playing off the movies' oft-repeated line "May the Force be with you," but replacing "Force" with "Fourth."
   
 Hoping to engage students during this coronavirus-forced season of virtual learning, some local teachers brought in a special guest who knows a thing or two about the movie franchise.
   
 West Indianola Elementary School featured actor Spencer Wilding in a Star Wars-themed virtual assembly on Monday. The Welsh actor's gentle and patient presentation belied his alter ego, the dreaded Darth Vader.
   
 Wilding is one of several men who have donned the iconic black mask and costume to portray perhaps the most iconic villain in movie history. Chosen for his huge and athletic stature, Wilding played Vader in the 2016 installment "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story." By seeing only his face on the Zoom video, students weren't able to appreciate that Wilding stands 6 feet 6 inches tall and has the physique of a former professional boxer and kickboxer.
   
 Teachers Melissa Modig and Cristin Casteel kicked off the morning announcements on Monday wearing masks of Star Wars characters, with images from the movies behind them and the unmistakable theme song playing in the background. After the necessary school announcements and a round of Star Wars- themed jokes, the teachers were joined on the screen by Wilding. He answered 12 questions submitted by students, talking about his career and particularly about playing Vader.
   
 "Spencer made a point to call each student by name who submitted a question, which was really neat, I thought," said Casteel, a third-grade teacher. "He made it so personal to each student."
   
 Aside from "Rogue One," Wilding has appeared in numerous movies that children recognize, including the Harry Potter and Dr. Who series, "Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Batman Begins." He typically plays strong and imposing characters, often using prosthetics and makeup, but somehow appeals to children.
   
 "It's awesome to play roles children recognize," Wilding said. "Kids trust me, so I get to talk to them in a way others sometimes can't. So I've got to be careful what I say. I've got to give them the good stuff."
   
 Wilding said aside from appearing at conventions and speaking to school groups, he has a lot of experience talking to children.
   
 "I've been teaching kids in kickboxing for years," he said. "I love kids. I can jump down on their level pretty easily. I teach them self defense but also life lessons and enhance their confidence."
   
 Encouraging confidence and advocating reading are two objectives for Wilding in his public appearances, because of disabilities he had to overcome himself.
   
 "I'm dyslexic, so I couldn't read or write properly until about age 32, when I just started acting," Wilding said. "I started in the creature world first, so it wasn't (a problem) with dialogue. But a couple of years down the line I got better with reading and now I'm holding my own with the big boys.
   
 "A lot of kids in school have a disability like me, so I do like to (appeal) to those kids to be an example, so that they can say, 'Well, Spencer is dyslexic and he's Darth Vader, so I'm all right.' We're all special in different ways."
   
 "One of the best things about being a teacher is seeing what happens with students down the road," Casteel said. "So seeing a success story like Spencer's is awesome. It's why we teach."
   
 Modig said a focus on Star Wars has become a May 4 tradition. She said the unusual circumstances this year called for something special.
   
 "Cristin and I have always done a big Star Wars thing at school, so we decided to add this because it was on a Monday and could fit with the announcements," said Modig, who teaches sixth grade. "I think it's great for the kids, and I hope it lifts their spirits this year since this has been such a different experience for them.
   
 "We have to find new, fun ways to keep kids wanting to continue to connect with their teachers and school during this time when there are other options in their homes."
   
 Casteel said the weeks of virtual learning have worn on the students, as well as their parents.
   
 "That's when you really need to get creative and think, 'What would get me excited to learn again?' It wasn't even a hesitation thinking about asking Spencer for his help. He's all about the kids. That's the kind of genuine stand-up guy he is."
   
 Six time zones away, Wilding is practicing social distancing at his home in Wales. He appreciates the efforts of teachers all over the world who are trying to overcome the obstacles the coronavirus is placing in the way of education.
   
 "We've all got to bring the positive out of this. It's beautiful the way everyone is coming together," Wilding said. "The students are learning new things. The teachers are learning new things. This wasn't in their training. This is a new page of a new book. Thank goodness for the technology that's letting us do these things."

Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. As you will hear more about today, this is a high-touch industry and therefore, controlling the spread of the virus once it gets in a building is difficult to say the least. Our operators are faced with numerous challenges, not the least of which is adapting to the COVID-19-specific infectious disease control guidelines set forth by CMS and the CDC. All new admissions are treated as presumptive positive and quarantined for 14 days. Vendors in most areas are not permitted entry into buildings and lastly, food and other deliveries outside for employees to bring in. Our operators are having to find ways to reconfigure their buildings so that they have dedicated wings for positive or suspected positive residents. They are also looking at their portfolios to determine whether there are buildings that can be fully dedicated to COVID-19 patients. We have several instances of that in our portfolio. And while the number of these dedicated buildings is likely to grow, we do not believe that it will grow substantially.

Okay. And then last one for me on the guidance withdrawal, bit of a higher- level question. Why did you decide to pull this versus adjusted? I mean at the end of the day, you are a triple-net lease REIT with no external growth guidance. You collected most of -- I mean, 98% of your rent last month. And it seems like you could at least maybe maintain a run rate figure, and I understand guidance has been withdrawn everywhere across the REIT space in Corporate America, and there's no shortage of uncertainty. But there was another triple-net lease health care REIT that maintained their run rate guidance last week. So I'm just trying to better understand what you see that caused you to pull it. If you can share your thought process there about the outlook.

Yes. Thanks Bob. We signed the transaction in February and closed it April 1 as we've already talked about but these are assets that we've coveted for a number of years because of their strategic position in our portfolio and it was a great opportunity where Plains was de-emphasizing the business, the very high touch business but fortunately for us we were able to incorporate this high touch business into our existing portfolio without adding any head count on the back office or front office side. So very good with our existing asset base set to outperform our original underwriting expectations not only in the nine months that we're going to own it in 2020 but well beyond.

There is growing support from the Junction City community, on social media, seeking to recognize the Class of 2020 with some form of ceremony or celebration of their accomplishments to close out the year formally.
 Carrie Yale, mother of Dain Yale Jr., and Crystal Rey, mother of Celeste Rey, are working to put together a celebration in June to honor the nearly 300 graduates of Junction City High School.
 “We both just feel that we want to honor our students and give them the celebration that they have worked so hard for,” Yale said. “We are not trying to change anybody’s mind. We’re not trying to project any kind of negativity towards the high school — our sole intention is just to cater to those who want to participate. We want to be able to host, some kind of celebration for our graduates — they’ve worked so hard. We just we want to showcase them and show them that there’s just so much support in our town.”
 The two moms use time, after work, to call, email and reach out to the community for support — venue, donations and more.
 “We just want to get the word out there that we are working on this and that there’s anybody in the community that wishes to support us, we would love to have the support of the community,” she said. “Any businesses that would like to donate any kind of items, any monetary, any kind of gifts for the graduates.
 The two are in the early stages of the planning process, Yale said, but hope to get some of the details firmed in the next few weeks.”
 Yale and Rey do have a solid date in mind.
 “The date that we have discussed is June 20, and with the amount of people that we imagine participating, it’s still going to be within the guidelines that are set by the governor,” Yale said. “We don’t wish to do anything that is immoral or put anybody’s health at risk. We plan, if anything changes as far as the guidelines, we plan to still implement those. If there’s still 6-feet of distancing, we have reached out to venues and areas that will accommodate for that exceeded distancing. So, no matter what the rules are we will be prepared for that.”
 Yale said graduation is about celebrating the accomplishments of the students, some who are graduating as juniors. She also admitted there has been some negative feedback toward the idea.
 “We’ve had a lot of conflicting feedback from people who think it’s just the parents who have this selfish need and desire to watch their children walk across the stage,” she said. “And, it really is much more than that. There’s lots of seniors and juniors, who want to do that themselves. They’ve worked so hard for that — that is a milestone in their life. Some may go on to college and be able to walk again, some may not. So, this may be their only chance to walk cross that stage and hold their head high and say, ‘Look, I did this. I accomplished this, this is mine. And there’s all these people here to support me.’”
 Yale understands the school district’s decision to hold a virtual graduation with photos of the graduates being displayed as their name is read. She also understands part of the district’s reasoning for the ceremony due to the number of students affiliated with the military and the chances of those students and respective parents not being present for the occasion.
 “I certainly understand that there are a lot of factors that they had to put in place,” she said. “We do wish to honor, any of the students, whether they’re there physically or not. If there’s a parent whose student has left and the mother or father would like to walk across the stage for them, we would love to do that for them. We don’t want to exclude anybody in the celebration that we are planning. Any way that makes sense to any parent or graduate, we wish to include.
 “I feel, and I speak for myself, I feel that if they were to change it and still honor the graduation, even if it was at a later date, we would love that,” she added. “That is the main goal is to have the high school and the district honor their students at that time.”
 Yale has been in contact with school board members and principals within the district, she said. Her hopes are to include them and others in the celebration.
 “We look forward to any kind of support from the community,” she said. “We again aren’t trying to change any minds, we just want to bring in and bring on board the ones that wish to participate.”

 The results demonstrate the short-term reversal effect is still present in stocks, as the worst-performing stocks tend to outperform the stock market. Even after deducting commission fees for each trades, the results are significant. The trading strategy does come with material downside risk, as some of the worst-performing stocks tend to decline even further. In the long run, this effect is compensated again by the stock performance of our winners, but in the mid-term, we can expect large equity drawdowns.

This historic proclamation, dated November 7, 1775 and issued from on board a _British_ warship lying off Norfolk, _Virginia_ , by royal governor and _Scottish_ aristocrat John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, offered the first large- scale emancipation of _slave_ and servant labor in the history of colonial British America. It grew out of Dunmore’s efforts to counter an impending attack on his capital of Williamsburg by patriot militia in the spring of 1775, when he several times threatened to free and arm slaves to defend the cause of royal government. By the time he retreated offshore he was already gathering slaves seeking refuge; his November proclamation commanding Virginians to support the crown or be judged traitors now formally offered freedom to all slaves and indentured servants belonging to rebels and able to bear arms for the crown. Within weeks, several hundred slaves, many with their families, had joined him. They enlisted in what Dunmore christened his “ _Ethiopian_ Regiment” and formed the bulk of the royal troops that first defeated patriot forces but then fell victim to disease and attack, evacuating the Chesapeake Region for _New York_ by August 1776.

As I noted in my last letter to you, the process for resuming public worship in our churches will happen gradually in phases over time as restrictions on public gatherings are eased.

Therefore, I am allowing you to open your churches starting on Monday, May 4, for a limited number of hours each day for essential pastoral care and so people may participate in individual prayer and adoration.

Re: “Gloves should not be worn in public, health officials say” (The Sentinel, April 24),
 My hands are very dry all the time. I respectfully will continue to wear gloves when I go to any store, as it is not possible to wash hands immediately. Do you really think that most people are going to pull out hand sanitizer and use it each time they sneeze, cough or touch their face? That is, if you are lucky enough to find hand sanitizer. Have you not heard about or seen the shortage in stores and online?
 I have a routine that I think protects me as best and it involves wearing gloves. Once I put the items I buy into the back of my car, I know how to take them off carefully without contaminating my hands; before I get into my car, so I am not contaminating keys, the door handle etc. I throw the gloves into a trash bag I keep in the back. Then I will use hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol, though I am more skeptical of the alcohol concentration in hand sanitizer than of rubbing alcohol. If I go to another store, I put on new gloves.
