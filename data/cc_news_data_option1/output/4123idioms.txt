The indoor galleries at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum in Lincoln have finally reopened with two new exhibits, "Visionary New England" and "Transcendental Modernism." But it's the deCordova's Sculpture Park that's been an artistic refuge for families during the pandemic looking to retreat from the confines of their living rooms and take a break from computer classes.
 The deCordova Sculpture Park is 30 acres of field and forests, lawns and rolling landscape dotted with a wonderland of sculptures by 20th and 21st century artists, including Dorothy Dehner, Andy Goldsworthy, Antony Gormley, Dan Graham, Alexander Liberman, Nam June Paik, Beverly Pepper, Jaume Plensa, George Rickey and Ursula von Rydingsvard. Also on loan to the museum are pieces by Jim Dine, DeWitt Godfrey, Paul Matisse and Isaac Witkin.
 The restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic have led families to explore new places. Families say they feel safe exploring the deCordova's Sculpture Park, where masks and social distancing are required.

    Angling for the truth at the deCordova in Lincoln  
 "Visiting the deCordova Sculpture Park was something I had been wanting to do for years!" said Mansfield resident Theresa Edo, who visited the deCordova recently with son Luke, 10, and daughter Emily, 13.
 "The grounds were a beautiful walk, and we liked that small placards on the ground would tell us a bit about each piece or a phone number to call for more info," said Edo, who is the director of communications for the American Cancer Society's Northeast Region, in an email. "It sparked conversations about what we saw or felt when we looked at the art, yet it didn't feel as 'serious' or out-of-touch as an indoor art gallery might have."

 Freeman said she loved hearing her kids "form their own opinions about what they liked or didn't, or just seeing their appreciation grow. And, it was great that it was a close, in-state drive. We hit Dairy Joy in Weston afterwards for a yummy outdoor lunch!"
 A visit to the deCordova's Sculpture Park was just one of many day trips for Needham residents Andrew and Kristen Collins, who visited recently with their 15-year-old daughter Rory and 12-year-old son Kiernan.
 "...like everybody else, my wife and I have tried to help our children adjust to the 'new normal' and the pandemic," Andrew Collins wrote in an email. While the family has been able to escape for trips to the Cape and the Adirondacks for a change of scenery, Andrew Collins said he and his active son really enjoy getting outside and away from the computer for a paddle on the Charles, a hike in Needham Town Forest or a visit to the deCordova where Andrew's company, Sentient Jet, has worked in the past for museum's benefit auction. Kristen Collins is the creator of "The Front Steps Project" with photographer Cara Soulia, featuring portraits of Needham families made during the pandemic. Their book about the project is due next month.
 "When we were thinking of an interesting afternoon, this just happened to strike the right chord," Andrew Collins said. "It was outdoors, it is clearly one of Boston's unique cultural spots, and it just felt like Kiernan might enjoy it. The pre-purchase of a reservation was nice and it was simple.

 "The grounds are well cared for and so spread out that we never felt we were in any social-distancing violations and found visitors to be very respectful," Collins continued. "My son was really taken by both the unique nature of the statues and exhibits as well as the placards with information on the artist. Unexpected things really captured his attention - giant heads, giant hearts, or oversized leaf. as well as the large cylinder-like pipes that he could stand in. As we headed back to our car at the end of the day he also found an old automobile with a unique silver coloring."
 The deCordova has been on Heather Harris' bucket list since she moved to Massachusetts 15 years ago, she said.
 "Because of COVID-19 our schedules have slowed down and there are fewer sporting events to go to," said Harris, a Mansfield resident who is a staff writer with the marketing and communications department at Bridgewater State University. She also writes a regular column called "A League of Her Own" for the Country Gazette. A visit to the deCordova was "a perfect opportunity to safely practice social distancing while exposing the kids to art. My mom was an artist and art teacher, so it was kind of a nice way to extend her passion to my children."
 Harris said her children, Dexter, 15, and Vivien, 12, who have been learning remotely but will be switching to some in-person classes, really enjoyed the outdoor museum.
 "The giant heart sculptures were a family favorite," Harris said. "I am known as the 'heart lady' and am always keeping an eye out for hearts in nature and random places. From a distance they are fun to look at, but when you get closer, they are even more interesting when you examine all of the different objects embedded in the two sculptures."
 This was Harris' first visit to the deCordova. Passes sell out quickly, she said, so be sure to plan your visit ahead.
 Harris' children explored giant teepees and a plexiglass sculpture they could also enter that many younger kids also enjoyed exploring. "There was a sculpture that if you ran sticks along it, it created music/noise," said added. "There are even canopying trees that you can enter and see what it looks like from inside of a tree.
 "As my kids are older, we talked about their take on things. What they thought the artist was trying to convey, why they chose a specific medium," Harris said. "Dexter is taking a public art class this year at Mansfield High School and it was awesome to be able to bring him and have him relate what he was seeing to his class content."

MEXICO CITY (AP) — At least 14 suspected gunmen are dead and three police officers are recovering from wounds suffered in a massive shootout in the northern state of Zacatecas. The state police say their officers were on patrol Monday when they came under fire by armed attackers. One officer was shot and two suffered bullet fragment injuries. But police say that after the shooting near the town of Calera was over, they found 14 bodies and one wounded suspect. Police also collected eight assault rifles at the scene, along with three vehicles. The state is being fought over by the Sinaloa, Jalisco and other cartels.

Amid increase in the number of local youth joining militancy in the Kashmir valley and focus on dissuading them, the Army’s 15 Corps Battle School (CBS) here has introduced a psychology module in its sensitisation programme for personnel coming to serve in the valley and along the Line of Control (LoC).
 “The psychological capsule has been developed in conjunction with the Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR) and is imparted selectively among those undergoing the 28-day orientation programme before induction in the Kashmir valley,” a senior officer at the CBS said. In the general sensitisation capsules too, there is an increasing focus on convincing local youth caught in encounters to surrender.
 All soldiers deployed to the valley and the LoC under the 15 Corps area have to undergo a sensitisation programme. All personnel posted to the LoC undergo a 14-day capsule and those deployed in the valley a 28-day capsule.
 There are four tenets on which the orientation is based upon — good faith and just conduct, minimum force, avoidance of collateral damage and impartiality and necessity of operations, the officer said. We try to create a cognitive memory here to prepare on various scenarios they might face, another officer at the CBS said. The CBS follows a case study based approach to orient personnel, he said.
 A team from the DIPR visited the CBS in 2019 and interacted with the faculty and trainees following which they built the module. The CBS trains 3,000 to 3,200 troops every year in several courses. “Selected lot of 200 to 250 soldiers and officers from the trainees go through the capsule,” the first officer said.
 He said the use of drones and youth recruitment among others are the new threats being faced in the valley. To counter youth recruitment, the Army is bringing in families to dissuade them and give up weapons. As per data from the Army, 219 locals joined militancy in 2018, 119 in 2019 and 135 till October 6.
