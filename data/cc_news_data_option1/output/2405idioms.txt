According to Sears' arrest citation, Pulaski County Deputy Sheriff Ryan Jones had responded to South Ky. 1247 near the Cooper Power Plant to check the status of three individuals walking along the road. Upon arrival, the deputy was advised by the woman that she had an active EPO/DVO against Sears -- whom she said had forced her and their child to walk down the highway. The woman further advised, the citation stated, that Sears struck her twice in the face when she attempted to get away and that he had thrown her phone over a guardrail. Sears told the deputy, according to the citation, that he was looking for needles he believed the woman to have.
 At press time, Sears remained lodged to the Pulaski County Detention Center.

“I’d never run before. I used to joke that the only time I’d run was to the chip shop,” he added.
 “But I was absolutely buzzing after that. I realised that I didn’t like the gym so much, but loved being outdoors. I loved cycling and running. Yorkshire is a beautiful place, so there is nothing better than getting out and about.”

With all of the turmoil in the state, they should have a chance to vote again on the Heritage Act — this time to repeal it. Let’s not kick the can down the road.
 In 2000, when the Heritage Act was approved, it got a lot of support because lawmakers who never thought the Confederate flag would be removed from the top of the Statehouse dome saw a ray of hope — and understood that the act would get it down. They pounced on the opportunity, figuring they’d deal with the devils in the deal later. Meanwhile, many white conservatives shelved the whole matter, figuring it had been dealt with.
 But now come killings by police of unarmed black men from North Charleston to Minneapolis to Atlanta. Now comes the Black Lives Matter movement, which has unwound the festering bandage of racism that boils in our nation. Now come protests, unrest and tension in our communities.
 The Heritage Act was a remedy for its time. It has been changed once — in 2015, when lawmakers agreed, after the slaughter of S.C. Sen. Clementa Pinckney and eight members of his church in Charleston, to move the battle flag off the Statehouse grounds into a place of history.
 That’s where all of these monuments now need to go — away from our public places of honor into a museum or educational setting. Now is the time to repeal the Heritage Act once and for all. It’s time for local communities to have conversations, action and change on how they can start healing decades- old racial wounds and come together as a people.
 Carpe diem, state representatives and senators. Deal with the devils in the Heritage Act. Be leaders and help our state to start the healing.

Croatia also stood out as a jewel of their travels to Josh.
 He continued: “We loved Croatia. We’d been through a lot of inland Europe and wanted to see some beaches, so were thrilled to make our way down there.
 “We got a boat and went out onto the crystal clear seas, had some beers in the sun and went swimming. People think of living in your van as just trying to survive each day, but it’s not like that at all – it’s utter freedom.”
 Originally, the couple had planned to be on the road for six months, but disaster struck after just three, when they broke down at the side of a motorway. The van needed a new engine, putting paid to the rest of their plans.

Determined to find a natural treatment to ease her condition, Emilie spent the next two years trying out “every product under the sun”.
 After fearing there was no hope left, everything changed in July 2019 when her mum suggested she tried Balmonds Skin Salvation, costing £7.99 for 30ml.
 “My mum bought me some Balmonds after hearing it was 100 per cent natural and I finally got round to using it,” she said.
 “It was amazing. I started using it on my face and within a week I noticed I was less red and flaky.”
 She continued: “As the weeks passed, my skin became less and less red and, for the first time in years, I didn’t look as flushed. I started using it on my hands and feet during flare-ups and the splits in my skin would be gone in a week.”
 As the redness reduced, by September last year, Emilie felt confident enough to start leaving her house again.

For nearly three-quarters of a century tourism promoters around Burnside have tried to create a Gatlinburg-type recreational complex that would attract millions of visitors.
 Gatlinburg, a mountain town in eastern Tennessee, is known as a gateway to the roughly 520,000-acre Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The area attracts about 11 million visitors a year.
 When Lake Cumberland, during its impoundment in 1951, surrounded Bunker Hill, potential of the historic knob as an island park was immediately recognized. Three local men were sent to Disneyland in California as a committee to borrow secrets to develop Bunker Hill into a tourist attraction.

Dear Reader,
 In the 1940s, just after the Second World War, Mao Zedong was under a lot of pressure from both the US and Russia to talk to the Nationalists, against whom the Chinese Communists were waging a civil war. Mao thereupon held several rounds of talks, but it was just a delaying tactic. He described his strategy as ‘Da, da, tan tan’ or ‘Fight fight, talk talk’, the idea being to buy time, deter aggressive action by the enemy, influence third parties, throw his opponents off-guard and, when the time was ripe, to strike hard militarily. ‘Fight fight, talk talk’ seems to be what is going on at present between China and India at the Line of Actual Control.
 It’s also the strategy adopted by the Chinese vis-à-vis the US, with reports that China plans to accelerate purchases of US farm goods in order to comply with the phase 1 trade deal. An aggressive China now believes its time has come. But does it make sense for India to boycott Chinese goods? Perhaps it doesn’t, but we should be aware of the kind of regime we are up against—reports this week said China's police are collecting blood samples from men and boys across the country to build a genetic map of its 700 million males, a powerful new surveillance tool for the dictatorship.

 "Source a mirror oversized to the hole you cut out, and on the back of the cable spool, mark around the mirror and make sure it’s central.
 "Then I routed out the depth of the mirror and backing board so it was flush to the back of the cable spool.
 "I then set the mirror and backing board in, then using pins, held them in place. Me and my wife fell in love with it straight away - it looked perfect.

A local retired judge is seeking an opportunity to return to the bench.
 Walter F. Maguire of Somerset has a total of 29 years of judicial experience -- averaging about 2,700 cases a year. He's back on the ballot running for the 28th Judicial Circuit, Division I judgeship vacated last November when Judge David Tapp was confirmed to serve on the United States Court of Federal Claims. The unexpired term will runs through 2022.
 Maguire retired in 2013 after serving the 28th Judicial Circuit (Lincoln, Pulaski and Rockcastle counties) as a Family Court judge since 2007. Before that, he was a district judge for the 28th Judicial District (Pulaski and Rockcastle counties) from 1978-82 and 1986-2004.

While the figures show improvement, they suggest the Government has a long way to go to achieve the commitment made by health secretary Matt Hancock on May 15 that "every resident and every member of staff in our elderly care homes in England" would be tested "between now and early June".
 Simon Briscoe, T-Dab director, said: "The rate of testing rose dramatically in the last week of May and into June as the Government sent roughly one million test kits to care homes. The many links in the chain of testing from care home staff, local health officials, a website and test centres, combined to leave testing rates very low.
 "With barely half of residents having been tested it shows that more than simply issuing testing kits is required to provide care homes with the support and guidance they need."
