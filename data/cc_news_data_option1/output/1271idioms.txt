Hopefully a vaccine is developed for COVID-19 in 12 to 18 months, but it is possible it could take two years. What does this mean for people and the economy? I hear a lot of businesses and places like the library closing up with a tentative reopen date like April 24. To me, this is very much double- spoken, and there is a problem with that. I am concerned that our people are not thinking in the long term at all, and in fact are either misinformed and believe it is going to be fixed soon or are in denial of the truth. I am concerned that the economy is not ever going to be fixable. I know flattening the curve makes sense to many sensible people, but it concerns me that this does not provide a long-term answer. Are people really thinking about the prospect of two years? I am not personally impatient to get back to normal ways, as I just see a fallacy of reason going on that I don’t think is being addressed. What do you think?

Oilsands producers in the red as blended bitumen price dips below $4 per barrel

OK, I began this adventure through COVID-19 land as a member of the "Just how far will we go to protect ourselves from ourselves," club, thinking we were taking this whole thing to the extreme.
   
 But just as I was softening my stance and beginning to see the need for the whole social distancing thing, and for cancelling events that draw crowds of people, I heard that Buzzard Sunday scheduled for two weeks ago on March 15 at Hinkley, Ohio, where hundreds, perhaps thousands gather to watch the arrival of the turkey vultures there, was cancelled.
   
 This is the last straw! Does anyone else see the irony of a virus cancelling an event meant to celebrate the arrival of a bird that can eat diseased meat like we eat chocolate cake?
   
 A legend dating back to the turn of the century has it that the famous "Buzzards of Hinckley Ridge" arrive in the town of Hinckley Ohio every March 15 like clockwork.
   
 In the northeast corner of Medina County, just south of Cleveland are a series of cliffs and caverns known locally as old Whipp's Ledges that are a popular roosting and nesting area for turkey vultures. So popular was the legend that in 1957 the first Sunday after March 15 was dubbed Buzzard Sunday and a festival was planned around the event that still takes place today.
   
 Along with the legend of the vulture's timed arrival is the story of how that came to be. The story says that when that area was first settled, farmers began losing livestock left-and-right to bears and wolves that were native to the area.
   
 Finally, the farmers had enough and one fall, a huge mass hunt was organized resembling the coyote drives once popular here in Kansas where hundreds of hunters form a circle surrounding an entire section or township and slowly walk toward each other, tightening the circle. As the circle tightened, wolves, bears, deer and most wildlife in the area were driven toward the center of the circle, where they were shot.
   
 The story goes on to say that after everything was skinned and butchered and all useable meat and hides were taken, the dozens or perhaps hundreds of resulting carcasses were left there for the winter.
   
 In the spring, returning turkey vultures were drawn to the scent and sight of the thawing carcasses, and once there to feed, the numerous natural nesting sites among the cliffs and caverns kept them there for the summer and to this day keep them coming back each year.
   
 Vultures are migratory, heading for Central and South America each fall and returning to our area from mid-March to early April, depending on the weather; we began seeing a few this past week here in McPherson, County.
   
 Favorite roosting places for turkey vultures are the old water towers that some small towns still have. In McPherson, KS a spring or summer evening will often find many roosting on the handrail of the old water tower.
   
 In Marion, KS a couple hundred routinely spend days soaring over the town and roosting on the water tower hand rail at night.
   
 Turkey vultures are amazing birds, the main employees of God's cleanup crew that can in fact eat diseased meat without any ill effects. I often wonder what it would be like to glide and soar above the earth like they can.
   
 Everyone likes a good legend, and who knows what about Hinckley's past that drew the buzzards there in the first place is true, and how much is just legend. One thing for sure is that vultures do arrive in Hinckley Ohio like clockwork every March 15, which this year also happened to be Buzzard Sunday.
   
 As an ex-Buckeye myself, I hope to take Joyce there some year to enjoy the spectacle, even if it means Enjoying Kansas Outdoors from afar.

Freshman Avery Broughton, who led Corsica-Stickney to a 24-0 record and berth in the semifinals of the state B tourney before it was suspended, is the Class B Player of the Year and leads a group of first-teamers that includes seniors Hilary Albrecht of Howard and Ady Dwight of Langford Area and juniors Caelyn Valandra-Prue of White River, Alayna Benike of Castlewood and Cameryn Logan of Ethan.
 Broughton, a 5-foot-11 forward, averaged 20.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game for Corsica-Stickney.
 Broughton surpassed the 1,000-point mark in her third year on the varsity and — with 1,200 career points — is only 79 points shy of the school’s scoring record. She moved up to the first team after earning second-team All-State honors as an eighth-grader.
 “Avery has a love for the game that makes it easy to coach her,” said Avery’s mother and Corsica- Stickney head coach Lorisa Broughton. “She is a leader and motivator on the floor and demonstrates a high basketball IQ for her age.”
 Albrecht, a 5-9 senior guard, closed out a five-year career as a starter by leading Howard to a 20-4 record and the school’s first state-tournament appearance in 25 years. It’s the third All-State honor for Albrecht — a second-team selection in 2018 and a third-team honoree last winter.
 The Dordt College recruit produced 19.1 points and 11.4 rebounds this winter for the Tigers and finished her career as the school’s all-time leader in points (1,723) and steals (332).
 “Hilary has been a key component of the turnaround of our program,” said Howard head coach Wade Erickson. “She is at her best off penetration, but can also shoot it from deep and is physical enough to play inside.”
 Valandra-Prue is the lone repeat first-team selection from last year and the 5-9 guard-forward earned the honor again despite having her season cut short by a knee injury.
 Her season numbers included 31 points, seven rebounds, four steals and four assists per game. She also broke the legendary SuAnne Big Crow’s scoring record in the Lakota Nation Invitational, producing 136 points including a 45-point outburst against Pine Ridge on the final day.
 “Caelyn continues to work on her strength and getting back for next season,” said White River coach Kristi Barnhart. “She brings level of play to our team that makes everyone better.”
 Dwight, a 6-0 center, recorded 24.3 points and 13.4 rebounds for a Langford Area team that had a solid 19-4 season end with a loss to Irene-Wakonda in the SoDak 16 state qualifier.
 A five-year starter, Dwight finished her career with 1,790 points and 1,043 rebounds and shared co-most valuable player honors in the Lake Region Conference this year. Also a talented volleyball player, she will continue with that sport in the fall at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell.
 “Ady is a tremendous all-around player,” said Langford Area coach Michael Alberts. “Ady was very hard to stop on the offensive end this year, really stepped up her defense and turned into a great leader on and off the court.”
 Benike, a 5-foot-11 junior forward, displayed her ability to play both inside and outside for a Castlewood team that went 18-5 and reached the semifinals of the state tournament. She moved up the first team after earning second-team All-State honors as a sophomore.
 A starter on Castlewood’s state championship team in 2018, she averaged 16.1 points, 8 rebounds, 6 assists and three steals per game this winter.
 “Alayna is such a versatile player. She handles the ball, is a great passer and can shoot inside or out,” said Castlewood head coach Leslie Tvedt. “She does a great job of rebounding and pushing the ball up the court.”
 Benike’s play helped Castlewood open the state tournament with a win over an Ethan team that is 22-2 so far this season and has been led by Logan.
 The 5-foot-10 junior averaged 15 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game this winter. A three-year starter she has helped the Rusters to a combined 68-6 record and three state-tournament appearances.
 “Cameryn has shown significant improvement each year she has been on the varsity and I believe she has the potential to become an even better player,” said Ethan coach Tom Young. “She is an outstanding young person on and off the floor and I have enjoyed being her coach.”
 The second team includes junior Morgan Edelman, a second-team honoree in 2019 and junior Halle Heinz of Ipswich and senior Lavin Bendt of Kadoka Area, who were third-team selections a year ago. Other second-teamers are junior Kennedy Leiferman of Kimball-White Lake and sophomores Zoey Wohlleber of Waubay-Summit and Kaycee Groves of Faith.
 Sisters Malloy O’Malley, a senior, and Nora O’Malley of Irene-Wakonda spearhead the third team that includes seniors Morgan Huber of Hanson and Brooke Niederbaumer of Faulkton Area, junior Rachel Fiedler of Herreid/Selby Area and sophomores Kennadi Buchholz of De Smet and Julia Weber of Bridgewater-Emery.

Neither set of calculations include the cost of transporting the crude — Murphy said just the cost of sending the oil by pipeline from its source in northern Alberta to the Hardisty marketing hub in central Alberta would put almost every barrel in the red.
 As much as 20 per cent or 340,000 barrels per day of thermal oilsands production could be shut down, Murphy said.
 Dunn estimated the curtailments will total a "few hundred thousand barrels per day," but the technical hazards of shutting down and restarting steamed oilsands wells means operators will have to continue to produce bitumen at a slower rate.
 The reduction of demand for oil in North America means Western Canadian crude storage is rapidly filling, he said.
 The situation is made worse by deferrals of planned spring maintenance shutdowns at some oilsands mine upgraders to avoid adding maintenance staff to the workforce due to COVID-19 transmission worries, he added.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control announced the area's first coronavirus-related death Monday afternoon. DHEC said the person was an elderly Beaufort County resident who had underlying health conditions.
   
 DHEC also announced 24 additional coronavirus cases in Beaufort County, the county's largest daily increase to date. Beaufort County had 74 total cases and Jasper County still had three confirmed cases as of Monday.
   
 DHEC did not respond to a request for more details about the deceased Beaufort County resident before press time Monday.
   
 "We're all in this together," DHEC physician Dr. Brannon Traxler said. "Today's announcement is a stark reminder of the serious threat that COVID-19 poses to our families, friends, and communities. We encourage all South Carolinians to continue to listen to the guidance of our public health professionals and to, when possible, stay home and limit your close contact with others."
   
 DHEC reported 151 additional statewide cases Monday, bringing the total to 925 cases in 41 counties. DHEC's coronavirus webpage, scdhec.gov/COVID-19, is updated daily with a map of positive cases and the most current recommendations for protecting against the virus.
   
 "We recognize that this is a challenging time and that what we're calling on everyone across our state to do is not easy," Traxler said. "But the risk of inaction is far too great. If we all don't follow the guidance for social distancing and staying home, then we can anticipate seeing higher rates of cases similar to what we've seen in other states."
   
 All South Carolinians are encouraged to stay home and minimize contact with people outside their households to prevent the spread of the disease. Everyone is encouraged to monitor themselves for symptoms, practice social distancing, avoid touching frequently touched items, and regularly wash their hands.
   
 Anyone with concerns about their health should reach out to their healthcare provider or use the telehealth services provided by several health care systems. For telehealth options and the latest information about DHEC's coronavirus response efforts, go to scdhec.gov/COVID-19.

 New state mandates
   
 Lowcountry police have begun enforcing Gov. Henry McMaster's state of emergency directives, including those that ban public gatherings of three or more people and require visitors from coronavirus "hotspot" states to self- quarantine for two weeks upon arrival.
   
 On Monday, officials from the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office, Bluffton Police Department and Jasper County Sheriff's Office reported that they hadn't issued any citations thus far but officers have needed to break up some small gatherings.
   
 "We've dispersed crowds of three or more people and they've been cooperative," Beaufort County Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Bob Bromage said.
   
 Bluffton Police Department Capt. Joe Babkiewicz said the same has been true for his department. Most of the incidents in which officers have asked crowds to disperse have occurred outside of stores, in the park or in the Old Town Bluffton area, he said.
   
 Detective Sgt. Jake Higgins, spokesperson for the Jasper County Sheriff's Office, said the department has been without any incidents so far.
   
 "JCSO has not any violations that needed to be enforced," he said. "Jasper residents understand the mandates and respect the role we have as law enforcement.
   
 "We have encouraged people to keep using physical distance and not to group with more than three people. We are still in an education phase of the mandate and do not anticipate having to switch to the enforcement phase."
   
 Babkiewicz and Bromage noted their officers are instructed to educate rather than enforce unless people are not being compliant.
   
 "Our priority is education, education, education and citation as a last resort," Babkiewicz said.
   
 The challenge of enforcing McMaster's directive regarding "hotspots" is police have no way of knowing if a person has visited one of the four cited areas: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and New Orleans, La.
   
 "The method that we're using at this point is if we receive a complaint that somebody is out and from one of the hotspots, then we look into it," Bromage said.
   
 Bromage said he's received word of "at least one report" in which a seasonal resident of Beaufort County was getting notes of a harassing nature stuck to his or her car by neighbors.
   
 "The basic on that is this person feels they're being harassed, that they've been here long before coronavirus [directives] had been issued and that they're not in violation of the quarantine," he said.
   
 Bromage did not offer additional comment on the incident.
   
 "By and large, we've found that people are following social distancing seriously and when we find a large gathering, they disperse and are cooperative," he said. "The vast majority of people are mindful of the importance of social distancing and the importance of curbing the spread of COVID-19."

Part one of virtual race week in Bristol will unfold tonight at 9 with 40 of the world's best sim (simulated) racers competing on eNASCAR.com and YouTube.
 “I don’t know what to expect, but Bristol will definitely be a show,” said Bolton in a phone interview Monday. “I’ve been practicing for this on and off the past two weekends while working on my setup. I’ll try to gain speed that way.”
 The world of iRacing is not about raw horsepower, sleek car design or courage. It’s a technical challenge where clever competitors factor in equations such as tire pressure, camber, track bar and springs.
 Bolton knows his sport from all sides.
 He grew up racing real late models and Legends cars, winning the 2013 Fall Classic at Hickory Motor Speedway in a limited late model.
 “I was also using iRacing as a way to adjust to different tracks and cars,” Bolton said. “Eventually I had to make money rather than spend it, but iRacing is as close as you can get to strapping into a real car.”
 Like nearly everyone else in the NASCAR community, Bolton watched the nationally-televised Pro Invitational Series events from the virtual versions of Homestead-Miami and Texas Motor Speedway the past two weeks.
 “It’s been great to see how the sport has come together and offered something to help people relax and have fun for a couple hours,” Bolton said. “The tracks and cars in iRacing are identical down to the millimeter. Really, everything is very similar.”
 The Bristol Pro Invitational event will be shown live on Fox this Sunday afternoon.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration rolled backed ambitious Obama-era vehicle mileage standards Tuesday, raising the ceiling on damaging fossil fuel emissions for years to come and gutting one of the United States' biggest efforts against climate change.The Trump administration released a final rule Tuesday on mileage standards through 2026. The change — after two years of Trump threatening and fighting states and a faction of automakers that opposed the move — waters down a tough Obama mileage standard that would have encouraged automakers to ramp up production of electric vehicles and more fuel-efficient gas and diesel vehicles."We are delivering on President Trump’s promise to correct the current fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards,” Andrew Wheeler, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement Tuesday marking the release.He said the final rule “puts in place a sensible” national program that "strikes the right regulatory balance that protects our environment, and sets reasonable targets for the auto industry. This rule supports our economy, and the safety of American families.”Opponents contend the change — gutting his predecessor's legacy effort against climate-changing fossil fuel emissions — appears driven by Trump's push to undo regulatory initiatives of former President Barack Obama and say even the administration has had difficulty pointing to the kind of specific, demonstrable benefits to drivers, public health and safety or the economy that normally accompany standards changes.The Trump administration says the looser mileage standards will allow consumers to keep buying the less fuel-efficient SUVs that U.S. drivers have favored for years. Opponents say it will kill several hundred more Americans a year through dirtier air, compared to the Obama standards.Even “given the catastrophe they’re in with the coronavirus, they're pursuing a policy that's going to hurt public health and kill people," said Chet France, a former 39-year veteran of the EPA, where he served as a senior official over emissions and mileage standards.“This is first time that an administration has pursued a policy that will net negative benefit for society and reduce fuel savings," France said.Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, called it “the height of irresponsibility for this administration to finalize a rollback that will lead to dirtier air while our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution.In Phoenix, meanwhile, resident Columba Sainz expressed disappointment at the prospect of losing the Obama-era rule, which she had hoped would allow her preschool age children to break away from TV indoors and play outside more. Sainz reluctantly limited her daughter to a half-hour at the park daily, after the girl developed asthma, at age 3, at their home a few minutes from a freeway.“I cried so many times," Sainz said. “How do you tell your daughter she can't be outside because of air pollution?"Trump's Cabinet heads have continued a push to roll back public health and environment regulations despite the coronavirus outbreak riveting the world's attention. The administration — like others before it — is facing procedural rules that will make changes adopted before the last six months of Trump's current term tougher to throw out, even if the White House changes occupants.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has been the main agency drawing up the new rules, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.Earlier drafts of the mileage rollback have shown the administration struggling to justify relaxing the mileage standards. Trump officials contend vehicles will be cheaper for Americans to buy, because automakers will have saved on emissions-cutting technology. Former EPA emissions officials say the cost of more fuel, and costs like increased healthcare bills from the extra pollution, cancel out any sticker savings.The standards have split the auto industry with Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen siding with California and agreeing to higher standards. Most other automakers contend the Obama-era standards were enacted hastily and will be impossible to meet because consumers have shifted dramatically away from efficient cars to SUVs and trucks.California and about a dozen other states say they will continue resisting the Trump standards in court.Last year, 72% of the new vehicles purchased by U.S. consumers were trucks or SUVS. It was 51% when the current standards went into effect in 2012.The Obama administration mandated 5% annual increases in fuel economy. Leaked versions of the Trump administration's latest proposal show a 1.5% annual increase, backing off from its initial proposal simply to stop mandating increases in fuel efficiency after 2020.The transportation sector is the nation's largest source of climate-changing emissions.John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing automakers, said the industry still wants middle ground between the two standards, and it supports year-over-year mileage increases. But he says the Obama-era standards are outdated due to the drastic shift to trucks and SUVs.The Trump administration standards are likely to cause havoc in the auto industry because, with legal challenges expected, automakers won’t know which standards they will have to obey.“It will be extraordinarily disruptive,” said Richard J. Pierce Jr., a law professor at the George Washington University who specializes in government regulations.States and environmental groups will challenge the Trump rules, and a U.S. District Court likely will issue a temporary order shelving them until it decides whether they are legal. The temporary order likely will be challenged with the Supreme Court, which in recent cases has voted 5-4 that a District judge can’t issue such a nationwide order, Pierce said. But the nation’s highest court could also keep the order in effect if it determines the groups challenging the Trump standards are likely to win.“We’re talking quite a long time, one to three years anyway, before we can expect to get a final decision on the merits,” Pierce said.——Krisher reported from Detroit.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Rob Smith, assistant superintendent for Alpine School District, explained in a phone interview on Monday that a new law regarding student fees is an adjustment to try to make things work better.
 “I think trying to provide more transparency, more understanding of how revenue is coming in and being spent, I think that is the intent,” Smith said. “It’s trying to make sure students have equitable opportunities to participate. Time will tell what impact this will have but in many cases, programs and schools will be operating in similar ways to how they have been operating.”
 In 2019, Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield, sponsored House Bill 250: School Fee Revisions. After going through the legislative process, the bill passed and was signed into law, requiring all school districts to adhere to its guidelines.
 “The bill phased in changes to our school fees over a three-year period of time,” Smith said. “We are in Year 1 complying with that. Part of that process is to adopt a compliant fee schedule. All fees, charges, etc., that a school district levies must be reviewed by the board with two opportunities for the public to have comment.”
 The second opportunity for discussion of the 2020-21 fee plans for those living in Alpine School District boundaries will be at Tuesday night's school board meeting, which is scheduled to be held electronically beginning at 6 p.m. Go to Alpineschools.org to participate.
 Every school is required to create spend plans for all of its activities and programs.
 “The whole goal behind that is to basically create a budget,” Smith said. “Here is the amount of money we are going to get in, here is the source of the money whether from fundraisers or fees, and then here is how we are going to spend it. Each program will be transparent in the way that it receives and spends money for students that participate and their parents.”

The Amish do their best to keep outside troubles from entering their daily lives. That’s not so easy when the trouble is an invisible virus spreading across the globe.
 People familiar with the Amish community in Pennsylvania say many are taking the coronavirus and subsequent business closures and calls for social distancing very seriously. But other Amish, just like some of their “English” counterparts, are not.
 “A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to about 30 Amish families (about coronavirus) and there was a great degree of skepticism about it,” said Phil Lapp, a Mennonite who grew up among the Amish in Lancaster County and now gives tours there. “Over the past couple of days, though, I would say a majority are adhering to the call to stay home, but 10 to 20% are extremely upset about the outside world impacting their livelihood.”
 While Lancaster County has 33 confirmed COVID-19 cases, Craig Lehman, a county commissioner, said Thursday he was unaware of any among the Amish.
 Pennsylvania, according to AmishAmerica.com, leads the nation with 53 Amish settlements, and Lancaster County, where the Amish population tops 26,000, has the highest concentration. While attitudes about medicine and preventative care can differ even between individual families, they will seek it out in emergencies.
 Last week, the Pennsylvania Office of Rural Health at Penn State University sent out a letter intended to reach Amish and Old Order Mennonite farmers that discussed the coronavirus, as well as a news release titled “Plain Communities Can Protect Themselves Against COVID-19.” Steve Nolt, an Elizabethtown College professor who has studied Amish society for decades, said the release would have been picked up by agricultural publications.
 “Please take this virus seriously. Your family’s life may depend on it,” the letter urged. “Some think that this virus is a political ploy, but that is a misconception and people of all political parties are dying.”
 It quoted Dr. Holmes Morton, who founded the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg in 1989 and now operates a similar center in Belleville, Mifflin County. He specializes in genetic disorders of Amish and Mennonite communities, including “maple syrup urine disease,” in which the body is unable to process certain protein amino acids. Nolt said Morton is revered by the Amish and other Plain sects, and that they would listen to his warnings.
 “A gathering of hundreds of people at a fundraising dinner or benefit auction could easily become the source of an outbreak of COVID-19 in the (Amish and Mennonite) community,” Morton said in the letter.
 Two weeks ago, elected officials called for the cancellation of the popular Gordonville “Mud Sale,” one of many large spring auctions that take place in Plain communities. The event was not postponed.
 The March 17 edition of the Fishwrapper, a newspaper popular among the Amish and Mennonites, featured an editorial stating that the coronavirus “has people running scared. What is it they fear? They worry they will pick up the virus. They panic when they think how it could affect them if they contract it. They listen to news reports that vary in their presentation _ one promoting it as something to be feared and the other as nothing to worry about.”
 Nolt said certain aspects of Amish life could put them at greater risk for catching and spreading the coronavirus. Amish church services are held on Sunday mornings inside homes, with sometimes up to 175 people in one house, and can last three hours. The men usually gather outside beforehand, he said, and all of them shake hands.
 “There’s a different sense of personal space,” he said.
 There’s also a higher likelihood that Amish homes have elderly family members living in them with their children. “It’s very rare for older Amish folks to live in retirement or nursing homes,” Nolt said.
 Lehman said there have been outreach efforts by the county to talk to the Amish about the coronavirus.
 “The most recent update was that some of them are definitely getting the message. We got word that last week, church had been canceled up to two weeks,” Lehman said. “Word was sent out to the Amish to reduce the size of weddings or postpone them if possible.”
 That sentiment was also relayed in the letter Penn State sent out to the communities. “Avoid auctions, weddings, fundraising banquets, shaking hands, and even church for the time being,” it warned.
 Nolt said canceling church comes at a particularly bad time for the Amish. They share communion just twice a year, one in autumn, the other in spring. The spring communion is approaching soon.
 “There’s probably going to be even more resistance to canceling church because of it,” he said.
 The Mennonite World Review said on March 16 that Mennonite services would be held online throughout North America.
 On Thursday, Lapp, the tour operator, was helping deliver fabric masks the Amish are making to the Lancaster Health Center. The masks are being sewn at Bird-in-Hand Fabric, and while not medical grade, they are “better than nothing.” he said.
 The Amish are reading newspapers and know what’s happening, but “at the same time, they’re not wearing masks, they’re not social distancing themselves, and I do fear for their elderly.”

The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday said 157 people from the state attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, claiming that most of them have been traced. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said "95 per cent" of this number have been traced and are being tested for coronavirus. The tests so far have come out negative, he said.
 Awasthi’s press briefing came a few hours after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath cut short a western Utter Pradesh trip, rushing back to Lucknow to take stock of the possible fallout of the Nizamnuddin congregation. "People are being tracked. Their testing has to be done. If they are tested positive, they will be quarantined and given treatment," Awasthi said, adding that the chief minister has directed not to show any laxity in this regard. He also urged people who attended the gathering to get themselves tested.
 "People should themselves turn up before the administration for testing. This is in their interest, their relatives and the society," he said. Awasthi added that action will be initiated against those violating gathering restrictions, appealing to people to inform police about such persons. "They will be first counselled, and if necessary, action will be initiated against them," he said.
 Earlier in the morning, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited Ghaziabad, but called off the rest of the trip. He headed back to Lucknow meet senior officers and review quarantine measures, after reports that a meeting organised by Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi's Nizamuddin may have infected many people from the state, an official said. Twenty-four people, who took part in a religious congregation in Nizamuddin West earlier this month, have tested positive for coronavirus, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday.
 "An estimated 700 people, who attended this congregation, have been quarantined while around 335 people have been admitted to hospitals," he told reporters, referring to the situation in Delhi. In Hyderabad, the Telangana government late Monday said six people who attended the congregation between March 13 and 15 died due to coronavirus.
 Thousands of people, including foreigners, visited the Jamaat premises over the past month, triggering fears now that they have spread the virus..

There is a savage irony in the way the Democratic Party closed ranks around Biden just as Covid-19 appeared on the scene. A month ago, it seemed that 2020 might be the year Americans would finally blow away the well-funded smoke and mirrors of the for-profit U.S. health insurance industry and achieve universal publicly funded healthcare. Instead, Democratic leaders appear to be settling for the lesser evil of another humiliating defeat and four more years of Trump over (to their minds) the greater danger of a Sanders presidency and universal healthcare.

German Bundesliga clubs on Tuesday approved measures to suspend the season for a further four weeks due to the coronavirus crisis, amid reports that games would resume from the first weekend in May.
 German Football League (DFL) directors announced plans last week to extend the current two-week suspension until April 30, a decision approved by Germany’s 36 professional clubs in a video conference on Tuesday.
 “The board felt a lot of support (from the clubs),” said DFL president Christian Seifert, adding that league was “sticking together”.
 Games had been halted since mid-March, but hopes are growing that they might resume a month from now.
 Earlier Tuesday, _Kicker_ weekly had reported that the DFL now planned to resume the season from the first weekend of May, with games to be played behind closed doors.
 Seifert did not confirm the reports, but said it was “still the case that we want to end the season by June 30”.
 Failure to complete the 2019/20 season would leave some clubs facing an “existential threat” in June due to the loss of crucial TV rights revenues, he added.
 The DFL president said that clubs were looking into how to host games with the fewest number of people present, but insisted there was still “no single plan”.
 He warned that games may have to be held behind closed doors “into next season and maybe even until the end of the year”.
 He added that scheduling was further complicated by the demands of other European leagues and federations, and called for “flexibility”.
 “The next season that will take place in the way we are accustomed to will be 2021/22.”
 In other measures agreed Tuesday, the DFL also relaxed its stringent league licensing rules, which see clubs docked nine points if they declare insolvency.

The University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine maintains a “digital encyclopedia” about the 1918 pandemic called the Influenza Archives. It documents, often quite colorfully, how 50 cities responded to the outbreak. Each one is somewhat different — Los Angeles had to deal with restrictions on filming “mob scenes” in early Hollywood — but ultimately they all tell very similar tales.
 St. Louis is often held up as a model to follow — it imposed restrictions earlier than most cities, and wound up having one of the lowest death rates in the country. Those restrictions also weren’t popular. On Oct. 8, the city’s health commissioner — termed “energetic” in these accounts — closed schools, churches, theaters, movie houses and banned all public gatherings. Other businesses could remain open but as infections rose, health commissioner Max Starkloff restricted their hours and directed stores to cease advertising Saturday sales that drew crowds downtown. “The business community immediately vocalized its opposition to the restricted business hours,” the archives say. Mayor Henry Kiel also was getting heat from ministers who objected to the ban on church services. He proposed a two-day trial reprieve; the city’s doctors were adamantly opposed. The mayor still kept pressing for the restrictions to be lifted. “In fact,” the report says, “Starkloff enacted even stricter measures. Starting on Nov. 2, he placed policemen in department stores and five-and-ten shops to keep crowds moving. A week later, on Nov. 9, he issued a sweeping proclamation immediately closing all non-essential stores, businesses, and factories for four days in a drastic attempt to stamp out the epidemic once and for all.” At that point, businesses complained even louder. On Nov. 17, the flu had abated, and St. Louis finally lifted its restrictions — five weeks after the first ones had been imposed. Ten days later, the flu came back, and so did many of the restrictions. Even though that flu hit young people the most, the school superintendent wanted schools reopened on the grounds that students had already missed too much school. The health authorities resisted such pressure; the second wave of restrictions weren’t completely lifted until Dec. 28 and classes finally resumed on Jan. 2.

Cancelling Wimbledon is the only realistic option open to organisers as they grapple with the chaos caused by the coronavirus, says two-time Grand Slam men’s doubles champion Jamie Murray.
 Tennis is at a standstill until June 7, with the entire European clay-court season already wiped out and the only Grand Slam event played on grass is expected to be officially cancelled on Wednesday.
 Wimbledon organisers have ruled out playing the two-week tournament, slated to run from June 29 to July 12, behind closed doors. The French Open has already been postponed, shoehorned into the schedule in late September, and it will be difficult for Wimbledon to rearrange.
 Murray, a Wimbledon men’s doubles finalist in 2015 and a two-time mixed doubles champion, said postponing the tournament presented a series of hurdles, including shorter evenings.
 “I think for them, it’s difficult to move the tournament back because you’re running into other tournaments that are for the moment still on the schedule,” the 34-year-old Scotsman told the _BBC_ on Tuesday.
 “And also just things like daylight to host the event. Each week that passes, you get less and less light to play the tournament. Obviously they play until nine and 10 o’clock each night at Wimbledon.” Murray, whose younger brother Andy is a two-time Wimbledon singles champion, is kicking his heels in the absence of tennis.
 “I’m just at home, taking the necessary precautions, and trying to stay as active as I can,” he said. “It’s different. We’re used to being on the road all the time, used to being in different cities every week, and you kind of become institutionalised to that.”

The allowances are meant to help players cover costs for housing, food and training. Most players were instructed to leave their spring training complexes just over two weeks ago, sending them scrambling to make ends meet because they hadn't received a paycheck from teams since the end of the 2019 season. Exceptions were made for players from Venezuela and other high-risk areas, many of whom remained at the spring camps.
