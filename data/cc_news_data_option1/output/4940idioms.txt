“Regardless of when people go back to the office, I think people have grown comfortable with what they’re wearing,” Magid said. “I just can’t see people giving away the feeling of comfort.”
 The retail landscape is changing with the new needs of the remote worker. Bankruptcies this year included Brooks Brothers and the owner of Ann Taylor and Loft. Rent the Runway closed all of its stores and removed its unlimited subscription option. In Gap Inc.’s latest quarter, net sales soared 15% at Old Navy and 35% at Athleta while plummeting 34% at Banana Republic.
 Gap named a new head of Banana Republic last week and said on an earnings call that the brand had been “working hard to update its product assortment” for an era of remote work, favoring more casual clothes over tailored garments and suiting.
 Professional women have long been a lucrative market. Retailers see them as customers who tend to have money to spend and are willing to pay for apparel that will help them feel confident in the workplace, fit into busy lifestyles or offer up the right look for a “desk to dinner” sort of day. The attire is often dry-clean only, stiffer and more structured than weekend clothes, and modest in neckline and hemline. Many of those products — and how they are marketed — have now changed.
 Last fall, Banana Republic’s site and social media featured colorful heels and models wearing “quintessential Banana Republic with a modern twist — think cozy cable knits and Italian corduroy, double-breasted plaid blazers and moleskin jackets.” This season, its site includes looks for virtual interviews and a “work leisure” section, with soft ponte leggings, turtleneck sweater dresses, cheetah-print socks and “coatigans.”
 Some women appear to be clearing out office attire from their closets through donations and resales. The RealReal said consignments of work dresses more than doubled between Aug. 1 and Oct. 15 compared with the same period last year, exceeding significant jumps in consignments of cocktail dresses and evening dresses. On Poshmark, listings of women’s blazers and suit jackets from July to Sept. 30 jumped 30% from a year earlier, while listings of women’s pencil skirts rose 32%.

Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

Right now, we face a much greater enemy than COVID-19. We face an internet- enabled industrial-scale fakes new and misinformation onslaught. State actors and misinformation entrepreneurs peddle fake news, lies, propaganda with a view to gaining power and wealth. They see major opportunities in a customer segment that is irrational, emotional and cult-like. Cults are one of the biggest business opportunities of the 21st century, and cult branding is the new innovation.


  The science establishment was slow to recognize that COVID-19 was airborne. Consequently advice on ventilation was not developed quickly enough. It was also slow to recognize new symptoms such as loss of smell and taste. In the early days, there was contradictory advice in relation to the use of masks. Some of the data modeling that occurred was naïve and lacked an understanding of the real world. There were arguments from certain scientists promoting pseudoscience such as herd immunity.


  Good science undermines cults and promotes reason. Poor science facilitates, encourages and legitimizes cults because it gives the propaganda entrepreneurs some nasty truth to mix with their fake news.


  Some of the science was misguided and wrong. Some of our scientific establishments were too slow, cautious, and overly influenced by politics. Some were promoting eugenics-style cull-the-herd approaches under the guise of herd immunity.


  Politicians who said they were “being led by the science” did a disservice to science by their pandering. For politics to work it must be a jack of all trades because society is always more complex than one discipline or group.


  We should no more believe that science has all the answers than that God has all the answers. We do a disservice to science and society when we hold up scientists as our new all-knowing gods. They are fallible and need to be questioned. We must demand of them that they recognize and learn from their mistakes.


  The internet is a cult-making machine. Much of the tech industry’s business model is fake news, fake engagement. We must rein in the worsts elements of the internet. A robust, evidence-based, science-informed, societal-level approach can do that.

Fear is nothing new for the young couple, as Brandi has an extremely rare metabolic disorder that requires round-the-clock care and makes her vulnerable to any kind of virus.
 She's already a walking miracle. Most children with her condition don't live past the age of one.
 But the pandemic has made it even harder to keep her alive. Garcia and Lusk haven't been working and fear that it could introduce coronavirus into their home.
 They're now thousands of dollars in debt and face eviction at the end of the month.
 Brandi's parents are like so many people with a vulnerable family member who have made huge sacrifices to protect them for months and months -- and who are looking at many weeks more as Covid-19 continues to spread.
 But it's hard to explain that to Brandi's brother and sister who can't safely go to school or even be around other children. Young friends hang on their apartment patio railings and call for Isabella, 5, and Elijah, 6, to come out to the playground next door. But it's too risky to say yes.
 "We try to explain it to them," said Garcia, 29. "They're like, 'Oh, well I was good today. I didn't do nothing wrong.' It's like, I know you didn't do nothing wrong. It's just ... you're not able to go outside."
 Brandi has carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency, a serious condition where her body cannot use certain types of fats as a source of energy. She must be fed through a tube in her stomach every few hours and she's on a long list of expensive medicines.
 Her body has almost no reserves to fight a virus.
 "Any acute illness could be deadly for her," said Dr. Luis Umaña, a pediatric genetic and metabolic specialist at Children's Health in Dallas and assistant professor at UT Southwestern.
 "Covid is so contagious and so widespread, that is at the top of our list of things that she could easily contract," said Umaña, who is Brandi's doctor. "For other ones, I mean, she gets vaccines right now. We don't have a vaccine for the coronavirus yet -- at least available."
 Umaña said fewer than 1 in 250,000 babies are born with CACT deficiency and it requires an "overwhelming amount of effort" to treat, even during normal times. "She will never be really out of the woods," he said. "Any time in her life something could go wrong, and that could be it for her."
 Families like Brandi's have found themselves in a "no-win situation" during the pandemic, Umaña observed. "They would have to take the risk (of working), or not be able to afford their basic needs."

The majority of the county’s public school students plan to return to the classroom in January, according to preliminary enrollment figures released this week.
 Pitt County Schools expects more than 16,000 of its 23,000 students to be on campus at least part time for the spring semester, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 6. That’s an increase of more than 15 percent over fall semester and will bring more than 3,500 additional learners to the district’s 38 school campuses.
 “Right now we are looking at about 70 percent face-to-face,” Pitt County Schools Public Information Officer Jennifer Johnson said. “We started school this year with about 50 percent.”
 Johnson said many families of full-time virtual students surveyed last month opted to move their children to face-to-face instruction for the second half of the school year.
 “We understand that some of those parents who want (their children) to come back to school are those who made the decision very early in the summer and now realize that virtual education maybe is not something they can sustain, or they realize their student needs more help,” she said. “That’s why we opened up this (next) semester.”
 The percentages of in-person and full-time virtual learners enrolled for spring semester vary from school to school, ranging from about 50 percent full-time virtual enrollment at Ayden Middle and South Central High schools to more than 85 percent face-to-face enrollment at South Greenville Elementary, Chicod and G.R. Whitfield schools.
 Ten schools expect to have no more than 65 percent of their learners on campus, while in-person enrollment is expected to be 80 percent or higher at 10 other schools in the district. As of Nov. 25, about 54 percent of students in the district were on-campus learners.
 Since October, in-person elementary learners have been permitted to attend classes each Tuesday through Friday. Mondays through the end of March are remote learning days for all students.
 Most middle school and high school learners alternate weeks of on-campus and virtual instruction in order to maintain 6 feet of distancing required by the state to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
   
 “At the local level we can be more restrictive, but we can’t be less restrictive than the latest executive order,” Johnson said.
 She said that with increasing numbers of students wanting to return to face- to-face learning, some middle school and high school students who previously had been on campus every week may have to return to hybrid instruction for the spring semester.
 “There are some schools that have invited others face to face before now, including middle and high schools if they had space,” Johnson said. “We may have some people who were going A and B week that may have to go back to A week/B week.
 “This may mean that students have to change schedules or they have to change buses again,” she said. “They may have to change teachers.”
 Johnson said the change in attendance also will mean that some teachers who were assigned to either face-to-face or virtual students will begin teaching both groups of learners.
 She said some schools may need to change or rearrange classrooms to remain in compliance with distancing requirements, but no schools plan to add mobile units to accommodate additional learners.
 Since classes resumed in August, there have been a total of 135 school- affected cases of COVID-19 reported in the district. The largest number recorded in a single week was 18, reported Nov. 20-26.
 “We’re making sure that we are following protocols,”Johnson said. “So far we’ve been able to keep our numbers low or not have spread within our schools.”
 On-campus learners are allowed to change to full-time virtual instruction at any time during the semester. Students who select full-time virtual enrollment for the spring will continue online learning through June 2021.

The Electoral Officer for the Kassena-Nankana Municipal Assembly in the Upper East Region, Tetteh Ankama Okyne, has suggested the provision of nose masks at Polling Centres as one of the best interventions against the spread of the deadly Coronavirus Disease during the election.      He said nose masks should be provided at Polling centres which can be supplied to electorates who turn up to participate in the election without masks .      Mr. Tetteh noted that when such provisions are made it would help the EC reduce the chances of infection of the CORONAVIRUS Disease at the centres.      The Electoral Officer who made the suggestion based on observations he made during the Special Voting at the Navrongo Central Constituency, said the provision would also enable people who arrive at the centres with the masks exercise their franchise with interruption.      He therefore appealed to government to assist the Electoral Commission to provide nose masks so that the process on December 7, 2020 can be smooth.      On the close of polls at the centre, Mr. Tetteh revealed that 553 Special Voters turned out for the exercise out of a total of 622 in the constituency.

This country has lost its railway infrastructure in the 1970’s. President Kufour made a big effort to restore railway infrastructure and rail transport with the revival of the Accra-Tema and Accra-Nsawam line.      Under President Mahama, this important and crucial transport infrastructure was put on the back burner. Candidate Akufo Addo promised in 2016 to take railway transport into a whole new level. Today, under President Akufo Addo, our beloved country is well on course to restore railway infrastructure and rail transport as never seen since the 1960’s. Four more for Nana is a vote for the orderly development of rail infrastructure and transport for our dear country.      FREE WIFI      Vice President Dr. Bawumia just last week outlined the great effort of President Akufo Addo to bequeath a digital economy and society, to particularly the youth, who are our future. Wifi connectivity is key in this endeavour.      President Akufo Addo has embarked on infrastructure to provide free wifi in our schools. A vote for him is a vote for free wifi for our youth.      CRISIS LEADERSHIP      Another clear difference between President Akufo Addo and John Mahama is clear in the leadership qualities in a crisis. The Dumsor crisis from 2013, gave the Ghanaian people evidence of President Mahama’s leadership skills in crisis. The crisis devastated business and personal lives in Ghana. President Mahama in 2013 to 2016 provided no relief, either to businesses or individual victims of Dumsor, including families who suffered from death of family members.      What President Mahama offered to Ghanaians was false promise after false promise after false promise of solution to Dumsor. The contrast to the crisis leadership qualities of President Akufo Addo during the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be starker. President Akufo Addo by his communication style, galvanized the entire nation behind him in navigating through this crisis.      Interventions that have included free water, free electricity have cushioned millions of Ghanaians, while business have been given solace through various interventions such as (CAPBUSS) administered by the NBSSI.      Ghana today has one of the best Covid-19 responses in the world. The United Nations Lancet Covid-19 Commission, headed by the respected Development Economist Jeffery Sachs, in their September 2020 report, indicated that Ghana’s response to the Covid-19 crisis, has been quite “exceptional” and that the small West African Country’s name is boldly written in Gold among nations that have used their meager resources to achieve excellence in preventing spread of Covid-19 (Daily mail).      CORRUPTION      President Akufo Addo has demonstrated a strong desire to fight corruption compared to the inertia in the fight against corruption that characterized the leadership of President Mahama. Our NDC friends like to throw up corruption accusation against President Akufo Addo. Even PDS, which the President cancelled despite the opposition of America, is used by the NDC. Even Agyapa, which at this stage remains on paper, and which terms and processes the President has asked to be reviewed, is also used against him.      Despite whatever misgivings the NDC has, the record shows you cannot accuse President Akufo Addo of engaging himself personally in corruption. There can however be no debate. President Mahama between 2009 and 2016 engaged in conduct which clearly indicted himself and the high office of President into direct personal corruption.      The ford vehicle saga, where a beneficiary of projects and contracts from President Mahama was engaged in kickbacks to President Mahama, comes to mind. Even more shocking is the recent Airbus saga, where the aircraft manufacturing admitted to paying brides to President Mahama’s brother to influence the award of contracts to the company.      By contrast, you cannot touch President Akufo Addo as being involved directly or personally in such blatant corruption. There’s no gain saying that the national fight against corruption is safer in the hands of President Akufo Addo.      SADA      Even the way President Mahama treated his own people from the north is treacherous to them and appalling to the rest of the country. He touted himself in 2012 as the candidate from the north.

BRADFORD, Pa. - Fredric A. Lunden, 99, of Birch St., Bradford, passed away Monday (Nov. 30, 2020) at his residence, in the company of his son and daughter-in-law.      Born Aug. 20, 1921, in Port Allegany, he was a son of the late Arthur W. and Mona Meeker Lunden. On March 25, 1950, in Mt. Jewett, he married I. Ilene Himes Lunden, who preceded him in death March 27, 1992.      He graduated from Mt. Jewett High School in 1939, and attended Westbrooke Commercial Academy of Olean, N.Y., where he received certification from the International Accountants Society.      On July 23, 1942, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served with the Army Air Corp. While in the service he attended University of Arkansas and studied engineering. He served in Rhineland, Ardennes and Central Europe. He fought at the Battle of the Bulge with the 99th Infantry, Company E 393rd Regiment. He was awarded the American Campaign Medal, European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three Bronze Stars. He was honorably discharged on Jan. 11, 1946.      After the service he was employed at Bovaird & Seyfang in Bradford and then Dresser Manufacturing.

He was a member of First United Methodist Church, American Legion and 99th Infantry Association. In retirement Fred joined the Cattaraugus County Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, where he enjoyed dancing and performing at local area nursing homes. He also square danced at the Crook Farm in Bradford, the Olean Moose and local senior centers.      Fred loved to travel to DeLeon Springs, Fla., for the winters. He was an avid reader and enjoyed trips to the library. He was a collector of glassware and paperweights, which he picked up at garage sales or flea markets.

At this price, it is now the most affordable sub-compact SUV in the market. Looking to take on some very capable rivals like Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue and Maruti Vitara Brezza, Magnite has clearly sought to play the affordability card while assuring a premium drive and ride experience.Offered in a 1.0-litre petrol and a 1.0-turbo petrol engine option, Magnite also plugs in an X-TRONIC CVT transmission option, has a spacious cabin and an optional Tech Pack at an additional cost which packs in ambient lights, premium speakers, air purifier, wireless phone charging, and more.While the starting price for the base model is for a Magnite that will be with the 1.0-litre, five-speed manual variant, it could still give Nissan quite a leg up against its more established rivals in the car market.How then does the Magnite's price look when put up against the petrol versions of Sonet, Venue, Brezza and others?It is the XE variant of Magnite that sits under the ₹5 lakh-mark. The introductory prices of all variants of this car are valid till December 31. From the new year, prices will be revised and the base will start from ₹5.54 lakh.

Shanahan said players could fly families down during this stretch to stay near the team although he suggested waiting a week to get situated first. He’s hopeful his family can come and possibly even see a game in person because Arizona allows families at games while the 49ers had no spectators at Levi’s Stadium.
 The Niners have experience spending one week on the road, having done it between games back East the past two seasons. They won the second game on both of those trips.
 This version won’t have any of the usual bonding time for players as COVID-19 protocols limit how much time players can have contact with each other. Shanahan said a 30-minute meal after a win at New Orleans last month led to positive tests.
 But with the Niners (5-6) only one game out of a playoff spot, the team has plenty of reason to rally together and make a late-season push.
 “When there’s more rewards and you’re seeing that you are in the fight, human nature is a lot more excited,” Shanahan said. “It’s easier to go through the grind when you have a chance to get into the tournament at the end.”
 The Niners will be getting some reinforcements back with receiver Brandon Aiyuk and defensive linemen D.J. Jones expected to be activated this week from the COVID-19 list and return to practice.
 Shanahan said quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (ankle) and All-Pro tight end George Kittle (foot) could get back on the field for individual workouts soon but aren’t ready for practice. He held out hope the two could return for the final two games of the season.

There were a lot of unknowns surrounding Oxford’s linebackers entering this season. What has become known over the past three months is that it’s one of the best linebacker groups in the state.


  Led by senior Tristan Shorter, junior Keegan Wilfawn and sophomore Alex Sanford, the unit has been a nightmare for opposing offenses. Their play is a big reason why the Chargers (12-0) could win a second-straight Class 6A state championship when they face Oak Grove (12-0) on Friday night in Jackson.


  Shorter was the lone returning starter at linebacker this fall. In fact, he was the lone returning starter on the entire defense.


  “But we did think we had the potential to be good at that position,” coach Chris Cutcliffe said.


  He especially liked the potential of the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Sanford. Playing in the middle of Oxford’s 3-3 stack scheme, he leads the team in both tackles (109) and tackles-for-loss (19).


  In last week’s 31-27 win over Clinton, Sanford scooped up a fumble and returned it 13 yards for a touchdown.


  “He has all the tools that you need,” Cutcliffe said. “But more than that I think it’s his maturity level and his work ethic and his desire to be great.”


  Sanford said he didn’t expect much out of himself this season, “but I just expected to be the best me on the field.” He already has an offer from Ole Miss.


  Wilfawn (5-11, 210) is the son of Oxford’s strength and conditioning coach, Jason Wilfawn. He’s recorded 97 tackles, 13 tackles-for-loss and three fumble recoveries this season.


  Wilfawn saw some playing time last year and drew a start against Tupelo.


  “Keegan is a worker,” Cutcliffe said. “He gets after it all the time.”


  Shorter is a third-year starter. His outside linebacker spot is a hybrid position, which means he helps a lot in pass coverage.


  The 6-foot, 185-pounder has made six interceptions, returning four of them for touchdowns. He had a pick-six against Clinton.


  Shorter also has 65 tackles, 10 tackles-for-loss and three fumble recoveries.


  Shorter, Wilfawn and Sanford complement each other with their varying strengths. Plus they get good contributions from fellow linebackers Christian “Q” Blake, Demonte Mitchell and Spencer Morgan.


  “Me and Q Blake, we can play on the run, we can get in the backfield, and we can also drop back in coverage,” Shorter said. “One thing about Keegan and Alex is they’re good at reading through the (gaps) and spying on the quarterback, and they play fast side to side.”


  Cutcliffe said Jason Wilfawn and defensive coordinator Stan Robertson deserve the bulk of the credit for how the linebackers and the defense as a whole have coalesced this season.


  Oxford has forced 33 turnovers – 16 interceptions and 17 fumbles – and the defense has accounted for eight touchdowns.


  “We’re covering from sideline to sideline and being where we need to be, where the ball is,” Keegan Wilfawn said, “all the time.”

“This year to ensure the safety of not only our clients but also our staff and the other employees in the building, we are providing a majority of the health insurance counseling to older adults and their caregivers over the phone, through the mail, via email.”
 The agency has provided in-person assistance to individuals that needed a little bit more assistance.
 “They may just had a harder time over the phone and through the email or again through the postal mail,” Leerkes said.
 “So, we have made face-to-face visits following all the safety COVID protocols.”
 CHANGING TIMES
 Directly or indirectly, the Essex County Office for the Aging, serves hundreds and hundred of individuals.
 “These individuals could be the clients themselves, caregivers or professionals that are reaching out for those that they are serving as well,” she said.
 "Regardless of everything that everybody is dealing with whether it's this year, last year or next year; we are strongly encouraging all Medicare beneficiaries to always review their coverage for the following year during Open Enrollment, which is Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.”
 During the open enrollment period, people with Medicare can change their health plans and prescription drug coverage for the following year to better meet their needs. Plan changes take effect January 1, 2021.
 “People’s health and financial status can change over the course of a year—particularly this year, due to COVID-19,” Greg Olsen, NYSOFA acting director, said.
 “Plans also can change what they will cover as well as adjust the cost to the beneficiary. It’s important for older adults to review their current plans before the end of the open enrollment period to ensure they are getting a plan that is a good value and meets their health care and prescription drug coverage needs. Health Insurance Information, Counseling and Assistance Program (HIICAP) counselors at each local office for the aging can provide older New Yorkers with the information needed to make an informed choice about a plan that is best for them.”
 “This is a time that we want Medicare beneficiaries to look at that coverage because we know that health plans change whether it's the premiums, whether it's the deductibles, the co-pay structure, in network versus out-of-network providers,” Leerkes said.
 “There are a whole wide variety of various things that could change with individuals' health insurance that we don't want them to go unnoticed.”
 POLICY CHANGES
 Per the release, staying healthy is more critical than ever, particularly for older adults, who remain at greater risk for COVID-19 and other illnesses, such as the flu.
 Older individuals who have had Medicare Part B (medical insurance) for longer than 12 months are eligible for a yearly wellness visit at low or no cost to develop or update a personalized plan based on their current health and risk factors.
 “We want all these individuals to research their plans, so that way when the next year comes around that they don't have any surprises,” Leerkes said.
 “That they can ensure that their medications are covered, their doctors are in network, that their premium has not increased drastically that they maybe cannot potentially be able to afford it."
 RESEARCH IS KEY
 Seniors should treat their Medicare number as they do their social security number and credit card information and never give their personal information to anyone arriving at their home uninvited or making unsolicited phone calls selling Medicare-related products or services.
 “So we always encourage everybody to do this research during Open Enrollment,” Leerkes said.

The big question about a COVID-19 vaccine has shifted from efficacy to whether enough Americans will agree to receive it. Skepticism of inoculations is frustratingly widespread, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that they work. Shots are unpleasant and sometimes come with side effects. The anti- vaxxer movement has attacked vaccines for mistakenly believing they may cause autism. In the Black community, suspicions run deep because of the legacy of past abuses by the medical system.
 Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the Chicago-based American Medical Association, tells us she trusts the career scientists in charge of the regulatory process to approve a safe COVID-19 drug. Yet she worries: "I think our biggest concern is that we have a great vaccine and people don't take it."
 A Pew Research Center survey in September of about 10,000 adults found that just 21% of U.S. adults would definitely get a COVID-19 vaccine, and 24% said they definitely would not. The rest were somewhere in the middle, leaning for or against. This is troubling news. If the vaccine becomes an optional response to the pandemic, the virus will continue to spread and cause harm to families and the economy. The country can't get back to work fully until the outbreak is contained, and the vaccine is the way to get there.
 "We have to have a significant number of people take it to get to herd immunity," Bailey warns.
 The Pew survey asked a theoretical question about a vaccine. We now have some confirmed details and early results from clinical trials of three different vaccines. Those results are promising. Versions from two U.S. drugmakers Pfizer (with German partner BioNTech) and Moderna are about 95% effective, the companies report. Both vaccines rely on revolutionary technology that uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, to create protection at the molecular level by injecting a piece of genetic code that primes the body's defenses. Bailey says this would be the first mRNA vaccine to get broad use.
 A third vaccine, developed by Europe's AstraZeneca and Oxford University, relies on a more traditional method of using a modified inactive cold virus to trigger an immune response. AstraZeneca says its vaccine is about 70% effective, but there is some confusion about the data. When researchers injected test subjects with a half dosage the effectiveness jumped to 90%. AstraZeneca's vaccine would be less expensive and easier to distribute than the other two because it doesn't have to be kept in a deep freeze. The company's CEO says the company is likely to conduct another global vaccine trial.
 There are still plenty of questions about what the national vaccination project will look like, the timing of distribution and who might get which version of the two-injection regimen. The vaccine is expected to be administered without charge because the federal government is paying. Washington is coordinating with the states on the rollout, which should begin before the end of the year. It will take months until most Americans are inoculated. Will it be a one-time shot, or every five years? Not yet know. Side effects? Maybe some temporary flu-like discomfort for some people.
 Those are details. The crucial step will be to break through vaccine anxiety, and the best way to do that is for vaccine developers, regulators and experts to share as much information as possible about the COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness, and about any shortcomings. Its fast development makes some people uneasy. The power of the anti-vaxx movement, based on bogus science, hurts credibility. Members of the Black community harbor distrust that dates at least to the infamous Tuskegee experiment, when Black men in Alabama were left untreated for syphilis as part of a study. Those concerns need to be addressed by the medical establishment and by doctors and nurses speaking frankly to individual patients.
 Need reassurance that vaccines work? Diseases like polio and smallpox were eradicated in the United States by vaccines. Measles disappeared 20 years ago, but it's made a small comeback — because some parents stopped vaccinating their children.
 Need a further dose of confidence? Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading authority on infectious diseases, tells USA Today that once the vaccine gets FDA approval, he'll take it and recommend that his family does too. He says COVID-19 can be defeated, and life can begin to return to normal. But only when the overwhelming majority of people are protected by the vaccine and herd immunity kicks in.
 "It's kind of dependent upon us," Fauci says.
 He's right. Prevention is always better than treatment.

In 2019 there were 2.9 million lone parent families accounting for nearly 15% of families. 3 million children live in single parent families. Most single parents (86%) are women. Even prior to the pandemic 47% of children in single parent families lived in relative poverty compared to 24% in coupled families - with less than half of single parents receiving the child maintenance payments they are entitled to.

“Assassin’s Creed Valhalla” represents a return to form for a franchise that has struggled to find its identity in recent iterations.
 Released on just about every platform under the sun — the Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC and Google Stadia — “Valhalla” was pushed out in time for the next-generation console launch with a few bugs along the way. And while it might not take advantage of the new hardware capabilities beyond a rock-solid framerate and prettier graphics, it still feels like a breath of fresh air for a series that has meandered ever since it tried to reinvent itself three years ago.
 Eivor serves as the new protagonist, this time in the nordic regions of Europe. The character can be played as either a male or female. For my playthrough purposes, I played as a female Eivor, so that’s how I will refer to the character from this point forward. After avenging the murder of her father at the hands of a man who would go on to be a part of the Templar order, Eivor casts her fortunes in with her foster-brother, who travels to England as part of the wave of danes and other invaders.
 For once, a character isn’t driven by revenge or some fraught path of anger and destruction. Eivor simply wants to live a better life and make a home for herself and her clan. It’s certainly a relief to enjoy a story that gets away from the revenge plots that have driven so many of the “Assassin’s Creed” games as of late. It’s that shift in story and perspective that drives one of the main components of the game — the settlement.
 Taking a page from “Assassin’s Creed III,” one of Eivor’s main tasks throughout the game is building a settlement for her people. As the game progresses, and she obtains more resources, she can build buildings for new services, to attract more residents and to expand influence and power across the region. These expansions require resources, which lead to the game’s next big addition — raids.
 Eivor is a viking and vikings viking. She gains resources by raiding monasteries and other communities across the lands of England. This mechanic could get very controversial quickly, as vikings often slaughtered many when raiding. Thankfully, Eivor and her clan only kill soldiers who stand in their way. Monks or civilians are to be unharmed, and killing one can lead to desynchronization — the game’s version of death.
 “Valhalla” is a much tighter and more refined game compared to its predecessor, “Odyssey.” The latter game was overstuffed with content — much of which was passible, at best — that soaked up hundreds of hours. It just wasn’t fun after a paint, and actually felt like more of a chore than a game. So this game toned stuff down, a bit. Missions are straight forward enough and there is plenty of room for exploration and activities. Rather than being waved down by every passing stranger with some generic fetch quest for Eivor, “Valhalla” includes world events that are carefully crafted and offer a bit of a mystery, some nice character development, or interesting gameplay in order to justify their existence.
 Ubisoft sort of went back to the basics and combined a lot of what worked in the older “Assassin’s Creed” titles with what worked in the newer versions post-”Origins.” After the poor reception ot “Unity” in 2013, the publisher went back to the drawing board for the franchise, drawing inspirations from “The Witcher III” to craft a more RPG-oriented experience, as opposed to the stealth-action hybrid of the previous games. A lot of the stealth elements were abandoned and assassinations were cast aside — ironically, for a series named “Assassin’s Creed.” “Valhalla” brings those stealth elements, especially the social stealth, back to the forefront. Eivor might not be a refined assassin like Ezio, but she can easily blend in to a crowd to make her way to a target. She can blend in with individuals, hide on benches and dive into hiding spots in order to set up the perfect attack. It finally feels like Ubisoft found a good balance.
 The biggest complication with “Valhalla” remains the modern day story. It’s just so overly complicated and convoluted, to the point where it’s hard to keep track of what’s going on without diving into a wiki, or spending literal hours pouring over material from spinoff games, comic books and novels. I’ve always been a fan of the modern day storyline, with its emphasis on ancient civilizations, gods and how elements throughout history have been affected by the search for powerful artifacts. But it’s beginning to cripple under the weight of its own ambition, and it’s time to end iijt. There’s only so many apocalypses the world can face.
 Thankfully, much of the modern day story can be possibly ignored for a greater focus on Eivor. There are still some frustrating RPG elements and an inventory and loot system that’s better left abandoned than embraced. But “Assassin’s Creed Valhalla” still feels like a great return to form for stealth-action fans, and a good starting point for the next iteration of the series.

Based on 28 years of research, including hundreds of interviews with Malcolm's friends, family acquaintances, allies and enemies, _The Dead Are Arising_ reflects the elder Payne's dedication to tirelessly teasing out the truth behind what he described as the much-mythologized figure's journey "from street criminal to devoted moralist and revolutionary."

But hidden in plain sight in Seattle's lackluster 23-17 victory that was notable mostly for how non-decisive it was, there was once again the glimmer of something approaching ... normalcy in the Seahawks' defense. And for a team that until two weeks was setting a pace for the most yards allowed in NFL history, normalcy is good. In fact, it's just delightful.
 Even better, if you're looking down the road to a playoff appearance that now seems a foregone conclusion, is that there were times Monday you could even substitute "dominance" for normalcy. Or "feistiness." Or, certainly, "burgeoning confidence," as amplified by someone who oozes that trait, safety Jamal Adams.
 "The swagger's through the roof man," Adams said. "We're playing with a lot of swag, we're playing with a lot of confidence. We know when we step on the field, we're going to try to take the ball away, we're going to get a sack, and we're going to get a pick. And then we're going to invite everybody to the party, man. That's what we do."
 For the first 8 1/2 games, it more closely resembled a pity party than anything else. The Seahawks defense was portrayed as the weak link that could very well sabotage their title hopes, and for good reason. Teams were running rampant on them, and they seemed helpless to stem the tide.
 But things started to change in the second half of the Rams game, when they held L.A. scoreless after another miserable start in the first half. Then came the well-documented accountability meeting by the defense that led to a stellar performance against Arizona in which they held the No. 1 ranked offense in the league to 100 yards below their average.
 That resurgence continued Monday, when Seattle limited Philadelphia to just 250 yards and a deceptive 17 points — it was just nine until that Hail Mary connected for a meaningless score with 12 seconds left in the game.
 And yes, I threw out those earlier provisos for a reason. Philadelphia's offense is stuck in the sort of malaise that gets quarterbacks benched, coaches fired and sports radio hosts on WIP frothing at the mouth.
 But for much of the year, favorable matchups and ostensibly weak opponents didn't stop the Seahawks defense from getting gashed, bashed and otherwise trashed.
 So take the signs of continuing progress Monday with a grain of salt, yes, but also with a realization that genuine change is occurring before our very eyes.
 It certainly helps that the Seahawks are slowly returning to health, with cornerback Shaquill Griffin the latest starter to come off the injured list. The cohesion and consistency is growing as key players finally get a chance to play with one another for more than a week at a time.
 "There were a lot of corrections, other things fixed during the game, a lot of great communication," coach Pete Carroll said. "We've taken a real nice step forward, and I'm hoping that we can just keep building on it."
 The midseason addition of defensive end Carlos Dunlap from Cincinnati has undoubtedly been the most dramatic turning point for the defense; the Seahawks will sweat out the foot injury that knocked him out of the game late in the fourth quarter.
 Before Dunlap arrived, the Seahawks had 12 sacks in seven games. After adding six more Monday — with seven players contributing full or half sacks — they have 19 sacks in the four games since Dunlap joined the Seahawks. That's a stunning turnaround for a team who's pass rush was rightfully deemed one of Seattle's glaring weaknesses.
 "Kenny's doing a really nice job of mixing the calls and utilizing the personnel and keeping them off balance, and it's great that everybody's benefiting," Carroll said, referencing much-maligned defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr.
 The upshot is that as the Seahawks lurch past the first of four consecutive games against subpar opponents, their defense will have a great chance to further solidify before the team reaches the meat of its schedule.
 We've all seen enough defensive breakdowns this year to know it could all still fall apart against a well-oiled offense run by an elite quarterback — neither of which were within the county line Monday night. But considering the dire results of the first two months, it's rather amazing to be analyzing a defensive revival that looked like it would never come.
 "You know, we're coming together, man," Adams said. "Everybody's getting healthy, we're starting to understand the defense as a whole. We're playing together, we're playing as one. And like I said, from the beginning, we knew what we had. We knew what type of talent we had. It was only a matter of time.
 "We understood that people outside, they were going to chirp. But at the end of the day, we knew who we were as a team."
 Speaking on behalf of the outside chirpers, could it turn out that the Seahawks, to paraphrase the late Dennis Green, aren't who we thought they were?

The Court of Appeals of Iowa recently ruled that District Court Judge Thomas A. Bitter was unaware of his discretion to reduce a five-year mandatory minimum sentence if mitigating circumstances exist in Gilden’s conviction for willful injury, and because that discretion was not exercised, a resentencing is mandated, according to court documents filed Monday.
 At trial, Gilden had argued that he acted in self-defense after he was attacked. Bitter sentenced Gilden in January to a total of 10 years in prison for three charges related to the stabbing and revoked Gilden’s probation for four forgery convictions, imposing a five-year sentence for each.
 Gilden’s 10 years related to the attack were to be served at the same time as the 20 years for the forgery convictions.
 At Gilden’s sentencing hearing, Bitter noted the willful-injury charge amounted to a forcible felony and stated his belief that the imposition of a prison sentence was mandatory, according to documents.
 The appellate court ruled that Bitter’s discretion to reduce the mandatory minimum under Iowa law “went unmentioned” and was not cited in the sentencing order, according to documents.
 The appellate court vacated the sentence imposed for willful injury causing serious injury and remanded Gilden for resentencing.
 The appellate court ruled that the district “court may leave the sentences imposed as to the other convictions intact, or, if the court determines the entire sentencing scheme should be revisited, the court may resentence on all counts.”

This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate. The module will also teach students to nuance standard maritime historiographies through literary reading practices, as well as evaluate the metaphoric application of piracy to contemporary, interruptive, economic practices.

Roy A. Johnson      Roy A. Johnson, 81, of Taunton, MA, passed away peacefully and gently on November 17, 2020, with his loving wife, Ginny, by his side. He was the beloved husband of Virginia L. (Nolin) Johnson, whom he married on January 28, 2006 on a quiet beach on the island of Oahu, HI. He was also the husband of the late Cynthia G. (Royer) Johnson who passed away in May 2005.   Born on January 26, 1939 in Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, MA, he was the son of the late Raymond W. Johnson and the late Ruth (Mohr) Johnson.   Most of his life was lived in Attleboro and he attended Attleboro schools before entering the United States Navy early in 1956 where he served as a Machinist Mate on board of the USS Albany and then was among the men who commissioned the USS Ranger Air Craft Carrier. He happily sailed the mighty seas crossing the equator and sailed around Cape Horn. He received an honorable discharge in December 1959.   After his military discharge, he worked and was trained in the heating industry by his brother-in-law, Ralph J. Baumgartel, with whom Roy worked for several years. He worked for Dwyer Heating in Attleboro before starting his own business, Roy's Heating & Air Conditioning which he ran in the greater Attleboro area for over 25 years. He was admired by his customers and they were very loyal to him. They appreciated his over 50 years of experience and especially his honesty. He worked until he was 75 years old.   Roy had a wonderful sense of humor that everyone loved. He and Ginny loved traveling and made three trips to Europe, Alaska, twice to Hawaii and Disney World, Niagara Falls, and many senior trips. He enjoyed word search puzzles, computer games, cooking, animals, playing cards with the "old guys" on Tuesday afternoons, and just being home with his wife.   Roy was the father of Susan E. (Johnson) Whalen and son-in-law, Scott, of Beaumont, Texas; Ruth Ann (Johnson) Howe and son-in-law, Barry, of Rhode Island; and Deanna R (Johnson) O'Clair and son-in-law, John, of Attleboro. He was the stepfather of Kathleen M. (Cotter) Bentley of Warwick, RI; John D. Cotter of Tolland, MA; Joseph P. Cotter of Agawam, MA; Lisa L. (Cotter) Bouvier of Attleboro; Bridgette M. (Cotter) Cobb of North Attleboro, MA; and Timothy P. Cotter of Vermillion, South Dakota. He also had 8 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews.   He was the dear brother of Amy (Johnson) Long of Attleboro, MA and the brother-in-law of Flora (Hoyt) Johnson of South Attleboro, MA. Roy was predeceased by his siblings: the late Louise (Johnson) Baumgartel, Barbara (Johnson) Watson, Florence (Johnson) Paille, Dorothy (Johnson) Radnor, and Raymond Johnson Jr., and many friends.   Visitation and a Memorial Service Celebrating Roy's life will be held in the Spring of 2021 once it is safer to congregate.   A Graveside Service with Military Honors will follow at the Massachusetts National Cemetery, Bourne, MA at a later date.   As an expression of sympathy and in lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Roy may be made to either HopeHealth Hospice, 1085 North Main Street, Providence, RI 02904 or to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, TN 38105.

“Nearly all counties are in the red zone with extensive and unyielding spread; hospitalizations are increasing week over week; mitigation and messaging needs to be further strengthened as other states have done," the recommendations said. “Effective practices to decrease transmission in public spaces include requiring masks, limiting restaurant indoor capacity to less than 25%, and closing bars until cases and test positivity decrease to the yellow zone. Strong mitigation efforts by neighboring states are showing early impact.”
 While eight cities implemented mask mandates in recent weeks, efforts in the region to present have not taken off. The Scottsbluff City Council denied two measures related to the pandemic, the first being forming a board of health, a step needed to require masks, and the other, adopting a resolution in partnership with PPHD, encouraging mask use, hand hygiene, flu shots and other measures to keep hospital capacity down and slow the spread.

The further irony of this matter is that today, President Mahama in 2020, has asked the current government to account for the loans taken. He was not referred to Parliament. Dr. Bawumia politely provided to him and the Ghanaian people a comprehensive list of projects on which the loans had been applied. This is a contrast that is crucial in determining the next leader of Ghana, for which the Ghanaian people must take due notice.      CONTRAST WITH PRESIDENT AKUFO ADDO      The contrast with President Akufo Addo does not end here. President Akufo Addo has demonstrated leadership that is clear departure from the leadership of convenience, leadership of expediency, obey the wind, leadership of lack of principle, offered by President Mahama.      President Akufo Addo presents a stable, firm, steadfast, principled and consistent leadership. He has kept his promises. You may differ on your estimate of his success. But what is always clear is that he has provided a stable and firm leadership to the Ghanaian people and remained focused on delivering his promises.      Free SHS, creation of new Regions, One District One Factory, One Village One Dam, have all been long standing national aspirations. They have remained aspirations, turned into great promises by Candidate Akufo Addo. Upon his election, he had brought a determined and focused leadership, to lead the nation to achieve these aspirations, with great degrees of success. Not surprising President Akufo Addo has been given the title “Promise Keeper”, by one of our prominent chiefs.      DAGBON PEACE      The intractable Dagbon chieftaincy dispute had been a sore point for this nation since the murder of the Yana in 2002.      Candidate Akufo Addo promised he will lead the people of Dagbon to peace.      In 2010, President Akufo Addo finally brought peace to Dagbon culminating in the installation of a new Yana and opening up a new period of peace and hope for our brothers and sisters in Dagbon. A singular feat for which he earned the title Naa Abudani I.      OBUASI GOLDFIELDS      This world famous Ashanti Goldfields at Obuasi, under President Mahama’s watch was closed down and left to rot. President Akufo Addo, in the 2016 campaign, promised the people of Ghana he would ensure that famous mine opened. True to his word, today, the mine is opened and fully operational employing thousands of Ghanaians, a feat which almost brought the Asantehene to tears during the commissioning.      INDUSTRIALIZATION      This country, like all 3rd world countries, has long held on to the hope of industrialization, as a sure way to climb out of poverty and build a country of prosperity and jobs for the youth.      After the exit of President Nkrumah in 1966, this fond hope of industrialization has been left largely unattended. Candidate Akufo Addo promised he would make a determined effort to take this country into an industrial state.      President Akufo Addo, under the 1D1F programme, has set to achieve for the Ghanaian people, this industrial state. In the next four years when majority of these factories are up and running, the goal of an industrial economy will be within reach of our country.      By contrast, President Mahama’s effort at industrialization is typified by what happened with the infamous Komenda Sugar Factory!      RAILWAYS

The holiday season is upon us and like many things in 2020, it will look significantly different than in years past. Gone are the days of large family gatherings around the Thanksgiving dinner table and hours spent shopping for the perfect gift. This year, with social distancing and stay-at-home orders in place, the holiday season will consist of scaled back events, month-long Black Friday sales and at-home activities with your immediate loved ones.


  Across industries, businesses are also feeling the ripple effects of 2020’s challenging holiday season. In retail, for example, online transactions are expected to spike due to restricted in-person shopping. Meanwhile, the travel industry is implementing new measures to adhere to COVID-19 safety regulations amidst the busiest travel time of the year. With large in-person gatherings off the table and travel limitations in place, a brand new kind of holiday season is taking shape, and may remain in place even after the curve is flattened.


  Despite a year of uncertainty, the sentiment of the holiday season has not changed. Instead, people are looking for new ways to show their loved ones that they care. In business, it’s no different. Now more than ever, brands must adapt their customer experience strategy to show customers gratitude and let them know that business will remain constant, even when everything else is in flux. In the spirit of the holiday season, here are three customer experience strategies for showing your customers you care:


  ## 1\. Build Much-Needed Simplicity Into the Holiday Season


  For many, the holiday season is the most hectic time of year. There are Zoom parties to attend, errands to run and deadlines to meet before signing off for vacation. In addition to the usual hustle and bustle, consumers now face pandemic stress, too. With businesses limiting in-person capacity or shifting to primarily digital operations, easy tasks like booking a hotel room or running to the bookstore now feel more difficult.

NEW YORK (AP) — Rockin' around the Christmas tree is going to look different for visitors at Rockefeller Center this year, starting with Wednesday's tree lighting ceremony. What's normally a chaotic, crowded tourist hotspot during the holiday season will instead be a mask-mandated, time- limited, socially distanced locale due to the coronavirus pandemic. The tree, a 75-foot (23-meter) Norway spruce, is getting its holiday lights turned on in an event that will be broadcast on television but closed to the public. Among those scheduled for performances are Kelly Clarkson, Dolly Parton, and Earth, Wind & Fire. In the days following the lighting until the early part of January, those wishing to take a look at the tree will have to follow a host of rules. The plaza where the tree is physically located will be closed to the public; instead, there will be specific tree-viewing zones on the midtown Manhattan blocks on either side. Visitors will join a virtual line, and can get text messages to let them know when it's their turn. At that point, they will be directed to specific pods, each of which can hold four people, to look at the tree. There will be a five-minute limit to tree-viewing. Of course, everyone will have to be wearing masks and maintain social distance. Entrance to the skating rink and retail will be separate. The restricted approach is a necessary one, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier this week. “It will be limited, the number of people that can get close. This is what we got to do to protect everyone.\" Workers at Rockefeller Center first put up a tree in 1931. It became an annual tradition starting in 1933. This year's tree came from Oneonta, in central New York.

“You’ll see it’s dominated by indicator bacteria — e. Coli — biological and fish kills,” said DNR water monitor Ken Krier, during a press conference Tuesday.
 That rings true in Clayton, Delaware, Dubuque, Jackson and Jones counties, too.
 The area’s map of impaired waters looks largely identical to that of 2018. Most of the Turkey River in Clayton County, the entire Maquoketa River in Delaware, Jones and Jackson counties, and the Catfish Creek system in Dubuque County all are impaired in Category 5 for e. Coli levels.
 Another stretch of Catfish Creek — from its mouth at the Mississippi River to its confluence with the separate South Fork Catfish Creek — has a second impairment as well, stemming from a fish kill in 2014, due to “unknown toxicity.”
 “There’ll be a report of a fish kill, but perhaps there was a considerable lag between the report and the investigation,” Krier explained. “And, they were unable, by water samples or anecdotal data, to determine what caused it.”
 Category 5 means a total “maximum daily load plan” must be created and implemented to correct the impairment.
 It does not, though, mean the segment of water is necessarily unsafe for recreation.
 “The impairment of a use does not mean the segment covered by that use is unusable,” said DNR water monitoring Supervisor Roger Bruner. “It doesn’t prevent the use of that segment for recreational use. By and large, waters in the state of Iowa are safe to be in, use, fish in and eat that fish. There is a perception that once a segment is impaired, it is not safe. That is not the case.”
 Krier said each of these reports tends to read negatively.
 “Based on our methodology, the impaired waters list is always going to have a negative bias,” he said. “If water is ever construed as impaired or potentially impaired, unless new water quality data, biological data is collected, that stays impaired.”
 And, not every segment of surface water in the state is assessed each cycle. Between 2018 and 2020, 1,300 segments were assessed, down from 1,421 in the two-year period prior.
 Iowa Rep. Chuck Isenhart, D-Dubuque, who sits on the House Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees, asked about a Dubuque County segment, in particular.
 “Dubuque County just opened Lytle Creek for recreational use,” he wrote in the conference’s Zoom chat. “How and when will that stream be assessed?”
 It turned out that the DNR had assessed Lytle Creek this cycle. It was not classified as being impaired, but the agency noted that not enough data existed to say if recreation was its principle use.
 What the report does do is give the DNR something to shoot for, in terms of addressing water quality needs. And, as Bruner said, there are some success stories in the report, including in Dubuque County.
 A stretch of Hickory Creek northeast of Dyersville had been impaired to a Category 5 level, due to fish kills caused by animal waste runoff from a nearby farm. This year, the DNR removed it from the list of impaired waterways.
 “We did have some, where new data — be it water quality, biological or fish kill — made it possible to delist,” Krier said.
 The overall decrease in impaired segments of surface water this cycle was largely due to some big maximum daily load plans and assessments of big stretches of big systems being conducted, especially on the Iowa River. The decrease by no means illustrates an all clear for Iowa water.
 “I would call it stable,” Krier said. “Last cycle, from 2016 to 2018, there was a 2% increase. Since, there was a 2% decrease.”
 The draft report is open for public comment from now until year’s end.

HUNTINGTON — Marshall quarterback Grant Wells continued to ring in the holiday season with gifts from national awards on Tuesday.
 This time, Wells — a freshman from Charleston — was one of 35 players nationwide named to the Davey O’Brien Quarterback Class of 2020, as named by the Davey O’Brien Award, which goes to the top college quarterback in the nation.
 While Wells stays humbled and appreciates the award nominations he’s received this year, his focus remains on the field as he prepares Marshall for Saturday’s noon contest against Rice.
 Wells’ focus is centered on a Marshall team which returns to the field in control of its own destiny within Conference USA’s East Division.
 It is a position that Marshall was in last season and faltered with a late road loss at Charlotte.
 That isn’t a scenario Wells wants to see his team go through again.
 “I wasn’t necessarily starting, but I felt the same thing they did,” Wells said. “I was just as close as they were. It’s just trying to learn from last year and not try to get ahead of ourselves and thinking about what’s in two or three weeks — just focus on the game we’re getting ready to play.”
 For Wells, that involves going up against a Rice team that features plenty of talent, especially in the front seven.
 Linebacker Blaze Alldredge keys a group that also features a strong defensive front with an all-around smart, veteran defense that Wells knows will be a challenge this week.
 “When you talk about Rice, you know you’re always going to get an experienced defense,” Wells said. “You are always going to get guys where they are supposed to be.”
 With Marshall (7-0, 4-0 Conference USA) returning to the field for the first time since a Nov. 14 win over Middle Tennessee, Wells said the focus is taking all the little things worked on during the three-week break and translating them to the field.
 Wells said the team used its time to fine-tune all the fundamentals to be as crisp as possible upon their return to the field at noon on Saturday.
 “When you really have time off, you really start to focus on yourself as a team and focus on the basics that you might stray away from when you have multiple games in a row,” Wells said.

"Il Giro d’Italia 2020? L’obiettivo era vestire per qualche giorno la maglia rosa ed essere di sostegno a Thomas: sembrava tutto perfetto, poi tutto è andato a monte per l’infortunio a Geraint. Alla fine Tao Gheogegan Hart è riuscito a concludere benissimo tutto questo lavoro della Ineos". Così Filippo Ganna (nella foto), intervistato da Radio Sportiva, ha fatto il punto sulla stagione ciclistica. "Se riuscirò a vincere un Grande Giro? Al momento non ci penso – aggiunge il campione del mondo della cronometro –. Il piano è partecipare al Giro 2021 per arrivare pronto alla crono e alla prova del quartetto a Tokyo. Record dell’ora? Nel 2021 c’è tantissima carne al fuoco, finiti gli appuntamenti importanti arriverà anche quello".

Funeral service for Luella Vearn Scruggs will be 11a.m., Friday, Dec. 4, 2020, at Grant Chapel AME Church with Rev. Garland Hall, pastor officiating.
 Burial will follow in Fairlawn Cemetery, Snyder, under the direction of Becker-Rabon Funeral Home, Lawton.
 Luella Vearn Scruggs was born on June 23, 1948 to Edward Byron Johnson and Clara Sue Burris Johnson in Snyder. She departed this life on Nov. 27, 2020, peacefully at home at the age of 72. Luella was raised in the Church of God in Christ and her favorite song to sing was “Two Wings.” She attended Snyder Elementary until she was in the 8th grade, and then went on to Snyder High, where her favorite class was Home Economics. She graduated from Snyder High in 1967. Luella married Richard L. Jackson on May 26, 1967 and to this union a son was born, Richard Jerel Jackson. On Feb. 25, 1974 she married Prentice Lemar Scruggs Sr. To this union 3 children were born: Trenda, Prentice Lemar Jr and Porsha. Luella worked at the Lawton Police department, then she worked at the mess hall on Fort Sill and later went on working as a housekeeper for many years. Luella was a member of Grant Chapel AME Church for 40 years. The auxiliaries she served on were the Alneda Story Missionary Society, Stewardsee Board, the choir and the food ministry. Luella was loved by many. She spoke to everyone and never met a stranger. If you didn’t want to know the truth, then you shouldn’t have asked her. She would tell it like it is. Luella was truly one of a kind! Luella was an amazing cook. She really enjoyed her time in the kitchen and she would feed anyone who was hungry. Luella loved her family dearly, especially her grandchildren who she would always brag about. Luella will be truly missed and remembered for her comical personality, her love for Jesus, and her love for people.

Hueneke received the ball from Kalesia DeShaw on a perfectly executed press break, then scored inside the lane for the winning basket with 3.4 seconds remaining to lift the Comets in their season opener over Iowa Class 2A No. 13-ranked Cascade, 40-38, on Tuesday night at Bellevue High School.
 Hueneke — who finished with four points — broke free on the left side of the basket and went against the grain in making the winning shot.
 “I shot it with my right hand so I wouldn’t miss it,” she said with a laugh. “It does feel good.”
 Teresa Paulsen led a balanced attack from the Comets (1-0) with 11 points, as Kalesia DeShaw added nine points and Ka’Lynn DeShaw scored seven. The win marked Bellevue’s first over Cascade since Dec. 4, 2018, and just its fifth win over the Cougars (1-2) in their last 18 matchups.
 “We wanted to come out with a blank slate,” Paulsen said. “In years past, Cascade’s been up there at the top. We wanted to come out with a tough mindset and the confidence that we know we have.”
 In something almost no other team can say over the past decade, the Comets held off the rival Cougars despite committing 25 turnovers. However, it was Bellevue’s own fresh defensive approach that turned over the Cougars 19 times.
 “Our defense was key,” Bellevue coach Rick Reeg said. “It’s a new hybrid defense that we’ve been working on and it really stalled them in the first half. We told them that we have to create turnovers. We’re going to turn the ball over because we’re inexperienced, so take chances.”
 Paulsen scored a pair of buckets inside late in the second quarter that helped Bellevue to a 19-6 lead at halftime, holding Cascade to more turnovers (10) than points in the opening half with a defense always on the move.
 “It started the day after last season ended,” Reeg said. “I knew we’d be underrated and flying under the radar, so I was looking for something different. We weren’t going to survive with what we were doing in the past. We’re quicker and playing all out looking for steals. We worked on it through the summer and they really like it. They’re always moving.”
 As expected, Cascade made a run in the second half behind Alyssa Lux’s game- high 21 points. The sophomore guard sunk her second 3-pointer to pull the Cougars within 23-22, but Bellevue answered with Hueneke’s first bucket to make it 27-22 at the end of the frame.
 “They have good shooters and we knew it was coming,” Reeg said. “We were supposed to identify them at all times, and we lagged off and I couldn’t believe it. Lux had a really good game. Just a lack of experience. I challenged them and we got back at it with some key buckets.”
 Julia Penniston’s steal and layup pushed the Comets’ lead to 34-25 with 3:05 remaining, but the Cougars charged late with a 13-4 run to tie it. After consecutive triples by Lux, Hueneke was whistled for a travel in the press break that gave it right back to Cascade — and Lux hit another trey to tie the game at 38-38 with 13.1 seconds left.
 “They needed to get their confidence back a little and take care of the ball,” Cascade interim coach Ernie Bolibaugh said. “It’s a young team with not a lot of experienced kids yet. It’s going to come, but it’s going to be streaky and up-and-down right now. We’re just focusing on the good things, then the things we need to improve on from there.”
 The Comets answered with their biggest play in the clutch, breaking the press to perfection and setting up Hueneke’s heroics.
 “She was kind of down on herself, and a lot of the girls were,” Reeg said. “We’re better shooters than that. I told them to keep shooting it because they’re better shooters than that. But we got that big one at the end.”
 Cascade had a final chance, but Ally Hoffman mishandled the inbounds pass and the Comets jumped on it for a thrilling open to their season.
 “(Our resiliency) was huge,” Hueneke said. “We really wanted to win, so we just had to keep pushing and that really boosted our confidence. We played our best and left it out there.”

Those five players are probably more likely to win a game for City than Rodri, which might explain why they have been prioritised when it comes to rotation. Rodri, though, appears to be a player that is arguably more essential to Guardiola's approach this season, even if he does not get the same recognition as other players. He keeps this side ticking, whoever is alongside him in the starting XI.
 Rodri has the highest number of average passes among City midfielders by some distance, and trails only John Stones and Ruben Dias for the highest pass accuracy this season - with those two defenders seeing more of the ball without much pressure than Rodri does in midfield.
 It's telling that Rodri remained in the side ahead of Champions League specialist Ilkay Gundogan, who missed out on a starting spot for the first time in 18 European fixtures. With his fitness, quality, and consistency, Rodri is becoming undroppable for Guardiola whatever the game, whatever the competition, and whatever the pressure riding on the game.
