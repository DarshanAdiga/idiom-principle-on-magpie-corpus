ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 31st Mar, 2020 ) :Prime Minister's Focal Person Naseem ur Rehman Tuesday said concentrated efforts were being made to prevent the outbreak of Coronavirus at the 'Panah Gahs' of twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad which serve food to some 2,500 poor and gave overnight stay to 500 daily.


  "In a quick response to the Coronavirus threat, a comprehensive campaign has been launched in Rawalpindi and Islamabad to ensure hygienic environment at the shelter homes which have become an ultimate destination for the people affected by the virtual lockdown in the cities," the focal person told APP on Wednesday.


  Under the drive title 'Help Keep Panahgahs Clean', he said the shelter homes' management was mobilizing its resources in terms of human and kinds to make sure neat and tidy environment at those places in wake of the looming threat of COVID-19.


  Naseem said out-reach teams had been formed under the drive which held face to face interaction with the shelter homes beneficiaries who were more vulnerable to contract the virus due to their minimal exposure to print and electronic media.


  "The teams, comprising volunteers, have been giving practical demonstration to the visitors at Panahgahs about mask wearing, personal hygiene and use of soap and sanitizers," he added.

As outlined by Jay McBain, principal analyst at Forrester, the channel’s fortune’s for this year now heavily depend on measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 taken by the United States’ Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
 As it stands today, the global technology channel delivers U.S.$2.26 trillion to the economy, or 64 per cent of total customer spend.
 Even a minimum of a two per cent recession in the U.S. economy alone would see U.S.$47.36 billion wiped off the total U.S.$880.5 billion spend in technology through the channel. This, according to McBain, could lead to a marginal increase in bankruptcies and forced merger and acquisition activity in the channel as a result.
 Unfortunately, judging from the present situation, there is a 50 per cent probability that U.S. and global tech markets will decline by more than 2 per cent in 2020 if a full-fledged recession begins.
 According to McBain, this could affect more than a quarter of resellers, value-added resellers, independent software vendors and managed service providers (MSPs) around the world.
 “We have observed models where one-fourth of all technology partners either lose money or struggle to break even (in good economic times),” he said. “These partners are the most exposed in this scenario and are least likely to get additional capital or other lifelines.”

Many are going to see the directions above as either over the top or obsessive. Unfortunately, keeping a clean space and avoiding contamination is exactly that. It requires focus because it is so easy to cross-contaminate. At one point in my life journey, I had a medication that was delivered under the skin with a pump. I followed an equally long list in preparing to refill the pump and set the subcutaneous patch. It was a written list and I used the buddy system with both of us checking each step. If one of us dropped something off the clean area, or unconsciously scratched our nose, then we’d call a halt and change gloves.

"Again, it would be the last step for the ICC to push the T20 World Cup from 2020 to 2022 because there is no window in 2021. So, at the moment, it is all a bit too far-fetched to be honest.

The analyst cites the fact that Microsoft gained 12 million users for Teams, Slack picked up 7,000 new customers, Cisco Webex logged 5.5 billion meeting minutes during first the 11 days of March, a total of 3.2 million meetings per day. In addition, Zoom added more users in the first three months of this year than all of 2019.
 Once the world economy enters its inevitable – albeit eventual – recovery, partners will be able to capitalise on areas to help “customers survive and, later, thrive from this crisis”. These include, but are not limited to, moving customers to cloud infrastructure faster, automating customer workflows and engaging deeper in business consulting.
 In the short-term though, all vendors and partners will suffer short-term revenue losses. Aside from “a burst in triage activities” in collaboration and UCaaS tools, many core IT services businesses will be impacted as on-premises work grinds to a halt, argued McBain.
 The uncertainty of this climate can, in some cases, spark higher claims on partner programs from cash-starved partners, according to McBain.
