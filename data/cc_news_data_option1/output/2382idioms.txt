Napa Valley's Living Landscape: Take a hike

Most people realize that they need to provide shade and water for their pets, Whitehill said, but then they get out and about and running errands and decide to make what is intended to be a quick stop.


  “People do not think about taking their pet in their car, doing a drive around, perhaps stopping at the bank. An 85 degree day can quickly go to 102 degrees and up in a vehicle within 10 minutes, even in the shade with partially open windows,” she added. “With heatstroke, pets can become ill and die. For your pets, assume that you would use the same guideline you would use for leaving an infant in the car.”

Central banks abroad also have taken aggressive steps to keep markets steady. In an 8-1 vote on Thursday, the Bank of England said it would purchase an additional 100 billion pounds of government bonds to a total of 745 billion pounds. The bank voted unanimously to keep its interest rate at 0.1%.

"It's a timely thing to think about," says Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease specialist, internal medicine physician and veteran of the COVID-19 wars at University Health Network. "Every one of those deaths is an extremely sad and important event. Sometimes the human component can get lost in the mix, talking about numbers and statistics instead of acknowledging the lives they lived, the tragedy of death to them, their families, their friends. There's really no silver lining to a pandemic."

"We can see with 'Gone With the Wind' how profoundly people's understanding of American history has been shaped by these popular entertainments," says Stewart. "It's forcing us to confront the roots of racism in our country and to think about the role the media has played in shaping our understanding of race."

"This matter has a history of nearly four years and the Public Office Bearers Commission out of their benchmarking recommended this, to which the President granted approval nearly three years ago in tandem with commonwealth practice. In fact, we as a country are late, as our regional peers are far ahead," Venaani said yesterday.

“Police officers have to deal with the dregs of society, the worst of the worst,” added Steve Cook of Napa. “Any of these pantywaists saying we should defund the police, are they going to deal with those people?”


  The Napa demonstration began taking shape late last week and was modeled on a We Back Blue march Saturday in Washington, D.C., according to Francine Knittel and Sheri DeBow, organizers of the local event. A webackblue.com website lists similar rallies scheduled for Milwaukee on Saturday and Trenton, New Jersey on July 9, and eight others are in the works in other cites, said Knittel, a friend of the Washington event's organizer Melissa Robey.

On this week's show, NXT Champion Adam Cole (baby) is in a couple of backstage segments and then awkwardly transitions that into the ring so people can start interrupting him with promos of their own. First it's Keith Lee, who has been randomly confronting Cole backstage over the past couple of weeks and probably knows Cole's calling him out over the NXT North American Championship to avoid the NXT Championship itself being the thing they beef over. Before that can go anywhere, Johnny Heel Turn interrupts looking like a _Portal_ turret and says HE is the one who should be getting random additional title matches. Keith launches into a terrible bit about how Candice LeRae told him being fallen on and injured by a 320-pound man during a wrestling match is better than sex with her husband, but thankfully Finn Bálor interrupts to save the segment and try out some of the new wrestling jargon he learned on Wikipedia.

The measures taken by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in March to address the heightened volatility in the markets on the back of COVID-19 pandemic have been extended until July 30.


  “On review of the COVID-19 pandemic related situation, it has been decided that the regulatory measures introduced... dated March 20, 2020, shall continue to be in force till July 30, 2020,” SEBI said in a release on Thursday.


  In March, the watchdog had increased the margins in the cash segment while tightening the norms for position limits in the derivatives market as volatility continued to rise in the stock market on account of the pandemic.


  As part of the measures, the market wide position limit in certain stocks in the derivatives segment was revised to 50% and the penalty on an entity found to exceed the permissible limits was enhanced to 10 times of the current minimum and five times of the maximum penalty structure.


  Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds, among others, were allowed to take short positions in index derivatives only to the extent of the notional value of their holding in the underlying stocks.

After pressure from filmmakers, HBO Max temporarily removed the 1939 film. The highest grossing movie of all time despite its glamorized portrait of slavery in the Antebellum South, "Gone With the Wind" is part of an ignoble Hollywood legacy stretching back to "The Birth of a Nation." When the film returns to the streaming service, Turner Classic Movie host Jacqueline Stewart will contextualize it.

But as unanimous as that show of solidarity was, it was also clear that this wasn't a fight Hollywood could watch from the sidelines. As the uproar over "Gone With the Wind" showed, the movie industry has a past - and present - to reckon with. At a recent protest in Los Angeles, actor Michael B. Jordan turned his focus to the studio headquarters around him.

Par for the Course

"We've not been consistent enough, but having this time off it does bring that hunger back," Morrison said.


  The visit of Leeds will be Cardiff's first game in three months, after sporting fixtures were shelved as a result of the coronavirus crisis.


  The green light to return to training in Wales was only given three weeks ago, while managers and players both raised questions about the ability of football to return even behind closed doors.


  "There was a period where I thought we weren't going to play the season," Morrison said.


  "About six weeks in, when there were talks of the National League, Leagues One and Two being cancelled, you start to think there will be a lot of work to get football back on track.


  "I did think at one point it wouldn't happen, so fortunately a lot has been put into place"


  As Cardiff's skipper, the 29-year-old Morrison was involved in discussions with the English Football League (EFL) and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), where he said captains were able to voice their worries and find reassurance about the protocols and plans to return.


  "We had people with partners who were pregnant or had new-borns, lads with asthma or family members with underlying health issues," Morrison said.


  "There were issues, not only in our squad but all across the board and across the league.


  "It was about having the conversations and seeing the science and how we could get through this with the protocols being put into place. Once that was put in place it gave us an idea of how it would work.


  "It was more towards the end (of the process) - at the beginning we didn't have much of a clue - but the PFA were fantastic throughout and the EFL have answered any questions we had.


  "People have gone through very tough times, but hopefully with football being back it'll bring some joy back to people's lives.


  "But if we weren't able to do that in a safe environment, I know for a fact myself and a lot of the other lads that play professional football wouldn't have been happy to come back."

Now that they are, Cardiff's aims of returning to the Premier League following last season's relegation have been refocused.


  Having been part of the side that reached the top flight under Neil Warnock in 2018, Morrison accepts Cardiff's consistency has been lacking in a campaign that saw Neil Harris appointed as manager in November.


  Sensing an opportunity to put that right, Morrison said: "(This period) has shown me how much I love the game and how much I miss football, how much it's not there and that routine.


  "Having that team bond with a group of 25 lads, it's something I really did miss.


  "The boys have come back in great shape since we've been off which shows how dedicated we are to this and how much we want to hit the ground running.


  "For Cardiff City to get back to the Premier League is our goal. Hopefully all the work we have done at home and at the training ground can put us in good stead to make that leap forward towards the play-offs.


  "Training the last two weeks since we've been allowed contact has been full- steam ahead. Hopefully that light inside has been re-lit now.


  "It's nine games, a mini-season and give it everything because the Premier League is where every Championship club wants to be and it's no different for us."
