E sono già numerose le adesioni raccolte. “Quello che vogliamo lanciare – spiega Cristina Scappaticci, già responsabile di Terranostra Lazio, ora nella Giunta esecutiva, e a capo di un’azienda agricola ad Arpino - è un messaggio di speranza per affrontare questo momento difficile insieme, con l’augurio che quando tutto questo sarà finito, torneremo a condividere le tradizioni locali.

A third perspective is that this crisis may well reveal gaps in how you develop people. I have a friend who served in the military and who once told me that they train so much because in battle a sergeant may have to assume the duties of a lieutenant, or a private may have to assume the duties of a sergeant. In emergencies, leadership needs to be able to break out all over the place. If people are not properly trained, then they will not be able to step up. If you find that your organization falters because people are having a hard time stepping up, it might be worth looking at how robust and effective your training and development culture is. This crisis can serve as a testing ground for that culture. And if it is found wanting, you now know what to do.

Honda announced plans Wednesday morning to close for a week starting Monday, putting additional pressure on Detroit's automakers to follow suit. Toyota plants will close Monday and Tuesday, reopening Wednesday after what the company promised would be a thorough cleaning.
 In addition, Hyundai suspended production at its Montgomery, Alabama, plant Wednesday after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus. The company said production would resume once its health and safety team determines that the plant has been sufficiently sanitized.
 The decision by Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler reverses a deal worked out late Tuesday in which the three agreed to cancel some shifts so they could thoroughly cleanse equipment and buildings, but keep factories open. But workers, especially at some Fiat Chrysler factories, were still fearful and were pressuring the union to seek full closures.

The center has four sections: planning, operations, logistics and finance. All requests go through the center’s manager, who then triages tasks to the appropriate response section. The team has 13 people, including the mayor, Davis said.
 In other crises, the Emergency Operations Center met face to face in one room, but now they are coordinating via email, phone and video. The 13 members meet at the start of each day.
 “We’ve been very diligent about not being together in the same room,” Davis said. “We’re doing it all remotely from our own offices.”
