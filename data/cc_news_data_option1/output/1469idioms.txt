Attorney General Daniel Cameron issued a statement April 14 warning Kentuckians of new healthcare scams targeting Medicaid beneficiaries related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and encouraged consumers to report these scams to the Office of the Attorney General.
 “During the COVID-19 pandemic, scammers may target Medicaid beneficiaries in order to illegally bill the Medicaid program for unnecessary services and equipment related to coronavirus testing and treatment,” Cameron said in the statement. “Our Office of Medicaid Fraud and Abuse is committed to protecting the health and well-being of beneficiaries by stopping scammers who abuse the Medicaid program. We encourage anyone who believes they have been a victim of Medicaid fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic to immediately contact our Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Hotline at 1-877-ABUSE TIP.”
 To profit from the current health crisis, marketing organizations, telemedicine companies and labs may work together to solicit Medicaid beneficiaries for fraudulent COVID-19 testing. The marketing organization may provide an illegal kickback to a telemedicine company in order for a provider to sign off on administering both a COVID-19 test and a Respiratory Pathogen Panel Test (RPP Test). The RPP test is not required to test for COVID-19, but it allows the provider to bill the Medicaid program at a higher rate. Sites that administer testing using this illegal scheme often do not fully process the tests or provide beneficiaries with the results.

Rugby Australia and the players' union are inching closer to an agreement on an interim pay deal, but at least one Super Rugby team received some pay relief on Tuesday.
 RA and the the Rugby Union Players Association (RUPA) resumed talks after failing to thrash out an agreement on pay cuts over Easter.
 A two-hour video conference included player representatives from each of Australia's professional programs and the four Super Rugby teams.
 They were joined by RA directors Phil Waugh and Daniel Herbert, chief executive Raelene Castle, RUPA chairman Campbell Fisher and CEO Justin Harrison.
 "We have made good progress today following a meeting with RUPA and a number of players from across each of our professional teams," Castle said in a statement.
 "There are 192 professional players across the country and we understand RUPA wanting to consult broadly with their membership on these discussions.
 "Both parties appreciate what is at stake and the players recognise their role and shared responsibility in securing the future and helping the game navigate through this unprecedented challenge.
 "We thank RUPA and the players for working constructively towards finding a short-term solution to shore up the long-term future of Rugby in Australia."
 RA is believed to have asked the players to accept a 65 per cent wage reduction over a six-month period.
 There was some positive news for the Waratahs on Tuesday, after NSW Rugby decided to follow the recent example of the Brumbies in paying their players in full this month.
 It's believed back-dated adjustments will be made to their salaries later in the year, once an agreement on the scale of the pay cuts have been finalised.
 Earlier this month NSW Rugby stood down around 70 per cent of their non- playing staff including Waratahs' coach Rob Penney, who has returned to New Zealand for the time being.
 There had been suggestions the players would be stood down, but only as a final resort.
 The Reds and Rebels are due to pay their players later in the month, but by that time a pay cut agreement is expected to be in place.

Dear Dave,   I own a small company, and we lease the building we operate from. As an entrepreneur, how do you know when it is time to stop leasing and buy a place of your own?   Peter
 Dear Peter,   You should only buy a building when you have a solid track record of success, and a really good idea of what your building needs will be. A growing business is always a good thing, but you don't want to focus too much on real estate and not enough on generating revenue and managing that growth intelligently. You would also want to make sure you're going to be in anything you buy for a good, long while.
 I'm a big fan of leasing the first few years after starting your own business. It's even better if you can work out of your home, but I understand that's not always practical. Down the road, you can choose to lease with an option to buy, or, in the right situation, just buy a building.
 Remember, make sure you do it all with cash. Don't add debt to the equation!   Dave
 Is it ever too late?   Dear Dave,   Life insurance is one of those things I always said I would get around to buying someday, but, for various reasons, I just haven't done it yet. Is there ever a time when it is too late to get life insurance?   Angie
 Dear Angie,   First of all, I only recommend level term life insurance. It's fairly easy to get until around age 70, depending on your overall health situation. Once you get into your seventies and beyond, however, it can be more difficult to find reasonably priced coverage.
 I recommend that most people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in term life insurance. To be honest, though, you really shouldn't need life insurance if you're 70 or older. At that point, if you've saved and invested wisely over the years, you can be self-insured. By this, I mean you've got enough money in savings and investments to cover funeral expenses - plus enough for a spouse to live on comfortably after you're gone.
 Don't wait any longer, Angie. Take care of this today!   Dave

Peter V'landys has been forced to confirm NRL teams will not be stripped of competition points earned in the first two rounds despite a stunning push from Sydney Roosters boss Nick Politis.
 The Australian Rugby League Commission chairman has again confirmed the NRL is not considering taking away competition points as it considers ways to restart the competition next month.
 "The points will stand," V'landys told The Daily Telegraph on Monday.
 "There is no way we are taking anyone's points away. It isn't even on the table."
 Politis copped plenty of criticism for his renewed call to start the season again, with undefeated Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy saying the Roosters' chief was "just trying to look after his own club".
 Politis argued all results should be wiped ahead of the planned May 28 resumption to ensure the "integrity" of the game, saying it had nothing to do with the two-time defending premiers' 0-2 season start.
 It's the second time in a week V'landys has been forced to step in and quash the suggestion points will be stripped from the opening fortnight after it had been floated originally by NRL Innovation Committee head Wayne Pearce.
 It caused uproar with fans and clubs, particularly the 10 teams who scored a win over the first two weeks.
 "It would be pretty devastating, we obviously started the season pretty good and would have been a bit upsetting to have those points taken away," Mitch Moses told Fox Sports. The playmaker steered Parramatta to the top of the NRL ladder with two wins.
 Even winless Gold Coast believe results for the first two rounds should remain when the NRL resumes this year.
 Fellow winless outfits the Warriors and Cronulla have echoed Politis' controversial call and the last-placed Titans would be forgiven for doing the same.
 Titans coach Justin Holbrook's debut season started with two losses and a whopping -58 points differential.
 But on Monday, the cellar dwellers said they couldn't see the logic in starting the season next month from scratch.
 "The results should stand," Titans executive chairman Dennis Watt told AAP.
 "All teams worked hard for those results and they should be very much part of the 2020 season."

Never forget, the original projection was 1-2.2 million deaths. Even that is looking patently ridiculous in light of new data. Iceland has randomly tested approximately 10% of their population. Fifty percent of positive cases are asymptomatic. The CDC's most recent estimate was that 25% of cases are without symptoms. This would change both the case severity rate and death rate significantly. Iceland's only significant restriction is on gatherings larger than 20. Most shops and businesses are still open. As of Friday they had seven deaths or a death rate of 0.4%. Not the 1.0-3.5% that has been thrown around.

Hodson said he’s not sure how long the promotions will run, but it will at least be for several days. The first restaurant featured Tuesday, April 14, was Del Rancho. Owner Steve Fennell said his business has always had a lot of takeout customers, but now, it’s the eatery’s only option.
 “So while our sales are down, we’re getting a lot of good response from our customers,” he said. “We’re just moving right along with the flow of things. We are adapting. We’ve not laid any employees off, thankfully. We’re keeping busy finding projects and things to clean in the restaurant and just trying to take care of customers as best we can. While we’re not trying to entice people out of their homes, we are available for people if they are out and about.”
 Like many restaurants, Del Rancho has changed its hours. It still opens at 6 a.m., seven days a week, but is now closing at 9:30 p.m.
 Meanwhile, Hodson’s office remains open, albeit a different manner, as the State Farm office has begun offering its own drive-thru service.
 “We’re still trying to operate the best we can,” said Hodson. “So we’re still taking the payments through that and doing as much business and whatever business our clients are wanting. We’re trying to avoid any personal contact other than that, and we’re taking steps to protect our employees, too, with distancing within our business.”

Harry Kane revealed that Tottenham believe they can beat any opposition after their 2-1 away win against Manchester City kept them firmly in the mix for the Premier League title.
 The England international swept home from the penalty spot before Christian Eriksen struck Spurs' decisive second after Kelechi Iheanacho had drawn the home side level on Sunday.
 Mauricio Pochettino's side are now just two points behind league leaders Leicester City and, while Kane insists they will not get carried away, the striker feels confidence is now sky-high within a squad still in the hunt to win three trophies.
 When asked if he considered Spurs to be title challengers, he told Sky Sports: "That's up to you to decide - we know what we are capable of.
 "We feel we can beat anyone in the league and we fancy our chances against anyone.
 "It was a very big game, away at City who are a top team. Everyone is fighting for places so to come away with a win is a good feeling.
 "But there is a long way to go. We are in three competitions and are taking them all seriously. Coming here and getting three points will give us confidence.
 "It was a good open game. We have to keep going and do the right things. We can't get carried away but it is a big away win."

Among those, Rondo who has largely sat seems like a lock to opt for another year. Bradley has started but has swayed in his offensive production and his injury history could hurt his market elsewhere. McGee has outperformed his contract, but he’s also at center, which is the hardest position to get paid as a role player. Caldwell-Pope might have the best market of any of these players, but that market could be slashed due to the sinking salary cap, and perhaps L.A.’s chance to win makes it a little more appealing. It seems more likely than not that the Lakers see a lot of player options exercised in light of the uncertainty of 2020 free agency, which limits their own ability to make summer moves.

Newcastle went into the coronavirus shutdown undefeated and despite the disruptions skipper Mitchell Pearce plans to keep it that way, when the NRL competition resumes in 2020.
 For the Knights, winning the opening two games against the Warriors and Wests Tigers was a huge boost to their confidence under new coach Adam O'Brien.
 However, speaking on Fox League on Tuesday night, Pearce said an injury to hooker Jayden Brailey will be a big hurdle for the Knights to overcome for the title.
 "I really do (believe we can win the competition)," Pearce said.
 "For us, it was a really big kick in the backside to lose Jayden Brailey with an ACL injury."
 Brailey went down with a knee problem midway through the round two win over the Tigers and the devastating news was later confirmed, despite his ability to finish the game.
 The 23-year-old underwent an ACL reconstruction and is looking at a rehabilitation period of around six months.
 "I always knew he was a good player when he was coming to the club, I was really excited to get stability there with Jayden, but he's an even better player than I thought he was," Pearce said.
 "He's a real team man, he's got a lot of Danny Buderus about him.
 "He's a team first player and he's really composed and has a good temperament.
 "It's going to be a bit of a struggle and put us back a little bit without Jayden, like losing any great player in your team but we've got enough players there to still get a good job done and I'm confident we can get the job done."
 As the NRL pushes ahead with plans to reboot the season in late May, players are training in isolation until given the all clear to resume with teammates in the coming weeks.
 Pearce said the key to continuing their form when the season restarts, potentially on May 28, is maintaining focus.
 "I think every club is the same," he said.
 "Everyone's coaching staff is driving them to stay fit so that's the main thing.
 "That month leading into the first game will be huge, the amount of work to get done with the group so you can hit the ground running, especially if it's only going to be a 15-round competition.
 "You want to start fast. We just have to wait and see what the layout of the comp is going to be and go from there."

An anticipated Easter resolution to the pay talks between Rugby Australia and the players' union hasn't eventuated by early Monday evening, with the clock now ticking especially loud for the NSW Waratahs.
 Going into Easter RA had been optimistic of getting a deal on salary cuts done with the Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) by the end of the holiday period.
 However, there was no formal phone hookup between the two parties on Monday and by the evening there was no details of any official talks scheduled for Tuesday,
 The Waratahs players are scheduled to be paid on Wednesday and it was hoped an agreement would be struck before then.
 The NSW Rugby Union board is not expected to meet before then, though CEO Paul Doorn and Waratahs chairman Roger Davis are in regular contact.
 It's believed RA has proposed a 65 cent pay cut for the country's Super Rugby players over a six-month period.
 RUPA is believed to be concerned about committing to a six-month deal, especially if play resumed within that period
 NSW Rugby stood down a significant portion of its non-playing workforce, believed to be around 70 per cent, back on April 1.
 Standing down their players without pay is one option if a deal isn't reached before Wednesday, but is being considered more as a last resort.
 Another option would be to pay them in full on Wednesday and take a backdated bigger portion than the eventually agreed percentage out of future wages.

So about that: It’s getting to be decision time. After his second year when the Lakers kept him in favor of trading Brandon Ingram (now an All-Star) and Lonzo Ball, a future extension seemed like a no-brainer. Now it’s not as clear, and neither is his value to the Lakers. Is he worth starter money? Role-player money? How much does he think he’s worth? The postseason could have helped clarify his value to a team trying to win a title; the suspension has so far robbed the Lakers of the opportunity to see that. It seems more feasible nowthan it did last summer that the Lakers hold off on a Kuzma extension offer, either holding onto him for a year before he’s a restricted free agent, or dangling him out as trade bait (something to which Kuzma is uncomfortably familiar). If the Lakers now think that Kuzma’s development doesn’t fit their expedited title window, now even tighter because of coronavirus, it might be as likely as ever that Kuzma (making $3.5 million next year) gets dealt for another piece.

NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller is supportive of interstate NRL teams being based in the state as he continues to back the game to restart late next month.
 Fuller insisted on Monday that the NRL was just like other businesses attempting to stay open, provided it met the health requirements outlined to the game in a letter last week.
 He also said he would work with the health department to allow teams to travel to the state to train and play, with as many as six sides set to do so from across state borders and New Zealand.
 Teams would begin training from early next month, before the planned resumption of the competition on May 28.
 "I would certainly be happy to work with health in terms of teams coming here and undertaking reasonable isolation," Fuller said.
 "This has all been about protecting the people of NSW. Health is number one and it will remain that.
 "Social distancing and hygiene, the Premier has said will go on for not months, but years.
 "But when restrictions change businesses need to be ready to move. There's no point in waiting.
 "You need to think about hygiene and social distancing now for the coming months."
 Fuller's letter to the NRL last Wednesday gave the game confidence it could resume, based on a public health order that did not prohibit racing and sport from continuing.
 The letter detailed that the game had to be played behind closed doors, and in venues big enough to allow for social distancing.
 "What I sent was NSW-based advice, based on information from our lawyers. It wasn't a legal thing given by myself," Fuller said.
 "The reality is they will have to overcome some work health and safety guidelines.
 "From my perspective we are concerned about employment as well in the state of NSW.
 "And we have worked closely with Bunnings, Coles and Woolworths so they can operate. I think it's important we do that.
 "If they can play and it meets the health criteria then I wish them well and I'm sure there will be plenty of other codes that will watch them closely."

Retiring Brisbane star Darius Boyd has smacked down suggestions Queensland players should relocate to NSW to finish the season, saying there's "no chance in hell" he would move away from his family.
 The 32-year-old will retire at the end of the NRL season, but when that will be is yet to be determined.
 As the NRL ploughs through ideas to get the season up and running again on May 28, it has been proposed non-NSW teams will need to relocate to Sydney for the duration of the competition to bypass border restrictions between states.
 However, Boyd, who has a young family in Brisbane, says he would rather end his career early than live away from home for months at a time.
 "No chance in hell I could do four months away from my family and that's something I wouldn't be OK with," Boyd told the Seven Network.
 "The game of rugby league is very important to a lot of people (but) at the end of the day your mental health and wellbeing is a lot more important."
 The NRL is hell bent on restarting the competition in seven weeks' time and it's hoped border restrictions will be relaxed before then as the infection rate of coronavirus continues to drop in Australia.
 North Queensland coach Paul Green said he has not spoken at length with his playing group about potentially relocating to Sydney, and doesn't intend to until there are concrete plans in the works.
 "I think there's still a lot of unknowns so we don't really want to speculate too much on it until we can get some concrete ways forward," he told Fox League on Tuesday night.
 "Safety is the number one concern so whatever the comp looks like and whatever we have to do, as long as it's safe and abides by the rules, we're committed to trying to get the games back on."
 Earlier on Tuesday, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she would not be comfortable sending Queensland clubs Gold Coast, Brisbane and North Queensland to Sydney in order to avoid quarantine laws and ensure the NRL's resumption.
 "I'm really concerned about my Queensland players going down to Sydney," she said.
 "All you need is one community transmission down in Sydney and the whole team could possibly have it.
 "It would have to be very strict quarantine. I'd have to get health advice from my chief health officer.
 "I don't want to put a spanner in the works here, but we're either going to listen to the health advice or we're not - I'm not making any apologies for that."

A lot of folks are on board with the way things went, while others are always going to be a little angry over it. But that's just how it goes. With a film as massive as _Endgame,_ it was never going to be able to please everyone.

Star striker Harry Kane insists Tottenham fear no one as they continue to mount a serious Premier League title challenge this season.
 Tottenham are second in the table after 25 games, sitting five points behind surprise league-leaders Leicester City.
 Despite failing to score in his first six league games of the campaign, Kane has netted 15 times this season - including four in his last four appearances.
 And as Tottenham prepare to face fellow title contenders Manchester City on Sunday, Kane has warned the rest of the league that they can beat anyone.
 "We don’t fear anyone," the 22-year-old said. "We are happy to go there [Etihad Stadium] and play our football and we’re excited.
 "We’re playing well but we’ve got to stay focused. We know we can beat anyone in the league and that’s the attitude we have to keep.
 "We are all working towards the same aim and hopefully we can keep winning games and getting better.
 "This is a game we can win and we’re playing well. City will want to put things right, but we’re on a great run and the more games that come, the better.
 "There is still a long way to go. So we have got to keep focused and continue what we are doing."

Actually, what the data is telling us is that the mitigation we are doing is far more effective than originally thought or the assumptions in the model were always wrong. The case severity has never matched the level of hospital beds required by the model even as the number of infections rises. The death rate was revised down _after_ it had assumed significant mitigation in the initial projection. And after those monitoring it like Alex and Sean pointed out the significant misses across the board.

“It feels like one more miracle. I’ve always seen miracles happen at Genesis House and this is another one,” she said. “I’m feeling very grateful for this timely gift that will greatly impact our clients. It’s scary right now. The clients we have we’re struggling before this pandemic, so they’re struggling even harder now to make ends meet and live through one more harsh obstacle in their lives.”
 The funds will be put to good use, as the executive director said they’ll go toward supplementing bills the nonprofit’s clients have that are tied to basic needs, such as housing, food, medicine and utilities.
