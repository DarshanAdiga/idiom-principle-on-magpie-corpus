Given the nature of this virus, it seems likely that we won‚Äôt go from zero to highway speed quickly. Experts warn the coronavirus or some of its mutated forms could be with us through the end of the year, and perhaps longer. That‚Äôs not what business owners, worker or consumers really want to hear, but hear it they must.
 The flip side of this potential for restarting the local economy is that if we don‚Äôt do a good enough job of stopping the disease, it could come back with a vengeance ‚Äî and we have to go though the closed-businesses, stay-at-home cycle all over again. Nobody wants that.

Those migrant labourers who are coming in will be offered employment. I would request those that they stay here only. We have enough employment opportunities. Those who kick out people from their states will be given employment here, said CM Banerjee. She added that from May 21, more relaxations will be allowed in the state adding that more buses and cabs will be pressed into service. Taking a jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), she asked the party to resume a political fight with her later. She accused the BJP of trying to spread riots at a time when a fight against the pandemic is going on. CM Banerjee asked the BJP to fight her during the state polls and urged to stand united against coronavirus COVID-19. In this crisis time, we are fighting this pandemic. BJP is trying to spread riots and putting it out on Twitter. You have all the time in the world to fight me in politics, there‚Äôs a years time for polls here. Please hold your horses and be patient.

Why not help the cleaning staff, medical staff and police? It‚Äôs easy to vandalise and torch police vehicles. We will not allow this, she said. Speaking on the violent incident in Hoogly s Telinipara, she said, I have told the police to take the strictest action. Those who violated the lockdown and indulged in communal clashes will be tried under the National Disaster Management Act. None will be spared. We will not see whether the person belongs to community A or community B. Speaking on the testing labs in the county, she said, Our testing was low because we only had four labs. We had to request the Centre to allow us permission for setting up of labs. On the lockdown, she said, This lockdown was unplanned. Hence the migrant labourers are suffering. Migrants have been beaten up in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. Migrants are being kept in deplorable condition. Some not given food, some not given place to stay. Many migrants are COVID-19 infected as they were not taken care of. Had they returned to homes earlier, our COVID-19 cases would have remained low too. Amid the incidents of violence at Hooghly district s Telinipara and at Malda district s Chandipur, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar appealed to the communities to maintain communal harmony. Expressing serious concern, he has called upon the people to observe utmost restraint at all costs. He urged the police and administration to be extremely watchful so that the situation is contained. A delegation of BJP comprising Locket Chatterjee, MP, Arjun Singh MP, Mukul Roy, Member, National Council, Pratap Banerjee, General Secretary and Sabyasachi Dutta, MLA, called on the Governor and raised concerns about the alarming communal situation in the state. The delegation referred to the recent incidents of communal violence in Malda and Murshidabad in particular. The incident on May 10 in Malda district in Chandipur indicated a serious issue of communal violence. They referred to the most unfortunate incident of damage to the idol of a temple and sought forthwith intervention. Governor Dhankhar told the members of the delegation that these are critical times for the state and irrespective of political affiliations, all must be singlemindedly focussed on sharpening battle against COVID-19. Governor Dhankhar appealed to the people at large to focus all their energies to deal with the issue of migrants, health and PDS and work only in that direction. He assured the Members of the delegation that he would look into the matter and seek appropriate inputs from the concerned authorities so that the state observes communal harmony at all costs.

 Rankin, married to his wife Shirley for 50 years and the parent of two children, has continued to maintain his active hands-on involvement in the schools even after retirement following a 41-year career.
 He still serves as a volunteer at Lake Norman High School, working as a bus driver and with athletic field maintenance.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Last week, there were two big bankruptcy stories: clothing retailer J. Crew, which filed on Monday, and car-rental agency Hertz, which narrowly avoided the same fate by negotiating an 11th-hour reprieve from creditors.
 It might be a little surprising that Hertz got the forbearance, since on paper, Hertz is arguably in a worse position than J. Crew. Two-thirds of the car-rental industry‚Äôs business comes from air travelers, and it seems safe to say that most people will be slipping back into chinos and espadrilles before they‚Äôll be cramming themselves into airplanes again.

Para Matias Alonso "nada es casual en esa escena; el propio encuadre, totalmente forzado y antinatural, reparte el protagonismo entre el concejal y Franco con la bandera que no refleja mas que la hipocresia de las derechas espa√±olas por delante del mensaje inicial del video. El Papa queda relegado a un tercer lugar testimonial".
 "Tal escenificacion convierte el video supuestamente pastoral en una ofensa a quienes intervienen en el de buena fe, comprometiendo a la Iglesia con una intervencion esencialmente politica del concejal utilizando de fondo una escenografia que desmiente cualquier otro mensaje, ademas de constituir un homenaje publico al odio y la intolerancia totalmente anticonstitucional que cualquier democrata debe rechazar frontalmente" se√±ala el responsable socialista.
 Segun el Presidente del GRMHCV "Antonio Diaz convirtio en un homenaje publico al franquismo su intervencion ante una serie de iconos que nada tienen que ver con la Semana Santa. Exigimos su dimision por la utilizacion del video para colar su propio homenaje encubierto y un mensaje politico partidista en medio de una lucha general por salir de la tragedia".
 "Exigimos esa dimision porque el PP de Torrebaja niega con este capitulo la supuesta constitucionalidad de las derechas espa√±olas y podria estar comprometiendo tambien a la propia Iglesia de la comarca traicionando su buena fe; en tiempos de lucha y afliccion no es este el mensaje en el que debe salir involucrada" afirma Alonso.
 Finalmente el responsable del PSPV afirma que "es mezquino y desleal aprovechar la tragedia para sacar redito politico de la lucha de todo el pueblo espa√±ol; todos estamos en esta guerra contra el coronavirus y exigimos que por respeto a todas las victimas no se utilice la memoria para reventar la unidad de todos por la vida y la normalidad".

In the NBA's inaugural season back in 1946, the league played a total of 60 games with 11 teams. Throughout their first few seasons, and up until the 1952-53 season, the regular season consisted of about 60 or so games. Following that season, 72 games became the norm, gradually increasing until the 1967-68 season when the league settled on the standard 82 game season that we know today.

Third method. Gold does not oxidize like silver, which easily blackens. On the other hand, it can change color if subjected to a powerful laser energy beam. It is not a simple procedure to carry out, because it requires machines powerful enough to intervene on the molecular structure of the metal. So, is this how you get black gold? Yes and no. In theory, jewelry could be made with gold subjected to a laser treatment, but unfortunately it is rather complicated and expensive. Hence, your black gold jewelry is almost certainly not the result of laser treatment.

The American Hockey League canceled the rest of its season Monday because of the coronavirus pandemic and shifted its focus toward next season.
   
 While the Calder Cup will not be handed out for the first time since 1936, the 31-team AHL hopes to return next season. That remains uncertain; one possibility is that no fans would be allowed in arenas.
   
 President and CEO David Andrews announced the league "has determined that the resumption and completion of the 2019-20 season is not feasible in light of current conditions." The AHL's Board of Governors made that determination in a conference call Friday.
   
 "It's something that was essentially inevitable," said Syracuse defenseman Cameron Gaunce, who is an AHL executive committee member for the Professional Hockey Players Association. "I think they had been waiting for this point because they wanted to see if there had been any changes, and I think that was the responsible way to go about it. They didn't want to make any knee-jerk reactions either way."
   
 The 84th season for the NHL's top minor league was suspended March 12 with 209 games remaining. That was the same day the NHL stopped play, though it still hopes to resume and could include many AHL players as part of expanded rosters. At the time of the suspension, the Providence Bruins were in first place in the Atlantic Division, with a 38-18 record.
   
 "We are very grateful to the National Hockey League and its teams for their support and leadership in navigating through the challenges faced over the past two months," Andrews said. "The AHL continues to place paramount importance on the health and safety of our players, officials, staff and fans and all of their families, and we all look forward to returning to our arenas in 2020-21."
   
 The Providence Bruins issued a statement thanking season ticket holders, fans and corporate partners and recognized the team's on-ice success, including a historic 12-game game winning streak en route to a first-place finish in the Eastern Conference.
   
 PHPA executive director Larry Landon recently said he's concerned about the ability of the AHL and ECHL -- which canceled the rest of its season in March -- returning if it's not safe for fans.
   
 "You don't know what's going to happen, whether there's going to be an AHL season next year," said Gaunce, whose NHL/AHL contract with Tampa Bay is set to expire after this season. "The AHL and the NHL are going to do everything they can to make sure that the AHL is active next year and you hope that's the case. But if it is, what's it going to look like? If ticket revenues aren't part of the revenue stream for a lot of these teams, that's going to affect a lot of their bottom lines. And if that's the case, how many expenses are they really going to be willing to take on? So it's something that's up in the air."

Their scheduled international tours unlikely to go ahead due to coronavirus pandemic, the cricket boards of Australia and New Zealand are exploring the possibility of creating a constant stream of matches between the two neighbouring nations.
 With the two governments planning to open up a corridor to allow a quarantine- free travel, New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White discussed the possibility with his Cricket Australia counterpart Kevin Roberts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked to Kevin Roberts about that. A Tasman bubble would be terrific if it did eventuate,‚Äù White told _Sydney Morning Herald_.
 ‚Äú...it would present some opportunities going forward. But I think the key is to keep an open mind and be flexible so if opportunities do arise we can take them. We haven‚Äôt talked specifics really. What we have talked about is conceptually the possibility of playing each other and that‚Äôs where we are at the moment.‚Äù
 With the 13th Indian Premier League suspended indefinitely, the Test tour of Bangladesh abandoned and a limited-overs tour of England in July also likely to be called off, Australia will be without any cricket action this winter. There are also doubts over the T20 World Cup scheduled to be held in October- November in Australia.
 New Zealand‚Äôs home international summer is also uncertain with Pakistan and West Indies scheduled to tour for Tests and Sri Lanka in the shorter form.

The Eagles' efforts to get younger and faster comes with the realization that some of those younger players have to actually play, and play well.
   
 That means players drafted from 2017-19 especially have to make meaningful contributions this season.
   
 That's because in many cases they're replacing established veterans. That might even include players drafted this year, especially first-round pick Jalen Reagor, a wide receiver, and fourth-round pick K'Von Wallace, a safety.
   
 And really, if second-round pick Jalen Hurts is going to be the backup quarterback, he'll have to be ready if starter Carson Wentz gets hurt, too. But the Eagles' success hinges more on Wentz staying healthy than Hurts having to contribute.
   
 In some areas, the Eagles can continue to rely on veterans.
   
 That's true in the secondary with Darius Slay at one cornerback spot, and veterans Rodney McLeod, Will Parks and the converted cornerback Jalen Mills at safety.
   
 Here's a look at some of the young players who will have to make a major contribution for the first time, in order for the Eagles' plan to succeed.
   
 Note: We're not including tight end Dallas Goedert and cornerback Avonte Maddox, both drafted in 2018; or defensive end Derek Barnett and linebacker Nathan Gerry, both drafted in 2017. They already have significant roles.
   
 Andre Dillard
   
 The above-mentioned health of Wentz could depend in large part on Dillard, the left tackle who's replacing future Hall of Famer Jason Peters. Dillard, the Eagles' first-round pick in 2019, started three games in place of Peters, and did reasonably well.
   
 But with right tackle Lane Johnson an established Pro Bowl player, it's likely that Dillard will face many of the opponents' top rushers. He might have to handle the likes of Washington rookie Chase Young in the season opener, for example.
   
 There's a chance that Peters could return to the Eagles. The free agent has yet to sign with another team. But it's likely that if Peters does return, it would be as a backup or insurance policy in case Dillard gets hurt or struggles.
   
 J.J. Arcega-Whiteside
   
 Arcega-Whiteside's rookie season was disappointing to say the least, with just 10 catches for 169 yards.
   
 The Eagles seemed to have compensated for the possibility that Arcega- Whiteside, the second-round pick in 2019, might not pan out. They drafted Reagor in the first round, traded for Marquise Goodwin, then drafted John Hightower and Quez Watkins in the fifth and sixth rounds, respectively.
   
 Arcega-Whiteside could have a significant role this season if the Eagles decide to release or trade Alshon Jeffery.
   
 He could also get a chance if DeSean Jackson and/or Goodwin, who have had injury issues the past several seasons, get hurt this season.
   
 Ideally, the Eagles would love for Arcega-Whiteside to play a major role. If he can't, the Eagles likely won't be as patient with him as they were with some other young players, such as ...
   
 Sidney Jones
   
 Eagles general manager Howie Roseman has already gone on record saying that Jones, the Eagles' second-round pick in 2017, is pretty much down to his last chance after three seasons of injuries and inconsistent play.
   
 That was especially true last season when Jones, the Eagles' second-round pick in 2017, made game-saving plays in two games late in the season, yet couldn't get on the field for the playoff game against Seattle.
   
 Jones will have a chance to compete for a starting cornerback job opposite of Slay. It's expected that Maddox will be the main competitor for that spot, with Rasul Douglas, the Eagles' third-round pick in 2017, either moving on or staying as a reserve.
   
 If Jones wins the job, he can expect to see plenty of action as opponents will test him with Slay on the other side.
   
 Josh Sweat
   
 So far, the Eagles haven't signed a veteran pass rusher to rotate in with starters Brandon Graham, who's 32 years old, and 2017 first-round pick Derek Barnett, who has yet to truly have a breakout season.
   
 The Eagles are putting a lot of faith in Sweat, their fourth-round pick in 2018 who had 4 sacks last season. Sweat, along with Genard Avery, should be a part of the rotation at defensive end.
   
 In the past three seasons, the Eagles have had veterans Vinny Curry (last season), Michael Bennett (2018) and Chris Long (2017 and 2018) as rotational pass rushers. There are some veterans still available. But free agent Jadeveon Clowney, as well as Yannick Ngakoue via trade, both would be very costly.
   
 The Eagles are taking a gamble that Sweat and Avery can help out while hoping that Graham and Barnett are productive and healthy.
   
 T.J. Edwards
   
 The Eagles allowed their top two linebackers from last season to leave in Nigel Bradham and Kamu Grugier-Hill.
   
 The Eagles replaced them with a free agent in Jatavis Brown, who started one game last season for the Los Angeles Chargers, along with two draft picks -- Davion Taylor in the third round and Temple's Shaun Bradley in the sixth.
   
 But Taylor is relatively inexperienced, and will likely start out on special teams. And Bradley might also need some time to adjust to the NFL.
   
 Nathan Gerry, the Eagles' fifth-round pick in 2017, became a regular starter last season. That leaves Edwards, whom the Eagles signed as an undrafted free agent last May, as another starter.
   
 Edwards started four games last season, but never played more than 38% of the defensive snaps. He has the opportunity to be one of the two main linebackers.

‚ÄúThe people who are getting sick right now are generally people who are working,‚Äù Dr. Mark Escott, a regional health official, told Austin‚Äôs city council. ‚ÄúThat risk is going to increase the more people are working.‚Äù
 Austin‚Äôs concerns will likely be mirrored in communities nationwide as the reopening of stores and factories creates new opportunities for the virus to spread.
 To be sure, there are plenty of new infections outside the workplace ‚Äî in nursing homes, and among retired and unemployed people, particularly in densely populated places such as New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and urban parts of New Jersey and Massachusetts.
 Yet of the 15 U.S. counties with the highest per-capita infection rates between April 28 and May 5, all are homes to meatpacking and poultry- processing plants or state prisons, according to data compiled by The Associated Press.
 The county with the highest per-capita rate was Tennessee‚Äôs Trousdale County, where nearly 1,300 inmates and 50 staffers recently tested positive at the privately run Trousdale Turner Correctional Center.
 In the federal prison system, the number of positive cases has increased steadily. As of May 5, there were 2,066 inmates who‚Äôd tested positive, up from 730 on April 25.
 The No. 2 county on AP‚Äôs list is Nobles County in Minnesota, which now has about 1,100 cases, compared to two in mid-April. The county seat, Worthington, is home to a JBS pork processing plant that employs hundreds of immigrants.
 ‚ÄúOne guy said to me, ‚ÄòI risked my life coming here. I never thought something that I can‚Äôt see could take me out,‚Äô‚Äù said the Rev. Jim Callahan of St. Mary‚Äôs Catholic Church in Worthington.
 Nebraska‚Äôs Dakota County, home to a Tyson Foods meat plant, had recorded three cases as of April 15, and now has more than 1,000. There have been at least three COVID-19 deaths, including a Muslim woman from Ethiopia who was among 4,300 employees at the Tyson plant.
 ‚ÄúThese are sad and dangerous days,‚Äù the imam of a regional Islamic center, Ahmad Mohammad, told the Siouxland News.
 In northern Indiana‚Äôs Cass County, home to a large Tyson pork-processing plant, confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 1,500. That‚Äôs given the county ‚Äî home to about 38,000 residents ‚Äî one of the nation‚Äôs highest per- capita infection rates.
 The Tyson plant in Logansport, Indiana, was closed April 25 after nearly 900 employees tested positive; it resumed limited operations Thursday after undergoing deep cleaning and installation of Plexiglas workstation barriers. Company spokeswoman Hli Yang said none of the 2,200 workers would return to work without being tested.

Some users will also like the iPhone SE's home button. Now that Apple is discontinuing the iPhone 8, the iPhone SE will be the only iPhone Apple will sell with a physical home button. In addition to being intuitive to use, it also means you don't have to use swipe gestures to return to the home screen or call up recent apps. The home button will also house the device's fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone and authorizing digital payments (what Apple calls Touch ID). The iPhone 11, however, uses facial mapping sensors on the front-facing camera for biometric security (aka Face ID).
 The devices are both IP certified for water protection. But because the iPhone 11 is rated IP68 compared to the iPhone SE's IP67 rating, it means that the iPhone 11 is a tad more durable against submersion (as in, it's certified to withstand longer or deeper immersion in water). On paper, an IP67 level of certification means the iPhone SE can survive in up to a meter (3.3 feet) of water for about 30 minutes.
 Lastly, the iPhone SE only comes in black, white and red. The iPhone 11 comes in those three colors, too, but if you want more options, you can also get it in pastel yellow, green and purple.
 ## Camera: iPhone 11 has the upper hand
 If you're not necessarily a camera power user, the iPhone SE's single 12-megapixel rear camera should suffice for posting images on Instagram and casual video recording. But if you care about photography or want more tools at your disposal, the iPhone 11 has a notably better camera setup than the iPhone SE.

In this lifetime, the top two that come to mind are the New York Knicks' first-round win over the Miami HEAT in the 1999 playoffs and the Denver Nuggets come-from- behind win over the Seattle Supersonics in the 1994 version. In today's format, Allan Houston's game-winner would've just given the Knicks a 3-2 lead and Miami might have still been able to win that series.

BERLIN - The Bundesliga returns on Saturday to empty stadiums, and German fans are being warned to stay away and authorities have warned matches could be halted if too many supporters gather outside the grounds.
 German football will be blazing a trail among Europe's top leagues by resuming two months after it was halted by the spread of coronavirus, but its strategy is fraught with risks.
 In a football-mad country which boasts the highest average attendances in the world, will supporters banished from stadiums be able to stay away?
 In Saxony, where third-placed RB Leipzig will host mid-table Freiburg on Saturday afternoon, the state's Interior Minister Roland Woeller has issued a clear threat.
 "Fans must not use matches behind closed doors as an excuse to gather in front of the stadiums or elsewhere," he said.
 "This could lead to matches being stopped."
 His concerns are justified.
 Several hundred fans gathered in Moenchengladbach when the hosts beat 2-1 Cologne on March 11 -- the only previous German league game played behind locked doors, just days before the shutdown.
 Eintracht Frankfurt have appealed to their supporters before they resume their season against 'Gladbach on Saturday.
 "We've talked a lot with our fans and said: 'listen guys, don't show up at the stadium'," Frankfurt's sports director Fredi Bobic told ESPN.
 Under German league rules put in place to resume the season, the home side is responsible for ensuring fans do not try to approach the stadium to support their team from a distance.
 After weeks of meticulous planning and mass testing of players and backroom staff, it would be a nightmare for the Bundesliga if the fans were to derail the fragile recovery attempt.
 Christian Seifert, CEO of the Bundesliga, does not expect fans to play into the hands of critics who fear they will mass outside grounds despite large public events being banned in Germany.
 Seifert accused the critics predicting that football fans would fail to respect the pleas for restraint of making "sweeping statements".
 "I don't believe that the fan scene and the fan organisations will do their critics... the favour of behaving in exactly the way" that those doomsayers fear, he said.
 The Bundesliga boss said all the talks he had held on the issue "do not give any indication" that supporters will gather.
 Broadcaster Sky has agreed to show some of Saturday's matches on a free-to-air channel, allaying fears that fans will gather in bars or public places which have a subscription for the pay-per-view service.

NEW DELHI - Scrapping the money-spinning Indian Premier League this year because of the coronavirus pandemic would cost more than half a billion dollars, but cutting players' pay was not yet being considered, a top official has told AFP.
 The world's richest Twenty20 tournament is staring at a first wipeout in its 12-year history after the original March 29 start date was postponed repeatedly.
 Cancellation of the IPL for 2020 would mean a huge financial hit.
 "The BCCI is looking at a big revenue loss. In case the IPL does not take place, the loss would be close to 40 billion rupees ($530 million), or even more," said Board of Control for Cricket in India treasurer Arun Dhumal.
 India, like other cricket nations, is anxious to see a return to competitive international sport, but has to follow government orders and advice.
 "We are not sure whether we will be able to have it this year," he admitted.
 A one-day international series against South Africa in March has already been cancelled but it is the IPL, which began in 2008, that generates the bulk of BCCI revenue and is thought to be worth more than $11 billion a year to the Indian economy.
 "We will only be able to figure out the exact revenue loss once we are sure of how many games we have lost," said Dhumal.
 The IPL brand value was estimated at $6.7 billion last year by the Duff and Phelps financial consultancy.
 Indian broadcaster Star Sports paid more than $220 million for five years of TV rights up to 2022. But it was reportedly targeting $400 million of revenue in 2020 alone.
     * 'Safety is paramount' -   Gripped by an international lockdown, many national boards have been forced into cost-cutting.
   
 Cricket Australia has laid off most of its staff while the England and Wales Cricket Board has announced pay cuts.
 Other top sports, such as football's English Premier League and Spain's La Liga, have also seen players accept wage cuts.
 But Dhumal, who joined the BCCI leadership last year alongside president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah, said that it was hoped to avoid pay cuts for players.
 "That would be the last thing that we would want to do at our end," said Dhumal.
 "That is why we are working (on) how much is the loss finally we have to pay.
 "So once we are able to assess that then we might consider it, but it will be the last thing on our agenda."
 Dhumal said India's tour of Sri Lanka, scheduled to begin in June, would only go ahead if the pandemic eases.
 "The safety and health of our cricketers is paramount and any shred of doubt, we will not shy away from calling it off."
 He said The BCCI leadership was in constant discussions with the International Cricket Council about restarting competitive cricket.
 Doubts remain over the Twenty20 World Cup beginning in October in Australia and India's four-Test, three-ODI tour afterwards.
 Dhumal has been quoted as saying that Indian players would be ready to go into a two-week quarantine before the tour. But he told AFP this would only apply if the World Cup were cancelled.
 "In case we are already there for the T20 World Cup then there is no question of quarantine because we will already have been there for a month or so," he said.
 "Cricket Australia are also not in a position to come up with something concrete. A lot will depend on the government and the travel bans in place. Let's see how they go about it."

Career intelligence and criminal justice officials were stunned by the Flynn decision, calling it an unprecedented abandonment of a successful prosecution. But it's hardly a surprise, given what Trump and Barr have done already.
 This Administration has worked to lighten punishments, pardon, or drop cases against almost every person accused of crimes related to Trump's election, and has persecuted and harried almost every prominent official -- including career government employees -- who has participated in investigations of Trump.
 The president has turned the Department of Justice into his personal law enforcement agency, politicized prosecutorial decisions that used to be nonpartisan, and allowed his friends and allies to commit crimes that others wouldn't be allowed to.
 These are textbook examples of the corrupt administration of justice. And they're putting the United States well down the road toward the corrupt authoritarian cronyism we've long decried in other countries.

However, Seifert says while they are taking every reasonable step to discourage fans from meeting up, "the DFL's responsibility ends at a certain point".
 The centrepiece of Saturday's return to action is Borussia Dortmund at home to Schalke in the Ruhr derby, a match which would usually draw a crowd of 82,000 to Signal Iduna Park.
 Instead, it will be the first time this fixture is played behind closed doors since it began in 1925.
 Germany's huge stadiums - for example Bayern Munich's enormous Allianz Arena holds 75,000 - will remain empty for the forseeable future.
 There are fears in the German football scene that the 'Ultras' -- hardcore fans who often lead the chanting at matches -- will lose their hard-earned influence at their clubs.
 Some groups of these hardcore supporters are opposed to games being played in empty stadiums, because they feel the initiative is driven by financial reasons.
 The clubs are eager to finish the league season before June 30 in order to collect around 300 million euros ($324 million) due from TV contracts.
 Helen Breit from the nationwide football supporters group "Unsere Kurve" (Our Curve) said she refused to watch a single match without fans on television.
 "For me, football is in the stadiums," she told Munich-based paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
 "I've been going to almost every Freiburg match for more than ten years and watching football on TV is not an option for me."

Some economists, moreover, believe that we've already experienced the worst of the impact of the pandemic and that the economy will improve from here.
 Second, the government's fast, aggressive financial response to the crisis -- in the form of emergency aid packages from the Treasury and Congress and emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve -- has significantly limited the potential economic damage.
 The government aid packages haven't saved all jobs (by a long shot), and they won't save all US businesses, but they've helped save a lot.
 In fact, one of Wall Street's best economists, Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, estimates that the various forms of government aid -- including enhanced unemployment benefits -- will actually more than offset the income Americans have collectively lost this year. This aid will not be shared equally, so there will still be plenty of individual pain, but, in aggregate, a lot of the economy's consumer spending should be maintained.

The fight in the tropics was staged in the daytime to suit US television audiences, but the crowd and TV lights overwhelmed the air-conditioning.
 "At 125 degrees -- we were fighting each other (as well as) against the heat," Frazier said in the 2008 documentary "Thrilla in Manila".
 Ali's blows had swollen Frazier's right eye nearly shut, and he was nearly blind in his left due to a training injury.
 His face soaked in blood, Frazier argued with his trainer Eddie Futch to let him come out for the 15th round, but Futch stopped the fight.
 Later, it was revealed that Ali himself wanted to quit.
 His biographer Thomas Hauser told the 2008 documentary that at the end of the round an Ali cornerman heard the champion telling trainer Angelo Dundee to "cut 'em (gloves) off".
 "Round 14 was the closest I've seen somebody come to killing somebody," Ali's fight doctor Ferdie Pacheco told the documentary makers.
 But after the Thrilla, "both men were never the same again", said Nick Giongco, a sports analyst at the Manila Bulletin.
 He said that although Ali would defend his world title a further six times, and regain it in a rematch after losing to Leon Spinks in 1978, the self- styled "Greatest of All Time" never fully recovered from the "brutal beatdown" Frazier had inflicted.
 Ali would finally hang up his gloves in 1981 aged 39, following consecutive losses to Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick. He retired with a win-loss record of 56-5.
 The "Louisville Lip" died nearly four years ago after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.
 "Smokin' Joe" (32-4-1) fought only twice more after the Manila epic, being stopped by Foreman for a second time in 1976 before coming out of retirement five years later to draw with the unheralded Floyd Cummings over 10 rounds. Frazier died in 2011.

Wolves are the first club to undergo the procedure. The nose and mouth swabs were performed by Premier League-appointed medics at a drive-through station in the club‚Äôs training ground in Compton, with the specimens delivered to a laboratory in London for analysis. The results will be sent to Wolves‚Äô doctor Matt Perry, who served as a medical adviser to the Premier League for four years before Wolves‚Äô promotion in 2018. The plan is to test players later this week and at regular intervals thereafter.

Given our current dearth of basketball, the inaugural tournament is almost certain to be a great financial success, and could prove even greater down the road should viewers prove as receptive as they were of the new All-Star format. Long-term, it would also give lesser teams without a shot at the traditional postseason something to play for, and fans of those teams something to look forward to other than ping pong balls. Even if it flopped, Silver and co. could easily spin it into a net-positive by donating the proceeds to coronavirus relief or research.

Formerly closed or takeout-only restaurants may have more to consider than just masks and gloves to keep customers safe, as states begin to lift coronavirus lockdowns. A group of researchers say that the air flow inside a restaurant is critical to reducing the chances of transmitting COVID-19, and that virus particles caught up in a room's air circulation can spread farther than the precautionary six-foot social distancing guideline.
 "When a virus is caught up in an air stream, it has the potential to move much further than six feet," Professor Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg told CBS News' Omar Villafranca.
 Wymelenberg and five other researchers from the University of Oregon and the University of California, Davis have written a paper focused on minimizing viral transmission in buildings.
 They first created a 3D model of how the virus could spread through a room with no open windows, and only an air conditioner or a fan to circulate the air.
 "The visualization is really trying to articulate how the particles get caught up in the air and move around the space," Wymelenberg explained.
 In a second 3D model, the same room was recreated -- only with an open window.
 "What we were seeing is that, with increased outdoor air exchange, through the open window‚Ä¶ particles deposit more quickly and then also be exhausted from the airstream more quickly," he said.
 In the end, fresh air led to fewer infections.
 Moving forward, Wymelenberg said buildings' air systems would be part of the conversation on how to keep people safe from COVID-19 and other viruses.
 "I think we're all going to be considering our air systems in buildings much more seriously moving forward," he said. "And I think restauranteurs will be included in that scenario."
 Julian Eelsen, who owns Whisk Crepes Cafe in Dallas, agrees that current social distancing and PPE guidelines are not enough to keep customers safe yet.
 Despite Texas allowing restaurants to open at 25% capacity, Eelsen is not ready to let customers inside his 25-person seating establishment.
 "We don't even let them order inside. They have to order, like, outside on the phone or online. Nobody comes inside besides employees," Eelsen said.
 He said the decision was not only for the peace of mind of him and his staff, but for his customers as well -- to which they have been receptive.
 "A lot of customers give us some very positive feedback," he said about electing to not reopen for dining.

‚ÄúWe do see rugby coming back this year,‚Äù Dermot Rigley, the PRO14's commercial director, told Sport for Business. ‚ÄúWe are working with the chief medical officers across each union, World Rugby, and working with the health authorities in every territory to make sure we get this right.
 ‚ÄúThe Irish government gave a date of 10th of August. We are working with them on when the elite game actually comes back. We are waiting on that. We do see a return to play but how that looks is the million-dollar question.
 ‚ÄúSocial distancing, as long as that is as strict as it is now, obviously plays on how many get into a stadium, and we are working on that, but we all know this is a game, I suppose, of snakes and ladders.
 ‚ÄúWe want to make sure we do things at the right time and as safe as possible for all involved. We want to make progress and, being in the business of major events, we don‚Äôt want to have that down-the-snake potential by going too early.‚Äù
 Rigley recognised the competition's ‚Äúunique position‚Äù given the participation of sides based in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy, and South Africa. The league has been on pause since March 12th and the final, due in Cardiff, has been cancelled.
 ‚ÄúWe all want to get it back but we want to get it right,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThat could be a combination of initially behind closed doors, limited crowds, but definitely we want to see rugby back this year, and that means finishing off this season and then starting next season as well, but there are a lot of moving parts here.
 ‚ÄúThe great thing is we have the benefit of time now. It‚Äôs still early May and in each territory, it is going quite well from the medical side. In Italy, it‚Äôs going quite well in Ireland, and the UK are getting a handle on it as well, and South Africa a little bit different. We should have a better idea of that in the next few weeks but definitely rugby in 2020 is our ambition.‚Äù
