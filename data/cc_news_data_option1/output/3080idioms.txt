WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Three men have been rescued from a tiny Pacific island after writing a giant SOS sign in the sand that was spotted from above, authorities say.
   
 The men had been missing in the Micronesia archipelago for nearly three days when their distress signal was spotted Sunday on uninhabited Pikelot Island by searchers on Australian and U.S. aircraft, the Australian defense department said Monday.
   
 The men had apparently set out from Pulawat atoll in a 7-meter (23-foot) boat on July 30 and had intended to travel about 43 kilometers (27 miles) to Pulap atoll when they sailed off course and ran out of fuel, the department said.
   
 Searchers in Guam asked for Australian help. The military ship, Canberra, which was returning to Australia from exercises in Hawaii, diverted to the area and joined forces with U.S. searchers from Guam.
   
 The men were found about 190 kilometers (118 miles) from where they had set out.
   
 "I am proud of the response and professionalism of all on board as we fulfill our obligation to contribute to the safety of life at sea wherever we are in the world," said the Canberra's commanding officer, Capt. Terry Morrison, in a statement.
   
 The men were found in good condition, and an Australian military helicopter was able to land on the beach and give them food and water. A Micronesian patrol vessel was due to pick them up.
   
 SOS is an internationally recognized distress signal that originates from Morse code.

And that's a good-margin business, and that was helpful in the quarter as well, but we almost got back to last year's levels effectively in two months versus having three months, because April was pretty much not very active. So, again, that team executed extraordinarily well to do what they did in two months relative to last year what's done in three months. We feel really good about that and I think the demand is still there going forward, probably not the pace that we saw in the last couple of months, but it's still pretty steady.

ENGLAND - Video-sharing app TikTok has updated its content policies to curb misinformation on its platform ahead of the presidential election in the United States, the company said on Wednesday.
 The app, which has come under fire by US lawmakers and the Trump administration over national security concerns due to its Chinese ownership, said it was working with experts from the US Department of Homeland Security to "protect against foreign influence".
 TikTok said it would expand partnerships with PolitiFact and Lead Stories to fact-check potential misinformation about the election. It will also allow users to report vote-related misinformation on the app, the company said in a blog post.
 The company, which does not allow political advertising and said in the blog post it was not the “go-to app to follow news or politics,” has increasingly emerged as a platform for political discourse and activism. Users recently said they helped inflate attendance expectations at US President Donald Trump’s June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
 The hugely popular app, which allows users to create short videos with special effects and music clips, has also been used to share false claims such as COVID-19 misinformation.
 TikTok said it was adding a specific policy to prohibit synthetic or manipulated content that misleads users in a way that could cause harm. In recent days, a viral doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had spread across social media platforms, including TikTok.
 The changes are the latest moves by TikTok to combat misinformation, an issue that major social media companies including Facebook and Twitter have long struggled to police on their own platforms.
 TikTok owner ByteDance is the first Chinese company to achieve global success with a consumer app.
 However, amid rising U.S.-China tensions, the White House has threatened to ban TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps, citing national security risks.
 TikTok currently faces a deadline of 15 September to either sell its US operations to Microsoft Corp or face an outright ban.

 Chelsea had a buy-back clause in the deal that sold Ake to Bournemouth in 2017 but sources told ESPN they were not interested in a deal to re-sign their former player.
 The 25-year-old made 121 appearances for Bournemouth after moving from Chelsea, initially on loan, in 2016. He has won 13 caps for the Netherlands.
 Ake's arrival will add further doubts about the futures of Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones. The pair fell behind Eric Garcia in the pecking order once the Premier League restarted amid the coronavirus pandemic and have been linked with moves away from the Etihad Stadium.
 Sources have told ESPN that director of football Txiki Begiristain is open to adding another central defender following Ake's arrival. Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly, Villarreal's Pau Torres and Benfica's Ruben Dias are among the names in the frame.

He's a bit of a mystery man. He was taken in the 2019 draft, a third-round pick out of West Virginia, but no one saw the tackle play in Foxborough thanks to offseason surgery on his quad. He didn't participate in camp, and was put on injured reserve. So what's known? Former offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia liked him and had positive things to say about the rookie last year. Given that, Cajuste was expected to be in the running for the swing tackle job behind Isaiah Wynn and Cannon. With Cannon opting out – there's a starting job waiting for him if he wants to grab it. Korey Cunningham and rookie Justin Herron are also in the mix, but if Cajuste shows whatever ability inspired the Patriots to take him early in the draft, it wouldn't be surprising for him to assume Cannon's role on the right side. Obviously, he's raw when it comes to NFL experience, but his upside exceeds the other candidates. While his injury history is a concern, he has the size (6-foot-5, 310 pounds), strength and ability to move into Cannon's spot. It's up to him to take advantage.

No, instead, we should chase the next Ekeler. This is the basis for the high- value touch (HVT) and TRAP stats I introduced last summer and have written about for much of the past year. High-value touches constitute all receptions anywhere on the field plus all touches inside the 10-yard line, which I will refer to as the green zone. About a quarter of all RB touches come from these two groups, but they account for nearly 60% of RB Fantasy points.
 Ekeler's 103 HVT in 2019 made him the only back other than Christian McCaffrey to total at least 100 of those touches. And that was predictable in his range of outcomes, largely because of his offense. The Chargers consistently generated plenty of HVT for their backs, which explained Ekeler's massive upside when Melvin Gordon held out and is the chief reason I compared him to Alvin Kamara after Gordon had returned in-season. A major basis of that comparison, which seemed to fly against the grain of how significant of an impact Gordon's return would have on Ekeler's value, was the similarity between the Chargers and Saints in terms of consistently lofty HVT production for their entire backfields.
 I'm not trying to toot my own horn here as much as I'm trying to emphasize thinking in this way leads to actionable conclusions about RB upside before the market, and utilizing this stat I introduced last offseason served me well in my own leagues.

When the Arizona Cardinals hired Kliff Kingsbury in 2019, the jokes made themselves with his connection to Sean McVay. At the time, it appeared any coach who came in contact with McVay was getting hired, especially Kingsbury, who was famously listed in the press release of his hire as being "friends with Rams coach Sean McVay."
 It didn't help matters that Kingsbury finished with a 35-40 record in college, raising questions about whether he belonged in the NFL. In what was expected to be a brutal first season in Arizona, Kingsbury left a lasting impression on the league.
 The Cardinals offense jumped from last in points scored in 2018 to 16th in 2019 and from last in total yards to 21st. Kyler Murray won NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year as Arizona went from a laughing stock to one of rising young teams in the league. Kingsbury put his own wrinkle in innovating the NFL, running 10 personnel (four wide receiver sets) on a league-high 31% of the offense's snaps after the Cardinals only went four-wide _once_ the previous year (per Sharp Football Stats).
 But don't expect that reliance on four-wide sets to necessarily continue in 2020.
 "I'll always love 10 personnel, but we felt like as the season went on, we were able to do some different things and be in some different packages that played into our strengths," Kingsbury said, via the Cardinals website. "I felt like in the back half of last year, we figured out what our identity is, who we can be, the different things we can do.

GENEVA - The World Health Organisation (WHO) said Wednesday it was "unrealistic" to expect large crowds at sports events this year in countries suffering from community-level transmission of the new coronavirus.
 WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said it could be "disastrous" in such circumstances to allow the return of sports matches with tens of thousands of people attending.
 Asked in a live WHO social media chat when major sports events could come back, Ryan said it was impossible to predict.
 "We don't know," the Irish epidemiologist said.
 "Large crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people - it's not just the risk of being in the stadium, it's the risk of going to the stadium, the public transport, the bars and the clubs," he explained.
 "Imagine all the problems we have now with nightclubs and bars, and you squeeze all of that together into a four- or five-hour experience, where thousands of people go on the same public transport to a venue, get involved in the social aspects before a game, be involved in the game and then all of the social aspects after.
 "In the context of community transmission, that could be disastrous."
 The Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the 2020 European football championships have been postponed until next year, while major football tournaments like Europe's Champions League and the English Premier League have been forced behind closed doors.
 "We may have to expect that as things open up, we go from having no-one at the games to maybe 1,000 and 2,000," said Ryan.
 "We all want our sport back. We're just going to have to be careful for a good bit longer.
 "It's very unrealistic in countries with community transmission that we're going to be seeing large gatherings like that this year.
 "Right now, it's hard to see those fully re-opened venues."

The Patriots have a few safety options to plug the vacancy created by Chung opting out. Adrian Phillips, signed in free agency, fits the bill. Terrance Brooks, who filled in for Chung at times last season, might also be in the mix. Dugger? With Chung, Phillips and Brooks all having the ability to play closer to the box, it was hard envisioning how Dugger, the team's 2020 second- round pick, might get on the field. Without Chung, and also Duron Harmon, who was traded in the offseason, there's more of an opening for him to get on the field. Dugger, a Division II prospect from Lenoir-Rhyne, has the versatility to play closer to the line, or deep like Devin McCourty and Harmon. The defense is complex; Dugger needs to be a quick study. His athleticism makes him a viable option to assume one of the safety roles. With his ability to return punts, Dugger could see playing time a lot more than expected.

Edward Jones is now asking a federal judge in Virginia to grant an injunction barring Clyburn from talking further with those clients. The firm is also pursuing a separate FINRA arbitration case against the advisor.
 In May, Edward Jones _sued a Missouri-based former advisor_ after he defected to LPL. In late 2018, Edward Jones sued two of its ex-advisors, who had also moved to Ameriprise, over alleged violations of non-solicitation agreements.
 St. Louis-based Edward Jones has more than 17,000 advisors. It is not a member of the Broker Protocol, an industry agreement that permits advisors switching employers to take basic client contact information with them.
 The firm’s lawsuit alleges that Clyburn, who had worked at Edward Jones for 10 years before joining Ameriprise, signed an employment agreement that included a one-year non-solicitation clause. Edward Jones claims Clyburn copied client contact information and took it with him to his new employer in violation of his employment agreements.
 The firm further charges that Ameriprise “instructs incoming recruits to compile client information from their former firm and input it onto a thumb drive, some other storage device, or into a third-party, cloud-based system.”
 Edward Jones claims Ameriprise and Clyburn utilized this same strategy, thereby jeopardizing the firm’s business in Wytheville.
 “Client information including names, addresses, investment holdings and other financial information are confidential trade secrets, as defined by the agreement and by law, and the exclusive property of Edward Jones,” the firm’s lawsuit says.

THERE is much discontent with the way in which school assessments have been carried out in this peculiar year. Normally, these would have concluded with examinations, but this year coursework and teacher assessments are what has counted - until the SQA intervened. It is unfortunate that Scottish youngsters do not have the same opportunity as those in England will have to demonstrate their ability in exams. For decades, there has been criticism of exams, while "continuous assessment" has been favoured. It is true that exams are a throw of the dice on a specific day when some candidates may be out of sorts for one reason or another. Yet continuous assessment puts pressure on them over a lengthy period, and puts pressure on markers to give good grades because the coursework counts towards the final grade. This allows little room for getting it wrong first time and then learning from that.

MADISON, Ind.

He argued he was a caring parent while under the influence of meth, subutex, and heroin.Keller was arrested back in June of 2019 after an investigation by the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office. The mother of the toddler called the Department of Child Services. During the investigation, the sheriff’s office obtained a tape containing more than 100 videos of Keller abusing the child. Court records indicate the videos show the man forcing the child’s head into the couch, placing much of his body weight on the child and suffocating him for 40 seconds. The child can be seen writhing, attempting to breathe. Other videos show hitting, kicking, or tackling the child. Videos show him dragging the child across the couch by his hair, even holding him upside down by holding one leg, causing his head to hit the floor violently multiple times, prosecutors said.He was sentenced in December of 2019.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

The Ellis County committee handing out a windfall of $5.74 million in federal COVID-19 aid to the county has received 106 applications for the money.
   
 Applications for direct aid totaled more than $1.4 billion, according to Ellis County administrator J.D. Cox, who presented the numbers at the regular meeting of the Ellis County Commission on Monday evening.
   
 "Say that again," said County Commissioner Dean Haselhorst, when Cox announced the amount.
   
 "1 billion, with a b," Cox said.
   
 "That's what I thought you said," Haselhorst said.
   
 "Now if we throw out the ones that are probably ineligible, that brings us down to $8,267,494," Cox said.
   
 The deadline for applications was noon Monday.
   
 The county's plan for spending the money is due to the state of Kansas by Aug. 15. The final day for amendments is Sept. 15.
   
 The federal money, which is being funneled to counties through the state, must be spent before Dec. 30.
   
 "I was actually concerned we wouldn't have enough requests," said County Commissioner Dustin Roths. "We've blown past that, so now we have to tell some people 'no.' "
   
 The county commissioners will make the final decision as to who gets the money. They are set to meet at 8 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 13 to decide.
   
 A committee of 26 members assembled from the community by Cox are vetting the applications and will make recommendations to the commission.
   
 That group meets next at 9 a.m. Wednesday via Zoom to talk about the next steps in the process, Cox said.
   
 "The time frame is just incredibly short on this whole application process," he said.
   
 The applications break down into some broad categories, namely: $4.9 million in requests from business and for-profit entities; $1.2 million from nonprofits; $1.1 million for education; $547,000 for governmental needs; and $435,000 for public health and safety.
   
 "I think what needs to happen is some additional culling, that's what the group is going to take up," Cox said, suggesting the committee might get help from the county's economic development arm, Grow Hays, or another local entity that is versed in ranking applications for money.
   
 "They have an application form where they take a look at the impact on the community," Cox said of Grow Hays.
   
 Roths supported that notion, citing Grow Hays' experience with loan applications.
   
 "They've seen it and they know how to go through the process," he said. "I think they're well enough connected in the community that I think they'll do a wonderful job of getting the best bang for the buck."
   
 The goal of the state is to get the money pumped quickly into the local economy, Cox said.
   
 "Hopefully we'll move very quickly. When we came into this we were a little behind the other counties," he said. "But now we're caught up."
   
 Cox expects follow-up questions to some of the organizations that applied, noting there were wide variations in the applications and how much information they supplied to support their request.
   
 "Some of these are a $300,000 application, it might have two sentences in support of it," Cox said.
   
 The committee decided previously it will set aside $1 million of the money for unforeseen contingencies related to the COVID-19 outbreak.
   
 Some of the requests looked at for Round 1 could potentially be included in a Round 2, he said.
   
 A preliminary announcement from the state said Round 2 money won't go through the counties but directly to applicants for public health, economic development, connectivity and education, Cox said.
   
 "The state is encouraging us to go ahead and take care of the local needs now, where it could be controlled," Cox said. "And if folks are left out or come up short, then they can apply in Round 2."
   
 Besides Cox, members of the committee are Hays Medical Center president and CEO Eddie Herrman; Fort Hays State University president Tisa Mason; High Plains Mental Health Center executive director Walt Hill; Holy Family Elementary School principal Rachel Wentling; USD 489 superintendent Ron Wilson; Grow Hays executive director Doug Williams; Hays city manager Toby Dougherty; First Call for Help executive director Linda Mills; United Way of Ellis County executive director Erica Berges; Hays Area Chamber of Commerce director Sarah Wasinger; Developmental Services of Northwest Kansas president and CEO Jerry Michaud; county Extension agent Donna Krug; and Hays Convention and Visitors Bureau executive director Melissa Dixon.

When it comes to the career grand slam in golf, the names that are most often discussed are Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson. Those two have famously (infamously?) not completed the career slam. McIlroy because he shot a final round 80 at the 2011 Masters. Mickelson because he's lost U.S. Opens every feasible way you could lose U.S. Opens.
 They're trying to join Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Gene Sarazen and Tiger Woods on the list of golfers who have won all four major championships. Neither will have a shot this week, though both will have opportunities later this year.
 The player who _does_ have a shot this week, who we conversely almost never talk about when it comes to the career grand slam, is Jordan Spieth. The winner of the 2015 Masters, 2015 U.S. Open and 2017 Open Championship has put together a more subtle run because he's never really contended at a PGA Championship like McIlroy and Mickelson have at the majors that currently elude them.
 Nevertheless, history is still on the table this week at TPC Harding Park.
 Spieth actually had one of his best-ever PGA Championship performances last season at Bethpage Black. He was in the final pairing with Brooks Koepka on Saturday in Round 3 before sliding a bit to a T3 finish at the end of the week. He never _really_ contended because Koepka was lapping the field, but he at least got a taste. Spieth also finished solo second in 2015 when he was beaten by only four golfers at the four major championships.

Yeah, that's OK. The market has got a few things going on in, and one was a pandemic. So like in a lot of industries people pause to figure out what was going to happen here. You've got a very immature market to start with and you have a lot of small private companies that are in it. And as a result, in this pandemic hit, trying to understand, remember early on, most of these companies were not deemed essential. So everyone was circling the wagons to see make sure they preserve capital accordingly and then month or so later then they redeemed essential. So there is a lot of start staffing going on because of the pandemic. And you have a lot of small companies across the variety of states trying to work through it and each state is a little different in terms of what's essential and what's not. So that was very disruptive in the second quarter and I think people circling the wagons and said, let's batten down the hatches until we figure out the landscape here.

A Gaston County man said his 2018 conviction for driving while impaired was wrong. He claims that when police found him nonresponsive, slumped over in the driver's seat, his car was near his mobile home and not in a public area.
   
 However, the NC Court of Appeals said Superior Court Judge Todd Pomeroy was correct when he denied Ricky Franklin Charles' motion to dismiss due to insufficient evidence during his trial held in April 2018 in Gaston Superior Court.
   
 A jury later found Charles, 52, guilty of driving while impaired when police found him in his car on Wayne Lane, a gravel road leading to a trailer park in rural Gaston County between Lowell and North Belmont.
   
 Charles, who was represented by attorney Drew Nelson with The Epstein Law Firm in Raleigh in his appeal, argued that his motion to dismiss should have been granted based on insufficient evidence.
   
 After hearing the case in the Court of Appeals on March 14, 2019, a panel made up of Chief Judge Linda McGee and fellow judges Phillip Berger Jr. and Hunter Murphy concluded there was substantial evidence of DWI and that Wayne Lane was a road within or leading to a subdivision, thereby making it a public vehicular area.
   
 "We hold the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss," said the panel, which issued its finding in an Aug. 4 filing.
   
 A police detective testified that she responded to a call on April 9, 2016, and found Charles in his car, which was parked with the engine running, on Wayne Lane near its intersection with Pinhook Loop Road, which is off Linn Street and Hickory Grove Road.
   
 The detective said Charles was nonresponsive and was slumped over in the driver's seat with his head down and his eyes closed. He was taken to jail and a blood test later showed Alprazolam, Oxycodone and Oxymorphone in his system. The officer testified that Charles also admitted to taking powerful prescription painkillers regularly. In the detective's opinion, Charles' impairment stemmed from his prescription medication.
   
 Police and prosecutors argued that Wayne Lane was a public street with two mobile homes, including one occupied by Charles, along the gravel road. There were also approximately six mobile homes along Hyatt Drive, which forks off Wayne Lane.
   
 A neighbor who discovered Charles in his car testified that his car was on a "little road, gravel drive road" that led to a "trailer park."
   
 In his appeal, Charles argued Wayne Lane was not within or leading to a "subdivision" because only two mobile homes are located there. Prosecutors argued the road was within a subdivision because it provided vehicular access to the two mobile homes as well as the six additional mobile homes off of Hyatt Drive.

WRITE &nbspTO; &nbspUS;!  Send a letter to the editor to the Daily News by following this link or the News Herald by following this link .  
 I am responding to Mr. Reid's article "Quit acting contrary to the facts" appearing in the News Herald's Viewpoints page, on July 25, 2020. It appears that Mr. Reid is trying to chastise the Beach City Council for passing a mask ordinance, in an effort to slow down the spread of the coronavirus, without following the Science.
   
 The Council did indeed follow the current scientific facts. He claims that their policy is based on "a random doctor or waiter comments or fears." This statement is ridiculous. I am sure Dr. Fauci, and the thousands of doctors and nurses that are putting their lives on the line every day while taking care of Covid-19 patients, appreciate being referred to as some random doctor.
   
 At the start of the epidemic, Dr. Fauci and others did not recommend the wearing of mask by the general public, since it provides only minimal protection for the individual wearing the mask. However, as the epidemic progressed, it was observed that wearing masks slowed the transmission of the virus.
   
 Researchers have found that infected individuals, without a mask, can project droplets from 8 to 13 feet. These individuals may be asymptomatic and not realize they are carrying the virus. For this reason, experts are saying that wearing a mask is more for protecting other individuals than yourself.
   
 A research group at Texas A&M; has preliminary results which indicate that early social distancing and sanitization measures "minimized short-range contact transmission." But once masking was implemented, more than 60,000 lives were saved in New York and more than 70,000 in Italy (and counting). Their work again emphasizes "airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of Covid-19" and mask use "the most effective means to prevent inter-human transmission.
   
 I wish to thank Wal-Mart, Publix, Sam's, and all the other stores that are now requiring masks to shop at their stores. Also, I wish to thank all the people that I have seen wearing masks and trying to do the right thing.
   
 I don't like having to wear a mask. However, I feel it is a small price to pay in order to help minimize spreading of this virus.
   
 Finally, I would like to express my disappointment in the News Herald for placing this article in the area of the "Viewpoints" page, that is usually reserved for their opinion. This article was presented with no qualifying remarks like "another view" as they did with a recent article from the Daytona Beach News-Journal, which proposed a state-wide mandate for wearing masks in public.
   
 The lack of a qualifying statement leads me, and I'm sure others too, to believe that the News Herald supports Mr. Reid's views on not wearing a mask. Articles, like this one, does nothing to help slow down the rising number of deaths from this deadly disease until a vaccine is available.
   
 It is a feeble attempt to provide an excuse for those who wish to continue not wearing masks.

From Edina, Minnesota, Bowlby, had 21 goals and 45 points in 84 games in three seasons, and received the ECAC Hockey Commissioner's award in having the team's highest GPA last year.

I think I know one thing I can say that everyone in Gastonia will agree upon and that is this, 2020 has been one heck of a year and 2021 cannot arrive soon enough.
   
 For me it started with the death of my father on Jan. 3. And was followed by a global pandemic, economic uncertainty, civil unrest and a community in turmoil. In times like these I go back to my roots and I am reminded of the hymns of my childhood that brought me peace and comfort.
   
 My absolute favorite is, "It is well with my soul,, by hymnist Horatio Spafford. The story of how this hymn came about is just as inspiring as the lyrics themself.
   
 Spafford, a once wealthy lawyer in Chicago with a son and four daughters, lost his 4-year-old boy and soon after much of his fortune due to the great Chicago fire.
   
 He then lost all four of his daughters in tragic circumstances at sea. Yet in the midst of all the grief and sorrow, Spafford penned the following words. These words are not only for those who sing this hymn in churches everywhere, but for every soul in Gastonia, North Carolina…
   
 When peace like a river, attendeth my way,
   
 When sorrows like sea billows roll;
   
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know
   
 It is well, it is well, with my soul.
   
 I know the last couple weeks of community divide, economic hardship and civil unrest on top of the restraints and exhaustion of COVID-19 have led many of us to be in need of peace like a river.
   
 And as if those challenges were not already heavy enough for our Gastonia, we saw the hurt and pain of a community grappling with its history as well as its future. Nobody should feel left out or unwelcome or unheard. And for that we all have work to do.
   
 It is my hope and sincere prayer that as our County Commissioners begin the process of dealing with the Confederate monument that our community will begin to put the pieces back together.
   
 Perhaps not hurriedly, but deliberately as to take time to listen and to understand one another. I also pray that the better angels take flight and we exercise patience and peace with one another.
   
 And further it is my desire to see our diverse people of all colors, creeds, backgrounds, sexualities and cultures take one step forward in agreeing that Gastonia has a bright future ahead of us if we can communicate with one another and appreciate our differences.
   
 I know as a City Council member I look forward to being a part of the solution and a part of the process with you.
   
 It will not be easy to begin the healing process. It will take courage on all of our part. Not just our faith community or public servants or business community; but all of us in every neighborhood and on every street in this city.
   
 We have overcome much in our past and if we want to put in the work that comes with true unification we can have a wonderful future.
   
 It is now time to rise up and begin the journey of reconciliation. As the cries for grace and mercy and justice and redemption begin to flow, let us listen with our hearts and understand with our souls.
   
 Let the tough conversations begin. Let us set aside all that keeps us from seeing clearly and acting with empathy and compassion. Let us cast off judgment and scorn and may we take up together in saying…
   
 It is well, it is well with my soul.

Facebook has a long tradition of cloning competitive services. The Instagram “Story” feature, which lets people share photos and videos that expire in 24 hours, is similar to Snapchat. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced tough questioning about the company’s habit of copying rivals before a congressional hearing on July 29.
 Facebook earlier launched a TikTok knockoff called Lasso in 2018, but closed that down in July. It also tried services similar to Snapchat called Slingshot and Poke before Instagram Stories caught on. But those were separate apps — it might have more success with a feature built into Instagram.
 In fact, copying Snapchat’s features was successful for Instagram in part because Snapchat was difficult to figure out for new users. They were already comfortable with Instagram. But TikTok is very easy to use \-- easier than Instagram -- and part of its appeal is that you’re able to sit back and scroll endlessly with just swipes, without the need to follow anyone or post anything.
 For Reels to succeed, Facebook will have to lure video creators away from TikTok. This might be easier to do with Reels since many creators are already on Instagram. In response to published reports that Instagram is paying TikTok influencers to join Reels, Instagram said in a statement that the company “have a long history of reaching out to emerging creators and working to break new stars on Instagram.”
 “As with previous products, we remain committed to investing in both our creators and their overall experience, and in certain cases, we may help cover production costs for their creative ideas,” the company said.
 TikTok, in turn, launched a $200 million “creator fund” in July that it says will grow to over $1 billion in the U.S. in the next three years and more than double that globally, to pay video creators for their material.
 TikTok, however, is under fire, possibly opening an opportunity for Facebook.
 Microsoft is in talks to buy part of TikTok in what would be a forced sale, following threats from President Donald Trump to ban the Chinese-owned video app, which claims 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.
 Since early July, TikTok users have been posting videos urging viewers to follow them to other platforms like Instagram, reflecting the threat of a TikTok ban. Mary Keane-Dawson, Group CEO at influencer marketing agency Takumi, said the influencers she works with have been sad, angry and upset about the threat of a ban. Still, they’re “pragmatic,” she said, and the smart ones were already active on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.
 Reels is debuting in over 50 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Australia and others, as well as officially launching in the test countries — Brazil, France, Germany and India.
 Instagram has more than a billion users worldwide. TikTok says it has 100 million users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally.

The number of new COVID-19 cases is surging in Sawyer County.
 In just one week, from Wednesday, June 29, to Tuesday, Aug. 4, a total of 18 new positive COVID-19 cases had been identified in Sawyer County. And then on Wednesday, Aug. 5 the number rose another 7, to a total of 51 positives since the pandemic began.
 These new positives represent nearly a three-fold increase from the previous week when seven positives were reported between July 23 and July 28. In total, 44 positives had been identified by Tuesday morning, up from 26 just one week before.
 Sawyer County Public Health Officer Julia Lyons said the number of positives is “ramping up” and she expects it to continue to expand in the coming weeks.
 “We are definitely in a surge,” she said. “We needed that masking order. (Gov. Tony Evers’ emergency order requiring face covering issued July 30). We needed that so other counties would be on the same page with us to control the spread.”
 Lyons said she is confident the county will be considered by the state as a “high” activity county for COVID-19 based on the number of new positives.
 “We’ve received way too many positives in too short amount of time,” she said. “We haven’t had a day in the last week or so when we haven’t had a report of at least one positive.”
 Lyons said 50% of the new cases have been attributed to contact with another positive COVID-19, but for the other 50% her office had not been able to discern how the people were infected.
 “It’s in our community and it’s not just coming from the outside, from tourism,” she said.
 She said there is at least one site that was visited by two or more individuals who have tested positive. But Lyons said she couldn’t determine if the positives had contracted the virus in the same building or outside it because they all had social contact with one another outside the facility.
 Lyons said she would issue a press release with more information about the site later this week, but noted the person managing the facility already had notified those who had been in the building and might have been exposed.
 On Tuesday morning, Lyons told the Record that 24 of the 44 people who tested positive have recovered. Three of the 44 have been hospitalized. A total of 2,627 people in the county have tested negative.

_All Distortions Are Intentional_ , the Wrexham collective’s fourth album, is a forty-minute romp through Sonderland, the title-track and fictional setting of the record. Conceptual in nature, and telling the story of protagonists Jett and Alice’s love, the album is certainly fun, and undeniably a great listen. It’s hardly a surprise that one of the most popular pop punk groups of the 2010s is capable of making a great pop punk album, and _All Distortions Are Intentional_ is certainly that. The opening four tracks; ‘Sonderland’, ‘Fall’, ‘Lowlife’, and the immensely catchy ‘Telling Stories’ are a closed- fist opening barrage of punky riffs and hooks kept suitably poppy by the upbeat vocals of Ben Barlow. Similarly, the final three tracks are a glorious crescendo. ‘Little Dove’ is a beautiful song, slow and immensely singable, much like fan favourites ‘December’ and ‘Wish You Were Here’ from prior albums. ‘I Revolve (Around You)’ is a fantastic skate-park banger, and one of the songs I imagine will work wonderfully for the pit when Neck Deep can return to touring, and ‘Pushing Daisies’, the closing track, is by far and away the best on the album, truly ending _All Distortions Are Intentional_ with a cathartic middle finger to the world.

Marqise Lee, coming off two major injuries, wasn't exactly a lock to make the team. But the element of having speed at receiver can't be overlooked. Damiere Byrd might benefit most by not having to duke it out with Lee for that role, but let's not overlook Thomas. He's a real sleeper who could make some noise with Lee out of the equation. Yes, he comes with baggage, having been kicked off the Miami Hurricanes once, but his raw ability can't be overlooked. Even at 5-foot-8, he has the possibility of making it in the NFL thanks to his blazing speed (4.45 time in the 40-yard dash) and natural talent. He could be utilized in any number of ways, be it outside, in the slot, or on end-arounds. Add his special teams ability as a returner, and the former four-star recruit is an intriguing prospect. With spots available, he's one player who could surprise and seize the opportunity. He reportedly loves to play the game, but isn't a fan of all the work that goes along with it. If he's committed and dedicated, it will be hard to send him packing.

ST. LOUIS -- St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, whose job performance has been lauded by some civil rights activists and criticized by President Donald Trump and other leading Republicans, held off a challenge from a former homicide prosecutor in Tuesday's primary election.
   
 Gardner, 44, defeated Mary Pat Carl in the Democratic primary. She'll be heavily favored in November against Republican Daniel Zdrodowski since St. Louis voters are overwhelmingly Democratic.
   
 Gardner has shaken up the St. Louis criminal justice establishment since she was elected in 2016, becoming the city's first Black circuit attorney. She initiated reforms that have included using diversion programs instead of incarceration, stopped prosecuting low-level marijuana crimes and drew the ire of police leaders when she developed an "exclusion list" of officers who can't serve as primary witnesses because of unspecified credibility concerns.
   
 But it was her decision to file charges in two high-profile cases that drew the scorn of conservatives.
   
 In 2018, Gardner charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, with felony invasion of privacy. The charge accused Greitens of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair and threatening to post it if she spoke of their relationship.
   
 Greitens admitted to the affair but denied that he committed a crime. The charge was later dropped. But Greitens, who also was facing unrelated ethics complaints, resigned in June 2018.
   
 Gardner again received national attention last month when she charged a white couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, with felony unlawful use of a weapon for displaying guns when protesters marched near their home.
   
 Several hundred demonstrators were marching to the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson on June 28 when they veered onto a private street where the McCloskeys lived. He came out with a semi-automatic rifle and she had a semi-automatic handgun, according to a probable cause statement.
   
 Gardner said the display of weapons during an otherwise peaceful protest risked bloodshed. The McCloskeys said they felt threatened.
   
 Trump was critical of Gardner on Twitter and in interviews. Republican Gov. Mike Parson said he'll likely pardon the couple if they're convicted. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri asked the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an investigation of Gardner. Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt asked a judge to throw out the charges.
   
 St. Louis has one of the nation's highest murder rates, and homicides are up again this year. Critics have accused Gardner of wasting time and money on high-profile cases rather than doing more to put killers behind bars.
   
 Despite the criticism, Gardner has had plenty of support, too. The city's Black community in particular has lauded her reforms and her willingness to take on police, who they believe have, for years, unfairly targeted Black residents.
   
 Gardner has long contended she's the victim of race-based attacks. In January, she filed a federal lawsuit accusing the city government, along with the biggest police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit also accused "entrenched interests" of intentionally impeding her efforts to change racist practices.
   
 Carl, 43, also lost to Gardner in the 2016 Democratic primary. She was the city's lead homicide prosecutor at the time, and continued in that role for the first 10 months of Gardner's tenure before resigning. She had pledged a stronger focus on violent crime.

Wells Fargo continues to struggle with _advisor attrition_. Despite heavy recruiting, the number of its advisors _fell to 13,298 for the second quarter from 13,799 for the year-ago period_. Net income in wealth management fell 70% during the same time period. Companywide the bank also lost $2.4 billion in the second quarter.
 After searching for a new independent broker-dealer for a year, the Uinta team decided on Raymond James for its client-centric culture and technology offerings, according to Williams.
 He calls the change “refreshing.”
 “Raymond James has a culture of doing what’s right for clients and ensuring advisors have the freedom to run their practice,” Williams said in a statement.
 That Raymond James is not heavily engaged in “a lot of financial engineering” also appealed to the advisors.
 “They are not big into investment banking,” Williams says. “They are not behind the scenes creating financial products that are complicated.”
 Earlier in his career, Williams was a financial advisor at Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley. Smith, Farr and Thornton also are Morgan Stanley veterans. Wittusen previously worked for Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Holtman earlier worked for Soltis Investment Advisors and Presidio Wealth Management. Farr is co-founder of Uinta.
 The team includes office manager and registered client services associate Jana Berry, and client service associate, Kristin Craddock.
 In terms of reputational risk, Williams thinks Uinta has landed at the right place
 “Nobody’s perfect,” he says. “But the kind of business that Raymond James does isn’t going to get them in trouble.”

While it's certainly possible for the Patriots to add a veteran tight end room in wake of LaCosse opting out, Asiasi and Keene could help the cause. The offense could definitely use a boost from the position, and it sure looks like it's going to be a trial by fire for the rookie duo. Asiasi, in particular, has the skill set and ability to step into a top role. He just has to accelerate the learning curve. Whether a veteran is brought in or not, the opportunity is there for Asiasi to jump in and establish himself as a difference-maker. Ryan Izzo, the team's 2018 seventh-round pick, is the only tight end with NFL experience. He's primarily a blocking tight end, so Asiasi could step in immediately given his ability to block and catch passes. As for Keene, with his versatility, he could be an asset any number of ways. With fullback Vitale opting out, he can serve in that role, line up as an H-back, or a second tight end, and help diversify the offense. If the duo can perform beyond their experience, they'll make up for several losses.

 WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Three men have been rescued from a tiny Pacific island after writing a giant SOS sign in the sand that was spotted from above, authorities say.
 The men had been missing in the Micronesia archipelago for nearly three days when their distress signal was spotted Sunday on uninhabited Pikelot Island by searchers on Australian and U.S. aircraft, the Australian defense department said Monday.
 The men had apparently set out from Pulawat atoll in a 7-meter (23-foot) boat on July 30 and had intended to travel about 43 kilometers (27 miles) to Pulap atoll when they sailed off course and ran out of fuel, the department said.
 Searchers in Guam asked for Australian help. The military ship, Canberra, which was returning to Australia from exercises in Hawaii, diverted to the area and joined forces with U.S. searchers from Guam.
 The men were found about 190 kilometers (118 miles) from where they had set out.
 \"I am proud of the response and professionalism of all on board as we fulfill our obligation to contribute to the safety of life at sea wherever we are in the world,\" said the Canberra's commanding officer, Capt. Terry Morrison, in a statement.
 The men were found in good condition, and an Australian military helicopter was able to land on the beach and give them food and water. A Micronesian patrol vessel was due to pick them up.
 SOS is an internationally recognized distress signal that originates from Morse code.

 While being a cabbie involved driving for long hours at a stretch, Mr Swamy says that the income was sufficient. The situation is not the same now. “I bought vegetables worth ₹4,000. I managed to sell worth ₹2,500. I am facing a loss if I don’t get everything cleared by night. I still have ₹30,000 in EMIs left on the car. It is important that I make these payments,” he says.

WASHINGTON - Scientists say the nation is experiencing another public health emergency that will further exacerbate the coronavirus crisis: extreme heat.
   
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting the next three months will be hotter than normal for much of the country; 2020, it says, likely will rank as one of the hottest years on record.
   
 Communities of color, particularly lower-income Black and Latino neighborhoods, will be particularly affected. Extreme heat likely will push more residents into crowded cooling centers, where they may be exposed to the virus, and worsen breathing problems and other underlying health conditions that already disproportionately affect people of color, researchers say.
   
 As the summer heats up, cities are offering help with utility bills; repairing existing air conditioning systems or providing free air conditioners for low- income residents; opening more cooling centers; and parking buses with the air conditioning running so that passersby can cool off.
   
 But advocates and many scientists say officials need to develop strategies to protect the health of vulnerable communities for the long term, as climate change leads to more frequent and intense heat waves.
   
 That includes, they say, prioritizing federal and state spending for plans to mitigate extreme heat; strengthening the health care system and expanding telemedicine; improving air quality and reducing fossil fuel consumption. They also recommend expanding green spaces, painting roofs white and creating community outreach programs for vulnerable populations.
   
 As part of the CARES Act, the federal government this spring allocated $900 million in grants from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to states to support home energy assistance for low-income households affected by the coronavirus.
   
 And 26 states and the District of Columbia have issued moratoriums on shut- offs for nonpayment of gas, water and electricity bills, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.
   
 But many of the measures used to protect people from extreme heat, such as inviting people to cooling centers or movie theaters and malls, are incompatible with social distancing measures.
   
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that cooling centers screen for COVID-19 symptoms, provide ample hand sanitizer and masks, practice social distancing, limit visitors and ensure HVAC systems have proper air filtration. The CDC also recommends centers sanitize and disinfect spaces regularly and, where possible, use specialized systems known as upper-air ultraviolet germicidal irradiation disinfection systems.
   
 Widespread job loss because of the pandemic makes it hard for some residents to keep the air conditioners running - if, that is, they're lucky enough to have AC units in their homes. Energy assistance plans, which help low-income people with heating and cooling bills, vary greatly from state to state, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.
   
 For example, some states offer new air conditioning units for eligible residents, while others will repair or replace existing units and still others do not have an air conditioning program, according to the association.
   
 "Both short- and long-term approaches are needed," said Dr. Caren Solomon, a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Solomon is a co-author of an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine that said extreme heat poses additional challenges to COVID-19 mitigation efforts, as cooling centers may become crowded from households lacking air conditioning or facing heat-related electrical blackouts.
   
 "But we're in a situation where there's immediate risk for people in extreme weather," Solomon said.
   
 Chicago is a precursor for what's to come as the nation struggles with both climate change and a long-overdue reckoning over racial inequities, said Dr. Linda Rae Murray, former chief medical officer for the Cook County Department of Public Health who worked as an internist in the Cabrini-Green public housing community during the 1995 heat wave.
   
 The Chicago Department of Public Health did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
   
 A January study published by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute found a correlation between redlining and disproportionate exposure to extreme heat waves, which are worsened by climate change.
   
 Neighborhoods that were redlined in the past are more likely to have fewer trees, be near high-traffic freeways and have densely packed apartment buildings, all of which contribute to higher temperatures, the study found. The report was written by researchers at the Science Museum of Virginia, the Center for Environmental Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University and the School of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University.
   
 Historically redlined neighborhoods, where mortgage lenders refused to lend to Black people, now contain the country's hottest areas, the report found. Redlining increased segregation and decreased real estate investment, creating conditions where there were "fewer environmental amenities that help to clean and cool the air," such as tree-lined streets and parks, the report found.
   
 People of color are more likely to live in concrete-heavy, dense urban areas with few pockets of greenery known as heat islands, where heat gets trapped and the temperatures can be as much as 22 degrees higher than their surroundings, said Sacoby Wilson, an associate professor with the Maryland Institute for Applied Environmental Health and an expert in environmental justice and health disparities.
   
 Heat islands intensify air pollution and extreme hot weather, which can cause respiratory problems or heat stroke, Wilson said. What's more, extreme heat intensifies preexisting conditions such as heart, lung and kidney disease - conditions disproportionately affecting low-income people of color - making people sicker.
   
 And at the same time, extreme weather is driving people out of their homes in search of cooler conditions, he said.
   
 "When you have this major heat wave, folks are going to have to decide between staying indoors where they might not have air conditioning and staying in a mall, restaurant or church, where there is air conditioning but where they increase their exposure to the virus," Wilson said.
   
 And social welfare checks to make sure shut-in elderly residents are OK are harder to do safely during a pandemic, he said.
   
 Further complicating matters, low-income Black and Latino residents are more likely to live in crowded conditions without reliable access to healthy food and health care, he said. And they're more likely to be essential workers, often working more than one job to make ends meet, increasing their potential exposure to the coronavirus, Wilson said.
   
 "Heat waves are hell for the poor," Wilson said. "And COVID-19 is hell for the poor."
   
 The federal government allocated more money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to states to support home energy assistance for low-income households affected by the coronavirus. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, used that money to help residents weatherize their homes. Others, such as Ohio, looked to expand existing cooling assistance programs.
   
 In New York City, officials successfully lobbied the state to use the federal money to help low-income residents with their utilities.
   
 But critics argue the program is underfunded and comes with too many restrictions, such as requiring documentation from a doctor to qualify for assistance. In at least 26 states, public housing residents whose utilities are included in their rent aren't eligible for energy assistance under the assistance program, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   
 That means if they don't have AC units in their apartments - and most aging public housing complexes don't have them - they can't get help purchasing a unit, said Juan Declet-Barreto, a climate vulnerability social scientist with the Union for Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   
 Seventeen states don't have mandatory moratoriums on utility shut-offs, including Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida and Georgia, all COVID-19 hot spots, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.
   
 "In a setting of extreme heat, if people have adequate air conditioning, they can often stay at home," said Solomon, the co-author of the journal article. "But we're in a situation where people have lost their jobs. We need to make sure people's electricity and water aren't turned off."
   
 In the long term, cities, counties and states are going to have to come up with solutions to safeguard vulnerable communities from the vagaries of climate change, said Laurie Schoeman, senior program director for Enterprise Community Partners, a national affordable housing nonprofit.
   
 That means adopting a "reparative restoration" approach, investing in green solutions for communities that have shouldered the biggest environmental harms, Schoeman said.
   
 Some of the solutions are relatively inexpensive, such as painting roofs and asphalt light colors to reduce heat or planting more trees, said Schoeman, who sits on a New York City advisory board that focuses on equity in city planning.
   
 But ultimately, Schoeman said, "there has to be a fundamental shift in how these communities are planned."

WORCESTER -- A group of members of the local educators union has called on the organization's president to retract a public statement that the majority of teachers support the school district's program for police to be school resource officers.
 The school employees, who are calling themselves Member Voice, also want Roger Nugent and union leadership to issue a statement supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as an assurance the association will commit to pushing the district to end racism in the Worcester public schools.
 Elementary music teacher Netta Rappaport, one of the group members, said a letter listing those demands signed by 60 educators had not received a response from union leaders as of Tuesday afternoon.
 "There are two issues here," she said, the first of which is Member Voice's frustrations with what they perceive to be union leadership's "broad claims and endorsements" during the past two years that aren't always supported by data, and which have hurt the schools' relationship with the community, particularly families of color.
 The group says, for instance, the union recently put out a "poorly written, hastily executed" poll asking members their opinions on Black Lives Matter and police unions.
 Rappaport and another union member who spoke with the Telegram & Gazette on Tuesday, Yahaira Rodriguez, a middle school classroom aide, also said they don't support having resource officers at the schools, primarily because of the potentially stressful atmosphere they could create for some students.
 "I personally think (the school resource officer program) should be ended," Rappaport said. "Our communities of color do not necessarily have a positive relationship with police … to bring them into the schools, where they may make some students fearful, is entirely unnecessary."
 Nugent on Tuesday said he stood by his statement on school resource officers, which have become a source of contention in the city this year.
 "I'm not retracting it," he said. "What I said was true and accurate. I said the people I spoke to supported (the resource officer program) … what I said wasn't inflammatory."
 As for Member Voice's demand that the Educational Association of Worcester come out in support of Black Lives Matter, Nugent added, "We as a union don't endorse organizations" as a rule.
 Nugent on Tuesday said he was scheduled to discuss the group's letter on Tuesday afternoon; as of Tuesday evening, the Telegram & Gazette was unable to reach him for an update.
 Rappaport said she believes there are many more than 60 educators in the system who agree with Member Voice's stance. "A lot of people are afraid of speaking out," she added, because they fear they could face retaliation.
 On Tuesday, Rodriguez said Member Voice planned to organize a series of virtual town halls to further discuss the issue of racism in the schools and the union's role in helping to address it.
 The Educational Association of Worcester represents around 2,800 school employees.

I've never made peach cobbler using frozen peaches or dried cranberries, so I was curious to see how Fieri's recipe measured up.
 I started the peach filling by mixing brown and white sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt, and tossing the still-frozen peaches in to coat them.
 Next, I made a thickening "slurry" by dissolving a teaspoon of cornstarch into a tablespoon of water and adding the juice of one lemon. This got added to the peach mixture.
 After buttering my baking dish and pouring the peach mixture in, I made the crumb topping by mixing brown and white sugar, flour, oats, almonds, dried cranberries, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt with a stick of unsalted butter.
 I put half of the crumb mixture on top of the peaches before popping the dish in the oven and lowering the heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
 After baking this for half an hour, I layered on the rest of the crumb topping and baked it for another 45 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit.

Facebook has a long tradition of cloning competitive services. The Instagram “Story” feature, which lets people share photos and videos that expire in 24 hours, is similar to Snapchat. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&nbsp;faced tough questioning&nbsp;about the company’s habit of copying rivals before a congressional hearing on July 29.Facebook earlier launched a TikTok knockoff called Lasso in 2018, but closed that down in July. It also tried services similar to Snapchat called Slingshot and Poke before Instagram Stories caught on. But those were separate apps — it might have more success with a feature built into Instagram.In fact, copying Snapchat’s features was successful for Instagram in part because Snapchat was difficult to figure out for new users. They were already comfortable with Instagram. But&nbsp;TikTok is very easy to use&nbsp;-- easier than Instagram -- and part of its appeal is that you’re able to sit back and scroll endlessly with just swipes, without the need to follow anyone or post anything.For Reels to succeed, Facebook will have to lure video creators away from TikTok. This might be easier to do with Reels since many creators are already on Instagram. In response to&nbsp;published reports&nbsp;that Instagram is paying TikTok influencers to join Reels, Instagram said in a statement that the company “have a long history of reaching out to emerging creators and working to break new stars on Instagram.”“As with previous products, we remain committed to investing in both our creators and their overall experience, and in certain cases, we may help cover production costs for their creative ideas,” the company said.TikTok, in turn, launched a $200 million “creator fund” in July that it says will grow to over $1 billion in the U.S. in the next three years and more than double that globally, to pay video creators for their material.TikTok, however, is under fire, possibly opening an opportunity for Facebook.Microsoft is in talks&nbsp;to buy part of TikTok in what would be a forced sale, following threats from President Donald Trump to ban the Chinese-owned video app, which claims 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.Since early July, TikTok users have been posting videos urging viewers to follow them to other platforms like Instagram, reflecting the threat of a TikTok ban. Mary Keane-Dawson, Group CEO at influencer marketing agency Takumi, said the influencers she works with have been sad, angry and upset about the threat of a ban. Still, they’re “pragmatic,” she said, and the smart ones were already active on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.Reels is debuting in over 50 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Australia and others, as well as officially launching in the test countries — Brazil, France, Germany and India.Instagram has more than a billion users worldwide. TikTok says it has 100 million users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) -- When Sharon Taylor died of coronavirus, her family -- standing apart, wearing masks -- sang her favorite hymns at her graveside, next to a tiny headstone for her stillborn daughter, buried 26 years ago. Fresh flowers marked row after row of new graves. Holy Rosary is one of the only cemeteries in this Choctaw Indian family's community, and it's running out of space -- a sign of the virus's massive toll on the Choctaw people.
