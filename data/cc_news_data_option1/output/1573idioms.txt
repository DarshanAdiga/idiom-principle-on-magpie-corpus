For those worried about the carbon-emitting nature of fossil fuels, the oil price slide could be cause for satisfaction. If prices crater, shale oil producers go out of business, a nail in the coffin for an energy-intensive extraction process. But it’s also a process that made the U.S. less dependent on OPEC.
 In the long run, it remains to be seen whether drivers return to their gas- guzzling ways when the economy gets back on track. Those oil shocks in the 1970s helped change behavior, driving a demand for greater efficiency on both the consumer and regulatory levels. But those changes can be fleeting and even the biggest shock eventually fades into memory. Overall petroleum usage declined in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, before beginning a steady ascent until the 2008 financial crisis.

Some refugee camps have been around so long they have apartment blocks and paved roads. Others are little more than clusters of tents or abandoned buildings. In many, cramped conditions and poor infrastructure can make it impossible to practice social distancing and frequent hand-washing.

President Wilson and his pricey, imported administrative team will move on to greener pastures in a few years. If the “demolition derby” proceeds as slated, this community will be left to pick up the pieces and begin again the serious business of building a regional university.

We need vision for Western’s future
 Western faculty member Bill Church, retired faculty member John Tapia and a recent editorial have raised important questions, in this newspaper, about the role of the Board of Governors — political appointees with fiduciary responsibilities — in Western’s financial crisis. Unfortunately, reports also in this newspaper suggest that the Board of Governors will mutely stand behind the “wrecking ball” approach to solvency of President Wilson. The proposed solution will eliminate many faculty members who have put down roots in this community. Fifty years of building a regional university will go down the drain quickly and we will be left with a nursing and business school remnant.
 With the pandemic, the financial situation of Western and every higher education institution is now even more precarious.

With great sadness, her family announces the passing of Beverly Smith Amell Rabette, aged 75, on April 17, 2020. She was born and spent her young years in Tenafly New Jersey, Scranton Pennsylvania, Scituate and Wayland Massachusetts, and later settled in Framingham Massachusetts, where she has lived with her husband, caretaker and love of her life, Paul Rabette, for the past 35 years. In her younger years, Beverly loved long nature walks and time spent at the beach, especially on Cape Cod, with her mom, Martha Smith (predeceased), husband, children (and, later, grandchildren). She also enjoyed bowling and dancing and was a big movie fan. In more recent years, she enjoyed coloring in her design books, which she found calming and an outlet for her creative energy. Beverlys greatest joy and source of pride was her family, often sharing photos with friends or any acquaintance she could capture for a few minutes. She loved her family unconditionally and, without a doubt, her favorite pastime was spending time with them. When visiting her son John Amell, daughter-in-law Angela and granddaughters Sara and Maria (and her husband Carlos) in Plymouth, MA they would enjoy walking to their local beach, playing board games, watching tv game shows and movies together and enjoying a dinner at her favorite restaurant, Olive Garden. Beverly and Paul would travel to California for long visits spent with her daughter Jen Capizzo, son-in-law Franco, grandson Evan and Beverlys other son Jimmy Amell. While there, she found joy celebrating the holidays, especially decorating Christmas cookies, taking drives to look at decorated houses, and trips to the beach to watch the sunset. During these visits, she would spend endless hours playing board games with Jimmy and coloring and talking with Evan. Beverly was over the moon to have recently been able to spend Christmas with her other son Joe Amell, daughter-in-law Julie and grandchildren Emily, Ben and Jessica, who visited from Australia in 2017. She often spoke of hoping to travel to Australia one day to visit them all. Beverly will also be dearly missed by her sister, Laura Carstoiu, brother, Jim Smith, sister-in-law Kate Kelly, and many nephews, nieces and friends. Beverly will be greatly missed for the unconditional love she shared, her happy nature, her ability to easily strike up a conversation and make friends wherever she went, her joy in the small moments, her soft spot for children and animals, and her kind and gentle soul. Beverly will be buried in Edgell Grove Cemetery in Framingham, MA once the recent travel restrictions have been lifted. In honor of all the special memories made with her family on many walks over many years at the Wellfleet Sanctuary, memorial donations can be made to Massachusettss Audubon Society in her name. Arrangements by the McCarthy, McKinney & Lawler Funeral Home of Framingham. You may also share happy memories or leave condolences for her family at, www.mccarthyfh.com

Gov. Henry McMaster announced Monday that he is canceling his order that the state's beaches close and that retail stores close.
   
 The stores affected by the governor's order include furniture stores, clothing stores, sporting goods stores, florists, shoe stores, department stores, music stores, craft stores and flea markets, he said.
   
 McMaster said that stores must abide by social distancing rules set in other sections of his emergency executive order.
   
 All of the Herald-Journal's coverage of coronavirus is being provided for free to our readers. Please consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to GoUpstate.
   
 Stores are limited in how many customers they can allow into the store at any one time. That limit is either 20% of their maximum occupancy or five customers per 1,000 square feet of space.
   
 The governor said that canceling his order closing the beaches puts the decision over whether to open those beaches on local governments in those areas.
   
 He said he had spoken to mayors along the coast, and those officials will be responsible for deciding when the beaches in their jurisdictions open.
   
 Even if the beaches are open, law enforcement officers will still be responsible for dispersing groups of three or more who represent a risk to the health situation in the state, he said.
   
 McMaster said he is able to relax the rules because the people of the state are complying with the state and federal rules recommended to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 "In light of the common sense being shown by the great people of South Carolina, we are ready to take some steps that will help South Carolina assure that our economic health is as strong as our public health," he said.
   
 The governor cautioned residents to continue to take precautions. "We are still in a very serious situation," he said. The virus is deadly and spreads very easily, and people need to practice social distancing.
   
 McMaster said the "measured, deliberate approach" the state has taken is working. He said state policy has been aimed at restricting the spread of the virus as much as possible while harming the state's economy as little as possible.
   
 He spoke about his Accelerate SC campaign, which pulls together state officials with business people from various industries to ramp up the state economy as soon as possible.
   
 The governor said the group will look at workforce issues, logistics and transportation issues in order to "slingshot around the competition" and get the state's business climate up to pre-virus speed quickly.
