Some day, Mark Giordano, Michael Stone, Mark Jankowski, Matthew Phillips, and Dillon Dube are going to be sick of each other.
 But Monday was not that day.
 Tuesday likely won't be either.
 The five Calgary Flames teammates are simply excited to be out of their houses, together with their crew and back on the ice, trying to inject some normalcy back into their daily routine since the start of the National Hockey League's 'Return to Play' Phase 2 officially kicked off last week.
 "It is what it is right now," Dube said, following the team's Monday ice time at Scotiabank Saddledome which remains closed except for a select group of team personnel. "Guys are ready to come back. We're just waiting to see more of a plan but I think guys are going to be on their way really soon. I like the group right now. But it doesn't really matter who all is here, we're all just happy to be back on the ice. I know guys that aren't here are doing whatever they can to be ready to go.   "We're going to take strides and get ready to go, regardless. But I definitely just enjoy being back right now."
 Three months ago, when the COVID-19 outbreak put the entire world on pause, including the NHL, players and teams -- not to mention the city, province, country and continent -- had no idea what to expect.
 Many of the Flames' players stuck around the city for a bit, until eventually receiving word they could head back to their hometowns, cities, and countries. Giordano, who calls Calgary home year-round, hunkered down with his wife Lauren and their two young kids Jack and Reese. Jankowski, his girlfriend Rachel, and their puppy Lucy headed back to Ontario, only recently returning when the NHL's plans began solidifying and the province of Alberta began its' relaunch program.
 Dube and his brother Jake made regular trips from their Calgary apartment to their family's home in Cochrane, where they were able to workout and see their grandpa.
 Meanwhile, Stone's family quarantine bubble consisted of his wife Michelle, their twins Wyatt and Jolie and young son Rhett, along with Michelle's parents.
 "It was not normal to be stopped so suddenly," Stone said. "We didn't say goodbye to anyone and didn't really end things because things aren't done. That was weird. So it's nice to get back."
 But now, their daily routines include commuting back to the Saddledome where they are just beginning Phase 2 which includes small group skates and workouts at the team facilities -- a back-to-action, skate-off-the-summer-rust, return- from-off-season series of ice times.
 Except it wasn't the off-season. And it's only the start of summer.
 "It's different, being the middle of June and we're just getting started again," Stone said. "This is when I would start skating to get ready for the next season. And it doesn't feel like a normal off-season because we haven't been training like a normal off-season.
 "It's completely different than normal."
 The Flames are expecting players to filter into Calgary as the days roll on, a large portion of them awaiting Canada's quarantine rules regarding international travel and mandatory isolation for 14-days. That could change, should the NHL receive an exemption to include their facilities as part of the quarantine 'bubble.'
 So, right now, it is just a small group so far. Hence the quality time between the 'Fab Five.' No goalies.
 "I think getting on the ice is the best part of it, regardless if there are goalies or not," Dube said. "That's the least of my worries. You just want to get your touches back. It's been two days in, maybe if it's two weeks in you would get annoyed by it. But I don't think it's bothered anybody else."
 Outside of the normal creakiness, after being off the ice completely for three months, Dube reported that it wasn't as bad as he thought.
 And that he wasn't completely in off-season mode; that the season is just getting ready to heat up again.
 "You're going to expect it, especially how the season ended right away," he said. "You didn't have a chance to mentally regain yourself and go into normal summer mode. When you're back on the ice, you're ready for it. The whole time (during the pause) you were just waiting. I was wanting to get back for so long.
 "But mentally, it was a bit different … I actually felt better Friday than I did (Monday)."
 Because, in many ways, the reality is starting to sink in.
 Just like every day of quarantine felt a bit like Groundhog Day on repeat, the Flames will be starting to feel the same way about a month of voluntary workouts and skates before training camp starts on July 10.
 However, Phase 2 is necessary -- especially given the stakes on the horizon and how fast things are going to ramp up, even if it is in an unorthodox fashion.
 "I'm really excited for this phase," Dube said. "I'm going to need it. I think everyone's going to need it. I think it's really big for us to have this Phase … I really need to get myself ready so I don't want to jump too far ahead. We've had two skates so far. Obviously, we're really excited to play but I need to get my game back to where it needs to be.

What to make of the imbroglio around Wichita State University president Jay Golden?
   
 To recap, presidential daughter Ivanka Trump was briefly invited to deliver a virtual commencement speech to graduates of WSU Tech. After an outcry from students and staff, lent urgency by national protests against racist policy, Golden rescinded the younger Trump's invitation.
   
 The outcry from high-profile fundraisers and supporters of the university was immediate, with those connected to Koch Industries and Pizza Hut voicing their displeasure. Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo weighed in, also criticizing the decision.
   
 Some vociferous voices called for Golden's removal.
   
 But after a lengthy meeting, the Kansas Board of Regents declined to do so. They and Golden issued separate statements supporting free speech, along with diversity and inclusion. Koch voiced displeasure but said it would continue funding the commitments it made to the school.
   
 Here's the thing: Golden made the right call. Universities ultimately serve students, not donors. If students raise their voices in calling for change, higher education institutions should listen. Even those with extravagant wealth, such as the Koch family, don't get to call the shots -- unless they choose to open their own university (although perhaps we shouldn't be giving them ideas).
   
 Let's also dispense with the notion that disinviting Ivanka Trump had anything to do with freedom of speech or discussion. That's nonsense.
   
 Her remarks were released to the public soon after the controversy, and they're viewable by anyone with an internet connection. She or her father have abundant opportunity to reach the public through social media and public appearances. They both have arguably more opportunity to speak and be heard than the vast majority of Americans.
   
 No, what students and staff objected to was connecting Wichita State to that of a U.S. president with a history of racially charged statements and his daughter, whose prime qualification for giving a public speech is genetic.
   
 There's no reason that WSU should lift them up if it chooses not to.
   
 Yes, the college and its president may still face consequences. But standing on principle, even if inconvenient, should be noted. Inviting the speech in the first place was likely a mistake. Making it right took courage and a willingness to stand up to powerful interests. That's worthy of praise, not condemnation.

This new urgency that uses George Floyd's murder as an excuse to rush towards ending racism in America and police reform and defunding police departments, in such a way that only serves the criminals, is all based on a false premise and narrative, as born out by the statistics. Typically, police show up according to where the most crimes are being committed, and because blacks commit and inordinate amount of the crimes in urban areas, they are very often profiled, unfortunately, whether they are up to no good or not. And, from all indications, the real racists in this entire scenario are those members of Black Lives Matter who see all conservative Americans today as racists of the worst order.

They are systematically reducing the fundamentals of citizenship to race, in the wake of the Civil Rights era and sowing greater distrust and painful conflict. But that's precisely what their purposeful daily hunt for racism in every corner of our nation's institutions is intended to do, and it is necessary to their plans to eventually destroy this republic, by any means necessary.

When Tanner Burns had his name called, and it was official he had been drafted by the Indians, he breathed a sigh of relief that had been in the making for years.
   
 Burns, a right-handed pitcher out of Auburn, was selected by the Indians with the No. 36 overall pick in the draft. Before he allowed himself to think of the future, he first looked toward his past.
   
 "I saw my name get announced, you know, I had all these thoughts in my head, spending my parents' money growing up with travel ball, them coming to my games, my starts at Auburn, and thinking about everything starting to pay off, the sacrifices I've [made] leading up to my senior year of high school and going to Auburn, and sometimes having to sacrifice stuff I didn't want to because I wanted to focus on baseball and make it a job," Burns said on a conference call with reporters on Monday. "And it was one of those things where I felt like I had a 10-pound vest on and I could take it off when my name got called."
   
 Burns' thoughts also turned to Casey Mize, his former teammate and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft to the Detroit Tigers. Upon going to Auburn, Burns' goal was to immediately stick in the Tigers' weekend rotation, along with the already established Mize. But coming out of high school, he essentially had zero idea of how to keep and hold a steady routine between starts since he played both ways. In high school, whenever he left the mound he'd be inserted at shortstop. He wasn't taking care of himself the way he should, at least not to the level of a top-tier collegiate starting pitcher.
   
 Mize changed all that. And when he talked, Burns listened and eventually altered his eating schedule, his workout routine and even when he slept.
   
 "My freshman year, he took me under his wing," Burns said. "[Mize] said, 'This is what you need to do to have success.' I took that to heart because I wanted to be in the weekend rotation my freshman year. ... He's the one that put me on the routine of sleep, nutrition, weights in the weight room. He had a big impact on my life my freshman year. I've had the same routine since my freshman year. We're good friends. He even invited me to his wedding. We have a relationship that he'll be my best friend probably for the rest of my life."
   
 The hydration element ended up being an issue that had to be resolved later on. Burns was having issues with his shoulder and was wearing down at times while at Auburn. He eventually discovered it wasn't as much of a direct shoulder issue as it was a hydration problem that was affecting the shoulder. He still wasn't hydrating himself properly.
   
 "My muscles were tensing up and that's what caused me to be fatigued," Burns said. "But yeah, during this time, I've learned how to take care of my body more ... I always feel like everything happens for a reason."
   
 Burns had his time at Auburn cut short by the coronavirus outbreak, but with what time he had, he spent as much of it as he could listening to Auburn's new pitching coach and former big leaguer Tim Hudson. Hudson further built on the advice from Mize, essentially saying that Burns had the stuff to be good, but it wasn't on its own enough to be elite.
   
 "He mainly focused on throwing during the week," Burns said. "You know, let's say I had a good start. I threw six, seven, eight innings, my throwing would be different if I threw three innings and didn't do well. So I mean, that's what I took from him. ... He always told me there's good guys in Triple-A and Double-A that have good arms, but what separates a big leaguer is shoulders up so that's what [I] took from him, the mental side and the recovery during the week."
   
 Burns said he was excited to go to an organization like the Indians, who have a stellar recent track record developing pitchers such as Shane Bieber, Aaron Civale and several others. The opportunity to be put into the best hands possible for his development on the mound was the key reason why Burns, a lifelong Alabama fan growing up, went to arch-rival Auburn instead. Burns feels like that's still the case with the Indians.
   
 "You know, you don't see the Indians going out and buying players," Burns said. "They must be doing something right in seeing guys they draft and getting them to the big leagues. ... The whole reason was to go to Auburn was because I knew they [were] gonna take care of me and they took care of my arm. ... So I've been very fortunate, the last three years at Auburn and then getting drafted by the Indians. I've been on a pitcher's side of programs."

The death of George Floyd has set off a wave of violent unrest across the United States. In its wake, a disturbing narrative has emerged from the woke left deeming this violence a legitimate, effective means of compelling political change. Widely advocated by young, progressive liberals, this position aligns with an increasingly popular view among Democrats that peaceful protest is but one option rather than the rule, especially when supporting violence provides an opportunity to repudiate one's privilege while proclaiming infallible allegiance to Black Lives Matter. But this normalization of violence proves a slippery slope that places American lives at the mercy of the liberal left's group-think culture.
