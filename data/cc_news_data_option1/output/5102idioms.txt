In the current environment with COVID, studios by and large have been delaying releases, or with clients’ consent and inclusion in the process, selling the movies to streaming platforms. But what Warner Bros. has decided to do is push forward with a theatrical release in the darkest days of COVID. At a time where our own government leaders are telling us to stay home and away from loved ones, Warner Bros. is doubling down on ensuring box office failure and even worse, putting movie-goers who want to see a movie in a theater at risk.

_Rick and Morty_ has shared a fun behind-the-scenes look at the Glorzo episode, "Promortyus." Following the debut of the first five episodes toward the end of 2019, _Rick and Morty_ returned for the final five episodes of the fourth season earlier this year. One of these final episodes saw Rick and Morty stumbling across an egg with a face hugging alien inside of it much like the _Alien_ franchise. But unlike the _Alien_ franchise, these aliens were a much more advanced species than expected with their own value system. But when the titular duo took back control, they suitably ruined things.
  _Rick and_ _Morty'_ s "Promortyus" features one of the most destructive scenes in the fourth season overall, and Adult Swim actually gave fans a look at how this scene came together. With a fun video showing how the storyboards for this particularly destructive scene came together, fans can now see how the original ideas compared to the final product. You can check it out in the video above!
 This episode might not be the most well liked out of the fourth season overall, but it's certainly one of the most memorable as the hilarious Glorzo have since inspired cosplay and more. It's the sort of randomness fans will be looking forward to when the fifth season of the series finally makes its debut. This fifth season has yet to confirm a release date, however.
 While fans are currently waiting on the fifth season of the series, the writing team behind the series is currently working on the sixth and even seventh seasons of the series. As for what we can expect to see in the fifth season, producer and writer Scott Marder teased that there would be some "epic" canonical additions for the fifth season of the series. With the fourth season mostly straying away from its canon until the final episode, this should be good news to fans who enjoy that aspect of the franchise.
  _Rick and Morty'_ s fifth season is currently in the works, and it's already been confirmed to continue to several other episodes beyond it. What did you think of this behind-the-scenes look at the Glorzo episode? Does it make you want to give glory to Glorzo? What were your favorite moments of the fourth season? Let us know your thoughts in the comments or you can even reach out to me directly about all things animated and other cool stuff @Valdezology on Twitter!

My wave of grief led me to quickly pack up the rest of the boxes and load them in my car. Sorting could happen later — even if it meant bringing things back. I wasn’t going to let this momentary sadness keep me from creating new memories with my kids as we put up a tree in my home.


  It was the best thing I could have done. Reaching into one of the boxes, my daughter pulled out another family ornament that I’d overlooked days earlier. She jokingly asked if we could cut it apart. A vision of King Solomon with the two mothers and baby flashed in my head. I said that it wouldn’t be necessary — she could just take it back to her Dad’s, but that I wanted the mitten/snowpeople ornament.


  She also helped me decide homes for all of the travel decorations we had accumulated. Interestingly enough, on most of our trips, I’d purchased at least two ornaments. For the trips represented by only one, she and I talked through who should keep it and why. Sharing stories of those vacations, reliving memories with her, helped heal some of my grief.


  Still, I was a bit melancholy. This time, I rode that wave of sadness to the local Hallmark, in search of something to commemorate a new beginning, our new normal. Though “Our first Christmas” ornaments are plentiful, Hallmark has yet to offer a “Just Divorced” or something to proclaim “Our last Christmas,” but those really weren’t what I wanted.


  Then, I spotted it. Although I’m certain this decoration was designed to celebrate adoption, it truly fit. Last year, when we told the kids of our plans to separate, we assured them that we were “still a family, even if we are living in different places.” The silver snowflake with a heart suspended in the center celebrates a “Forever Family.”


  Holding back tears, I bought two.

Estrenada por el canal Nickelodeon en Estados Unidos y emitida en numerosos países, 'iCarly' narraba la historia de un grupo de estudiantes que creaba un programa casero de televisión online para cumplir con un trabajo de clase y se veía sorprendido por el éxito del formato doméstico en la red.
 Miranda Cosgrove encarnaba al personaje de la protagonista, Carly Shay, que se convertía en la estrella de internet gracias a la ayuda de su amiga Sam y de su vecino Freddie.
 Este no es el único 'revival' pensado para el futuro servicio Paramount Plus, pues la esperada serie televisiva basada en el musical 'Grease' (1978) será una de las apuestas de su catálogo tras el rechazo de HBO Max
 'Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies' es el título del proyecto, que se rodará en California bajo la supervisión de los mismos estudios que crearon la famosa película protagonizada por John Travolta y Olivia Newton-John.
 La idea de hacer nuevas versiones de producciones de éxito es la misma que ha seguido la cadena de televisión NBC para su plataforma 'Peacock', que acaba de estrenar la serie 'Saved By The Bell' adaptada al 2020, o la que aplicará The CW con una nueva tanda de aventuras de las míticas 'The Powerpuff Girls' pensada para adultos.

State officials Friday rolled out more details for the state COVID-19 vaccination timetable, with plans to start making vaccinations available to the general public by mid-March 2021.


  While they said it is impossible to know at the moment how long it will take to get a sizable number of West Virginians vaccinated, they’re hoping production of the Pfizer, Moderna, and other vaccines will ramp as the spring and summer goes on.


  “We do anticipate the number of vaccinations will go up substantially over time,” Dr. Clay Marsh, state COVID-19 czar and vice president of health sciences at West Virginia University, said during Friday’s COVID-19 briefing.


  Marsh said about 70% of the population will need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity — the point at which the virus begins to die out because it can no longer find sufficient numbers of vulnerable individuals to infect.


  With FDA emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine imminent, and with authorization of the Moderna vaccine anticipated in days, and with at least two other COVID-19 vaccines in the pipeline, state officials on Friday were optimistic that vaccinations can ramp up dramatically during the spring and summer.


  “I chose to be optimistic, but not unrealistic,” Gov. Jim Justice said of the ramp-up.


  State officials offered more details on what will be a two-phase rollout of vaccinations, with a limited number of doses available initially.


  The first phase sets priorities for health care providers and other medical professionals, along with the state’s most vulnerable population, nursing home residents.


  First responders and public health officials will also have high priority.


  Also in the first phase, but at a lower priority, the rollout calls for vaccinations for K-12 and higher education faculty and staff, and for those providing critical services in government, public utilities, and transportation.

New Delhi [India], December 11 (ANI): Highlighting the importance of the India-Pacific region, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Friday said there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean Region in support of various missions.   "Most of the countries in the region are seeking to reap the economic dividends through improved connectivity and harnessing blue economy for which infrastructure is a pre-requisite. Residents' powers and extra-regional power have shown a renewed interest in investing in infrastructure development in these countries to maintain and increase geopolitical influence," General Rawat said while delivering a keynote address at the Global Dialogue Security Summit.   Speaking on the theme of "Contesting the Indo Pacific for Global Domination", CDS Rawat said that presently there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean Region in support of various missions.   "In recent years, China's economy and military rise coupled with competition to increase the influence in the region has attracted a great deal of interest. At present, there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean Region in support of various missions. Till now, the region, by and large, has remained peaceful albeit under contestation," CDS Rawat said.   "In the military field, technology must be a means of deterrence not a source of destruction. Our approach to security hence needs to shift from unilateral to the multilateral mode which mandates increasing training engagements with partner nations in order to fortify future," he said.   He further said governance and security are under constant threat of being undermined by non-state actors and also naval competition among the states.   "Governance and security are under constant threat of being undermined by non- state actors and also naval competition among the states. To protect peace, prosperity and sovereignty it is important for us to keep a sea line of communication secure at all times with a stronghold on the security dimension of this region," General Rawat said.

Madrid [Spain], December 11 (ANI): Atletico Madrid defender Stefan Savic has said that the clash against Real Madrid in the ongoing LaLiga will be "very special" and his team has a great chance of winning the title this year. Atletico Madrid will lock horns with defending champions Real Madrid on Saturday.   Savic said growing up it was his dream to play against the reigning champions and if a player wants to improve he should be competing against tough teams.   "Playing against Real Madrid is always very special. When you are a kid you dream of playing in big matches and this is one of those," Savic said in the LaLiga release.  
 "It's the game which you just can't miss we're hoping for great things this year and if you want to achieve great things you've got to be at a high level in these games as we were against Barcelona. We want to do the same against Real Madrid," he added.   Atletico Madrid have got off to a thunderous start in this season. The side is currently at the top of the table with eight wins from 10 games.   "We've certainly had a good start for this season and we're pleased with our results so far, especially in LaLiga. We've just got to keep on working hard, that the only way this fine squad of ours can achieve great things," said Savic.   The defender also revealed that manager Diego Simeone has helped him a lot in improving as a player. "The gaffer has helped me a lot in my development. I'm not the player I am today just because I'm 29 years old, but because I've spent six years here training and trying to improve every single day," said Savic.   Atletico Madrid on Wednesday defeated Salzburg 2-0 to secure a spot in the Champions League knockout stages. "We're taking it a game at a time as we've always been doing up until now. I think we have got a great chance of winning a title this year," Savic signed off. (ANI)
