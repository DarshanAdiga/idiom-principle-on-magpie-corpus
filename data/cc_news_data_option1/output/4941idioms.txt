CHICAGO - A federal judge on Tuesday struck down two Trump administration rules designed to drastically curtail the number of visas issued each year to skilled foreign workers.
 The changes applying to the H-1B visa program announced in October include imposing salary requirements on companies employing skilled overseas workers and limits on specialty occupations. Department of Homeland Security officials deemed it a priority because of coronavirus-related job losses and estimated as many as one-third of those who have applied for H-1B's in recent years would be denied under the new rules.
 U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in California said the government didn't follow transparency procedures and its contention that the changes were an emergency response to pandemic job losses didn’t hold water because the Trump administration has floated the idea for some time but only published the rules in October.

Lee’s father, Lee Kun-hee, died in October after a 2014 heart attack he never fully recovered from. Though Lee Jae-yong has in practice run Samsung since his father’s hospitalisation six years ago, the outcomes of the two trials – one relating to a 2015 merger that allowed him to take more control over Samsung, and the other for a bribery scandal involving impeached former South Korean president Park Geun-hye, for which he has already served a year in prison – are standing in the way of his formally taking over the top job.

Newsom, who has appealed to Californians to “do your part" and stay home, apologized when the 12-person dinner was reported, then again when photos emerged showing him, his wife and others sitting close together at the same table without masks.
 Breed's spokesman, Jeff Cretan, called the mayor's French Laundry dinner a “small family birthday dinner." He did not immediately respond to a telephone message Tuesday inquiring whether the dinner involved more than three different households, which are prohibited under the state's rules.
 Before the Chronicle's story was posted Tuesday, Breed thanked residents for doing their part by limiting contact with others, saying on a live stream that “as someone who basically lives alone, it’s been a tough year for me personally."
 Earlier in the day, Liccardo apologized for attending a Thanksgiving get- together at his parents' home that included people from five different households.
 “I apologize for my decision to gather contrary to state rules, by attending this Thanksgiving meal with my family," Liccardo said in a statement. “I understand my obligation as a public official to provide exemplary compliance with the public health orders, and certainly not to ignore them. I commit to do better.”
 Liccardo said there were eight members from five different households and that they all dined outside at separate tables on the back patio, wearing masks when they were not eating.

San Diego started 8-1 that season before losing the final six games in a 15-game strike-shortened campaign.

Until then, SPACs hold your cash in trust, generally earning a relatively low rate of interest, say 1% or less. So, you’re initially investing in short-term treasury yields, parking your capital. Then, once the target is announced, your SPAC shares will start to experience greater volatility as investors get on and off the stock based on their opinions about the tentative combination.

Have you ever wondered how it is that a nation and its government that was founded and based on the Bible, God’s word, and so richly blessed by God, fall away from it to the place where, what was evil is now good and what was good is not evil? We have exchanged the sound, priceless teaching and guidelines of the Bible for the flawed, at best, misguided, selfish, evil lust of mankind — then wonder why we are in the mess we are with problems we can’t seem to fix.
 Kind of reminds me of Old Testament Israel, when they turned their backs on God and found themselves in all kinds of problems, even to being under foreign rulers. It remained until they came to their senses and listened to God’s prophets and turned back to God. When they repented their sins and turned from their evil ways, God forgave and restored them. I certainly hope and pray that it doesn’t come to that before we see the light and come to our senses.
