DuBOIS — A Clearfield man, who allegedly received a stolen vehicle and then fled from police, waived his preliminary hearing last week before District Judge Patrick Ford of DuBois.
 On July 7, DuBois City Police charged Dwight David Woodyard, 35, Clearfield, with receiving stolen property and fleeing or attempting to elude an officer, both felonies in the third degree, and misdemeanor counts of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, flight to avoid apprehension, accident involving damage attended vehicle, driving under the influence of a controlled substance and several summary traffic violations, according to a criminal complaint filed at Ford’s office.
 Woodyard’s monetary bail was changed from $25,000, monetary, to $15,000, monetary. He is still incarcerated in the Clearfield County Jail.
 According to the affidavit of probable cause, the police were on normal patrol at 7:53 a.m. July 6 and saw a white-colored vehicle with one occupant sitting behind the Pulaski Club in the parking lot on Chestnut Street.
 Because the city police has received information of possible drug activity in that lot, and because the business was closed at the time, the police turned around to watch the vehicle and its occupant for any possible activity, the affidavit said. As the police were traveling down Miners Alley to find a place to observe, the vehicle turned left out of the parking lot onto Chestnut Street. As the police turned onto Chestnut, the vehicle already crossed over at West Washington Avenue driving at a high rate of speed.
 According to the affidavit, the vehicle then turned right onto West Weber Avenue, failing to stop at a clearly posted stop sign and not using a proper turn signal. The vehicle continued traveling west on West Weber Avenue at a high rate of speed. The vehicle then turned right onto West Long Avenue, still at a high rate of speed. The vehicle then turned right onto West Long Avenue failing to stop at a clearly posted stop sign. The officer activated his emergency lights on the patrol unit and performed a traffic stop in front of 801 W. Long Ave. The driver did pull to the right hand curb and placed his vehicle into park.
