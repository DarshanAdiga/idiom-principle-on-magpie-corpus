The Israeli prime minister was pushing on with what Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the `'peace of the brave," based on the 1993 Oslo peace accords. Two years after the groundbreaking handshake on the White House lawn between the two men, Rabin was killed by an Israeli extremist opposed to peace negotiations with the Palestinians at a rally promoting the accords. Successive right-wing Israeli governments, which prolonged the occupation, and a weakened Palestinian leadership have overseen a process that was moribund and now effectively dead in the water after a series of moves by President Donald Trump have been widely perceived as favoring Israel and punishing the Palestinians.

The boys were school-aged by the time he reached the NHL as an assistant in Detroit in 2005. They spent most of their teenage years in San Jose, where McLellan was the head coach of the Sharks from 2008 to 2015.
 When the boys were old enough, McLellan would let them tag along to work. Tyson remembers sitting in on McLellan’s coaching meetings as a kid. Cale helped out the Sharks’ equipment staff for a couple years, placing him near the end of the bench and within earshot of his dad during games.
 As they learned from him, he was keenly observing them too.
 In school, for instance, McLellan quickly realized his boys interacted with teachers in a way he never did.
 “They have courage to reach out to a teacher and challenge a grade on a paper,” he recalled. “I would have never done that. I would have taken, ‘This is the grade I got. That’s what I earned. Away we go.’ But they’re willing to put themselves out there and say, ‘Hey, what about this? Why do you think this wasn’t like this?’ ”

Behind the scenes, the strike triggered urgent flurries of diplomatic activity. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo worked phones, calling world capitals to defend Trump’s decision. He said the U.S. is committed to de- escalating tensions that have soared since Iranian-backed militia killed an American contractor and the U.S. responded with strikes on the militia. That set off violent pro-Iran protests outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which in turn set the stage for the killing of Soleimani.

Despite some tough times for farmers in recent years, cutting production costs may not be high on their priority lists as the 2020 planting season approaches.
 “We’re always looking to cut, but you can only cut so far,” said Illinois farmer Jim Raben, who grows corn and soybeans near Ridgway in Gallatin County. “You like to cut down on chemicals and fertilizer, but you’re going to cut production as well. It’s a negative cut.”
 University of Illinois ag economist Scott Irwin said the sky is not falling, and therefore making big cuts could hurt farmers in the long term. He sees light at the end of the tunnel, especially regarding a tentative trade pact between the U.S. and China.

The price of oil has surged since news of the airstrike broke and uncertainty has gripped global investors, who are trying to gauge what Iran's response will be.
 In previous tensions with the U.S., Iran has threatened the supply of oil that travels from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. About 20% of oil traded worldwide travels by ship from the gulf.
 Analysts say Iran is expected to respond to the killing but perhaps not immediately. The international benchmark for crude oil jumped 4.1%, or $2.70, to $68.95 a barrel on Friday.
 Urgent reconciliation efforts are being launched behind the scenes.

Nearly 50 years later, Saudi Arabia and Israel now have an alliance of convenience, mostly behind closed doors, in their shared view of Iran as a staunch enemy causing regional mayhem.

Russian's foreign minister also warned that Iran's nuclear deal with world powers is in danger of “falling apart" as neither the United States nor the European Union is complying with the accord. Sergei Lavrov accused the U.S. of “towing” a “destructive line” by withdrawing from the deal and imposing sanctions that crippled the Iranian economy.
 The 2015 deal between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. In response to the U.S. sanctions, Iran has inched its way toward violating the accord.
 Lavrov said Russia would demand full compliance from both the U.S. and the EU, saying otherwise the agreement should be considered “no longer existing.”

These three questions were quickly boiled down to just two. There is no doubt the virus can be transmitted by feed, Niederwerder said.
 “When we think about all the risk factors for ASF, the question is always: how would that get to our pigs,” she said. “We know how that would happen with feed. That’s not a question at all for feed.”
 Looking into the next part of the equation - how it would survive during transit – was done in part due to a technique developed at SDSU. Kansas State used chambers designed to simulate trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific travel, and SDSU is to thank for those techniques.
 The team at Kansas State studied many viruses during this test, but focused on African swine fever and classical swine fever.

“He was always looking to see what drives us as a younger generation, what gets to us,” said Tyson, recalling how during summer trips to the family’s home in Kelowna, Canada, McLellan would play Spikeball with his sons and their friends, sit with them while they watched hockey and talked about the game, or simply razz them lounging around the house.
 Said Cale: “If you ask any of my friends, they’d laugh. He’s always there. He’s always chirpin’ Tyson and I. He likes to be in that mix. He’s soaking up how we interact with each other, you know. How we live.”
 McLellan learned from the hard days, such as when Tyson was suspended from school in the fourth grade along with some of his friends for teasingly tripping each other with Hula Hoops. He also cherished the rewarding ones.
 Tyson left home at 16 to pursue a junior hockey career and, three years later, earned a spot on Denver’s Division I team. Cale quit the family sport at age 10 — “It took a lot of courage for him to do that,” Todd McLellan said — and began trying to develop cellphone apps as a senior in high school.

“Interestingly, I think we at least have to be careful not to overly emphasize cuts in production costs for 2020 when there’s at least the possibility on the horizon of a demand-driven boom due to President Trump’s dealings with China,” he said. “There is always the need — we’re in a high-volume, low-margin commodity business — and low costs often win. But it’s important not to get too bearish.
 “The good news is we’ll know within a few weeks whether this agreement is real or not. Let’s see if it falls apart before final signing. If this new trade deal is not signed, sealed and delivered sometime in January, I would be real skeptical.”
 Justin Harre of Nashville, Illinois, also doesn’t anticipate wholesale cuts. But he is looking at seed as one possible place to economize this year.
 “We’re trying to make sure we get seed costs down as much as we can, possibly planting some lower populations on corn and soybeans,” Harre said. “So far, we’re still going with the traited products. I know some guys are going with the traditional products.”
 Planting seeds stacked with multiple GMO traits may cost more on the front end. But that can also mean savings on fuel.
 “No doubt about that,” Raben said. “That helps minimize trips over the field. I think everyone can be more efficient. Put your best foot forward and you won’t have to pay out so many hours of labor.”

 Farmers likely aren’t planning to drastically reduce inputs such as fertilizer because experience has shown they lose in the long run.
 “Most have played that game before and realize that sometimes if you save a dollar, you may compromise more than that,” Cooper said.

 “We cut some fertilizer, but mainly because of timing, not because of money, just to get it in the ground,” he said. “We’re about as lean as we can possibly go.”
