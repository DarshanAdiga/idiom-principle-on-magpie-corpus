The findings were discussed at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. MSC Cruises’ Chief Business Innovation Officer Luca Pronzati participated in a panel discussion on future trends along with Peggy Fang Roe of Marriott International and Mara Winn of the Transportation Security Administration.
 Among the findings of the report:
 – Data ID Wallets will enable brands to create a seamless and hyper- personalized guest experience. Cruise ships and resorts will become data touchpoints, assessing guest behavior to better inform the services offered. And Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants and wearables will continue to play an important role in meeting the needs of guests. MSC Cruises is already leveraging voice-activated AI technology to provide a service to guests with ZOE, a virtual personal cruise assistant introduced on board in March 2019. Currently speaking seven languages, with more in development, ZOE will evolve to anticipate needs and tailor information according to each guests’ preferences.
 – Subconscious Design, where responsive technologies will seamlessly alter environments to individual guests’ moods and emotions. The cruise stateroom of the future could feature bio signal sensors that track heart rates and facial expression, adjusting light and temperature for maximum comfort. Or smart materials could act like living art, changing to create a visually immersive environment aligned with a guest’s emotional state.
 – Hyper-connectivity will drive people to seek human connection to avoid dehumanization, and entertainment will become accessible to all ages, genders and nationalities. The new Cirque du Soleil at Sea shows on MSC Cruises’ Meraviglia-class ships are non-language specific which makes them accessible to all — breaking demographic barriers and giving them universal appeal.
 – Travelers will become conscious of the environmental impact of their travel and seek out eco-friendly vacation options. The guest experience of 2030 will place a significant focus on sustainability, social impact and civic engagement.

Pawasarat also came up with the ingenious idea of studying the Village of Kohler to test the impact of two state property tax reductions for manufacturers: the machinery and equipment and the manufacturers inventory exemptions. The actual impact of these changes on individual companies had never been measured, but as the Kohler company was the the only business in the village, the record of business taxes paid was also the exact amount the company paid. And the village records showed that 75 percent of the company’s $190 million in property had been removed from the tax rolls by these two exemptions. The change helped lead to a tripling of the village’s residential property taxes.

Tottenham midfielder Moussa Sissoko is expected to be out for at least three months after undergoing knee surgery.
 The France international suffered medial collateral ligament damage in the 1-0 Premier League defeat to Southampton on January 1 and missed the 1-1 FA Cup draw with Middlesbrough last Sunday.
 Spurs expect the 30-year-old to be unable to resume training until the beginning of April.
 "Following a clinical assessment and scans, Moussa Sissoko has today (Tuesday) undergone surgery to the medial collateral ligament in his right knee," Spurs said in a statement.
 "The France international sustained the injury in our fixture against Southampton, resulting in him missing our recent FA Cup tie at Middlesbrough.
 "Our medical staff will monitor Moussa's recovery before he commences rehabilitation with a view to returning to training in early April."
 Sissoko has made 26 appearances for Spurs in all competitions this season, scoring in the league wins over Bournemouth and Burnley.
 His injury could make him a doubt for Didier Deschamps' France squad for Euro 2020, with the world champions beginning their campaign against Germany in Munich on June 16.
 The loss of Sissoko could also impact Spurs' plans during the January transfer window, with three other midfielders linked to moves away from north London.
 Christian Eriksen is reportedly a target for Inter, while Harry Winks is said to be of interest to Manchester City and Manchester United and Victor Wanyama had been expected to leave after making just four appearances all season.
 However, head coach Jose Mourinho could be reticent to let too many midfielders leave while Sissoko is unavailable, unless at least one replacement can be brought in.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn deserves up to six months behind bars, the Justice Department said Tuesday, reversing its earlier position that he was entitled to avoid prison time because of his extensive co-operation with prosecutors.
 The government's sentencing memo is a sharp rebuke to Flynn's new legal team, which for months has attacked special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and accused prosecutors of withholding information that they said was favourable to their client. A judge rejected those arguments last month.
 Prosecutors who had initially praised Flynn's co-operation said he had “retreated from his acceptance of responsibility" and “therefore is not entitled to any such credit unless he clearly and credibly disavows those statements." They asked U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan to impose a sentence of zero to six months.
 Flynn was to have been sentenced in December 2018 for lying to the FBI about his conversations with the then-Russian ambassador to the United States, including about his request that Russia not escalate tensions with the U.S. in response to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for election interference.

Florida panther road kills were down in 2019 compared to recent years, but that might not be a good thing as more road kills generally means there are more panthers roaming the Sunshine State.
   
 Twenty-seven panther deaths were documented last year by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the state agency charged with protecting endangered and threatened species.
   
 Twenty-three of those deaths were caused by vehicle collisions, down from 26 in 2018 and 24 in 2017. A record 34 panthers were killed by cars in 2016, according to FWC records.
      
 "Par for the course, perhaps a bit down summarizes things pretty well," said Dave Onorato, an FWC panther biologist.
   
 The iconic Florida panther is the official state animal with population numbers between 120 and 230 individuals, most of which live south of Lake Okeechobee and in or near Collier County.
   
 That population range was published in 2017, replacing the estimate of 100 to 180 individuals.
   
 The population had gone up, FWC said at the time, and the new numbers reflected the additional estimated cats.
   
 In recent years, as panther deaths have risen, biologists have said the increase in road kills simply means there are more panthers.
   
 More panthers on more roads with more cars equals more dead panthers.
   
 This past year was a little on the low side in regards to overall documented deaths and road kills compared to the past five years.
   
 "One year does not make a trend, but if road kills continue to decline, it would be something that would start to get our attention, given that we historically use it as a somewhat morbid indicator of trajectory of the population size," Onorato said. "... (An) increasing number of road kills coinciding with increasing number of panthers in the population and vice- versa."
   
 Lanky tan-colored cats with extremely long tails, panthers occupy the top spot of the local food chain.
   
 Amber Crooks, an environmental policy expert at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, said the numbers could be reason for concern about the future of Florida panthers.
   
 "If it's a trend, it could be telling us about the population numbers," Crooks said. "I do have a concern with the numbers -- is this telling us something troubling?"
   
 Crooks said the fewer numbers could also be partially attributed to additional wildlife crossings and road protections that have been put in place in recent years.
   
 "There have been some improvements to structures and several miles of fencing along Interstate 75, just east of the tollway on Alligator Alley," Crooks said. "But we've also had a lot more development and there is need for more landscape connectors."
   
 Females range in size from about 70 to 100 pounds, with males weighing upwards of 170 pounds, according to FWC records.
   
 Most adult cats measure between 6 and 7 feet from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail.
   
 Historically, the big cats roamed across most of the southeastern United States but were hunted to near extinction decades ago.
   
 Panthers are occasionally found north of the lake and even as far away as Georgia.
   
 Getting breeding females to travel north of the Caloosahatchee River is a major roadblock, although a female and kittens were documented north of the river in recent years.
   
 The Florida panther is the only population of cougars living east of the Mississippi River, and it's protected by federal and state laws.
   
 Restoration plans include growing the number of cats to three separate populations of at least 240 individuals.
   
 The second and third populations would likely be located outside of Florida, researchers and biologists working with panther recovery have said.
   
 Loss of hunting and breeding habitat is the top threat to the panther recovery, according to biologists.
   
 Panthers numbered as few as two dozen in the 1990s, when a group of Texas cougars were introduced to the historic Everglades in order to increase the genetic diversity of Florida's cats.
   
 That program worked as the population south of Lake Okeechobee has rebounded, but some panther experts and advocacy groups think the region may be at capacity when it comes to suitable panther habitat.
