Yeah, the first thing, I would. And then, I'm going to ask Neil and or anyone else who may have a comment on the call. I want to reinforce to investors something I've been saying all along, I think that FSGS, I think the company started work here before I came on board and I think we did the absolute right thing going after proteinuric kidney disease, where patients currently, to some degree, are getting utilization of first-generation CNIs. We know that today and it made a lot of sense. I can tell you just from an investment standpoint, that this was sort of an off NPV or IRR body of work that the company was going down. It was an exploratory study. We knew from the outset, our estimate was that there were about 4,000 to 5,000 patients here. And that, if we were to get the drug approved in lupus nephritis, that the pricing of the drug would be would be priced relative to the lupus nephritis market, what we believe much larger market opportunity. So, pricing accordingly.

In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to federal investigators about his contacts with former Russian ambassador to the U.S Sergey Kislyak after the election and before Mr. Trump took office. But in January, Flynn asked the federal district court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, pointing to the government's "bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement."
 The request from Flynn comes as a newly declassified email from Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, shows former FBI Director James Comey was concerned about Flynn's discussions with Kislyak but didn't believe Flynn shared classified information with the Russian envoy. The full text of the email was declassified by the Trump administration and obtained by CBS's Herridge on Tuesday.
 Rice sent an email to herself on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017, detailing a meeting held in the Oval Office two weeks prior about the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling and Flynn. Present for the meeting were Mr. Obama, then-Vice President Joe Biden, Comey, Rice and then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates.
 According to Rice's newly-declassified account of the meeting, Comey "affirmed that he is proceeding 'by the book' as it relates to law enforcement."
 "From a national security perspective, Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kisylak," Rice wrote in the email she sent to herself. "Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information.  President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn. Comey replied 'potentially.'  He added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kisylak, but he noted that 'the level of communication is unusual.'"

Connie Mendel, Louisville Metro Public Health Deputy Director.LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - The 2020 Memorial Day weekend could be the break many have been looking for to get away from the monotony of staying at home. But taking the fun outside does not mean leaving your cares behind. Health officials say approach outings with appropriate caution.“I would say avoid public restrooms if you can,” Connie Mendel, Louisville Metro Public Health Deputy Director said. “Avoid surfaces that are frequently touched like the park benches and unfortunately the playground equipment. You want to avoid those things.”The rules of washing your hands, social distancing, using hand sanitizer and not touching your face still apply even if you are outdoors.The dilemma is finding a way to be out in public while avoiding public contact.The coronavirus is spread most often by coughing and sneezing. The open air dilutes droplets that could contain the virus and sunlight can kill it. But staying too close to too many people for too long still raises the risk of transmission.If you are planning a picnic in a public park, Louisville Metro health officials say to wipe down the table and don't share utensils, food or drinks with others.“We still want to stay 6 feet away from anyone who is not in your household,” Mendel said. “When you can’t, you absolutely want to use face coverings or masks and maintain that six feet of distance. So if you’re out and about this weekend in the parks or the Great Lawn and the Big Four Bridge, if it’s crowded I would say avoid it and come back later.”The rules of washing your hands, social distancing, using hand sanitizer and not touching your face still apply even if you are outdoors.If you are planning a picnic in a public park, Mendel said wipe down the table, don’t share utensils, food or drinks.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

Suddenly, millions of Americans are realizing how hard it is to get help in an emergency and how our safety net is full of holes. The truth is it has always been hard to get substantive assistance when life hands you lemons. People struck with a disability, unemployment, mental illness, relocation, or simply old age, have reported for decades that getting any form of assistance in this country means swallowing a big dose of indifference, shame and injustice.
 My clients in New Orleans in the late 1960s introduced me to the reality that people who work in programs set up to help people often saw it as their duty to judge and punish when making decisions about a client’s worthiness to receive help. Things like letting a phone ring unanswered, placing the Aged and Disabled intake office in a location without public transportation and up a flight of stairs, having no translators, rescheduling appointments in order to delay benefits, were all acknowledged ways of reducing caseloads and punishing clients they didn’t like.
 Throughout the 243 years of America’s existence, we have not been able to shake the belief that people cause their own problems, that good people do not have bad things happen to them, and that people do not deserve to get something for nothing. Many believe that even a small amount of help should have strings attached and doing something for someone requires something in return.
 In these past weeks, many first timers have come face to face with a bureaucratic morass. The assistance they have always assumed “other people” were getting really does not exist or is greatly limited. Real help is slow in coming, short in duration and always comes with strings attached. No wonder people want to go back to work. It is not pleasant living with insecurity, asking for help and feeling powerless. It is one thing to be against government handouts for other people, but we don’t feel that should include my aunt, your husband, my cousin or ourselves. These past weeks of unanswered messages, interminable waits on the telephone, crashed websites and the check is in the mail may be the first realization for some people that Americans believe it is unacceptable to be unemployed, to be disabled, to have special needs or to be financially desperate so we greatly limit their options. No one cares if assistance programs are slow, out of date, mismanaged, underfunded or undermanned because there is something wrong with those people who need those benefits anyway.
 The Democratic Party has tried in many ways over many years to address and override this culture of shame. We believe, and these are my words, that people fall on hard times mostly due to accidents of birth, unavoidable economic changes, disasters of all sizes and the great unfairness of life itself. We really believe in the phrase “through no fault of their own”. We believe no one person is better or more worthy than another and each person has his life to live and society should provide ways to nourish that life. We believe that public education for all is not just important but of paramount importance to the economic and social health of a nation. We have championed unions, civil rights, fair and equal pay, reasonable immigration procedures, public education, healthcare for all and world peace. We have proposed and passed hundreds of laws, statutes and programs to improve the quality of life and the dignity of those who were born with challenges or who fell upon hard times. We will not stop trying to eradicate the attitude that some people are worth more than others. That some people contribute more than others. And that some contributions are more worthy than others. We Democrats are diverse, opinionated, emotional, and often impractical.
 We consider ourselves optimists, and we do not seem to mind learning from adversity. Our successes have been at times astronomical and our failures more than dismal. Rolling with the punches is one of our mottoes and we do not believe this pandemic will keep America down if we get behind leaders who are smart, hardworking and swift. Now that many millions of Americans have walked in the shoes of the unemployed, uninsured and food insecure, maybe we can see our way to fixing programs that do not work as they should. There is a chance that we will realize that we do not get through catastrophes like this by blaming one group of people or by allowing one group to die while others thrive. I still believe a fair and just world is achievable, but we need new leadership. We need empathy and compassion restored to our way of life.
 The place to start is registering to vote and turning out the vote in November.

 WARREN, ME - Will Kraus, born on July 28, 1977, passed away unexpectedly on April 26 at his home in Warren, Maine. Will is survived by his adoring family, his father, Richard and his wife Lynn Kraus of West Barnstable, his mother, Eliza Petrovits of Maine, sister Arleigh Kraus and her partner Jeff Spear of Warren, Maine, brother Daniel Kraus of West Barnstable, and his beloved niece and nephews, Sophia, Taj, and Ulysses of Warren, Maine. He is also survived by his aunts and uncles, Karen and Edgar Davignon, Lexy, Noni, Tina, Genie and Mike, Valerie and Mark Petrovits, and many cousins. He also leaves behind many very special friends who will all miss his infectious smile, great laugh and quiet sensitivity. Will also loved animals and was pre-deceased by his two cherished dogs, Booker and Oden, who spent endless happy hours with their devoted owner.
 Will grew up on Cape Cod attending schools in Barnstable, Sandwich and Dennis- Yarmouth. Will was extremely intelligent and a master of words, as anyone who ever played Scrabble with him knows. He also excelled in art and was recruited to attend some very prestigious art colleges. Instead Will chose to spend his life on and around the ocean, which was his passion. He loved to surf and fish and spent many waking hours in and around the water. His job as field crew manager at Aquaculture Research Corporation in Dennis was right up his alley working the shellfish flats in Wellfleet and Barnstable growing and harvesting clams and oysters.
 On and off the water, Will was a Jack of all trades, and knew how to fix anything that needed fixing. These skills also made him the perfect partner for his sister in their agriculture business in Warren, Maine, where he moved in 2014.
 As a youngster Will was an avid hockey player and excelled as a defenseman for the Boston Metro League. He was also an excellent baseball player and played in the Cape Cod Little League. Will had a love of speed and mechanical things that moved. His adventurous side often ended with some kind of injury and trip to the hospital.
 Anyone who has ever met Will has only great things to say about him. He was humble and selfless, always putting others before himself and willing to help anyone. He loved to make people laugh and played many pranks on friends and coworkers to keep things fun and lighthearted. But mostly people gravitated toward him because of his genuine unassuming kind and gentle spirit. He had a huge capacity to care for people and his large build could barely contain the enormity of his heart and soul.
 Family and friends will gather to memorialize Will's life at a later date when it is safe to be together. Donations may be made in his name to the MSPCA.

ATLANTA (AP) — Evangelist Ravi Zacharias, who built an international ministry that strives to defend Christianity on intellectual grounds, has died in Georgia. He was 74.Zacharias died Tuesday at his home in Atlanta after a brief battle with sarcoma, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries said in a statement.The Rev. Billy Graham invited Zacharias to preach at the inaugural International Conference for Itinerant Evangelists in Amsterdam in 1983, the organization said.He rose to prominence as a defender of the “intellectual credibility” of Christianity, the ministry said.The ministry's mission is “helping the thinker believe and the believer think," it said in announcing the death of Zacharias.Zacharias “saw the objections and questions of others not as something to be rebuffed, but as a cry of the heart that had to be answered,” Michael Ramsden, the ministry's president, said in a statement.In an emotional video message, professional athlete Tim Tebow asked for prayers for Zacharias' family and ministry.“So I think it’s really important in life to have heroes and especially in the faith, and one of my heroes in the faith is a man named Ravi Zacharias," Tebow said in a video posted on Instagram.“Ravi has inspired me and millions of people around the world," added Tebow, who won college football's Heisman Trophy in 2007 and is known for being outspoken on and off the field about his Christian faith.“It was his Savior, Jesus Christ, that my dad always wanted most to talk about,” said his daughter Sarah Davis, CEO of the ministry.“Even in his final days, until he lacked the energy and breath to speak, he turned every conversation to Jesus and what the Lord had done," she said. “He perpetually marveled that God took a 17-year-old skeptic, defeated in hopelessness and unbelief, and called him into a life of glorious hope and belief in the truth of Scripture — a message he would carry across the globe for 48 years.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Tom Hanks is joining the ranks of stars premiering movies on streaming services during the pandemic, but he's not going to one of the usual outlets. Deadline reports that Hanks is premiering his WWII naval drama Greyhound on Apple TV+, making it Apple's largest movie project to date. The tech firm hasn't announced a release date, although Greyhound was was originally slated to debut on Father's Day weekend (the weekend of June 19th) through Sony Pictures. It's safe to say you won't see it in movie theaters when many are likely to remain closed even as lockdowns lift.Hanks wrote the movie and plays an officer who takes command of a Navy destroyer during the early days of WWII, when the US had formed an alliance with the UK to deliver critical resources for the fight against Germany. Apple was apparently quite serious about the deal. Deadline claims there was a fierce bidding war between streamers, and Apple clinched the rights somewhere in the "$70 million range."It's not certain if Apple will continue on a path like this, but the company has been gradually stepping up its commitment to feature-length projects. Apart from the Samuel L. Jackson-starring The Banker, the Apple TV+ movie lineup has so far focused on documentaries like Beastie Boys Story. The highlight of its upcoming movie calendar has so far been Sofia Coppola's On the Rocks, starring Bill Murray and Rashida Jones. Greyhound goes one step beyond -- it's not only featuring an A-list star, it's a title that would otherwise have gone to the competition (or faced a delayed theatrical release).

Obviously, Q1 wasn't fully burdened by the full SG&A costs. So we'll have a slight increase as you kind of look out into the future quarters associated with that. Obviously, the remainder of the year, we'll have quite a bit of MD&A preparation costs. So, you'll have somewhat of the shift between kind of your peer development cost into more of your kind of CMC and NDA cost. But overall, I think your R&D expenses should remain pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. I'd say, if you use Q1 as kind of your benchmark, you may have a slight increase in the coming quarters. But you could probably use Q1 with a little bit of an uptick to kind of project what the remainder of the year will look like.

The parks will open at some point down the road, and when they do, they'll be opened to limited capacity, though by no means a small number of people. People will almost certainly be expected to wear masks, something which is already being met with backlash. The question isn't "Will there be confrontations with guests over masks?" The question is only "How many will there be?" Social distancing measures are sure to be in effect in places where crowds of various sizes are expected.

While you may be reading this online on Tuesday or in the paper on Wednesday, I am writing this on Friday just a few hours before reopening the PumpHouse Riverside Restaurant and Bar at 25% capacity.
 In large measure, the restaurant will open to an unknown market with policies and procedures that are foreign to the staff and customers alike. These conditions are by no means unique to the PumpHouse. Every restaurant throughout the country is challenged with planning and adapting to circumstances and constraints imposed by government, the supply chain, and the market demands.
 I thought readers might be interested in taking a brief look behind the scenes of what it takes to reopen a restaurant in a world that is so different today compared to the day we closed some two months ago.
 The health and safety of the staff and customers is our primary concern. I feel certain that every restaurant feels the same. Before any staff member can clock in, a symptom checklist must be completed and signed. Then their temperature will be checked and recorded. Anyone with either a symptom or an elevated temperature will be sent home. All staff members must wear masks and, where appropriate, gloves. Hand sanitizer is readily available and frequent hand washing is required.
 A restaurant has many, many moving parts which, in our case, involves a large staff. Before committing to a reopening date, it was imperative to get an understanding of which members of the staff were ready to come back. I am thrilled to say that our entire kitchen staff was chomping at the bit and with the exception of wearing masks, their activities are relatively unchanged. A reduced customer load allows for fewer staff in the kitchen to be present at any one time. That said, the staff that is not occupied cooking on the line, is occupied by cleaning, re-cleaning and cleaning again.
 The front of the house is a different matter altogether. Great servers are a gregarious bunch. I suspect they will feel challenged by the need to wear masks, making communication a little more challenging. Servers are used to a very fast pace and the occupancy restrictions are going to slow that pace considerably. Consistent social distancing is something that we must be vigilant on enforcing.
 The customer experience will feel a little foreign too. By mandate, we can’t have flowers, or anything for that matter, on the tables. Silverware will be delivered to the table by a host or hostess. The silverware will have been wrapped in a heavy disposable napkin. Once the silverware has been cleaned, it will not be touched by a human hand before the customer receives it. It will be rolled by a member of the restaurant staff wearing gloves and mask at all time.
 Gone are the days of Tabasco bottles, catsup bottles, sugar/sweetener caddies, and salt and pepper shakers. Every condiment will be single serve. The menus also are different. Once a menu has been given to a guest and the order placed, the menu is destroyed. Three of every four tables and chairs have been removed from the inside dining area and it feels, to me, a little eerily vacant.
 Restrooms will be attended and only one guest at a time will be admitted. Once the guest leaves the restroom, the attendant will sanitize the area before another guest can come in. This should be fun.
 Food purchases for a restaurant were almost automatic. Availability was unquestioned and prices were relatively stable. That is not the case at this time. Some products, particularly beef, have seen staggering price escalation and questions about availability. This is painful for our rancher friends who are seeing record low prices for cattle and consumers who must pay record high prices. Covid-19 has brought the processing plants to their knees and it will take some time to recover. Pork has seen some increases but supplies are stable. Chicken and seafood have remained stable, but as consumers demand reasonable plate costs, increased demand for chicken and seafood will drive those prices up.
 Restaurants may address these price escalations by reducing portion sizes or the quality of the products or by amending prices. Everyone has a different way of dealing with the cost situation.
 We have decided to maintain both the quality and size of our dishes, while at the same time we have challenged our chef and cooks to innovate, by creating new dishes on a regular basis. We have partnered with the best food service providers who keep us abreast of market trends and alert us to pricing and availability changes. We must be constantly aware and ready to seize opportunities as they are presented. A critical component of our ability to adapt and innovate is our relationship with our food service companies. I can’t say enough good things about them.
 It’s now two hours before we open and I can feel my blood pressure creeping up. I know the stress I feel now will evaporate when we see our old friends walk back in our doors. Be safe and God Bless.

TORONTO — Major League Soccer has cancelled its 2020 all-star game as well as the Leagues Cup and Campeones Cup.
 The all-star game, pitting MLS all-stars against their Mexican league counterparts, was scheduled for July 29 at the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles.
 The second edition of the Leagues Cup, a tournament featuring MLS and Liga MX teams, was slated to run between July and September. The third edition of the Campeones Cup was scheduled for Aug. 12 in Seattle between the MLS champion Sounders and Mexican league winner.
 ML said the games were cancelled "to provide the most available dates for the remainder of the year for league competition."
 The league said all three marquee events will return in 2021.
 MLS suspended play on March 12, two weeks into the 2020 season, due to the global pandemic. Teams have begun individual voluntary outdoor workouts at their training facilities amidst reports the league is looking to play games out of a central hub, possibly in the Orlando area, later in the summer.
 The league said the 2021 MLS all-star game will take place in Los Angeles at the same venue with "every expectation" that MLS and Liga MX all-stars will face off.
 MLS also said it was reviewing proposals from three cities to host the 2022 all-star game.

WASHINGTON (AP) " Restaurant owners gave President Donald Trump a sobering accounting of the widespread damage the coronavirus pandemic has dealt their industry and asked him to adjust a loan program for small businesses to address their concerns. The president put a hopeful spin on the situation, saying encouraging news on vaccines and treatment efforts could 'negate' the bad news.
 The president was in good spirits as he met Monday with the restaurant executives at the White House, noting that financial markets were up as states continued to loosen economic restrictions on businesses and following Moderna Inc.'s announcement of encouraging news in early work on vaccine development.
 'This was a very big day, therapeutically, cure-wise and vaccine-wise,' Trump said. 'Tremendous progress has been made, as I've been saying for two weeks, because I've been seeing what's going on and have been spearheading it largely."
 'It almost feels like today is the first day," Trump said at another point in the meeting. 'Last week didn't feel the same. Now it feels good. People are starting to go out. They're opening. They get it.'
 Restaurant owners said they appreciated that the government had acted swiftly on assistance efforts, but cautioned that even opening up to more customers would not necessarily mean a return to profits because they'll be serving fewer customers.
 They called for extending the eight-week period in which they must spend their Paycheck Protection Program loans in order to have the loans forgiven. An extension to 24 weeks would give them more time to adjust to the new customer constraints they face as states place limits on how many people can dine at restaurants.
 'We rely on social interaction so it makes us really unique that we were hit hard quickly, and it's going to make our comeback really difficult,' said Melvin Rodrigue, president and chief executive of Galatoire's Restaurant in New Orleans.
 Rodrigue told Trump he was 'glad to hear your news" about vaccines, prompting Trump to respond: 'My news negates what you just said because you would be back into business like you had it " no seats lost.'
 The House passed legislation last week as part of another economic rescue package that allows employers to use the Paycheck Protection Program over 24 weeks, but the White House and Trump have been highly critical of the overall bill.
 The National Restaurant Association reports that sales at food and drink businesses fell in April to their lowest level in more than 35 years, when adjusting for inflation. Sales came in at $32.4 billion, about half the level from just two months earlier.
 Trump has consistently raised hopes and expectations for treatments and a vaccine, even as some of his counterparts around the globe remain cautious.
 "So I'm very happy, and the market's up very big,' Trump said earlier in the day at another White House meeting. He added that he thought the economy would soar as quickly as it fell in recent months, sometimes referred to as a V-shaped recovery. 'I think you're going to have a V. I think it's going to be terrific.'
 Trump's remarks follow Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the economy may need more help.
 'The coronavirus shock is also the biggest shock that the economy's had in living memory,' Powell said on CBS' '60 Minutes.' 'And the question is, will it be enough? And I don't think we know the answer to that. It may well be that the Fed has to do more. It may be that Congress has to do more. And the reason we've got to do more is to avoid longer-run damage to the economy.'
 Senior adviser Kevin Hassett said the White House is in a 'wait-and-see mode' on whether the country needs more help from the federal government.
 'It's been really encouraging to see how quickly businesses around the country have begun to ramp up,' Hassett told reporters.
 Trump met with restaurant owners and executives in the afternoon. He again called for companies to be able to fully deduct business meals in restaurants and for other entertainment expenses.
 'That's going to create a tremendous amount of business. I think you're going to have to open a lot of additional restaurants in this country," Trump told the executives.

 The reopening of Ontario's economy during the COVID-19 pandemic will have to be done slowly and will require new thinking, business and industry organizations say.
 "What the economy cannot afford, and what the psyche of Canadians can't afford, is to be forced back into total lockdown because we can't control the virus," said Ontario Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Rocco Rossi. "
 The province began its first major reopening phase Tuesday, allowing all construction to resume as well as stores with street-front entrances to reopen with restrictions.
 Many other businesses remain closed for now and still reliant on government aid packages to get by. On Tuesday, the federal government announced an expansion to the eligibility criteria for its small-business loan program to businesses that don't have payroll, such as those that employ contractors.
 A survey prepared for the Chamber of Commerce, as well as for the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and Ontario General Contractors Association, shows that 88 per cent of Ontarians are worried about the economy and 75 per cent are worried about contracting COVID-19.
 The Chamber of Commerce said the results, released Tuesday, show that the economy and the health of Ontarians are interdependent and must be addressed together.
 Rossi said elements that are critical to boosting the confidence of consumers and employees include expanding testing, contact tracing and access to personal protective equipment for businesses of all sizes.
 "No one can promise zero additional infections and zero additional deaths, so long as we have no vaccine," said Rossi.
 "What we can and must assure employees and consumers is that there will be zero tolerance for incompetence; that every step that can be taken will be taken to provide for safe and secure establishments, whether they be factories or retail outlets."
 Operating in an environment where COVID-19 remains a risk is at the heart of work being led by the Toronto Region Board of Trade.
 The organization released a report titled "Reimagining Recovery" last week. Six working groups, including senior leaders from a variety of sectors with collaboration from the city, are focusing on "priority working tracks" for a successful reopening.
 That means looking at everything from recovery timelines for different sectors to expanding the use of digital commerce to retrofitting the needs of businesses.
 "Main street, airports, mass transit, major event spaces, commercial spaces, shopping malls -- there's action we need to take now to ready-proof all these community spaces for our three-stage recovery," says the report.
 The report outlines the three-stage recovery as a managed return, a pre- vaccine return and a post-vaccine return, with toggling between the different stages should new outbreaks arise.
 "When we started this in early March, many of us were thinking that we just needed to wait until it was over and we could go back to normal," said Board of Trade president and CEO Jan De Silva.
 "The reality is we're going to have to learn how to normalize activities with COVID still existing. So this (framework) is thinking through all the elements that will need to be addressed and make sure we've got resources supporting them."
 Aside from retail, one of the other big sectors affected by this week's reopening is construction, which sounded the alarm at the beginning of the pandemic about lack of protection from potential outbreaks at work sites.
 Phil Gillies, executive director of the Ontario Construction Consortium, told the Star Tuesday that things are better now, but some measures implemented by the province during the pandemic -- including more frequent inspections -- must remain in place permanently.
 A major concern remains physical distancing to limit the potential spread of the virus.
 "The reality is that in all likelihood, it's going to take longer to build a typical project if all these safety measures are being adhered to and it's going to impact on price, so these measures have to be factored into the tender process," Gillies said.
 The Ford government announced Tuesday that schools will be closed for the rest of the school year, which will keep many workers at home and likely affect just how quickly the province's economy can fully reopen.
 "I think that does somewhat constrain the extent to which the economy can rebound, that's the reality of the situation," said BMO chief economist Doug Porter.
 "Folks might eventually figure out a way to deal with the situation, but it does definitely add a layer of uncertainty into how the economy can recover."

WARREN, ME - Will Kraus, born on July 28, 1977, passed away unexpectedly on April 26 at his home in Warren, Maine. Will is survived by his adoring family, his father, Richard and his wife Lynn Kraus of West Barnstable, his mother, Eliza Petrovits of Maine, sister Arleigh Kraus and her partner Jeff Spear of Warren, Maine, brother Daniel Kraus of West Barnstable, and his beloved niece and nephews, Sophia, Taj, and Ulysses of Warren, Maine. He is also survived by his aunts and uncles, Karen and Edgar Davignon, Lexy, Noni, Tina, Genie and Mike, Valerie and Mark Petrovits, and many cousins. He also leaves behind many very special friends who will all miss his infectious smile, great laugh and quiet sensitivity. Will also loved animals and was pre-deceased by his two cherished dogs, Booker and Oden, who spent endless happy hours with their devoted owner.
 Will grew up on Cape Cod attending schools in Barnstable, Sandwich and Dennis- Yarmouth. Will was extremely intelligent and a master of words, as anyone who ever played Scrabble with him knows. He also excelled in art and was recruited to attend some very prestigious art colleges. Instead Will chose to spend his life on and around the ocean, which was his passion. He loved to surf and fish and spent many waking hours in and around the water. His job as field crew manager at Aquaculture Research Corporation in Dennis was right up his alley working the shellfish flats in Wellfleet and Barnstable growing and harvesting clams and oysters.
 On and off the water, Will was a Jack of all trades, and knew how to fix anything that needed fixing. These skills also made him the perfect partner for his sister in their agriculture business in Warren, Maine, where he moved in 2014.
 As a youngster Will was an avid hockey player and excelled as a defenseman for the Boston Metro League. He was also an excellent baseball player and played in the Cape Cod Little League. Will had a love of speed and mechanical things that moved. His adventurous side often ended with some kind of injury and trip to the hospital.
 Anyone who has ever met Will has only great things to say about him. He was humble and selfless, always putting others before himself and willing to help anyone. He loved to make people laugh and played many pranks on friends and coworkers to keep things fun and lighthearted. But mostly people gravitated toward him because of his genuine unassuming kind and gentle spirit. He had a huge capacity to care for people and his large build could barely contain the enormity of his heart and soul.
 Family and friends will gather to memorialize Will's life at a later date when it is safe to be together. Donations may be made in his name to the MSPCA.

"He's getting all kinds of attention," Lambert head coach Tommy Watson said. "There's still some schools out there that he's really interested in that he's always wanted to be a part of. You know, he tells me those schools and those things and I reach out to them for him. I'll tell you one thing, I'm glad he's on our team."
 Meanwhile, West Forsyth junior Dylan Fairchild saw his recruiting take off earlier in the school year, allowing him to carve out a top-six list, which he announced a couple of weeks ago.
 In fact, Fairchild was offered by Alabama head coach Nick Saban on May 7, though the Crimson Tide failed to make the cut.
 A couple of Shor's teammates at Denmark, quarterback Aaron McLaughlin and defensive back Justin Bradford, even committed last week, with McLaughlin picking NC State and Bradford choosing Troy.
 College coaches are getting creative with how they coax top prospects, from making sure their staff stays in constant contact with recruits to offering those players virtual tours.
 "I've actually had a couple of virtual tours with TCU," Shor said. "So, that's the only college I've gone on a virtual tour with. As far as I know, they're not letting high school prospects on campus (until) around September."
 Shor said the TCU coaching staff took him on a virtual tour of the football complex, showing off the school's practice field, indoor facility and weight room.
 "It's been kind of funky, because we're not allowed to go on campus or to camps and all that stuff, but I've been calling coaches every week," Shor said. "I mean, that's the usual. They can't call me yet because I'm just a sophomore, but I've been calling a lot of coaches every week."
 Florida State posted a 2 1/2 minute virtual tour to YouTube last month, beginning with a message from the school's director of on-campus recruiting, before panning over to show campus hotspots such as players' housing, football facilities and Doak Campbell Stadium.
 It offers a glimpse at campus life, which is traditionally a strong selling point for many universities. So, in a time when in-person recruiting is halted, the virtual tours offer prospects some sort of on-campus experience.
 Still, coaches are anxious to get prospects on campus for not only visits but also camps, which allow for exclusive looks at on-field ability.
 Until then?
 "There's not much they can do, really," Shor said. "Honestly, at this point, just playing it by ear when things start to get back to normal. But, you know, we're still waiting on that at this point. Hopefully, this stuff ends pretty soon and I can start getting the visits and all that good stuff."

Since announcing the interim agreement with Covid on April 20, 2020, the Company has been completing diligence on Covid, the personal protection equipment (“PPE”) industry and anticipated demand for PPE. The Company is of the view that the demand for PPE will increase in the future as Canadian and worldwide economies, education and securities re-open. The anticipated demand for PPE the Company believes will transcend the current need arising from the pandemic and will become a requirement of the “new normal”. Covid has established manufacturing capacity through the acquisition of state of the art mask making equipment, including the purchase of a FLK120 surgical mask making machine and over 5 tonnes of raw material for mask production. Covid has additional cash and manufacturing assets having a replacement value of approximately $500,000. Since the interim agreement, Covid has entered into purchase agreements for approximately 1 million masks to private enterprise.

If a primary care physician that normally sees patients in-person switches to a telehealth model and maintains that regularity, he/she may be able to keep up with the same continuity of care with their long-term patients. However, LTRs can’t always be assumed with new, emerging models of telehealth. Many new mobile telehealth applications that focus on connecting a patient with a physician immediately place value on speed and convenience, and may simply connect the patient with the next available provider, rather than a known physician. Though this model may be appropriately prioritized in certain situations and may indeed be an extremely useful and valuable addition to the healthcare landscape, society cannot afford to forget the millennia-old importance of patient-physician LTR’s. This would be an immense disservice to a very critical part of the art of practicing medicine: cultivating a deep understanding of the patient, so physicians can curate their care not only based on disease, but also cater to the patient’s social, economic, and mental needs.

Ronald L. Cole      Greensboro, GA - Ronald L. Cole of Greensboro, Georgia passed away on May 14 at the age of 74. He spent his final days looking out on the lake he loved and being doted on by his children, grandchildren, sons-in-law and wife of fifty- two years.      Ron was born on September 22, 1945 in Shelbyville, Indiana, one of thirteen children born to Grace and Earl Leon Cole. As the sixth child and first boy, he anointed himself the family prince and dreamed up devilish ways to torment his sisters. He "collected" their doll heads and disrupted their dates, flashing the porch lights when anyone leaned in for a good-night kiss. It was the beginning of a life-long love of pranks and competition.      Growing up Ron excelled at just about everything, winning a statewide free- throw contest, and awards like Outstanding Boy of the Year and the coveted Paul Cross Award for achievement in basketball, citizenship and academics. He was student body president and one of the first alumni inducted into the Shelbyville High School Hall of Fame.      Ron studied mathematics on an academic scholarship at Franklin College and was elected president of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. But the highlight of his time at Franklin was saying yes to a blind date with Lynda Esposito, a brown- eyed beauty from New Jersey who would say "I do" just eleven months later.      After graduating cum laude from Franklin and a stint teaching high school, Ron answered a want ad for a position at Reader's Digest in New York. He got the job and rose up the ranks to become president and CEO of its Canadian operation and worldwide publisher of the magazine. He attended Harvard Business School and did business in Japan, South Africa and more than a dozen countries in between. Despite the long trips and hours, his priorities were clear: when his daughters had a concert or basketball game, he was there. He also set aside plenty of time to convince the girls' friends that he was, in fact, the real Ronald McDonald.      His work brought chances to live in Montreal and Madrid and compete in enough golf tournaments to become a fierce player with five hole-in-one plaques on the wall. It should be noted that his patience on the fairway only went so far, particularly when he teed off with his daughters or sons-in-law. The words "why don't you pick up the ball and throw it" might have slipped out more than once.      Giving back was important to Ron. He was generous with everyone in his personal and professional life. He volunteered at Ken Venturi's Guiding Eyes for the Blind and served on the board of the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club, a branch of an organization that helped shape his ambitions as a teen.      After retiring, leaving Chappaqua, NY and settling in Georgia in 1998, he traveled with Lynda, perfected a killer gin martini for his mother-in-law, completed every New York Times crossword puzzle and played even more golf. He collected a closetful of impractical gadgets and spent hours studying their instruction manuals. But mostly, he found ways to dote on his "queen" Lynda and share the prankster code with his five grandchildren. On holidays you might find him in the attic, tied up in Christmas lights for an Elf on the Shelf routine or crafting a tinfoil pole to celebrate Festivus.      At the last full meal with his family, his children and grandchildren shared their favorite jokes and stories from their time together. As the meal ended his final words summed up the evening and a life, "That was special. Thank you."      Ron is missed by his wife Lynda; daughters Elizabeth and Catherine; grandchildren Sarah, Matthew, Charlie, Elizabeth and Emilia; sons-in-law Christian and Doug; brothers-in-law Richard and Robert; sisters Shirley, Beverly, Denie, Faye, Jackie, Christie, Beth, Sherri and Julie. He is predeceased by parents, Grace and Earl Leon, and siblings Gregg, Todd and Betty.      A memorial will be held at a later date. Memorial contributions may be made in Ron's name at J. Ken Self Shelby County Boys & Girls Club, P.O. Box 57, Shelbyville, IN 46176 or The Cancer Foundation, PO Box 49309, Athens, GA 30604 or www.cfnega.org. McCommons Funeral Home, 109 W. Broad St., Greensboro, GA, (706) 453-2626, is in charge of arrangements. Visit us at www.mccommonsfuneralhome.com to sign the online guest register.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Elizabeth Hubbart was booked for a cruise that followed the path of Lewis and Clark’s expedition in the Pacific Northwest. Joel Demski was set to watch and cheer his grandson graduating from the Naval Academy. James Kelly planned a trip to Scotland, to scatter his father’s ashes in the Clyde River near Glasgow.
 They are all older than 60. And like millions of others, they now face the painful realization that their plans, their hopes, their bucket-list items, were not simply deferred but in many cases denied thanks to the coronavirus.
 The global pandemic has left them wondering about the time they have left, and how to spend those moments when movement is severely limited. Instead of taking in the Seven Wonders of the World or making family memories, many are worried about the mundane, like whether it’s safe to grocery shop or even go outdoors.
 Guilt, anger and frustration seep in, with all this precious time lost.
 “One less year is one less trip,” said 72-year-old Bob Busch, an avid traveler from Sarasota, Florida who canceled a 35-day camping trip with his wife. They are healthy this year, but what about in the future, after the pandemic has passed? “How many times can you hook up the trailer and head west?”
 Demski, who lives in Vero Beach, Florida, was crestfallen when the Naval Academy canceled its graduation ceremonies. Instead of taking in the celebration in Annapolis with his grandson, he is left with concern as the young man ships out on his assignment. Plans to see another grandson graduate from UCLA in California have also been scrapped.
 “I’m really just sad. It’s sadness for the whole country,” said Demski, who is a few months shy of his 80th birthday.
 Mick Smyer, a psychology professor at Bucknell University who studies aging and the elderly, said the Baby Boom generation is among the first to have additional years of vitality. This pandemic is hitting in the middle of their generation’s “developmental task,” which, as the American Psychological Association defines it, is “the fundamental physical, social, intellectual, and emotional achievements and abilities that must be acquired at each stage of life for normal and healthy development.”
 In other words, boomers are feeling their mortality. As headlines blare about elders being more susceptible to dying of Coronavirus, the healthy wonder: Will I be able to achieve, see, and do everything I wanted out of life?
 “Boomers are thinking back about whether it has it been a good life, and what was it all about,” he said. “Now there are fewer options in the near term. The next two years are off the table, and how many good years are left?”
 Kelly, a 63-year-old psychologist, also plays guitar and writes country rock and Americana songs. Lately, he’s been pondering his fate as he sits alone in his Atlanta home, thinking about when he’ll be able to bring his father’s ashes to his native Scotland.
 “My most recent songs have been about aging. Dealing with life and loss. The road behind and the road ahead, about how much is behind me and how little is in front of me.”
 “There’s not a lot more road in front of me,” he recently wrote in a song lyric.
 At the same time, many acknowledge that their sacrifices are also a product of privilege. Millions of people who are unemployed or working in essential, yet low-wage jobs, don’t have that luxury now — or possibly ever.
 “Some of my emotion, in all honesty, is guilt,” said Judy Forman, a 70-year- old from Flourtown, Pennsylvania. “We’re inconvenienced and we’re scared and we’re able to handle it. I try to help as much as I can. When I get a food order, I leave a huge tip. I give to food pantries.”
 But the feeling that time is slipping away grates on her. She can’t travel to visit one of her daughters in California. She can’t even hug her three grandsons, who live across the street.
 “It’s depression, loneliness. It’s boredom. Fear. Mostly fear.” She spends hours wiping down groceries, sanitizing doorknobs, thinking about how the future will be permanently different from now on.
 “I do all this because I don’t want to die. So yeah, I’m feeling my mortality,” she said in a quiet voice.
 Helen Miltiades, a professor of gerontology at Fresno State in California, said older adults are struggling in ways younger folks aren’t.
 “The whole phrase ‘the new normal.’ People are using that, but what does that mean? People make jokes about it. That’s a way of coping with change without really understanding what the change entails. I don’t think we have that figured out yet.”
 Hubbart, who was supposed to go on the cruise with her husband, canceled that. The 70-year-old Miami resident is holding onto a shred of hope that she can see Hugh Jackman — her favorite actor — on Broadway this fall, but she’s prepared for disappointment.
 “This was supposed to be my decade,” she said. “And it’s going to be very different than I expected.”
 Dena Davis is more optimistic. She’s a 73-year-old professor of bioethics at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. She has postponed her sabbatical because of the pandemic and figures her plans for retirement have been pushed back.
 “If you’re lucky, the reason there isn’t that much more time is because you’ve already had a lot of time. … It depends on the way you look at it,” she said. “I’m not seeing endless vistas in front of me. There are pretty big vistas behind me. You can’t have it both ways.”

U.S. oil prices continued rising early on Tuesday morning, the day on which the June contract expires, before falling slightly in what was a much smoother and uneventful trade compared to last month's dramatic plunge into negative prices. The relatively smooth day to the expiry signals that the fundamentals with supply, demand, and storage availability have improved since last month. As of 1142 a.m. CDT on Tuesday, prices fell back a bit with WTI Crude trading at $31.69, down by 0.41 percent on the day, while Brent Crude prices were down 0.95 percent at $34.45. Tuesday's trading session is shaping up to be a non-event, even if today is the expiry date of the front-month June contract of WTI Crude futures and a few weeks ago analysts were warning of another dip into negative prices after the U.S. benchmark prices plummeted by 300% to settle at -$37.63 per barrel a day before the May futures contract expired last month. Oil prices have been rising for two weeks, and jumped by 11 percent to a two-month high of over $32 on Monday, amid signs of demand recovery and accelerated production cuts from all oil producers. Last week, the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory decline of 700,000 barrels for the week to May 8--the first drop in commercial inventories in 16 weeks. Related Should U.S. Shale Be Worried About A Chinese Takeover Oil demand in the world's top oil importer, China, is said to have rebounded to nearly pre-coronavirus levels. Gasoline demand in the United States stood at 7.398 million bpd for the week to May 8, and although this was still below the 9.148-million bpd demand for the same week last year, the number was a clear improvement from the 5.86-million-bpd demand just two weeks prior, EIA data shows.  Referring to the WTI Crude contract rollover today, Steen Jakobsen, Chief Investment Officer at Saxo Bank, said on Monday "The expiry tomorrow of the June WTI contract is expected to be a non-event after stockpiles at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, shrank last week." Yet, there is a short-term risk to the oil price rally, and this is producers rolling back the cuts, especially in the U.S. with the price back above $30 a barrel, Jakobsen said.

Bliźnięta Daniel i David urodziły się w Nigerii w lutym 2020 roku. Choć chłopcy przyszli na świat zaledwie kilka minut po sobie, znacząco się od siebie różnią. Daniel ma ciemną skórę, czarne, kręcone włosy – podobnie, jak jego starsza siostra Demilade. David natomiast jest albinosem, a jego skóra i włosy są jasne. – Kiedy dzieci się urodziły, byliśmy w szoku. Robiliśmy badania w trakcie ciąży, ale nic nie wskazywało na to, że chłopcy będą się aż tak od siebie różnić – przyznają rodzice niemowlaków Stacy i Babajide, którzy na co dzień mieszkają w Lagos. Para dodaje, że ich dzieci wzbudzają sporą sensację, gdy udają się wspólnie na spacer czy do sklepu. – Często zdarza się, że na ulicy zaczepiają nas ludzie i pytają, dlaczego Daniel i David nie wyglądają tak samo – opowiada matka chłopców dodając, że kocha swoje dzieci najmocniej na świecie, bez względu na to, jak wyglądają.

If you want to be a purist, here’s the classic version of the Caesar salad, created by Caesar Cardini at his restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico, nearly a century ago.
 It’s still as popular as ever because it’s so darn good. You can add anchovies if you wish, but the classic Caesar didn’t have them.
 The True Caesar Salad
 Makes 2 to 3 servings
 — Loaf of French bread
 ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
 2 garlic cloves, peeled
 1 head romaine lettuce
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 1 egg, coddled or boiled for 1 minute
 ½ cup grated Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese
 — Juice of 1 lemon
 — Dash Worcestershire sauce
 — Fresh-ground black pepper to taste
 If you want to be a squeaky-pure purist, make croutons from scratch. Cut the crusts from two ¾-inch thick rounds of French bread and toast the rounds on a baking sheet at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.
 Brush both sides with olive oil and rub them with a garlic clove cut in half, then return them to the oven for a few minutes until crisp and lightly browned. Then cut the rounds to your desired size (½-inch cubes are traditional).
 Select only the inner leaves of the romaine, about 7- or 8-inches long and light green. Save the dark green outer leaves for other uses. Rinse the leaves until they’re free of grit, then gently pat dry.
 In a small bowl, mince the remaining garlic and mash it into the salt. Then, with a fork, incorporate the half cup of olive oil.
 Just before serving, place the romaine leaves in a large bowl, drizzle with the garlic oil mixture and toss to coat. Break the egg into the salad and toss again until it’s well incorporated. Sprinkle on the lemon juice and toss. Add the Reggiano-Parmigiano, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and pepper and toss.
 Add the croutons, toss and divide into bowls to serve.
