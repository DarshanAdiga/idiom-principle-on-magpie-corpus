Nobody can align support like Paul, who navigated the restlessness in June by helping negotiate deals with the league to create the NBA Foundation, which will contribute $300 million over the next 10 years to various economic efforts in Black communities. He created his own Social Change Fund with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade to work those ends individually, too. He helped create in-bubble events like a Zoom chat with Michelle Obama for the NBA and WNBA, about her non-profit non-partisan voting group, When We All Vote.
