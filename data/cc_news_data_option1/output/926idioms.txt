My antique Apple mini computer (at the end of a 5m AudioQuest Cinnamon USB cable) failed to recognize the Artera Solus, but my newer MacBook Air laptop sat squarely and attractively on the Solus's glass top and synched instantly via a 1.5m AudioQuest Diamond cable. For about a week, I played Tidal and Qobuz night and day. On Miles Davis's _A Tribute to Jack Johnson_ (44.1/16 FLAC Columbia/Tidal), bass was tight, fast, and tuneful, but high frequencies were sort of hard and mechanicalthis with the default Smooth filter (see below). Nevertheless, streamed music came out of the Klipsch RP-600M speakers with a greater sense of force and density than it did via my reference HoloAudio Spring DAC feeding the Solus's line-level input.

HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii officials on Friday said they have confirmed the state's first case of the new coronavirus in a man who had been on a cruise ship from California to Mexico that had other infected passengers. The man fell ill after flying home to Oahu from Mexico after the Grand Princess cruise that was scheduled Feb. 11-21, Assistant State Epidemiologist Sarah Kemble said. He did not have symptoms of the disease while he was traveling home, which means he wasn't at risk for transmitting the disease to others at the time, Kemble said. He contacted a doctor and was assessed when he fell ill. He was well enough to go home and has been in isolation there, Kemble said. The man hasn't had any close contact with anyone in Hawaii since falling ill, she said. He tested positive for the disease on Friday. Gov. David Ige said officials do not believe that the virus is spreading in the community in Hawaii at this time. The same cruise ship took another voyage from California to Hawaii after the trip to Mexico, bringing some of the same passengers and crew members with it. The state Department of Health said the vessel made port calls to Nawiliwili on Kauai on Feb. 26, Honolulu on Feb. 27, Lahaina on Maui on Feb. 28, and Hilo on Hawaii Island on Feb. 29. On Friday, the cruise ship was off the coast of San Francisco after returning from Hawaii while California officials tested those on board for the virus. So far 21 people, including 19 crew members, have tested positive. State officials were investigating who had close contact with those who tested positive. The department said it's working to identify who disembarked at each port and identify who had close contact with those individuals. The department said “close contact” is defined as close personal face-to-face...

Washington, Mar 7 (PTI) US President Donald Trump has said the overall risk to the American public from deadly Coronavirus remains low.


  "I think at this point, … the overall risk to the American public does remain low," Trump told reporters on Friday after he visited Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta.


  According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker at least 299 cases of coronavirus have been detected in the US and 14 people have died due to it.


  The total number of cases globally stands at 101,88 with 3,460 deaths, as per the data compiled by the university. India has reported 31 cases of coronavirus, the university said.


  Referring to the cases and deaths reported in other countries like China, Trump asserted that coronavirus is under control in the US.


  "Now, you look at throughout the world, I mean, other countries have--South Korea, Italy, and in particular China, have many. Now, I also hear the numbers are getting much better in those places, and I've heard the numbers are getting much better in China. But I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy," he said.


  At a White House news conference later in the day, Vice President Mike Pence said that 21 people aboard a cruise ship held off the coast of California have tested positive for the coronavirus.


  There were 3,500 people on board the Grand Princess ship anchored near San Francisco.


  "All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus. Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require an additional medical attention will receive it," Pence said.


  "Let me assure the American public as we did so with Americans returning from China and those returning from the other cruise ship we are taking all measures necessary to see to the health of the Americans and those involved on the grand Princess and just as importantly to protect the health of the American public and prevent the spread of the disease through communities in this country," he said.


  Pence is leading the efforts of the Trump Administration in containing coronavirus. He has been holding daily meetings and has been addressing joint news conferences with other top officials at the White House.


  "President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people. He's assembled an extraordinary group of Americans and agencies," the vice president said.

  This year, however, the rapid spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China, is threatening to disrupt their ability to travel here, potentially scratching those hiring plans. Already, Chinese students are unable to enter the country. Visa services have been suspended at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and U.S. consulates in other Chinese cities.


  The students participate in the J-1 international student program, a four- month program that includes three months of work in the United States and a month of cultural enrichment.

COLDWATER -- The Coldwater Cardinals ended their 2019-20 regular season schedule with an emphatic statement Thursday night, rolling to a big 71-49 victory over a very solid Portage Central program at the Coach Floyd Eby Gymnasium.


  "We thought it would be a great game and a great contest going into the state tournament, playing a team of this caliber," said Coldwater head coach Aaron Bucklin. "We were hoping that a game like this would help get us ready for the postseason and it really did, it was a good game, we saw some things we needed to see and we saw some things that we need to clean up before Monday night."


  Coming into the game the Cardinals knew they would face a barrage of outside shooting, as Portage Central runs a very guard heavy lineup, one that can shoot the three no matter the position. In contrast, the Cardinals knew that they had the advantage in the paint with the duo of Dylan Targgart and Austin Santure and the Cardinals exploited that advantage from the opening tip.


  Both teams came sprinting out of the gate as the scoring came fast and furious from both teams. Portage Central took the slimmest of leads at 5-4 with just under five minutes to go after a deep three pointer leading to a Coldwater timeout.


  The Cardinals buckled down out of the break and started to take advantage of their size down low. Two straight buckets from senior Dylan Targgart propelled the Cardinals into the lead in a hurry, giving Coldwater a 9-5 lead at just under four minutes to play in the first quarter.


  Portage Central came back with a 5-1 run to knot the score up at 10-10 only to see the Cardinals retake the lead on a tough layup from Brandon Downs on the next trip down the floor. Another three pointer from Portage Central looked to push the Mustangs into the lead at the quarter break however the Cardinals responded just before the buzzer as senior Austin Santure grabbed a loose ball down low and hit a tough bucket just before the buzzer to give Coldwater the 14-13 lead after one quarter.


  Coldwater continued to exploit their size advantage down low, as the duo of Santure and Targgart continued to go to work.


  The Cardinals managed to build a 18-13 lead with an early 4-0 run however the Mustangs weren't about to let Coldwater get away just yet, using their three point prowess to close to within 20-19 with just under four minutes to go in the half.


  The Cardinals went back down low and managed to build a small 25-19 lead until the three pointers began to fall again for Portage Central with the Mustangs quickly tying the score at 25-25 with just under two minutes to go. The Cardinals ended the quarter with a 4-0 run, giving Coldwater a 29-25 lead at the half.


  Both teams were off and running again to start the second half and it was Coldwater getting the better of the early exchange, quickly building a double digit lead at 39-29 with 5:20 left to play in the third. Portage again answered with a three pointer, closing the score to 39-32.


  A series of big momentum changes made things interesting over the next several minutes of play, with several three pointers from the Mustangs closing the score to 41-37 with three minutes to go in the quarter.


  Coldwater wrestled away the momentum once again, going on a 6-0 run to rebuild their double digit lead to 47-37. The Cardinals would go on to take a 49-40 lead after three quarters.


  Portage Central made things interesting early in the fourth quarter, closing to within single digits once again at 56-47 after a pair of free throws. That's as close as the Mustangs would get, as Coldwater dominated the final five minutes of play. The Cardinals went on to outscore Portage Central 15-2 over the final four minutes, showing their dominance on the inside. The Cardinals big run was punctuated by a huge fast break, as senior Austin Santure took an long outlet pass and threw down a massive two handed dunk to continually extend the Cardinal lead.


  Coldwater went on to roll past a very solid Portage Central team, taking the big 71-49 victory.


  "We knew that they were going to shoot the three tonight, they like to play five guards and we knew they could shoot," said Bucklin. "They created a bit of a match up problem early on with their guards and some of our bigs but we knew that they could not contend with Dylan (Targgart) and CT (Austin Santure) down low."


  The Cardinals had four players reach double figures, led by a pair of double- doubles by the Coldwater big men. Four year starter Dylan Targgart led the Cardinal scoring effort with 19 points and 10 rebounds while teammate Austin Santure added 17 points and 11 rebounds to go along with two steals.


  Sophomore Ethan Crabtree had a solid night of action, finishing with 14 points, five rebounds and two assists while sophomore Brandon Downs added 11 points and five assists.


  Also adding to the Coldwater effort was Spencer Rodesiler with four points, five rebounds, eight assists and two steals while Jaxon Janusz added four points, three rebounds and two assists.


  Portage Central was led on the night by Hunter Young who had 19 points.


  With the victory Coldwater finishes their 2019-20 regular season with a record of 14-6 while Portage Central falls to 16-4 overall on the year.


  The Cardinals will next see action Monday when they head to Lakeview High School to face off with Kalamazoo Loy Norrix in the first round of the Division One District tournament, with game time scheduled for 5 p.m. Portage Central will face off with Kalamazoo Central in their first round matchup Monday at St. Joseph High School.

In the war my great grandpa was in the Navy, he was a Shore Lander. He drove the boats onto shore to drop off soldiers to fight in the battles. His job was very scary, but there was no time to be nervous because you have to be on and off the shore so fast to stay alive. While serving in the pacific he participated in 2 of the biggest battles of the war; Iwo Jima and Okinawa, as he said in his book “It was at these times when I spoke to God, promising him that I got through this I would go to church every Sunday!”. Finally on August 14th, 1945 the Japanese surrendered and this nightmare in the Pacific was over, all he was required to do was clean up as his ship had been instructed too. By picking up 50 members on the US weather team in Siberia. At the end of the war his ship had traveled over 59,000 miles and was decommissioned on May 31st, 1946.

  Harris said he wants people to know that anti-Semitism is not just a threat to the Jewish community, but to all Americans.


  "Don't ignore it. Don't look the other way," he said, "Confront it and understand that it threatens everything that America stands for: democracy, pluralism, mutual respect and the rule of law.


  "This was an attack on Bernie, but ultimately it is an attack on all of us as Americans and we need to stand against it."
