In the Diocese of Southwark, on the south bank of the Thames (but still very much within London), Bishop Christopher Chessun and his suffragans initially allowed the resident priest concession granted in London Diocese. But now they interpret the archbishops‚Äô directive to the letter. ‚ÄúWe know that this will seem especially hard for those of you who live next door to, or on the same site as, your church; but the Archbishops believe that it is right that we all share the challenges of these extraordinary times as equally as possible and conduct even private worship strictly in the confines of our own homes.‚Äù

Sandberg packed plenty of surprises during his first DC blockbuster, including a Superman cameo and the introduction of the entire Shazam family in their superhero forms. If _Black Adam_ ends up starting production on time, then perhaps we'll finally get to see Shazam fight his arch nemesis from the comics. Only time will tell.

And that might be pretty painful and you‚Äôre going to have to restart and regenerate all your work on that side."
