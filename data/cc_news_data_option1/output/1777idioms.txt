As the state reopens, victim advocacy groups anticipate a surge of abuse- related calls.
 This would be a reversal of what many organizations in the Treasure Valley saw during the duration of Gov. Brad Little's stay-home order, first issued on March 25. Call numbers dropped during the order, catching many advocates off guard.
 “People just don’t stop abusing,” said Jeannie Strohmeyer, program manager at the Nampa Family Justice Center. “We’re not seeing the people we should, and that’s concerning.”
 Strohmeyer said economic hardships and health concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can make an already stressful home environment even more volatile. This might cause an abuser to lash out more regularly at a victim — which could be a child, elder parent and/or intimate partner — or escalate their behavior, going from emotional abuse to physical violence.
 Since many workplaces temporarily closed and schools switched to remote learning, Strohmeyer said the people who typically report any suspected domestic violence or child abuse — such as a coworker or teacher — no longer have eyes on these individuals, allowing an abuser's actions to go unnoticed and unchecked. People in the community might not be aware of the center's existence or know what services are provided there, she added.
 Strohmeyer said the center is already seeing a slight uptick in calls, but the call volume is still notably less than what the staff was experiencing at this point last year. The organization serves more than 6,000 victims each year.
 "It is profound what is happening in the home because of all of these stresses — one on top of another, on top of another," Strohmeyer said. "It's like a pressure cooker, and we fully expect our numbers to explode."
 Paige Dinger, executive director of Faces of Hope, said the Boise-based nonprofit also saw a decline in abuse-related calls after March 25, as well as an overall decrease in-person visits. But the number of people seeking civil protection orders, on the other hand, did see a notable increase during the stay-home order.
 Dinger said Faces of Hope can help someone file a protection order, a service commonly provided at a county courthouse. Once the order is filed, victims are able to attend any hearings via their smartphone or computer.
 Since many people worry their phone or computer is being monitored by their abuser, Dinger said Faces also is providing free smartphones to victims of domestic violence, so they'll be able to have internet access and connect with family members, friends and even the nonprofit's trauma-informed counselors.
 "We're prepared to help people in any way that we can," Dinger said. "And if there's a surge, which we anticipate there will be, we're ready."
 Like Strohmeyer and Dinger, Kelly Miller, executive director of the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic violence, said her organization has seen a decrease in calls since the governor’s order went into effect.
 Miller compared the situation to those in other states, such as Washington, which saw outbreaks of COVID-19 before Idaho did. Across the country, advocates are seeing fewer people reach out for help, not because domestic violence has stopped, but because victims don’t have a safe, private way to ask for help.
 Because domestic violence is still ongoing, Miller said she expects to see a spike in calls once social distancing measures are eased. What’s more, stress from the financial hardship and job loss brought on by the virus probably aren’t helping abusive situations either.
 “None of those cause domestic violence on their own, but it certainly can increase the stress level on the household,” Miller said.
 And when people are reaching out, Miller said their situation is often more dire, and the injuries they have sustained may be more serious.
 “So it could be (that) people are waiting until the very last minute,” Miller added.

The companion animal business has been the key growth driver as the expanding middle-class population chooses to spend increasingly on pet care. According to the American Pet Products Association, the total spending on pets in the U.S. was close to $95.7 billion in 2019. Of these, pet food and treats accounted for $36.9 billion while vet care made up almost $29.3 billion of the spending. Spending on Supplies, live animals, and OTC (over-the-counter) medicine was $19.2 billion. Spending on other services which include boarding, grooming, insurance, training, pet sitting and walking and all services outside of veterinary care was $10.3 billion.
 Understandably, companion animal health products accounted for almost 47% of Zoetis' total revenues in 2019. Companion animal health products are also higher-margin products in the company's product portfolio. This segment reported 23% YoY rise in revenues in 2019, driven by rising demand for new products in parasiticides and dermatology segments and for medical and veterinary diagnostics tests. In the first quarter, companion animal health segment reported revenues of $797 million, a YoY jump of 9.3%.
 Another positive aspect of Zoetis is the increasing number of pet adoptions from shelter houses. The expanding base of pet owners is definitely a strong growth driver for Zoetis in the long run.
 Although the COVID-19 outbreak is definitely a major disruption, the basic dynamics for this segment will remain mostly unchanged. Zoetis enjoys significant pricing power due to a limited number of competitors. Hence, realistically, Zoetis can grow its companion animal health revenues by a high- single-digit percentage rate in post-COVID-19 times.
 However, in 2019, the company's livestock business faced problems such as the outbreak of African swine fever in China and challenging beef and dairy cattle market conditions in the U.S. Despite this, rising demand for animal protein from a growing global population continues to support Zoetis' livestock business. In the first quarter, Zoetis reported revenues of $717 million for livestock business, a YoY jump of 1.4%.

So just to add to that, Josh, on the accounting side. The ounces were obviously produced back in 2017. so when you look at it as it comes through in the second quarter, there will obviously be a disconnect between sales and production because there will be higher sales than production. The cost of that inventory again is sitting on our balance sheet, so as we sell that gold we’ll bring to that cost. And the proceeds of that sales will obviously go to the individual operations. And then those proceeds will be shared amongst the shareholders in the 84%, 16% split. That said, of course we have our 50-50 sharing arrangement.

But that was the only opportunity Williams got in front of live scouts. Weber State’s pro day, along with several others around the country, were canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak.
 So Williams moved into a family friend’s trailer for eight weeks in Provo — 80 miles away from his wife Kennedy — to train for a makeshift pro day in March. He and his agent had to personally set up drills and film it to send off to teams.
 He ended up pulling off double duties really well.
 The 4.14-second and 6.71-second marks he posted in the shuttle and the three- cone drills, respectively, were better than all of the times put up by defensive linemen at the NFL Scouting Combine in February. His 40-yard dash (4.67 seconds), vertical leap (35 inches) and bench press (30 reps) would have all ranked in the top-5 as well.
 Experts still pegged him as a borderline draft pick, though.
 Williams returned to his parents’ house in Meridian to watch all three days of the NFL Draft hoping to get the call. He ultimately did — just after all 255 picks had been submitted. But Williams reached a deal with the Rams later that same night and became just the sixth former Idaho high school player to currently be on an NFL roster.
 “I felt a big weight come off my shoulders. There was no more guessing or wondering where or if I was going to end up anywhere,” Williams said. “I just felt super blessed to get the nod with all the things that had happened because I honestly didn’t even know if any of what I had done would lead to anything. So I was thinking about how lucky I was to get an opportunity.”
 Williams finds himself in a state of limbo right now.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has canceled all NFL practices and off-field work indefinitely. There’s also no rookie minicamps on the schedule right now. He hasn’t even received his copy of the playbook yet.
 But it hasn’t stopped him from lifting weights in his buddy’s garage and running on a mountain trail near his house in Ogden. It’s all to be in the best of shape for a position he didn’t even think required it all those years ago.
 “I just look back on it and laugh,” Williams said. “It didn’t take me a lot of time to understand that clearly wasn’t the case and how fun the position actually is.
 “It ended up changing my life.”

It's a lousy title - one that isn't explained till just before the end credits run - but it's not a bad movie. Neither, unfortunately, is much of a good movie. Even so, the target audience of female tweens and teens, as well as some slightly older young women, just might eat this up.      The opening shot, a full-screen close-up on the face of Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein, from "Lady Bird" and "Booksmart") makes it clear that this is going to be a story about her ... about her insecurities, her dreams, her missteps, and eventually her redemption.      It's 1993. She's 16, lives with her family in the British town of Wolverhampton, and is an overachiever at school, always writing long-winded essays, much to the consternation of her English teacher. But writing is her passion; the girl can't help it.      She also has a regular practice of escaping from reality, and spends a great deal of time in her bedroom, having conversations, in a Harry Potter-like manner, with photos and paintings on her wall. And those folks on the wall - Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, and Maria von Trapp among them - are ready to offer some advice, at least in Johanna's head.      Though the family is close, there are money problems. Breeding border collies doesn't quite pay the bills. On top of that, mom (Sarah Solemani) has a touch of depression, and loose, laidback dad (Paddy Considine, terrific in the role), is a bit of a scoundrel, as well as being a frustrated ex-drummer who still wants to play in a pop band.      Johanna's hopes are boosted when she hears of an opening to be a rock critic at the (fictional) London fanzine Disc and Music Echo, and even though her taste in music leans toward "Tomorrow" from "Annie," she catches a break, due in part to an assignment that no one at the magazine wants, and gets a gig covering a concert.      But first, she decides to reinvent herself, physically changing her appearance and wardrobe from the relatively bland Johanna Morrigan to the glitzy, lipsticked, top-hatted Dolly Wilde. From that point on, every scene, and almost every moment of the movie, rests on the shoulders of Feldstein, who goes at it with a big dose of frenetic energy and a winning smile. Her dream is coming true, she lands more review assignments, and she tries for a step up the freelance ladder by asking to write a feature - and getting a yes.      This leads to a third strong performance in the film - after those of Feldstein and Considine - and the introduction of pop star and singer of sad songs John Kite (Alfie Allen, Theon from "Game of Thrones"), who is to be her first interview subject (and it turns out that Allen is a very good singer!).      Complications arise, the term "off the record" might not be quite clear to the novice interviewer, emotions veer out of control, things go badly, and a John Kite poster starts talking to her, attempting to help her out of the problems she inadvertently creates for herself. One of them involves the changes she finds herself going through. Her magazine wants tough stories, not fawning pieces, and Johanna plunges down a dark hole that results in new, not very pleasant personalities taking root in her. Her profiles and reviews turn nasty, her attitude toward her family becomes one of a jerk, she becomes recognized for her "toxic writing," and she's proud of it.      She morphs into a protagonist that no one will be rooting for, not even that young target audience. Most of this works quite well in a dramatic sense. But some lazy writing late in the film leads to a lame plot twist that turns everything around too conveniently, with wrongs being righted too easily.      For a brief moment, the film again finds its footing, with Alfie Allen's acting range saving the day, but then we get an unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the very end with a message delivered to anyone still interested - those young girls again - to be yourself. That lesson was already there, in the words of the characters. It sure didn't need to be given twice.      "How to Build a Girl" premieres on VOD platforms on May 8.

On some of those occasions, viruses carrying the mutation didn’t take off in the population. Instead, the gene reverted to its original form, suggesting that D614G didn’t give the virus any special advantage.
 Some researchers took to Twitter to critique the paper. “I think those claims are suspect, to say the least,” wrote Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
 “They got a bit over their skis on title, conclusions,” wrote Brian Wasik, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University. “They deserve a strong and good- faith peer review.”
 None of the critics ruled out the possibility that a mutation could arise that would make the virus more transmissible. And it’s possible that D614G has provided some sort of edge.
 But it will take much more evidence to rule out other explanations.

Former Wythe County Board of Supervisors Chairman Charles S. Dix died over the weekend. Though Dix was known by those closest to him as a farmer and family man, he held the distinction of serving on the Wythe County Board of Supervisors for 16 years.
 “Charles Dix was a caring person with a heart of gold that always put others before himself and loved his family, Crockett, Rural Retreat and Wythe County,” retired Wythe County Administrator Cellell Dalton said in an email. “Charles Dix placed Wythe County as his number one priority as can be witnessed with all the school construction, industrial development, and water and sewer improvements completed during his years on the Board of Supervisors. I have admired Mr. Dix’s caring toward his family, community, giving and others first virtues. I believe that every Wythe Countian for many years to come will see the impact of Charles Dix’s time and leadership on the Board of Supervisors. I was saddened with the news of his passing but I will always have fond memories of my time working with Mr. Dix.”
 According to a county press release, the people of the Blacklick District of Wythe County first elected Dix to serve as their representative in November 1993. Dix continued to serve in this position until Dec. 31, 2009, serving as board chairman in 1996 and 2000, as well as vice-chairman from 2001-2003.

And bear in mind that many were expecting the demise of the Chinese soybean imports last year during the height of the outbreak. And China actually imported slightly more soybeans last year than they did in ‘18. So likely, they sought to maximize output across all their livestock classes.

And I think that's the standout in the Barrick 10 year plan, built on of course tier one assets, which mean that you've got significant production for more than 10 years in your business plan based on $1,200 long-term gold price. And so when you look at this business, it's a genuine business where the growth is then in financial delivery, in profits depending on the gold price that you received. Now over and above that, we spending $170 odd million a year in exploration. And as you've seen just in the last 15 months, we not shy on creating M&A opportunities that deliver real value. And so that's the difference is this is not a sustaining business or a business that you refer to as a consistent production.

Thank you, Jonas. Yes, we did make a conscious effort to conserve cash in Q1, and we normally do that as that is our lowest cash flow quarter. So we try not to spend as much capital in that quarter if we can help it. And with COVID, we were even more focused in the first quarter. But we do expect some acceleration of spending as we go through the year, particularly in the summer months in Canada. As you know, K3 is our biggest expenditure, single expenditure area. And on that, a lot of that work is going to go this summer. But we believe that, that work is necessary, and as we’ve said previously, we’ll drive lower cost and more efficiency in the long run.

In terms of our overall costs, these have been pretty much constant in Phosphates for up to 10 years. And we’re able to, each year, improve in such a way that we’re taking the impact of inflation out of our cost, which I think is actually making us much more competitive in the long term.

Thank you, guys. Certainly, the oil industry disruption is having a knock-on effect in terms of sulfur. At Mosaic, there’s 2 things we’re doing to really help our sulfur situation. One, as you suggested, we are moving to a higher level of inventory to make sure we have a better buffer. And then secondly, we’ve actually been sourcing cheap or cheap-ish sulfuric acid to supplement our supply. Now that has worked out quite well because other industries have slowed down. But in terms of the overall world sulfur market, one of the things I will say is Mosaic is probably better positioned than most because of our position in U.S. Gulf. And remember, in the U.S. Gulf, while the production is down, they’re using more heavy crude right now, which produces more sulfur. Certainly, there is going to be periodic and localized sulfur deficiencies around the globe. But I think in that, Mosaic will be positioned best to weather the storm.

--DocBreak--
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sports Illustrated is branching out into movies and television.
 Authentic Brands Group and 101 Studios announced on Tuesday that they will launch Sports Illustrated Studios as part of a joint venture between the two companies.
 The studio’s first project will be a docu-series entitled “Covers.” It will explore the stories behind the magazine’s most memorable covers and what went into creating them. The project’s release date as well as five additional projects are expected to be announced over the next four weeks.
 Authentic Brands Group — which also holds the licensing and trademark rights to celebrities such as Muhammad Ali, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley — acquired the licensing and marketing rights to Sports Illustrated last May from the Meredith Corporation. 101 Studios is best known for producing “Yellowstone” on the Paramount Network, which stars Kevin Costner, as well as recent films like “The Current War: Director’s Cut” and “Burden.”
 The launch comes amid a global shutdown of most sports due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hungry for alternatives, broadcasters have been serving up reruns of classic games and other content, like ESPN’s hit Michael Jordan documentary, “The Last Dance.” ESPN created its own films unit in 2008 and has produced over 100 documentaries with many part of the “30 For 30” brand.
 Authentic Brands Group Chairman and CEO Jamie Salter said creating a film and television studio represents another key development toward building Sports Illustrated’s brand for the future. Salter also said discussions with 101 Studios CEO David Glasser about joining forces were in the works before ABG completed its acquisition last year.
 Glasser said representatives from 101 Studios have been meeting with SI writers to get ideas for documentaries and shows they would like to see produced. He added that the magazine’s more than 60-year history of sports coverage lends itself to creating different types of content being produced.
 “It can be films, scripted series shows,” he said. “We didn’t realize how much sports-related content we had already been working on until we dug deeper. The articles and covers can bring past stories to life but also we can look to the future and stories writers are working on that we might be able to reverse engineer into a six-hour mini series.
 “There are so many ideas that can work hand in hand,” he said.
 Since buying Sports Illustrated, ABG has licensed the publishing rights to Maven Media. The magazine has gone from being a weekly publication three years ago to monthly. The last eight months have seen multiple rounds of layoffs and Maven has tried building the brand digitally with team sites run by contract employees.
 While Salter acknowledged the past year has been a roller coaster at times, he points to digital growth from 10 million to 34 million page views monthly as well as increases in profitability.
 “Longform content is a big part of our vision,” Salter said. “We have made great strides in tapping the value of this franchise and expanding its reach. Since taking it over we have looked at a number of different deals. With this added piece and a few others we have been happy.”

By now restrictions are being relaxed step by step. This is in contrast to the situation in the US where people have taken the law into their hands and demanding the states re-open. For example, in NSW, from last Friday two visitors can be welcome. This means parents and children or grandparents who could not see face to face can now visit each other. Schools are to be re- opened too. Initially one day a week face to face and the rest by online teaching. Gatherings of 10 people will be allowed. If these measures do not produce more infections, government will relax further restrictions. Next Friday, the national cabinet will decide which other measures to be taken to relax restrictions. In any case, it appears that we have to live with some number of cases –up and down- for some time to come. Even after reducing new infections, social distancing will continue until a vaccine or a drug that can treat the virus is found.

The other thing we’re doing is, as I mentioned in my comments, is we’re taking opportunity from this slower production period to really drive a lot of improvements in the factory. We’re using a lot more digitization and automation, robotics. We’re changing workflows, moving workaround between different facilities to make things more efficient. And so, when we go back up in rates, we can do so a lot more efficiently than we could in the past. And on the MAX side of things, one other big changes that we have already converted everything to the MAX. The last time we went up in rate, we were doing that at the same time we were converting from the NG to the MAX. This time we’ve already made that conversion.

So Matt, again, there's swings and roundabouts. So the way we've looked at it is that this COVID challenge has certainly created some additional expenses in our business. At the same time, we've benefited from a lower oil price. Some of the the impacts are dampened, particularly in Africa where the oil price is much more structured and it doesn't pass through to the consumer as quickly as you see in parts of North America. But as a broad number, $10 on oil is about $8 per ounce, just as a broad number. Remember our utilization of hydrocarbons is quite different, some natural gas, some diesel, some heavy fuel. But as a rule of thumb, that's about the number.

Hey, Rob, the only thing I would add is if there was some semi-permanent pain as it relates to long-term production rates for extended periods of time, obviously we’d be looking at all of our facilities and evaluating facility consolidation, etcetera, to really resize and restructure the entirety of the business. So, we have a few more what I would say opportunities for us to not only pull hard on our variable costs structure. People aligning our production rates on the supply chain side, but if there was a long-term permanent impairment in the commercial aerospace industry, we have some other cost actions that we can evaluate to better align our overall cost structure with the long-term production rates.

We've worked hard at it with the regional executive teams. And this corona challenge has definitely honed our management skills and forced and fast tracked our ability to be agile and integrated in the way we run things.
