I miss the old days of well-planned scheduling. But, as I say, in certain moods you can miss anything. Watching Imelda Staunton’s phenomenal turn as a poison-pen wielder in the first episode (“A Lady of Letters”), I suddenly yearned for the loony missives I used to get myself, when I first appeared on TV, before “social media” came along. They seemed creepy and unpleasant at the time but, compared with what people say on the internet, they were like polite invitations to a tea dance.

On any summer day, in the middle of the state's largest cherry orchard belt, folks in Traverse City, Michigan, are busy enjoying its natural splendor -- swimming, sailing, hiking or relaxing in Adirondack chairs by the beach. And its cultural and culinary vitality make it worth more than just a pit stop.      About 250 miles northwest of Detroit and scattered among rolling farmland and hardwood forests, Traverse City has dozens of lakes and waterways, historic lighthouses, and ships and boats that travel its bay and inlets. Best of all, it has Lake Michigan in its backyard -- including the bucolic Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, where sand dunes tower up to 400 feet above turquoise-colored water.      "If you want to get away, get out in nature and spread out, this is the perfect place to do it," said Jillian Manning, public relations manager for Traverse City Tourism.      Traverse City also has become known for the quality of its wines (it has more than 40 wineries in the area) and craft breweries and is getting national attention for its imaginative local cuisine.      The town has much to offer in the way of museums, theaters, shops and galleries and is home to The Dennos Museum Center, which has the largest collection of Inuit art in the country.      Its climate has made it an ideal place to grow all types of cherries, but it's one of the leading producers of tart cherries in the United States, Manning said.      And cherries aren't the only crop this fruit-forward place is famous for growing. Because of its location along the 45th parallel, which is halfway between the North Pole and Equator, the region is ideal for growing grapes. It's at the same longitude of the great grape-growing regions of Spain and France, Manning said.      Traverse's agricultural bounty has made it into a rich culinary destination, with restaurants ranging from French to Vietnamese to farm-to-table to taco stands. This summer, Manning said, outdoor dining will be expanded to a two- block downtown area on Front Street (between Park and Union streets). The area will be closed to traffic and additional outdoor seating has been added so diners can properly practice social distancing.      Two downtown architectural and historical gems are the State Theatre and the City Opera House. The State, built in the early 1900s, was the first in Traverse City to offer a "talkie film" and features the annual Traverse City Film Festival, hosted by filmmaker Michael Moore. This year it was canceled because of COVID-19.      The 1891 Victorian, brick opera house -- one of 50 opera houses built in Michigan in the 19th century -- is one of a handful that are still standing. It was closed in 1920 but fully restored in 2005 and hosts concerts, dance performances and appearances by noted writers.      The Grand Traverse Commons -- a complex of galleries, shops, restaurants and residential areas housed in pale yellow, Victorian-Italianate buildings built in 1885 -- is surrounded by meadows and forests and was once a state mental hospital.

The United States military, in a series of conflicts lasting over 100 years, slowly killed off a large portion of the Native American population after stealing their land. They forced the rest onto reservations even though many of the people lived in a nomadic culture. These wounds continue to reverberate.
 American racism has not been limited to blacks and Native Americans. Our treatment, both through legislation of law and acts to protect American security, has been less than stellar in how we treat Asian Americans and Latin Americans as well. And too often churches and Christians were either silent or complicit in all these forms of racism.
 And so it needs to be said, that when a man named George Floyd, an outspoken Christian believer by the way, gets killed by a police officer on the street, that we need to say that this is wrong. This needs to be recognized as part of a systemic issue of violence against vulnerable people of color that includes lynchings, cross burnings and more. The same is true with a group of white men in a pick-up truck hunting down and shooting a black young man in Georgia in broad daylight. This is wrong as well. And when African American folks, as well as other minority groups, say that this kind of treatment is typical instead of an anomaly, we need to lean in and listen. And care.
 It is also wrong is the way we often treat and speak of people who speak Spanish as their first language, the way many of us make broad sweeping generalizations about Native Americans. Again, the examples are lengthy.
 All of this, this biblical teaching that racial prejudice and violence is wrong, needs to be said. It needs to be stated and restated by believers and clergy alike. We also need to act on our commitment to justice and love for our friends and family by speaking out when people are mistreated, and making real, concrete efforts to make matters right.
 At the same time, I feel frustrated, because I think understanding the truth of God’s love for all, and for standing for justice, fair treatment and being sensitive to those who for whatever reason are being mistreated should go without saying. You know, I think loving our neighbors, and doing justice for the poor, the minority, and the marginalized is like Following Jesus 101. It is like “Common Human Decency 101.” But, over and over again, common decency seems less common than one might think, and God’s truth needs to be restated in our present context.
 It is as simple as this. Choose not to be a jerk. And when you are a jerk, repent and ask for forgiveness, and try and make things right. Love your neighbor. Love your enemy. Turn the other cheek. Don’t hate those that are different than you. Stand up for those that don’t have the power or the ability to stand up for themselves. Help those in need. Be a person of justice. Be a person of mercy. Be a person that has a passion to break down walls of ignorance, prejudice, and hate. Be like Jesus. Amen?

Abhay also talked about an important facet of nepotism and mentioned that in a larger perspective, nepotism becomes an even severe problem because it is supported by caste-discrimination ideology in India. The actor, popular for his performances in films like _Dev.D_ (2009), _Oye Lucky Lucky Oye_ (2008), _Manorama Six Feet Under_ (2007) _,_ and _Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara_ (2011) among others, said that a son taking over a family's business in India is based on 'caste'. "While it plays a part in every country, nepotism has taken on another dimension here in India. I suspect caste plays a major role in it being more pronounced here than in other parts of the world. After all, it is “jati” that dictates that a son carry on the work of his father, while the daughter is expected to marry and be a housewife," he explained in the post.
 Asserting that we need a 'cultural evolution' to fight nepotism, Abhay went on to say that he has been speaking about important issues for many years now and has been receiving criticism for the same. However, the actor said that he's glad to see more people within the industry calling out the hypocrisy and the existence of prejudices.

LOS ANGELES -- When Denise Richards returned to the set of CBS' "The Bold and the Beautiful" last week after the pandemic shutdown filming for three months, a detailed, specific plan was in place to help keep everyone safe.
   
 The soap opera is under a microscope, as one of the first U.S. productions to resume after a COVID-19 outbreak that stopped production throughout the TV and movie industry out of safety concerns. Other studios and soap operas are working on restart plans. In the UK, the soap "Emmerdale" resumed filming last month.
   
 Richards said she wasn't anxious or worried about returning to work. Instead, she felt "very excited," she said in an interview.
   
 "It's important to move forward and move on. And we have to get back to work," she said.
   
 Before she could be cleared to work, Richards was tested for COVID-19. She will be tested weekly to get the green light to work the following week.
   
 Richards had her temperature taken upon arrival at the studio known as Television City in Los Angeles. A mask was required to enter the set and must be worn as much as possible during hair and makeup. Richards also had new labeled hair and makeup brushes waiting for her. A separate set was put in a plastic bin for touch-ups. Anything else an actor might need to bring to the set, including scripts, water or cellphone, also goes in that bin that they carry with them.
   
 There's a route to walk to the stage and a different one to exit. Before Richards could step on the stage before a camera, she had to answer questions about her health and have her temperature taken again.
   
 Crew members all wore masks, and anyone that has to be in close proximity to the actors also wears a face shield. Mannequins even were also brought in to help keep people apart.
   
 "It was challenging because the times our characters would get a little closer with each other, a mannequin would be there and I, the actor, stepped off to read the lines for the other actor talking to the mannequin."
   
 As for love scenes, there's a plan for that, too.
   
 A publicist for the show said mannequins would be used when touching or intimacy needs to happen if there isn't a "live″ stand-in. If mannequins are seen on camera, it would be only briefly.
   
 As for the "live'' stand-ins?
   
 "We were asked if our significant others would step in," said Richards whose husband Aaron Phypers will double for actor Thorsten Kaye, who plays her love interest, Ridge Forrester. Phypers is not an actor.
   
 Richards says she asked Phypers to take part by saying, 'They said I could also have my love scenes with a mannequin -- which is fine -- but I'd much rather be with my husband.'"
   
 Richards said face masks smudge makeup so touch-ups were needed more frequently.
   
 "It's a lot of work and it's tedious, but they're doing it," she said.
   
 Richards said she is happy to be taping for the loyal fans who have been anxiously waiting for new episodes. The soap, which premiered in 1987, is centered around the Forester family and its fashion design company. The soap has been airing fan favorite episodes since running out of new ones.

The 140,270 loans approved throughout Ohio from a federal coronavirus aid package touched about every corner of the state's economy.
   
 Manufacturers and museums, auto dealerships and attorneys, breweries and burger joints are among thousands of firms that benefited from the Payroll Protection Program, which offered loans up to $10 million to get companies through the pandemic.
   
 In Ohio, 84% of the loans were for $150,000 or less.
   
 Ten Ohio cities were approved for more than 1,000 loans of no more than $150,000. In Dublin, 1,311 loans were approved, and in Westerville, the total was 1,245 loans.
   
 Far smaller cities also racked up the loans, including Plain City, where about 70 loans were approved.
   
 The $660 billion program is meant to help mostly small organizations with up to a few hundred employees ride out the coronavirus pandemic. About $130 billion in funding remains.
   
 The loans are forgiven if all workers remain employed for eight weeks and the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest or utilities. As of June 30, Ohio businesses have received $18.4 billion.
   
 Here's a look at how some recipients spent the money:
   
 White Castle
   
 The 99-year-old restaurant chain received a loan of between $5 million and $10 million.
   
 "This is a threat like no other. It's not over yet," Vice President Jamie Richardson said.
   
 Richardson said the top priority of the money was preserving the 10,000 jobs at the family-owned chain.
   
 "We didn't want to lose one job," he said. "We want to fight for everyone who makes this their life's work.''
   
 Most of the money, combined with pay cuts taken by executives, was used for bonuses for hourly workers at its restaurants -- called the Griddle Gratitude Bonus -- and to provide premium pay for workers at its food and retail operations, he said.
   
 "We were seeing catastrophic sales losses," that since have stabilized, he said.
   
 Mills James
   
 The media production company received a loan of between $2 million and $5 million.
   
 Even with the aid, the company had to lay off some workers, said Arthur James, the company's president. The company has about 135 workers.
   
 A big part of the company's business is staging live events. It also is a production partner with the Greater Columbus Convention Center and does work for hotels and conferences.
   
 "Obviously that's been greatly impacted," he said. "Being able to have that funding, used primarily for payroll, has been helpful."
   
 Twenty One Pilots
   
 The Columbus-based band was approved for a loan between $350,000 and $1 million.
   
 The band, with central Ohioans Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, used the money to retain 19 jobs.
   
 Twenty-One Pilots was among a number of bands to be approved for loans.
   
 Rascal Flatts, which also has roots in central Ohio, received a loan along with the Eagles, Guns N' Roses, Sammy Hagar, Cheap Trick and other bands, according to media accounts.
   
 Cameron Mitchell Restaurants
   
 The restaurant company received a loan between $5 million and $10 million.
   
 The company closed all 36 of its restaurants in March because of the pandemic, laying off 4,500 workers.
   
 "We would not have made it back without the PPP loan. It was essential for us to get reopened and help us move our business forward," Cameron Mitchell, the company's founder and CEO, said in an interview with Fox Business News this week.
   
 He said the company has been able to bring back most of the workers who were let go.
   
 "We're facing just one challenge after another, and restaurants big or small or larger chains or mom-and-pops are all in the same boat and are going to need some more help I'm afraid here in the future in order for us to survive or we're going to see systemic closures of restaurants going forward."
   
 Bricker & Eckler
   
 The law firm received a loan of $2 million to $5 million that it said was used primarily for payroll for the firm's 300 workers.
   
 "It was important to us to ensure both our Bricker family and our clients are fully able to navigate the challenges that have come with this unprecedented time," the firm said.
   
 Planned Parenthood
   
 Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio received a loan of $2 million to $5 million.
   
 "For many of our patients, our local health centers are their only source of reproductive and sexual health care," the organization said. "The relief we received helps us continue meeting their health care needs during these uncertain times."
   
 Wolf's Ridge
   
 The Downtown brewery relied on a loan of between $350,000 and $1 million to pay its bills and keep some employees on payroll.
   
 "We were not receiving a lot of support from landlords in terms of deferring rent," co-founder Bob Szuter said.
   
 Additionally, the loan helped the brewery provide health insurance for its staff, even those who were furloughed, and pay higher wages as an enticement to stay on the job, even as some employees could have made more thanks to a temporary boost to unemployment benefits.

So now, Karen's got a gun.
   
 To be clear, her name wasn't actually Karen -- it was Jillian Wuestenberg. But Wuestenberg's behavior -- while with her husband, Eric Wuestenberg, she drew a gun on a black woman and her daughter in a parking lot near Detroit last week after she and the girl inadvertently collided -- is certainly Karen-like. As in the social-media meme of white women weaponizing their entitlement and privilege against people of color.
   
 Karens call police on black people for barbecuing in a public park, swimming in a public pool, selling bottled water on a public street. Amy Cooper, a New York City Karen, notoriously called 911 claiming she was being attacked in a public park by an African American man after he asked her to put her dog on a leash. Karens have become ubiquitous.
   
 But they aren't usually armed.
   
 One is wary of falling into the journalistic trope of labeling any three similar incidents a "trend." Yet, this sort of thing does seem to be happening a lot lately. Days before the Michigan confrontation, one Patricia McCloskey came out of her home in St. Louis awkwardly holding a handgun as a group of Black Lives Matter protesters marched down the street toward the mayor's house. Her husband had a long gun.
   
 Two weeks before that, Joseph Max Fucheck, a male Karen -- a Kevin? -- in Miami-Dade County pulled a gun on a black man, Dwayne Wynn. Wynn had been standing across the street from his house talking to a neighbor when Fucheck drove by and left a business card in his mailbox. When Wynn retrieved it, Fucheck circled back, produced a handgun and, in a tirade punctuated by racial slurs and other profanity, accused Wynn of stealing "my property." This, he said, is "why you have people like you getting shot."
   
 Taken together, these incidents, all caught on video, paint a grim picture of how many white Americans are responding in this summer of racial justice uprising. Namely, with the desperate panic of people who think the race war has come to their doorsteps. They're breaking out guns and circling the wagons in defense of privilege and prerogative.
   
 It's a dangerous, combustible mindset, egged on by the arsonist in the White House. Which makes one all the more thankful for those white people who have not lost their damn minds.
   
 If the police murder of George Floyd was, for many African Americans, superfluous confirmation of things we already knew, it was, for many white Americans, a jolting revelation of things they never guessed. It cannot be easy to learn that much of what you've been taught is a lie, that you are the product of a system designed to inculcate and maintain racism in you, to ensure there are voices you never hear, people you never see, stories you never know.
   
 Such a discovery can upend one's understanding of one's country and oneself. So Karen got a gun. But we'll be a better country when Karen gets a book, when she emulates morally courageous white people seeking to know things that have been withheld. They're the ones now reading Ta-Nehisi Coates, Robin DiAngelo, Michelle Alexander and Douglas A. Blackmon, the ones now watching "13th," "I Am Not Your Negro," "Do The Right Thing" and "Eyes on the Prize," the ones chanting "Black lives matter!" -- even in lily-white places where no black lives are lived.
   
 In so doing, they bring hope to a difficult crossroads of our national existence. Hard truths are being told at last and so many white people are running away from them.
   
 We are redeemed by the ones rushing toward them instead.

An Ohio University professor who faced the possibility of detenuring and removal after he was found in violation of university policy for sexual misconduct and retaliation against students retired in May under a voluntary separation agreement, according to a leaked internal memo, allowing him to amicably part ways with the university.
 As part of the voluntary separation agreement, which was offered by the university this year to 608 mostly tenured faculty members in an effort to cut back on expenses, Sunggyu Lee will receive one final installment of his $214,373 base salary paid over an 18-month period.
 He would also receive a one-time payment to cover the cost of his health care benefits, but it’s unclear if Lee was enrolled in the university’s health insurance plan because that information is protected by HIPPA law, a university spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson also declined to comment on the specifics of his separation agreement.
 Lee, a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department who was placed on paid administrative leave in 2017, was found to have violated university policy through both an investigation conducted in 2017 and 2018 by The OU Office for Equity and Civil Rights Compliance (ECRC) and a 2019 report from a University Professional Ethics Committee (UPEC).
 ECRC investigator Sara L. Trower interviewed three students and substantiated most of their allegations against Lee, including harassment, retaliatory harassment, non-consensual sexual conduct and sexual harassment by hostile environment, according to a previous report in The Athens NEWS.
 The UPEC report affirmed the conclusions that Trower’s investigation reached and determined the university had “adequate cause” to initiate loss of tenure and dismissal proceedings for Lee, according to The NEWS’ report.
 “His sexual advances toward his female students and his non-sexual, but retaliatory, behavior created an environment where students believed that saying no was not an option, and that doing so would lead to negative consequences,” the UPEC wrote at the time. “This is especially disturbing because many of the students working in his lab were international students, who had their funding and visas tied to performing satisfactorily in his lab.”
 Lee attempted to appeal the investigation’s findings in 2018, but OU President Duane Nellis denied it. Thus, the final decision on whether or not to revoke Lee’s tenure and expel him from the university was left to his college’s leadership.
 Chair of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Dr. Valerie L. Young, who on July 6 sent the memo that The NEWS obtained to members of the UPEC and Faculty Senate, said she met with Lee, his lawyer and university legal counsel in February 2019, in accordance with the faculty handbook, but was “unable to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of both parties.”
 In further accordance with the handbook, she referred the matter to her department’s Promotion and Tenure Committee (P&T), which unanimously agreed in March 2019 that the charges Trower substantiated against Lee were “serious” and that his “behavior created a hostile environment for students that was detrimental to their academic and professional development and could not be allowed to continue, and that sanction was required,” Young wrote in the memo.
 The department’s P&T committee voted 8-1 by secret ballot to detenure and dismiss Lee, the memo said.
 After reportedly reviewing the evidence herself, Young recommended in April 2019 to Dennis Irwin, who was at the time dean of The Russ College of Engineering and Technology, that Lee be detenured and dismissed. Irwin retired in summer 2019 without taking action on Young’s recommendation, according to the memo.
 The college’s new dean, Mei Wei, reportedly told Young in July 2019 that the OU Office of Legal Affairs recommended delaying the decision on whether or not to detenure and remove Lee in hopes that it could reach a settlement, the memo said.
 Lee retired on May 31 under the voluntary separation agreement before a settlement was reached, rendering his graduate faculty status terminated, according to the memo.
 His attorney, Julie Davis, passed away in March, so another lawyer from the same legal firm, Gage Gosnell II, commented on their behalf.
 "Given Dr. Lee’s election to participate in the VSRP and voluntary separation from employment with Ohio University, any and all actions against Dr. Lee potentially arising out of the August 3, 2018 Memorandum of Findings issued by OU’s Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance will no longer ensue," Gosnell wrote in an email to The NEWS.
 In a set of similar circumstances, OU quietly settled a federal sexual harassment lawsuit in May, awarding $90,000 to a graduate student for the “alleged physical and related emotional injuries” she endured at the hands of both the institution and journalism professor Yusuf Kalyango, according to a previous report in The NEWS.
 Trower’s university investigation with ECRC into Lee’s conduct found that he more than likely on one occasion grabbed a student’s buttocks while hugging and kissing her, and on another occasion hugged her so closely and tightly that “his groin was against her body,” and that she could feel his erection against her, The NEWS previously reported.
 She also charged that Lee kissed her on the neck while hugging her on a few occasions.
 “The stress and anxiety was so great that she sought medical attention to deal with it, and she also chose to change her academic program from a Ph.D. program to a master’s degree program so she could complete her degree more quickly and get out of respondent’s lab,” Trower reported at the time.
 The professor also allegedly regularly hugged and kissed a female student on the cheek, and on one occasion, put his hands on her rib cage and reportedly said ‘oh, I’m going to dangerous territory’ as his hands approached her breasts. He additionally was accused of hugging the student and kissing her on the neck and on the shoulder after trying to kiss her on the cheek on one occasion, Trower previously reported.
 Moreover, Trower found that Lee allegedly created a substantially hostile environment in his lab by capriciously favoring those who were on his good side, and completely ignoring or treating poorly those who weren’t.
 “The students’ statements that the investigator found credible report an environment in which every student repeatedly observed how very negatively respondent treated those with whom he became displeased – yelling at them, giving them the silent treatment, ignoring them for extended periods, and speaking badly about them to others,” Trower wrote.
 Trower noted multiple instances of this allegedly happening in Lee’s lab, including one occasion when Lee allegedly requested that an email exchange with a student be placed in the student’s official student folder in the department in which the student asked for a raise.
 In his defense, Lee asserted that the students were either in poor academic standing or were otherwise disgruntled with him, and were engaging in a coordinated campaign to get him fired. He even alleged that one of the students cheated on her exams at one point with another student, although Trower obtained copies of the exam in question and found that the two students’ work was “substantially different.”
 Trower said at the time she did not find that allegation to be credible.
 Lee, through his attorney Davis, denied all of those allegations at the time. He said in a statement issued in January 2019 that he believes Trower erroneously reached the conclusions she made in her report.
 “I look forward to working with my department regarding my serious concerns that the limited and erroneous findings of former ECRC investigator Sara Trower were not properly reached, and that the university process for reviewing her report has not been appropriately followed,” Lee wrote at the time. “I have been falsely accused; I have never in my long and distinguished career been accused of inappropriate touching of students, and it did not happen.
 “Ms. Trower decided to ignore the students who told her this, did not interview others who would have told her that, and did not consider evidence that these students took advantage of the current fear of sexual misconduct claims and made false accusations against a professor to benefit themselves,” he continued.
 Lee added, “The environment in my lab is not hostile – on the contrary, I have supported the academic work and careers of many fine women and men from around the world in my labs and they can attest to that. I have confidence that my colleagues at Ohio University will render a fair and responsible decision as to my actions and accomplishments with our students generally, and that I will be vindicated.”

First, as with all platforms of its kind, TikTok occasionally releases software with security vulnerabilities that need to be urgently fixed. Earlier this year, the cyber sleuths at market-leader Check Point issued a warning over a “severe” risk in the way TikTok messaged its users. TikTok patched the issue. And while that same issue would garner serious headlines now, it didn't back then. That’s unsurprising. The same Check Point team has flagged issued with Microsoft, WhatsApp and even Philips Hue lightbulbs in recent months. It’s par for the course.

The COVID-19 pandemic isn't going anywhere this summer, so the Wolf administration has released updated information concerning recreation, camps and pools for Pennsylvanians to stay safe this season.
   
 As more and more people head outdoors, Gov. Tom Wolf and the Department of Health are asking everyone to play it safe and continue to practice mitigation tactics to prevent further spread of the coronavirus.
   
 Understandably, this can be something of a challenge when the summer season is ripe with team sports, large gatherings and trips to the beach or pool.
   
 Wolf's administration originally released a series of frequently asked questions about summer recreation on May 22, though the new edition released on Thursday includes information about pools.
   
 "As we learned more about the importance of mask-wearing and listened to questions from providers and parents, we updated the FAQs so everyone involved in these summer programs understands how they may operate," Wolf said.
   
 The guidance has been updated to reflect the order of the Secretary of the Department of Health Requiring Universal Face Coverings.
   
 Some noted highlights of the revised Summer Recreation, Camps and Pools Frequently Asked Questions page include information on youth sports, summer program operations, face coverings for staff and participants in summer youth programs, and face coverings at pools.
   
 Face coverings are a requirement for coaches, athletes and spectators, unless they are outdoors and can consistently maintain social distancing of at least six feet. Athletes are not required to wear face coverings while they are actively engaged in workouts or competitions that prevent the wearing of such coverings, though they must put on a face covering when on the sidelines, in the dugout, etc., and anytime they cannot maintain six feet of social distancing.
   
 If a summer program lacks a publicly available website, alternative efforts must be used to ensure that parents and caregivers are aware of health and safety plans. Mailing the plans to all program registrants, or having written information available at a drop off or pick up location are both viable options.
   
 All staff at summer youth programs must wear face coverings during child care and summer program operations, unless they meet an exception.
   
 Staff members at summer programs should reference the Department of Health's guidance on homemade masks. More mask information, including questions about prioritizing the times of wearing face coverings, particularly for younger children; proper face covering size and fit; and providing children with frequent reminders and education on the importance and proper wearing of cloth face coverings can help answer any questions.
   
 Groups -- including both students and staff -- at summer programs should be kept the same day-to-day in order to limit the potential for community spread of COVID-19. Staggering drop off and pick up times, as well as activity times, may also help in this regard.
   
 When it comes to water, do not wear a cloth face covering while participating in activities that could lead to the covering becoming wet. A wet cloth cover can make it particularly difficult to breath. When it comes to swimming, the best bet to stay safe is to socially distance from others while in the water. When you are not swimming, wear a face covering and practice social distancing from anyone who is not part of your household.
   
 "We hope that this updated guidance helps everyone participating in summer child care and recreation programs and eliminates some of the stress and worry associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is affecting our everyday lives," Wolf said.

When Jesus describes a “good neighbor” in the New Testament, he describes someone from a rival ethnic group to good Israelites (a “good Samaritan”). He tells his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations. Jesus places justice for the poor as the centerpiece of his ministerial call (Luke 4).
 In Acts, we see God challenging mistreatment of widows of different backgrounds, and the apostles creating a system to protect the minority group that was being mistreated. We see God breaking through in challenging the church to welcome Gentiles into the family of God.
 Paul calls the church to be reconciled, places peace and cooperation of persons of different ethnic groups as the centerpiece of the books of Romans and Galatians. He calls for tolerance and acceptance of different social, racial and cultural mores, as long as the behaviors are not directly contradictory to Biblical teaching. He says regardless of gender, race or economic background we are all united as equal members of the body of Christ (Galatians 3:28).
 The history of our nation, however, bears with it a long history of racism and racial violence—often while simultaneously claiming to be acting on Christian principles. Americans fought a war over slavery, and careful students of history will know that much of the Nebraska territory was as divided on the issue as well. North Platte had a race riot in 1929. Very few places have been immune to racial or cultural conflict, including our own.

If you've been keeping a healthy distance from other people because of COVID-19, you probably feel smart. But if you're also feeling lonely and stressed, it doesn't mean anything is wrong. It could simply mean you're human.      The need to be around people is hard-wired into our brains, researchers say. We crave company in the same way we hunger for food or thirst for water. When that craving isn't satisfied, the long-term health consequences can be serious.      Luckily, the need for togetherness can be met even at a distance.      The idea that our brains drive us to be around one another has gained popularity in recent decades, said Louise Hawkley, senior research scientist at NORC at the University of Chicago.      We evolved to be around those we know and trust, she said. "Our security was in numbers. We had our safety by being around other people. We weren't particularly fast runners. We couldn't defy what nature threw at us just by speed. We had to be smart about it. Well, one of the smart things we did was we capitalized on each other's brains. We worked together."      As Lane Beckes, an associate professor in the department of psychology at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, put it: "We absolutely need other people."      Brain studies have shown how deeply this need is woven into our biology. A study in the journal Science found subjects who were excluded from a virtual ball-tossing game had more activity in the part of the brain that processes physical pain. Recently, researchers published preliminary findings on the preprint server bioRxiv that suggest loneliness triggers chemical responses in the brain similar to what's prompted by hunger.      Other research has shown serious long-term health consequences from chronic loneliness. "It turns out that being socially connected is associated with approximately a 50% reduction in the risk of early death," Beckes said. "In effect, it's similar to the reduction of risk that somebody with coronary heart disease has if they quit smoking."      A 2016 study in the journal Heart linked loneliness and social isolation to a 32% increased risk of having a stroke or developing coronary artery disease.      Beckes was part of research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology that showed how people facing a threat have lower stress responses when they're physically touching their partners or close friends. But here's an important point for those of us sitting home during the pandemic - it's not the physical company of others that defines loneliness. What matters most is that you feel as if someone has your back.      "It's not being alone," Hawkley said. "It's feeling alone" - a mismatch between what you want and what you need.      Not everybody needs the same level of connectedness, she said. "And it's a good thing, because we need those brave souls who are willing to break away from the group and be the explorers, (who) break new ground, get out there and go where no one has gone before. But there's always got to be this backstop, this return to the safe base that even the explorers need."      That sense of having a base can come in many ways, even without face-to-face contact.      "A lot of people can even live alone and be perfectly fine in part because they do things like they talk to their friends on the phone, they have Zoom conversations, they feel like other people will come to their aid" if they need help, Beckes said.      But there are limits. There's a reason those Zoom conferences feel awkward. Stress, he said, arises when our brains don't know what's happening next. Usually, we're absorbing all sorts of cues from those around us to try to anticipate what's going to happen. The absence of those nonverbal signals makes online connections more stressful.      Which is why he recommends trying to arrange in-person social contact with physical distancing - perhaps a small gathering of friends outside at a park with space between people.      Just don't ignore safety to socialize. "The health effects of loneliness and social isolation probably pale in comparison to an acute outbreak of the COVID-19 virus," Beckes said.      If in-person meetings aren't feasible, improve digital get-togethers. Try playing games online.      "When they have a shared focus, players are thinking about something besides those missing cues," he said. "Anything that sort of reduces the awkwardness and stress of interacting with other people is going to be more rewarding and, ultimately, a better source of satisfying your social need."      Hawkley said taking initiative is key. A review she helped conduct about anti- loneliness techniques that was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Review suggested the brains of lonely people get "hijacked" by negative thoughts.      She suggested making a list of people to connect with, perhaps a long-lost friend or a family member. But be deliberate about the decision.      "It may not be the be-all, end-all the first time around," she said. "But you have to find a way of feeding your social need bit by bit. And as you have successful experiences you gain more confidence. And you think, 'Yes, I can do this.'"

His impact was pretty much immediate. He brought in the missing piece of the jigsaw, Celtic’s talented midfielder Bobby Murdoch, whose legs may have all but gone but his football brain was still very much alive and his range of passing proved critical in a last hurrah at Ayresome Park.
 Charlton changed the kit, introducing a white band to the red shirt to help his players identify each other better.
 The new kit had the added bonus of giving the team a new identity a generation of supporters could identify with.
 A deep tactical thinker, Charlton came up with a style of play that was direct and effective.
 He placed great store in a tight defence but he had a midfield that boasted both silk and steel, perhaps best exemplified in Graeme Souness, a player Jack transformed from surly under-achiever into one of the greatest British footballers of his generation.
 The perception is all Boro did that promotion season was bang the ball over the top for the ‘Flying Pig’ Alan Foggon to chase.
 And while there’s an element of truth to that, there was also plenty of skill on display in the final third with David Mills chipping in with vital goals and David ‘Spike’ Armstrong offering pace in wide areas.
 Once Boro were in the top flight they found a way to not only survive but thrive.
 It’s fair to say they didn’t win too many admirers but they were well- organised, hard to beat and not too far short of winning honours.
 Legend has it Charlton had the opportunity to sign a striker that would have taken the club to the next level with David Cross of Coventry City strongly linked but he stubbornly refused to spend the £150,000 or so it would have cost to seal the deal.

The American West is about as well-trod territory as there is in movies, but Kelly Reichardt keeps unearthing new treasures.
   
 Her latest excavation, "First Cow," is her most sublime yet. Like many of Reichardt's previous films, it's set in Oregon but in a seemingly unremarkable in-between moment in history. It's a tale literally dug up. In its opening scenes, a contemporary woman and her dog are walking near a broad river where an oil tanker slowly glides past. The dog sniffs something first, then the woman sets to clawing the dirt away.
   
 Her find can only be mysterious to her; it reveals nothing for posterity or science. Just some eternal truths, and one achingly lovely yarn that reaches, through time and cinema, to today. "First Cow" leaps back to the Oregon Territory of the 1820s, where a pair of aimless and impoverished travelers are brought together by circumstance, kindness and baked goods.
   
 Otis, known as "Cookie" (John Magaro), is a cook for a band of trappers who gruffly order him around. Shortly before coming to a sparsely populated trading post, he encounters King-Lu (Orion Lee), a Chinese immigrant who, having been sought for murder, Cookie finds cowering naked behind a fern.
   
 They have an immediate rapport, and recognize in each other fellow low rungs on the already forming ladder of society. When they later encounter each other at the trading post, a tender, unspoken friendship develops between them. King-Lu invites Cookie, a shy and guileless grown orphan soulfully played by Magaro, to drink a bottle at their shack. Once there, Cookie sweetly begins to sweep the place and add a few flowers. It's as beautiful a beginning to a friendship as you're likely to see this side of "Casablanca."
   
 Friendship is indeed what "First Cow," a simple and radiant Old West fable, is about. The movie opens with a quote from William Blake about its indispensable and homely place in life: "The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship." But as a portrait of human connection, "First Cow" is situated within the rugged terrain of capitalism, even the rough and ill-formed variety found 200 years ago in the Pacific Northwest.
   
 King-Lu, the sharper schemer of the two, senses an opportunity. "History isn't here yet," he says. "It's coming but maybe this time we can take it on our own terms." The tragedy of "First Cow" is that it has, in fact, already arrived, and any momentary window of opportunity and freedom is fast closing for Cookie and King-Lu.
   
 Ordered by the area's local official (Toby Jones), the territory's first bovine (Evie, in the credits) arrives on a raft while onlookers gawk. The force of history has been heralded by many sounds before -- a railroad whistle, for instance. But I can't recall it ever before arriving with a "moo." One man jokes that the cow is no more suitable to the Oregon frontier than the white man.
   
 King-Lu, impressed by Cookie's baking, hatches a plan of udder brilliance. The two stealthily sneak milk from the cow at night, and the next morning with the otherwise impossible-to-find ingredient, Cookie whips up a rare delicacy. Their "oily cakes" sell like hot cakes, bringing daily lines of mean and mangy trappers eager for a taste. Their success stokes their dreams; King-Lu and Cookie start fantasizing about opening a hotel and bakery in San Francisco. But it also brings peril, especially once they earn the admiration of Jones' gentleman.
   
 The joys of "First Cow" are many. The thoughtful, unshowy textures of its clothes and surroundings. The fabulous chemistry of its two leads. The softly stirring guitar of William Tyler's score. All of these details add up to a wholly original western, one with its own rhythms, ideas and iconography. Like previous Reichardt films, its screen is a near-square box, which here doesn't hem in the normally widescreen landscapes of the West but reorients its focus.
   
 "First Cow" is based on the novel "The Half-Life," by Jon Raymond, a frequent collaborator of Reichardt's who wrote the script with her. Though not a household name, Reichardt has long been one of the more celebrated American filmmakers for films ("Old Joy," "Certain Women," "Meeks' Cutoff") that with a spare, untamed beauty have remapped the Pacific Northwest.
   
 Her best-known film might be "Wendy and Lucy," with Michelle Williams, about a broke drifter and her dog. They could easily be the same woman and canine who kick off "First Cow." In that way, they're a kind of modern-day echo of Cookie and King-Lu. The same struggles persist, but, thank heavens, so does companionship.

Thousands of Ohio consumers behind on their utility bills will soon face a day of reckoning.
   
 In March, as the coronavirus took hold, utilities suspended disconnections and late fees. Now utilities say it is time to get back to the way things were before the pandemic struck.
   
 Although a moratorium has halted disconnections, customers still are responsible for the accumulating balances on their bills. Many utilities also have waived late fees.
   
 Columbia Gas of Ohio said disconnections will start as soon as July 29.
   
 American Electric Power Ohio said it will resume disconnections in September, pending the approval of state regulators.
   
 Other utilities are taking or will take similar steps. Electric cooperative South Central Power, for example, said late fees and disconnections for nonpayments will resume on Aug. 3.
   
 The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio said in one case, "The Commission recognizes that, even in light of the emergency, service disconnections for non-payment cannot be suspended indefinitely."
   
 The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on Friday lifted its statewide moratorium on water shutoffs, allowing public water systems to resume disconnecting customers who don't pay their bills.
   
 The city of Columbus has not decided when to resume water shutoffs. When it does, shutoffs will take at least two months.
   
 The delinquent bills of about 54,000 city customers total $7.6 million.
   
 Consumer advocates worry about disconnections resuming.
   
 "We objected to Columbia's disconnection proposal and to the similar proposals of other utilities," Bruce Weston, the state's consumers' counsel, said in an email.
   
 "The state's suspension of utility disconnections during the pandemic has helped many Ohioans, and we fear it's too soon to resume disconnections for families across Ohio already hurting from the health and financial crisis. ... The loss of essential utility service could make people's plight more desperate."
   
 About 134,000 Columbia Gas customers were at least 60 days behind on their bills as of May, nearly double the number behind in February, before the coronavirus hit the area in full force, according to the company.
   
 Columbia Gas, AEP Ohio and other utilities are urging consumers who are behind on their bills to reach out now to set up payment plans. Columbia is sending workers to homes where residents are behind so they can provide information on how to catch up on bills.
   
 AEP Ohio said Friday that 91,000 residential customers are behind on their payments by at least 60 days, up 7,500 from a year ago. AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers.
   
 "As our state's economy begins to reopen amidst a coordinated effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19, AEP Ohio is joining other businesses across the state by taking steps to return to standard operations with a careful, phased approach," Raja Sundararajan, AEP Ohio president and chief operating officer, said in a news release.
   
 "We understand that a full economic recovery will take time, and there are customers who are still experiencing financial uncertainty."
   
 AEP is offering payment plans and waiving deposit requirements that could apply to new or existing customers. In addition, AEP's Neighbor to Neighbor program provides customers with a grant that can be applied to their bill.

Gov. Doug Ducey refused Thursday to reimpose his stay-at-home order even after conceding that his own data shows how effective that was in curbing the spread of COVID-19.
 Instead, he is putting new rules in place on how many people can sit in restaurants.
 At a press briefing, the governor acknowledged that the number of new cases each day pretty much stayed the same from the time he issued the directive in late March through the middle of May when he allowed it to expire. In fact, he said, the rate remained steady for about two weeks afterwards, the period of incubation and the time to get test results.
 Only then was there an explosion.
 Ducey's decision to stay the course — at least as far as individual activity — comes as the state added 75 new deaths on Thursday due to the virus, bringing the total now to 2,038. There were also 4,057 new cases of COVID-19; the statewide tally since the outbreak of those affected is now 112,671.
 Hospitalizations of those with positive or suspected cases also continues to set records, with the figure on Thursday at 3,471. ICU bed usage was at 861, just 10 off the record set a day earlier.
 Overall, the Department of Health Services reported 89 percent of ICU beds in use by patients of all types with 87 percent of in-patient beds in use.
 And more than 28 percent of the tests for the virus reported on Thursday came back positive.
 "I always look at the different options of where we are and what the possibilities are,'' Ducey said when asked about reimposing that stay-at-home order. "We want to do what would allow us to navigate out of the situation we are in right now.''
 Anyway, he said, there's no evidence such a move is needed right now.
 The governor said Arizona is seeing "some results'' in the last 10 days since he ordered gyms, fitness centers and bars to once again close. And in the middle of June, he gave local officials the power to mandate the use of masks but declined to make that a statewide requirement.
 But Ducey said there's also a reality that Arizonans are going to have to recognize.
 "No matter what happens, we're going to be dealing with this for some time,'' he said. That, the governor said, makes education a better alternative than mandates, which is why his but push has been his message that "you're safer at home.''
 "So the better way to do this, if possible, to have public buy-in to what is the more responsible decision, not from Mount Olympus or some government entity, but by people in a positive peer-pressure type of situation.''
 Still, Ducey is willing to impose some new rules on dine-in services -- rules that he said he got the blessing for from the Arizona Restaurant Association.
 On paper, there already are some restrictions that the governor imposed when he once again allowed in-house dining as of May 11. That included requirements to reduce the number of tables and have at least six feet between tables unless there is a Plexiglas divider.
 But aides to the governor said that became difficult to police, even to the point that there was no way to know how many tables there had been before.
 In this new directive which takes effect at 10 p.m. Saturday, the governor said dine-in facilities are now limited to half the number of people that fire inspectors have listed as capacity. So if the sign on the wall says that occupancy is limited to 80, that means no more than 40 diners, though the order exempts staffers from that cap.
 More to the point, Ducey said that both building officials and law enforcement can enforce a hard and fast number based on maximum occupancy as determined by the fire department.
 That limit does not affect outdoor dining where the risk of spreading the virus is less. But the rules remain in place for six-foot distancing between tables.
 And the latest order makes clear that any area beneath a roof counts as indoor dining, even if the entire side of the restaurant is open to the outdoors.
 Finally, the order also has a specific requirement on patrons, requiring them to be wearing a mask any time they are not seated at their table. It also prohibits people from standing around in groups, whether to wait for a table or simply go to the bathroom, and encourages the use of reservations.
 The governor denied that in allowing restaurants to remain open for in-house dining even while he is telling people to stay at home when possible is providing Arizonans with a mixed message.
 "I prioritized that you are safer at home,'' Ducey said.
 "If you're not home, you're safer outside,'' he continued. "If you're not outside, you're safer in a place with fewer people.''
 But Ducey said that shuttering restaurants for dine-in services, the way he did before, is not an option.
 "What I've said is we want to protect lives and, to the best of our ability, protect livelihoods,'' he said. Ducey said, though, that when he is in doubt "we're going to err on the side of protecting lives.''
 One thing that remains to be decided is when schools will resume — and in what form.
 The governor last month said schools can begin instruction next month according to their regular schedule, but at this point only online. He set an "aspirational'' start-up date of kids actually being back in seats of Aug. 17.
 Earlier this week, the president threatened to cut federal funding for schools that refused to accede to his demand to resume in-person instruction. At the same time, Trump criticized the guidelines put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for safely reopening schools, saying they were too tough and expensive.
 Ducey, boasting of his relationship with Trump — the governor said he set the ringer on his cell phone to play "Hail to the Chief'' when he gets a call from the White House — said he shares the president's goal.
 "We would love to see our kids back inside a school,'' the governor said. But that, Ducey said, will not be according to the president's schedule.
 "It's going to happen when it's safe,'' he said.
 Separately, Ducey said the state is making arrangements with Sonora Quest and other private lab companies to sharply increase the number of COVID-19 tests offered. Now running in the 20,000-a-day average, he said it will reach 35,000 a day by the end of July and 50,000 a day by the end of August.
