Hardy begonia is a must for a long period of either white or pink blooms. The flowers stand up above the interesting foliage and add lovely color. I have some growing in damp places as well as drier areas. If it is happy, it will seed about and give you a real show. It comes up later than other plants so do not disturb the ground in early spring or you will lose these lovely, charming plants.
 If you live in zone 7 or cooler, hardy geranium Rozanne is a top choice for color. I have it planted along a border and it blooms all summer sporting lovely violet-blue flowers. Do not get this confused with a plant that is also named geranium that is an annual. The annual geranium is quite different from the hardy geranium Rozanne.
 Hostas are at the top of the list of most shade gardeners. The array of textures, shapes and sizes of hostas are amazing. You can find some hostas that are quite large and others that are tiny. Two large ones that come to mind are Empress Wu and Sun and Substance. A true focal point for any shade garden, these giant forms are very impressive. Empress Wu can grow 4 feet tall and 7 or 8 feet wide with leaves well over 15 inches wide. Some of the small hosta plants do not get over 5 inches tall with leaves an inch wide. They do flower and can be dramatic while others are quite fragrant.
 Brunnera Jack Frost is a real winner in my book. It has lovely clouds of tiny, pale blue, airy flowers in the spring, resembling forget-me-nots. I grow this for the handsome foliage that lights up a shady spot in my garden. The heart- shaped silver leaves are edged and veined with green that remain attractive throughout the growing season. They form a dense and lush mound, which deer and rabbits resist.

Australia would be our destination with the kangaroos, aborigines and a taste of mutton.
 We made our preparations.
 Upon arrival in Sydney, we booked a room at the Australian hotel. The bathtub looked inviting, so I took a long soak and then went out to explore.
 The next night I decided to go to the Whiskey A Go Go nightclub in the Kings Cross section of town; a soldier always has priorities.
 I know you old-timers remember the Whiskey A Go Go era with dancing girls, short skirts, and those platforms, loud music, and some unique dance moves. It was a teenager’s paradise in 1967, and I was 19.
 It for sure was a place to unwind. Now I know you city folk don’t believe this old Dargan Boy could dance, and maybe he really wasn’t a very good dancer at all, but after a few libations back in those days, I could dance like Fred Astaire.
 One of the most popular songs back then was “Gimme Some Loving” by the Spencer Davis Group.
 The lights were flashing, the dance floor was crowded, and the sound system had Steve Winwood’s lyrics blaring:
 Remember the song?
 “Hey, Well my temperature’s rising; And my feet left the floor; Crazy people knocking, cause they want some more; Let me in baby I don’t know what you got; You better take it easy; This place is hot; And I’m So glad you made it; So glad you made it; You gotta Gimme some lovin’, Gimme, Gimme some lovin', Gimme some lovin' every day.”
 It was a great night. I was dancing to the beat and don’t remember exactly how I made it back to my hotel, but I did.
 I really liked Sydney but soon would be heading back to Vietnam.
 Toward the end of the week, I thought maybe I should go to church before going back, so I searched the yellow pages and the first church listed was an Apostolic Pentecostal Church.
 I dialed the number, told the preacher I was visiting from Vietnam and would like to attend a service before leaving Sydney.

I SOCCORSI   ORIAGO (MIRA) È stata per venti minuti a fianco dell'assassino. Venti terribili minuti in cui lei e lo stesso Simone Meggiato, con le mani sporche di sangue, hanno cercato in tutti i modi di rianimare Andrea Baldan che giaceva in mezzo alla strada, dopo essere stato trafitto dai due colpi di pistola di Meggiato. Gloria Baldan, giovane infermiera dell'ospedale di Dolo che vive con i genitori nella villetta a fianco dell'abitazione del 51enne ora in carcere, non aveva sentito gli spari. «È stato mio papà a svegliarmi di soprassalto - racconta -. Sono corsa in strada e mi sono gettata su quell'uomo per soccorrerlo. Paura? Mi sono solo accertata che non avessero ancora le armi e, comunque, c'era già altra gente attorno. Questo mi dava sicurezza».   CORSA IN STRADA   Vicino a lei c'era però anche Meggiato, ferito alla mano sinistra da uno dei tre colpi esplosi dalla sua Glock 9 mm. La pallottola gli è andata fuori per fuori. «Era confuso, ma cercava di rianimare la vittima - riprende Gloria Baldan, casualmente (come altri vicini) con lo stesso cognome della vittima -. Baldan non dava reazioni, già dall'inizio non sentivo più il polso ma ho subito praticato il massaggio cardiaco. Lui, Meggiato, ogni tanto gridava». Gabrio, il padre dell'infermiera, aggiunge: «Lo sentivo urlare Andrea! Andrea! Andrea!. Sì, lo chiamava per nome. E poi invocava di chiamare i carabinieri, l'ambulanza. Anch'io sono andato lì vicino, e ho dato un calcio a quella strana pistola che era stata lasciata in mezzo alla strada (si trattava di una specie di spray al peperoncino con cui Meggiato era sceso in strada assieme all'arma da fuoco, ndr.). Mia figlia cercava di salvarlo, di riportarlo in vita, ma era tutto inutile. Quando lei tirava il fiato, Meggiato cercava di fargli la respirazione bocca a bocca. Poi, quando Gloria riprendeva, lui urlava che non doveva finire così».   SANGUE DAPPERTUTTO   Passano altri interminabili minuti. Dalla mano dell'omicida continua a scendere sangue che si confonde con quello della vittima. Sull'asfalto le chiazze che verranno ripulite la mattina seguente. «Aveva del sangue in testa - racconta l'infermiera -, forse per essere caduto a terra. Non sono riuscita a capire dove le pallottole l'avessero colpito, perché in quel punto della strada c'è poca luce ed era un po' tutto sporco di sangue». Insieme, i due cercano più volte di girare il corpo ormai esanime di Andrea Baldan. «Non reagiva, non reagiva minimamente - dice ancora il padre di Gloria -. Lo giravano a pancia in giù per evitare che soffocasse. Era un uomo molto grosso. Dalla bocca gli usciva qualcosa, non so... Poi lo rimettevano disteso e riprendevano il massaggio cardiaco e la respirazione bocca a bocca».   L'ARRIVO DEI CARABINIERI   I carabinieri sono stati i primi ad arrivare sul posto. «Lì ho visti, ma ho continuato con le manovre salvavita - prosegue Gloria Baldan -. E anche Meggiato ha continuato a stare lì vicino e a cercare di salvarlo. Gli ho sentito ancora il polso, speravo che riprendesse a respirare... Niente. I carabinieri ci hanno lasciati proseguire fino all'arrivo, poco dopo, dell'ambulanza. A quel punto mi sono tirata indietro lasciando il posto ai sanitari». Ma non c'è stato nulla da fare, e Meggiato è stato subiro fermato dai militari.   «Abitiamo vicini, però io lui non lo conoscevo se non di vista, ma proprio raramente. La vittima non l'avevo mai vista - aggiunge l'infermiera -. I miei sicuramente lo conoscevano meglio. Io lavoro all'ospedale di Dolo. Avevo fatto il turno del pomeriggio, sono tornata a casa, ho cenato e sono andata a letto. Dormivo così profondamente che non ho sentito quegli spari. Sono stati i miei a correre in strada e poi, vista la scena, sono venuti a svegliarmi». Non c'è stato tanto tempo per fare ragionamenti.   «Quando ho capito che non erano armati, e con tutta la gente che c'era attorno, non ho avuto paura. E lui, l'omicida, è rimasto sempre lì anche quando sono arrivati i carabinieri. Era preso dalla situazione. Era solo confuso, tanto confuso. E piangeva».   Fulvio Fenzo   © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA

In 1993, a national group of trained meditators created an experiment with the intention to decrease the crime rate in Washington, D.C. They predicted they’d be able to reduce it by over 20% and prepared to catalog the data empirically. Before the project began, the chief of police said the only thing that would create a 20% drop in crime would be 20 inches of snow. The study occurred in summer of that year, but it didn’t snow. The crime rate began to drop immediately after the project began and continued to drop steadily until the end of it. Crime went down 23.3% below the prediction for that period of the year. Look that experiment up for yourself. Was consciousness there? If so, what does it imply about our capacity to affect physical reality on the level of our consciousness? What did those meditators affect and how?

Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the absence of a core group of customers and roadwork in the vicinity has made a rough spring for Water Street businesses and uncertainty for when things will return to normal.
 Bill Nolte, longtime owner of The Joynt, has been closed since state orders closed bars on March 17 and doesn’t have a date planned for reopening.
 “I’m not opening this bar until I can operate it like The Joynt,” he said.
 And by that he means without plexiglass barriers between bartenders and patrons, and not requiring people to wear masks or keep their distance from each other. Nolte said he respects those public health measures and sees other businesses using them to keep going, but feels it would just not fit the character his bar is known for.
 “If you can’t do it right and have it be the way it was, I just can’t do it,” he said. “I’ll wait until we don’t have to do that.”
 Nolte acknowledges that he’s financially OK with the indefinite closure as outright owner of the building, but he said many others aren’t as lucky and are continuing on under difficult circumstances.
 UW-Eau Claire students — a major group of customers for Water Street businesses — had in-person classes canceled on March 13, prompting many to leave for their hometowns and hunker down with family during the onset of the pandemic.
 Four days later restaurants and bars had to close as the state’s “safer-at- home” order took effect. The State Supreme Court put an end to that with a May 13 ruling, allowing businesses to reopen, but having to abide by local health officials rules that limit their seating capacities.
 Gradually, bars and restaurants began reopening to customers who had been themselves cooped up and looking for a night out after spending many at home since the pandemic began.
 Then on June 25, the Eau Claire City-County Health Department cautioned people of potential COVID-19 exposures at Water Street bars The Pickle and She- Nannigans earlier in the month. The next day, Brothers was added to the list.
 On top of that, the 100 block of Water Street has been closed along with portions of nearby streets, requiring some customers to follow detours to get to the businesses.
 “There is no comparison to previous years. It’s all very surreal,” said Laura Bembnister, owner of The Goat Coffee House.
 During government orders closing restaurants and taverns, the Water Street cafe opted to use that downtime to give its building a facelift.
 The construction is taking a little longer than planned, but Bambnister has some worries about customer traffic once it is complete.
 “Our hopes for the summer are first to get open!” she wrote in an email. “Then to have enough business to stay open.”
 She noted that traffic on Water Street is down significantly due to roadwork, the pandemic and fewer students around. The temporary closure of three nearby bars due to potential COVID-19 cases also weighs on her mind.
 “The spread of the virus at Water Street locations is concerning,” Bembnister wrote. “The last thing we want is to get through everything, finally open up and then have to close again. We just hope all businesses do what’s necessary to protect their patrons and employees.”
 Dooley’s Pub reopened to dine-in business on May 28, but had to go through the whiplash of an abrupt closure because of potential coronavirus exposures at other businesses.
 Owner Michael Dooley said employees had been to another Eau Claire restaurant where public health officials warned that patrons could’ve been exposed to COVID-19 on specific dates.
 In response, Dooley’s closed its doors on June 24, scaling back its operations to take-out and delivery, to check its workforce for the virus.
 “Every employee has been tested,” Dooley said in an email. “The employees will continue to be tested on a regular basis.”
 Dooley’s Pub hopes to resume dine-in business on Monday.
 Another Water Street restaurant has so far opted not to reopen its dining room.
 Brunch hot spot The Nucleus has opted to offer its food through online ordering and curbside pickup since the state shut down restaurants in mid- March.
 The limited staff at the restaurant all wear personal protective equipment during their shifts and have to do a daily health check before starting their shifts, according to Molly Wilson, communications administrator for the Pablo Group, owner of The Nucleus.
 “Our customers have been understanding throughout the process. Curbside pickup is pretty standard right now, but we look forward to the day we can all be together again,” she said in an email. “Until then, we will do what we can to keep our team and customers safe.”
 There are signs elsewhere on Water Street that the current downturn in business is expected to be temporary.
 Kwik Trip is preparing a ground floor storefront at 222 Water St. for a convenience store without gas pumps in a building that serves as a UW-Eau Claire dormitory.
 Two new buildings are currently under construction on the street, bringing new apartments and storefronts for businesses to rent.
 Nolte has a front-row seat to it all, regularly sitting in a chair outside the entrance to his closed bar so he can chat with employees and patrons who pass by.
 The loquacious 79-year-old bar owner noted that having The Joynt closed for 3½ months and counting is something unprecedented for its history.
 Even during a windstorm that cut power to the area, the bar stayed open, Nolte said.
 “I have never, ever been closed ever except Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter since 1971,” he said.
 But when it will reopen in the era of coronavirus is yet to be seen.
