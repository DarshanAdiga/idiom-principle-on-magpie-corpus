The light at the end of the tunnel moved a little closer for some health care workers at Methodist Fremont Health on Wednesday as they were among the first in the area to receive COVID-19 vaccinations.
 The hospital received approximately 200 doses of the Pfizer-BionNTech COVID-19 Vaccine from the Methodist Health System on Tuesday. In total, the health system, which encompasses three campuses between Fremont and Omaha, received 1,775 doses of the vaccine.
 Angela Meiergerd, a registered nurse at Methodist Fremont Health, was the first employee at the hospital to receive the vaccine.
 She works in the emergency room, where Meiergerd said the hospital can see anywhere from seven to 10 positive COVID-19 patients on a daily basis.

 Hello to… Brodsky/Baryshnikov  3rd - 7th May Apollo Theatre This sadly closes on 7 May but such a brief opportunity to see not only one of the greatest dancers of all time but Sex and the City legend Mikhail Baryshnikov. This one-man show is less about Baryshnikov the dancer and more about the work of Joseph Brodsky the poet. Performed in Russian with English Surtitles.  Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour 9th May, Duke of York's  This National Theatre production transfers to the West End. Lee Hall (Billy Elliott) adapts Alan Warner's novel to the stage. An uplifting and moving story of six Catholic choir girls from Oban, let loose in Edinburgh for one day only. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland 16th May, Vaults Theatre Lovely immersive theatre in the form of the Lewis Carroll story comes to Vaults. Are you more of a hat person, bunny ears or someone known for their broad grin? This labyrinth of a show is not to be missed. There is also a child-friendly version. Woyzeck 20th May, The Old Vic Harry Potter and the Cursed Child's Jack Thorne adapts this classic and if that wasn't enough to tempt you the gorgeous JOHN BOYEGA from Star Wars is in the leading role. As this actor becomes a huge star he may become less likely to tread the board so this goes from a must-see to a must-sell-your-first-born-for-a-ticket. Sand in Sandwiches 30th May, Theatre Royal Haymarket Friend/colleague of mine,  Gareth Armstrong,  directs Edward Fox in this very gentle look at John Betjeman's life as part of UK tour, having seen the production in Chichester it will amuse young and old and it is the perfect show if you are having a nice afternoon tea that day. Judy! 16th May, Arts Theatre This show was previously known as Through the Mill at the Southwark Theatre but if you saw that production you know that this is worth not only a first trip but a second, third and fourth. Three actresses depict Judy at key moments in her life. With a live band and beautiful costumes, this is the show for any Judy fan. Sadly as all these new shows waltz in like they own London's theatres we have to say goodbye to a select few. Goodbye to… Wipers Times (closes 13th May), Arts Theatre Nick Newman and Private Eye's Ian Hislop's WWI show about a satirical newspaper created amongst the mud and chaos of The Somme. Expect dry humour from Have I got News for You's captain and see it before it finishes up after a brief London visit and lengthy UK tour Carousel (closes 13th May), London Coliseum Alfie Boe and Katharine Jenkins star in this semi-staged classic in the stunning ENO venue. This limited run of 41 performances comes to an end in May.  Guards at the Taj (closes 20th May), Bush Theatre A look behind the scenes of a bloody aftermath in one of the World's most magnificent buildings; The Taj Mahal. 20, 000 workers have their hands cut off so they can never create a work as beautiful or magnificent again.  Rajiv Joseph's whimsical play about the two guards is a chance not only to explore the new Bush Theatre space but to see work by this critically acclaimed writer and director.  Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Closes 27th May), Harold Pinter Theatre Who is sad Who's Afraid…is closing? Don't miss an opportunity to see Imelda Staunton (soon to be in National Theatre's Follies) and Conleth Hill star as the couple at war as made famous by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton with Imogen Poots and Luke Treadaway as the young couple who fall in their path. A perfect accompaniment to Edward Albee's other production in the West End 'The Goat' with Damian Lewis and Sophie Okeonado  Whatever your theatre plans this May I hope there is nice weather and non-rainy bank holidays.

WARREN, N.J., Dec. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --Imagine this: A large scale construction company is contracted to build a new apartment complex across the street from a school. The final paperwork goes through, the budget was agreed upon, the building design has already hit the press, and initial work has begun. While digging, the construction company representative strikes a natural gas line hidden below the surface. The company believed they were in the clear based on records they obtained from the county from the early 1990's, and they called 811 to double check the location of what they thought were the underground utilities. Unfortunately, what both records and the results from 811 did not show was the change of direction just below where the excavator struck the ground.

Giving to others is a value Vince Royer wants his Sturgis Middle School wood shop students to learn. So again this year, he planned the "Christmas Give Back Project."
   
 Students made wooden Christmas ornaments for residents of Thurston Woods Village and delivered the wrapped gifts on Wednesday.
   
 Due to COVID-19 restrictions, student representatives met Thurston Woods administrators Carol Holmes and Jessica Leathers outside the facility, rather than give the gifts directly to residents.
   
 Student Carson Eicher said a wood-burner was used to create ornaments.
   
 Austin Crites said some students made several.
   
 They like the hands-on aspect of wood shop.
   
 "We can make things and we can make stuff to give back to the community," Quinn Goodman said.
   
 Among Royer's students, 105 students worked on the project.
   
 The final step was applying the finish, which assured the wood was sanitized, Royer said. Then, students wrapped the gifts while wearing masks and gloves.
   
 Royer is proud of the students, some of whom worked after school and on weekends to complete the ornaments.
   
 Thurston Woods staff members appreciated the students' generosity.
   
 Leathers said: "This time of year we're normally packed full of people -- every church, every community organization comes to carol with treats for everyone. This year, it's few and far between. With all the complications of the year, it's just amazing that people of the community are still reaching out to us. "

Roma, 17 dic. (Adnkronos Salute) - Un contributo di 300mila euro per sostenere i ricercatori italiani in prima fila nella lotta alle malattie genetiche rare. È la cifra che Bofrost donerà alla Fondazione Telethon. Per l'ottavo anno consecutivo l'azienda italiana della vendita a domicilio di specialità surgelate si è impegnata a dare il proprio contributo alla maratona Telethon coinvolgendo nell'azione di solidarietà i propri collaboratori e i clienti. "La cifra raccolta, infatti, è frutto della vendita di alcuni prodotti speciali natalizi e delle donazioni volontarie raccolte fra clienti nei mesi di novembre e dicembre (che è possibile effettuare ancora fino a fine 2020)", sottolinea Bofrost. "Mai come in questo periodo è chiaro quanto importante sia la ricerca, per un futuro migliore – spiega l'amministratore delegato di Bofrost Gianluca Tesolin – La collaborazione tra Bofrost e Fondazione Telethon continua ormai dal 2013. Il coinvolgimento dei nostri clienti e dei nostri collaboratori, che hanno un ruolo fondamentale nel promuovere la raccolta fondi fra le famiglie italiane servite da Bofrost, è cresciuto di anno in anno e quello con Telethon è diventato per tutti un appuntamento importante. Ringrazio tutti per l'impegno e la generosità che ci hanno permesso, quest'anno, di destinare la cifra più alta di sempre ai ricercatori che ogni giorno si impegnano con passione nella loro missione". Una catena di solidarietà che ha fatto sì che da San Vito al Tagliamento (Pn), dove ha sede Bofrost, in otto anni sia arrivato a Telethon oltre un milione di euro. La raccolta fondi si chiuderà il 31 dicembre ma la consegna simbolica della donazione di Bofrost avverrà durante la maratona televisiva di sabato 19 dicembre su RaiUno. "Riteniamo che ogni azienda debba essere attenta all'ambiente dove opera aiutando e supportando iniziative che hanno un importante impatto sociale – conclude Tesolin –. Per fare questo è importante trovare un partner serio e affidabile come Fondazione Telethon, la cui serietà ed efficacia sono comprovate. In questo modo è possibile raggiungere grandi risultati su temi importantissimi che riguardano tutti noi, come il progresso scientifico e la tutela della salute".

In totaal verschenen van McCartney inmiddels vijftien solo-albums, maar de drie die zijn eigen naam dragen, maakte hij werkelijk solo, in zijn eentje alle instrumenten spelend. Deze albums worden vaak beschouwd als berichten van het thuisfront. Zo zong hij op die uit 1970 over zijn vrouw, ’Lovely Linda’. Op het nieuwe album klinkt hij huiselijk in slotnummer ‘When Winter Comes’, waarin hij laat weten dat het hek van de tuin kapot is en er vossen zijn gesignaleerd. Hij wil ook drainage aanleggen in het wortelbed, anders zal de groente verrotten. Maar afgezien van zijn zorgen om ‘de lammeren en de kippen’, laat McCartney zich op _III_ kennen als een joyeuze man (‘We can throw a party every night’) en een uitbundige muzikant die zelfs een kinderlijk rijmpje over ‘dinosaurs and Santa Claus’ nog een uitbundige draai weet te geven in ‘Seize The Day’.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The federal government granted Florida’s request for wider authority over wetland development, a move that came under immediate fire by environmentalist who worry that the country's largest network of wetlands could be at risk of being further destroyed. The announcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was long sought by developers and Republican allies, who argued that the layers of regulatory scrutiny were cumbersome, expensive and unnecessary. Supporters touted the move as a step that would streamline the permitting process when property owners seek to develop wetlands. Florida accounts for about a fifth of the country’s wetlands and includes the Everglades, among the state's most important environmental jewels. At around statehood in 1845, the state had 20.3 million acres of wetlands By 1996, Florida has lost nearly half of that because of dredging, draining and filling. The state's population growth has spawned a boom in development, which has prompted much of that destruction. Wetlands serve a key role in the ecosystem, including in helping maintain water quality and absorbing flood waters. “We are passionate about our resources in the state of Florida. Whenever we can have our team of scientists and permitters issue the permits that allows us to be in the driver's seat, that's what we want to do,” said Florida's secretary of environmental protection, Noah Valenstein, who traveled to Washington for Thursday's announcement. Valenstein said the state would respect the “the underpinnings and protections of law and the Clean Water Act” but sought to use his department's local expertise to drive development decisions. But that worries environmental groups who say they may have fewer venues — possibly including...

RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Palestinian prime minister has announced a two- week lockdown in the West Bank that appears certain to curtail Christmas celebrations in the town of Jesus’ birth. He said on Thursday that the lockdown is needed because of a coronavirus outbreak and that there will be a nighttime curfew throughout the West Bank. On weekends, the curfew will be around the clock. The restrictions mean that celebrations in Bethlehem will be greatly scaled back or even canceled, though the prime minister says “protocols” are still being worked out for public prayers. Local officials have already scaled back plans and hotels and gift stores are closed due to the outbreak.
