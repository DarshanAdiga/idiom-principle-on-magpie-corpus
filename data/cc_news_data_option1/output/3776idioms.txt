Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

Moreover, there’s a broad sense of outrage this year among people, even once- unlikely Trump supporters, who are fed-up with annoying left-wing ankle- biting, with the media’s childish anti-Trump hysteria, and with four years of Democrats’ nonstop efforts to overthrow an elected president.
 Because Trump backers and Republican-registered Never Trumpers generally agree that Democrats cannot be trusted to run America, it’s unimaginable that an ancient grudge could make any true or leaning conservative consider voting for a Democrat. Nevertheless, even though the Democrats’ socialist wing has hijacked their platform and forced their nominee to adopt radical positions, some Never Trump Republicans inexplicably support Joe Biden.
 Biden’s Democratic Party stands in active opposition to every conservative core value, including, but not limited to fiscal and personal responsibility, First and Second Amendment rights, free markets, private health insurance/medical care, conventional energy, law and order, secure borders and the sanctity of life.
 An Issues and Insights editorial sagely observed, “Any self-described conservative who thinks that the wreckage caused by Biden’s far-left agenda can simply be undone by a (socially acceptable) conservative somewhere down the road is fooling themselves.
 “Once in place, government programs, even supposedly temporary ones, are impossible to eradicate. As [economist] Milton Friedman…put it: ‘Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.’”
 Furthermore, Democrats embrace a “cancel culture” that dictates how people may think, act, speak, and where and with whom they may congregate; they engage in divisive identity politics stoked by press allies and social media; and the party’s violent, militarized wing has used contrived grievances as excuses to loot and torch corruptly-misgoverned Democrat-run cities. Militants’ future ambitions include America’s suburbs.
 After Democrats finally caught on that months of denying and tacitly, sometimes openly supporting left-liberal rioting were hurting them, Biden and others began shamelessly — psychotically — blaming President Trump for their side’s lawless urban violence.
 It’s fair for conservatives to apply the same standards to a Republican president as they do to Democrats; it’s acceptable to criticize the president when he’s wrong; but, it’s essential to support him when he’s right, and focus on the larger, more important conservative objectives in President Trump’s policy portfolio.
 Genuinely-conservative Never Trumpers will reunite with Trump voters — Republicans, Independents and traditional Democrats — to embrace commonly-held goals, preserve already-won policy gains and continue America’s progress.
 Intractable Never Trumpers have no political future. Conservative Republicans don’t like turncoats, and Democrats will just use, then discard them.

 Leonard McIlhone of Neenah has claimed the winning ticket. McIlhone is a long- time Megabucks player who plans to put in his two weeks and retire early from his job.
 "Wow, what a win for Leonard and Mobil!" exclaimed Wisconsin Lottery Director Cindy Polzin. "Megabucks is a Wisconsin-only jackpot game that players really love and we're happy this long-time player hit the jackpot."
 The last Megabucks jackpot of $10.7 Million annuity was won on April 25, 2020, and claimed by a Merrillian man.
 Wisconsin Lottery retailers who sell winning tickets over $599 receive a 2% incentive up to $100,000. Mobil will receive $38,000 for selling the ticket.
 The odds of winning the Megabucks jackpot are 1 in 6,991,908. Megabucks drawings are Wednesday and Saturday. Each set of two plays cost $1 per draw. Tickets must be purchased before 9 p.m. on Wednesday and Saturday to be included in that day's drawing.

 Multiple games have experienced delays for various reasons during the coronavirus-shortened season. For example, the Minnesota Twins and Pittsburgh Pirates faced off in early August but had to temporarily stop their game. An unidentified individual flew a drone over the field and brought the action to a halt.
 The incident occurred when Twins pitcher Jose Berrios stood on the mound looking to retire the Pirates. The Twins registered two outs but left the field before Berrios could strike out a batter. Both teams expressed frustration as they sat in the dugout, waiting for the game to resume. Some players even tried throwing baseballs at the drone in an effort to knock it out of the sky.

 The game ultimately resumed after a delay. The drone flew high into the air over center field and then headed for the parking lot. It headed toward the parking lot and disappeared, prompting the umpire to resume the action on the ground.
 Both teams expressed frustration during the delay with tweets about the drone. "We are in a...drone delay. We don't know. AL baseball is weird," the Pirates tweeted. The Twins also weighed in after the drone left, expressing frustration about the season. "2020 baseball, man. Play ball, again," the organization wrote.

Gold is testing critical support as theUS dollar shows there is still some life to it. The stimulus is now fading which is a hurdle for the bullish trend in gold. Gold prices are testing the bull's commitmentsat the support structure around $1,906 in what could be a final test before the next leg higher of the bullish trend. At the time of writing, gold, XAU/USD, is trading at the lows of the day, $1,905, having travelled from a high of $1,955.62, down some 2% to start the week. Gold prices have been in consolidation since correcting from all-timehighs in late Julyand subsequentlyprinting a low of 1861 at the start of August. The price has chopped sideways, decelerating its daily range as markets try to get a handle on the various features of today's market conditions. One of the main drivers for precious metals has been the notion that real rates will be lower for longer as the Fed maintainsa dovish outlook for several years ahead with inflation grounded. However, with such sentiment already priced in, bloating positioningdata could be a hurdle for the bulls at this juncture. The stimulus is now fading Given that the positioning data reflected expectations that Federal Open market Committeeofficials would strike a more dovish tone and suggest changes to the QE program, which they did not, we could be seeing some disappointments in the price action now. Meanwhile, a surge in the US dollar has not helped the spot market at the start of this week. The DXY is trading at 93.66 and higher by some 0.7%. With fiscal stimulus still in question, even more so following the death of JusticeRuth Bader Ginsburg, theprobability that a Phase 4 deal would not be dropped before the election. This should underpin the greenback because investors are less likely to take on risk until a fresh stimulus deal is struck. The single currency, the euro, should also be monitored as it feels the pressure of a second waveof the coronavirus on mainland Europe. The European Central Bank is in focus this week following the Financial Times publishing of a source's story that the ECB will launch a review of its PEPP programme. TheECB intends to examine the length of the PEPP set for June 2021 but also look at transferring its flexibility to other purchase programmes. It is still not clear if this will be a dovish or hawkish outcome, but given the risks of the second wave of the virus which will clash with flu season, the chances are the ECB could well be considering caring the tool into other programmes which would be dovish. On the other hand,PEPP would not be used in full, it will be hawkish and significantly weigh on the US dollar, likely supporting the bullish case for boththe euro and gold.

L'Italia è stato il Paese che ha reagito con maggiore fermezza rispetto a tutti gli altri Paesi, ha poi aggiunto facendo un confronto con gli altri Paesi, come ad esempio la Francia, "dove - ha detto - persistono a ritenere volontaria la possibilità di isolamento in caso di positività, mentre da noi la quarantena è obbligatoria".

This news comes in tandem with a state-by-state breakdown released by the Internal Revenue Service showing the number of people around the country who for whatever reason haven't taken action to claim their stimulus check, which includes some pretty big numbers overall. For example, almost 5% of the entire population of Washington DC hasn't claimed its stimulus check yet, according to the new IRS numbers, and the same goes for 4.2% of the population of the state of Alaska.

While Eve is in London and Osbourne is forced to quarantine after one of her granddaughters was diagnosed with COVID-19, both tuned in via remote and anticipate on returning in the future. In an exclusive interview with _PopCulture.com_ , Inaba not only expressed her excitement for their in-studio return, but gushed over her co- hosts, revealing how much she learns from them due to their different backgrounds, opinions and views. She detailed that no matter how different their thoughts, they all find respectful ways to express them and still be friends at the end of the day.
 "That's what's so great about this job," Inaba said. "I love being on _The Talk_ because I learn how to cope with my life better through conversations with the other ladies, through the topics that we bring up, and from the audience as well. Sometimes they respond to what we're talking about via social media and I learn things from what they say as well. In this day and age we need to be talking about connecting and trying to understand each other better. That's what we like to do out here at _The Talk._ "
 Inaba was introduced as a full-time host in 2019 after filling the spot of Julie Chen Moonves. The _Dancing with the Stars_ judge expressed that in this day in age, people are so divided, but their goal on the hit CBS daytime talk show is to bring people together while also sharing different points of view. "In this day and age, people are very separated. We are living in a society where people are very separated by their opinions. And what we want [...] is how to have conversations from different backgrounds and make it something so that we grow and we find connection as opposed to creating more distance."
 She continued, "I mean with Eve, Sheryl, Sharon and myself, we all come from very different backgrounds, and yet we are able to sit on this panel and to judge things and have different opinions, but still find a way to not end up in an argument or create a clash." Inaba and the rest of the _The Talk_ cast will be introducing four new segments to this season: "Daily Catch Up," "The Talk Talks Back," "Eat Up," and "Feel Good Fridays."

 Inaba will rejoin her co-hosts in the studio after being apart for seven months and she is more than thrilled about it. "Oh my gosh, I'm so excited [...] it's been a few months now and I think too many. I missed the ladies!" She gushed how good of friends they all are both on and off-air, and said that's she's looking forward to the new season.

NORRISTOWN — A Norristown man received some time behind bars when he admitted that he failed to stop after being involved in vehicle crashes in West Norriton and Lower Providence and fled from police during one of the incidents.
 Timothy Williams Jr., 28, who listed addresses in the 500 block of West Lafayette Street and the 500 block of Kohn Street, was sentenced in Montgomery County Court to 75 days to 23 months in the county jail after he pleaded guilty to charges of accidents involving damage to attended vehicles or property and fleeing or attempting to elude police in connection with two incidents that occurred between April and May 2018.
 Judge Thomas C. Branca, who accepted a plea agreement in the case, also ordered Williams to complete one year of probation following parole, meaning he will be under court supervision for about three years.

This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate. The module will also teach students to nuance standard maritime historiographies through literary reading practices, as well as evaluate the metaphoric application of piracy to contemporary, interruptive, economic practices.

BBVA se asoció con BNP Paribas, ING, Société Générale y Standard Chartered para alinear sus carteras de crédito con los Acuerdos de París sobre cambio climático. Los cinco bancos -conocidos ahora como “Los bancos de Katowice”- han elaborado un informe que ofrece una metodología para reconfigurar sus carteras de cara a financiar empresas que produzcan menos emisiones de carbono, indicó el diario español CincoDías en su portal. La intención de esta iniciativa es que todas las entidades, que así lo deseen, puedan adherirse a ella y los stakeholders cuenten con elementos homogéneos y comparables sobre las carteras de financiación a empresas y la exposición de los bancos a riesgos medioambientales. Asimismo, de cara al futuro, otro de los objetivos es establecer umbrales máximos en cuanto a porcentajes dedicados a financiar sectores económicos responsables del impacto climático, como aquellos intensivos en combustibles fósiles. De esta forma, las cinco empresas buscan reducir el peso que tienen estos sectores y empresas en las carteras de crédito a nivel global. “La metodología propuesta en el informe permitirá a las entidades financieras conocer mejor a sus clientes. El proceso de transmisión del riesgo climático en las actividades productivas es complejo y varía sustancialmente entre sectores. Por ello, la identificación de las variables principales que lo incrementan o reducen es fundamental”, señaló Ricardo Laiseca, responsable de la Oficina Global de Sostenibilidad de BBVA. Precisó, además, que esta metodología para evaluar las carteras se basa en una herramienta de código abierto (por ello lo puede adoptar cualquier entidad) desarrollada por el think tank 2DII y en cuyo diseño han participado instituciones académicas, expertos del sector y ONG. Agregó que es un hito que cinco grandes bancos globales se hayan puesto a trabajar de forma colaborativa para publicar este informe y estén avanzando conjuntamente en la selección de métricas que ayuden a cumplir con los objetivos de París. “En definitiva, estamos anunciando que incorporamos el riesgo climático en la gestión de todos nuestros negocios”, concluyó Laiseca.

USD/CHF is trading 0.41% higher on Monday. CHF has not been trading in line with the risk sentiment. USD/CHF daily chart In the past when stock markets take a dive CHF and JPY is where the flow of money would normally be headed. In this new normal the greenback has outperformed and acts as a safe haven. Today has been no different, the dollar is 0.41% higher against CHF and 0.26% higher against the yen and the world major indices are in the red. Looking at the chart, it looks like a key reversal is taking place. The high lows have been marked out by the black circles. Now the previous wave high needs to be broken at 0.92 for confirmation. Even if this break continues to the upside, there is some traffic above the current price level. There are two trendlines marked in black that could be targeted by the bulls. There is also the psychological 0.93 area that has been sticky in the past. The indicators are also looking pretty bullish at the moment too. The MACD histogram is in the green and it looks like the signal lines are above to follow and push over the zero level too. The Relative Strength Index is above 50 and there is still some space to move to the upside. This downtrend is not over just yet. The market could start to make consecutive higher highs and higher lows from here and the confirmation of that will mark the change of trend.

As with many Honda products, the Passport includes several thoughtful interior elements. Rear-seat passengers have access to a total of eight cupholders, and the ones mounted on the door armrests are especially useful for children. The second-row seats are heated in the outboard positions in all but the base grade and also fold very flat to create a level load floor for a total of 2,854 litres of cargo space with the seats down and an impressive 1,430 litres with them up. That said, the space back here is relatively dark due to the all-black interior and the smaller sunroof.

The Atlanta Falcons lost a game on Sunday that literally no other NFL team would lose. They became the first team (since turnovers were tracked in 1933) to score at least 39 points with no turnovers and lose. They blew a 20-0 lead. They blew a 15-point lead with five minutes to go. They watched an onside kick slowly roll 10 yards instead of simply picking the ball up.
