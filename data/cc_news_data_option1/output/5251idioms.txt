Plans for the construction of the new state-of-the-art Basseterre High School (BHS) at Pond’s Extension in East Basseterre will begin in early 2021, says Minister of Education, the Honourable Jonel Powell, during the continuation of the Budget Debate on December 18.  Minister Powell noted that the construction has taken longer than anticipated. However, he is satisfied that the delays were for a good reason.“We must ensure that in building an institution of this magnitude that it is done properly, that all the I’s are dotted all the T’s are crossed and at the end of the day what we have is a school that will last for a very long time and that would set a new standard not just in St. Kitts and Nevis, but across the Caribbean Region,” he said.The Education Minister said that despite political naysayers “we are satisfied that this is the right thing to do and we will do it.”The Minister stated that the designated location is an ideal place to build the school.“I’m satisfied that it is a safe place to build it,” he said. “I’m satisfied that the economic benefits will be tremendous not just to that area but to the whole country. I’m satisfied that all who have tried to play politics to the building of that school will benefit from the same school and will revel in the successes of that school.”Minister Powell said that he is looking forward to the support of the Cabinet and the Education Sector to ensure that the school becomes the new standard and that he hopes to propel other schools across the Federation to that level. -30-

That’s what made Tiger’s resurgence in 2018 so thrilling, and why that summer he electrified crowds from Tampa to D.C. to St. Louis. It was so _unexpected_ , not just for his legion of fans, but also for Tiger and his own family. His kids were on-hand for the close call at Carnoustie, when he took the lead heading into the back nine but stumbled coming home. That loss, for the first time, crushed them. As he told them afterward: “Hopefully you’re proud of your pops for trying as hard as I did.”

Flexacoin holders can migrate to the new token on a one-to-one basis through the official portal. Spalding said FXC was often mistaken for a payment token itself; the ERC-20 style token is merely infrastructure for the Flexa Network.

A man stopped for trespassing was arrested after deputies found drugs in his possession.
 On Dec. 20, Cherokee County Sheriff's Deputy James Carver was dispatched to North 427 Road on a report of stalking or trespassing. The caller said Chris Lyons had been on her property the day before, and now he was back. Dispatch advised Lyons was wearing tan-colored pants. Carver came across Lyons on Lost City Road. Lyons was holding a blue bag and dropped the bag in the ditch before he approached the deputy. Lyons kept putting his left hand in his pocket and Carver told him to take his hand out, but he placed his hand in his pocket a second time. Lyons said he was looking for a friend and spoke with a woman. Carver asked if he was on someone's property, and Lyons said he didn't think so. Lyons was asked what was in the bag and he claimed it was food. He gave Carver permission to search the bag. Carver found four bags of marijuana and a light bulb used as a smoking device. Lyons was arrested for possession of marijuana without a valid prescription, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and trespassing after being forbidden. Carver ran a criminal history record on Lyons and found several drug-related charges.
 Deputy Jimmy Tannehill responded to the Log Store on Dec. 20 for a disturbance. An employee said Misty Vaughan was inside for hours and was asked several times to leave. The employee said Vaughan cursed and yelled at several customers and him. Vaughan told Tannehill she had no one to pick her up and admitted to drinking vodka. Vaughan was arrested for public intoxication and told the deputy she didn't have any drugs, weapons or needles on her. Jail officers searched Vaughan and found marijuana and glass pipes containing a white substance. Vaughan said she didn't know marijuana was considered a drug. She was booked on charges of public intoxication and bringing contraband into a penal institute.

Jim Alexander is an Inland Empire native who started with his hometown newspaper, The Press-Enterprise, longer ago than he cares to admit. He's been a sports columnist off and on since 1992, and a full-time columnist since 2010. Yes, he's opinionated, but no, that's not the only club in his bag. He's covered every major league and major sports beat in Southern California over the years, so not much surprises him any more. (And he and Justin Turner have this in common: Both attended Cal State Fullerton. Jim has no plans to replicate Turner's beard.)

En González la indicada para mantener la hegemonía del PAN es la actual gerente de la Comapa Gabriela Verlage, pese a los ataques orquestados por el alcalde (y pariente) Guillermo Verlage, cuyo plan B es mandar a la boleta a su mujer Inés Duarte por Movimiento Ciudadano.

To say that Cyberpunk 2077 has gotten off to a troubled start is putting it mildly. Bugs and glitches abound, performance on previous-gen consoles is quite terrible, and even on PC, you'll want a fairly potent rig. We've looked at GPU performance , CPU scaling , and even RAM requirements . Meanwhile, the v1.05 patch arrived for PC on Dec. 20 and could potentially invalidate previous benchmarks, so we wanted to do a quick sanity check. There's no sense in putting in dozens of hours of testing if…
