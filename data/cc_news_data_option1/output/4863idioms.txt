Motzer met his wife of 68 years, Bea, in college.
 After the Air Force, Motzer began his studies to be a minister. He was ordained a deacon in the Methodist Church but didn’t continue his studies due to his wife’s health.
 He sold insurance for 10 years before beginning a 40-year career in pharmaceutical sales. After taking early retirement, he worked for 11 years as a teacher’s aide in the Fisher school district as a job coach for special- education students. He retired last year.
 He used to golf, but severe spinal stenosis eliminated that hobby. He is still able to garden, something he does every day the weather is fit.
 “I’m just blessed that I can still do a lot of the things I want to,” Motzer said.
 Motzer and his wife live in Fisher and have been active in the community. He directed traffic at Fisher football games for several years and called the games for 45 years. He kept stats for the basketball team for 35 years and was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame as a friend of basketball in 2007.
 His life as a superhero (Santa) began 42 years ago. For years he has played that role at Dewey Bank, where his wife serves as vice president, Milford Citizens Bank and a bank in Libertyville, where his daughter-in-law works. He’s played the role in several Midwestern states and as far away as Colorado.
 “Word of mouth would get around, and people would want to know if I would be Santa,” he said.
