Broadly, fuzes function on impact (percussion fuzes) or at a pre-determined time after firing (time fuzes). Explosives and tactical weapons are fireworks for blast operations. The blasting safety fuse used to shoot an explosive from a distance or after a delay is a hollow cord packed with a combination of black powder and intended to disperse burning at a slow and steady pace. In 1940, it was widely calculated that for every 2500 rounds good anti-aircraft had brought down one plane. Time fuzes are equipped for targets such as rockets, warheads, ships at sea and ground forces. They provide a more complex trigger mechanism than a common touch fuze or timed fuse. Also, time fuse helps to produce air blows against ground targets. When it strikes the ground, a contact fuze explodes; the dispersal of the shrapnel is not very effective.

David Wickson's first experience with the game of soccer could only be described as painful. But fortunately for a couple of generations of youth soccer players in Plymouth, this week's 50-for-50 profile stuck with the process and developed a true appreciation for the beautiful game.
 "I was actually a baseball player," the 74-year-old Newton native said. "I played baseball at Drew University, and the first time I ever played soccer was during a pick-up game at the college. My soccer playing career ended that day with a broken ankle."
 Wickson fortunately held no long-standing grudges against the sport for his injury. He eventually coached soccer at one time or another at Plymouth North, Plymouth South as well as Carver High and was a game official for more than 40 years at the youth and high school level before hanging up his whistle for good last month.
 And it all started because he wanted to be a good dad.
 "Rich Tocci and Tom Foley were just getting the Plymouth Youth Soccer league going at that point, and my daughter Jennifer was interested in playing. So I told them I'd help out any way I could in getting the girls league up and running," David recalled. "I didn't know much about soccer at the start, but 40 years later I developed a love for the game."
 As they say, no good deed goes unpunished, and the league organizers took Wickson up on his offer. After giving it some thought, Wickson, who worked as a traveling medical sales representative before retiring, devised a plan to play catch-up on a sport he knew very little about.
 "I thought the best way to understand the sport was to earn my referee license and learn all the rules of the game from that angle," he explained.
 David got a tremendous amount of use from his referee license. He estimated that he officiated somewhere around 10,000 youth, high school and adult soccer games over the years.
 "The more games you officiate, I think things start to slow down for you," David explained. "You start to develop a keener eye for what is an actual foul and what might be a flop, as well as the ways that you as an official can help keep the flow of the game going."
 Plymouth native and Bristol Community College Women's Soccer Head Coach Jason Tassinari and Wickson have shared a lifetime's worth of memories on the soccer pitch.
 "I think David refereed my first youth soccer game back when I was around 8 at the old West Elementary School field," Tassinari said. "He was always a very loyal guy, and I think the way that he learned the game as an on-field official really helped him hone in on teaching different aspects of the game as a coach."
 When Tassinari took over as the girls coach at Carver High in the mid-2000s he brought along Wickson as his JV coach. David was also the head coach at Plymouth South for a time and was the freshman coach under Dennis Azevedo for several years at Plymouth North.
 "David was a great girls coach. He had a way of connecting with his players and getting the most out of them," Tassinari said. "He was the ultimate high school sub-varsity head coach. David was able to prepare his kids so well for the varsity program and give them that final finishing touch on their skills to put them over the top. He was a huge part of my program."
 Azevedo said Wickson "exuded a passion for the game of soccer. He was a big part of the foundation for the success we had with the program during that time."
 Tassinari and Wickson officiated countless games together at the Jungleplex, developing a friendship that's still strong today. The Jungleplex building is in the process of transitioning to a storage facility, and the plan was for Tassinari and Wickson to combine and officiate one final game together that would be the last at the sports facility as well as Wickson's final game as a referee.
 Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic changed all the plans and the facility closed its doors earlier than expected.
 "It was a great run," Wickson said. "I developed some great friendships over the years."
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Camden is taking a different approach to ensure their students are fed. They have partnered with the Food for Thought organization in Taberg, which is delivering family food boxes to more than 400 students from 260 families each week. The district purchased 4,500 pounds of canned soup and vegetables to support the deliveries and plans to purchase fresh produce and other items moving forward. In addition, about a dozen district employees are volunteering at Food for Thought.

Estados Unidos. La actriz estadounidense Debi Mazar publicó este sábado un pequeño mensaje patrocinado por el ayuntamiento de Nueva York, en el que insta a los neoyorquinos a quedarse en casa y a taparse la nariz y la boca con una bufanda o un pañuelo si tienen que salir a la calle. “Hola, soy Debi Mazar y exhorto a todos los neoyorquinos a que, por favor, se queden en casa”, dijo la actriz que representaba a Ava Gardner en la serie “Arde Madrid” creada por Paco León y Anna Costa. La artista reconoce que “son tiempos de reto y de mucho miedo” y continua asegurando que aunque los neoyorquinos “son duros”, “COVID-19 no es una broma y no hace distinciones”. “Si tienes que salir a la calle, por favor, ponte una máscara de papel, una bufanda o cualquier cosa. Mantente cubierto mantente sano”, sostuvo Mazar. El alcalde de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, recomendó el jueves a los neoyorquinos que empezaran a cubrirse la boca y la nariz cuando salgan a la calle, con algún material de tela o de papel para contribuir a la ralentización de la expansión del coronavirus. “La razón de esta recomendación es porque los estudios están mostrando que al parecer algunas personas asintomáticas y presintomáticas están transmitiendo esta enfermedad. No tenemos evidencias perfectas (...), pero cada vez parece más evidente”, dijo De Blasio en una conferencia de prensa en la que aconsejó ponerse una bufanda, un pañuelo de la cabeza o un trozo de tela. Esta nueva medida se suma a las ya existentes de mantener una distancia social de dos metros, lavarse las manos con jabón durante 20 segundos, toser o estornudar en el ángulo interno del codo y salir a la calle solo por cuestiones necesarias. Unos consejos que las autoridades recuerdan constantemente a través de anuncios, letreros luminosos y los altavoces del Metro tanto en inglés como en español. En el breve video de menos de un minuto colgado en la cuenta de Twitter del Ayuntamiento, Gardner también recuerda que el 80 por ciento de la gente contagiada se cura sin necesidad de intervención médica y pide a la gente que sólo vaya a los hospitales únicamente si tienen dificultades para respirar. Numerosos famosos han animado desde comienzo de la crisis sanitaria a los estadounidenses a respetar las medidas para evitar la expansión del COVID-19. Según las últimos datos, la ciudad de Nueva York tiene 57.159 casos confirmados del COVID-19 y más de 1.500 personas han perdido la vida, mientras los contagios en todo EE.UU. superan ya los 275.000 y los fallecidos son al menos 7.067.

There are some hard times ahead yet. There are obstacles we are going to need to overcome. There are behaviors we are going to need to change which will cause us periodic discomfort. Isn’t that true at any time in life though? Our current situation has just brought it into a very sharp focus in a very short period, so we are forced to take notice. Imagine how different and wonderful things will be when we come out on the other side of this to the “future with hope” God promises us. Take heart that our God is with us in this season of Lent when nothing is happening the way it has in the past and we are forced to take stock of what is truly important to us.
 Take time to pray for others; to show love and compassion where and how you are able. Know our God is here with us now and we can trust there is a future with hope ahead. Be safe in our time apart so we might enjoy once again being together in that future. Dream of new ways to be together and let your spirits soar on the winds of hope as you look at the beauty of these new discoveries even in our current discomfort. Peace and God bless you all until we meet again!

In light of COVID-19, the Wisconsin Conservation Congress (WCC) and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) are closely following guidelines from the Department of Health Services (DHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO).
 We continue to receive the most up-to-date information, including new guidance from DHS that recommends canceling or postponing gatherings of 50 people or more to help protect Wisconsinites from the spread of COVID-19, particularly those who are most vulnerable to infection and severe disease.
 As such, the in person portion of the 72 public meetings known as the Spring Hearings that were to be held in each county April 13 are canceled. The public will continue to have the opportunity to provide input on the natural resources advisory questions from the DNR, Natural Resources Board (NRB), and WCC through the online input option.
