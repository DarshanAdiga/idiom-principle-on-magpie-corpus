Clinching his seventh pole position this season, title defender Joshua Rogers once again underlined his qualifying prowess. Due to the reverse starting order, as stipulated by the regulations, he took up the sprint race from P8. His closest rival Sebastian Job started from the sixth grid spot. At the front of the field, Mitchell DeJong (USA/VRS Coanda Simsport) defended his top spot from Red Bull Racing Esport driver Graham Carroll and Finland’s Tuomas Tähtelä (Logitech G Altus eSports). At the green light, Rogers immediately attacked. By lap two, he had moved up to seventh place and waited in Sebastian Job’s slipstream for his chance. The pair put on a spectacular show, swapping positions several times. In the end, Roger’s prevailed and promptly went in pursuit of his teammate Tommy Östgaard. In the last lap, Rogers pulled past the Norwegian on the long Mulsanne straight into fifth place. With full commitment and strong overtaking manoeuvres, the Australian fought his way forward to second position in a dramatic final phase marked by several collisions. Thanks to this performance, he kept his chances for the championship title open. Job crossed the finish line in fourth behind Graham Carroll. At the front of the pack, Mitchell DeJong celebrated his first win of the season.
