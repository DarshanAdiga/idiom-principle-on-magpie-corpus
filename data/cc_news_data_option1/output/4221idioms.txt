In my experience, dissent and protest are soft weapons for compelling leaders to come to the table for negotiations with aggrieved parties. And it seems to me like the government is now ready for a round table negotiation with the youths. The anger of the youths are palpable for all to see and feel , just as the energization and galvanization of their collective power can not be denied. But the massive power that they posses, of which they are now wielding, shouldn’t give them the Dutch courage of engaging government in a do or die affair or put them in a fight to finish mode.

President Muhamadu Buhari may not perceive how a few Democratic steps that he has taken in the past couple of weeks as policies have boosted his democratic credentials. Positive actions such as allowing the Edo state governorship election to hold without a sleight of hand that could have facilitated rigging the votes in favor of his party’s candidate; allowing free and fair election to hold in Ondo state , and by listening to the voice of the youths to dissolve SARS, are major milestones that have enhanced his democratic ethos that were in tatters following amongst other civil rights abuses , the arrest and detention of #Revolution Now protesters, led by Omoyele Sowore. The foregoing , along with the other human rights abuses on citizens seeking to eke out a living by security agencies, recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown of the economy and even the outcome of the general elections in 2019, which a broad spectrum of Nigerians regard as dubious, drained all the balance of goodwill that he had in his account.

Japan said on Tuesday it would take countermeasures to ensure next year's Tokyo Olympics are not derailed by cyberattacks after Britain and the United States accused Russia of orchestrating efforts to disrupt the Games.Olympics organisers reported no significant impact on their operations for the 2020 Games, which were postponed until next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Britain and the United States on Monday condemned what they said were a series of malicious cyberattacks orchestrated by Russian military intelligence, including attempts to disrupt the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato declined to give details but said Japan would make every effort to protect the Games from possible hacking attempts."We cannot turn a blind eye to malicious cyberattacks that threaten democracy," Kato told a news conference, adding that Japan was gathering and analysing information and in close contact with Britain and the United States."The Olympics are a major international event that attract attention, and cybersecurity measures are extremely important."British officials said on Monday the hackers from Russia's GRU military intelligence agency had also conducted "cyber reconnaissance" operations against Tokyo Games organisers.They declined to give specific details about the latest attacks or say whether they were successful but said they had targeted Games organisers, logistics suppliers and sponsors.The organising committee said in a statement they had already made extensive cybersecurity preparations and that there had been little disruption to its platforms. "While we have constantly monitored various types of cyberattack on the digital platforms owned by Tokyo 2020, no significant impact has been observed in our operations," spokesman Masa Takaya said.Olympic sponsor Panasonic Corp said in a statement they were strengthening their global monitoring efforts, adding, "We did not detect any evidence of an attack."A representative for fellow sponsor Toyota Motor Corp declined to comment. A string of hacking attempts have been conducted against international sporting organisations which Western officials and cybersecurity experts say were orchestrated by Russia since its doping scandal erupted five years ago. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations.Russia was banned from the world's top sporting events for four years in December over widespread doping offences, including the Tokyo Games. An International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman said cybersecurity was one of their priorities. "The IOC and the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games have identified cyber security as a priority area and invest a lot to offer the Olympic Games the best cyber security environment possible," the spokesman told Reuters in an email."Given the nature of the topic, we do not divulge those measures."

Attorney General William Barr has urged his prosecutors to aggressively go after protesters who cause violence and has suggested that rarely used sedition charges could apply. But defense attorneys question why the Department of Justice has taken on some cases they say belong in state court, where defendants typically get much lighter sentences.
 “It is highly unusual, and without precedent in recent American history," said Ron Kuby, a longtime attorney who isn't involved the cases but has represented scores of clients over the years in protest-related incidents. “Almost all of the conduct that’s being charged is conduct that, when it occurs, is prosecuted at the state and local level.”
 In one case in Utah, where a police car was burned, federal prosecutors had to defend why they were bringing arson charges in federal court. They said it was appropriate because the patrol car was used in interstate commerce.
 Even though most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, Trump has made “law and order” a major part of his reelection campaign, casting the protests as lawless and violent in mostly Democratic cities he says have done nothing to stymie the mayhem. If the cities refuse to properly clamp down, he says, the federal government has to step in.
 “I know about antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are, and I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats,” Trump said at an NBC town hall.
 In dozens of cases, the government has pushed to keep the protesters behind bars while they await their trials amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 220,000 people across the U.S. There have been more than 16,000 positive cases in the federal prison system, according to a tracker compiled by the AP and The Marshall Project.
 In some cases, prosecutors have gone so far as appealing judge's orders to release defendants. Pre-trial detention generally is reserved only for people who are clearly dangers to the community or a risk of fleeing.
 In the Texas case, Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin repeatedly challenged the prosecutor to explain why Cyril Lartigue, who authorities say was caught on camera making a Molotov cocktail, should be behind bars while he awaits his trial. Lartigue, of Cedar Park, described his actions that night as a “flash of stupidity,” prosecutors said.
 The judge said there are lot of people “who do something stupid that’s dangerous that we don’t even consider detaining.”
 “I’m frustrated because I don’t think this is a hard case,” the judge said. “I have defendants in here with significant criminal histories that the government agrees to release."
 “We have no evidence of him — at least that's been given to me — being a radical or a member of a group that advocates violence toward the police or others. We've got no criminal history. … What evidence is there that he's a danger to society?” the judge asked.
 The judge allowed Lartigue to stay out of jail.
 While some of the defendants clearly hold radical or anti-government beliefs, prosecutors have provided little evidence of any affiliations they have with organized extremist groups.
 In one arrest in Erie, Pennsylvania, community members raised more than $2,500 to help with bail for a 29-year-old Black man who was arrested after they said white people had come and spray painted a parking lot.
 In thousands of pages of court documents, the only apparent mention of antifa is in a Boston case in which authorities said a FBI Gang Task Force member was investigating “suspected ANTIFA activity associated with the protests” when a man fired at him and other officers. Authorities have not claimed that the man accused of firing the shots is a member of antifa.
 Others have social media leftist ties; a Seattle man who expressed anarchist beliefs on social media is accused of sending a message through a Portland citizen communication portal threatening to blow up a police precinct.
 Several of the defendants are not from the Democratic-led cities that Trump has likened to “war zones" but from the suburbs the president has claimed to have “saved.” Of the 93 people arrested on federal criminal charges in Portland, 18 defendants are from out of state, the Justice Department said.
 This has contributed to a blame game that has been a subplot throughout the protests. Leaders in Minneapolis and Detroit have decried people from out of state and suburbanites for coming into their cities and causing havoc. Trump in turn has blamed the cities for not doing their part.
 “Don’t come down to Detroit and tear the city up and then go back home. That’s putting another knee on the neck of Black folk because we got to live here,” the Rev. Wendell Anthony of the NAACP said in May.
 More than 40% of those facing federal charges are white. More than two-thirds are under the age of 30, and most are men. More than a quarter have been charged with arson. More than a dozen are accused of civil disorder, and others are charged with burglary and failing to comply with a federal order. They were arrested in cities across the U.S., from Portland, Oregon, to Minneapolis, Boston and New York.
 Attorneys for those facing federal charges either declined to comment or didn’t respond to messages from the AP.
 Brian Bartels, a 20-year-old suburban Pittsburgh man who is described by prosecutors as a “self-identified left-wing anarchist," was flanked by his parents when he turned himself in to authorities. Bartels, who lives at his parents' house, spray painted an “A” on a police cruiser before jumping on top of it and smashing its windshield during a protest in the city, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty in September.
 One defendant who was arrested during a protest in the central Massachusetts city of Worcester told authorities he was “with the anarchist group.” Vincent Eovacious, 18, who is accused of possessing several Molotov cocktails, told authorities that he had been “waiting for an opportunity,” according to court documents.
 But tucked into the protest-related cases are accusations of far-right extremism and racism as well.
 John Malcolm Bareswill, angry that a local Black church held a prayer vigil for George Floyd, called the church and threatened to burn it to the ground, using racial slurs in a phone call overheard by children, prosecutors said. Bareswill, 63, of Virginia Beach, faces 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to making a telephonic threat.

All of the moving factors for Tech including the quarterback change, the injured receivers and a wavering offensive line are contributing to the inconsistencies in the offense, but the Red Raiders will look to iron out their issues and find a way to win their first conference match against West Virginia.
 On the opposite side of the ball, Tech is also struggling with consistency.
 They have shown their ability, though. For example, against the No. 1 offense in the Big 12, Texas, according to Big 12 sports, the Red Raiders at one point in the game held them to 38 total yards and just three points through five series of play.
 Considering the Longhorns lead the conference in scoring offense, passing yards and are second in total offense, the stops by the Red Raiders reflected their potential.
 Tech defensive coordinator Keith Patterson referenced the defensive spurts against the Longhorns in his news conference on Monday. He used it to point out the much-needed consistency his defense has to have moving forward.
 “We’ve been talking with our staff as well as our players; this is an important week for us to step up and take a big step defensively by playing consistently.” Patterson said.
 Against Iowa State, Tech’s defense spent 40 minutes of game time on the field through a combined 86 total passing and rushing plays, according to ESPN. Including special teams, the Red Raiders had 90 total tackles against the Cyclones.
 In sum, their defense was on the field a lot, and gave up 31 points at the end of regulation. On the positive side for Tech, as the game went on, their defense solidified. Out of four total touchdowns by the Cyclones, three of them were in the first half.
 Tech buckled down during the ladder portion of the game, and their play in the second half was in direct contrast to their first half play. Once again, showcasing their potential, but also their inconsistencies.
 Wells addressed one of the glaring errors in his defense, lining up. He said he wants the issues to be resolved moving forward.
 “A few (errors) is too many for us … We need to get in a great stance and then read our keys, and then we need to run to the football.” said Wells.
 The organization and readiness of the defense starts inherently, and chemistry has been a topic of discussion within the Red Raiders’ locker room.
 One of the vocal leaders for Tech, senior defensive back Eric Monroe, has seen growth from the team in regard to unity.
 “Coming together and playing for one another, having each other’s backs.” said Monroe regarding the team’s improvements. He also said the team has improved on doing their job and pulling their weight.
 Monroe and the rested Red Raider defense will look to slow down the Mountaineers at home on Saturday in hopes of earning their first conference win of the season.

A former top officer of Mumbai Police has filed a civil suit in a city court, seeking to restrain Republic TV, its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, and sister Hindi channel R Bharat from discussing the first information report (FIR) registered by the force in connection with an alleged television rating points (TRP) scam.
 (Read more: 'Issue summons to Arnab Goswami if he is proposed to be addressed as accused in TRP scam FIR, says Bombay HC)
 In his plea, Iqbal Shaikh, a former assistant commissioner of police (ACP), also accused the channel of causing him 'mental agony' on account of its 'defamatory reports' against the force, seeking damages to the tune of Rs 5 lakh. Shaikh also accused Republic TV and R Bharat of launching a 'smear campaign' against Mumbai Police, adding that the channels' allegations aggrieved him as he 'takes pride in his legacy in the illustrious police force of Mumbai.'
 News reports of the channels and the debates hosted by Arnab Goswami are done in complete violation of journalistic ethics, he has argued further in his plea. Shaikh, in his plea, has also taken objections to comments made by Goswami against Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.
 The case will be heard on Wednesday at 11am in courtroom number 4 in the city civil court.
   
   
 The controversy pertains to a press conference addressed by Singh on October 8, in which he accused Republic TV and two Marathi channels of 'manipulating' TRPs. An FIR was registered in connection with the alleged scam a day before the press conference, on October 7.
 The channel, however, has denied charges made against it and moved the Supreme Court, seeking quashing of the FIR, as well as the transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
 On October 15, hearing the channel's petition on October 15, the top court asked it to move Bombay high court instead.
 ARG Outlier Media, which owns Republic TV and R Bharat, has accused Mumbai Police and Singh of targeting the channels for their coverage of the Palghar lynching incident and the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.
 The high court, meanwhile, will begin the final hearing in the case from November 5. Six people have been arrested in connection with the case so far.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge was incredulous as a federal prosecutor pushed to keep a 25-year-old man behind bars until his trial on a charge of having a Molotov cocktail at a protest in May. The judge said he couldn't understand how the government could even argue that the man -- who had never previously been in trouble with the law, wasn't a member of violent groups and lived with his parents in a suburb outside Austin, Texas -- was too dangerous to be released.

UBS is giving lower-ranking employees an extra week's pay this year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and adding a financial softener for employees looking to exit finance, the world's largest wealth manager said on Tuesday.
 "As a sign of appreciation for their contribution throughout this challenging year, and acknowledging that the pandemic may have resulted in unexpected financial impact, the Group Executive Board has decided to award UBS's employees at less senior ranks with a one-time cash payment equivalent to one week's salary," the Swiss bank said in a statement announcing its third- quarter results, adding the measure would add roughly $30 million in expenses in the fourth quarter.
 The bank also said it had modified its bonus policy so that eligible employees who wanted to make a career change under the strains and uncertainty of COVID-19, would be able to retain more deferred compensation than previously.
 The new policy, instated in the third quarter, applied to voluntary leavers, excluding executives, it said.

Japan said on Tuesday it would take countermeasures to ensure next year's Tokyo Olympics are not derailed by cyberattacks after Britain and the United States accused Russia of orchestrating efforts to disrupt the Games.
 Olympics organisers reported no significant impact on their operations for the 2020 Games, which were postponed until next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Britain and the United States on Monday condemned what they said were a series of malicious cyberattacks orchestrated by Russian military intelligence, including attempts to disrupt the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
 Japanese chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato declined to give details but said Japan would make every effort to protect the Games from possible hacking attempts.
   
   
 "We cannot turn a blind eye to malicious cyberattacks that threaten democracy," Kato told a news conference, adding that Japan was gathering and analysing information and in close contact with Britain and the United States.
 "The Olympics are a major international event that attract attention, and cybersecurity measures are extremely important."
 British officials said on Monday the hackers from Russia's GRU military intelligence agency had also conducted "cyber reconnaissance" operations against Tokyo Games organisers.
 They declined to give specific details about the latest attacks or say whether they were successful but said they had targeted Games organisers, logistics suppliers and sponsors.
 The organising committee said in a statement they had already made extensive cybersecurity preparations and that there had been little disruption to its platforms.
 "While we have constantly monitored various types of cyberattack on the digital platforms owned by Tokyo 2020, no significant impact has been observed in our operations," spokesman Masa Takaya said.
 Olympic sponsor Panasonic Corp said in a statement they were strengthening their global monitoring efforts, adding, "We did not detect any evidence of an attack."
 A representative for fellow sponsor Toyota Motor Corp declined to comment.
 A string of hacking attempts have been conducted against international sporting organisations which Western officials and cybersecurity experts say were orchestrated by Russia since its doping scandal erupted five years ago.
 Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations.
 Russia was banned from the world's top sporting events for four years in December over widespread doping offences, including the Tokyo Games.
 An International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman said cybersecurity was one of their priorities.
 "The IOC and the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games have identified cyber security as a priority area and invest a lot to offer the Olympic Games the best cyber security environment possible," the spokesman told Reuters in an email.
 "Given the nature of the topic, we do not divulge those measures."

Attorney General William Barr has urged his prosecutors to aggressively go after protesters who cause violence and has suggested that rarely used sedition charges could apply. But defense attorneys question why the Department of Justice has taken on some cases they say belong in state court, where defendants typically get much lighter sentences.
 “It is highly unusual, and without precedent in recent American history," said Ron Kuby, a longtime attorney who isn't involved the cases but has represented scores of clients over the years in protest-related incidents. “Almost all of the conduct that’s being charged is conduct that, when it occurs, is prosecuted at the state and local level.”
 In one case in Utah, where a police car was burned, federal prosecutors had to defend why they were bringing arson charges in federal court. They said it was appropriate because the patrol car was used in interstate commerce.
 Even though most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, Trump has made “law and order” a major part of his reelection campaign, casting the protests as lawless and violent in mostly Democratic cities he says have done nothing to stymie the mayhem. If the cities refuse to properly clamp down, he says, the federal government has to step in.
 “I know about antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are, and I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats,” Trump said at an NBC town hall.
 In dozens of cases, the government has pushed to keep the protesters behind bars while they await their trials amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 220,000 people across the U.S. There have been more than 16,000 positive cases in the federal prison system, according to a tracker compiled by the AP and The Marshall Project.
 In some cases, prosecutors have gone so far as appealing judge's orders to release defendants. Pre-trial detention generally is reserved only for people who are clearly dangers to the community or a risk of fleeing.
 In the Texas case, Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin repeatedly challenged the prosecutor to explain why Cyril Lartigue, who authorities say was caught on camera making a Molotov cocktail, should be behind bars while he awaits his trial. Lartigue, of Cedar Park, described his actions that night as a “flash of stupidity,” prosecutors said.
 The judge said there are lot of people “who do something stupid that’s dangerous that we don’t even consider detaining.”
 “I’m frustrated because I don’t think this is a hard case,” the judge said. “I have defendants in here with significant criminal histories that the government agrees to release."
 “We have no evidence of him — at least that's been given to me — being a radical or a member of a group that advocates violence toward the police or others. We've got no criminal history. … What evidence is there that he's a danger to society?” the judge asked.
 The judge allowed Lartigue to stay out of jail.
 While some of the defendants clearly hold radical or anti-government beliefs, prosecutors have provided little evidence of any affiliations they have with organized extremist groups.
 In one arrest in Erie, Pennsylvania, community members raised more than $2,500 to help with bail for a 29-year-old Black man who was arrested after they said white people had come and spray painted a parking lot.
 In thousands of pages of court documents, the only apparent mention of antifa is in a Boston case in which authorities said a FBI Gang Task Force member was investigating “suspected ANTIFA activity associated with the protests” when a man fired at him and other officers. Authorities have not claimed that the man accused of firing the shots is a member of antifa.
 Others have social media leftist ties; a Seattle man who expressed anarchist beliefs on social media is accused of sending a message through a Portland citizen communication portal threatening to blow up a police precinct.
 Several of the defendants are not from the Democratic-led cities that Trump has likened to “war zones" but from the suburbs the president has claimed to have “saved.” Of the 93 people arrested on federal criminal charges in Portland, 18 defendants are from out of state, the Justice Department said.
 This has contributed to a blame game that has been a subplot throughout the protests. Leaders in Minneapolis and Detroit have decried people from out of state and suburbanites for coming into their cities and causing havoc. Trump in turn has blamed the cities for not doing their part.
 “Don’t come down to Detroit and tear the city up and then go back home. That’s putting another knee on the neck of Black folk because we got to live here,” the Rev. Wendell Anthony of the NAACP said in May.
 More than 40% of those facing federal charges are white. More than two-thirds are under the age of 30, and most are men. More than a quarter have been charged with arson. More than a dozen are accused of civil disorder, and others are charged with burglary and failing to comply with a federal order. They were arrested in cities across the U.S., from Portland, Oregon, to Minneapolis, Boston and New York.
 Attorneys for those facing federal charges either declined to comment or didn’t respond to messages from the AP.
 Brian Bartels, a 20-year-old suburban Pittsburgh man who is described by prosecutors as a “self-identified left-wing anarchist," was flanked by his parents when he turned himself in to authorities. Bartels, who lives at his parents' house, spray painted an “A” on a police cruiser before jumping on top of it and smashing its windshield during a protest in the city, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty in September.
 One defendant who was arrested during a protest in the central Massachusetts city of Worcester told authorities he was “with the anarchist group.” Vincent Eovacious, 18, who is accused of possessing several Molotov cocktails, told authorities that he had been “waiting for an opportunity,” according to court documents.
 But tucked into the protest-related cases are accusations of far-right extremism and racism as well.
 John Malcolm Bareswill, angry that a local Black church held a prayer vigil for George Floyd, called the church and threatened to burn it to the ground, using racial slurs in a phone call overheard by children, prosecutors said. Bareswill, 63, of Virginia Beach, faces 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to making a telephonic threat.

 “People have been coming in and congratulating me for opening and it has been really hard having to turn them away.
 “Someone came in the other day saying it’s only restaurants and pubs which are shut and he was being quite harsh to me. I had to explain I wasn’t open until a few weeks ago and had been advised to just stick to takeaway for now.
