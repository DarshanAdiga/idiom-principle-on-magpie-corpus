His ball over the top for Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 10th minute was one that impressed the commentary team, but to the old gold faithful, it is one seen on a weekly basis.
 One thing that will have come as a surprise to Wolves fans was the fact Coady went forward for an England corner. Something beyond rare when he is at club level.
 Although England’s first half was far from impressive as a whole, on an individual level he looked assured throughout, completing switches with ease.
 Defensively, Coady looked assured for much of the evening, with the hosts reluctant to throw bodies forward in the final 30 minutes.
 In truth, the second half was effectively a non-event for the England defenders, but when called upon Coady’s trusty distrubution didn’t let him down.
 A debut and a clean sheet. From his perspective, a job well done.

As evening fell, police dispersed several hundred demonstrators rallying in Minsk in solidarity with Kolesnikova and detained at least 45 protesters, according to the Viasna human rights center.
 U.N. Secretary‑General Antonio Guterres expressed "very serious concern" at "the repeated use of force against peaceful protesters, as well as reported pressures on opposition civil society activists," U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
 The U.N. chief's message is that "the Belarusian people should be able to exercise their political and constitutional rights peacefully in a democratic environment," the spokesman said, and "the current crisis that we're seeing in Belarus needs to be resolved through an inclusive dialogue amongst the Belarusian people."
 After a brutal crackdown on protesters by police in the initial days after the vote that stoked international outrage and swelled the ranks of protesters, authorities in Belarus have switched to threats and selective arrests of activists and demonstrators.
 Belarusian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into members of the Coordination Council, accusing them of undermining national security by calling for a transition of power. Several council members were arrested and others were called for questioning.
 Last week, Pavel Latushko, a former minister of culture and ambassador to France who joined the opposition council, traveled to Poland after facing threats and being questioned. His departure came a day after Lukashenko warned that Latushko had crossed a "red line" and would face prosecution.
 On Saturday, Tsikhanouskaya associate Olga Kovalkova also moved to Poland after the authorities threatened to jail her for a long time if she refused to leave the country.
 Kovalkova said agents of the Belarusian State Security Committee, or KGB, put her into a car, where she was told to lie on the floor, unaware where they were taking her. She was dropped off in no-man's land between the Belarus and Poland border, and Polish border guards asked a bus driver headed for Poland to take her on board.
 The French Foreign Ministry issued a strong condemnation "of arbitrary arrests and the practice of forced exiles of several members of the Coordination Council, as well as of numerous demonstrators in recent days."
 "We call on Belarus authorities to end without delay these actions, to free those arbitrarily detained," and open a national dialogue, the ministry said.
 Despite the pressure on opposition activists, daily protests have continued and crowds have swelled on the weekends. An estimated 100,000 attended a rally Sunday, despite heavy rain.
 Speaking in an interview with Russian journalists, Lukashenko said it's "tragic" for him to face massive protests, but insisted that he has retained the support of most of the country.
 "I must protect what has been built with our hands, protect the people who have built it, and they are an overwhelming majority," he said.
 Amid Western criticism, Lukashenko has relied on support from Moscow, his main sponsor and ally. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he stands ready to send police to Belarus on Lukashenko's request if rallies turn violent but there is no need for that yet.
 Lukashenko blamed the U.S. for instigating the protests and warned Russia that it could face similar demonstrations in the future.
 "If Belarus collapses today, Russia will come next," he said.
 Observers say Lukashenko hopes to stem the protests with selective repressions against the opposition leaders and soothe public anger with vague talk about constitutional reform and a new election at an unspecified date. The Kremlin has endorsed his promise of such a reform.
 "The authorities' scenario is clear — push all the leaders out of the country and step up repressions against demonstrators while imitating a dialogue on a constitutional reform under the patronage of the Kremlin," said Valery Karbalevich, an independent Minsk-based analyst. "Lukashenko hopes that the rallies of 100,000 will fizzle after the expulsion of opposition leaders, but so far it has had an opposite effect, helping fuel more protests."

Asian shares declined on Wednesday after a sell-off of big technology stocks on Wall Street pulled U.S. benchmarks lower. Crude oil prices and Treasury yields also weakened. Australia’s benchmark led regional declines on Wednesday, losing more than 2%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.6%. Troubles with Astra-Zeneca’s coronavirus vaccine trial and simmering China-U.S. tensions also have rattled investors. “At a minimum, the optimism balloon floated by vaccine hopes has sprung a sizable leak,\" Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. said in a commentary. Talk by President Donald Trump of “decoupling” the U.S. economy from China, as the presidential campaign heats up has ramped up uncertainty as Washington seeks to limit use of U.S. technology by Chinese companies, citing national security concerns. The relationship between the world’s two largest economies has been on edge for years, and the antagonism threatens to further undermine global growth at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has pushed many countries into recession. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.6% to 22,904.31 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1% to 24,390.21. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 tumbled 2.3% to 5,872.10 and the Shanghai Composite index shed 1.4% to 3,271.79. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.7% to 2,834.59.

Two other council members who crossed into Ukraine, Ivan Kravtsov and Anton Rodnenkov, described Kolesnikova's action with open admiration.
 "She was shouting that she won't go anywhere," Rodnenkov said at a news conference in Kyiv. "Sitting in the car, she saw her passport on a front seat and tore it into many small fragments, crumpled them and threw them out of the window. After that, she opened the back door and walked back to the Belarusian border."
 He said that "Maria is in great shape, full of energy and spirits, as always."
 Anton Bychkovsky, spokesman for Belarus' Border Guard Committee, confirmed she is in the custody of Belarusian authorities but refused to give any details of what happened on the border.
 Belarus has used similar tactics to force other opposition figures to leave the country, seeking to end a month of demonstrations that followed the reelection of Lukashenko in a vote that protesters see as rigged. Lukashenko has ruled the country for 26 years, relentlessly stifling dissent and keeping most of the economy in state hands.
 The 66-year-old former state farm director has rejected criticism from the United States and the European Union, which said the Aug. 9 election was neither free nor fair and shrugged off their demands to open a dialogue with the opposition.
 In Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement state the U.S. and its allies are considering additional sanctions targeted at Belarus, and he expressed concern about the attempt expulsion of Kalesnikava.
 "We commend the courage of Ms. Kalesnikava and of the Belarusian people in peacefully asserting their right to pick their leaders in free and fair elections in the face of unjustified violence and repression by the Belarusian authorities, which included brazen beatings of peaceful marchers in broad daylight and hundreds of detentions September 6, as well as increasing reports of abductions," Pompeo said.
 Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger to Lukashenko, left for Lithuania a day after the election under pressure from authorities.
 Addressing the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on Tuesday, Tsikhanuskaya called for international sanctions against Lukashenko and other government officials.
 "We need international pressure on this regime, on this one individual, desperately clinging onto power," she said.
 Tsikhanouskaya stated that Lukashenko doesn't have any legitimacy after stealing the vote, warning other countries against deals with the Belarusian government.
 "He does not represent Belarus anymore," she said.
 In separate comments about the attempt to expel Kolesnikova, Tsikhanouskaya praised her as a "real hero," and said that "such actions are incapable of breaking the will of the people or their desire to change their country's future."
 Kolesnikova, a 38-year-old flute player who led a popular arts center, entered politics just before the election. She led the campaign headquarters of a top potential challenger to Lukashenko, and when he was barred from running and jailed on charges widely seen as political, she joined Tsikhanouskaya's campaign.
 Another associate of Tsikhanouskaya, Antonina Konovalova, disappeared Tuesday after a court fined her for taking part in a weekend protest.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pinch-hitter Darin Ruf homered with one out in the seventh inning and the San Francisco Giants beat Seattle 6-5 on Tuesday night, ending the Mariners’ six-game winning streak. Alex Dickerson and Mauricio Dubón also went deep for the Giants, who erased a 5-1 deficit to win for the seventh time in nine games. First-year San Francisco manager Gabe Kapler had to use five pitchers to keep his club on a roll and got another big night from the offense. Donovan Solano had three hits and scored twice. Brandon Belt singled twice and had two RBIs. The Giants have scored four or more runs in 10 consecutive games for the first time since 2007. “We have guys that can hit the ball out of this ballpark, out of other ballparks,” Kapler said. “One of the things that we continue to say and that we’ve seen play out is that we’re not out of games so we can handle an early deficit and trust that we have the guys who can hit singles but also hit balls in the gaps and sometimes in the seats.” J.P. Crawford drove in three for the Mariners. Ruf’s blast off lefty reliever Anthony Misiewicz (0–2) was his third of the season and the fourth of his career as a pinch-hitter. Ruf, in his first year back in the majors after playing three seasons in Korea, was called on to hit for Dickerson, who homered off right-hander Brady Lail in the third. “It’s a lot of fun mainly because most of the time it’s not going to work out that way where you’re going to get a home run from the left side and then Ruf’s going to come in and pinch hit and hit a big home run,” Kapler said. “That just doesn’t happen that frequently, so when it does work out in your favor you remember how often it goes the other way.” Dickerson, who was questionable before the game...

Rebel MP and new president in South Australia's upper house John Dawkins has cast himself as an independent in the role after moves to have him expelled from the Liberal parliamentary party.
 Mr Dawkins won the plum job in bizarre circumstances on Tuesday after two votes left him tied with fellow Liberal and the government's nominee Jing Lee.
 The upper house veteran prevailed when his name was then drawn first out of the ballot box, which then prompted Liberal MPs to vote to boot him from the parliamentary party.
 Moves were also made to have the Liberal Party executive expel him as a member.
 Treasurer Rob Lucas said Mr Dawkins' actions were unacceptable.
 "He understood the consequences of his decision. He's made his bed, he'll need to lay in it now."
 But Mr Dawkins, who intends to retire at the next state election in 2022, has written to party officials indicating it matters little.
 He told them that as the new Legislative Council president he did not intend to attend party room meetings anyway.
 "I have always sought to uphold our parliament's strong standing as a democratic institution and the cornerstone of accountable, transparent government in our state," he said in a statement.
 "These are core Liberal values and, as precedent provides, yesterday I exercised the long-enshrined right of Liberal MPs to act according to their individual principles, even if independent of the party's position on the day."
 Mr Dawkins said he still looked forward to working effectively with all his parliamentary colleagues.
 Two votes were also needed on Tuesday to elect first-term lower house MP Josh Teague as the new speaker in the House of Assembly.
 Mr Teague was challenged by former Labor and now independent MP Frances Bedford, and the pair initially tied on 23 votes each, with one informal vote, in the first count on Tuesday.
 The initial result came despite the government having a clear majority in the lower house.
 In the second ballot, Mr Teague won 25-22.
 The speaker's position had become available when Premier Steven Marshall reshuffled his cabinet after losing two ministers because of the parliamentary allowances scandal.
 Tim Whetstone and Stephan Knoll, who both represent country electorates, resigned their ministerial roles when it was revealed they had wrongly made claims for staying in Adelaide on parliamentary business.
 That prompted Mr Marshall to elevate the previous speaker, Vincent Tarzia, to a cabinet post.

Some companies with leases that are ending this year or next appear to be kicking the can down the road, signing short-term extensions rather than committing to typical deals that last several years. In recent weeks, NBC Universal extended a lease for a secondary office at 1221 Avenue of the Americas and the Stroock &amp;amp; Stroock &amp;amp; Lavan law firm did the same for its office downtown. But they both did so for just a year, according to Colliers. A spokeswoman for NBC Universal declined to comment and Stroock &amp;amp; Stroock did not return a call and multiple emails.

The coronavirus pandemic may have upped the ante with the security challenges posed by a rapid move to remote learning, but the education sector has been something of a powder keg for a very long time. Education institutions hold masses of highly sensitive data on individuals, perhaps more so than any industry outside healthcare. Along with personal information such as name, address, DOB, there's also the potential to hold payment details, ID, health records, and much more. This trove of information puts a target on the back of every good-sized school, college, or university. Also, like medical institutions, education centers must maintain short- and long-term continuity. Canceling exams, writing off grades, and cutting off services is not an option, and cybercriminals know this, which also makes the sector one of the most targeted by ransomware attacks. This incident at Newcastle University is just the latest of many in a sector increasingly under attack. And the only defense is one that places the very people under attack at its heart.

Rural and northern Arizona have been hit hard by COVID-19. Businesses have suffered under prolonged closures. A recent study on the fiscal impact to college towns identified Flagstaff as one of 11 small college towns likely to feel the brunt of the pandemic.
 Children continue to be away from the classroom, making learning a challenge and increasing the burden on working parents.
 Will rural and northern Arizona bounce back? Or be left behind? That depends in large part on the decisions we make this November.
 There will be four candidates for state House on your November ballot. You will have the opportunity to choose two.
 I’m a fifth generation Arizonan. As I like to say, my roots and boots are firmly planted in the rich red soil of Arizona. I have experience in both the private and public sector, which is necessary for a someone representing the interests of a diverse group of citizens. As a representative of this district from 2010-2018 and chair of the House Committee for Agriculture and Water, I had to frequently address the nitty gritty issues that affect farmers, growers, and the management of natural resources we all share. I led on legislation to ensure Arizonans in rural areas have access to safe drinking water. I also fought to end federal control of Arizona’s public lands. These decisions don’t necessarily make the alluring soundbites that capture attention, but they are the decisions that keep rural and northern Arizona running. I’ve always believed in being a workhorse — not a showhorse.
 For our district to bounce back, we’ll need to make smart fiscal decisions, relieve the regulatory burden on small businesses, keep taxes low, get creative about making health care more accessible and affordable, and expand education opportunities. Walt Blackman and I have shown that these are the policies we’ll be fighting for. But what about our opponents?
 Coral Evans’ time as a Flagstaff councilwoman and mayor have been marked by irresponsible decisions. Evans voted to raise property taxes three consecutive years (2017, 2018, and 2019), and supported local trash and stormwater utility fee increases impacting residents. When Flagstaff was thriving financially, she chose to fund “sustainability” and climate change instead of paying on the city’s public safety pension liability (for firefighters and police), which ballooned $27 million over five years. The result? After kicking the can down the road and making various attempts to raise the funds — from considering a ballot initiative to increase sales tax to mortgaging city assets — Flagstaff still owes $111 million. City Manager Greg Clifton expressed concern in February, saying the unfunded pension will “greatly constrain us on doing other things.” At a time when Flagstaff should be focused on its economy, job growth, and affordable housing, taxpayers face the continuing repercussions of Evans’ irresponsible leadership.
 What about “independent” Art Babbott? Arizona voters should look past his “bipartisan” rhetoric. While he may pretend not to know who he’d side with if elected, his partisan leanings have been clear for some time. He is a decorated donor to the local Democratic Party and his support for Bernie Sanders is well-documented (he endorsed him for president in 2016 and introduced him at a rally that same year). It’s pretty obvious that the policies of Bernie Sanders and progressive Democrats are out of touch with the needs of rural and northern Arizona. Voters can expect Babbott to toe the Democratic policy-line right along with Evans if elected.
 If we want our district to bounce back, we need proven leadership. When you vote, look beyond rhetoric to records. The choice will be clear.

I went to school with Dean Takko. He is, and always will be, my dear friend. He's always served the 19th Legislative District faithfully and honestly, but it's time for new blood in the Washington State Senate.
 If you're a patriot, love our country and are what America stands for, and detest the socialist "cancel culture" thinking being spread in our schools today, I urge you to vote for Jeff Wilson for the 19th District on Nov. 4.
 Wilson is a red, white and blue patriot who believes in democracy, freedom as our forefathers laid it out in the Constitution and in the American way of life. He supports law and order, our rights to bear arms and teaching our children the real and true history of our state and country, not the revisionist socialism that's at the root of the anarchy and violence happening in Portland, Seattle and other democratically run American cities. It's time to root out this way of thinking.

Miejsca pracy w górnictwie, które pozostały stosunkowo stabilne przez pierwsze trzy lata urzędowania Trumpa, spadły po wybuchu pandemii o około 18 tys. – do 64 tys. w drugim kwartale tego roku. W czasie kampanii w 2016 roku Hillary Clinton zapowiadała, że „zamierza wykluczyć z biznesu wielu górników i firmy węglowe”. Później próbowała wycofać te komentarze. Jak komentuje to Michael McKenna, strateg energetyczny GOP i były urzędnik Białego Domu, „Górnicy węglowi są amerykańskim archetypem i broniąc ich, Trump bronił amerykańskiego archetypu”. Jednak obietnica Trumpa, że ponownie otworzy kopalnie i przywróci górników do pracy, była od początku skazana na porażkę. „To faza końcowa przemysłu węglowego” – tłumaczy Kevin Book, dyrektor zarządzający ClearView Energy Partners, firmy badawczej.

Few designers, present or past, elicit the awe and level of rapture among fans and critics alike as McQueen, Zuiker included. She loves the more esoteric pieces in her collection and is quick to reference shows, from "Horn of Plenty" to "Sarabande." (The latter holds a special place in her heart because of “the big hat that Philip created”). Her initial interest, however, came from a more pragmatic place. “The tailoring is just spot on,” Zuiker says of McQueen’s rtw. “It was perfection. Where he would dart a dress…I’m a short girl with curves and it would fit me, which is shocking.…The fact that he would understand where your curve would be and he fit to a normal woman. The show pieces, obviously, are made for a model but then any of the ready-to-wear fits.”

"Free", the last song ever penned by the original line-up of Big Audio Dynamite, was commissioned for the soundtrack to the 1990 action-comedy caper Flashback starring Dennis Hopper and Kiefer Sutherland. The song was issued as a US-only promo single in the hope that the resulting cinema exposure would see the track take off in the clubs. When this sadly didn't happen, Jones gave the song a makeover and it reappeared as the track 'Kickin' In' on BAD II's debut album, Kool-Aid.

"The company's pharma revenue was affected due to production suspension at Nanjangud API plant while Radiopharma and Allergy business saw an interim decline in revenues due to postponement of elective procedures amid COVID-19 related restrictions on hospital/physician visits. The decline in Radiopharma was steeper than expected. Also, being a high-margin business, the decline in net earnings was much steeper. LSI revenue was affected by lower demand and prices of commodity chemicals (ethyl acetate and acetic anhydride), which was offset by better prices for the nutritional portfolio," analysts at Nirmal Bang Equities said in results update.
