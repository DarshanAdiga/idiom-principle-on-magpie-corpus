The house has a frosted white front wall, with the notable Gruene Hall logo in black. It even has a gray water tower, with white frosting snow dripping down the sides and a green candy light.
 A green Lifesaver and hard red candies create a Christmas wreath on the hall’s front. Little Reeses cups with chocolate M&Ms make the potted plants that decorate the side of the building.
 The sweet structure has a sugar-dusted gingerbread roof with slats and black frosting windows. Spina said it was tricky getting the proportions right.
 “I have to work with a template and guesstimate some things,” Spina laughed. “Others can measure as long as you have a nice flat image. I used an X-Acto knife and gingerbread and cut it. There’s lots of frosting on it on the front and back.”
 Marcy Morgan was roommates with Spina from around 2008 to 2009. Morgan said Spina would make gingerbread houses every Christmas as a tradition.
 Spina would let Morgan and her other roommates decorate the houses, too.
 “She always makes them from scratch so she makes her own gingerbread,” Morgan said. “She would be baking out the sheets, sometimes I would see her have like a sketch of what she was going to do. She knew what she was going to cut out and she would put them together.”
 As a longtime New Braunfels resident, Morgan said it was natural for Spina to make a Gruene Hall house.
 “That’s totally her and I’m surprised she hasn’t done it sooner because she’s been living in New Braunfels and she loves it,” Morgan said.
 Sometimes the pieces would not fit perfectly, but she found ways around it, Morgan said.
 “She would find out that piece didn’t work out like she thought,” Morgan said. “I think she finally got to the process of making extra and we would just chow down on them if she didn’t need them or she would make them into something else.”

The Yazidis, traumatized by the mass killing and enslavement that IS unleashed against them, have no trust in the Iraqi authorities they say abandoned them to the militants’ brutality. With the central government weak, they fear militias — including Iranian-backed Shiite factions — will gain sway over them.
 The militias policing Sinjar the past three years are a mix. They include peshmerga fighters from Iraq’s Kurdish autonomy zone, as well as the PKK and its affiliate made up of local Yazidi fighters, called the Sinjar Resistance Units or YBS. There are also Yazidi units belonging to the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of state-sanctioned paramilitaries created in 2014 to defeat IS.
 There are signs of recovery of Sinjar. Its city center hummed with shoppers, merchants — and the odd Iraqi army tank. More of the 200,000 Yazidis displaced by the 2014 IS onslaught are coming back — some 21,600 returning between June to September, many times the rate of previous years.
 But scratch the surface, and almost everyone harbors raw, unresolved trauma. Everyone vividly recalls the IS attack that murdered fathers and sons, enslaved thousands of women and sent survivors fleeing up Sinjar mountain.
 In Sinjar’s market, a farmer, Zaidan Khalaf, introduced himself first by telling The Associated Press how many relatives he lost under IS: 18. Others in the market did the same.
 “We lost our dignity,” he said.
 Communities remain deeply divided and bitterly resentful of one another.
 “What agreement?” scoffed Farzo Mato Sabo, an 86-year-old in the predominantly Yazidi village of Tal Binat, south of Sinjar. She and her three daughters were taken by IS militants and later saved by smugglers. Eleven of her family members are still unaccounted for.

William Pearson became sick a few days after a co-worker tested positive for the coronavirus, so he went to a local CVS Pharmacy for a test.
 Ten days passed, and he still hadn’t received results, which made him suspicious.
 Pearson, 43, said he called the CVS MinuteClinic on Monday and demanded an answer. A staffer provided him with a letter Wednesday saying the lab lost specimens collected Dec. 11 and 12, including his.
 Pearson said he is irked not so much by test results being lost, but by CVS failing to inform him of the mishap so he could be tested elsewhere rather than using a week and a half of vacation time to quarantine while he waited for the results.
 “Them losing the samples — it happens — but them not telling people about it? It’s inexcusable,” Pearson said.
 He said it’s even more galling because the letter indicates the company knew about the lost test results all along.
 The letter, which Pearson shared with _The New Mexican,_ acknowledges the lost specimens, offers an apology and claims CVS tried to notify Pearson, a software engineer who lives in Santa Fe.
 “We have attempted to reach you by phone to inform you,” the letter states. “However, we received your voicemail or was unable to reach you at the number you provided.”
 The letter goes on to say Pearson must phone to reschedule a swab; if not, he’ll receive a refund.

YBS fighters interviewed said they expected to be subsumed as a unit of the Popular Mobilization Forces, providing them with much-needed political legitimacy. A portion of the 2,500-3,500 YBS fighters are already on the PMF payroll.
 In theory, the plan calls for the PMF to end its presence in the city as well. To date, they are supporting forces and securing Sinjar's peripheries. But Khan Ali, the commander of the Laslish Brigades, a Yazidi unit of the group, told the AP, “The (PMF) will stay forever, we are kings over the heads of the security forces in Sinjar.”
 That prospect has divided Yazidis. Some want Yazidi PMF factions included in the security arrangement. Others fear it will bring Sinjar under the influence of the Shiite Arab factions close to Iran that dominate the umbrella group.
 “If the international community and central government don’t care about Sinjar, the PMF will take control,” one prominent Yazidi leader said, requesting anonymity to speak freely. “This is clear.”

Michael Porter Jr. scored 24 points for Denver despite early foul trouble, but playoff star Jamal Murray was held to five points and was 1-for-9 shooting before fouling out late in regulation.
 “I’d be lying if I told you our defense had a lot to do with that,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “When you’re as good as Jamal Murray and you have a shooting night like that, that’s more him having an off-night. Now, I give our guys credit for competing and making it hard for him. But he sees that every night.
 “I actually feel bad for whoever has to guard him next time out. I’m assuming he’ll probably have a pretty good game. But our guys did a heck of a job competing.”
 Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was asked if Murray could match his playoff prowess in the new season, and he used the opportunity to talk about how the team’s first trip to the Western Conference Finals in a decade last summer was already old news.
 “As great as last season was -- I’m going to keep saying this -- that season is over,” Malone said. “That was a different team. Yes, we have our core back, but we have seven new players. As great as it was to win our division, to get to the Western Conference Finals, to comeback from two 3-1 deficits; starting tonight, who cares? That’s over.”
 Murray emerged as a bona fide star in the bubbled playoffs in Florida, but Malone said Murray, Jokic and everyone else has to forget about that run now.
