Sub acest semn joi, 7 mai 2020, am abordat cu Sandra Alexiu şi problemele medicilor de familie, una dintre cele mai importante fiind absenţa digitalizării din Sistem.

But at the same time, it’s curious that this same trend can’t be said to be taking place in the podcast industry. Certainly self-help podcasts exist, but not with the popularity of audiobooks. Again, it’s possible this comes down to the public perception of the genre. Being published lends them an air of authority that podcasts don’t necessarily have, which audiobook producers are careful to cultivate. For example, when choosing the narrator Cobb says, “a narrator can make or break an audiobook.” The publisher decides if the author of the book or a professional narrator voices the recording. Unlike a lifestyle or health podcast, Cobb says very different skills are needed to narrate an audiobook. One must modulate their voice and meet the expectations of the reader in order for the book to come to life, whereas podcasts are much more conversational.

A senior US official, who was not authorised to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "There has been no offer and no offer of direct talks." Rabiei said Iran considers the US government responsible for the health of the Iranian prisoners, adding that "it seems that the US has more readiness to bring the situation to an end." Rabiei did not elaborate, but Iranian media in recent months said there are several Iranians in US custody, including Sirous Asgari, a 60-year-old university professor. Last week, US officials said they were making progress in efforts to secure the release of a detained Navy veteran in Iran. But they were also pushing back on Iranian suggestions that a swap was in the works for the imprisoned Iranian professor. US officials have been trying to deport Asgari since last year.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia's government on Sunday condemned what it called the “inhuman” treatment of its nationals by a Chinese fishing company that allegedly kept Indonesian fishermen as virtual slaves, leading to the deaths of at least three of them.
 Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a video conference from the capital, Jakarta, that 49 Indonesian fishermen, ranging from 19 to 24 years old, were forced to work an average of over 18 hours a day on at least four Chinese fishing boats.
 Marsudi said some of the fishermen were either not paid at all or did not receive the amount they had agreed to. The tireless work and poor conditions on the ship caused illnesses among the crew members, killing at least three Indonesians, whose bodies were cast overboard into the Pacific Ocean, she said.
 “We condemn the inhuman treatment against our crew members working at the Chinese fishing company,” Marsudi said. “Based on the information from the crews, the company has violated human rights.”
 Marsudi said almost all of the fishermen were repatriated to Indonesia from four Chinese fishing vessels after undergoing a mandatory coronavirus quarantine at a hotel in the South Korean city of Busan, where their boats were docked after 13 months at sea.
 The move came after videos released by local media in South Korea drew a public outcry.

 Unfortunately, every pet was not able to be moved to a teacher’s home. But Scott Doty, who teaches biology at Berkley High School, is still taking care of his classroom animals.
 Doty has about 30 aquariums in his classroom holding about 300 fish. He couldn’t move them, so he goes to the school to feed them. There is also a bearded dragon, a ball python, a tarantula and a colony of Madagascar hissing cockroaches.
 Kefgen was one of many at his school awarded a grant from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to raise salmon. The fish were supposed to live in the school aquarium until they could be released into the wild on Mother’s Day weekend.
 But those plans changed when the shutdown happened. The fish had to be released in March into cold water that reduces their chance to survive, Kefgen said.
 “In terms of classroom pets, that was, I think, the most heartbreaking,” Kefgen said. “We had to do an emergency salmon release without the kids.”

Similarly, the premature attack by the Prussian Guard Korps at St Privat bears witness to the destructive effects of modern firepower; 8000 men were killed or wounded, mostly in the space of 20 minutes. A small indication of the extraordinary dedication of France’s better troops is also provided by the losses they endured. One regiment that entered the battle at Froeschwiller 2300-strong emerged with just three officers and 250 men. In the same engagement, the 3rd Zouaves lost 45 out of their 66 officers and 1775 out of 2200 rank and file. That they continued resisting to such extreme lengths suggests that their morale was all that had been claimed on the eve of hostilities. Certainly, the war was not lost for lack of courage. Indeed, the French infantry generally lived up to their reputation for resilience and aggressive spirit, not least at Borny, where their savage, dashing counter- attacks confirmed the Germans’ evaluations of their tactical prowess.

Unii vor spune că aşa trebuia să fie. Dacă ne gîndim însă bine, transformarea spitalelor obişnuite în spitale aşteptînd inutil bolnavii de Coronavirus a costat statul român şi mai ales pacienţii români. În cele două luni de luptă cu Pandemia, dacă aveai ghinionul să faci un infarct nu te lua nimeni în seamă.

Caity McArthur, a North Carolinian who had a baby boy last month, said it has been "a very scary time to be giving birth." She had a Caesarean-section delivery at her hospital, fearful all the while for her asthmatic husband facing greater risk from COVID-19.
 Hospitals across the country have seen a sharp decline in patients coming in with heart attack, stroke, cardiac arrest - even appendicitis - out of fears about COVID-19. Recently, the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and several other medical groups issued a joint statement urging those experiencing symptoms of such threatening conditions to call 911 and go straightaway to the hospital.
 So how do we balance the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a health facility against the risk of not seeking care? Several moms told me they hover over stir-crazy kids' risky behaviors to reduce the chance of needing an ER, but children (and even adults) break bones and can get sick. How do we stay safe when it's necessary to get care?
 "Hospitals and clinics are reducing the on-site transmission risk by limiting or restricting visitors, postponing elective procedures, screening staff for illness before they start their shifts and accelerating the use of telehealth," Amy Williams, a physician and executive dean for practice at Mayo Clinic, said in an email.
 The CDC issued COVID-19 care guidelines, which specify ideal infection control procedures, but Williams acknowledges "resource constraints are making it nearly impossible to meet guidelines." It doesn't mean hospitals aren't providing good care, she says. It means, "they are providing the best care they can in extremely difficult circumstances."
 That puts some of the burden back on us, the patients, to stay safe and be proactive. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, suggests following the new normal precautions.

Whereas this effectively created safe havens for the enemy, at Froeschwiller, MacMahon allowed the German infantry to get too close to his own guns. Clinging to the French Army’s traditional practice, he kept much of his artillery in reserve, intending to commit it at the climactic moment. His timing and coup d’oeil failed him, however, and his gunners were driven back by a hail of rifle-fire. Attempts by both sides to use cavalry for shock- action were similarly flawed. For example, at Froeschwiller, the nine squadrons of General Michel’s cuirassier brigade were virtually wiped out executing charges that were as futile as they were courageous, while, at Sedan, General Margueritte’s squadrons met the same fate. Although the Prussian king himself was moved to remark on the bravery of the latter group of horsemen, it is improbable that they came within a sword’s length of a single enemy soldier, so intense was the fire directed against them. Even the success of Bredow’s charge at Vionville – which, perfectly timed and carefully screened, managed to catch Canrobert’s batteries on the hop, throwing them into chaos at a critical moment – was only gained at the cost of 50 per cent casualties among the attacking cavalry.

On Monday, France will start to gradually release the lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has caused over 26,000 confirmed deaths and infected some 140,000 people.
 As Robert Ejnes, executive director of the Conseil Representatif des Institutions Juives de France (CRIF), explained to The Jerusalem Post, Jewish institutions are also working to prepare the exit strategy for synagogues, schools and all the facilities that represent the pillar of the Jewish life in the country, amid worries related to a documented rise in antisemitism connected to the emergency and the expected economic crisis.
 "After the beginning of the pandemic, we created a crisis management unit to respond to the needs of the community, including offering psychological support and assisting the sick and the bereaved families," Ejnes explained.
 Together with the CRIF, the task force includes representatives of institutions such as the Unified Jewish Social Fund (FSJU), the Children Aid Society (OSE), the Casip-Cojasor Foundation for social action and the Israelite Central Consistory of France.
 About 500,000 Jews live in France in a population of 67 million people. Since no data based on religious affiliation is collected, it is difficult to know how many Jews have been infected or have succumbed to the coronavirus. Estimations published by the Israeli paper Makor Rishon varied between several hundreds to 2,000.
 Ejnes pointed out that unfortunately, the CRIF special team working on monitoring antisemitism in France has been registering an increase of antisemitic discourse on the internet.
 "We see a lot of conspiracy theories against Jews, especially on social media," he told the Post.
 At the end of April, the CRIF addressed a letter to the head of Zoom France denouncing episodes of "zoombombing."
 The task force is now working on developing protocols under the government guidelines for synagogues and schools to reopen. The CRIF CEO said he does not believe that they will be able to resume activities before the end of May and only in a limited framework.
 "Even if in-person events cannot take place, most synagogues and institutions are more active than ever, holding a lot of online activities," he pointed out.
 "What we are very worried about is the economic crisis that is going to follow the health crisis. We expect that a lot more people are going to need the help of Jewish institutions. For this reason, Jewish organizations are working on increasing their fundraising," he explained.
 If Jewish institutions are gearing up for difficult times, Faustine Sigal, a 26-year-old Parisian Jew who works as international director of Jewish Education at Jewish nonprofit Moishe House, said that she and her friends are not too worried about losing jobs at the moment.
 "The laws protecting workers in France are very strong. Since the beginning of the crisis, the government assured that nobody would lose their job because of the virus. So far, I only know one person who was working as a freelancer and whose contract that expired was not renewed," she told the Post.
 Sigal explained that after the outbreak she is seeing a lot of young people volunteering, starting from the residents of the three Moishe Houses in Paris. The nonprofit subsidizes part of the rent of apartments whose residents - generally three to five - commit to organize events for the community and open their doors. Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, all the activities have switched to online.
 Sigal also shared some criticism towards the Jewish institutions in the country.
 "I know that there are people who have continued to gather to pray in a quorum during the lockdown even if it is prohibited and I haven't seen any reaction from the Consistory or other institutions," she said. "Moreover, in many communities around the world I heard very interesting conversations about issues such as using Zoom in order to reunite families for the Passover Seder. My feeling is that in France the question was just ignored."
 Sigal did have a Seder on Zoom to connect with her parents. Her father was infected with the virus and hospitalized right before Passover. He has since recovered.
 "I think for a lot of young people this was the first time that they had to figure out how to prepare and run a Seder by themselves and not just rely on their families. For many it was a learning experience," she pointed out.
 Another area where the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the French Jewish community is the ability to travel to Israel where many have family.
 "My last living grandparent was living in Israel and passed away right at the beginning of the crisis. We were not able to go for the burial and the mourning period, which was pretty traumatic," Sigal shared.
 "I have six children in Israel, not being able to see them is not easy," said Ejnes.
 As it is happening all over the world, also ceremonies such as weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs had to be postponed.
 "I was invited to nine weddings this summer, all of them have been canceled for the time being," Sigal told the Post.
 "We have been assisting to many life-cycle events streamed on Zoom, we are hoping that by the end of the month we will be able to hold small minimal ceremonies in person again," highlighted Ejnes.

Yamina Party head Naftali Bennett's brief sojourn as defense minister - just six months - was nothing short of a "tsunami' when it came to entrenching Israel's presence in the Judea and Samaria in advance of pending plans to annex 30% of the West Bank.
 One could argue that he was the right man, in the right place, at the right time. Bennett's predecessor, Yisrael Beytenu Party head Avigdor Liberman could not play that role, even though he actually lives in the Nokdim settlement. Time was not on his side. He served in the pre-elections period, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was nervous about taking bold actions in Judea and Samaria.
 True, during Liberman's two year tenure, he advanced a high number of settler housing tenders, approved the first new Jewish apartment building in Hebron in 16 years and allowed for families to move into the Beit Rachel and Beit Leah homes. Under his watch, an entirely new settlement was built, the first such community in over 20 years. It came, however, at the cost of the demolition of the symbolic Amona outpost. Equally significant, the Palestinian and Bedouin herding villages of Susya and Khan al-Ahmar remained standing, in spite of Liberman's pledges to remove them.
 During the period of the Obama administration, the Defense Ministry was among the more politically challenging posts. Right-wing politicians and activists often blamed the defense minister for Netanyahu's failures to advance their agenda in Judea and Samaria.
 Unlike Liberman, Bennett lives in Ra'anana. But his background as the former Yesha council director-general gave him an edge when it came to settlement activity. That was augmented by the timing of his brief tenure as defense minister. Unlike some of his predecessors, he is willing to throw diplomatic caution to the wind when it comes to support for Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria.
 Bennett was handed the Defense Ministry at the tail end of the most protracted election period in Israeli history, when Netanyahu had every reason to cater to the right and almost no need for diplomatic restraints.
 Netanyahu had already pledged to annex West Bank settlements prior to Bennett's arrival in the ministry. It was a move that was strengthened by the unveiling of US President Donald Trump's peace plan in January that allowed for the application of Israeli sovereignty over 30% of the West Bank, on land in Area C, later this year.
 Bennett enter his post historic moment in November 2019, when the Trump administration publicly changed its policy toward the Israeli settlement enterprises, stating that Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria were not 'inconsistent with international law.'
 Between that statement, the election and Trump's peace plan, Bennett had a wider latitude for action than his predecessors. He could do little with Gaza, but here, in the biblical heartland so dear to his voter base, he could make his mark.
 The Trump peace plan was unveiled on his watch and Netanyahu announced the advancement of plans for 3,500 apartment units in the contentious E1 section of the Ma'aleh Adumim settlement. It was a plan that had been frozen for years.
 But Bennett didn't rest on those laurels. One could argue that every project or action he took, would have needed the approval of Netanyahu. But it is also true, that when it came to the West Bank he was in an unusual position of power with regard to the prime minister.
 Since both men were vying for votes from the same right-wing audience, it was harder for Netanyahu to restrain Bennett, as he had other defense ministers, without taking a hit at the ballot box.
 Either way, Bennett was able to generate his own headlines out of the following dream list of projects.
 In December, Bennett allowed for planning to begin for residential Jewish apartments above the Hebron's former wholesale market place on the edge of the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. In May, he gave the final approval planning work to begin on the elevator project to make Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs wheelchair accessible. This involve seizing municipal planing power in Hebron from the Palestinian Authority. The absence of such powers had hampered the project's progress.
 Bennett built on Netanyahu's E1 plans by advancing work for what he called the "sovereignty road" in that area. This is a necessary bypass Palestinian road for the E1 project, that links the Palestinian village of Azzim outside of Jerusalem with the neighboring villages and towns of Anata, Hizma and a-Ram.
 In an expansion of Israel's land holding, seven nature were reserves were created in Judea and Samaria. In a move toward authorization 12 outposts were linked up to the electricity grid.
 Like Liberman, Bennett did not touch Khan al-Ahmar. But he otherwise did his best to make it easier to demolish illegal Palestinian construction in Area C, declaring in January that doing so was part of a campaign to ensure that the territory remained in Israeli hands. To show that he meant business, he appointed former Defense Ministry adviser Kobi Eleraz to head a task force on the matter. He also created a team to prepare the Defense Ministry for the application of sovereignty.
 To top it all off, he gave the initial green light to one of the largest West Bank construction projects, dubbed as E2, which would allow for the building of 7,000 new homes in the Efrat settlement. It's a move that would transform the community of some 10,000 people into a city.
 It is also viewed by Palestinians as a project that hampers the development of the neighboring Palestinian city of Bethlehem, which also had it eyes on that land.
 The sudden COVID-19 pandemic that engulfed the globe robbed Bennett of some of the limelight, but not all of the limelight. With each headline, Bennett took subtle digs at Netanyahu, who he believes should have already applied sovereignty to all of Area C, which at present is under Israeli military and civilian control.
 Bennett often uttered the phrase that the test of support for sovereignty is deeds, not words. It was a slogan aimed to create the impression that all Netanyahu had to offer was promises, but if one wanted to actually get something done, than he, Bennett, was the man for the job.
 There is a certain amount of cognitive dissonance in the decision by Bennett and his Yamina Party not to join Netanyahu's coalition, precisely at the moment when it appears that this is the government that will approve annexation. Bennett, after all, was one of the first high level right-wing politicians to talk about annexation, doing so when the subject was considered to be a diplomatic and political taboo.
 But even if a solution is found for the party to stay in the government, it is presumed at this juncture that Bennett will not continue on as defense minister.
 Bennett was in the Defense Ministry just long enough to link himself to high level projects, but not long enough to garner criticism should they fail to move forward.
 The savvy accumulation of such an action list means Bennett leaves the Defense Ministry with an enormous amount of capital to use for any future political campaign.
 This was his fifth ministerial post he has held since 2013. Although it's his shortest tenure as a minister, it is the first post that has given him the opportunity to flex his muscle when it comes to actions that so thoroughly advance the settlement enterprise.
 Its value, of course, will drop should Netanyahu make good on his pledge to annex West Bank territory. Its value will rise tremendously, however, should Netanyahu waver or delay on annexation.
 At that point the project advancement will become political gold for Bennett, who is one of Netanyahu's strongest right-wing opponents outside of the Likud. He can use these project to hammer Netanyahu, either from the government or from the opposition, to underscore a message that when it comes to executing a right-wing agenda, Bennett is the most certain bet.
