"It is regrettable, in light of the attitude of a public servant, that the prosecutor general refused the justice minister's request to hear his opinions in the process of a personnel reshuffle, a process stipulated by the prosecution office act," Prime Minister Lee was quoted as saying by his office.

Still, much of the fun is in looking through past records to see who's who in your bloodline. There are a couple of ways to get started. Google genealogy sites and you'll find plenty of options. One of the more popular is ancestry.com, a subscription service. You can build your family tree and research its ever-growing library of data. Be forewarned that there are many variations in so-called facts. Any given ancestor's name may be spelled various ways, a birthplace may be approximate, dates — birth, wedding, or death — can be all over the place or missing. But if you like puzzles, you'll enjoy gathering the references and seeing which are likely to be accurate.

So what to do? The answer is simple: Drink water. The number that's been bandied about for years is eight, 8-ounce glasses of water per day. That's not true for everyone, as bodies come in many shapes, sizes, and exact compositions of trace elements. But it can't hurt. It's unlikely you'll drink too much water, although hyponatremia, a condition where the salts in your blood become too dilute, is no fun.

The Brophy Sisters are a testimony to what can be accomplished when a family embraces music deeply. Though there's a nine-year gap between them, the culture of discipline and creativity cultivated through many years of homeschooling has forged a bond that flowers every time they play together. If that didn't happen for too long while they were in different parts of the country, look for more of their concerts around town, now that they've both moved closer to home. In fact, they're helping to kick off the new year at Crosstown Arts' live performance series on January 15th at the Green Room. That's just par for the course at one of the most eclectic venues in this or any other city. I spoke to sisters Maeve (piano) and Linnaea (violin) recently about a lifetime lived with the love of music, and the family support that helped make it happen.
