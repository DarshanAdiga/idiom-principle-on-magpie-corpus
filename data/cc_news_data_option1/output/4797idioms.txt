Alert: Michigan election board certifies victory for Biden, another setback in Trump’s effort to overturn election results - New Canaan Advertiser


--DocBreak--
Biden crushed the president by more than 330,000 votes in Wayne County, where two local GOP canvassers who certified the results unsuccessfully tried to reverse course last week after being called by Trump. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, has said an audit must wait until after statewide certification because only then would officials have legal access to documentation needed to conduct such a review.
 Michigan's elections bureau has recommended that the Nov. 3 results be certified.
 Norm Eisen, a constitutional law expert and former counsel to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, said there was no legal basis to do anything other than certify the election.
 "That is the clear mandate of state law," he said. Eisen dismissed various claims for why a delay might be necessary, including the need for an audit or time to investigate so-called "out of balance" precincts.
 "The reasons that they have advanced for doing anything other than (certify) is totally spurious. They carry no legal or factual weight whatsoever under the law," Eisen added.
 Trump has tried to defy the results of the election through the courts, but having found no luck there, moved on to personally trying to influence local lawmakers to convince them to ignore the popular vote and appoint Republican electors, a strategy that would send Americans into the streets in protest, election law experts have said.
 Some Trump allies have expressed hope that state lawmakers could intervene in selecting Republican electors in states that do not certify, as the president and his attorneys have pushed baseless allegations of fraud that have been repeatedly rejected in courtrooms across the country. Trump met with top Michigan GOP legislators at the White House on Friday and tweeted over the weekend: "We will show massive and unprecedented fraud!"
 Had the board delayed a vote or opposed certification, a lawsuit was expected. Legal experts have said the canvassers' role is limited and courts would order them to confirm the results. Under state law, it has the narrow responsibilities of reviewing vote numbers from Michigan's 83 counties and certifying them. It does not have the power to audit returns or investigate complaints of irregularities.
 In Pennsylvania, a conservative Republican judge shot down the Trump campaign's biggest legal effort in Pennsylvania with a scathing ruling that questioned why he was supposed to disenfranchise 7 million voters with no evidence to back their claims and an inept legal argument at best.
 But the lawyers still hope to block the state's certification, quickly appealing to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, which ordered lawyers to file a brief Monday but did not agree to hear oral arguments.
 The campaign, in its filings, asked for urgent consideration so they could challenge the state election results before they are certified next month. If not, they will seek to decertify them, the filings said.
 And they insisted that they did not want to invalidate all of the 6.8 million ballots cast in the state -- as Brann concluded based on their arguments in court last week. Instead, they said, they are taking aim only at seven Democratic-leaning counties where they take issue with how mail-in ballots were handled.
 "Appellants seek to exclude the defective mail ballots which overwhelming favored Biden, which may turn the result of the election," they said in a filing Monday said.
 Biden won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes. The other litigation has failed to change a single vote.
 Pennsylvania county election boards were voting on Monday, the state deadline, about whether to certify election results to the Department of State. The boards in two populous counties split along party lines, with majority Democrats in both places voting to certify. After all counties have sent certified results to Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, she must then tabulate, compute and canvass votes for all races. The law requires her to perform that task quickly but does not set a specific deadline.
 In Wisconsin, a recount in the state's two largest liberal counties moved into its fourth day at a slow pace, with election officials in Milwaukee County complaining that Trump observers were hanging up the process with frequent challenges. Trump's hope of reversing Biden's victory there depends on disqualifying thousands of absentee ballots -- including the in-person absentee ballot cast by one of Trump's own campaign attorneys in Dane County.

ATLANTA -- Georgia election officials are gearing up for another recount of the roughly 5 million ballots cast in the state's presidential election this month following a request over the weekend by President Donald Trump's campaign.
   
 State law allows Trump, who lost Georgia by fewer than 13,000 votes to President-elect Joe Biden, to seek a recount due to the narrow margin. The election results were certified last Friday after a statewide audit of every ballot that included a hand recount.
   
 The upcoming recount will run ballots through scanners rather than by hand, said Gabriel Sterling, the election systems manager in Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office. It will start at 9 a.m. Tuesday and must wrap up by the end of Dec. 2, posing challenges for a few counties like Fulton poised to hold local elections on Dec. 1.
   
 That process will not involve inspecting or matching signatures on absentee ballot envelopes, which Trump's allies have called for to weed out any potential instances of mail-in voter fraud - though so far no evidence has been presented of such widespread fraud in Georgia.
   
 State law and privacy concerns currently bar the close level of signature scrutiny that Trump and his Republican supporters in Georgia want, Sterling said at a news conference Monday. He also noted the initial verification steps were open for both political parties to watch, but neither did so.
   
 Absent specific fraud evidence or a court order, Sterling said state officials see no recourse to inspect signatures on absentee ballot envelopes at this point.
   
 "We anticipate that we will continue to follow the law and follow the process as we have done from the beginning," Sterling said. "So far, we have not seen anything widespread."
   
 Amid various fraud claims, Republican allies of Trump have homed in on mail-in signatures as the best way to test the election's integrity as the president still refuses to concede defeat. Gov. Brian Kemp, U.S. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, U.S. Rep. Doug Collins and the Georgia Republican Party have all pushed for more comprehensive signature verification.
   
 "We as [Georgia Republicans] will never give up on the fight to make sure that every lawful vote is counted and every unlawful vote rejected," state GOP Chairman David Shafer wrote Monday on Twitter.
   
 But moves to scrap absentee ballots by inspecting envelope signatures could face tough prospects in Georgia after a federal judge last week rejected a restraining order sought by a Trump ally to halt the election's certification until signatures could be verified further.
   
 Loeffler's and Perdue's Democratic runoff opponents, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, have slammed the two Republican senators for sowing distrust in Georgia's election system despite the election results' certification last week.
   
 Meanwhile, Raffensperger has urged state lawmakers to tighten Georgia law on verifying signature matches when the General Assembly next convenes, which currently would be the regular legislative session set for mid-January. The governor so far has not called for a special session before the runoffs.
   
 Mail-in voting looks to continue taking center stage in Georgia with runoff elections for the state's two U.S. Senate seats that have drawn intense interest across the country scheduled to be held on Jan. 5.
   
 Nearly 800,000 absentee-ballot applications already have been sent out for the runoffs, meaning next month will likely see similar mail-in voting numbers to the 1.3 million absentee ballots cast in the Nov. 3 elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ryan Germany, general counsel in Raffensperger's office.
   
 Georgia's two Senate runoff races are poised for high turnout due to their unique importance. Wins by both Democratic candidates over the Republican incumbent senators would give Democrats control over the White House and Congress for at least the next two years.
   
 Ahead of the runoffs, State Election Board members on Monday extended temporary rules put in place for the Nov. 3 elections that allow counties to install absentee-ballot drop boxes and scan absentee ballots a week before Election Day.
   
 Both the drop boxes and early scanning helped counties manage the unprecedented flood of mail-in ballots for the general election and look to do so again for the runoffs, Germany said Monday.
   
 "That is something I think all voters in Georgia will appreciate," Germany told members of the election board.
   
 The election board on Monday did not take up a proposed rule aimed at cracking down on potential out-of-state voters who may try to register to vote in Georgia for the runoffs amid recent rumors and reports of non-resident voters possibly attempting to do so.
   
 Republican leaders including Shafer and Collins have pressed Raffensperger to clamp down harder on voter residency requirements, while largely Democratic- aligned observers argue tougher rules could disenfranchise poorer Georgians and those in more fragile living situations.
   
 Germany said Raffensperger's and Attorney General Chris Carr's offices have agreed to send out an official bulletin advising county elections boards on specifics of Georgia's residency requirements and verifications, rather than pass any new rules on the matter.
   
 "We think that will accomplish the purpose that we want," Germany said.
   
 Early voting for the Senate runoff elections starts Dec. 14. The deadline for Georgia voters to register for the runoffs is Dec. 7.

The ongoing analyses will enable the group to prioritize how to proceed after the pandemic wanes and the economy recovers, officials said Monday. Grand Action 2.0 began discussing new projects — first identified in a 2016 study — shortly after reconvening early this year. The group commissioned Convention, Sports & Leisure International in Minneapolis, Minn., for a follow-up study. “Our mission to foster public-private collaborations on transformational projects that benefit health, science, the arts, education, economic vitality and the residents of the region became more relevant when the pandemic hit,” Grand Action 2.0 Co-Chair Carol Van Andel said today during a presentation to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids. “Our community’s economic recovery will be dependent in large part on the public and private sectors’ readiness to initiate new economic development activities that stimulate growth, investment and employment,” Van Andel said. “We knew our region had to be prepared to hit the ground running when the health crisis subsides. Unless we plan now, we know it will be much more difficult to recover from the devastating impacts on our local economy, our businesses, our workers and residents.” Grand Action envisions the development over the next decade or more of an outdoor amphitheater on city-owned property at 201 Market Ave. SW, a soccer and entertainment stadium that would host minor league professional soccer and other events, and future DeVos Place expansion that include a hotel. CSL International has met with dozens of stakeholders for a “real deep dive into the community and the potential customers for each of these venues, so when we start talking about projects and futures it’s built on a solid foundation of research,” said CSL International Principal John Kaatz. Grand Rapids “seems to be well-suited from the demand perspective” for a riverfront amphitheater on the 201 Market property that could host 40 or more events annually and draw more than 260,000 people, Kaatz said. An amphitheater could become a “signature attraction” for downtown that becomes “a community gathering space, 365 days a year” with sledding and skating in the winter, he said. “The idea is we create a year-around activity zone that happens to have an amphitheater in the middle of it that allows us to do those 40-plus events a year, in addition to various community events,” Katz said. “If we can achieve that, which we think we can, that creates a tremendous amount of vibrancy.” An amphitheater with a capacity for about 12,000 people would not compete with Van Andel Arena for concerts. Concert tours for amphitheaters “tend to be somewhat distinct,” Kaatz said. “There’s an outdoor tour that exists throughout the year. They tend not to go to arenas, so the overlap between Van Andel and a new amphitheater, we think, is fairly limited,” he said. The amphitheater also could spur peripheral development along both sides of the Grand River, Kaatz said. He spoke of the potential for a nearby aquarium, for example, as well as public spaces, picnic areas and “other commercial opportunities” such as office, retail and housing around 201 Market and a site at Market Avenue and Fulton Street. “This signature attraction concept could also be part of the overall waterfront development given the amount of space we have,” Kaatz said. Soccer, convention plans Once an ownership structure is formed around a soccer stadium, Grand Rapids has the demographics and ability to attract a minor league franchise, Katz said. A soccer stadium in Grand Rapids funded with a public-private sector partnership model would probably have roughly 7,000 seats with accompanying skyboxes and luxury suites, he said. The stadium could also host college and high school games, plus community events such as art and collector shows and corporate gatherings, he said. At DeVos Place, the focus over the next five years should involve identifying new meeting space, then looking at expansion and a new 300- to 500-room adjacent hotel in five to 10 years. Grand Action 2.0 for now is “very much in the information-gathering stage” on the project, Co-Chair Dick DeVos said. Whether each of the projects proceeds beyond concept will require the same kind of public-private partnerships to finance, Grand Action 2.0 Co-Chair Tom Welch said. Of the $420 million in projects the first iteration of Grand Action undertook, $130 million came through private philanthropy, Welch said. “The original model used for Grand Action 1.0 is exactly the way we’re going to move forward,” said Welch, the regional president for Fifth Third Bank. “We plan to continue to galvanize the public support and work with public and private parties to identify viable funding sources.”

Dean Winchester may be a little rough around the edges, but he's undoubtedly a good guy when all is said and done. Fans have come to know actor Jensen Ackles for his portrayal of the beloved monster hunter on _Supernatural_ over the last 15 years, and many relate him to the character. With _Supernatural_ now in the past, Ackles is heading over to Amazon Prime Video for a role in the third season of _The Boys_ , and his new character will be the polar opposite of Dean. Soldier Boy, the original Supe, is going to be every bit as nasty as Dean was heroic, but there is one thread tying the two roles together.
 Ackles recently spoke with _EW_ about the end of _Supernatural_ , and he mentioned that Dean and Soldier Boy actually share an unexpected bond. The boots that Ackles was given for Soldier Boy are the same kind of boots that he wore on _Supernatural_ for a decade and a half.
 "Through no planning or work of my own devices, I somehow managed to end up with the same kind of boots for Soldier Boy that I wore for Dean Winchester," Ackles said. "Different color but same boot. They had given me a variety and I immediately looked at them and I just chuckled, and I was like, 'Well I can tell you which ones I know work.'"
 Ackles' move from _Supernatural_ to _The Boys_ may not come as much of a surprise when you pay attention to who's behind the scenes. _The Boys_ executive producer Eric Kripke was behind the creation of _Supernatural_ 15 years ago, and he has been more than excited to work with Ackles on set once again.

 "I think anyone expecting Jensen to show up and be a good guy, they will be disappointed. I'll say that! [Laughs]," Kripke told _Variety_. "In the comics he's mostly just kind of bumbling and subservient to Homelander, I would say. As we're writing him in this, we're getting to really talk about the history of Vought because he's like John Wayne. He's one of these guys that's been around for decades of Vought history. And he was Homelander before Homelander, so he's from a different era, but he's got the ego and the ambition -- it just comes across in a different way because he's from a different time."
 There isn't yet a release date for the third season of _The Boys_ , but the new episodes are expected to arrive on Prime Video sometime in 2021.

The Michigan Democratic Party sent a letter to the Board of State Canvassers Sunday urging board members to "carry out your responsibility under Michigan law" and certify the results of the 2020 general election.
   
 "This is a simple but fundamental step. Our system of government draws its power from the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box," the letter, signed by Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes, said.
   
 "That will, which lies at the foundation of the state and federal constitutions to which each of you -- like every elected official in the State of Michigan -- has sworn an oath, must be given effect."
   
 The letter was sent one day after the Michigan Republican Party and the Republican National Committee sent a joint letter to the Michigan Board of State Canvassers asking the body to delay certification of Michigan's statewide election results for 14 days and audit Wayne County's general election results.
   
 The Board of State Canvassers is scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. Monday, Nov. 23, to certify Michigan's election results.
   
 Barnes in the Democratic Party letter wrote that most of the Republican Party's claims of irregularities have been dismissed by courts and that President Donald Trump and Republicans have used the weeks following the election to spread falsehoods and sow doubt in Michigan's democratic process.
   
 "Their fundamental concern, of course, is not with the process at all, but instead with its result -- that more than 2.8 million Michiganders cast ballots for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, constituting 154,187 more votes than those cast for Donald Trump and Mike Pence. But they attempt to mask their actual concern with baseless allegations," the letter said.
   
 The Michigan Democratic Party letter says that Republicans appear concerned about the number of unbalanced precincts in Detroit, although there is no claim that the unbalanced precincts result from anything other than a clerical error. Any existing imbalance nominally affects the vote total, according to the letter.
   
 "The total imbalance implicates at most 450 votes, i.e., 0.029% of the margin that separates President-Elect Biden from President Trump," the letter reads. "The imbalance is also much smaller than it was in 2016. In that election, in which President Trump prevailed by 10,704 votes statewide, more than 58% of Detroit's precincts had unexplained imbalances. This year, only 28% did."
   
 In the case of absentee ballots, an out-of-balance precinct can happen because the scanners may accidentally fail to catch a person's name on the envelope, Detroit Mayor Duggan said Wednesday.
   
 "They put the ballot through the machine," he said. "They may think the scanner caught the person's name, but if it didn't, it doesn't record at the end of the night, you could have 541 ballots and 540 scanned names. It just means the bar scanner missed. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong."
   
 Barnes wrote that as a Michigander, voter and chairperson of the Democratic Party, she only asks for what the people of Michigan deserve.
   
 "The Board should follow state law and certify the clear results of the 2020 election so that the officials elected by the people of this state may get to work on the many challenges that await them," she wrote. "Certification was straightforward in 2016, just as it should be this year. The strength and dependability of our democracy does not depend on the identity of the prevailing candidates."
   
 The Republicans in their letter argued that "to simply gloss over those irregularities now without a thorough audit would only foster feelings of distrust among Michigan's electorate."
   
 "In light of the already unprecedented nature of this election -- conducted largely by mail in the midst of an ongoing pandemic -- it would be a grievous dereliction of this Board's duty to the people of Michigan not to ensure that the irregularities identified by the James campaign are thoroughly investigated by a full audit before certifying Wayne County's results."
   
 The alleged irregularities claimed by Trump and others, even if true, would not overturn the results in the state. Election law experts have said the board is required to certify the results. Civil rights leaders have said the delay in certifying the results would disenfranchise mostly minority voters.
   
 The staff of the state board released a report Friday recommending certification of the vote and saying Detroit experienced fewer problems in the Nov. 3 general election than the August primary and the 2016 presidential election.

ATLANTA -- A lawyer for the Sierra Club asked a Fulton County Superior Court judge Monday to prohibit Georgia Power from passing on $525 million in coal ash cleanup costs to its customers.
   
 But lawyers for the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) and Georgia Power argued the Atlanta-based utility fully justified both its cleanup plan and the costs of that work during hearings before the PSC last year.
   
 Robert Jackson, the lawyer representing the Sierra Club, asked Judge Shukura Millender to declare the pollution of groundwater by Georgia Power's ash ponds at 11 coal-fired power plants "unlawful," or at least "unreasonable and imprudent." Such a ruling would disqualify the company from recovering the costs of the cleanup from ratepayers, he said.
   
 "Georgia Power has coal ash sitting in groundwater at plants Bowen, Hammond, Scherer, Wansley and Yates," Jackson said. "If it had complied with Georgia environmental law, these expensive environmental remediation costs could have been avoided."
   
 Georgia Power is working on a multi-year plan to close all 29 of its coal ash ponds at the 11 power plants to meet federal regulations for handling coal ash, which contains toxic chemicals that can pollute drinking water supplies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cracked down on pollution from ash ponds in 2015 after a massive spill at a plant in Tennessee.
   
 The PSC signed off on Georgia Power's coal ash cleanup proposals In July 2019 as part of its latest Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), an update of plans for meeting the state's energy needs the utility submits every three years. The commission then followed up on that vote late last year by incorporating the costs of the cleanup in a rate increase for Georgia Power.
   
 Jackson argued Monday that the PSC decided to allow Georgia Power to pass on those costs to customers without any evidence that they were incurred lawfully or reasonably.
   
 But Dan Walsh, a lawyer representing the PSC, said Georgia Power justified those costs during last year's proceedings before the commission. In bringing the issue to court, the Sierra Club is essentially seeking to relitigate the case, he said.
   
 "The evidence Georgia Power presented of the costs it would incur … were sufficient to justify permitting cost recovery [from customers]," Walsh said. "By arguing the evidence relied upon by the commission is inadequate, the Sierra Club is asking the court to second guess the commission on the weight it afforded to the evidence."
   
 Tom Reilly, the lawyer representing Georgia Power, dismissed the Sierra Club's argument that the company has acted unlawfully in its disposal of coal ash. Neither the EPA nor the Georgia Environmental Protection Division have accused Georgia Power of breaking the law, and there are no pending enforcement actions related to coal ash, he said.
   
 "If the Sierra Club had an issue about the activities being undertaken and whether they were insufficient and improper, it should have made the argument in the IRP," Reilly said.
   
 Jackson said none of the voluminous testimony filed in last year's proceedings dealt directly with Georgia Power's request to make customers pick up the tab for the coal ash cleanup.
   
 "These plans are draft remediation plans for what Georgia Power plans to do when it closes these coal ash ponds," he said. "None of these documents say anything about whether it's just or reasonable or prudent to pass these costs on to their ratepayers."
   
 Judge Millender said she would take the various parties' arguments under advisement and issue a written ruling.

If Resident Evil Revelations 3 truly is in the works from Capcom, it would be interesting to see what form the game might take. The original _Resident Evil Revelations_ was a handheld game that eventually saw release in HD. The game's follow-up, however, was initially released as an episodic series. Besides the gameplay, the most notable connection between the two games is the fact that both take place between the main series entries, filling in some of the gaps in the overall Resident Evil storyline. The first _Revelations_ takes place between _Resident Evil 4_ and _5_ , while the sequel takes place between _Resident Evil 5_ and _6_. The games also tend to star some of the more popular characters from the franchise, as well.
 Of course, it would also be interesting to see what platforms a third Resident Evil Revelations game might end up on. The previous two entries have released on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. As of this writing, _Resident Evil Village_ has only been announced for next-gen consoles. It remains to be seen whether or not a third Revelations would similarly release exclusively on next-gen platforms, or if Capcom would keep the series on current platforms for those that haven't upgraded just yet.

 For now, fans will just have to wait and see what Capcom announces next. With _Resident Evil Village_ rumored to release in April, and a live-action film reboot in the works, it seems that there's a lot for fans of the franchise to get excited about, at the moment!

A grandmother of 17 children has taken to video conferencing software to keep up Christmas baking traditions. Clare native Mary Dunne (78) who lives in Ardee, Co Louth, last week took to Zoom to make her traditional Christmas pudding.Through the software, she was able to keep up a long-running tradition of letting her grandchildren make a wish once she stirred the mixture three times to the audience of nine children, three of them in Belgium.She said that learning to use digital technology and video conferencing software is a way to bridge the digital gap between the generations.&ldquo;The first step is getting rid of your fears, after that it is plain sailing and young people can play a great role in connecting older people remotely, especially if they are apart from loved ones over Christmas,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;When I was doing the Christmas pudding, I got the three grandchildren in Brussels, three in Malahide, Dublin and the others in Ardee, on screen.&ldquo;I put a little Santa figure on the bowl so he was stirring with a wooden spoon and I counted one, two, three and they all made a wish – there was great excitement,&rdquo; she said.Ms Dunne has fully embraced technology, using a laptop, iPad, iPhone and Apple watch to stay in touch with family and friends, and has won an Age Action IT Enthusiast award.She has backed a Louth County Council initiative which sees younger people act as &quot;superconnectors&quot; and teach their older relatives how to use technology to stay connected over the festive season.The council&rsquo;s Public Participation Network (PPN) co-ordinator, Grainne Carroll, said the campaign also aims to connect children with relatives living overseas and unable to return home this year.&ldquo;If you want to do something really meaningful this Christmas, make sure you can say you connected someone,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We are asking children to use software such as TeamViewer to take control of their grandparents&rsquo; screens, set up accounts and teach them how to use apps in real time,&rdquo; said Mary Deery, the council&rsquo;s Age Friendly co-ordinator.&ldquo;Older people need technology in their hands for practical things but also to combat the loneliness and isolation of Covid-19 – so giving them a helping hand on tech could be the ultimate gift this Christmas.&rdquo;

Testing protocols are in place and, as the college football season has shown us with the cancellation of a handful of games every weekend, all participants will need to be able to adjust on the fly.

McIntyre said she plans to pare down her usual Thanksgiving, typically 15 to 20 family members at her house, to a total of 10 people. Face masks will be required, she said. There will be temperature checks and hand sanitizer at the door. People will sit well apart at multiple dinner tables. McIntyre said she will use paper plates and plastic utensils, to avoid dishwashing that could spread the virus.
 McIntyre said people should consider a Thanksgiving dinner outdoors, if weather permits. The latest National Weather Service forecast predicts a wet Wednesday for central Alabama, with a 20 percent chance of rain early Thanksgiving morning and a mostly sunny day with a high of 68 degrees.

“Let’s make sure we’re staging this in a way that we have the opportunity to put on the brake at some point,” he said, “and we’re not making representations that are going to end up obligating us, open ended, with water and filters and so forth down the road.”
 The type of firefighting foam that led to the issue is required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
 Airport Director Jim Elwood said the airport’s $16 million in Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act funds could be used to cover some of the PFAS expenses.
 The EPA does not yet regulate PFAS, though the federal agency is developing an action plan for the substances, which are found in such everyday items as Teflon and are considered an emerging health hazard.
 Animal studies suggest that PFAS —sometimes called “forever chemicals” because of their tenacity in the environment and living tissue — can cause developmental issues in infants during pregnancy, and have been linked to cancer, liver, thyroid and immune system issues.
 When Jackson Hole Airport first went looking for the chemicals under its own property last winter, the groundwater tested at a maximum of 382 parts per trillion — more than five times the EPA’s recommended limit. Residential tap water from nearby homes, however, almost all tested below the threshold, with just one home barely exceeding the limit.
 Jackson Hole Airport has been proactive about addressing perfluoroalkyl substance pollution compared with other airports, its board members say.
 “It’s not a high agenda item, relative to aeronautics,” Jerry Blann said. “Nobody is prioritizing it like we are.”
 The longtime board member said that moving forward on the issue was “very, very important,” and that the next phase of testing should be as broad as the board can make it.
 “I think this airport has always taken the high road as far as environmental leadership across the board,” Blann said, “and I think we should continue to do that.”

The results have to be certified. Then the electors have to vote, which takes place, uh, in December. But even after that, I don't think Trump will do it. I think what will have to happen is that Trump's or Biden's team, excuse me, will have to file a lawsuit to Sue them, to release the material. The Supreme court will have to rule on it. Um, and I'm sure as sure as I can be, they will say, yes, you have to cooperate with the transition. Otherwise Biden could turn around and if a Republican replaces him, just say, no, I'm not going to do it, but that's why I think they would go for Biden over Trump in this instance. But it's still going to put them behind, right? They're not going to be as caught up as they should be. They're not going to be as on the ball as they should be.

The song plays to Billie's strengths. The driving beat, spoken verse interjections, and distorted layers of vocals are devilish, and the incriminating lyrics add to a tongue-in-cheek and crafty sound. It's wry, puckish and wicked-sounding -- a head-bobber of the 'all the good girls go to hell' variety. Though the song doesn't add anything particularly new to her catalogue, it can't be said that the singer-songwriter isn't playing to her strengths. Following the more sombre 'My Future' and 'everything i wanted', 'Therefore I Am' is a welcome uptempo break. Perhaps textbook for Eilish, but likeable nonetheless.

India on Monday briefed the envoys of a select group of countries, including the US and Russia, on the Pakistani origins of the Jaish- e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists who attempted to carry out an attack in Jammu and Kashmir last week. The group of envoys, which also included the heads of mission of France and Japan, were provided a "detailed information docket" with details of the planned attack and a list of items and munitions recovered from the terrorists that "clearly indicated their Pakistani origins", said a person familiar with the development who spoke on condition of anonymity. The envoys were briefed on how the terrorists sneaked into India through an underground tunnel in the Samba sector, and how preliminary investigations by police and intelligence agencies and markings on AK-47 rifles and other items have led India to conclude the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based JeM. The briefing by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on the attempted attack at Nagrota in Jammu and Kashmir that was foiled on November 19 also focused on the "implications of the incident on security, diplomacy and the battle against terrorism", the person said. While the envoys of at least three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council were invited for the briefing, the Chinese ambassador was not among those present, people familiar with the development said. On November 20, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces in Jammu and Kashmir had foiled a plan by JeM to "wreak major havoc and destruction" by killing four members of the group and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives. The four terrorists were gunned down during a gun battle on the Jammu-Srinagar highway a day earlier. India had summoned Pakistan's charge d'affaires Aftab Hassan Khan on November 21 and warned that New Delhi is "committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard its national security". India also demanded that Pakistan should desist from its policy of supporting terrorists and dismantle the terror infrastructure on its territory. Monday's briefing was the first of several to be conducted by the external affairs ministry for small groups of envoys in view of the Covid-19 situation. Several secretaries in the ministry will brief heads of missions from countries in their areas of jurisdiction. "The idea is to share information on the attempted attack as widely as possible with the international community," said a second person. The envoys were told during the briefing that the incident of November 19 was part of Pakistan's ongoing terror campaign in Jammu and Kashmir and that in 2020 itself, there were some 200 incidents of terrorist violence while 199 terrorists had been neutralised. Details of JeM's involvement in similar incidents in the past were also shared with the envoys. "In terms of the bigger picture, it is clear the terrorists were planning the biggest terror attack in India since the Pulwama suicide bombing of February 2019 and the implications can be guessed," said the first person. Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed in the Pulwama attack. "This is part of ongoing efforts to sabotage the district development council elections in Jammu and Kashmir and carry out a terror attack aimed to coincide with the anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes," the first person added. The envoys were also sensitised to India's concerns regarding Pakistan's sustained efforts to destabilise the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and to subvert local elections and democracy, the people said. ...

This week, the airport’s board of directors decided in a meeting to vastly expand the search area, authorizing the expense of 144 additional tests that environmental consultants say will help better define the scope of the plume of so-called “forever chemicals” migrating underground.
 “If we’re going to make a mistake, we’re going to over-test rather than under- test,” Bob McLaurin told his fellow board members. “I understand this is a long-term problem, and we don’t know where it’s going to end up, but given the nature of where the airport is — the national park — I would prefer to err on the side of more testing than less.”
 Jackson Hole Airport is expanding its search for perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, traced to aircraft firefighting foam.
 The expanded search for the chemicals doesn’t come cheap, with the voluntary testing costing up to $188,000. Board members also authorized a number of other PFAS-related expenses: $21,000 for continued monitoring of well water off the airport site, $54,000 for semiannual groundwater monitoring on airport grounds and $53,000 for a “pump-and-treat” engineering study to be conducted by Jackson Hole Airport’s on-contract environmental consultant, Mead and Hunt.
 An additional $30,000 was approved for water filtration systems and drinking water if more residential wells test above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s health advisory levels. Forty-five filtration systems have already been purchased and installed at nearby residences that depend on well water.
 There was some discussion Wednesday of runaway costs related to addressing the PFAS issue.
 “We in July said that the worst-case scenario was going to be $128,000,” airport board member John Eastman said. “I was — I still am — in favor of addressing this, obviously. But now, based on these remediations and different phases and the plans that are in front of us, we’re over $2 million.
