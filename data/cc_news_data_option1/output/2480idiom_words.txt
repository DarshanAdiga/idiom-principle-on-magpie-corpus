Yigal Unna, the Director-General of Israel's National Cyber Directorate later acknowledged the "synchronized and organized attack."
 While he didn't mention Iran by name, speaking at Cybertech Live Asia, Unna said that the attack was the first of its kind in history and that such attacks will only become more sophisticated and deadlier.
 "If the bad guys had succeeded in their plot we would now be facing, in the middle of the corona crisis, very big damage to the civilian population and a lack of water and even worse than that," he said. "Cyber winter is coming, and coming even faster than I suspected."
 Regarded as Israel's equivalent of the NSA in the United States, the soldiers of one of the IDF's most coveted units, Unit 8200, intercept and collect digital communication and intelligence on Israel's enemies.
 Spread across the country, these online soldiers of Unit 8200 are on the frontline of Israel's cyberwars 24/7, 365 days a year to identify possible threats and effectively neutralize them.
 While the military statement did not specifically name the attack against Iran's port as the operation the troops were awarded certificates for, a senior officer in the unit said in a recent interview that "about half of Unit 8200 is engaged in operational activity beyond Israel's borders."
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Iran of conducting daily cyberattacks on the country and that "everything today is vulnerable and under attack."
 Speaking at a cybersecurity conference last year Netanyahu said that  "Iran attacks Israel on a daily basis. We monitor these attacks, we see these attacks, and we thwart these attacks. All the time. We're not oblivious to these threats, they don't impress us. Because we know what our power is, both in defense and in the offense."
