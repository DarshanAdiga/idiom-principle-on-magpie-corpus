South Africa on Saturday surpassed 500,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, representing more than 50% of all reported coronavirus infections in Africa’s 54 countries.
 Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize announced 10,107 new cases Saturday night, bringing the country’s cumulative total to 503,290, including 8,153 deaths.
 South Africa, with a population of about 58 million, has the fifth-highest number of cases in the world, behind the U.S., Brazil, Russia and India, all countries with significantly higher populations, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll of the pandemic worldwide is much higher than confirmed cases, due to limited testing and other reasons.
 “Half a million is a significant milestone, because it shows we’ve entered a stage of rapid increases. We may reach 1 million cases very quickly,” said Denis Chopera, a virologist based in Durban. “What we know for sure is that the figures are an underestimate and that this virus will be with us for a long time to come.”

In anticipation of a large protest Saturday afternoon near its police department headquarters, the city of La Mesa announced a temporary executive order Saturday morning banning weapons, boards, spray paint and other items within a two-block downtown zone that includes the police department, city hall and city library. It also temporarily shut down the on and off ramps for La Mesa exits on Interstate 8.
 The city said the move is meant to proactively avoid a repeat of the violence that occurred on May 30, when a peaceful protest over police use of force turned into a riot with injuries, arrests, damage to downtown businesses, fires and looting. The freeway closures are also meant to avoid protesters marching on to the freeway and blocking traffic as they did in late May and early June.
 Th executive order for the downtown area went into effect at noon Saturday and will be in force until 5:30 a.m. Sunday morning. The protected zone is a triangular area bounded by University Avenue, Allison Drive and Spring Street. Early Saturday morning, new fencing and concrete and plastic barriers were erected around the city’s police department headquarters.

“Every lower court to consider the question has ruled President Trump’s border wall illegal, and the Supreme Court’s temporary order does not decide the case. We’ll be back before the Supreme Court soon to put a stop to Trump’s xenophobic border wall once and for all," Dror Ladin, staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement following the court's order Friday.

That doesn't mean anything goes. This isn't a town square. It's my website and I tone-police. If you think the only reason we could possibly disagree is that I, or any of my contributors, is Dutch, a European leftie, a racist or paid by a country or political party, then don't bother. Similarly if you believe the best way to persuade people is to pepper your arguments with insults. If you think that's unfair, may I suggest Twitter?

"For a country that is 90 miles away, for a policy that we've had decades [and] hasn't worked, I think opening up relationships is the best way to go," Bass said this week. "But I certainly understand the sensitivity and, to me saying that, the understanding that the translation in Spanish communicated something completely different. Lesson learned."

One of eight Marines rescued from the water later died.
 All of the Marines aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based at nearby Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego. They ranged in age from 19 to early 30s and all were wearing combat gear, including body armor and flotation vests, Lt. Gen. Joseph Osterman, commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, said earlier this week.
 The craft was one of 13 amphibious assault vehicles that participated in the routine exercise and was heading back to a Navy ship when the accident happened.
 Troops on board two other amphibious assault vehicles responded quickly but couldn’t stop the sinking, Osterman said.
