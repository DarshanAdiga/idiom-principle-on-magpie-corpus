ROCK 'N' ROLL arrives in '55, announced by Bill Haley and the Comets' "Rock Around the Clock," packaged as the opening music for the film "Blackboard Jungle." It starts behind the credits and continues as new teacher Glenn Ford approaches an urban vocational school. The boys have the music in their heads, dancing to it, nodding to the beat. Ford is walking into an alien landscape, with JDs (juvenile delinquents) who care nothing about jazz or pop (or school). Not that I and other middle-class teens identified with the greasers, but we recognized a music we could dance to, a music that separated us from our parents and teachers. Interesting subtext too in showing integrated classrooms, rare in many parts of the country in 1955.

The impeachment of Tharaka-Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki as deputy speaker on Friday didn’t come as a surprise to him.
 Prof Kindiki couldn’t have put it better himself, stating in his solemn speech before the guillotine that “the die is cast”.
 The majority of the hangmen-cum-priests, while generously flattering in the performance of their last rites, had made it clear that they would not show him any mercy.
 Only last week, he had watched Kipchumba Murkomen and Susan Kihika, the other high-ranking members of their rebel camp, put to the sword.
 In January, Ferdinand Waititu, then-Kiambu governor, was also brought in and finished, just like that.
 The big question many people watching the ongoing purge targeting Deputy President William Ruto’s loyalists in the ruling Jubilee Party will be asking is: who’s next?
