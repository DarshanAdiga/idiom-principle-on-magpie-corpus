Currently, there are several additional factors influencing the speed of the recovery. After the 2008 crisis, it took almost 3 years for the economies to return to the earlier export levels, which means a relatively slow, prolonged recovery. The global economy hit the low point of the crisis in 2009 Q1 and then generally started to recover after that. The euro-areadebt crisis in 2011-2012made the recovery more difficult for the EU countries. However, the speed of the recovery now depends not only on the level of development, the economic resilience and the monetary and fiscal impulses characteristic for the particular region, but also on the timing of the coronavirus outbreak and the length of the resulting standstills in the manufacturing and services sectors. As the virus peaks or will reach its peak at different times around the world, the impacts on industrial production and supply chains will also spread across different time frames. Currently, it is extremely difficult to gauge the durability of the Chinese and European recoveries or to tell when the virus will die down in North and South America, the Middle East and India. A possible second wave of Covid-19poses further significant uncertainties.

I never made it all the way through Jerzy Kosinski's bleak and brooding 1965 novel "The Painted Bird." By the time I tried, it had won the National Book Award, and was being recommended to me by friends who read all of the "important" books of the day. I put it down - and never picked it up again - right after a scene in which a drunk old man attacked a younger man who he believed was staring at his wife, dug the victim's eyes out with a spoon, then tossed them on the floor.
 Yes, the scene is in the bleak and brooding, yet haunting and hypnotic, and gorgeously photographed black and white movie. But the appalling deed is staged in a manner that can be watched without revulsion, though we do get to see the eyeballs on the floor.
 No, this is not a psychological horror film in which a supernatural demon possesses people and makes them commit grisly acts. Rather, it's a psychological horror film about survival and resiliency in the midst of inconceivable and very real horror.
 Set in the latter stages of WWII in some unnamed Eastern European country, it presents the wrong place-wrong time somewhat picaresque story of a young boy (first-time actor Petr Kotlar) whose apparently once-normal life has been turned upside down. He's a wanderer on a devastated landscape, trying to "get home," wherever that may be and to whoever may be there.
 The film is cut up into chapters, each titled with a reference to a person or people that our innocent, sad, lonely protagonist - who looks to be about 8 years old - eventually meets up with. He hardly speaks (just a few words here and there), no one calls him by name (it's revealed near the end), and the reason that he's alone in the world isn't made clear (though that, too, is disclosed near the end).
 He's living in a small farmhouse with his stern Aunt Marta, doing chores, being assured that he'll "only be here for a while," and making wishful drawings of him with his parents. Marta wasn't kidding about his time there, as she dies shortly afterward, and he sets off down the road, his journey about to begin.
 The Czech director Vaclav Marhoul, who also adapted the Kosinski novel, keeps the focus on human suffering - some of it emotional, some of it physical - and though it's a mostly somber and grueling experience to sit through, Marhoul's continual use of closeups on the beatific face of the boy somehow humanizes the film.
 That proves to be quite an achievement with so much direness, especially in the actions of other people, going on around him. The boy's visit to the first of many villages along the road results in the locals believing he's an evil spirit. After being driven away, he's taken in by an old miller, his younger wife, and a mill worker. You've already been warned about the eyeball scene. He's soon on the road again, living with and working for a man who catches wild songbirds and sells them, and who is regularly visited by a young woman who gets pleasure out of giving the man pleasure.
 But wherever the boy lands, things go very wrong, for him and for others, and he is always right at the center, suffering and seeing others suffer. The journey continues, and he can do nothing but take it all in, rarely understanding what's happening. WWII rears its ugly head in attacks involving Germans, Russians, Cossacks, and villagers who have gotten in their way. An appalling sequence features Jewish prisoners breaking out of a moving train, only to be mowed down by Nazi soldiers. The boy is there, a witness to the aftermath and later, at another locale, becoming a victim of depravity.
 Part of the film's overwhelming strength is its detachment from some of these events, achieved by using very little dialogue and by filling the screen with unknown faces. A slight drawback is the recognizable cameos by Udo Kier, Harvey Keitel, Julian Sands, Stellan Skarsgard and Barry Pepper that briefly pull you out of the film's grip.
 Fortunately, everything keeps returning to the boy and his practically expressionless face and thoughts of how much more of this he can take. Remarkably, the film has an ending that achieves a degree of peace amidst the constant turmoil in the almost three hours that precede it.
 "The Painted Bird" premieres on VOD and streaming services on July 17.

I am writing in opposition to the proposed Estover Terrace development, which the City Council will be considering on July 20.
 I don’t want the city to give up on its vision of adding more owner-occupied housing, and more small developments, just because no developer is submitting proposals that match that vision.
 Of course they aren’t. Those are not the kinds of projects that bring big profits to developers. But there are other options.
 The developer proposes building 156 units, only 20 of which would be owner- occupied – and these would only get built several years down the line – and maybe not at all. This developer has a history of making pretty significant changes to his plans down the road (Whisper Ridge, for instance).

Hugh Christie secondary school in Tonbridge, Kent, has launched an internal investigation, after a teacher asked Year 9 students to fill out a form with who they thought were the most attractive in their class.
 The 13 and 14 year-old students were given the forms as part of their end-of- year celebration assembly awards.
 ## ‘Best looking’ nominations
 They were asked to name the “best looking” male and female classmates and give a reason for their choice.
 Other categories included best couple, biggest ego, and biggest poser, while two boxes were left blank to let pupils come up with their own categories.
 Pupils were asked to complete the form and return it back to a teacher by 5 July, more than two weeks after they were given it to fill in.

But they were seen as a threat by the state trooper, she added.
 “It was very disheartening and disappointing to see how we were treated,” Brandy said. “At the end of the day, we’re still Black.”
 Brandy said when a downpour ensued with no warning in the middle of Myers’s speech, Melton and Ford urged the crowd to move into the Statehouse for shelter. Upon reflection, Brandy said this was the only option because the outdoors quickly became dangerous. She added that a tree broke not too far from where the crowd was initially assembled on the south lawn of the Statehouse.
 “Thank goodness for Sen. Melton and Sen. Ford,” Brandy said. “We would have been injured.”
 Brandy said a first altercation occurred when Statehouse staff approached Melton and asked why the crowd was gathered. Melton tried to explain why they needed to host their event inside, Brandy recalled, but he was only heard with Ford’s help.
 Soon after, Myers continued his speech, but all eyes were focused on what happened behind him, Brandy said. That was when two state troopers approached, and when Ford and Melton met them to explain why the event was now inside. The four began to talk, but it was apparent that Melton was being dismissed, while Ford — a white man — was respected, Brandy said. Melton kept his hands down, she said, and made no sudden movements.
 “You could just visibly see the difference between how they were able to address the officers,” Brandy said.
 This incident connects to a larger problem in the country about race relations, Brandy said. Melton was not combative, but he was still seen as dangerous.
