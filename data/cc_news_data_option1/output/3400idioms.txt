The Marvel universe has crossed over with Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 2 Season 4, and now the island is filled with references to the Avengers, X-Men, and more. You probably noticed you start on a SHIELD helicarrier rather than the normal spawn island, and you may have seen the Quinjets blast past the battle bus when you drop onto the island. These Quinjets land all over the map and contain useful gear and weapons, but they're guarded by Stark robots armed with Stark Industries Energy Rifles. One of the weekly challenges tasks you with destroying these Stark robots though, so you're going to have to fight a few of them.

The book chronicles the history of Prof. Kwamena Ahwoi's working relationship with the former President.      Prof. Ahwoi disclosed, in his an book, an incident where Mr. Rawlings squeezed the testicles of a former Upper West Regional Minister, Bede Ziedeng resulting in the latter's exit from the party.      He recounted that the former President meted out such vicious attack on Bede Ziedeng because he was opposed to the election of the late President John Evans Atta Mills as Presidential candidate of the NDC in 2002.      The book further gave other accounts of the things that happened during the military regime of the former President Jerry John Rawlings.      Prof. Kwamena Ahwoi was one of the long-serving Ministers in the Rawlings administration.      In a quick response to Prof. Kwamena Ahwoi, the former President has denied the historic accounts of the book.      He referred to the book as an ''opportunistic and calculated attempt to ridicule President Rawlings and former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman- Rawlings, using the personality of the late President John Atta Mills as the bait''.      ''Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. President Rawlings has over the past four decades tolerated various views, recognizing the fact that as a public figure one will not be immune to such, even when said opinions are vicious and derogatory. This book is quite unfortunately, riddled with countless fabrications and assumptions ascribed to said individuals who were thought to have more honour'', he said.      Mr. Rawlings therefore addressed the erroneous contents of the book in an 11-page statement copied to Peacefmonline.com.      ''A number of personalities that the author refers to and others, have written publicly to disassociate themselves from the comments in the book. A clear indication of the credibility or lack thereof of its contents. This book appears to have no aim of serving history with facts...From the inception, the author has harboured his own parochial agenda which clashed naturally with the integrity and accountability of Rawlings. Those of such ilk will continue to attempt to rewrite history to suit their selfish ends, but discerning minds will no longer be reticent of nor willing to tolerate such political trickery and subterfuge'', the statement from Mr. Rawlings' office further read.      Read full statement below:      THE INTEGRITY OF TRUTH – STATEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT RAWLINGS      The Office of Former President Jerry John Rawlings, has noted with concern contents of a book titled ‘Working with Rawlings’, authored by a former appointee of the PNDC and NDC who now calls himself Professor Kwamena Ahwoi.      The book attempts to chronicle the history of the role Kwamena Ahwoi played as an appointee of the former President, but disappointingly employs fabrications and grapevine accounts to paint a denigrating picture of President Rawlings and his colleagues.      Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. President Rawlings has over the past four decades tolerated various views, recognizing the fact that as a public figure one will not be immune to such, even when said opinions are vicious and derogatory.      However, the public deserve to be served the truth as far as some of the contents of the book are concerned.      The book is generously economical with the truth given that President Rawlings supported President Mills consistently from the year 2000, much to the chagrin of many of those who morphed into his post-victory supporters in 2006.

YSR Congress Party MLA from Vemuru M. Nagarjuna has said that TDP national president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu has been shedding crocodile tears on the welfare of Dalits and other weaker sections.
 Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Nagarjuna said, “The sincerity of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy can be seen from the fact that he has appointed a Dalit woman as Home Minister and five others from the weaker sections as Ministers.”
 Mr. Naidu had no right to speak about the welfare of Dalits, he said, and alleged that atrocities against them had been committed during his term in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore and Chittoor districts.
 “Mr. Naidu had once wondered whether anyone would be willing to be born in a Dalit family. Doesn’t the statement show Mr. Naidu’s attitude towards Dalits?” he questioned, and added that as per the National Crime Records Bureau, the State stood in the fourth place in the atrocities committed against the weaker sections during the TDP term. Mr. Nagarjuna said that social boycott of Dalits was witnessed during Mr. Naidu’s term.
 The Chief Minister proposed to give pattas to 54,000 Dalits in the Amaravati region, but Mr. Naidu and his benamis had opposed it, the MLA alleged.
 He said 1,40,000 youth belonging to the weaker sections got jobs with the establishment of village and ward secretariats.

Experienced centre-back Thiago Silva and Bayer Leverkusen forward Kai Havertz have also been tipped to join the Blues before the new season starts next month.
 Despite the added competition for places, Rudiger insists he is pleased with his side's transfer business to date.
 "I am always happy to see new faces in the team," he told Transfermarkt. "After the transfer ban last summer, we were of course hoping to get some real reinforcements.
 "With Hakim, I immediately had a good feeling and my relation to and opinion about Timo is already known.
 "With such names, the club is also sending a clear message to the existing personnel that they want to take another step forward in the overall development. I think that is great."
 Chelsea won just four of their final seven league matches and finished 33 points behind champions Liverpool, while runners-up Manchester City were 15 points better off.
 And while Rudiger is realistic about his side's targets for the new campaign, he does not expect last term's top two to continue having things all their own way.
 "What Liverpool and Man City have shown over the past few years, you have to take your hat off to them," he said. "That has my greatest respect.
 "But I don't expect these two teams to dominate everything for the next few years. Man United could move closer in the long term with consistent performances like after the corona break, and we shouldn't forget Tottenham.
 "And then there's also us, who want to close the gap step by step.
 "That will certainly be a big challenge. We don't want to set something like this as our direct target. We simply want to be even better than last season, in any case to get closer to the best teams in Europe.
 "We've already shown we can keep up with the best in single matches. What's missing is consistency throughout the season. But that is normal for our relatively young squad."
 Rudiger started 25 games for Chelsea in all competitions last season and is happy to take on more responsibility following the departure of some experienced players.
 "I feel extremely comfortable and also valued," he said. "My role has changed, especially in the last year, because we lost a few experienced players like Eden Hazard or David Luiz and a lot of young players have moved up.
 "All of a sudden, I was the player who was almost among the older ones and therefore had to take on more responsibility off the pitch as well. But I love doing that and it helps me in my development."

WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - No NBA playoff games were played on Thursday—the players were protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake, who was shot seven times by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin.Former professional tennis player Lenny Simpson, who grew up in Wilmington, remembers the civil rights movement of the 1960s very well. He believes that the NBA players are trying force change by banding together.“I definitely think they’re trying to do it as a group to show solidarity, to show unification, which I think is great,” said Simpson. “Anytime you have strength in numbers, and especially the high- profile athletes in this country, is good.”Simpson fully supports what the NBA players have done, but hopes they have a plan moving forward. “All that’s great and I love what they are doing,” said Simpson. “But you better have a final plan behind that. You better know where this is going and what you’re trying to get to in the end.”Simpson, who’s 71-years-old, says that change takes time and can be very slow. He believes things are better than when he grew up, but more needs to be done.“If you think you are oppressed now,” said Simpson. “I would like to take you back to when I grew up...how oppressed we felt as a non-citizen, as a non-person, not as a human being. So, equality has taken place, no question. But will we be ever on the same identical playing filed? I don’t know if I’ll see that in my lifetime.”The NBA is not the only league that did not play Thursday, the NHL postponed all games along with seven Major League Baseball games.Copyright 2020 WECT.

The severity of her condition made the PEARS procedure particularly complex from an anatomical perspective. Typically, the heart sits in the centre of the chest, slightly to the left of the breastbone. In Rolon's case, it was "completely displaced to the left chest cavity". "The view was very poor," Williams says. Instead of being able to operate looking down onto the heart after sawing through the sternum, they had to lift up one side of the bone and operate looking in from the side.

Canberra is open to the idea of New Zealand sending the Australian-born gunman behind the Christchurch mosque massacre back home to serve his life sentence, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday.
 White supremacist Brenton Tarrant was sentenced to life without parole on Thursday for the attacks on two mosques last year that killed 51 Muslim worshippers.
 Soon after the punishment was handed down, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said Tarrant, 29, should be transferred to the Australian prison system.
 "The Islamic community and all of New Zealand has already suffered enough without having to pay astronomical prison costs to keep him safe in our prison system," Peters said.
 Australia's Morrison said he had received no request to transfer Tarrant but he was prepared to talk about the prospect with his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern.
 "Whether he is held in Australia or New Zealand, look we're open to that discussion," he told Seven News television.
 "That obviously has a lot of implications, these sorts of decisions. The prime minister of New Zealand and I will talk about those issues."
 He said the wishes of survivors and bereaved family members would be paramount in any decision on Tarrant's future.
 "Most of all we are concerned about what the views of the families would be for those affected and we want to do the right thing by them," he said.
 Tarrant, a former gym instructor from the rural New South Wales town of Grafton, moved to New Zealand in 2017 and immediately started planning an attack on the country's Muslim community.
 Government documents show it is costing around NZ$4,900 (US$3,240) per day to keep Tarrant behind bars, compared to NZ$302 for a regular prisoner.
 The documents say he is "likely to have needs and present risk at a level of severity beyond any" managed in New Zealand before.
 Tarrant has already caused issues for prison authorities, when a letter he wrote from jail was posted on the extremist website 4Chan in August last year.
 In it, Tarrant praised British fascist Oswald Mosley and warned "there is a great conflict on the horizon".
 The Corrections Department apologised and promised it would not happen again.
 Lawyers at Tarrant's sentencing this week revealed that in a pre-sentencing interview in April he said he had renounced his racist views and felt remorse for the attacks.
 But judge Cameron Mander on Thursday rejected the gesture as "uncorroborated, self-serving and a relatively recent phenomenon", before imposing life without parole, an unprecedented sentence in New Zealand.
 Tarrant is likely to be kept in isolation for his own safety at New Zealand's only maximum-security prison in Auckland, where 80 percent of inmates are Maori or Pacific islanders.
