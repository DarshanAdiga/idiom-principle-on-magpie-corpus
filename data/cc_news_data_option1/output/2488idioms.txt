But WADA says the U.S. is “one of a small handful of countries” to have representation on the foundation board throughout the entirety of the agency's 20-year history. It said for seven of the past 14 years, a U.S. government representative has, in fact, served on the executive committee, and that the U.S. did not attend a meeting earlier this year to discuss representation for the Americas region on WADA committees. Tygart said the U.S. didn't attend the meeting because it doesn't have a sports minister, the way most countries do, and previous meetings haven't resulted in productive outcomes for the U.S. sports movement.

ROBERT TRACINSKI: Throw The Book at the Rioters. "This has been a common profile from the riots, where some of the worst violence, vandalism, and looting has been instigated by relatively well-off young people inflamed, one assumes, less by the lived experience of injustice than by radical leftist ideas. They weren’t there to cry out for reform so much as play-act at revolution. Now that these alleged vandals have been caught, they are very sorry. And, of course, there are plenty of people ready to make excuses for them. . . . This isn’t a spontaneous act of anger. It is a theory of how to achieve political change, and there is a full court press right now to get America to accept assault, looting, and arson as normal and acceptable forms of political activism."

Victor is already questioning his sexuality from the first episode, hence his correspondence with Simon, which remains strictly platonic.

And he's right, it's way cuter. Primarily because of the Salazar family — undoubtedly the show's strongest selling point even if it is suspiciously short on cultural details.

“It’s kind of tough right now to make lots of changes, or impactful changes,” Lillibridge said. “With the economy we are in, that’s one of the things that’s tough. In this ag economy, it’s going to be difficult for producers to continue these practices.”
 He said it’s going to be up to farmers to look at what practices would work on their farm financially. By going no till or strip till, a farmer might reduce labor and fuel costs.
 There are other programs that help Lillibridge make conservation profitable as well.
 Lillibridge said he is working with the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, which is providing financial incentives to farmers and landowners to help implement best management practices in terms of environmental benefits. The fund is managed by the Iowa Soybean Association and Quantified Ventures within the Agriculture Technology and Environmental Stewardship Foundation.
 He said they’ve been looking at what producers change on their farm and pay them for the outcomes.

The Georgia House of Representatives has given final passage to two health- care measures aimed at improving outcomes for new mothers and elderly Georgians.
 The House voted unanimously late Wednesday to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income mothers in Georgia and impose additional regulations on the state’s elder-care homes in the era of COVID-19.
 In both cases, the state Senate made changes to the bills, which had originated in the House earlier in this year’s legislative session, before the General Assembly took a three-month hiatus to discourage the spread of coronavirus.
 House Bill 1114 authorizes the state to apply for a federal waiver that would allow Georgia to offer Medicaid coverage to income-eligible women up to six months post-partum. The current Georgia Medicaid program only permits coverage for up to two months.
 The bill also would extend Medicaid coverage to lactation specialists for mothers having trouble feeding their babies.
 The Senate amended the bill to make the expanded coverage subject to the availability of funding for the initiative, a key consideration in light of the state’s current budget woes.
 House Bill 987 increases training requirements for staff members in elderly care facilities and raises the number of staff who would have to be on site at any given time to watch over residents. It would also increase fines for violations or if a facility causes a resident’s death.
 When the bill reached the Senate, it was amended to require elderly care homes to report when residents or staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. Senators also set out specific cleaning procedures and put in a provision requiring facilities to keep on hand at least a seven-day supply of protective equipment including masks and gowns.
 “We’re going to be a leader in this country on taking care of our elderly in assisted-living facilities,” said House Health and Human Services Committee Chairman Sharon Cooper, R-Marietta, who sponsored both bills.
 Both measures now head to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk for his signature.

WASHINGTON (AP) — NASA is naming its Washington headquarters after Mary Jackson, the space agency’s first African American female engineer whose story was portrayed in the popular film “Hidden Figures.”
 Jackson started her NASA career in 1951 as part of a segregated unit of female mathematicians at what is now Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The women did calculations during the early pre-computer days of the U.S. space program. Their story was chronicled in a book and the 2016 film.
 Jackson was later promoted to engineer and retired from NASA in 1985. She died in 2005 at age 83.
 “Mary W. Jackson was part of a group of very important women who helped NASA succeed in getting American astronauts into space, “ NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement Wednesday.
 ”Mary never accepted the status quo, she helped break barriers and open opportunities for African Americans and women in the field of engineering and technology,” he said.
 Part of the street in front of NASA headquarters is called “Hidden Figures Way" and a computer research facility at Langley is named for Katherine Johnson, another of the “Hidden Figures” mathematicians, who died in February. A NASA facility is also named for her in West Virginia, her home state.

Meanwhile, back at the pandemic . . .
 The death toll now stands at 120,000. The United States, with roughly 4 percent of the world’s population, accounts for about 25 percent of its COVID-19 deaths.
 Those states that reopened despite warnings that doing so would cause a spike in coronavirus cases are now seeing — all together now — a spike in coronavirus cases. And Donald Trump has returned to doing political rallies despite being advised by experts that large crowds are essentially a buffet table for the coronavirus. Granted, based on last week’s rally in Tulsa, large crowds are not a problem for Trump just now, but still . . .
 Oh, and let us not forget Deborah Baber, the “proud Trump Republican” who became a social-media sensation last week in defending what she calls her inalienable right not to wear a mask. Her must-see performance before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors somehow weaved in sadomasochism, terrorism and a rendition of “God Bless America” notable for its evocation of “the mountains, white with foam.”
 Baber is just one of many folks who have been filmed behaving badly — the guy who shoved his way into a Walmart is also worth a look — because they believe that in refusing to wear masks, they strike a blow for freedom. Just like John Lewis standing up to state troopers on that bridge in Selma, or that Chinese guy standing up to a tank in Tiananmen Square except, you know . . . stupid. And not really about freedom.
 Fed up with the unmasked holdouts, the Miami Herald recently ran a tartly worded editorial advising people to “just put on their damn masks.” For the record, a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in May found that most of us feel the same. Overall, 62 percent say wearing a face mask is “a matter of public health.” Yet only a bare majority — 51 percent — of Republicans agree; 42 percent of them consider masks “a matter of personal choice.”
 The World War II generation famously sacrificed for the common good in a time of common threat, going without meat, sugar, gasoline and rubber for four years. Yet some of us are whining because they’re asked to wear masks for a few months. But there’s another difference between this era and that one. Everybody back then knew exactly what they were fighting and why.
 By contrast, the fight against the coronavirus is waged in a murk of misinformation and a cloud of confusion. Is it really just the common cold? Do masks work? Did the virus originate in a Chinese lab? Will warm weather kill it? Or hydroxychloroquine? Or Lysol? Is it all Obama’s fault? Is it a hoax designed to make Trump look bad?
 Blame the murk in part on a medical community that, early on, failed to speak with one clear and consistent voice, particularly about masks. Blame it on Trump, to whom truth is always an unwelcome stranger. But blame it also on our own susceptibility, on the fact that, these days, every third voter fancies themselves Mulder or Scully, ferreting out the truth “they” don’t want you to know. The right and the left both carry that tendency, but it is far more pronounced on the right, thanks to a 24-hour electronic megaplex of half truths, untruths, and conspiracy theories that normalizes the paranoid and the utterly bizarre.
 Meanwhile, back at the pandemic, people are dying. So now would be an excellent time for some of us to yank their heads from their fundaments. Put on the damn mask, indeed. And stand 6 feet apart. And listen to the experts. After all, they don’t know who you voted for.
 And the virus doesn’t care.

As the clock wound down to six minutes and change, Illinois held a 31-28 lead when it started a drive deep in its own territory. But when Illini quarterback Johnny Johnson dropped back to pass, Oregon safety Jaiya Figueras interrupted his plans. Blitzing from the right corner of the Oregon line; Figueras stripped Johnson of the ball and recovered it in the end zone for an Oregon touchdown and a 34-31 lead. Following a missed PAT, all the Ducks had to do was hold Illinois scoreless for six minutes. Backing up the Oregon D were 44,000 voices, every one of them turned up to 11. So powerful was the collective sound — and the collective will — of the crowd that all the water vapor in the sultry air was drawn toward the Autzen bowl, forming a thin cloud that hovered just over the top of the stadium and created an acoustic blanket to amplify the din.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi legislators were under increasing pressure Thursday to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag, amid national protests over racial injustice and urging from sports leagues and leaders in business, religion and education.
 A Republican former governor, Phil Bryant, on Thursday advocated replacing the Confederate symbol with another flag design.
 “I was proud as Governor to add ‘In God We Trust’ to the State Seal," Bryant wrote on Twitter. “It will make a great Mississippi State Flag.”
 Bryant left office in January after eight years as governor and four before that as lieutenant governor — and he never pushed the politically volatile issue of changing the flag during his time in office.
 Current Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Wednesday, for the first time, that he probably would not stand in the way if legislators muster a large enough majority to change the flag.
 Mississippi is the last state with a flag that includes the emblem that many see as racist.

 Since March, America has learned that our domestic politics and our foreign policy are outdated. They might have been fine for a different time and place but now they are actually obsolete.
 During last year's primaries, which seem so long ago and far away, Democrats didn't talk much about international relations. They must have sensed that the system is broken. President Trump is eager to tear down the systems America has in place and replace it with an idiotic go-it-alone policy, which is just making a bad situation worse.
 The most pressing problem continues to be refugees and the world's unwillingness to help them, which is now compounded by the coronavirus. In refugee camps along the US-Mexican border the refugees already suffer from multiple health issues and when the pandemic strikes it will be a nightmare.
 Venezuelan refugees in Columbia, Chile and Peru are already suffering from the coronavirus. Their host countries don't want them. Venezuela is not eager for their return. An international group of nations has pledged $3 billion to help them.
 The refugee situation continues in the Mediterranean Sea with hundreds continuing to drown or languish in camps in Turkey and Libya, in India where the Hindu majority is trying to drive out Muslims, in Australia which refuses to help refugees from southeast Asia and holds them in suspension on nearby islands, and in sub-Sahara Africa where refugees from civil wars are desperately trying to find safety.
 The prospects are that the international crisis will simply continue to deteriorate without strong international leadership. Right now, except for stopgap measures, the world does nothing to help. When Trump claims he wants to help by accepting qualified Hong Kong refugees, he only makes the political situation in Hong Kong worse.
 The US and the world claim there's no money. Here's a solution and a new foreign policy in one neat little package. All the countries in the world need to do is cut their military budgets by 50% over the next five years.
 This will give every country the financial resources to fight poverty, sickness, homelessness and illiteracy at home and free up the financial resources to also fight the coronavirus. Even the richest countries in the world can't continue to fund their overly-extravagant military, help their own people and people outside their borders.
 That's the first step, every country working together through the UN and WHO. While the world is beginning to cut their military spending they will be looking to the US, the EU, Russia, India and China to make sure that these countries are following through.
 After each country has put a share of its former military funds to work helping their own people in their own countries, the rich countries should reach out and help the third world countries and instead of exploiting them economically, actually help them build sustainable economies which help their people and not enrich the bottom line of global capitalists.
 And the third piece is to enthusiastically tackle, once and for all, climate change. We have the money. No one can say we have no money. If the US spends $2 billion a day on the military, America now has $1 billion a day to spend helping their fellow Americans, the world's poor and to fight climate change. The beauty is that we can take all three ideas and come up with a grand strategy that does all three simultaneously.
 As countries work together, they'll see even less need for a large military force. And we'll all see that helping others, in the long run, benefits us all.

CHICAGO (AP) — Two brothers who have said they helped actor Jussie Smollett stage a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago last year no longer intend to cooperate with authorities, according to their attorney.
 But one legal expert said even if Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo stop cooperating it won't hurt the case because prosecutors can present at trial the brothers' previous testimony before a grand jury.
 “What they said is already under oath on paper," said David Erickson, a former state appellate judge who teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law.
 At the heart of the brothers' change of heart is a growing frustration with the refusal by authorities to return their belongings — including a gun — that was seized early last year during the police investigation that led to the “Empire" actor's arrest.
 “(The brothers) were, like ’Gloria, we’ve had it, we’ve been so patient,” their attorney, Gloria Schmidt Rodriguez told the Chicago Tribune after writing a letter to the police department's attorney. “Everything we’ve provided the office is without subpoena … Instagram messages, social media posts, phone records, whatever it is we’ve needed, and wanted, they’ve produced. That ends now. We’ve obviously been too accessible for them.”
 Schmidt even informed the police department's attorney that whether or not they get their belongings back, they are through cooperating, according to a letter obtained by the newspaper.

We are living in a moment of global chaos. Chaos does not mean the complete absence of some kind of order, but suggests a level of turbulence, fragility and contemporary geopolitical uncertainty in the face of multiple "global risks" and possible destinations.
 Unpredictability and instability become the norm. This refers not only to greater volatility in the face of threats, but also to the very dynamics of political forces and contemporary capitalism.
 The world order that emerged with the fall of the Berlin Wall and sought to expand formal democracy in the world (despite how often the major powers destabilized and interrupted it whenever they thought it was necessary) hand in hand with neoliberal globalization, in a kind of "global social- liberalism".
 A narrative of global "prosperity" and "stability" was created that confined democracy to capitalism. This strategy is now being challenged in light of the prospect that the international market can hold up well, even with authoritarian drifts, neo-fascism and constant violations of individual rights.
 If the pandemic ends up producing a geopolitical shift, it would then be necessary to discuss some of the main emerging geopolitical trends and patterns, as well as the contentious scenarios in dispute at the global level. That is the focus of this article.
 ## Neither de-globalization nor the end of capitalist globalization
 We are not facing the end of globalization and the emergence of "de- globalization", although we are possibly facing the end of capitalist globalization as we know it.
 The degree of radicalization of the territorial and financial expansion of capital during the last decades has been made possible by the creation of an agreement championed by the West – with the United States at the helm (even as its hegemony is on the decline) – which has allowed for the creation of dominant narrative of growth. This was attuned to the unlimited expansion of transnational companies and to the approval of diverse groups that hold power and national and international organizations.
 Its unfolding took place, as is well known, by removing all barriers in accordance with a grammar of deregulation, flexibilization and liberalization that secured neoliberalism’s place around the world, while destroying the environment and the social life. With it came a process of cultural struggle to entrench neoliberal globalization as a model that was not only economic but also societal.

Thomas Ferguson, 52, began harassing his ex-wife of 18-years after their marriage broke down in February.
 On Sunday, May 3, he started sending the victim, a woman in her forties, a string of messages which became offensive in nature.
 During a two-day spree, he sent 43 threatening messages to the victim and a photograph of him holding a knife up to his face.
 On May 7, Ferguson was arrested on suspicion of harassment and later bailed. However, despite conditions stipulating that he could not contact the victim, on May 17 he sent her a distressed message which suggested he wanted to harm himself.
 The victim immediately attempted to try and find him and in a subsequent phone call, he told her he had cut himself.
 The woman found Ferguson’s vehicle parked in a pub car park in Overcote Lane, Needingworth, and as she went to check on him, he lifted his arm up to show his injuries before driving off.
 The victim followed him in the car to where he stopped further down the road. When she got out to talk to him, Ferguson said “You have done this, I am going to drive into the house” before making off at speed.
 When the victim drove to her home in Needingworth she found Ferguson had driven into the property, causing extensive damaged and making it unliveable.
 Police were alerted and Ferguson, of the Furlongs, Needingworth, was arrested at the scene.
 He admitted charges of dangerous driving, criminal damage and stalking and was sentenced to 40 months in prison at Peterborough Crown Court today (June 25).
 He was also handed an indefinite restraining order and his disqualification from driving for two years, extended by 19 months.
 DC Neil Patrick said: “Ferguson put both himself and those around him in extreme danger and it’s sheer luck that no one was seriously injured as a result of him driving into the property.
 “His rampage caused the victim huge amounts of distress, leaving her home severely damaged.
 “I hope this sentence gives the victim some measure of comfort and closure and Ferguson has time to reflect on his actions.”

HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. (AP) — An engineer error caused a CSX freight train to derail as it crossed the Potomac River near Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, sending two cars into the water and damaging a footbridge that is part of the Appalachian Trail, according to a report from the Federal Railroad Administration.
 Seven empty train cars in total derailed in the December 21 incident and no one was injured.
 The recently released report said the engineer used excessive force to make a movement with the brakes still applied, The Journal reported.
 The derailment closed access to some parts of Harpers Ferry National Historic Park and the Chesapeake & Ohio National Historic Park.
 Repairs to the footbridge are underway and are expected to be completed in late July.

Belgian right back Thomas Meunier has signed a four-year deal with Borussia Dortmund and will join the club on a free transfer when his current contract with Paris St Germain expires this month, the German Bundesliga club says.
 The Ligue 1 season was ended in April amid the COVID-19 crisis and Meunier, whose contract expires on June 30, declined to sign a short-term extension that would allow him to play domestic cup finals and the remainder of the Champions League with PSG.
 "Borussia Dortmund play exactly the type of football I want to play: exciting, authentic and natural," Meunier, who will link up with Belgium teammates Axel Witsel and Thorgan Hazard at Dortmund, said in a statement on the club's website.
 "I am ambitious and I want to win titles with Dortmund, as I have done in Brugge and Paris."
 The 28-year-old won three Ligue 1 titles during his four-year spell with PSG after joining the French champions from Club Brugge in 2016.

It wouldn't be a teen romance without a little cheese, and "Love, Victor" has that in spades. The show is laughably tame, especially in a TV landscape that includes "Sex Education" and "Euphoria," two shows that feature radically progressive depictions of teenage sexuality. It will probably play better with older kids than actual teenagers, but a fair amount of adults will enjoy escaping into its sweet candy-coated fluff. The episodic format works better for this PG tone, anyway. "Love, Simon" may have been first, but if "Love, Victor" is any indication, it won't be the last.

The GAO also recommended that the IRS "should consider cost-effective options for notifying ineligible recipients how to return payments." The IRS agreed with this recommendation in a response to the GAO.
 The IRS has previously said that stimulus payments issued in the name of dead people have to be returned. But aside from announcing on its website on May 6 that stimulus payments made to dead or incarcerated individuals should be returned, the IRS does not currently have plans to take additional steps toward recouping the payments, GAO said.
 The report makes clear how, in the mad dash to pass legislation to prop up an economy in free-fall in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, mistakes were made.
 The Cares Act directed the stimulus payments to people who filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return. The payments went to people making up to $99,000 annually. According to GAO, IRS officials raised questions with Treasury as the Cares Act was being drafted about the possibility that payments could go to people who filed tax returns but subsequently died. However, IRS counsel determined they did not have the legal authority to deny payments to people who had filed a return, even if they were deceased at the time of payment.
 Also, Treasury officials noted that the Cares Act mandated delivery of the economic impact payments "as rapidly as possible." To fulfill this mandate, they used procedures that had been put in place for stimulus payments issued in 2008, and as a result did not use death records as a filter. GAO noted that in 2013 it had identified weaknesses in IRS procedures that allowed payments to go to dead people, and had recommended corrective action. IRS subsequently implemented a process to use death records to update taxpayers' accounts to identify and prevent improper payments.
 But this control was bypassed for the stimulus checks issued under the Cares Act, which "substantially increased the risk of potentially making improper payments to decedents," the GAO said. It also said that according to a Treasury official from the Office of Tax Policy, Treasury had been unaware that payments might go to dead people. Upon learning this was happening in the initial batches of payments, Treasury and its Bureau of the Fiscal Service took steps to prevent the practice, obtaining temporary access to Social Security death data from the IRS.

“In other words, water quality, carbon credits, those kinds of things,” Lillibridge said. “I think that’s got a lot of legs to it.”
 Some of those economic impacts comes from coronavirus, which has affected conservation as well, said Ben Gleason, sustainable program manager with the Iowa Corn Growers Association. He said the major impacts have been the limited amount of informational field days for farmers to attend where they would learn more about the implementation of certain practices.
 He said a lot of organizations have been partnering to bring in more funding for farmers looking to get involved with applications, and Gleason is proud of the fact that they don’t have any issues spending that money.
 “We have more applications for cost share funding than we have funding,” he said. “We have farmers lined up and don’t have a problem spending that money … at least for the time being.”
 Lillibridge said a lot of the work can be done at home, just by educating yourself and talking to manufacturers and people at the co-op.
 “There’s all kinds of places that you can go, but the best thing to do is to talk with other farmers about what you are doing,” he said. “Another farmer can tell you ‘this works and this didn’t,’ whereas a manufacturer is just going to tell you ‘this thing works.’ Talking to other producers is the best way.”
 For any practice someone is interested in introducing, Lillibridge encouraged farmers to not over-extend themselves. He suggested trying a little bit at a time and see what works or does not work for a field. Going 100% invested into a practice could potentially backfire, but he also preaches patience as these practices can take time.
 “When I started strip tilling, I convinced myself that I'm going to do this for five years. And if I can't make it work in five years, then I'm going to go back to the old way,” he said. “And after the second year of doing strip till I was very frustrated, I was ready to give up. The third year, the fourth year and the fifth year were the turning point and now I’ve been strip tilling for 14 years.”

WELLINGTON -- Breonna Nelson-Hicks stood by the side of the road Monday morning with her friend, Madison Charette. Decked in tiaras, the pair looked down the street as the first car came toward them.
   
 "You belong on my school bus," the sign read. The man behind the wheel drives the bus Breonna takes to Palm Beach Central High School.
   
 Confrontation in Florida highlights racial tensions, prompts calls for change | Video,
   
 Shocked, Breonna yelled, "That's my bus driver!"
   
 Like roughly three dozen others, the man showed his support for a teen who has been catapulted into the international spotlight after a video went viral showing Breonna, Madison and another friend being yelled at by a neighbor.
   
 The video has sparked a conversation about race and acceptance in Wellington, where Breonna lives with her grandparents in the gated community of Grand Isles.
   
 In the video taken June 14 in front of Breonna's house by Madison, 60-year-old Lee Jeffers -- who lives on the street from the Nelson family -- is seen telling Breonna, who is Black, first, "You don't belong in this development," and later, "You do not deserve to be in here."
   
 Breonna was walking with Madison and another friend -- both of whom are white -- after they said Jeffers began following them. The teens had been riding on a golf cart driven by a teen boy, with another teen boy riding in the front seat. When they realized Jeffers was following them, the boys ran, leaving the girls to walk to Breonna's house.
   
 Jeffers continued to follow the teens, they said, leading to the incident in the Nelsons' driveway.
   
 Breonna, who attends Palm Beach Central High School in Wellington, said she was surprised by the offer to have the parade. It was set up by Aimee Stern, a local community organizer who runs the popular Facebook group Mom's Club of Wellington FL.
   
 "I'm extremely proud of who Breonna is, and I think she's an exemplary young woman who handled herself with grace and integrity," Stern said.
   
 About three dozen cars filed past the Nelson home Monday morning, with many drivers honking and waving signs of support for Breonna. Those in the vehicles also handed flowers, provided by Stern, to the teens.
   
 The road on which the Nelsons live ends in a cul de sac, meaning each car also had to file past Jeffers home. The Palm Beach Post has attempted to contact Jeffers, but those efforts have been unsuccessful.
   
 Healing by example
   
 It's been a rocky week for Breonna and her family since the video went viral.
   
 Her grandfather, Tony Nelson, can be seen in the video coming out of the house to step between Jeffers and the teens. He has fielded dozens of phone calls from people around the world seeking comment from him.
   
 Monday morning, he said he was "shocked" by the turnout for the parade.
   
 "I think people genuinely just wanted to let Breonna and Madison know that people love them," he said.
   
 Those who know Breonna and the Nelson family have been "genuinely hurting for her," he said.
   
 But Nelson said he hopes that hurt extends to Jeffers, who has been under fire following the confrontation.
   
 Jeffers is an analyst for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency confirmed last week. When the video went viral, Nelson was contacted by Joseph Edlow, deputy director of policy for USCIS.
   
 In a text message to Edlow shared with The Post, Nelson told Edlow he did not want Jeffers to lose his job. The families are setting up a time for Jeffers to apologize, he said.
   
 "Should Mr. Jeffers continue with his promises, he can help heal this country by example," Nelson said.
   
 A community commitment takes shape
   
 Nelson and Jeffers met last week, the first step in a journey toward forgiveness, Nelson said. They were joined by two pastors from Christ Fellowship Church's Royal Palm Beach campus, as well as Mayor Anne Gerwig, who led the group in prayer, Nelson said.
   
 The Friday before the incident, Nelson had talked with Village Manager Paul Schofield about getting more involved in Wellington, helping with programs to reach out to underprivileged and disadvantaged youth.
   
 Part of that is an internship program the village has run for several years. Nelson talked with Community Services Director Paulette Edwards, Human Resources Director Kim Gibbons and General Services Director Ed De La Vega. Nelson is chief operating officer of Premier Family Health, which has committed to taking on an intern as part of the program.
   
 Jeffers also committed to becoming involved in the internship program, Nelson said.
   
 In addition to the cars who filed along their street Monday morning, several neighbors stepped outside to show support.
   
 Robert and Shari Markowitz moved into Grand Isles 21 years ago. They own Lutina's Pizza and Subs in Wellington.
   
 The incident captured on the video does not reflect the neighborhood they know so well, Robert Markowitz said.
   
 "We have great families in here," he said.
   
 Initially, Breonna did not want to speak to reporters. But she changed her mind because, she said, the issue is bigger than her.
   
 Breonna was bullied about six months ago because of her skin color, her mother, Shannon Nelson said. In a group text, several other teens had called Breonna a racial slur.
   
 When she first heard about the June 14 incident and saw the video, Shannon Nelson, who works for Calvary Chapel in Fort Lauderdale, said she needed to make sure her daughter was taking time to process what happened.
   
 "Her heart was my main concern," Shannon Nelson said.
   
 Breonna said she is happy about Jeffers' willingness to apologize and work with Nelson to begin to make amends.
   
 "I wanted to show it for all of the girls who have been in my situation," Breonna said, adding, "We're going to make this negative situation into a positive one."
   
 That's a sentiment echoed by Tony Nelson, who said he wants to make sure any change he's part of in Wellington will last.
   
 "Let's not lose focus that this is not just about Breonna, Madison and my family," he said. "I truly feel that we can make a difference."
   
 He hopes everyone in Wellington will get involved.
   
 "Because I know that's what Wellington is," Nelson said.

While the U.S. government accounts for 7.2% of WADA's annual budget, it currently has no seats on the 12-person executive committee, which guides policy discussions. And of the 59 available positions on WADA's six key policy-making panels, the U.S. holds one seat, which belongs to former sprinter Lauryn Williams, who is not a government representative. (Edwin Moses was a longtime chair of the Education Committee, but his tenure ended last year.) The government has one seat on WADA's 39-person foundation board, which mainly serves to rubber-stamp policies hashed out in the executive committee.

Since March, America has learned that our domestic politics and our foreign policy are outdated. They might have been fine for a different time and place but now they are actually obsolete.
   
 During last year's primaries, which seem so long ago and far away, Democrats didn't talk much about international relations. They must have sensed that the system is broken. President Trump is eager to tear down the systems America has in place and replace it with an idiotic go-it-alone policy, which is just making a bad situation worse.
   
 The most pressing problem continues to be refugees and the world's unwillingness to help them, which is now compounded by the coronavirus. In refugee camps along the US-Mexican border the refugees already suffer from multiple health issues and when the pandemic strikes it will be a nightmare.
   
 Venezuelan refugees in Columbia, Chile and Peru are already suffering from the coronavirus. Their host countries don't want them. Venezuela is not eager for their return. An international group of nations has pledged $3 billion to help them.
   
 The refugee situation continues in the Mediterranean Sea with hundreds continuing to drown or languish in camps in Turkey and Libya, in India where the Hindu majority is trying to drive out Muslims, in Australia which refuses to help refugees from southeast Asia and holds them in suspension on nearby islands, and in sub-Sahara Africa where refugees from civil wars are desperately trying to find safety.
   
 The prospects are that the international crisis will simply continue to deteriorate without strong international leadership. Right now, except for stopgap measures, the world does nothing to help. When Trump claims he wants to help by accepting qualified Hong Kong refugees, he only makes the political situation in Hong Kong worse.
   
 The US and the world claim there's no money. Here's a solution and a new foreign policy in one neat little package. All the countries in the world need to do is cut their military budgets by 50% over the next five years.
   
 This will give every country the financial resources to fight poverty, sickness, homelessness and illiteracy at home and free up the financial resources to also fight the coronavirus. Even the richest countries in the world can't continue to fund their overly-extravagant military, help their own people and people outside their borders.
   
 That's the first step, every country working together through the UN and WHO. While the world is beginning to cut their military spending they will be looking to the US, the EU, Russia, India and China to make sure that these countries are following through.
   
 After each country has put a share of its former military funds to work helping their own people in their own countries, the rich countries should reach out and help the third world countries and instead of exploiting them economically, actually help them build sustainable economies which help their people and not enrich the bottom line of global capitalists.
   
 And the third piece is to enthusiastically tackle, once and for all, climate change. We have the money. No one can say we have no money. If the US spends $2 billion a day on the military, America now has $1 billion a day to spend helping their fellow Americans, the world's poor and to fight climate change. The beauty is that we can take all three ideas and come up with a grand strategy that does all three simultaneously.
   
 As countries work together, they'll see even less need for a large military force. And we'll all see that helping others, in the long run, benefits us all.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A city council member in suburban Phoenix is drawing criticism from the governor and others after invoking George Floyd's dying words of “I can't breathe” during a protest over an order to wear masks to stop the spread of coronavirus.
 Scottsdale Councilman Guy Phillips uttered the remark at a protest Wednesday but later insisted the comment was about mandatory masks and not police misconduct.
 The words were the last said by Floyd, who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed and lying on the ground. His death prompted worldwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.
 “Just flat out wrong. Despicable doesn’t go far enough. The final words of George Floyd should NEVER be invoked like this. Anyone who mocks the murder of a fellow human has no place in public office. Period,” Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said in a Twitter post.
 Phillips told The Arizona Republic in a text that the comment had no connection to Floyd.
 “He didn’t deserve what happened to him and I by no means was trying to make light of it by saying I can't breathe in a mask," he said to Floyd's family in a separate apology.

Regardless of how brilliant you are, you can never be successful all by yourself. Take stock of what your priorities are and then go about identifying resources that can help you. Focus on people you know who have the competence you require and implement a plan whereby you can actively reconnect with them. Also, look out for people who are influential and try to link up with them. According to inc.com, an established relationship can help you to distinguish yourself from the competition.

A letter to Trudeau signed by 19 former Canadian politicians and diplomats urges that Meng be freed in a bid to win the release of the detained Canadians. Signatories to the letter include former ministers in Trudeau's Liberal party as well as former Conservative minister Lawrence Cannon.
 “I deeply disagree with them,” Trudeau said. “We cannot allow political pressures or random arrests of Canadian citizens to influence the functioning of our justice system. So I respect these individuals, but they’re wrong.”
 Meng is facing fraud charges in the United States but denies the allegations that she misrepresented the company’s relationship with Skycom Tech, putting the HSBC banking company at risk of violating sanctions in Iran. Hearings in the extradition case have been adjourned until Aug. 17.
 “Canada has an independent judiciary, and those processes will unfold independently of any political pressure, including by foreign governments,” Trudeau said.
 Meng is free on bail, living in her Vancouver mansion. Kovrig and Spavor are jailed, and Canadian diplomats have been refused consular access to them since January.

“I asked Dr. Bertman, ‘What’s all this extra digging that I’m not used to?’” said Mr. Famularo, 51.
 His teeth, he said, now feel “squeaky clean.”
 But should patients take the risk? When surveyed by The Times, many epidemiologists have said they were comfortable returning to their doctors. Health specialists said neglecting routine dental care was unwise. Some also noted that it is the dentists and hygienists who are more at risk of getting sick since they are the ones on the receiving end of any aerosol droplets that could contain the virus.
 “All that drilling and suctioning, it’s the provider, it’s not the patient, getting aerosolized secretions,” said Laurie Anne Ferguson, dean of the College of Nursing and Health at Loyola University New Orleans and a nurse practitioner.
 The American Dental Association has made a series of recommendations including advising patients to wear a face covering when they come in, having them wait outside or in their car until the dentist is ready to see them, removing magazines and toys from the waiting area, and placing hand sanitizer throughout the office.
 Getting the first appointment of the day may also limit risk, though many dentists said they are seeing fewer patients so they have more time to disinfect rooms between visits.
 Still, other health experts, including dentists, said they were skeptical about going to the dentist for anything that is not urgent, like an abscess, especially in the many parts of the country where coronavirus cases are rising.
 “For everything that we’re doing, we need to ask if it’s really necessary,” said Peter Jüni, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto and St. Michael’s Hospital. “We want to make sure we don’t contribute to transmission.”
 Dr. Neetu Singh, the oral health program director at Health Care For All in Boston, said for now people should use telehealth or call the dentist first for a consultation, then assess whether to come in.
 “A remote conversation is probably the wiser step to take at this juncture,” she said.

 But Professor Ferguson said her experience treating patients during the pandemic had made her feel reasonably secure visiting the dentist.
 If a dentist is taking proper steps, like wearing protective gear and seeing fewer patients, people should feel confident, she said.

In software we’ve achieved five-star crash-test simulations, even on the side pole impact test, which is really tough for a battery vehicle. Then we are showing a prototype this week. We’ll do betas at the end of this year, and then we’ll start crashing those betas in real life and simultaneously while we’re doing all that we are preparing the factory. To be able to build them once we get the green light from the crash test. So both those initiatives are happening in parallel—getting the factory ready, getting all the tooling ready, and then getting the vehicle certified.

Victor is already questioning his sexuality from the first episode, hence his correspondence with Simon, which remains strictly platonic. However, as Victor writes Simon, his Colombian-American family is _different_ than Simon's. The first episode ends with Victor's very on the nose reminder: "My story is nothing like yours." And he's right, it's way cuter. Primarily because of the Salazar family -- undoubtedly the show's strongest selling point even if it _is_ suspiciously short on cultural details. (We learn Victor's grandparents are from Colombia very briefly in the fifth episode.)

VINTON, Iowa — When thinking about his future and eventually retirement, Lance Lillibridge knows he needs to protect his assets. That’s why he’s adamant about making sure he is conserving every last bit of his farm if possible.
 “I like to tell everyone that I don’t have a 401K, this is it. That dirt out here — that’s my 401K,” Lillibridge said. “If we don’t manage it correctly, there won’t be anything left. We have to take care of it.”
 The Benton County, Iowa, farmer said one of the major challenges in recent years has been the downturn on commodity prices. That has made a lot of farmers take a hard look at the bottom line, which might leave some conservation tactics out of the plan.
