Historically, real estate investment trusts may not always move in tandem with the broader stock market because of the time difference between the real estate cycle and the business cycle. The expansion phase of a typical business cycle lasts just under five years, while the real estate cycle runs for about 18 years. These cyclical differences could contribute to lower correlations to the broad stock market.  
 When the economy picked up steam in the mid-2010s, it helped lend support to the real estate market. Demand for apartments started to rise as home prices went up, giving landlords pricing power to raise rents. Rental prices began rising more quickly as economic growth picked up, according to Zillow.
 ## High Correlation to Interest Rates
 The rate hike cycle that began in 2015 might appear negative for REITs, as rising rates can mean higher borrowing costs. But even after a number of rate hikes between 2015 and 2018, borrowing costs remained relatively low by historical standards. Besides, although rising interest rates have the potential to make home-buying more expensive, they also could boost demand for rentals, potentially helping real estate sector stocks.
 However, all that said, the real estate sector struggled in its early years as an S&P sector, rising more slowly than the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX). That could be partly because of rising interest rates in the late 2010s that weighed on the real estate industry.
 Despite the sector’s relatively slow start, everyone still needs shelter, whether it’s your home, office, or when you visit the local indoor shopping mall. In addition, many investors seek diversity in their portfolios. That combination isn’t going away anytime soon, making the real estate sector, and perhaps real estate investment trusts, one that you might want to learn more about.
  _Investments in REITs and other real estate securities are subject to the same risks as direct investments in real estate, including loss of principal. The real estate industry is particularly sensitive to economic downturns. Be sure to consider your own financial situation, perform thorough research and consult with a qualified tax professional before making any investment decisions concerning REITs_.

Vision Zero has missed the mark, and by a long shot. If we are being completely honest, Vision Zero has epitomized the phrase "all talk and no action." It is quite literally a marketing campaign. Slick commercials and billboards will not fundamentally alter the fact that our city's roads are designed to support speeding cars while disenctivizing mass transit, cyclists and those who merely want to meander. We've largely avoided the hard work of roadway redesigns because it requires a reprioritization of public space away from drivers, who are a powerful constituency. But these are conversations that we must have.

Although they are brothers, Fuches Lewis II and Langston Lewis have contrasting styles on and off the football field.
   
 Fuches is a 6-foot-3, 290-pound senior lineman who plays for Calvary Day School, while younger brother Langston is a 6-foot, 180-pound junior receiver and defensive back at Islands High.
   
 And their dispositions are just as different as their bodies, their mother, Evanita Wallace-Lewis, says.
   
 "Fuches is more of the silent killer," said Wallace-Lewis, the principal at Shuman Elementary School. "He's quiet and focused on getting the job done without any trash talking. But Langston is more boisterous and external. He is going to get in your face with his celebrations when he makes a big play."
            
 The brothers are best of friends -- and they are connected by a competitive spirit passed down from their father, Fuches Lewis Sr., a former standout at Savannah High who went on to play at Savannah State, and their uncle, the late Mede Lewis, who also starred in his prep days as a Blue Jacket.
   
 "That's their common trait -- that drive to compete," Wallace-Lewis said. "They have always loved sports and they mirror that competitive nature that their father has."
   
 Fuches Lewis II, who committed to play football at Georgia State in July, recently returned from a knee injury and has had an immediate impact on both sides of the line for Calvary Day, which is getting ready to make a playoff push.
   
 "I'm proud of my brother and where we both are today," said Fuches Lewis II, who also competes in discus and shot put in track and field. "I love when I get a chance to see Langston play. If there is a 50/50 ball that you need to jump up and get, I know he is going to go up and get it.
   
 "It really shows how hard we both have worked and we are both grateful for everything our parents have done. My dad has been a big influence with football, and I wouldn't be the player I am today without him. He has shown me what I'm built for and what I'm capable of.
   
 "And my mom is always telling us how important grades are. She says, 'Football isn't always going to be there, but a college degree always will be.' "
   
 Langston, who doubles as a standout center fielder and shortstop on the Islands baseball team, said he has always looked up to his brother and respects the way he approaches the game.
   
 "He likes to work hard and that motivates me to work hard myself," Langston said. "I want to keep getting better so I can get to his level and get a college scholarship."
   
 Through six games, Langston had 13 catches for 173 yards and five scores for Islands, which will host the first home playoff game in school history on Nov. 27.
   
 "I feel like I've improved with every aspect of my game," Langston said. "I'm stronger, faster and I'm running better routes. As a team, I feel like if we play to our potential and focus on the big picture of the playoffs we can make a deep run."
   
 The brothers attend each other's games whenever they get the chance. When the boys have games on the same nights, mom and dad split things up.
   
 Evanita Wallace-Lewis said they have a system to see who will go to which game. Her husband was more precise in detailing how they plan things.
   
 "The system is she tells me which game she wants to go to, and I go to the opposite game," Lewis Sr. said with a laugh. "So the system works well."
   
 Family history
   
 Lewis Sr. said the physical differences in his sons are similar to the ones he had with his brother Mede, who was known as Speedy Mede for his exploits as a running back at Savannah High, where he won the Mike Finocchiaro Award as the top player in Savannah in 1993. Mede Lewis died in 2009 from cardiac arrest at the age of 32.
   
 "Me and my brother were very similar to Fuches and Langston," Lewis Sr. said. "I was a big lineman and my brother could run. So now it's super cool to have one kid (Fuches) who emulates me in a way, while Langston is a little more athletic like his uncle. They are following in our footsteps and I'm very proud of both of them."
   
 He said he first saw the potential of Fuches II as a middle schooler playing in the FSG Future Stars game pitting the best young players from Georgia against Florida's best.
   
 "I saw it then, and the way he competed sparked his future. He started asking about what he needed to do to play Division I ball, and he's worked so hard to get there.
   
 "Langston was more of a late bloomer; he really grew into his athleticism," Lewis Sr. said. "In middle school he started to blossom. He just loves any sport with a ball. If you talk to him long enough, he'll convince you that he can play lacrosse."
   
 He said the boys have a healthy sibling rivalry going, but he and his wife work to keep them grounded.
   
 "It's been tough having to split up the games. It's hard to be two places at once, but we're not complaining," Lewis Sr. said. "We're very proud of what our boys are doing."

These and other acronyms are arguably worth getting to know as FAANGs lose a bit of the influence they held a few years ago. Privacy issues, government investigations into accusations of antitrust violations, and growing competition dogged some of the FAANGs in 2019. It also means they were responding to different issues, rather than trading like one big group. This makes it harder to see them as a one-track story driving the market.
 As FAANGs fell in late 2018, investors could get a sense of exactly where people were running for cover not by following broad sectors like Consumer Staples or Utilities, but instead by focusing on a very small handful of stocks that seemed to weather the storm quite well.
 This tiny basket of stocks, which unfortunately lacks a clever acronym, might be thought of as “Shave and a Soda,” and consists of CocaCola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Procter & Gamble (PG).
 “One of the most surprising things about last year’s Q4 collapse was the strength of PEP, KO, and PG,” said JJ Kinahan, Chief Market Strategist, TD Ameritrade. “These stocks continued to perform pretty well in bad markets. The FAANG stocks play was clearly over, but the new hideout became PEP, KO, and PG.
 “People were looking to blue-chip, steady stocks if they didn’t want to go to bonds,” Kinahan continued. “Old-school stocks are what people want in times of uncertainty, and these three have stable products and pay dividends.”
 During that rocky quarter, PEP and KO shares were roughly steady, while PG actually rose 10%. The SPX fell 20% between late September and late December.
 Now let’s take a look at some other popular baskets.
 ## Watch WATCH
 You could track U.S. consumer health by keeping an eye on the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary or Consumer Staples sectors, but those are really wide. They include lots of companies that might be doing a great job, but don’t necessarily reflect the core of the U.S. consumer and what they’re doing.
 That’s why more analysts lately are talking about WATCH. It stands for Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Home Depot (HD). Sure, this index leaves out a lot of big players, but the group of five—perhaps the retail equivalent of the FAANG stocks—is now one many investors well, “watch” closely.
 In 2019, these names started to look like outperformers compared to some legacy retailers, particularly those in the department store and casual fashion sectors. It seems like more people are buying their clothes on those shopping trips to the grocery store or over the Internet rather than heading to the mall.
 The five stocks—WMT, AMZN, TGT, COST, HD—are all big-box, mostly discount retailers, and go head-to-head to compete for what the industry refers to as “share of wallet.” Between the five, you’re talking more than $1 trillion in annual revenue, so it’s probably fair to say that incorporates a big chunk of overall U.S. consumer spending on everything from Christmas gifts to groceries to clothing to household items like washing machines and televisions.
 This doesn’t mean the five stocks always trade right in sync. As the chart below shows, WMT has been by far the strongest over the last two years, though all are up pretty solidly. It’s also clear from the chart that in last year’s Q4, when economic worries flashed, all five lost a lot of ground.
 Consumer sentiment means a lot for retailers, so looking at the performance of WATCH, like following the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence reports, could give you another perspective on how the consumer is doing. Remember, consumer spending drives about 70% of the U.S. economy.

New cameras are being installed at a notorious city centre junction where drivers routinely ignore 'no right turn' signs.
 Salford council has put forward plans for a new traffic order at the junction of Chapel Street and Victoria Bridge Street.
 It has been illegal to make a right turn for several years but signs are ignored by thousands of drivers every week.
 In 2013, the M.E.N highlighted the issue after we observed 50 cars making the turn in just half an hour.
 Seven years later, traffic gridlock around Manchester city centre remains a problem, particularly on routes heading towards Salford and Trafford at rush- hour.
 Drivers using Deansgate to cut across town has been a historic problem, and a move to temporarily pedestrianise a short section of the road in response to the pandemic was welcomed by many earlier this year.
 Manchester council has also expressed support for permanently pedestrianising most of Deansgate in the long term, although the routing of buses coming in and out from Salford remains an issue to be resolved.
 Now Salford Council has made an order, to be introduced 'on an experimental basis for a period of up to 18 months', that aims to gain further control of driver behaviour in the Chapel Street area.

A decade or two ago, you could keep tabs on market performance and investor sentiment just by tracking a few major indices and maybe some S&P 500 sectors. That might not be good enough any more.
 Over the last couple of years, focus shifted away from the forest and toward the trees. An emerging handful of smaller stock baskets that include some of the most closely-watched corporate names can arguably help serve as barometers for market, investor and economic sentiment better than the clunky big indices.
 Luckily, the new baskets have catchy names that make them easy to remember.
 One of them, of course, is the “FAANG” group. Unless you’ve been hibernating since around 2012, you’ve probably heard of this well-known basket of stocks. It consists of Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOGL).
 FAANG became a watchword in the mid-2010s as Technology shares ran up huge gains to outpace most of the market. These five stocks had so much influence (with 28% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization at the end of 2018, according to Forbes) that analysts coined the “FAANG” name for them, and the New York Stock Exchange even has a “FAANG” index you can track.
 On a lot of days back in the 2016-2018 period, you could get a better sense of how the market was doing by looking at those five stocks than arguably any other way. Where they went, the market often followed.
 It’s not the first time that baskets of influential stocks stepped onto center stage. Older investors probably remember the so-called “Nifty-50” names of the 1960s and 1970s. The difference is that today’s baskets are even smaller and arguably allow investors to really hone in on sentiment.
 For instance, when the markets dramatically plunged in late 2018, FAANGs led the way down as investors quickly shed positions in those formerly high-flying five stocks. Weakness in the FAANGs arguably had an outsized influence as the S&P 500 (SPX) fell nearly 20% by Christmas Eve.
