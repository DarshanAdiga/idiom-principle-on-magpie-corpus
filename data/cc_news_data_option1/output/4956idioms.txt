The image "Next Generation" is a perfect example. One could crop the left and right sides of the image to the point where only a thin sliver of the centre remained. Squeezing out everything except the twins taking centre stage in the image. But in the process, one can lose the structural details that bestow it with a sense of place. Details such as dappled sunlight strolling through the partially shaded forest. Wrinkled tree trunks sporting ages capable of outlasting many generations. A verdant meadow brimming with macro opportunities. Ambitious mountain tops sporting spectacular bird-eye views. And a bluer than blue sky primed and waiting for an unobstructed milky way to circle above the horizon.

4) Pay attention to detail: One of my favorite military exercises was night navigation. This required very little training and one simple tool- a compass. The exercise consists of throwing you in a dark open field with few coordinates that if done correctly will lead you to your final destination. Easy enough, right? Well, what they don’t tell you is all the obstacles you get to encounter along the way like barbed wire fences, rivers, thick forest, you name it. All and any of these obstacles can easily throw you off if you are not paying close attention to detail. Keeping track of every step you take and following your compass will lead you in the right direction. Not paying attention to details, in both the military and in business, will definitely take you on the wrong path.

Palo Alto's recent decision to expand access to Foothills Park by welcoming nonresidents to the exclusive nature preserve is facing a challenge from a group of residents who are hoping to reverse it through a referendum.
 If the referendum effort succeeds, the City Council would have to cancel its plan to open Foothills Park to nonresidents on Dec. 17. It would also likely revive the lawsuit against the city by a coalition that includes the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and residents from Palo Alto and neighboring cities over the exclusive nature of the 1,400-acre preserve where admission is currently limited to Palo Alto residents and their guests.
 In challenging the 1965 law that restricts Foothills Park access, the plaintiff coalition has argued that it violates several fundamental rights of nonresidents, including the right to travel, the right to free speech and their right to free assembly. The Sept. 15 lawsuit also argues that the law "traces its roots to an era when racial discrimination in and around the City was open and notorious," citing the prevalence of blockbusting, redlining and racially restrictive covenants in home deeds.
 Because these policies have kept many Black residents from purchasing homes in Palo Alto, the law on Foothills Park access "traces its roots to an era when racial discrimination in and around the City was open and notorious."
 "The Ordinance perpetuates this historic exclusion and violates the constitutional rights of individuals who are not Palo Alto residents," the lawsuit states. "It bars non-residents from entering a public park that occupies nearly 10% of the land in Palo Alto. And it transforms this vast space into a preserve for the fortunate few: for people who were not systematically denied the right to reside in the City during the era of outright racial exclusion, and people who are wealthy enough to afford to move into the City today, as it has become one of the five most expensive places to live in the United States."
 The council was preparing to gradually expand access to the preserve even before the lawsuit, though council members were planning to do it on a more limited and gradual basis. In August, the council approved a pilot program that would allow nonresidents to buy up to 50 permits per day to visit Foothills Park. The council also specified at that time that it intended to send the issue of nonresident access to the voters in November 2022.
 But faced with the lawsuit, the council voted 5-2 on Nov. 2 to follow the advice of City Manager Ed Shikada and City Attorney Molly Stump and strike the ban on nonresidents from the municipal code. The council also agreed to limit park access to 750 visitors at any one time for the first 90 days (after that, the limit would revert to the current level of 1,000 visitors). Council members Lydia Kou and Greg Tanaka both dissented, with Kou arguing that the lawsuit "circumvents the democratic process."
 Now, Kou is supporting a citizen effort to overturn the action of the council majority. On Nov. 26, she sent out a mass email informing her supporters of the referendum drive and urging them to get involved.
 Much like Kou had argued at the Nov. 2 meeting, supporters of the referendum are alleging that because the council made its decision to settle in a closed session, the council should suspend the policy change until a public vote.
 Irina Beylin, who is gathering signatures for the referendum, told this news organization that she does not oppose Foothills Park to nonresidents. She said she supported the council's initial proposal for a one-year pilot program with limited nonresident permits and careful evaluation of impacts on the nature preserve.
 She strongly objected, however, to the council's Nov. 2 decision to scrap the provision based on a lawsuit. This, she said, creates a "slippery slope" in which other outside groups can pressure the city with lawsuits to overturn policies favored by the public.
 She noted that even if the signature-gathering effort succeeds, it doesn't mean that the city will have to wait until November 2022 to welcome nonresidents. The council, she said, can simply revert to the pilot program that the council had initially approved through a public process.
 "We have to do it openly and transparently. Nothing behind closed doors," Beylin told this publication.
 The referendum petition similarly frames the issue as one transparency.
 "The democratic process should be followed," the referendum petition states. "The current changes to Foothills Park Ordinance were approved by City Council behind closed doors without input from the public. The measure to open Foothills Park to General Public should be put on the ballot and details should be openly discussed with constituents."
 As of Monday afternoon, proponents of the referendum have already gathered a "few hundred" signatures, Beylin said. They need to get more than 2,500 by the Dec. 16 deadline to force a referendum. With the pandemic raging across the nation and Santa Clara County recently adding new restrictions to contain the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, she knows the signature-gathering effort remains an uphill climb, particularly since local law requires all signatures to be gathered by hand. But she believes that if the council rescinds its Nov. 2 policy and instead moves ahead with a more gradual pilot program, it will have the added benefit of securing buy-in from more residents.
 "When people see that the pilot program works, I'm positive that it would be overwhelmingly supported by Palo Alto residents to open the park, with certain conditions," Beylin said.

Without a doubt, my military experience helped shape who I am and how I lead in business. It taught me the value and power of showing up. I know it sounds simple, but in this day in age, showing up and being present in business is how you win customers, it’s how you build trust with employees, and it’s how you model leadership. If you do not show up in the Army, you are putting your fellow soldiers at risk and possibly in harm’s way, and that’s not something anyone wants to carry around. Showing up is often done in small gestures and can be as simple as being punctual or following through when you tell a customer you’ll send them something. I encourage everyone to think about ways they can “show up” for their customers and employees. In the end, it goes a long way.

 # No surprises, Tigers offer contracts to all 9 arbitration-eligible players
 Chris McCosky
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 _Detroit_ – While teams across Major League Baseball unburdened themselves of significant lumps of salary Wednesday — albeit at the expense of significant talent — the Tigers offered contracts to all nine of their arbitration- eligible players.
 What could end up costing them in excess of $20 million for the 2021 season, the Tigers extended offers to pitchers Matthew Boyd, Daniel Norris, Michael Fulmer, Buck Farmer, Joe Jimenez and Jose Cisnero, as well as first baseman Jeimer Candelario, utility man Niko Goodrum and center fielder JaCoby Jones.
 Had the Tigers not offered them contracts by 8 p.m. Wednesday, those players — all expected to be key contributors in 2021 — would’ve become free agents.
 The Tigers weren’t required to offer any contract terms to those players on Wednesday, just acknowledgment that they want them back for 2021. Those players are technically under team control. The club and players have until Jan. 15 to either work out a deal or submit salary figures to an arbitration panel.
 According to industry estimates (MLBTradeRumors.com), Boyd could get between $5.5 and $6.2 million if he went to arbitration, Norris $3 million, Fulmer 2.8 million, Jones $2.2 million, Candelario $1.7 million, Goodrum $1.6 million, Farmer $1.4 million, Jimenez $1 million and Cisnero $900,000.
 Around the league, some talented and more expensive players were non-tendered including some corner outfielders who might intrigue the Tigers. The Twins did not offer a contract to Eddie Rosario, the Cubs non-tendered slugger Kyle Schwarber and Albert Almora, Jr., and the Braves did not offer a contract to Adam Duvall.
 The Royals cut loose power-hitting third baseman Maikel Franco. He hit three of his eight home runs and knocked in 10 runs in 10 games against the Tigers last season.
 Those players, who stood to make between $6 and $10 million, can still sign back with their former clubs, of course.

 # Why the UK approved a coronavirus vaccine before the US

 LONDON — The first rigorously tested coronavirus vaccine was given a green light for use Wednesday in Britain. Doses of the vaccine, made by the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a small German company, BioNTech, will be injected starting next week, the government said.
 In leaping ahead of the United States to allow mass inoculations, Britain added to the pressure on U.S. drug regulators, who were summoned to the White House on Tuesday by President Donald Trump’s chief of staff to explain why they were not ready to do the same.

ANAHEIM, Calif.
 The Los Angeles Angels acquired veteran shortstop Jose Iglesias from the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday in a trade for minor league right-handers Garrett Stallings and Jean Pinto.
 Iglesias batted .373 with three homers and 17 RBIs in 39 games with the Orioles last season. He struggled with injuries, but posted the highest average in the majors among players with at least 100 plate appearances.
 New Angels general manager Perry Minasian expects Iglesias to be an everyday player next season as the long-struggling Angels attempt to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2014.
 "We feel really confident that he's a starting-caliber shortstop that's going to bring a lot to the table both in the clubhouse and on the field," Minasian said. "I think he's really come into his own over the last couple of years. He had an outstanding season for Baltimore. He's an outstanding defender, and he puts the ball in play."
 The Angels picked the 23-year-old Stallings in the fifth round of the 2019 draft, but he has yet to make his professional debut. Los Angeles signed the 19-year-old Pinto as an international free agent in May 2019.

Public Citizen has identified 13 patents claimed by BioNTech on its vaccine technology. However, the status of rights over the vaccine is complicated. While the development of most vaccines has been significantly funded by governments, Pfizer has claimed that they have taken no money, neither from the US government nor from anyone else (perhaps as an explanation behind why it has not made any no-profit or non-patent enforcement pledges like other developers). Although this is true on the face of it, it is not to be forgotten that their Mainz-based partner BioNTech, who supplied the mRNA technology, received EUR 375 million from the German government and another EUR 100 million in loan from the European Investment Bank. More importantly, BNT162b2 was created using ‘spike protein technology,’ reportedly developed by scientists from the US government’s National Institute of Health (NIH). US Vice President Mike Pence went so far as to call the vaccine a ‘public-private partnership.’ If this is correct, in future, the ‘March-in rights’ under the Bayh-Dole Act could technically allow the US government to stake claim on what is being called taxpayer-funded technology (see the licensing arrangements here). Aside from this, Pfizer and BioNTech have been sued for patent infringement by San Diego-based Allele Biotech for using the latter’s mNeonGreen fluorescent protein in developing the vaccine. As the companies stand poised to make $13 billion from their vaccine by next year, these multiple claims over the ownership of the technology can lead to complicated battles between the public and private players involved. (Knowledge Ecology International maintains this page containing copies of the US government’s contracts with pharmaceutical companies for COVID-19 related technologies.)

Cemetery workers had gone back to their warehouse to get dirt to fill the coffin containing the body of Rev. Valerian Schott at the Sts. Peter and Paul Cemetery in south St. Louis on Gravois on Dec. 13, 2000. The service was held in the chapel of the cemetery while the snow storm continued outside. Only a few people attended. After the service, the mourners left. The cemetery workers transported the coffin to the final resting place. Then they left to get dirt that was kept protected from the weather. After filling in the hole, one worker said to the other, "there isn't any flowers or anything". Giving flowers would have been against the spirit of Schott's vow of poverty. Rev. Schott was 94. He was a Franciscan friar for 75 years. While serving as a missionary in China, he was held in a concentration camp for five years from 1947 until 1952. He died Friday, December 8th. There were no immediate survivors.

My childhood was filled with exploration that nourished my imagination. But growing up in South America, it did not take long to pick up on the subtle, and not-so-subtle, expectation that girls’ presence ought to be small and quiet. Always polite in their opinion. The message I got growing up was that I needed permission to act or think differently. It took a lot of years of deconstruction to go against the grain. This is also another reason I named my daughter Ada. I didn’t want her to go through any of that. From the moment she utters her name, I want her to know her experiences and opinions are valuable. She need not ask permission to be different.

After the Army, I worked in Miami doing international sales for a tech company that had a Latin American division. When I was 27, I had just closed a 3M dollars deal, which was the largest I had ever closed. I was on top of the world; my commission was equivalent to someone’s annual salary, and I thought it doesn’t get better than this. A month later, the dot-com bubble popped, and I was out of a job. My only option was to go and wait tables; this was a truly humbling experience in my life. One moment I was on top of the world, and then life kicked me in the gut. But here’s the kicker, while I was waiting tables, I ended up serving a family friend, who also happened to be the mother of my business partner, Juan Rodriguez. She encouraged me to give Juan a call and catch-up, in part because we were both Dominican and Army veterans. The rest is history.

1. How to manage and motivate people. Other people are not you. They do not share your vision, and you must communicate it to them, as well as find ways to incentivize them to work towards your vision. You must find out how to stimulate them and provide them with a job that allows them to do their best work, which is always the work that interests them most.   2. The importance of a plan for your business. There’s power in the written word and knowing, by writing, what you want. You must have an executive summary. As entrepreneurs say, you must know your ask. And if you want to raise money, you must have your plan on paper. (Which leads me to…)   3. How you get funding. Growing organically is not possible when you need to run major marketing campaigns and to purchase new technology. You also need proof that you are turning a profit.   4. The amount of self-reflection and self-exploration required to find what makes you tick. Know thyself. Socrates said, “the unexamined life is not worth living,” and I live by that.   5. The importance of accounting. Start your business with good bookkeeping because you do not want to find yourself backtracking years of financial accounting on the fly.
