Over 70 lakh litres of water was sprinkled at 13 pollution hotspots in the past 36 days by the Delhi Fire Service to hold down dust as a measure to improve the deteriorating air quality in the city, officials said on Sunday. The drive began on October 17 following orders from the Delhi government to check the dust pollution in the national capital, they said According to the Fire Department, about two lakh litres of water is being sprinkled every day by its personnel at 13 places declared as pollution hotspots by the Delhi government. The places are Jahangirpuri, Narela, Ashok Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Dwarka, Mundka, Rohini, Wazirpur, Okhla, Bawana, Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh and R K Puram. A total of 15 fire tenders have been pressed into service to sprinkle water at the identified hotspots and around 45 fire personnel have been deployed for the task, said Atul Garg, Director of Delhi Fire Service. On an average, two lakh litres of water is sprinkled every day. It has been an ongoing drive ever since the directions were issued from the Delhi government. The exercise began on October 17 and since then our personnel have sprinkled more than 70 lakh litres of water across 13 identified hotspots to curb dust pollution, he said. The exercise is being carried out for nearly two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening every day, Garg said. Pollutions levels breached the emergency threshold twice this month in the national capital as a grey apocalyptic smog enveloped the city for days, blotting out the sun and smudging landmarks from view. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the “severe plus” or “emergency” category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours. Delhi witnessed six “severe” air days on the trot from November 4 to November 9. It had recorded seven “severe” air days in November last year. Pollution levels on Diwali this year and the day after were the maximum in the last four years. The Delhi government had on November 5 banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the city till November 30. The National Green Tribunal had also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases . This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign -- “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh' -- which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai. A ''green war room'' has also been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor steps being taken to bring down pollution levels in the city this winter.

 Aston Villa were denied a stonewall injury time penalty by VAR as Brighton claimed a historic and dramatic win.
 Goals from Danny Welbeck and Solly March – either side of Ezri Konsa’s equaliser – gave the Seagulls a deserved lead as they searched for their first ever win at Villa Park.
 A late sending off for Tariq Lamptey was then followed by Michael Oliver awarding Villa a penalty after March’s challenge on Trezeguet.
 But after VAR asked Oliver to carry out an on-field check on the monitor, he strangely decided to revert his original decision because of a slight touch on the ball by March.
 Dean Smith’s Villa have now lost their last three home games on the bounce.

He did the things we needed him to do to walk out of Salt Lake City with a huge win, and all of our kids did. We’re such perfectionists as coaches and as players and we know what this offense could be, and we’re going to look up and it’s going to turn from a 30-point offense into hopefully a 40- or 50-point offense. We all want more. We all want to do a little bit better, and we’ll continue to work at it, but the one thing Kedon does is he finds the way to put the team on his back and win ballgames.

You don’t have to be much of an armchair psychologist to see the ways in which Maugham was born to that vocation. He knows the ways of the English establishment, but is resolutely not of it. In a response to a typically ill- informed sneer from the far-right provocateur Katie Hopkins labelling him “the son of an old Etonian”, Maugham set out this background in a piece for the _Guardian_. He was born in 1971 to an “impressionable young woman studying sociology at North London Poly”, who had a brief affair with David Benedictus, then famous as the writer who had exposed the snobberies and sadism of his Eton education in his novel _The Fourth of June_ , and was subsequently producer of Radio 4’s _Book at Bedtime._ Maugham has the letter his mother wrote to Benedictus. “I do not expect you to marry me,” she said, “but you need to know I am pregnant.” That letter is kept on a shelf in his office next to carbon copy responses from his father’s lawyers. “Our client denies paternity,” they say, “but will make a nuisance payment of £5 a week until she marries.”

Owensboro Fire Department Battalion Chief Steve Leonard said while the department takes numerous precautions to reduce exposure to COVID-19, it’s not much different from what firefighters do regularly.
 “Our personnel is used to suiting up in attire and equipment that protects us,” Leonard said. “This is just equipment that protects us from a different type of incident.”
 OFD has limited some services, such as code enforcement and inspections, due to the pandemic, Leonard said.
 “We limit the amount of training we do,” he said.
 Firefighters at different firehouses are kept separate, and if a firefighter from another station has to come to the department’s administrative offices at Station One, the meeting is held outdoors, Leonard said. When firefighters or other emergency responders go on a call for service, 911 dispatch screens the call to determine if anyone in the home has symptoms of COVID or a diagnosis.
 “If they are COVID positive, we will take an extra layer of precautions” at the scene, Leonard said.
 The department has maintained its standard level of emergency services, he said.
 “Us being protected allows us to better protect the community,” Leonard said.
 Daviess County Fire Chief Jeremy Smith said the restrictions the department put in place at the outset of the pandemic haven’t changed.
 “As far as what we do on a day to day basis, nothing has changed, because we follow very strict guidelines,” Smith said. “We still don’t allow anyone into our stations. ... Our guys are getting temperatures taken twice a day.”
 Officer Andrew Boggess, public information officer for the Owensboro Police Department, said the department had “already made the adjustments we could make” before the county entered Red Zone status. Reports that do not require an officer’s presence are taken over the phone and officers are required to use face masks and to social distance as much as they can.
 “It’s not always possible in our profession, but we are doing as much as possible” and are following recommendations to reduce contact with the virus, Boggess said.
 Operations haven’t been negatively impacted by quarantines, Boggess said.
 “So far, it hasn’t affected our ability to operate in the manner we need to operate,” Boggess said.
 If officers had to quarantine to where it could affect staffing on a shift, “we are always prepared to make those adjustments,” he said.
 Major Barry Smith, chief deputy for the Daviess County Sheriff’s Department, said patrol deputies and the tax office are operating with precautions, such as masks, and the tax office is open to the public. People entering the county courthouse to visit the tax office are required to wear face masks and social distance.
 With tax payment season underway, the tax office would normally be busy with people. While people can pay their taxes in person, the office is asking people to pay them by mail instead, he said.
 “It limits the exposure” for the public and staff, he said.
 With the number of people allowed in the tax office limited, people coming to pay in person are having to line up in the hall.
 People can pay their taxes over the phone with a credit card, with a 2.5% fee added by the card companies. “But there’s no fee with mailing it whatsoever,” Smith said.
 Regular law enforcement operations have continued at the sheriff’s office. “We have had times when people have been off (with a COVID diagnosis) or quarantined,” Smith said. But “overall, we have been able to maintain business as usual.”

HAWESVILLE _ Hancock County shook the rust off from two weeks of no practice on a Saturday evening with a chilly drizzle.
 The Hornets took a quarter to get going then they dropped Todd County Central 36-0 in the first round of the Class 2-A playoffs at Schafer-Glover Field.
 The Hornets had been off for two weeks because of COVID-19 quarantine.
 Darian Clay provided touchdown runs of 11 and 21 yards in the second quarter. Clay went for 114 yards on 23 carries.
 Cole Dixon was as efficient as a quarterback could be, hitting his three passing attempts and notching touchdown throws of 28 and 23 yards in the third quarter.
 Dixon’s 28-yard strike was to Sebastian Fredell, who made a nice adjustment to wait for a second on the ball.
 Austin Volocko made the 23-yard touchdown catch. Volocko earlier made a 39-yard catch on third-and-9 to set up Clay’s 11-yard touchdown, which was Hancock County’s first score with 7:58 left in the second quarter.
 “We were in a tough spot on third down, and I knew our receivers were good,” Dixon said. “We knew we could beat their corners. We were just trying to get in the end zone, get the win and get to play Owensboro Catholic next week.”
 Hancock County will take a 6-1 record into its rematch with Owensboro Catholic in the second round Friday back at Schafer-Glover Field.
 The Hornets found some confidence after Jack Duncan had a strange kind of pick six. The Hancock County sophomore linebacker intercepted Todd Central quarterback Preston Moore on a play where Moore fumbled the snap, picked the ball up and still tried to pass it. Duncan snagged the ball and raced 50 yards for a 12-0 Hornets lead.
 “Once we got that second score, with Jack intercepting that pass and taking it to the house, that was a big deal,” Hancock County coach Bobby Eubanks said. “It was kind of back and forth right there. They were getting us off the field, we were getting them, and he scores there and kind of changes the outcome.
 “Typically he’s making the big hit, he was just at the right place at the right time there, and he made a good play.”
 Todd Central had trouble with the wet conditions throughout the game. Todd Central lost three fumbles and had difficultly fielding a couple of kickoffs.

Efforts to contain the violence and reach a negotiated settlement seemed successful at first, but the calm established was more apparent than real. More than two decades of deepening social cleavages between the aristocracy on the one hand and the lower and middle classes on the other came to the surface once again in late 1324. With it came the seizure of power by the lower orders in Bruges from both comital authorities and the urban patriciate, whose position in other towns, too, was increasingly precarious. No attempts by the count to turn the tables seemed to succeed. Indeed, he was captured by the rebels, and thereafter other towns, like Ypres, came under the control of revolutionary governments claiming to represent the interests of the lower classes – weavers’ governments, they have been called.

COLUMBUS -- Starting Friday, Nov. 20, and going through Sunday, Nov 29, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office will join other law enforcement agencies across the state in the Kansas Thanksgiving Safe Arrival traffic enforcement campaign.
   
 "Historically there is a significant increase in travel during the time surrounding the Thanksgiving Holiday," said Sheriff David Groves. "With the potential for increased travelers, along with events and gatherings where alcohol is commonly consumed, we want to help make sure all motorists on Cherokee County roadways get to and from their destinations safely."
   
 Groves said that, in an effort to promote safety, there will be additional law enforcement on area roadways specifically focused on unsafe drivers for the coming week.
   
 A grant from the Kansas Department of Transportation will support overtime enforcement efforts. While all Kansas traffic laws will be enforced, this extra provision will be aggressively targeting and removing impaired drivers from the roads.
   
 According to KDOT, the day before Thanksgiving sees more impairment-related crashes than any other day of the year. Those who choose to drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, are a danger to all they share the road with. On average, across Kansas, three people are injured every day, and one person is killed every four days in alcohol/drug-related crashes. Vehicle occupants in alcohol- or other drug-related crashes are over 2½ times more likely to be injured or killed than those involved in crashes where alcohol or other drugs were not a factor.

Why do the Falcons fans look at Matt Ryan as the problem of this team? He does his job, he doesn't play defense or special teams. He hands the ball off or throws to receivers for crying out loud. He makes smart decisions and when he has to run, he gallops the best he can. Why Beek, why? He can't throw it to himself, he's not the running back, and he only plays on the offense.

International politics also allowed van Artevelde a role. Strategically located for the receiving of imports from England, raw wool mainly, the city’s support seemed crucial to the French, who were intent on injuring England’s export trade during the opening years of the Hundred Years War. In fact, despite some significant French gestures to the burghers of Ghent, van Artevelde came more and more under the spell of the English, ultimately welcoming Edward III to the city and recognizing his claim as king of France. In other ways, too, partly by playing an international game, partly by his astuteness in local comital politics, and partly because Ghent was supplementing its precarious income from cloth-making by becoming a major grain staple city, van Artevelde brought Ghent to a tentative hegemony in Flanders.

That’s Baker Mayfield refusing to lose football.
 The Kyler Murray season, OU played the worst defense, presuming the field doesn’t expand, any playoff team ever will.
 Last season, it was smoke and mirrors, dodging the throwing deficiencies of a quarterback that unloaded a good deal of Riley’s tool belt.
 Right now?
 Right now, OU just finished allowing 14 points to TCU, holding Texas Tech scoreless long enough to score 42 straight and holding Kansas to a field goal until the last pay of the game.
 All this and we’re supposed to look at this Bedlam game as some should-be nailbiter, in line with Blake Bell’s 2013 cold-weather classic, the next season’s overtime tilt or 2017’s 114-points-between-the-two-teams fireworks show?
 We’re supposed to believe that because the Pokes beat Tulsa, which hasn’t lost since, 16-7? Because they’ve gone 2-1 in their last three, the wins by a combined five over Iowa State and Kansas State?
 Yes, we know, those teams beat the Sooners, but this is a classic that-was- then, this-is now scenario.
 Look, it’s possible the nation will never know how well OU’s playing right now. Instead, it will only see the Sooners as a team that righted its ship and took advantage of a struggling conference.
 But if you’ve been watching closely, you know, and if you’ve been watching Oklahoma State closely, you know the Pokes are terribly offensively challenged and you know pretty much no defense can ground Riley’s offense. Mostly, only a quarterback who can’t throw or has lost confidence can do that.
 The polls say the Pokes are in front of the Sooners and the oddsmakers that OU’s just a touchdown better. It’s hard to see how that can be.
 Tonight, enjoy it.
 It shouldn’t be close.

 A lot of positive things happened for the Cyclones against the Wildcats. So many in fact that coach Matt Campbell used the word 12 times in the first eight questions that were asked to him during the post-game press conference.
 But it wasn’t perfect.
 “We took a positive step,” Campbell said. “All good football teams want to take a positive step in November. We’ve played two games in November and I’ve seen a lot really positive growth in those games. I think a real challenge for football teams this time of year is, can you get better? I think you see us improving and that part is really big for our football team. The real challenge is can you continue to do those things?

The disruptions caused by the pandemic are exposing Europe's dependencies in certain areas.
 A new survey from the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), shared exclusively with Reuters, found more than 100 product categories in which the EU has a critical strategic dependence on imports from China.
 "Europe critically depends on Chinese imports for the pharmaceutical, chemical and electronics sectors, mostly on components produced in technologically less sophisticated areas of the value chain," MERICS researcher Max Zenglein said.
 In September, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that Germany must become less dependent on Asian suppliers in areas such as medical precursors and that Europe as a whole should try to diversify its trade relations.
 But that's easier said than done.
 In an example of the complexities, efforts by the German government to support the local production of medical face masks following the first wave of the pandemic had a mixed success.

Over open water and sparsely-populated areas, you can’t fly closer than 500 feet to any person, boat, vehicle, or structure.
 In any case, I see aircraft flying quite close to the top of this cell tower. One night last week, I was carting trash down our 100-yard driveway when I heard the unmistakable sound of an aircraft engine at idle, followed by the distinct sound of a panicked full throttle, and looked up to see the lights of the aircraft pass quite close to the top of the tower.
 I don’t want to sound preachy or panicky, but I also don’t want to witness an entirely avoidable tragedy, so I would remind aviators to remember, and remind other aviators, to be mindful of this and all other obstacles, and be safe.

"Yeah, 16 points is nice. We'd love to have even more but I saw a lot of people today saying it wouldn't be 16, and I saw a lot of people say that Utah would win. So to be able to come into a tough place and win a ball game against a Kyle Whittingham team that we have a lot of respect for and a Utah team that we have a lot of respect for and to walk out of here with a 16-point win, we'll take it. Obviously, like I said earlier, to be able to eliminate the turnover that caused points and the turnover that took points off the board for us is something that would create even more separation, to be honest with you. Really, I thought it should have been a 31-10 ball game at halftime. We let them stay in it into the second half and then we started to separate ourselves, which I'm proud of the kids for doing. But we will hit on all cylinders and I'm looking forward to that here soon. And we're close. Defensively I thought we took a major, major step ahead. Offensively, we're doing the things to win but we haven't reached our full potential yet and I look forward to that day."

“I learned that it was a very difficult job,” Russell said of the program leaders whose footsteps he’s following. “And you never get a day off. On the court, off the court, you have to set the example. That’s what I learned from [Matthews, Terrell, Andre Berry, Jarvis Garrett, Stan Robinson]. They really set the example for me to be a leader on and off the court. It doesn’t start when we leave the court. I have to be a man of my word of how I’m trying to represent this program.”
 Harris and Walker are the only other players who have donned the Keaney Blue for game action. Former junior college transfer Jeremy Sheppard is pegged for big things after sitting out last year. D.J. Johnson also sat out last season.
 The group of newcomers is headed by the transfers. Carey is a former top-40 recruit, the Mitchell twins arrived at Maryland as four-star prospects, and Martin was a Conference USA all-defense pick at Charlotte who’s now joining the ride his brother Hassan helped start.
 “They all bring something a little bit different to the table because they all play different positions. But the one commonality is they all bring college experience,” Cox said. “Even if you’re talking about limited minutes at the Big 10 level, limited minutes at the Big East level or major minutes in Conference USA, they bring tremendous experience, which will bode well for us. What do they bring also? They bring talent and depth, which helps every day in practice. You can take no practice days off, which means we can continue to get better and compete at a high level.”
 Cox also expects Leggett, a freshman guard, to make an impact. Fellow freshman Tres Berry has big potential but may have difficulty cracking the guard rotation and could redshirt. Ileri Ayo-Faleye will definitely redshirt, Cox said. URI also has Towson transfer Allen Betrand sitting out this season.
 The roster turnover comes at a tricky time. The pandemic impacted preseason workouts, with the Rams starting in small pods before working up to larger groups. They also went without exhibition games and the scrimmages with other programs that have become a staple of the ramp-up to the regular season.
 URI’s season-opening stay at Mohegan Sun, which will feature four games in five days, will be even more of an introduction than that kind of event might usually be.
 “This year is completely different,” Cox said. “Normally by this time, we would have a couple of Blue and White scrimmages, we would have had a scrimmage against another college team and we would have had an exhibition game by now. Without any of that, it’s hard to evaluate these guys without being in a true game situation. We’re going to take these first four games and kind of figure it out from there. Everyone will get a shot to showcase and we’ll kind of evaluate after this Mohegan Sun event to figure out which direction we go in.”
 Ultimately, that direction may look familiar, even if the faces don’t.
 “The fan base should know that we still have the same focus, we still have the same goals, we are still wanting to play the same style of basketball, which is with pace and space on offense, in-your-face and physical on the defensive end, and in attack mode,” Cox said. “From a fans’ point of view, I think it’s exciting to watch us play and watch us compete. And you’ll get that this year.”

Jacob Toppin doesn’t mind being in all the talk about his brother, Obi Toppin, the consensus national Player of the Year in college basketball last season.
 Jacob is a University of Kentucky transfer from Rhode Island. He will be a sophomore after being granted an NCAA waiver to play this season.
 “My brother is brought up all the time,” Jacob said in a UK virtual meeting with media. “I’m always hearing his name when I’m talking to somebody. The similarities in our game, we’re very athletic and long so we use that to our advantage. We’re very energetic. We’re all over the place. We’re hustle players. We can shoot, we can drive, we can score any way we can.”
 Jacob was on FaceTime with his brother to help celebrate Obi’s No. 8 spot in the NBA Draft to the New York Knicks on Wednesday.
 Obi will get the chance to be coached by Kenny Payne, a long-time top assistant at Kentucky until moving to the Knicks this summer.
 One of the main reasons Jacob was interested in transferring to UK was to get bigger and stronger, and more ready for a shot at the pro game.
 “He’s just a lot bigger than me and that’s what I’m trying to get to,” Jacob said. “So, that’s really the only difference we have. He plays more inside than me, but I can play inside too.”
 That meant Jacob has been going against UK inside players Olivier Sarr, Isaiah Jackson and Lance Ware.
 “I’ve been working with the bigs every day,” Jacob said. “I’m not as afraid to play in the post now, I’m getting better at it, my confidence level is definitely going up.”
 Jacob came to Kentucky more intent on getting bigger and stronger his first year than getting on the court. He was planning to redshirt, but the coaching staff looked for Jacob to get a waiver for immediate eligibility in part because of COVID-19.
 The NCAA was granting a lot of waivers to allow transfers to play this season because of the circumstances of the pandemic and the likely adoption of a one- time free transfer for all players next year. Jacob and UK coaches thought to give it a shot.
 Jacob was following the footprint that his brother set as a freshman at Dayton.
 Obi redshirted as a freshman at Dayton then worked his way into a top-10 NBA draft pick two years later.
 At 6-foot-9, 194 pounds, Jacob needs to add muscle to his lanky frame to compete against more physical inside players he will have to face at Kentucky.
 Jacob played in all 30 games at Rhode Island.
 UK coach John Calipari indicated earlier in the preseason that Jacob needs some physical improvement _ getting stronger_ although he is quick and one of the most athletic players on the team.

"Coming out of the first half thinking, not to say frustration, but lost opportunities. I really thought that should’ve been a 31-10 ballgame at halftime. We gave up 7 points offensively, and we also took seven points off the board in the red zone. I thought coming out in that first drive was really important. We drove it down and got some points on the board. I thought Graham [Harrell] did a nice job of putting the plan together, and the kids went down and executed it. Would love to have touchdowns over field goals, but we kept adding the points up. As good as the defense was playing, we just said, OK, just keep adding the points, securing the ball, and I thought we got in a little better rhythm in the second half. Obviously, the penalty that brought back the touchdown, followed by a turnover, and then the turnover for a touchdown in the first half is just what sticks out to me."

Tristan Thompson agreed on a two-year, $19 million contract to join the Celtics — ending his nine-year stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers, a person with knowledge of the deal told the AP.
 Thompson averaged 9.4 points and 8.7 rebounds in his nine seasons, a stint that obviously included playing a key part of helping Cleveland win its lone NBA championship in 2016. He leaves as the Cavaliers' No. 3 career rebounder and played in 447 consecutive games from 2012 through 2017.
 DALLAS
 Wesley Iwundu agreed on a two-year deal with the Mavericks, another low-key addition as the club tries to improve its athleticism and get a little tougher around young stars Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis.
 The 25-year-old Houston native spent his first three seasons in Orlando after the Magic drafted Iwundu early in the second round in 2017. He has career averages of 5.8 points and 2.5 rebounds.
 DENVER
 Paul Millsap is staying with the Nuggets on a one-year deal that will be worth around $10 million, a person with knowledge told AP. The news of the forward's decision was first reported by The Athletic and The Denver Post.
 MIAMI
 The Heat agreed to a two-year deal starting at $5.9 million for this season with top defensive guard Avery Bradley, agent Charles Briscoe said.
 Bradley has averaged 11.8 points in his career. He spent last season with the Lakers but did not accompany them to the NBA restart bubble at Walt Disney World. He averaged 8.6 points in 49 games, mostly starts, for the Lakers last season.
 The second year of that deal is at the Heat option , just like the deals they struck Friday with returnees Goran Dragic and Meyers Leonard. That protects Miami's spending flexibility for the summer of 2021.
 Moe Harkless, who was briefly — on paper, anyway — a member of the Heat in July 2019 before getting moved as part of the trade that brought Jimmy Butler to Miami, is now with the Heat and for real this time.
 Harkless agreed to a $3.6 million contract, a person with knowledge told AP. For now, the Heat intend to use their biannual exception to land Harkless, who averaged 5.6 points in 62 games last season with the Los Angeles Clippers and New York.
 MILWAUKEE
 Priority Sports announced that Bobby Portis, who averaged 10.1 points last season for New York, agreed to a deal with the Bucks. Later Saturday, a person with knowledge of the move told AP that Milwaukee and guard D.J. Augustin agreed on a three-year contract. ESPN said that deal was worth $21 million.
 ORLANDO
 Michael Carter-Williams is returning to the Magic on a two-year contract, a person with knowledge of the matter told AP. The Athletic first reported that agreement. Carter-Williams averaged 7.2 points in 45 games off Orlando's bench last season.
 PHILADELPHIA
 Dwight Howard became the first announced free-agent signing of this offseason, completing his one-year, $2.6 million deal. He signed Saturday; players on certain kinds of contracts, like the veteran minimum one he agreed to Friday night, did not have to wait for the traditional signing period to begin Sunday.
 PHOENIX
 Forward Jae Crowder, a big part of Miami's run last season to the NBA Finals, agreed on a three-year contract that will be worth nearly $30 million to join the Phoenix Suns, according to a person familiar with those negotiations.
 Crowder became a starter last season for the Heat and averaged 12.0 points in Miami's playoff run. He becomes another key veteran addition to the Suns, who finished last season with an 8-0 run in the restart bubble at Disney and swung a trade earlier this month for All-Star point guard Chris Paul to play alongside All-Star shooting guard Devin Booker.
 PORTLAND
 Carmelo Anthony is coming back for an 18th season, agreeing Saturday night on a one-year deal to remain with the Trail Blazers, a person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed to AP.
 Portland gave Anthony an opportunity to extend his career last season and he rewarded the Blazers by starting all 58 of his appearances and averaging 15.4 points.
 Anthony is currently 15th on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 26,446 points. That's only 50 points behind No. 14 Tim Duncan, 220 points behind No. 13 Dominique Wilkins, 266 points behind No. 12 Oscar Robertson and exactly 500 points back of No. 11 Hakeem Olajuwon.

 “It’s playing together and that part is what good football teams do. We’re not just offense. We’re not just defense. We’re a team and that’s what we strive to be. So I think in general, you’re seeing us getting better playing the sport of football and playing team football along the way. And for that I am really proud of our guys growth.

Martha “Marty” Snyder Winkler, 66, passed away Thursday, Nov. 19, 2020, from complications due to COVID-19. She was an Owensboro native and the fourth and youngest daughter of the late Oswald Harold and Helen Cary Snyder. “Last, but certainly not least,” Marty was quick to point out, generally followed by the roar of her infectious laugh, a characteristic which meant you could always find her in a crowd and often at the center of it.
 A 1971 graduate of Owensboro High School, Marty was the “mature one” among her peers, and a fiercely loyal and protective friend. She was athletic, competitive, fun-loving and an impeccable dresser. A swimmer, diver and figure skater, her adventurous plans for an Ice Capades career were kiboshed by her father as quickly as her attempt to reach the Woodstock Festival — her daddy firmly putting his foot down (as the theatrical retelling went) on the other side of the Glover H. Cary bridge when the escape car approached.
 Marty was wholehearted in life, embracing what she did and how she loved with no holds barred. It was how she loved her family and friends, and how she loved Bob Winkler, her husband of too few years, but a lifetime of love. She was a young widow, and “not a day passes,” Marty would often say, when she didn’t think of him. Family meant everything to Marty, and her ferocious love for us was palpable. “I miss your face” and “I love you” carried the overwhelming authenticity of her claims, and she was never afraid to show it.
 She had an exquisite eye for detail, and her professional life as an interior designer reflected the often unexpected pairing of her playfulness and elegance. Her rare gift for inclusivity and setting people at ease could be translated aesthetically: She imbued her work with something of herself, and her generosity of spirit left her clientele’s homes and businesses welcoming and more gracious as a result.
 Marty’s place is secure in the genealogical tree she crafted in the seventh grade, and her family legacy is one of her love, kindness, compassion and nonjudgmental acceptance of others.
 Her sister, Helen “Cissy” Lawrence, preceded her in death.
 She is survived by two sisters, Edith Snyder Tyler and Bess Cary Snyder; her stepdaughter, Trish Johnson; son-in-law Tim Johnson; two grandchildren, Christopher and Matthew; and numerous cousins, nieces and nephews, all of whom she adored.
 Due to the ongoing pandemic, visitation and services will not be held at this time. Marty will be laid to rest in Lexington Cemetery beside her beloved husband. A celebration of her life is planned when her family and friends can all participate.

 Niemann set up a page on Instagram in an effort to raise the money. He has pledged all his earnings for his final two events of the year, the RSM Classic and Mayakoba Golf Classic, along with $5,000 or every birdie and $10,000 for every eagle. Niemann has 15 birdies through three rounds at Sea Island, though too many bogeys to be in the mix. He goes into the final round in a tie for 55th.
 He said soccer players in Chile are sharing the news on social media, and Niemann is trying to do his part.
 "I thought I could do a big help here in the U.S. because being here on the tour, there is a lot of people that is really interested in this kind of stuff," Niemann said. "And if I'm able to help Rafita to get his medicine, it would be a dream for me come true."
 Rafita's father is the cousin of Niemann's mother. Niemann said he grew up playing golf with Felipe Calderson during his rise that took him to the Latin American Amateur and his first trip to the Masters as a 19-year-old amateur.
 Niemann missed his return to Augusta National last week when he tested positive for the coronavirus and self-isolated for 10 days. He is in the Masters next April from reaching the Tour Championship for the first time.

 Lowe went on to make the most of the new rule which permits clubs to use up to five substitutes in a game.
 There was a triple change at the start of the second period, with the Pilgrims trailing 3-0 at that point.
 Defender Niall Canavan, plus strikers Ryan Hardie and Luke Jephcott, were sent on, with Grant, Jerome Opoku and Dom Telford making way.
 Lowe said: “We needed a response. I had to make the three changes then because I couldn’t just make one.
 “I had to make three all together. They are all the rules. I thought Naz (Canavan) might get us something from a set play, and he might get us playing a bit more.
 “We went to a 3-4-3 and pushed Hardie and Jephcott alongside Frank. We tried to get back in the game.”
 The plan did not work out, though, as Fleetwood extended their lead to 5-0 before Jephcott replied with his seventh goal of the season in the 84th minute.

Austin said his interest was sparked when his father gave him a set of toy airplanes.
 “When I was four or five, my dad got me for Christmas a little airplane set that came with about 40 different airplanes,” he said. “Ever since then they have just seemed very interesting to me. I always watch old war moves with airplane scenes.”
 Today both students are flying real airplanes and getting ever closer to earning their coveted private pilots’ licenses.
 Eric, 17, flew his first solo flight in February and has done so multiple times since then. “I’ve already landed at tower airports and flown and landed at night,” he said.
 In 2017 the Ada City School District was the first and only Oklahoma school district granted permission to implement the program by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) based in Frederick, Maryland. Today, 15 additional Oklahoma school districts are doing so.
 Paula Kedy, retired educator and administrator with Ada City Schools, was in on the ground floor getting the program started. It began with a phone call from local pilot and architect Don Childers and others who asked her, “If we pay your way to Seattle, would you go to a STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics) aviation conference?”
 It was there that she learned about the AOPA program. Ms. Kedy, a former English teacher, admits that she felt like a fish out of water listening to technical jargon about flying. “But at the end, they said, ‘If anybody here is interested in applying to test this curriculum, here is the application.’
 “I thought, well, I can do that,” she said.
 “We brought the curriculum in and started on one section of aviation 1. We had 16 or 17 kids there in that class that year. They are now seniors,” she said.
 Mrs. Kedy currently serves as aerospace and aviation education program coordinator for the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission. Part of her responsibilities is to inform other educators about the program.
 “Superintendents are interested because they see how interested the kids are,” Mrs. Kedy says. With state budget cuts the rule rather than the exception, the issue is money. While the curriculum is provided free, other required materials are not. Flight simulators alone cost $4,500 to as much as $10,000 each.
 Ada City Schools funding has come from grants from the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission, American Airlines and those available through the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. Among other items, this has allowed Ada City Schools to install eight flight simulators at the high school and four at the junior high. Another five simulators are on order.
 Taking the program on also means school superintendents must allocate a teacher to instruct budding aviation students.
 Mrs. Kedy says the fact Ada City Schools has provided aviation instructors demonstrates Superintendent Mike Anderson’s financial commitment to the program.
 Children as young at pre-k are made aware of the program with what Mrs. Kedy refers to as “‘A’ is for airplane.”
 Seventh and eighth grade students can take technical education classes that touch on aviation in which they fly drones and learn about avionics and flying in general.
 Serious instruction begins as an elective in ninth grade under Stefanie Tweedy. Chris Eckler teaches Aviation 2, 3 and 4 at Ada High School, electives available to any student interested in learning about aviation.
 Mr. Eckler said the first year of instruction covers the history of aviation, aerospace and engineering. “With year two, we dive into how an airplane works; we look at different types of engines, the different types of landing gear, the different airplane systems and why the airplane is able to fly,” he said.
 “Students in year two and three get a lot of simulator time. They are figuring out how an airplane works and getting to visualize it on the simulator. Year three is more weather and flight planning and learning how to read sectional charts and mapping. They fly the courses they map out on the simulators.”
 Mr. Eckler said the fourth year of instruction involves learning Instrument Flight Rules and how to fly in clouds and bad weather. Students also do research projects, write research papers and learn critical thinking skills.
 Mr. Eckler says science and math are required when students plan flights. “In year two students calculate weight and balance,” he said. “They look at a Cessna 172, for example, and learn that just because there are four seats doesn’t mean they can take four friends with them because the plane may not be able to carry that much payload off the ground.
 “You have to think about how much they weigh, how much their baggage weighs, how much fuel you’re carrying on board and how hot it is outside. Depending on how hot it is, the runway might not be long enough to generate enough speed to pick yourself off the ground.”
