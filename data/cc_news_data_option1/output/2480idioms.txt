So, Barry takes Millie back to her fathers, and Kara takes Tommy back to Cutter, and the two lovebirds come clean about affair. Barry and Kara find themselves having to defend Millie and Tommy, which ends up making them realize how they've screwed up their love lives: Barry realizes that this stupid breakup with Iris needs to end because all that matters is that they're together, and Kara now understands why Mon-El would've lied. Stein, Digsby/Joe, and Malcom/Cutter then go into a moving as hell rendition of "More I Cannot Wish You" from _Guys and Dolls,_ which is their way of telling their children they support them. All of the men give amazingly poignant performances, especially Martin, who does that thing with his eyes where he looks like he's just on the verge of tears. That being said, the song really only works in the context of the movie musical and doesn't have that much to do with the real characters themselves -- unless you read the scene as reminding Kara and Barry of how important love is. However, as soon as it's over, both Millie's dads and Tommy's dad tell their men to prepare for war.

Anticipated general fund revenue is about half a million dollars less than this year’s budget sum, with $5.8 million expected, compared to $6.3 million. But thanks to record-setting local-option tax revenue over the winter, the city is $20,000 to $30,000 ahead of its fiscal 2020 projections, which will serve it well in the coming months as LOT is expected to fall below estimates due to the pandemic.
 “Thank God we had an unbelievable winter,” Femling told the council last week.
 With most fall events canceled at the Sun Valley Resort, the city forecasts a 48 percent reduction in LOT during the calendar year fourth quarter, which runs October through December. That would add up to a total projected LOT revenue of $1.75 million in 2021, 15 percent below 2019 numbers.

Ignoring the danger isn’t a great game plan for living in the future. According to former Harvard Professor William Haseltine, 20 percent of people who get COVID-19 will be asymptomatic or mildly ill. More serious cases may not result in death, but may mean blood clots in the brain, kidney issues that need lifelong dialysis and aorta weakness. COVID-19 can make people really sick for a long time.
 A vaccine is not coming over the hill to the rescue any time soon, Haseltine adds. Despite massively funded research and distribution efforts, discovering and adequately testing a vaccine is notoriously difficult and time consuming.
 As we move into summer, we all must be careful to avoid the free-for-all created when people pretend the virus has taken a summer break. It hasn’t, and we don’t want to lose the space to breath that we worked hard to create.
 Instead, we should create coronavirus bubbles. Let those family members and friends who also pay attention to keeping social distance, wearing masks, washing hands and staying home at the first sign of illness into your bubble. If anyone else asks to come into your bubble, give yourself permission to politely say no. Such bubbles can give us a way to envision a new normal.

The County’s latest statement also focused on nursing facilities.
 "To date, Public Health has distributed over 4.8 million masks and almost 1 million N-95 masks to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities," county public health director Barbara Ferrer said.
 All 315 skilled nursing facilities in LA County, not including Long Beach and Pasadena, have completed testing of all residents and staff. Out of more than 35,000 tests results available for residents and staff, 5% tested positive for COVID-19 and 82% of the people testing positive were asymptomatic or pre- symptomatic, the County statement said.
 Unlike previous large jumps in daily cases, Ferrer said this week that the recent increases were not attributable solely to backlogs in test reports from testing labs. Instead, she said the increases were indicative of increased community spread of the virus, likely the result of more people being out of their homes as sectors of the economy reopened.
 Such a rise was anticipated when the county began reopening businesses about a month ago, leading to more people being out of their homes and interacting with other people. Although no clusters of cases have been specifically linked to recent mass protests against police brutality, Ferrer said it was also highly likely that those marches - many of which included large numbers of people without masks and ignoring social-distancing mandates - caused more spread of the virus.
 Continued increases in hospitalizations and positivity rates in testing could raise the possibility of the county re-imposing business closures and stricter stay-at-home orders to avoid overwhelming hospitals.
 "Public Health will monitor the data closely to see how increases in cases and rates of positivity affect the number of daily hospitalizations over the next few weeks," according to a Tuesday statement from the county DPH.
 "Our collective goal is to prevent an overwhelming surge of COVID-19 cases at health care facilities."

Once the number is over, Barry and Kara get pulled in the movie musical drama as Professor Martin Stein (Victor Garber) kidnaps them. (I didn't catch Stein's name in this universe).

Needless to say, both Barry and Kara are unnerved seeing their ex-significant others hooking up with each other. It doesn't take much effort to convince Millie and Tommy to come clean to their parents, because characters in movie musicals are very simple. This episode has a lot of fun playing with the tropes of movie musicals. It's meta in that way.

“We’ve gotten a little pushback, but it just feels like the right thing to do,” said Dain Hamilton, who owns the store with his wife, Victoria. “We’d much rather it end up being an unnecessary restriction that we over-enforced and everybody was fine than go the other way and end up losing our loved ones throughout the valley.”
 The store is also offering free home delivery and curbside pickup in light of the pandemic. Curbside pickup remains a fairly popular option for customers, Hamilton said, though the store doesn’t get many calls for home delivery.
 For customers who do come inside the store, ThunderPaws would ask that they wash their hands before entering, Hamilton said. There is also hand sanitizer available inside the store.
 Backwoods Mountain Sports, which was named Best Outdoor Gear Shop, is also maintaining strict sanitation and social distancing protocol.
 “Basically, we’ve stuck to our guns through this whole thing,” managing partner Paddy McIlvoy said.
 A mask is required for customers who physically come into the store, though “if people don’t have a mask we’ve made it really clear that we’re more than happy to bring stuff to them outside,” McIlvoy said. Hand sanitizer stations are positioned at the front door, and staff reserve the right to limit the number of customers inside the store at any given time.
 “We’re basically sticking with that rule until there’s a vaccine, is the decision we’ve made,” McIlvoy said. “We feel it’s important for the health and safety of our community.”
 Customers are allowed to try clothes on as usual, McIlvoy said. But clothes that are tried on and ultimately not bought are put on a dedicated rack outside the store for several days before they’re brought back inside and put back on the shelf.

“This species doesn’t occur anywhere else on earth,” says Don Zaroban, curator of fishes at the College of Idaho. “Once they’re gone, they’re gone. That’s concerning.”
 Right off the bat, Zaroban—who has dedicated a lengthy portion of his career studying the Wood River sculpin—can name a few reasons why the fish was added to the “near threatened” category of the IUCN Red List in 2011.
 “Their native range has contracted, by and large from irrigation projects. With Silver Creek being the sole exception, you probably won’t find it south of Highway 20,” he said. “Add in erosion, culverts and migration barriers at road crossings, and you have a lot of riparian habitat being lost. Their populations are fragmenting.”
 Despite being the size of an hors d’oeuvre, Zaroban says, the Wood River sculpin requires ample living space in and around rocks and boulders.
 “If you get a stream that’s sand-bottomed, you may see a few sculpin hiding in vegetation, but they truly need a cobble substrate to survive,” he said. “If you have a lot of runoff from streambank erosion, for example—the fish are going to bug out of there, because their living conditions are no longer right.”
 Based on a fish census that Zaroban helped conduct, an estimated 800,000 Wood River sculpin resided in the Big Wood River two decades ago. Today, their population is unknown. The same goes for much of their life history, spawning behaviors and migration patterns.
 To help uncover some of the mysteries shrouding freshwater sculpins in North America—a family that includes the Wood River sculpin—fisheries research biologist Michael Young is spearheading the Sculpin Qwest project at the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station.
 “The idea behind Sculpin Qwest was to use genetic tools to try and recognize the diversity of sculpins across the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions,” Young said of the project, which kicked off in 2014.
 Until last fall, ichthyologists across the West, including Zaroban, mailed thousands of sculpin tail clippings to Young for DNA analysis. (Tail clippings don’t harm sculpins, Young said—they’re actually prone to damaging that fin in the wild and can regrow it.)
 “More important to sculpins are the pectoral fins up near the chest, which they use like a rudder on a plane to navigate up and down along the stream bottom,” he said.
 From extracting DNA from the fin tissue of Wood River sculpins and sequencing it, Young realized that the fish is genetically closest to its even more imperiled cousin, the Shoshone sculpin.
 “How the Shoshone sculpin has managed to persist in Idaho over the last 40,000 years, I have no idea,” he said. “Today, it’s limited to just a few springs.”

“It’s my job to uphold that Constitution,” Toone said. “It’s like a speeding ticket—you know the law. Whether you like all the points of it or not, it’s your job to uphold it.”
 A legal opinion by two Arizona-based attorneys, commissioned by the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation, argued that lawmakers had the right to convene a special session themselves, pointing to a section of the Idaho Constitution that lets the Legislature take action that is “necessary and proper” to ensure “the continuity of governmental operations” in “periods of emergency resulting from disasters caused by enemy attack.”
 “[T]here is at the very least a reasonable factual basis for the Legislature to find that the virus and the destruction it has wrought derived at least in part from the concerted hostile activities of foreign actors,” the opinion stated, citing “credible evidence…that the pathogen may have its genesis in a Chinese laboratory” and “a concerted campaign of false propaganda” by “hostile foreign actors” on social media, “intended to undermine the United States government and amplify social and economic instability inflicted by the pandemic.”
 In response, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office issued a legal opinion maintaining that only the governor has the authority to call a special session under the Idaho Constitution. A separate legal opinion from an attorney who represents the Legislature independently of the Attorney General’s Office agreed that the Legislature does not have the authority to call itself into a special session, the Idaho Press reported.
 Parker said he and members of his organization had reviewed each of the legal opinions and found them all to be compelling.
 “You can make a strong argument one way, you can make a strong argument the other way,” Parker said. “There’s no clear answer as far as we can tell and it’s going to have to be handled by the judicial branch. Having said that, we’re going to go support the legislative branch and those that feel like they need to speak up.”
 Davis told the Mountain Express that she understood the grievances of the lawmakers who gathered Tuesday, and had heard from some of her own constituents who disagreed with the steps the governor has taken to address the pandemic. She said she anticipates that some discussion of the state’s pandemic response will take place in the 2021 regular legislative session.
 “This is bringing to light some things that maybe Idahoans want to see changed,” she said. “But until that happens, we have to follow the law.”
 Both Davis and Toone said they haven’t agreed with every aspect of the governor’s coronavirus response. For instance, they said, they would like to see more support given to the essential workers who worked while the state’s self-isolation order was in place throughout March and April.
 “I wouldn’t have done everything exactly the same way,” Davis said. “But I’m not sure breaking the Constitution is how we go about making these changes.”
 Davis and Toone both noted that there are three legislators serving on the governor’s Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee, which oversees spending of the roughly $1.25 billion in coronavirus aid that Idaho has received from the federal government. Lawmakers who don’t sit on that committee are “on phone calls continually” with Little, Toone said.
 “I appreciate all the work that he has done to include all of us,” she said. “He has not ventured by himself.
 “Have the committees done everything I like?” she continued. “No. But that is part of our process. You don’t always get your way 100 percent of the time. It’s about the conversation and a little give and take and what’s best for everyone.”

Due to limited water availability this year, Northen anticipates a shorter irrigation season with early canal closures. He also expects the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to initiate a trout salvage for the Big Wood River south of Magic Reservoir, meaning people would be able to net as many ill- fated fish as they want.
 “In high-water seasons, trout survival is better because they have the option to migrate to deeper, cooler pools. But in low-water seasons when the water is shut off, they can’t access those areas,” he said.
 According to U.S. Geological Survey data, the Big Wood River has experienced record low flows this month—a factor that may be accelerating evaporation. From June 8-17, the Lions Park gauge site in Hailey recorded an average flow rate of about 537 cubic feet per second, well below the average for that time period of 1,585 cfs. Farther north in Ketchum, the Big Wood River hit its lowest-ever recorded flows for those 10 days; the previous low-flow records for June 8-17 were set in 1966 and 2013, USGS data show.
 Northen, an avid fly fisherman, said installing fish screens at diversion points or shutting off water more gradually could dramatically boost fish survival—but those changes are costly to implement.
 “The Big Wood River is a very resilient fishery. It’s amazing how well trout have survived, given the circumstances,” he said. “But if we could work with water users on reducing irrigation demand and collaborate more closely with the [Big Wood] canal company, we could see a world-class fishery.”
 A subsequent Trout Unlimited rescue project near Gannet Road is planned for this week, Northen said, and further relocation efforts will continue until fall.
 “It’s troubling to see trout end up in hot water and die, especially when you have the opportunity to relocate them,” he said. “Dewatering, unfortunately, has occurred for decades.”
 In an interview last week, Fish and Game spokesman Terry Thompson stressed that it’s illegal to transport live fish without a permit due to the possibility of spreading disease across water bodies. That goes for even well- intentioned efforts to relocate trapped fish after water is diverted or turned off, he said, and Trout Unlimited is able to carry out its projects only because it has the necessary permitting.
 Anyone interested in volunteering with Trout Unlimited on future trout-rescue projects can contact the Hemingway chapter at hemingwaytu@me.org.
