USD/CHF regains some positive traction on the last day of the week. The prevailing risk-on mood, some USD strength remained supportive. Bulls might be reluctant to place aggressive bets ahead of NFP report. The USD/CHF pair edged higher through the early European session on Friday and is currently placed near two-week tops, around mid-0.9700s. Following the previous session's brief pause, the pair managed to regain some positive traction on the last trading day of the week and was looking to build on its recent steady recovery from multi-month lows set on December 31st. Upside seems limited ahead of NFP The prevailing risk-on mood, supported by the de- escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and optimism over the US-China phase-one trade deal, weighed on the Swiss franc's safe-haven status and remained supportive. It is worth recalling that the prospect of an imminent war between the US and Iran ebbed on Wednesday after the US President Donald Trump signalled that there will be no further military action against the Islamic Republic. This coupled with some follow-through US dollar appreciation collaborated to the pair's positive tone. However, a modest weakness in the US Treasury bond yields might turn out to be the only factor capping gains for the USD. Moreover, investors' reluctance to place any aggressive bets ahead of the closely watched US monthly jobs report (NFP) might further collaborate towards keeping a lid on any runaway rally for the major, at least for the time being.

TRUCKER FATALLY SHOTTrucker found shot inside vehicle, suspect surrendersMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A Tennessee truck driver was found fatally shot inside his tractor-trailer and authorities say a suspect surrendered to deputies a day later. The Shelby County Sheriff's Office says the truck driver was from Hermitage and was found fatally shot inside his truck Wednesday on Interstate 269 near Memphis. After reviewing video footage inside the cab, detectives called it a homicide investigation. The sheriff's office tweeted out a description of a suspect, who turned himself in Thursday. The suspect was not identified and there was no word on possible charges.BUS DRIVER-DUI CHARGESchool bus driver involved in crash charged with DUIMOSHEIM, Tenn.

(AP) — A former Tennessee governor told a newspaper he doesn’t feel qualified for the honor of having the state’s legislative office building renamed for him. The Daily Memphian reported Monday that Republican former Gov. Winfield Dunn said he has reservations about state Rep. Ron Gant's efforts to rename Nashville's Cordell Hull Office Building. The 92-year-old politician emphasized that he still “deeply” appreciates the consideration. Gant responded that he wouldn't pursue the measure if it's not wanted, though he said many legislators supported his idea. The building is named for a Tennesse Democratic congressman who served as Secretary of State under President Franklin Roosevelt and was a Nobel Peace Prize winner.AP-US-COUNTRY- MUSIC-HALL-OF-FAMECountry Music Hall of Fame breaks attendance record in 2019NASHVILLE, Tenn.

It was in the under-17 men’s race where spectators witnessed the most thrilling finish of the entire day involving Chichester’s Liam Dunne. As the 5k race unfolded, a group of three detached themselves from the rest of the leading pack on the final lap of three and with just under half a mile to go the leading pair pulled clear with Dunne chasing Adam Dray from Lewes as hard as he could.
 On the long, straight finishing section with the waiting crowds in sight, Dunne pulled level with his rivals and both headed for the line neck and neck ad from somewhere the Lewes man drew into reserves of energy to win the title by the thickness of a vest with both athletes given the same time.
 In the same race Archie Sadler was pleased to finish 19th in his first year in the age group but the absence of a third runner meant that Chichester were not able to contest the team race.
 Nicole Boltwood led the under-17 women home in 18th supported well by Amelia Bromell in 23rd and Rose Potter 25th for a total of 66 points and sixth team.

Under-13s and under-15s
 In the junior races at the start of the event, Chichester were unlucky not to win team medals in both the under-13 races.
 The girls’ leading trio of Lillie Hellyer in 11th, twin sister Laila 12th and Florence Ingram 15th were separated by less than half a minute and posted a team total of 38th points, agonisingly a single point off the bronze medal placings.
 Reserves Ela Pemberton and Millie Isitt both ran well in 24th and 30th places respectively.
 For the boys, Chichester’s leading trio were in a safe medal position for most of the race but Josh Dunne was unlucky to twist his knee on one of the uneven parts of the course and had to walk back to the finish.
 This left Alessandro Schmitt as the club’s leading runner in eighth with Noah Collins overtaking Will Bailley near the finish for 22nd and 26th places with reserve Digby Fulford close behind in 38th.
 Even without Dunne, the team score of 56 points was good enough for fifth. There was a sixth place for the under-15 girls with Gemma Appleton leading the team home in 17th followed by Issy Isitt in 23rd and Amelia McGurk 27th.
 Even though the under-15 boys were only tenth team, another three points less would have brought them home in seventh, this despite the club’s top two, Joe McLarnon and Fin Roberson, being unable to compete.
 Hal Edgar led the club home in a fine 18th place followed by Gabryel White in 25th and James Davies 38th for a team total of 81 points.
 Senior men and women
 It was a question of what might have been for Chichester’s senior teams with each finishing in a highly respectable fifth place despite missing a number of key athletes.
 As with the under-20s, both of Chichester’s first runners home were a product of the club’s thriving junior section with Harry Leleu and Charlotte Reading joining the club in school Year 6 as ten-year-olds.
 Leleu has made his mark on the international triathlon circuit in the past year and ran a great race on in a high-class field to gain automatic selection for the inter counties.
 Always with the front pack over the testing 10.3k course, Leleu even had a chance of his first Sussex individual medal on the final lap. However he could not quite close enough on the final hill and had to settle for fifth.
 Also clawing his way through the field was evergreen James Baker who achieved a fine tenth place at 42 years of age against his younger rivals. Two places further back was Will Boutwood, now back in Chichester after three years at St Mary’s College, making it the first time in the club’s 35-year history they have scored three runners in the top dozen in this competition.
 Chris West was back in action as a senior, nearly 20 years after being one of the top juniors in the UK as an under-13. His 41st place was followed by 73rd from Steve Davey and 86th from Mike Moorcroft with reserve Paul Stallard in 90th.
 In the women’s race, competitors had to tackle the 10k distance for the first time. The fact the course was over-distance and the terrain had already been trodden by hundreds of pairs of runners beforehand made conditions challenging for all concerned.
 Despite these difficulties, Chichester’s team of six all performed with credit. Reading was especially pleased with her 17th place in 46 minutes, a time that would have beaten a number of men over the same course.
 Aleksandra Vargin was next home in 26th with the remaining four athletes well into their veteran categories. One of the country’s top over-60 runners, Helen Dean, was 34th followed by Amanda Godfrey 39th, Sue Baker 42nd and the club’s amazing over-70 runner Wendy Whelan in 52nd.
