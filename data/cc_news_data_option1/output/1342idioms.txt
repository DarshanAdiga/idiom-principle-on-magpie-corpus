On March 31, the San Francisco _Chronicle_ published a leaked letter that Crozier had sent to senior U.S. military leaders pleading with them to do more to protect the crew of the _Roosevelt_ , where an outbreak of the coronavirus was underway, infecting — by that point — at least 100 of the 4,000 sailors aboard. Crozier asked that the sailors be removed from the ship and allowed to quarantine for two weeks. “Keeping over 4,000 young men and women on board the _TR_ is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care,” he argued. “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die.”

My wife and I have lived in our house in Sherman Oaks for 15 years, making the mortgage payments every month, in good times and bad. The house, which we share with our two English mastiffs, represents the bulk of our savings. Now those savings are under threat.
 I work in patient services for a medical company that provides elective surgeries, and with most elective procedures canceled, I’ve been laid off for the duration of the coronavirus crisis. My wife is an interior designer, and she’s been laid off, too. Her clients have delayed or canceled jobs because they are understandably worried about having workers in their homes while coronavirus is raging.
 Because the bulk of my wife’s work is for a firm, and she was an employee, she quickly qualified for unemployment, which will help. I am an independent contractor, so technically am self-employed. My application for unemployment was denied, though I am appealing that decision.
 When we called our mortgage lender to see if we might qualify for a payment reduction during the time we’re out of work, they offered something that at first sounded great: suspension of payments for three months. Then we read the fine print. Yes, we wouldn’t have to make the payments now, but in three months, the bill for them would come due.
 That sounds terrifying. We have no way of knowing whether we’ll have our jobs back in three months, and even if we do, we aren’t going to get a sudden infusion of cash that will cover three months of back mortgage payments. We worry that if we take this deal, we’ll be facing foreclosure down the road.
 In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo has asked lenders to suspend mortgage payments for three months to customers facing financial stress because of coronavirus. Under his plan, repayment would be tacked onto the end of the mortgage, so people would simply take a bit longer to repay the loan. That sounds entirely reasonable.
 My wife and I are doing what we’ve been asked to do. Staying in much of the time. My wife fights the boredom with jigsaw puzzles and old movies; I’ve done some catching up on old sports and organizing of the garage. We walk the dogs — maintaining 6-foot distances from any neighbors we see — and go out to market as needed.
 And we worry.
 We need the kind of relief Cuomo has called for in New York in California, too.

 Every 24 hours it seems the news cycle changes.
 Every 24 hours it seems the Pandemic crisis changes.
 But the one thing that doesn't change is the effort of the Daily Independent which has instituted remote reporting and other efforts. We practice safe social distancing. Zoom is good; conference calls are good and other social media platforms are good, too.
 You can now access any Coronavirus story developed locally by Lauren, Jessica or Jack on our website at no charge. However, others developed nationally may require registration but still may be free to access, too.
 E-edition subscribers not only get the paper but all of the special sections, too. For instance yesterday the digital edition included a bonus Time & Money section sponsored by Alta One. Additionally, each e-edition also includes a six-page National Health Section as well as a multi-topic Digital Extra news section that covers multiple topics.
 I am extremely proud of the efforts of our staff which has rose to the occasion much like they did during the earthquakes. I'm sure they won't get the recognition from CNN or other news organizations this time around.....but rest assured their ability to cover local angles and reach out nationally has been second to none.
 Personal health has been at the forefront, but now comes the continued worry about \"business health.\"
 Coronavirus has altered the lifestyle of many local businesses. Some have made the decision not to re-open for whatever reason. Others have closed due to financial reasons.
 It will probably never be business as usual in Ridgecrest and the high desert again, but we can all help set the tone for whatever the future holds. Shop local should be top of the mind awareness.
 Also financially Kern County will be hard-pressed to serve the needs of the public. With oil prices below $18 a barrel yesterday, the top revenue producer for the county will be a shell of itself.
 Coupled with the expected bankruptcy of oil-related businesses, the forecast gets worse. And then with several ag fields being fallowed....well, you get the picture.
 Another county fiscal declaration appears in the offing.
 Locally the city will be hard hit with sales tax and TOT tax receipts. Ridgecrest Area Convention and Visitors and Bureau will all but lose funding as hotel occupancy is at an all-time low which will affect the financial capability for the previously announced Visitors Center.
 Tough times are here now, but the future for our area is solid. China Lake's earthquake rebuild will yield many dollars to the local economy. For that, we are blessed.
 Prediction: 4th quarter will be really good for Ridgecrest and a great Christmas shopping trend for local businesses will occur.

Washington, Apr 5 (PTI) Describing the upcoming period of the coronavirus pandemic as a "Pearl Harbor" and a "9/11 moment" for the US, the country's top doctor on Sunday warned this week is going to be the hardest and the saddest one for most Americans.
 His warning came as the number of people infected people in the US has exceeded 300,000, with the death toll climbing past 9,000; more than 4,000 of those deaths are in the New York state.
 Surgeon General Vice Admiral Jerome Adams said the coronavirus pandemic rivals some of the darkest moments in US history, including the two worst foreign attacks on American soil: the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the September 11 terrorist attacks.
 "The next week is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment. It's going to be our 9/11 moment; it's going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives," he said.
 "And we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part," Adams told "Meet the Press" Sunday talk show.
 His remarks came a day after President Donald Trump said that the next week is going to be a "very very difficult" time for the country.
 Members of the White House Task Force on the coronavirus have predicted between 100,000 to 200,000 lakh deaths in the next several week.
 Peak in New York is expected in the next six-seven days, during which US authorities are urging people to strictly enforce the social mitigation measures including social distancing.
 Nearly 95 per cent of the country's 330 million population are under stay-in- home orders.
 "Ninety per cent of Americans are doing their part, even in the states where they haven't had a shelter in place," the Surgeon General said in a passionate plea to his countrymen.
 "I wish every governor would encourage the people in their states to follow these guidelines for 30 days, that's what I want. But I want them to do what they can within their states," he said.
 In addition to declaration of a national emergency, President Donald Trump has notified major disaster declaration in more than 42 of the 50 states.
 "This is going to be a hard week, it's going to test our resolve. It's going to be the hardest week of our lives, but I'm confident based on the numbers in Washington and in California and Italy and in Spain, we can get through this, we will get through this. I know the American people will do the right thing and stay-at-home," Adams said.
 The US armed forces have deployed more than 50,000 of its soldiers, including 1,000 doctors and nurses in the fight against coronavirus.
 They have built or is in the process of building 30 hospitals.
 "We will soon be taking over the Javits Center, a 2,500-bed capacity. To show you how all in we are, the United States military will soon be running the largest hospital in the United States. That shows you our commitment," US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said.
 The US Navy has deployed two of its hospital ships - in New York and Los Angeles - to treat the rush of COVID 19 patients.
 "Whether it's the ships, the field hospitals, or our preparation of eight sites around the country where we built hospitals, another 22 that will come online in the next two weeks, we have stayed ahead of need here. That's factor number one," he said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said California will significantly increase COVID-19 testing capabilities, adding that he "owns" testing lapses in the state that have made it difficult to track the deadly virus.
   
 In a Saturday news conference, Newsom announced a task force that he said will work toward a fivefold increase in daily testing in the state by identifying supply shortages and adding testing locations.
   
 The announcement comes as California continues to see dramatic increases in people hospitalized with the virus, with 2,300 patients in the state. Another 3,267 people hospitalized are suspected of having COVID-19, but are awaiting testing results.
   
 Overnight, the number of coronavirus patients in California's intensive care unit beds rose nearly 11% to 1,008 people.
   
 In all, Newsom said 126,700 people have been tested in California, a state of nearly 40 million people. Of those who have been tested, 13,000 are awaiting results.
   
 "The testing space has been a challenging one for us and I own that," Newsom said. "And I have a responsibility as your governor to do better and do more testing in the state of California."
   
 Public health experts have said widespread testing is crucial to the state's efforts to accurately assess how many people are infected and where the virus is spreading. Testing has lagged across the country, though. For those who have been able to be tested, backlogs in laboratories have led to delays in results, which Newsom said has been equally frustrating.
   
 Newsom announced Saturday that he formed a task force of private and public leaders and said he is confident the group will upend testing challenges in the state.
   
 "We are now in a position where I can confidently say it's a new day," Newsom said.
   
 Newsom said the state is partnering with universities, hospitals, labs and testing companies to increase testing locations across the state, reduce backlogs and ensure there is more accurate and timely data on the number of COVID-19 cases. The newly created task force will be led by Paul Markovich, president and CEO of Blue Shield of California, and Dr. Charity Dean, assistant director of the state Public Health Department.
   
 State officials have been working feverishly to add more hospital and intensive care unit beds to handle the expected surge in coronavirus patients. The state's modeling suggests California will need 50,000 new hospital beds by mid-May. To meet that demand, the state is asking for recently retired medical providers, those with licenses from other states and medical school students to join the newly created California Health Corps.
   
 Newsom said Saturday that a "staggering number of individuals" -- some 79,000 people -- have signed up through the state's health corps website.
   
 The state also is launching a website, covid19supplies.ca.gov, to allow individuals and companies to donate, sell and offer to manufacture essential medical supplies, such as N95 masks and testing materials. Supply shortages have been blamed for inadequate testing in the state, while a lack of masks, gloves and gowns has left critical health care workers unprotected against the virus.
   
 Newsom said that despite the state's difficulty with adequate testing, California has led in other areas, including in its stay-at-home order, which the governor said will continue to remain in place. Newsom has said the order should be enforced through persuasion, not punishment. But he acknowledged that there is enforcement happening throughout the state by local governments.
   
 Los Angeles prosecutors on Friday filed criminal charges against four businesses, accusing the nonessential shops of refusing to close. A paddleboarder was arrested Thursday after ignoring orders from lifeguards to get out of the water on a closed beach.
   
 "The state is always prepared to do more," Newsom said. "And I just want to encourage people, don't force our hand in that respect."
   
 Newsom said he understands that people have been asked to drastically alter their lifestyles and stay indoors.
   
 "We cannot allow cabin fever to come in, we cannot allow people to congregate again in pews, on our beaches and in our parks," Newsom said."Let's hold the line."

ONE of the country’s leading fitness experts has warned GAA players of the dangers of over-training on their own during the shutdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Joe O&rsquo;Connor, who was fitness coach with Clare and Limerick hurlers when they won their All-Ireland titles in 2013 and 2018, believes the absence of collective training presents opportunities and dangers for GAA players.O&rsquo;Connor, who has also worked on the popular RTE Fittest Family show, suggests the best option for players during the lockdown is to &lsquo;train to train&rsquo; – which in layman&rsquo;s language means doing sufficient work to enable them to be able to resume game-specific training when the ban is lifted, without risking injury.Ideally, players would do their work-out in the morning or lunch time and then top up on their nutrition every two hours, just like the professionals do according to O&rsquo;Connor.One of the inherent contradictions in the evening training regime practiced by the vast majority of GAA teams is that while players are advised to eat proteins and carbohydrates afterwards, they are also told not to eat late at night as it is likely to disturb their sleep.Even though the government ordered a virtual lock-down of everything bar essential services, players can still do bodyweight exercises in their homes and without any specialised equipment.&quot;Gyms have been closed down for a couple of weeks but players can still build their strength and power. Despite what a lot of clubs will tell you, you don&rsquo;t need a lot of equipment. I have switched my gym clients to online and put up a video of bodyweight exercises which they can follow.&quot;Of course, if you want to be bigger, faster and stronger you need to be doing your strength and conditioning properly but at times like this, bodyweight exercises will do.&quot;There are upsides to the ban on collective training, according to O&rsquo;Connor. Players will have more time to recover, while those carrying niggling injuries will get an opportunity to allow it to recover properly. The value of rest cannot be over emphasised says O&rsquo;Connor.&quot;I have always said that the difference between professional and amateur athletes is time management and recovery.&quot;Professionals are very good at managing and filling their time when their sport doesn&rsquo;t need them, but they are also exceptionally good at recovering.&quot;By contrast, GAA teams and players have a tendency to do more training when they have more time on their hands. O&rsquo;Connor highlighted cases of squads doing too much physical training during collective training camps.&quot;How many times have we seen teams going on different types of camps and overdoing it, simply because all of a sudden they have exposure to time?&quot;I have never called them training camps I call them regeneration camps. It gives players a chance to get vitamin D on their backs and do technical and tactical work, rather than an opportunity to just do more and more (physical) training.&quot;I&rsquo;m often asked what is the difference between a professional (in sport) and a GAA player. The GAA players train just as hard as the professionals do, but they can&rsquo;t recover as well.&quot;Now, all GAA players – irrespective of whether they play for their county, their club or play camogie – are getting what they always wanted, that is time to rest and recover.&quot;The one warning I would give is that just because you have an opportunity to train by yourself, make sure not to burn yourself into the ground.&quot;And under the new restrictions, you must be within a 2km radius of your home.&quot;For me, going for a run has got very little to do with playing football or hurling. What will be compromised during the shut-down is the game-based conditioning type of training, which can only be done collectively.&quot;It is very hard to replicate game-based scenarios, like somebody putting you under pressure, when you are training on your own.&quot;O&rsquo;Connor, who lectures in exercise physiology and sports nutrition at the Institute of Technology in Tralee, believes that most teams train too hard and the training they do is not specific enough.He suggests that when collective training resumes all teams must be given sufficient time to do the type of conditioning training they need before returning to play.&quot;While players can train their bodies to get ready to train during the break, they cannot replicate the actual training scenarios themselves. They can&rsquo;t go from zero to hero in an instance.&quot;The support staff working with county squads will have given the players work to do during the shut-down.&quot;Their sleep patterns will be monitored and it is important that the players continue to get their nutrition right. &quot;For me, sleep and proper nutrition are absolutely essential for the transition back to training to function properly.&quot;Ideally, players would need two to three weeks of game-based conditioning before they play a game.&quot;This is in the perfect scenario, but once the green light is given there is likely to be fixture congestion and a rush to get competitions finished.&quot;There is a widespread perception that the immune system of those who engage in strenuous exercise may be compromised, which might leave them more prone to the Covid-19 virus. But research suggests otherwise, though the issue is complicated.A key term in exercise physiology is chronic training load (CTL), which according to O&rsquo;Connor describes the amount of exercise undertaken by a footballer or athlete over an extended period.Over time the body&rsquo;s immune system becomes accustomed to this load and adjusts accordingly. However, the body&rsquo;s immune system can become compromised if there is a sudden spike in their CTL.&quot;I fear, for example, that players might decide to be become like professional athletes because they have so more spare time and train three times a day. Then, at the other end of the spectrum, others might opt to stay up half the night watching boxsets because they can do it.&quot;In both cases the players are at significant risk of getting injured when they return to training, particularly if the trainer thinks they all have been doing nothing for a few weeks and goes mad. &quot;The players who were training three times a day have already compromised their immune system and now they are facing another spike in their training load, while they guys who were idle won&rsquo;t be able to handle it either. So this is a worst case scenario.&rdquo;Given that the Covid-19 virus is relatively new and little is known about it, O&rsquo;Connor says it is impossible to estimate how long a player who has contracted the virus and recovered would be out of action for.The message from the expert to GAA players is to continue to train, rest and recovery – just don&rsquo;t overdo it.

You do that sometimes. We’re closing in on 100 years of television. Just hundreds of thousands of episodes. It’s hard to find like a new dynamic, really, between friends or between lovers or between husbands and wives. Once in a while a show does something that’s truly new, I think, with its central relationship. I thought _Broad City_ was like, “This is a new friendship. I’ve never seen this friendship before.” It was so specific, I think because it’s the friendship that those ladies have in real life. But it was just so specific and so modern and so fresh and so interesting that you would just tune in, or at least I would, just to be a fly on the wall of how these two women relate to each other. But usually we don’t have that, so you’re basing it on something.

The sad truth is that extraordinarily low bond yields have produced market valuation out of whack by all measures - the reasonable value of future cash flows, the reasonable acceptance of risk, and the a reasoning person's acceptance of the fact that reaching for yield gets you into things that almost always have hidden problems and will ultimately lead to grief.
 All these factors were in place and in plain sight, but many investors refused to see them. Then along came the coronavirus to expose everything.
 ## Who Are Buffett's Naked Swimmers?
 The short answer: any person or entity with significant debt. Debt pulls the future into the present, putting its cost on the wrong side of the balance sheet. We are in the process of discovering what happens when for any reason the world stops cold.
 Debt was the core fuel for leveraging everything up. With the decline of interest rates everything looked cheap. PE ratios went up in accord with the decline in rates to the point of absurdity. Everyday dividend stocks were worth 25 or more times earnings - more than elite growth stocks had cost in the early 1980s. The problem of servicing debt seemed trivial. Everybody was doing it, from contract workers who lived on a week to week basis at the edge of a maxed credit card to companies to sovereign states.
 If something went wrong, could they survive the next few weeks? No problem, nothing was going wrong. Then came the coronavirus, which would quickly reveal which swimmers were skinny dipping. As soon as investors began to grasp the situation their questions started to change. From "you'll maintain your annual dividend increase, won't you?" the question evolved to, "how many months can you service your debt and avoid bankruptcy?"
 Cruise lines and airlines were near the top of the list with energy stocks and mall REITs following. Those were the usual suspects, but industrial companies which had muddled through hard times in the past soon started to pull their guidance. Consumer staples were safe, though, weren't they? I had never liked them much anyway but it blew my mind when I checked up on McDonald's (MCD) and realized that they had accumulated $39 billion in debt then checked on Coca- Cola (KO) and discovered that it had negative top line growth and had been paying its dividend out of borrowed money.

Now my daughter and wife were at risk. Just that angry feeling. I thought I was really safe, I went out minimally, I was wearing gloves going out but somehow I still contracted it. They called me up and told me I tested positive and they were fantastic. They walked me through what the family needs to do, so one of the big things is for me to let people know who have been around me that I tested positive so that they could then quarantine for 14 days. The progression of the fever, the headaches. The headaches were really bad. Your whole body just feels really dehydrated. The headache just stays with you from when you wake up to when you go to sleep. You take Tylenol, and it helps a little, but it just knocks you off your feet. Whenever I came out to see my wife or baby girl I had to wear a face mask, gloves, thankfully my daughter thought it was funny. Meanwhile my wife and daughter had to be quarantined for 14 days, which ends today. Not that there is anything for us to go out and do, but thankfully we are out of the woods now.”You can watch Colin’s full interview with Lipsky here.Copyright 2020 WECT. All rights reserved.

The head of the Italian footballers' association (AIC) on Sunday urged football authorities in the country to strike a deal to safeguard lower league players, who risk losing their livelihoods due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic.
 "In Lega Pro (which manages the third-tier Serie C), Serie D and women's football there are players who provide for their families with very low earnings," AIC president Damiano Tommasi told Rainews24.
 "We're looking to see if the resources we can get our hands on can help give them some security... 70 percent of players in the Lega Pro have gross earnings of less than 50,000 euros ($54,000) a year."
 "Even going beyond individual athletes, I believe we have a responsibility to protect the kit men, physical therapists, drivers and pitch-side workers."
 Tommasi spoke a day before a videoconference meeting between Serie A clubs in which player salaries -- as well as potential dates to restart the league -- will be on the agenda after failing to strike a deal with the AIC.
 The top-flight outfits had reportedly proposed a four-month suspension of salary payments in line with what Juventus players have already agreed with their club, an idea that was given short shrift by the AIC, who according to newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport counter-proposed a one month stop.
 On Saturday, the president of the Lega Pro Francesco Ghirelli said sides in the division could disappear in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which appeared on Sunday to be slowly abating in Italy but has still killed thousands.
 "With every day that passes, there is a greater risk that entire clubs and companies could be forced out of business," Ghirelli said in a statement.
 "The whole network of Serie C clubs is very close to collapse ... The very real risk is that owners could see their clubs go bankrupt. Players would then find themselves with no club and, consequently, no salary at all.
 "This is why we need sacrifices from everyone to save football. We need to realise as soon as possible that this virus could see many Serie C clubs disappear."

It should come as no surprise that the distribution of funds in this fiscal stimulus package would be an administrative nightmare. Some people will fall through the cracks, because the government can’t locate them or they didn’t file a tax return. Others will be receiving checks in the mail who really don’t need them. Even if you and your wife are still employed and being paid, if your joint income is below $198,000 a year you will receive up to $2,400 plus $500 per child. If you are a worker in the service industry earning well below median income, the unemployment benefits enhanced by $600/week may lead to more income than you earned from the job you lost. The issue is that these payments only last for four months, and the checks are not in the mail yet. Still, this seems like a step in the right direction in aggregate.
 I’m far more concerned about the assistance to the 25-30 million small businesses in the country that have fewer than 500 employees. The $350 billion set aside for this group is woefully inadequate. This sum equates to 350,000 loans at $1 million each. If we assume a smaller loan size of $250,000, then 1.4 million loans would deplete the allocation. There are also only 1800 SBA approved lenders in the country, and most are not going to spend the time and effort to take on new businesses. They will have plenty to do serving their existing customer base, especially when they don’t expect to profit a great deal from this business. Evidently, it takes approximately 14 days on average from the time of application to approval to receive funds.
 My hope is that the Fed’s Main Street Business Lending Program will address the shortfall in the $350 billion stimulus. The Fed intends to use banks as a conduit to funnel short-term loans to small businesses. This program will be funded by the Treasury with up to $454 billion in capital that can then be leveraged to extend up to $4 trillion in credit. This should close the huge gap that exists between the stimulus in place today and demand. This program is expected to be up and running in two weeks.

 What is there to say about the strange place that has become our world?
   
 I saw a man running with a mask along Beal Parkway this week.
   
 I no longer go to stores.
   
 I carry a tiny bottle of hand sanitizer in my pocket, as much for emotional comfort as a physical barrier.
   
 I am home every hour of the day except the brief moments I spend exercising, if you can call it that. I miss swimming. I even miss the gym I rarely went to.
   
 Every day, I find things to be grateful for. Because the next day could be worse and I don't want to waste this one failing to appreciate what I still have.
   
 Sometimes I read about this virus that has left us with nothing to take for granted. Sometimes I study the numbers, trying to predict whether the risk is greater today than it was yesterday, trying to find some small piece of reassurance, feeble though it might be.
   
 Sometimes I don't. Sometimes I realize that the only thing I can do is what I'm already doing.
   
 I stay home, wash my hands, live in a cloud of Lysol, stare at the computer screen and telephone screen that have become my new reality.
   
 My children - all adults - are home. Sometimes I stare at them.
   
 Their world has changed more than mine. They are bursting into bloom, while I'm the old tree in the front yard. I have seen a lot of springs, a lot of summers, a lot of falls and winters too.
   
 I went away to college and lived it fully. I walked across a stage to get my diplomas. I went to my senior prom.
   
 I worked from the day I turned 16.
   
 I left home when it was time to leave home and came back as I needed to on and off for the next 10 years.
   
 My weekends have opened up. Most of the activities are gone. I am trying very hard to be happy about that. In reality, I am mourning.
   
 We never like our lives so much as when they are taken away from us.
   
 The people we love most can be annoying, inconvenient, obtuse. They are too loud or too quiet. They worry too much or not enough.
   
 They are our most precious possessions and they are at risk, too.
   
 The sun is shining. The weather has been kind and benevolent. We are not in hurricane season yet. We have milk in our refrigerator, iced tea in our glasses and toilet paper in our bathrooms.
   
 Throw all those in the grateful box.
   
 There is much to be grateful for if we look hard enough.

On Friday, Marvel Studios announced that _Black Widow_ will open in theaters on November 6th. Marvel intended to release the first film of its Phase 4 slate in May, kicking off the summer movie season. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will instead take the date meant for _The Eternals_ in the fall. _Black Widow_ appears on the cover of the latest interview _Total Film_ , which would have been well-timed with the planned release of the movie. The magazine features an interview with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. Feige hinted that the film will reveal Natasha Romanoff has been busy between appearances in other Marvel Studios films.
 "She has such a rich backstory," Feige says. "We've hinted at it throughout all the other films. But we approach it in a completely unexpected way. She's been up to a lot all along - in between when we see her in the other movies - some of which will be surprising to people."
 Star Scarlett Johansson spoke about the themes of the film during an interview last November. "It's a film about self-forgiveness and it's a film about family," Johansson said. "I think in life we sort of come of age many times and you have these kind of moments where you're in a transitional phase and then you move sort of beyond it and I think in the _Black Widow_ standalone film I think the character is at, when we find her, a moment of real crisis, and throughout the film, by facing herself in a lot of ways and a lot of things that make her, her, she actually kind of comes through that crisis on the other side and we start to be able to reset where she's a more grounded, self-possessed person. So that's her journey, well, I hope anyway."

The energy sector tanked in Q1 2020. WTI and Brent crude oil posted significant losses in Q1 after the outbreak of Coronavirus weighed on demand. The failure of OPEC to respond to the price weakness led to a massive move to the downside in early March that took the price of crude oil to its lowest price since 2002. Oil product prices followed, with gasoline and heating oil moving lower in Q1. The prices of oil and products fell to multiyear lows in Q1 2016 and did the same in Q1 2020.
 In the natural gas market, the peak season of demand starting in November 2019 did little to support the price of the volatile energy commodity. High inventory levels and warm weather during the winter months caused prices to make lower highs and lower lows in late 2019 and throughout Q1 2020. The price of nearby natural gas futures fell to the lowest level since 1995 when the price traded to a low of $1.519 in March 2020. Each attempt at a recovery failed over the first three months of this year as natural gas made lower highs and lower lows. Ethanol declined on the back of losses in oil and gas markets.
 The energy sector of the commodities market will reflect the economic and geopolitical landscapes as we move into Q2, but the price of oil closed the quarter putting in a bearish reversal on the quarterly chart. The Middle East, which is home to more than half the world’s oil reserves, remains the most turbulent region on the earth. At the same time, Venezuela is a political and economic mess, which means the nation with the leading petroleum reserves in the world is not likely to see oil output increase any time soon. When it comes to China, the “ _phase one_ ” trade deal provided some optimism at the start of Q1, but Coronavirus, which began in China and spread around the world, took any bullish winds out of the sails of the market. OPEC cut production at its December meeting, which helped stabilized the price of crude oil in the short-term. However, the failure of the oil cartel to respond to demand problems caused by Coronavirus in March caused a plunge in the price of the energy commodity that sent the price to a multiyear low and its lowest level since 2016. The US is the world’s leading producer of crude oil with a daily output climbing to a new record at 13.10 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration during Q1.

“Some people may be concerned that leaving a feeder up will prevent hummingbirds from migrating in the fall,” the article says. “This is a myth. Hummingbirds (and all migratory birds) have an internal ‘clock’ that tells them when to migrate. No healthy hummingbird would ever stick around just because you’ve left your feeder up in the fall. However, late migrants, young and inexperienced birds, and hummers that are not completely healthy may be helped by the presence of your feeder, especially in areas where blooming flowers are scarce in fall and early winter.”
 Feeders should be cleaned as often as necessary.
 “In areas with daily summer temperatures above about 75 degrees F, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days,” the article says. “If your region has hotter ambient temperatures or your feeders get a lot of direct sunlight, clean them more frequently. Warm soapy water with a bit of gunk-scrubbing should do the trick. Some folks prefer to use white vinegar.”
 Many hummingbirds spend the winter in southern Mexico or Central America. Some birds migrating north to their breeding grounds in the southern U.S. can be seen as early as February.
 According to information about migration on hummingbirds.net, each hummingbird species has its own migration strategy. Banding studies show that migrating hummingbirds tend to return to where they were hatched and visit the same feeders on their migration route each year.
 Dyes and commercial “nectar” mixes are not necessary to attract birds to a feeder, according to the website. A mixture of one part ordinary cane sugar to four parts water approximates the average sucrose content of the flowers favored by North American hummingbirds.

Greg had a theory that if you had an episode that was particularly mushy and romantic, don’t give it to a writer who tends to be more excited about mushy and romantic episodes. Give it to the hard-joke writer who has zero tolerance for mushy romance, because it’s just a counterbalance of, make sure you don’t tilt too far in any one direction. A really good episode of a comedy like _The Office_ has a little romance, it has a lot of hard jokes. It’s got a good plot, it’s got some weird little character moments. So if you have an episode where the main story is pointing in one direction, give it to a writer who has a different specialty so that you don’t go off the deep end. I always felt like the real power of the writer who was fluent in a certain character wasn’t in writing the actual draft, it was in the rewrite process. Because then you’d get to a point in whatever draft it was and say, “OK, we need a better joke for Ann here.” And then someone who was really good at writing for Ann would go like, boom, and there it is.

We have known for some time that this new disease, Covid-19, was not only an older person's disease. It has become clear that the young and healthy are by no means immune to this infection and could become sick enough to require hospitalization.
 In an early snapshot from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for 2,449 patients whose age was known, 18% were between age 45 and 54, and 29% were between 20 and 44 years old. Among those who were hospitalized, 18% were ages 45 to 54 and 20% were ages 20 to 44.
 Younger people are far less likely to die, but there is an unusual pattern that seems to be emerging. As Dr. Anthony Fauci told me, it is what makes the coronavirus such an "unusual disease."
 "I'm fascinated," he said, " ... by what I would call the pathogenesis."
 "You know, you get so many people who do well and then some people who just, bingo, they're on a respirator, they're on ECMO (a cardio-pulmonary machine) and they're dead," Fauci told me when I interviewed him for my podcast, "Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."
 "I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out."
 So, what could be behind it? Scientists and researchers wonder if the answer could lie in our genes and are beginning to try and understand what differentiates people who get mild cases from those who die.
 One possibility is a gene variation in the ACE2 gene. ACE2 is an enzyme that that attaches to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, as well as the heart. In an article in Science magazine, Immunologist Dr. Philip Murphy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that "variations in the ACE2 gene that alter the receptor could make it easier or harder for the virus to get into lung cells."
 It is also possible that a critical ingredient produced by the body, known as surfactant, which better allows the lungs to expand and contract, becomes depleted in some patients infected with the coronavirus. If you think of your lungs as a sponge, surfactant would be the detergent which would make them soft and pliable. Without surfactant, however, your lung becomes stiff and hard to squeeze. It may be why some patients continue to struggle even on a breathing machine.
 Another avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place. In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs. In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well. Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.
 Perhaps it is that some younger healthier people, thinking they are not vulnerable to this disease, have been less diligent about practicing physical distancing, and as a result have been exposed to much larger viral loads from the environment.
 To better define the underlying pathology could still take months, and may be variable in patients, no matter their age. While it is true that a significant percentage of young people may be at increased risk because Americans have such a high baseline rate of pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, it is the perfectly healthy young people, like Ben and Conrad, we need to better understand.
 For now, no matter your age or underlying condition, the advice remains the same. Stay home, wash your hands and reduce your virus exposure as much as possible. Even if you do develop mild symptoms, it is probably best to stay home to recover.
 But if you develop trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in your chest, sudden confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, please, it is time to go to the hospital.

By Mohan Guruswamy Last week, this paper reported several large retail chains such as Reliance Retail, Big Bazaar, McDonald’s and Domino’s Pizza trying to use the force majeure (literally ‘superior force’) clause -- which relieves both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event beyond their control prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their contractual obligations -- to back out of commercial obligations. Typically, these notices are served on smaller associates deemed least able to challenge them. It would be interesting to know what GoI has been told by Reliance or Airtel of their inability to pay telecom spectrum dues. And whether Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman would take kindly to any attempt to diddle his country of payment for oil already processed? It won’t be long before other companies follow suit. Several auto and oil marketing companies operate their own showrooms. Some of our top business groups like the Tatas’ Croma and Westside, and RP-Sanjiv Goenka’s Spencer’s have a strong presence in retail. Companies like Godrej, Samsung and LG have nationwide exclusive networks for their products. These company showrooms are often the anchor stores in a mall or market, with their perceived creditworthiness getting lower rents. Some of them are citing a February 19 letter issued by the finance ministry in relation to the definition of force majeure in the Manual for Procurement of Goods, 2017. This manual is in relation to procurement contracts of GoI for goods and services, and is not applicable to the interpretation of separate force majeure clauses in private contracts. Unlike with government procurement contracts, the performance of the obligation of contractual payments has not been prevented by any act, proclamation, regulation or ordinance of any government or governmental agency. The spread of Covid-19 is undoubtedly a public health crisis, with multiple measures placed by state and central governments. But these orders only cover educational institutions, theatres, function and cinema halls. In any event, Covid-19 cannot be invoked as a reason to escape all contractual obligations in general. 74998859 The spread of the virus, or government regulations formed around its mitigation, has to directly make the performance of a contractual obligation impossible so as to invoke force majeure. The clause in agreements clearly specifies the requirement of prevention or delay ‘by causes beyond the reasonable control of such party, including, but not limited to, any act, proclamation, regulation or ordinance of any government or governmental agency, having jurisdiction over the parties, provided that the affected party takes all reasonable action to eliminate the cause of the delay’. Even if a company claims that it may have become onerous to pay the contracted amount as a result of Covid-19-related notifications, no notification has rendered it impossible for companies to pay for goods and services availed, or being availed of. The ability of a company to generate a monthly profit is not linked to the obligation, or ability, of a profitable public corporation to pay the contracted amount. Despite lockdown notifications, these companies continue using premises for storing goods for present or future sale. For instance, most retail verticals are continuing to take orders and payments online for all postal codes. Even during the national lockdown, unable to complete the delivery of sale, they continue to receive payments for products being stored in their premises. Nothing renders the payment of rent impossible. Any kind of temporary business interruption is covered in the risk insurance these companies are obliged to have. The burden of rent cannot be wriggled out of because of Covid-19-induced reduced business opportunities. With respect to the SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong courts did not permit tenants to wriggle out of their obligations of payment in lease agreements, even when the tenant was not permitted to enter the leased premises due to temporary isolation orders (Li Ching Wing vs Xuan Yi Xiong, 2003). The court held that a 10-day isolation period was insignificant in relation to the two-year lease. And that while SARS was unforeseeable, it did not ‘significantly change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights or obligations’ of the parties in the case. The law states that ‘where the property leased is not destroyed or substantially and permanently unfit, the lessee cannot avoid the lease because he does not or is unable to use the land for purposes for which it is let to him’. Additionally, courts have held that even when the economic conditions are the product of a force majeure event, such financial hardship would not excuse performance if the party retained some level of control over its allocation of resources. All our big companies report significant profits. It is sad that some of them are attempting to wrongfully wriggle out of their contractual obligations in such difficult times, particularly oppressing smaller associates.

Over the past few months, she's felt an irregular heartbeat. She says the last time she felt that, it meant her pacemaker battery was starting to wear out.
 It wasn't an immediately life-threatening problem, and so in November she scheduled appointments on April 17 and April 23 to have tests performed on her pacemaker.
 At the end of March she received a phone call from her cardiologist's office canceling the procedures.
 "It's scary because it makes me realize how reliant I am on a functioning medical system. I took it for granted I've always been around really good care," she said. "It's terrifying to think if anything happened now, it would be completely out of my control."
 Jolene Baxter has the same fear. Her daughter, Marlee, has a congenital heart defect and the right side of her heart doesn't work.
 Marlee had three open heart surgeries before her second birthday. Now she's 3 years old and was doing well until a few weeks ago when her oxygen saturation numbers -- a measure of the amount of oxygen in the blood -- started to dip.
 "I want to know the reason why they're low because they haven't been for two years, and now they are," she said.
 In early March, her pediatric cardiologist in Oklahoma scheduled Marlee to have a heart catheterization on March 17, but the day before, his office called to cancel it and said they didn't know when it would be rescheduled.
 In Oklahoma, there's an executive order to postpone all elective surgeries.
 Baxter measures her daughter's oxygen levels several times a day and hopes that all will be well until the pandemic passes.
 "It's a very, very scary time," she said.

Dalglish’s remodelled side of 1987/88 took a vice-like grip on that season’s title race in the early months of autumn and never looked likely to let it go.


  Playing a stylish brand of football thanks to new signings John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Ray Houghton and John Aldridge which saw them compared to great Brazilian sides of the past, the Reds strolled through the first 29 league games of the season unbeaten making what would become the club’s 17th championship a mere formality.


  By the time United rocked up at Anfield on Easter Monday, title confirmation was just weeks away but Liverpool were without a home win against the Old Trafford side in nearly nine years, with Ferguson’s men having also been able to take points off the all-conquering Reds earlier in the season with a 1-1 draw in Manchester.


  Sure enough, Bryan Robson scored within three minutes to indicate Liverpool could be in for another tough afternoon against a club who often seem to reserve their best performances for such high-octane occasions but by half time goals from Beardsley and Gary Gillespie had put Dalglish’s men in front.


  When Steve McMahon thundered home a third from outside the box immediately after the interval and United were reduced to ten men when midfielder Colin Gibson received his marching orders, it seemed the Reds’ glorious season would be adorned with a victory to treasure over their rivals from down the East Lancs Road.

Dave Kaemmer is the co-founder of both Papyrus and iRacing. The veteran programmer recalls having a conversation with Labonte that resulted in pages of data that went into future builds of the NASCAR Racing series.
 "I remember sitting down with Bobby back in the mid- to late '90s," Kaemmer told Autoweek. "I don't remember exactly where or when, but what I remember most is that he talked us around all the Cup tracks, giving us a lot of detail about the reference points drivers would use, the track surfaces, the preferred lines they would run, and how the races tended to progress at each track.
 "He also told us how the tracks that we had built differed from real life: corner radius too tight, too little or too much banking, the way the corner entries worked; did you tend to climb into the corners or fall into them."
 This is before laser scanning tracks became the norm, mind you.
 "I think it might have been as far back as when we were working on NASCAR Racing 2, which would have been around 1995," Kaemmer said. "But it might have been when we were starting NASCAR Racing 4, which was based on the GPL engine. That would have been more like 1999. I just remember that he loved the sim, even way back then, and was just so excited to help us."

CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted the sentence of a suburban Chicago man with cancer who was serving four years in prison for ordering 42 pounds of chocolate infused with the main psychoactive component in marijuana.
 Illinois Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lindsey Hess said Thomas Franzen was released Monday from the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, the Aurora-Beacon News reported. Hess added that the Montgomery man was ordered to complete two years of parole.
 Franzen’s attorney David Camic said the man's family was thrilled about his release.
 “It would be easy to complain and say that the governor took too long (to pardon his sentence), but realistically in the midst of all that is going on with the coronavirus, we are grateful the governor took the time to release him,” said Camic, adding that Franzen, 37, now lives with his father in Sugar Grove.
 U.S. Postal Service workers had noticed questionable packages routinely being delivered to Franzen and opened one in February 2014 that contained the THC- infused chocolate.
 After being initially charged with drug conspiracy and pot trafficking, Franzen was sentenced to four years for a lesser charge of possessing more than 5,000 grams of marijuana in June 2019. Franzen pleaded guilty a day before Illinois voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana.
 Franzen has battled several forms of cancer since he was in high school, Camic said, adding that he used the drugs to self-medicate. Franzen had been diagnosed with testicular cancer that spread to his abdomen, both lungs, around his aorta and a vocal cord.
 Franzen’s family said his health was deteriorating while behind bars for the last nine months and noted that he didn't receive proper medical care. The family's concerns about Franzen’s health increased amid the coronavirus pandemic. At least one person at the Stateville prison has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
 The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.
 Pritzker has announced plans to release several low-level, non-violent offenders through a rigorous vetting process.

The rise of the US has caused the influence of OPEC to decline dramatically. OPEC has attempted to flood the world with the energy commodity in the past but failed on each attempt. This time, a confluence of events including Coronavirus, weak fundamentals for debt-laden oil companies, and the US election could have encouraged another try to chase marginal oil producers from the market. It appears that the Saudis and Russians are willing to take some medium-term financial pain to push the US out of the leadership role. Time will tell if they succeed, this time.
 Iran continues to be a clear and present danger in the Middle East. Sanctions on the theocracy in Teheran took effect in November 2018. The US is attempting to choke the Iranian economy if they do not abandon their quest for nuclear weapons. Iran retaliated against the sanctions often during 2019 with attacks on oil tankers, and on Saudi production. The most severe incident came in mid- September with the drone attack on Saudi oil infrastructure. On January 8, hostilities reach another high between the US and Iran, but the situation calmed throughout the rest of the quarter leading to the price carnage in oil in early March.
 The three dominant oil producers in the world are the Saudis, Russians, and the United States. It is in the best interest of all three nations for the oil price to remain at a level that is high enough to allow oil and profits, but low enough to keep inflationary pressures in check. The US, Russia, and the Saudis are likely engaged in talks in some fashion, behind the scenes, to determine the global price of the energy commodity. Whether OPEC continues or ceases to exist, the influence of the three leading producers, two of which are not cartel members, has eaten away at the power of the cartel. Over the past two years, Qatar and Ecuador left the cartel. With the US election on the horizon in 2020, President Trump is walking a fine line. He has not been shy about encouraging OPEC and Russia to allow the price of oil to fall. However, a decline like we witnessed in March is devastating to the US oil sector and will cause a significant number of job losses over the coming months and going into the election.

The health ministry data showed that 357 people died from COVID-19 in hospitals, compared with 441 in the previous 24 hours, taking the total toll in hospitals to 5,889. The ministry added that 2,189 people had died in nursing homes since March 1, taking France's total death toll to 8,078. France on Sunday reported 357 coronavirus deaths in hospital in 24 hours, the lowest daily increase in a week, bringing the country's toll to 8,078. The tally included 5,889 patients who died in hospital and 2,189 people in old age homes and other medical facilities, a government statement said. It said there were now 28,891 people with coronavirus in hospital in France -- up 748 from the day before -- with 6,978 in intensive care -- a daily increase of 140 which was also the lowest number in days. France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper. There have been 70,478 confirmed coronavirus cases in France, but this is not the total as testing for the virus is not universal. As the country basked in warm sunshine on Sunday and the Easter holiday period started, officials urged people to continue heeding the lockdown rules. Police checks continued as people around the country were observed flouting restrictions to jog in groups, gather in green spaces and allow children to play together as rural areas received holidaymakers contrary to the government's confinement orders. 'The end of confinement is not yet on the cards, a deadline has not been set,' interior ministry number two Laurent Nunez stressed. 'I remind you of the rule... one goes out only when it is strictly necessary.' 'It's the holidays, the weather is nice, don't give in to the temptation,' urged Valerie Pecresse, president of the larger Paris Ile-de-France region, which is hardest hit by the pandemic. Forty-one severely ill patients were evacuated Sunday from Ile- de-France's overflowing hospitals and brought to Brittany in the north in two specially-equipped high-speed trains. In total, more than 550 patients have so far been evacuated from Ile-de-France and the east of France which was the first pandemic hotspot.

Describing the upcoming period of the coronavirus pandemic as a "Pearl Harbor" and a "9/11 moment" for the US, the country's top doctor on Sunday warned this week is going to be the hardest and the saddest one for most Americans. His warning came as the number of people infected people in the US has exceeded 300,000, with the death toll climbing past 9,000; more than 4,000 of those deaths are in the New York state.
 Surgeon General Vice Admiral Jerome Adams said the coronavirus pandemic rivals some of the darkest moments in US history, including the two worst foreign attacks on American soil: the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the September 11 terrorist attacks. "The next week is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment. It's going to be our 9/11 moment; it's going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives," he said. "And we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part,” Adams told “Meet the Press” Sunday talk show.
 His remarks came a day after President Donald Trump said that the next week is going to be a “very very difficult” time for the country. Members of the White House Task Force on the coronavirus have predicted between 100,000 to 200,000 lakh deaths in the next several week. Peak in New York is expected in the next six-seven days, during which US authorities are urging people to strictly enforce the social mitigation measures including social distancing. Nearly 95 per cent of the country’s 330 million population are under stay-in-home orders. "Ninety per cent of Americans are doing their part, even in the states where they haven't had a shelter in place," the Surgeon General said in a passionate plea to his countrymen. “I wish every governor would encourage the people in their states to follow these guidelines for 30 days, that's what I want. But I want them to do what they can within their states,” he said. In addition to declaration of a national emergency, President Donald Trump has notified major disaster declaration in more than 42 of the 50 states. "This is going to be a hard week, it's going to test our resolve. It's going to be the hardest week of our lives, but I'm confident based on the numbers in Washington and in California and Italy and in Spain, we can get through this, we will get through this. I know the American people will do the right thing and stay-at-home,” Adams said. The US armed forces have deployed more than 50,000 of its soldiers, including 1,000 doctors and nurses in the fight against coronavirus. They have built or is in the process of building 30 hospitals. "We will soon be taking over the Javits Center, a 2,500-bed capacity. To show you how all in we are, the United States military will soon be running the largest hospital in the United States. That shows you our commitment,” US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said. The US Navy has deployed two of its hospital ships - in New York and Los Angeles \- to treat the rush of COVID 19 patients. “Whether it's the ships, the field hospitals, or our preparation of eight sites around the country where we built hospitals, another 22 that will come online in the next two weeks, we have stayed ahead of need here. That's factor number one,” he said.

Good to further remember is that the move to the low-twenties late 2018 coincided with a very fierce and brief sell-off in the wider market, down 20% from the recent highs at the time, as I was deploying capital elsewhere. Shares have seen a nice rebound, more or less settling around the $30 mark now, as it is time to review some recent events.
 ## What Happened?
 Last year was a year of simplifying the business and actually delivering on some divestitures to shore up the balance sheet. In May the company sold Italian-based Gelit to a local Italian investment company. The company furthermore sold the Direct Store Delivery snacks business at undisclosed terms, and early 2020 closed on the sale of the Lender's Bagel business.
 In February of this year the company essentially gave a profit warning for the year, seeing fiscal 2020 organic sales between flat and 0.5% growth. Adjusted operating margins were seen at 16%, plus or minus 20 basis points, which all should result in earnings per share of $2.00-$2.07 per share, adjusted earnings those are.
 On the final day of March, in the midst of the Coronavirus crisis, the company reported third quarter results which revealed a 5.6% fall in reported sales and a 1.7% fall on an organic basis. Of course these results do not include the "positive" impact of the hoarding, yet the fourth quarter is going well, as the company expects to achieve or exceeds its recently revised full year outlook on all the important metrics.
 On the bright side is that retained earnings and divestitures have reduced the net debt load to $9.9 billion. The company reports a trailing adjusted EBITDA number of $2.06 billion which is in line with the EBITDA number seen late 2018, making that leverage ratios have fallen below the 5 times, coming in at 4.8 times to be more precise.
 So basically the company has lived up to its expectations, as predicted in 2018, as I noted near term earnings of $2 per share, with great execution allowing for higher earnings down the road, as the company has made some progress with addressing the leverage situation, although leverage ratios remain high.

Most musicians thrive on the experience of performing before a live audience. On a good night, the energy streaks like shooting stars from the players to the listeners. And on a great night, the sparks are multiplied and turned back toward the music makers until a circle of flame, love and joyful abandon is formed, erasing the stress and cares of the outside world for a few glorious hours.


  A well-made cocktail may enhance this phenomenon.


  Enter COVID-19.


  For the first time in the lives of most Americans, venues where live music was once cultivated and shared — from neighborhood pubs to majestic concert halls — have been shut down.


  One day they were open, their stages churning. The next, they were empty, silent.


  "I’m a people person," said Jon English, founder and lead singer of Orphan Jon & The Abandoned, a national-touring blues band out of Bakersfield that not only lost local and regional performance dates following the coronavirus shutdown, but also was forced to postpone their annual spring tour through the Midwest, a road trip they've booked since the release of their debut album “Abandoned No More” on Rip Cat Records.


  "I love the contact, the interactions with friends and fans and club owners, and their staffs, too," English said. "There’s a unique relationship there that I don’t think one can find or experience unless you’re a musician, pouring your heart and soul out to those listening and watching during a gig."


  English and a slew of his fellow musicians in Bakersfield are responding to this unprecedented reality by turning to social media and other forms of digital communication to connect with fans, supporters and maybe even make new connections.


  "I wouldn’t say I was shocked about the gigs getting canceled or moved, but it was more of a let down because I just enjoy being in front of people performing," said August Young, lead singer with the Aviators, but who also performs with Mr. Jimmy's Led Zeppelin Revival Band and works as a single-act as well.


  Unfortunately, the shutdown has crashed his monthly income, as music is his full-time job, both in Kern County and on tour across the country.


  "If I’m not performing or recording then I’m not making money," he said. "Now, I have been saving up for emergencies over the years and my wife works from home so we aren’t totally dead in the water, but it's still a big inconvenience when you’re not bringing in any money."


  So he decided to get on Facebook and start offering live acoustic shows to friends and fans.


  Call them quarantine concerts, virus videos, or pandemic performances. Whatever you call them, they're spreading like a musical wildfire.


  Vince Galindo, as both a single act and with his band Country Deluxe, leans heavily toward traditional country. But when venues for live music were shuttered, Galindo redoubled his efforts to connect with fans through Facebook Live.


  "It's really about lifting people up. It's about giving something to the people, to anyone who wants to listen," Galindo said.


  Like just about everybody else, Galindo dresses more casually for shows in front of the phone cam than he does for shows before audiences that happen to be in the same room with him.


  It's not unusual for him to greet fans as they enter the virtual concert space. It makes people feel good when they are recognized. And just like a regular performance, he takes requests.


  "There are people out there who want to hear live music," Galindo said. "You have to adapt."


  It's an adjustment to be sure. There's no buzz of the crowd. No huddled energy. And when the song ends, there's no applause — except for the flocks of colored emojis that silently float upward across the screen of his smart phone.


  Galindo admits he's never been that great at stage banter, but virtual performances demand it. And he thinks his Whiskey Wednesday shows are helping to hone that aspect of his craft.


  Being able to read the comments coming in from the live, yet virtual audience is a "crucial component," said Abandoned guitarist Brett Cox.


  Why? So the musicians can welcome new fans arriving to the show, and react to their comments and song requests. These shows may have less energy exchanged, but they are interactive.


  English and Cox, dressed casually, relax on a backyard patio as English lets viewers know what's on his mind, and what's happening regarding future plans for live shows and recordings.


  Most performers include information about how listeners can drop a tip in the virtual tip jar, through Venmo or another pay service.


  If people feel inclined to tip, they can do so through the provided link on the video, Young said. But he doesn't want to ask for tips.


  "I’ve never been that kind of person," he said. "In fact the first show I did, I told people the reason there is no virtual tip jar is because we are all hurting for money right now and I just wanted to do this for any and all who wanted to listen. However, people kept asking for me to put one up, so I did and I’m grateful for their generosity."


  Bass player and guitarist Gary Rink, who plays with six or more bands on a rotating schedule, has also had to rethink how he spends his days now that the performance venues and events that normally keep him active at night have dried up, and Bakersfield Sound Co., the music store he helped found, has closed, except for curbside pickup and delivery.


  The music lessons he schedules with students have all moved to video.


  "It was scary; it was rough," Rink said of the abrupt closure of all live performance spaces. "And for a workaholic like me, I'm not used to downtime."


  He knew he would go stir crazy if he didn't come up with a challenging alternative.


  He's always written a lot of songs — he estimates he writes about half the original music for Therese & the Sweetness, one of the bands he performs with — and some of those songs "don't have homes."


  Rink is writing, recording, and filming the making of a series of songs during quarantine, all done on an iPad for audio and an iPhone for video. He programs the drums and plays all the parts on a variety of guitars and bass guitars, then edits to show how the song is built, one part at a time.


  It's not live, but it's highly polished and the process and music draws amazed responses from viewers.


  "I treat it like a job," Rink said. "I get up, shower, put on clothes, just like I'm going to work. I'm equally as busy as I was pre-quarantine."


  Rather than viewing the quarantine as only a negative, Rink sees it as an opportunity.


  "It it wasn't for this quarantine, it just never would have been possible," he said.


  Yes, there's a "dark, looming shadow" hanging over us. But there's a bright side, too.


  "I tell my music students, 'You'll never have this much time to practice again. You've been given a gift of time and contemplation.'"


  And when this is all over, many musicians in Bakersfield may find that they've risen to another level of skill or virtuosity.


  They'll call it the quarantine factor.

North America is anticipated to lead the global RFID readers market in the long run due to high deployment in the automotive sector. RFID enabled system for truck, bus, trailer and passenger vehicle makes tire inspection procedures easy, fast, precise, and facilitates instant reporting. The benefits are life cycle management, multiple uses, no paper or manual errors and improved inspection of the vehicle tyre. For instance, Michelin Americas truck Tires which is a division of Michelin North America, Inc. and manufacturer of vehicle tires added RFID technology to Michelin commercial truck tires. The addition of RFID to tires provides benefits such as road safety, self- inspections, and shows in depth tire summary including critical analysis of tire health.
