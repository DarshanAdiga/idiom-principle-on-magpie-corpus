Rust has covered parts of the tanker and the inert gas that prevents the tanks from gathering inflammable gases, has leaked out.

When President Obasanjo mandated El-Rufai to return Abuja to its original design, he meant it. When the former FCT Minister articulated his work plan, it was without a hidden agenda. When the President approved the plan, he backed it up with the might of his office. When the Minister began to execute his plans, he was blind to ‘power and might’; just as he was not unduly swayed by sentiments of ‘protecting the poor’. There was a job to do and it was done. After initial protests, the poor and the rich who were negatively impacted calmed down owing to the degree of honesty of purpose that went into ‘reclaiming’ Abuja. There was no need for citizens to second guess the government. They respected the hard choices that had to be made. This is the beauty of leadership and citizenship working in tandem.It is not always as straight forward as this. But we can get it right again if we try.

The case for Volkswagen as a strategic buyer, on the other hand, is dubious as well. While among most car manufacturers the transformation into "mobility providers" is the talk of the town right now, the fact is that so far there is not even proof that this is a financially viable business model for a company that actually produces cars. Even Tesla Inc. (TSLA) - which is widely hailed as the car company of the future (although, if you ask me, the current valuation is debatable, to say the least) - has a rather classic business model.
 So, all in all, I believe that there are far better/more important areas for Volkswagen to spend its money on rather than repurchasing Europcar. And even if there were none, I would still argue for returning it to shareholders either in the form of dividends or buybacks instead.

Nigeria is not hard to govern. All that is required is a focused leader with a sense of purpose. As Minister in charge of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), between 2003 and 2007, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai quite easily demonstrated this fact. He fought executive lawlessness to a complete standstill in the way he ran his office to achieve his mandate to restore Abuja to its pristine concept. What that says is that it is not difficult to get Nigerians to rally round a cause or a leader and take pride in the country the moment they see some measure of sincerity of purpose.Two past initiatives readily come to mind in this regard, namely _Operation Feed the Nation (OFN)_ and the _War Against Indiscipline (WAI),_ both of which were implemented by military governments in the late 70s and early 80s.

Stimulus funding was vital to
   
 keep Jacksonville nonprofits afloat
   
 The Jacksonville City Council recently passed an ordinance sent to them by Mayor Lenny Curry that allocated over $16 million to 77 for-profit and nonprofit organizations in Duval County.
   
 This designation of CARES Act funding to organizations negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus was in recognition of the jobs, economic contributions and social impacts provided by these organizations.
   
 Everyone has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus. Nonprofits saw their fundraising efforts dry up as corporate sponsors were focused and foundation funding was narrowly allocated to direct services to individuals. Both of these are understandable.
   
 But without the farsighted funding such as that recommended by the mayor and approved by the City Council it is entirely possible that Jacksonville would have climbed out of the pandemic and then realized that many nonprofits were out of business when their programs and services were most needed.
   
 Junior Achievement is in the business of helping young people prepare for their future. We applaud the mayor and City Council for exhibiting foresight and allocating funding to keeping nonprofits in business as we weather the storm so that they are here tomorrow.

 Meanwhile, this elderly voter is very much alive. But I have not received my CARES Act relief check. Why? Apparently the U.S. Treasury does not know how to access Social Security data on living people, as well.

 “It will be difficult for the others to match us in the future because Bayern is well equipped for the future, even in this coronavirus crisis,” Hoeness told _Blickpunkt Sport_ .
 Each of the last eight Bundesliga titles has ended in the hands of the Allianz Arena club, who have seen the crown surrendered elsewhere on only six occasions since 1999.
 Some critics have suggested that the apparent inevitability of their victories is making the Bundesliga boring, but Hoeness is not concerned.
 “You can’t expect people at Bayern Munich to work only half a day to make the Bundesliga exciting again,” he said, stating that the direct competition “just need to make more effort” in order to make the title race more engrossing.
 Schalke, meanwhile, are reportedly ready to introduce a voluntary salary cap within their club in order to mitigate any effects of the Covid-19 crisis, which saw clubs in Germany go nearly three months without competitive football and return with matches behind closed doors.
 Hoeness, though, is more bullish about the future and says Bayern will not go down a similar path.

_Ilford manager Jon Fowell during Redbridge vs Ilford, Essex Senior League Football at Oakside Stadium on 10th January 2020_
 The former Clapton boss made his intentions clear to the Foxes board a few months back that he wanted to take some time out but wanted to take some time to decide.
 After long conversations with chairman Adam Peek and being offered a few different roles within the club he felt he can’t give what he believes he needs to make the team successful.
 Fowell played an instrumental part of helping move the club out of relegation trouble last season and created a good team that will hopefully push on this season.
 Ilford have left the door open for Jon to return if he decided to and he will still be apart of the club even if not there.
 “I would like to thank Adam, Darren, Aaron, Lisa (my lovely wife who has been supportive), Steve, Michael and all the players for their hard work and support in the time I have been at the club,” Fowell said.

Even before the corona shock, Europcar was facing obvious financial difficulties. 2019 net profit declined 72.8 percent YoY. Almost all blocks of cost rose faster than revenue (+3.2 percent), with fleet holding cost (+6.5 percent) increasing the most. Weak profit margins have been a problem with Volkswagen overall for a while (the Porsche and Skoda brands being notable exceptions). The addition of Europcar would fit that pattern.
 It should not be forgotten either that the real cost of an acquisition would not only consist of the price paid for the equity, but also include a substantial debt component. As of March 31st, the company had slightly above €1 billion in net debt. The figure has likely grown since given the ongoing pandemic.
 ## Added Complexity
 The (re-)integration of Europcar would also add additional complexity to the group. There are already various "new mobility" offerings within the group, including MOIA ride sharing and classical car sharing under the WeShare brand. With Europcar, there would also be classic car rental operations under various brands, as well as another car sharing concept in the form of Ubeeqo. It would not be easy to condense this mix into a stringent and cost-efficient operation. Doing so would also have the potential to divert attention away from the far more important manufacturing business. After all, the wish to concentrate on the core business was the primary motivation to sell Europcar in the first place.
 The structure of Europcar's fleet would not be too helpful, either. As of now, the company obviously employs not only Volkswagen group brands. It would probably not make too much sense for Volkswagen to own a division that is an important customer of its direct rivals in its core business. Admittedly, that could be rectified fairly soon given the short average holding period of a rental car. And arguably, a fleet that relies on only a small number of technical platforms might have advantages in terms of efficiency. That, however, does not change the fact that Volkswagen would essentially be selling to itself. While this would boost the number of unit shipments on paper, it does not really help the bottom line.

It was simply because it was in the context of public health regulations, the risk because of the number of people in attendance.  Because we were in a position that no more than six people could be gathered that regulation had primacy over the right to protest.  In any other circumstance police would’ve been there supporting and facilitating the right to protest.

HARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV) - With a hot weekend in-store and the heat of the summer not too far behind, you can’t forget about your pets. Some of the signs of overheating might not be obvious.It is typical for dogs to pant when they are hot but vets say if the panting rate starts to quicken and become repetitive, that’s when heat issues begin to happen. A dog will also try to find shade to cool down.A local veterinarian said if the dog starts acting uncoordinated or just lays on the ground. Heat illness is already occurring.“Like a person that’s had heat stroke, they get very mentally disoriented. The dog may start to act that way where they just have a very dull attitude,” says Dr. Garrett Smith, a veterinarian from Ashby Animal Clinic.Other things to consider with dogs is preventing burned paws Smith said.“A good kind of rule of thumb would be if you would be reluctant to walk on it with your bare feet, then it would probably be a good idea to avoid it as best you can with your dog,” Smith said.Copyright 2020 WHSV.

Gold prices steadied on Monday, within
 striking distance of last week's near eight-year high and on
 track for their biggest quarterly rise in more than four years,
 as a spike in global coronavirus cases unnerved investors.
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,769.77 per ounce
 by 1148 GMT, but only $9.30 shy of its highest since Oct 2012
 hit last Wednesday.
 U.S. gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,784.40 per ounce.
 Cases of the coronavirus have soared in the United States,
 with California ordering bars to close and Washington state
 pausing plans for re-opening the economy. Infection rates also
 remain on the rise in countries such as Brazil and India.
 "The catalyst (for gold to reach $1,800 an ounce) is already
 here. Rising cases in the U.S. and concerns about a second wave
 in Europe and Asia are likely to slow down any potential rebound
 in the economy and that's going to make gold an asset class that
 is very much in demand," said Michael Hewson, chief market
 analyst at CMC Markets UK.
 He attributed Monday's slight price decline to profit-taking
 going into month and quarter end.
 The relentless spread of the coronavirus has curbed optimism
 for a swift recovery of the global economy, sending world shares
 to a two-week low.
 However, Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial
 services firm AxiCorp said a lack of inflation posed a difficult
 question for the gold rally.
 "Given inflation is headed lower in both the short- and
 medium-term, gold needs (real bond) yields to continue to fall
 this year."
 SPDR Gold Trust , holdings rose 0.3% to 1,178.90 tonnes
 on Friday, while speculators increased their bullish positions
 in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to June 23.
 Palladium rose 1.6% to $1,889.65 per ounce, while
 platinum gained 2.2% to $808.10 per ounce and silver
 was up by 0.6% to $17.85 per ounce.

"I feel super comfortable kicking from distance. Obviously, we're not going to be kicking field goals from [77 yards] most likely in a game, but it's going to help me a lot when it's a 55-yarder, wind's in your face in January and February. That's what I'm training for, to be able to make those kicks."
 Butker has been a success since joining the Chiefs in the middle of the 2017 season, when he was signed off the practice squad of the Carolina Panthers. He made a game-winning 43-yard field goal with four seconds remaining on a Monday night against Washington in his NFL debut. He made 23 straight field goals at one point that season.
 His longest field goal until late last season was a 54-yarder in 2018 against the Seattle Seahawks. He matched that last season against the Vikings on a day that then-Chiefs punter Dustin Colquitt, who served as Butker's holder, called one of the trickiest of his career because of the wind.
 "For kicking, in general, it's hard to do that on days like [that]," Colquitt said of Butker, who also made a 44-yarder on the game's final play to give the Chiefs a three-point victory. "He stuck with it, kept his head down, hit two big kicks for us."
 His success on kicks like that have the Chiefs warming to the idea of allowing Butker to attempt longer kicks, like the one he made at Soldier Field.
 "It was a great kick," special teams coordinator Dave Toub said of Butker's 56-yard field goal in Chicago. "To do that in Soldier Field -- I mean, the weather wasn't brutal, but it wasn't perfect, either. It was really impressive, what he did. That's going to help him as far as confidence goes and going forward into the playoffs, that being the longest one that he has made in a game. He's done a lot longer in practice. But in a game situation, that was his best. That was impressive."
 Butker has shown leg strength during in-game kickoffs. He hit an 80-yard kickoff last year in the playoffs against the Texans, a kick that was tied for longest in the NFL in 2019. Butker said he was better prepared to make longer kicks than he was when he joined the Chiefs.

It was an emotional Jurgen Klopp that reflected on the Reds’ title success on Thursday night.
 “I’m completely overwhelmed,” he told _Sky Sports_ , his voice breaking as he spoke. “I never thought it would be like this – I had no idea!”
 Klopp had been with his players when the moment finally came. Sat on a terrace at the Formby Hall golf resort, near to his home, he watched as Manchester City came up short against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.
 Defeat for Pep Guardiola’s side means Liverpool have wrapped up the Premier League title with seven games to spare – perhaps the most comprehensive title success of all time.
 Their dominance has been absolute. Nobody, but nobody, could question the Reds’ supremacy this season. They are the most deserving of champions.
 For Klopp and his team, the next few weeks are to be enjoyed. They will start their parade with, of all things, a trip to the Etihad Stadium on Thursday, and know that 15 points from those final seven games will see them set a new all-time record points total for a top-flight season.
 It is not just success that is coming their way, it is history.
 The moment should be savoured, for sure. How could it not, after three decades of longing and hoping and wondering if it would ever come their way again?
 But within Anfield, thoughts will already be turning towards the next challenge. They have got to the top, now can they stay there?
 It was Ronnie Moran who used to set the tone whenever Liverpool won a league title in the glory days of the 1970s and 80s.
 Moran, a fierce taskmaster and a man steeped in the club’s tradition, was the one who would hand out the medals at the end of each season.
 A big job, no? Not for ‘Bugsy’. Instead, the legend goes, he would enter the changing room with a cardboard box and casually throw the medals at those who had earned them, with a simple message.
 “See you next season.”
 It may be an extreme example, but that was the mentality of the club in those days. Enjoy yourselves, yes, but do not lose sight of the bigger picture. The most important success is the next one.
 Klopp uses the word “greedy” a lot when describing his team. He speaks of their hunger and their desire and their attitude, and it is that elite mentality which has enabled them, as much as their skill and their athleticism and their coaching, to roar away from the chasing pack this season.

Portugal's Navalrocha Shipyard is reporting a flurry of activity in 2020 as it successfully navigates the COVID-19 outbreak and prepares for a packed order book in the coming months. Navalrocha commercial director Sergio Rodrigues said the shipyard had recorded several landmarks during a highly memorable period in its history - completing its first multi-million Euro refit for a seismic survey vessel before managing its first BWTS (Ballast Water Treatment System) installation.      The standout projects were accompanied by a series of other deals involving bunker tankers, cruise vessels, tugboats, four-masted schooners and catamaran leisure yachts. Further dockings scheduled in the coming months include three container vessels, two cruise ships, a chemical tanker and a research vessel.      "In these extraordinary times Navalrocha continues to be active and operational," said Mr Rodrigues. "We are carefully navigating our way through the pandemic to ensure our shipyard remains safe, healthy and open for business in order to provide our clients with fast, reliable and efficient ship repair solutions. Following several landmark projects in the first half of 2020 we are now looking to the future with optimism and a busy order book for the third and fourth quarters of the year. While these are uncertain times our sights remain firmly fixed on remaining active and driving growth in key markets. Our order book for the second half of 2020 involves a steady stream of projects including three high profile BWTS installations, as we further cement our position as a specialist in this area.      "In terms of key growth markets, Navalrocha is also enjoying significant success in the research vessel and tugboat sectors. Our yard is increasingly well placed to cater for the LPG, product carrier and small-scale LNG markets due to its proximity to major Portuguese ports including Sines, Leixoes and Aveiro, while our competitive rates, fast turnaround times, reliability and growing track record place us in strong stead to capitalise on this expanding market. Meanwhile, 'out of season' cruise sector work involving widescale refurbishments present large opportunities, alongside the fast-expanding domestic livestock carrier market, where we have built an extensive track record."      Navalrocha's first project in 2020 involved a multi-million Euro refit for Dubai-based marine geophysical company Polarcus. The yard worked on the ultra- modern 14 streamer 3D/4D seismic vessel - Polarcus Naila, which is amongst the most environmentally advanced seismic vessels in the world - involving mechanical, hydraulic, piping, steel work, blasting and painting as well as oil, fuel and ballast tank cleaning, carpentry and welding. Around 350 engineers were involved in the contract which required careful management of high-value survey equipment.      "The Polarcus project helps highlight one of our yard's significant advantages, which is the scale of our graving docks," said Mr Rodrigues. "This opens the door to many more projects involving seismic survey vessels and ships with similar dimensions such as OSVs, PSVs and AHTs. The deal came shortly after we delivered our first ever BWTS project for the Paxoi bunker tanker capping off a highly memorable period in the shipyard's history."      In late January Navalrocha welcomed the Ice Lady Patagonia II catamaran sailing yacht for a 7-day repair project involving work to propeller shafts and the rudder system as well as scraping and high pressure washing to the hull. This followed an underwater inspection from a team of divers. Another standout project in early 2020 involved the Santa Maria Manuela sailing vessel which underwent a reclassification in Dock 2. The 19-day project saw a range of work carried out including blasting, painting, mechanical work, piping and tank treatment.      February saw the arrival of the Andros bunker tanker, managed by MM Marine Inc - which operates one of the world's largest fleets of high-specification bunkering tankers. The Andros docked for 15 days where Navalrocha worked alongside its in-yard partner Step Consolidated to install an Alfa Laval Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS). "In order to maximise speed and efficiency our engineers fabricated new pipes before the vessel arrived after requesting 3D CAD drawings from the vessel management team," said Mr Rodrigues. "Pre-fabrication work involved anti-corrosion treatment with the application of zinc coating through deep carbonization."      In Spring, Navalrocha docked the Castelo de Sines tugboat operated by Rebonave for reclassification. Work involved blasting, repair work to the propulsion system and full-scale painting. This project was followed by the arrival of two ocean tugs through a new contract with Dutch operator ALP Marine Services. ALP is a specialist in Ocean Towing, Offshore Positioning and Mooring of Floating Platforms, Heavy Transport and Salvage operations. Both the ALP Winger and ALP Centre arrived in tandem berthing in Dock 1 and 2. Navalrocha made special arrangements investing in large machinery and chain blocks to accommodate the heavy 30-tonne vessels. Work included the replacement of three propeller shafts and rudder blades along with painting, blasting and mechanical services.      Moving into early Summer, Navalrocha completed a pier side project for the SeaDream II Cruise Vessel. Minor repair work involved steel work and piping. Shortly after a second tugboat, Reboport's Monforte, arrived for reclassification. This 20-day project involved mechanical, piping renewal and blasting.      Mr Rodrigues said one of Navalrocha's greatest assets is its strategic location in the sheltered Tagus Bay with more than 300 days of sunshine every year. "Our yard is able to offer a fast and cost-effective solution to ship companies looking to avoid the congested Strait of Gibraltar or Mediterranean," he said. "The scale of the operation, with three dedicated drydocks, also places us at an advantage ensuring every project receives priority treatment from a 70-strong workforce and cluster of sub-contractors based on site."

  That's the word from Morton Superintendent Jeff Hill, who also said he isn't sure when or if the district will replace Patrick Mainieri because of the uncertainty surrounding the resumption of extracurricular activities in the district when the new school year begins.


   


  Mainieri, the district's first director of student activities and engagement, left that job this month after holding it for just two years to become an assistant principal at Bloomington High School. His first day at Bloomington is Aug. 3.


   


  Mainieri's main task in Morton was to ensure that students in grades 5-12 could find an extracurricular activity that connected them to their school and increased their college and career readiness.


   


  "I'm thankful that Dr. Hill and Dr. Smock (Morton assistant superintendent Craig Smock) trusted me, giving me the opportunity to grow the district's extracurricular offerings by exploring new ones," Mainieri said.


   


  "I'm also thankful that everyone I worked with in the district understands why I'm leaving," he said.


   


  Mainieri, 36, said family is the sole reason for his departure from Morton.


   


  He said the uncertain short-term future of extracurricular activities in Morton because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions did not play a role in his decision.


   


  He and his wife, Tracy, an associate professor at Illinois State University, live in Normal with their 18-month-old daughter, Evelynn.


   


  Now Evelynn's father and mother both will be working in the Twin Cities.


   


  One of Mainieri's Morton legacies is the formation of an eSports club at Morton High School.


   


  He did extensive research in an effort to convince the School Board to launch the club, but the board voted 5-1 in August 2019 to postpone a decision on forming an eSports club on a one-year trial basis because of concerns about use of the League of Legends video game and increased screen time by club members.


   


  A group of Morton High School students responded to the board's worries, and the club was approved by the board a month later.


   


  "I couldn't be prouder of those students, how they handled the situation," Mainieri said.


   


  Brandon Parrott, a seventh-grade science teacher at Morton Junior High School, is the eSports club's sponsor and coach.


   


  He said the 18 students in the club last school year -- the most possible because of the technology available -- didn't get to compete against other schools, but did practice and scrimmage.


   


  The club was supposed to become a team this fall with the expected sanctioning of eSports by the Illinois High School Association, but the IHSA has delayed its eSports decision while it navigates how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  "I appreciate the work Patrick did laying the groundwork for our club," Parrott said.


   


  Mainieri was wearing several hats when he left the Morton School District. All of his duties have been absorbed by other district employees.


   


  Mainieri kept his job as the district's K-12 fine arts coordinator when he was named director of student activities and engagement -- he was the district's first fine arts coordinator -- and he also was charge of managing the Bertha Frank Performing Arts Center at Morton High School and the district's MPTV network.


   


  He was employed by the district for five years, initially serving as Morton High School's assistant director of bands and a music teacher.


   


  Before coming to Morton, Mainieri was a high school and middle school band director (2006-13) in South Carolina, and he was the marching and visual coordinator for Clemson University's Tiger Band (2010-14).

British pop's biggest event, the Brit Awards, will take place three months later than usual next year because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, organisers said on Monday.
 The annual ceremony normally takes place in February but will now be held on May 11, said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of music industry body BPI and the Brit Awards Ltd.
 "We want to make sure that the Brits delivers the outstanding production levels, superstar performances and live excitement that make it the biggest night in music," he said.
 "We believe that the best way to achieve this in 2021 is to move the show back a few months to May."
 The decision was made after consultation with the music industry and sponsors, taking into consideration "safety and logistical considerations" imposed by the pandemic.
 This year's ceremony was held in February, just weeks before the outbreak took hold, and saw breakthrough London rapper Dave steal the show with a politically charged performance.
 The 21-year-old won best album for "Psychodrama", which addresses black identity and institutional racism.
 He earned a standing ovation for his performance of the album's stand-out track, "Black", adding a new verse accusing Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being racist.
 But the ceremony was overshadowed by criticism of a lack of female nominees in mixed-gender categories, with just four women named in 25 spots -- who all lost out to men.
 The Brits were first staged in October 1977 when Cliff Richard won the best British male category. Shirley Bassey took the female equivalent.

"The Big Dog" Roman Reigns hasn't been seen live on WWE television since earlier this year due to concerns he had over wrestling during the coronavirus pandemic, as his battles with leukemia have left him immunocompromised.


  During a new interview with The Hindu's _Metroplus_, Reigns shed some light on the decision he made to go on hiatus during these difficult times.


  "For me, I just had to make a choice for my family. [WWE] has done everything that they can to make it the safest work environment possible," Roman said. "It is not the workplace that I was necessarily concerned about. The decision was taken mainly because each performer travels so much, and we are all such a diverse group and from all over the place. I'm not convinced, and I can't trust the fact that everybody is taking it as seriously and locking themselves down at home like I am.

Hertz, a company that Axios described as a "Frankenstein of financial engineering," filed for bankruptcy in May.

That leveraged buyout included just $2.3 billion of equity -- with the rest of the purchase borrowed money.
