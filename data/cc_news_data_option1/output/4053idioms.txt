Thorpe says people ask what they can do to help. A good place to begin is to get educated about the issues. Thorpe encourages people to learn how to talk to children about abuse. She says children cannot differentiate between child sexual abuse or trafficking. For children, the experience is the same. Kids need to understand what is happening and how to get help. Thorpe says children must be taught to listen to their "uh-oh feeling" and report abuse to a trusted adult.

e čekají křehkou herečku velké životní trable, nejspíš viděla v kávové sedlině, z níž tak často a tak ráda předpovídala kolegům budoucnost, Helena Růžičková. Tehdy ale Růžičková Vančurové odmítla sdělit, co vidí na dně Martina hrnečku. Odbyla ji se slovy, že jí nic vykládat nebude, protože všemu moc věří. Osud se zřejmě nedal odvrátit, ale i když herečku Martu Vančurovou (72) čekaly těžké chvilky, se vším si vždycky poradila. Jak říká, naučila se neřešit věk, dívat se dopředu, čerpat z minulosti, ale ne se v ní utápět.

Il Lazio, proprio ieri sera, ha pubblicato il testo della manifestazione di interesse per medici di famiglia e pediatri. Si punta a raccogliere l'adesione di coloro che sono disponibili a eseguire i tamponi rapidi nel loro studio. In questo modo, si crea una prima linea di tamponi rapidi, che screma quei casi che normalmente, in epoca pre Covid, sarebbero stati considerati una banale febbre o un banale raffreddore. Ne capiteranno tantissimi durante l'anno scolastico, se ogni volta si deve andare ai drive in, sara un calvario per le famiglie. L'obiettivo e evitare che si paralizzino le scuole e al contempo che vada in tilt il sistema dei tamponi che rischia di essere monopolizzato dai falsi allarmi delle scuole. All'interno del Cts c'e chi ritiene che su questa strategia, inevitabile, serva una presa di responsabilita della politica, del governo, con la consapevolezza che un margine di errore esiste nei tamponi rapidi, compensato ampiamente dalla possibilita di eseguirne molti di piu, in modo piu tempestivo e semplice. Va emanata una legge che tuteli il pediatra quando firma un certificato che consente a un bambino di tornare a scuola sulla base di un tampone rapido. Fino a quando il governo dice che l'unico tampone diagnostico accettato e il molecolare, il pediatra si atterra a quella linea. All'interno del Cts c'e chi e pronto a dire che il tampone rapido rappresenta un rischio accettabile, ma deve esserci una presa di responsabilita politica nel governo.
