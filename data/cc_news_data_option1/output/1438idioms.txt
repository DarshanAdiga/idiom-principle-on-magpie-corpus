Jon is the main character, yet he is so passive that he does barely anything. Tyrion, once the smartest man in Westeros, is reduced to making silly eunuch jokes. Cersei, one of the best TV villains ever, was the most reactive villain ever, which is hard to believe considering she has always taken the fight to her enemies. Instead, she went out with a whimper rather than the sort of bang that saw her blow up the Sept of Baelor in the season six finale. Props to Lena Headey for still delivering an incredible performance despite having so little to do.
 I've rewatched each season of the show a dozen times (season four is my favourite) and often watch my favourite clips on YouTube, and they have such rewatchability because the story is thrilling. Not just the battles, murder, and twists, but the conversations, too. Littlefinger and Varys, Cersei and Tyrion, Tywin and Olenna. The thing that makes "Game of Thrones" so gripping are the characters and their battle of wits, like this one:
 But season eight, because of all of the above, was devoid of that. There was not one crackling conversation, and there were zero plot twists or shocking reveals -- something "Game of Thrones" is renowned for. I was desperate (both last year and this year) for something intriguing to happen -- so much so that I audibly whooped when Rhaegal died out of the blue. My boyfriend was cross that I cheered for Rhaegel's death, but I was just glad that something had gripped me, even if it did end up making no sense.
 Last year, I was angry that D&D had wasted years of build-up and ruined some of my favourite characters (I will never forgive them for how they ruined Jaime Lannister). This year, I was just sad that they had turned "Game of Thrones" into an intelligent, enthralling, unpredictable political thriller into a bland, boring show.

Former Napoli and Udinese director Pierpaolo Marino believes AC Milan already regret signing Leonardo Bonucci, claiming the big-spending Serie A giants wish they had brought in a "top striker" instead.
 Milan pulled off a coup in the off-season, prising Italy international defender Bonucci away from champions Juventus in a €42million deal.
 The 30-year-old has not fully settled into his surroundings as Vincenzo Montella's new-look Milan struggle for consistency, having already lost two of their opening six Serie A games this season.
 And Marino feels Milan – who signed forwards Andre Silva and Nikola Kalinic for 2017-18 – would have benefited more from investing the Bonucci money in attack.
 "I think Milan already regret buying Bonucci," Marino told Rai Sport.
 "Montella didn't want to switch to a three-man defence, but he found himself forced to change his plans by the arrival of Bonucci, but even that is not enough.
 "I think that if Massimiliano Mirabelli and Marco Fassone could go back in time, they'd spend that money to buy Bonucci on a top striker instead."
 Milan face a big test Sunday, welcoming high-flying Roma to San Siro as pressure mounts on Montella following their loss to Sampdoria last time out.

estella-lizarra - Con el objetivo de hacerle la vida un poco mas facil estos dias a las personas que tienen alguna dificultad ha nacido en Estella-Lizarra Zaintza Sarea, una red ciudadana de cuidados, un grupo vinculado Lizarra Ciudad de Acogida y que auna a vecinos y vecinas que, de forma altruista, se han puesto a trabajar para dar respuesta a esas carencias.
 Tras hacer un llamamiento, explicaban, en apenas 48 ya habia mas de 40 voluntarios dispuestos a echar una mano. Ahora, insistian desde la entidad, tienen que ver donde se les necesita y donde pueden hacer un papel relevante; si es bajandole a alguien la basura, ayudando con la compra, con algun tipo de papeleo, etc.
 El grupo de voluntarios, que cuenta con el apoyo del Ayuntamiento, sigue abierto, puesto que no tiene sentido cerrarle las puertas a nadie, pero el objetivo que se marcan ahora es el de detectar las necesidades y carencias que apremian a la ciudadania; saber donde son utiles, donde pueden ayudar. Por ello, explicaban, van a lanzar una pequeña campaña por los portales y en las tiendas que estan abiertas para que todos aquellos que requieran de algun tipo de ayuda puedan ponerse en contacto con el numero 686586837 y solicitarla.
 mas acciones Cruz Roja Estella solicito un grupo de voluntarios para poder repartir el _Kit- beca comedor_ con el objetivo de que los niños y niñas que se beneficiaban de este sustento puedan seguir haciendolo a pesar de la situacion. En cuanto se enteraron, del grupo Zaintza Sarea se apuntaron en torno a 20 personas.
 El Ayuntamiento, ademas, les cedio el zaguan de entrada al edificio consistorial para el almacenaje y posterior reparto de estos kits.
 Por otro lado, el Consistorio de Estella, en colaboracion con Cruz Roja, va a repartir por los comercios de la ciudad que permanecen abiertos pantallas faciales protectoras donadas por Ayuda Makers Navarra. El Ayuntamiento se ha puesto en contactado con la Asociacion de Comerciantes, Hosteleria y Servicios para evaluar cuantos asociados estan interesados en recibir este material mientras que el resto de establecimientos pueden solicitarlas a traves del correo electronico _desarrollo.local @estella-lizarra.com_ o en el telefono 948 548243. Una vez que conozcan la demanda, informaran de como se hara la entrega.
 Desde la Administracion local reiteraban la importancia que tiene "la cooperacion y el trabajo en red entre diferentes agentes para hacer frente a esta crisis".

He says where it might go too far is if people started being arrested for violating social distancing guidelines, even as some inmates are released from jails to keep them safe from the virus.
 Democratic analyst John Richardson argues "This is about public safety. I think the governor is taking the right tone in this matter."
 Our analysts both think Gov. Mills and Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah have been doing a good job keeping the public informed through regular briefings.
 By contrast, they think President Trump has politicized the daily national Coronavirus briefings.
 Richardson says what Trump is doing is a political event "and it's obvious to people of America but it's all politics."
 Harriman feels that at the start of the crisis, Trump's briefings represented real leadership and helped calm the country.
 But Harriman feels "I feel he has gone too far, this has now turned into a daily press conference couched in the name of an update on the virus. It's time for him to step back out of the picture and let us focus on the solution to this virus."
 This past week, Lisa Savage, the former Green Independent Party candidate who decided to run unenrolled instead, submitted signatures to get on the November ballot in Maine's U.S Senate race.
 John Richardson says Savage is unlikely to gain much traction for herself, but says her presence could help elect a Democrat.
 "The more people she brings out of the polls who are on the far left of the spectrum," Richardson says, "means more people for the Democratic candidate. I think with ranked choice voting, it means a better chance that the Democratic nominee can win against Susan Collins in the fall."

There’s a work table in the office where Greenwood has room to do other projects, like sewing, photography, or even just organizing papers.
 “The table isn’t usually that clean,” she laughs. “But I do like to keep things organized so that I can just focus on what’s on my plate. It puts me in a state of mind where I feel like I can create. It’s really hard for me to get into that zone if I’m feeling like I’m not comfortable.”
 A reason the room can be tidy is because there’s a closet where Greenwood stores things like photo equipment, papers and other odds and ends.
 “My agent gave me a beautiful vintage scarf with ballerinas on it,” she said. “I hung that up over the pink curtain, which is actually hiding a really messy closet.”
 Other things lovingly organized in the room include meaningful pieces of art: framed corks from Champagne bottles that were opened after finishing a book, portraits of her daughters, a paint-by-numbers ballerina that her grandfather Greenwood made for her when she was a child and a sketch of the family’s Vermont home.

“Right now, we’re sold primarily through retail outlets, and with retail being shut down we pivoted very, very quickly to produce these masks based on local need and connections that we have,” he said.
 Rauvola said “it isn’t necessarily easy” to start making the hoods on the fly but he got help from his HP support team.
 Peace Health brought him a sample of what they needed on a Saturday, a 3D design was ready by Monday, and the first prototypes rolled off the assembly line a day later. Within a week, following some modifications, a final version was being made.
 The hood design had already been long ago approved by regulators so — unlike the new Maker Mask — the company was told there was no need to recertify the parts his company is printing for the respirator devices.

The captain of the San Diego-based guided-missile destroyer Decatur was removed from command in January for filing false position reports to the Navy, according to a Navy investigation recently obtained by the Union-Tribune.
 According to the investigation, Cmdr. John “Bob” Bowen, the Decatur’s commanding officer, ordered his crew in September not to report that the ship had gone dead in the water.
 The ship had stopped to conduct maintenance on one of its propeller shafts while transiting the eastern Pacific from Hawaii to Seal Beach, California..
 In order to hide the four-hour-long stop from the fleet, the crew reported inaccurate ship positions to make it appear as though the vessel never stopped, the investigation said.

We are now entering the fourth week of restrictions to stop the spread of coronavirus. I thought it might be useful to give some more detail about how Ipswich Borough Council is operating in these unprecedented circumstances. Our top priority is to maintain the delivery of key services to Ipswich residents and businesses. In line with Government instructions, we have closed many council facilities such as closed sports centres, swimming pools, the Corn Exchange and Regent. The only other major service affected is the collection of brown bins. I know this is an inconvenience, but it is essential for public health reasons - despite staff being off work due to illness and self-isolation - that we retain enough capacity to continue to empty black bins. As things currently stand, we still have enough people at work in our fantastic bin crews to continue emptying both black and blue bins and don't see this having to change over the coming week. Wherever possible we are seeking to redeploy staff from council facilities that have closed down. Well over 100 people are now currently working in a different area to their normal job. One reason for redeployment is to boost existing services that are facing more demand such our 24-hour a day Emergency Services Centre, the HEARS community alarm service, sheltered housing schemes and parks patrols who are ensuring that social distancing measures are observed. Two particular areas we have bolstered are in staff able to take phone queries from residents and in processing benefits claims. As firms lay off staff, we are seeing new claims running at more than double the normal rate and it is essential we get help to these people as soon as possible. We are also using redeployed staff to meet new demands such as implementing the Government's business grants scheme. We have already paid out more than £10m to hard-pressed local businesses. Around 40 people are also now helping to distribute food to vulnerable households. I am incredibly proud of the way Ipswich Borough Council staff have, largely unseen, stepped up to the challenge of supporting Ipswich through this crisis. They are fully deserving of inclusion in our round of applause on Thursday evenings.

Almost a year ago, the world was finally given season eight of "Game of Thrones" after a wait that seemed like an eternity. Unfortunately, our excitement for the final season of GoT was ... misplaced. Critics reviews were mixed, at best, while the fans receptions, myself included, was scolding.
 Things got so dramatic that a Change.org petition was created for HBO to remake the eighth and final season with "competent writers," which has now been signed by over 1.8 million people at the time of writing -- and is still getting signatures at a fairly quick rate.
 However, since the coronavirus crisis has left most of us self-isolating while in lockdown, I decided to use my free time to rewatch season eight to see if, one year on, my opinion on the controversial final season of my favorite television show ever has changed.
 Unfortunately, after a second viewing a year later, I still believe that season eight was anti-"Game of Thrones," despite an excellent cast and incredible artistic work including costumes, sets, effects, and music.
 However, although it was, sadly, equally painful a second time around, season eight has reignited my passion for the world George R. R. Martin created, and thanks to the final season I am now diving back into Westeros anew as a devoted fan.

The visit of Manchester United to Anfield on Saturday could make or break Liverpool's season, according to Jamie Redknapp, who feels Jurgen Klopp may soon find himself under mounting pressure.
 The Reds go into the crunch fixture against their fierce rivals seventh in the Premier League table, already seven points behind the joint leaders and with memories of a humiliating 5-0 loss to Manchester City last month fresh in the memory.
 They have only won once in the last four league games and former Reds midfielder Redknapp pointed out that Klopp has done little better this term than his predecessor Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked in October 2015 with the team 10th in the table.
 "It's the sort of game that, for Liverpool, it can turn your season around," the ex-England international told Omnisport when asked about the keenly contested rivalry between Liverpool and the Red Devils.
 "I've played in plenty of games against Man United when, if you win, it's a complete season-changer.
 "If they lose... maybe the pressure starts to come on Jurgen Klopp a bit. I mean that in a nice way because... points to points, he's not much better than Brendan Rodgers, if not worse.
 "It's an interesting game for him and it's a game you do not want to lose against Manchester United, at any time of the season."

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety System envisions a near future of fully autonomous vehicles on the roads, bolstered by guidelines for the safe testing, development and implementation of advanced technologies. Companies that have specialized in passenger vehicles, such as Volvo and Tesla, are turning their attention to the trucking industry as they develop their own autonomous freight vehicles.
 But an often-overlooked impact of autonomous vehicles is on people who drive for a living. Predictions vary on whether autonomous vehicles will negatively or positively affect truckers. A 2018 study commissioned by the American Center for Mobility and led by Michigan State University predicts that automated vehicles are unlikely to displace truckers in the foreseeable future.
 Meanwhile, University of Pennsylvania sociologist and trucking expert Steve Viscelli projected in a 2018 research paper that nearly 300,000 trucking jobs will be lost to automation within the next 25 years.
 Stephenson, of Paccar, is unsure when fully autonomous vehicles will hit the market, but he anticipates that the technology will be used soon on smaller scales, such as at transportation ports where there are few pedestrians and little traffic.

The author of “How to Raise an Adult,” __ Lythcott-Haims said there’s a fine balance that parents need to strike between communicating the seriousness of following rules and young people’s desire for the independence they had when they were living on their own.
 “Everybody is accustomed to greater autonomy and freedom, and now we’re in an environment where everyone is supposed to be locked down,” she said. “We kind of want to be sure everybody is abiding by the rules, and yet we’re all adults here. So I think there’s a lot of walking on eggshells about serious issues.”
 Lythcott-Haims says this all fundamentally comes down to trust — whether the person has returned home or not.
 For young adults who are far away from family, it’s also a fraught time. When twentysomethings are separated in moments like this, she says, they become more like peers with their parents. Trust comes when parents and adult children are able to have honest conversations about the risks they are facing and the precautions they are taking.
 “I think they’re both worried about each other and they’re both having compassion for each other and wanting to check up and check in,” Lythcott- Haims says. “But inherently, each is required to look after oneself, which I think develops agency and resilience in those young adults who did not return home.”
 In the middle of last month, Milwaukee native Ben Levey had a frank should-I- stay-or-should-I-go discussion with his mother. Both of his parents have had health issues.
 “I was potentially worried about being asymptomatic and getting her sick,” Levey said of his mother. “That’s scary because you really don’t know.”
 His regular Friday night Shabbat dinners with friends in Washington, D.C., had started to change. Instead of ripping the challah bread with their hands, as is custom, Levey and his friends cut it with a knife and kept some distance from one another. The 24-year-old stopped taking the train to his job at a nonprofit.
 As it became clear that he could work from home, Levey decided that his best bet was to pack up his car and make the 13- hour drive back home to Wisconsin. Now, he’s living in a room where he hasn’t spent much time since he was 17. He has claimed the living room as his workspace.
 His younger brother also is home from college and taking his classes via Zoom.
 “We’re four adults in a house in the suburbs,” which feels just a little more cramped than it has in the past, Levey said. “My dad has the back office. I got the living room and my mom is in the bedroom.”
 Lucy Putnam, 23, didn’t have to travel far to get home. Still, it was a decision that gave her pause as she wrestled with the implications of getting her parents or siblings sick.
 Putnam’s roommates at her apartment near Beverly Grove had been on the go, not paying much attention to social distancing before it was mandated. “I had been interacting with my roommates,” she said, so she asked her parents, “Would you prefer [for] me to stay in my apartment? I’m young and it won’t affect me.’”
 No, her mother said, please come home.
 Putnam, who works in film and TV development and can work from home, is grateful to have the means and the ability to ride this out in her childhood bedroom in West L.A.
 There was, however, the challenge of having a boyfriend, who had been coming and going from the house, which worried her parents. He eventually returned to his family’s home on the East Coast.
 Three weeks into the stay-at-home order in Los Angeles, Vidaurre’s circle of roommates continues to shrink and his anxiety growing.
 It turned out the housemate who returned to Fresno had not been infected with the coronavirus. He had influenza.
 There are still about 15 people living in the house in northeast L.A.
 With that many people in close quarters, Vidaurre feels like he constantly needs to clean dishes in the communal kitchen. When someone else begins cleaning, he wonders if the cutlery he just left to dry has been contaminated.
 “It just increases the paranoia so much,” he said. “If it were possible to transition to living alone and creating an environment that can be clean and safe, I would do that.”
 Vidaurre plans to be out of the house by the end of the month.
 He and one of his roommates, Oko Carter, 30, share a box of disposable masks.
 As with Vidaurre, Carter returning to his family isn’t an option. Both his grandparents are over 70 and not in great health. And his dad is a truck driver transporting medical equipment in Florida.
 Carter’s dog-walking and dog-sitting business has dried up, but he has lived in Los Angeles for a decade, and he says that if he’s going to ride this out somewhere, it’s going to be here.
 For now, he shares a room with two other people — one of whom works at a local 7-Eleven. Some of his housemates have lost their jobs or are struggling in the gig economy.
 “The bedroom normally holds five people, but only three are here right now,” Carter says, sounding almost relieved. “It’s just been this feeling for those who have remained — it’s been a little sad seeing people who had work just have nothing.”
 Still, Carter remains optimistic. He notes what’s been written on the dry- erase board in the communal kitchen.

In light of the present circumstances, may international sanctions be relaxed, since these make it difficult for countries on which they have been imposed to provide adequate support to their citizens, and may all nations be put in a position to meet the greatest needs of the moment through the reduction, if not the forgiveness, of the debt burdening the balance sheets of the poorest nations.

A figure for the whole U.K. will be released later.The 657 deaths come on top of the 9,875 deaths of people with COVID-19 in British hospitals announced Saturday.While the number of new cases and hospitalizations appears to have plateaued, deaths are still rising. With virus death tolls in Italy and Spain on a downward slope, there are growing fears that the U.K. will end up being the country with the most virus deaths in Europe.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was discharged from a London hospital where he was treated in intensive care for the coronavirus ahead of government figures Sunday in which the U.K. is expected to surpass 10,000 virus-related deaths.Johnson's office said he left St. Thomas' Hospital and will continue his recovery at Chequers, the prime minister's country house. "On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work," the statement said. "He wishes to thank everybody at St. Thomas' for the brilliant care he has received." Johnson had been in the hospital for a week and had spent three nights in the intensive care unit. Earlier he said he owes his life to the National Health Service staff who treated him."I can't thank them enough," Johnson said in his first public statement since he was moved out of intensive care Thursday night. "I owe them my life."Johnson's partner, Carrie Symonds, said in tweets that she "cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough" and that she "will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you." She admitted there "were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones."Johnson, 55, was the first world leader confirmed to have the illness. His coronavirus symptoms at first were said to have been mild, including a cough and a fever, and he was working from home during the first few days. But he was admitted to St. Thomas' on April 5 after his condition worsened and he was transferred the following day to its intensive care unit, where he received oxygen but was not put onto a ventilator. He spent three nights there before moving back to a regular hospital ward.While he convalesces, Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to handle the nation's response to the pandemic that has infected at least 1.78 million worldwide and killed 109,000 people. Experts say those numbers seriously understate the impact of the pandemic, due to limited testing and different ways of counting the dead.Britain has been in effective lockdown since March 23 and the government is set to extend the restrictions sometime this week. But Johnson's Conservative government has come under fire for its slow response to confronting the pandemic — allowing tens of thousands to gather at the Cheltenham horse racing festival in mid- March, for example. It's also faced criticism for its slow rollout of a coronavirus testing program. Over the past few days, the government has also faced acute criticism for the lack of personal protective equipment for frontline workers in hospitals, amid reports that some nurses have had to resort to cutting up garbage bags to cover themselves. Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed Saturday that 19 frontline workers have died from the virus.The Royal College of Nursing has piled more pressure on the government, urging members to refuse to treat patients as a "last resort" if adequate protections are not provided.Business Secretary Alok Sharma stopped short Sunday of apologizing for the lack of medical masks and gowns but said it is "absolutely right that no medical professional should be placed in a position where they have to make that choice.""That is why we are making sure we get the equipment to the frontline," he told Sky News. Figures later Sunday are expected to show that over 10,000 people in the U.K. have died after testing positive for coronavirus. That would make Britain the fourth European country after Italy, Spain and France to reach that grim milestone, even with its limited testing.On Saturday, Britain reported 917 new coronavirus-related deaths in its hospitals for an overall death toll of 9,875. The U.K. total only includes deaths in hospitals.While the number of new cases and hospitalizations appears to have plateaued, deaths are still rising. With virus death tolls in Italy and Spain on a downward slope, there are growing fears that the U.K. will end up being the country with the most virus deaths in Europe. The continent has had almost 74,000 reported coronavirus deaths.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust an a scientific adviser to the British government, said the U.K. was likely to be "one of the worst, if not the worst-affected country in Europe."He told the BBC that Britain has "lessons to learn" from Germany, where much more widespread testing has been accompanied by much fewer coronavirus deaths. Last week, the British government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, warned that the daily number of deaths would likely increase for a couple more weeks.Sharma refused to be drawn in on whether the U.K. will end up with the highest death toll in Europe. "We are at different trajectories," he said told the BBC. "We are starting to see these measures work."Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

 Wherever possible we are seeking to redeploy staff from council facilities that have closed down. Well over 100 people are now currently working in a different area to their normal job.
 One reason for redeployment is to boost existing services that are facing more demand such our 24-hour a day Emergency Services Centre, the HEARS community alarm service, sheltered housing schemes and parks patrols who are ensuring that social distancing measures are observed.
 Two particular areas we have bolstered are in staff able to take phone queries from residents and in processing benefits claims. As firms lay off staff, we are seeing new claims running at more than double the normal rate and it is essential we get help to these people as soon as possible.
 We are also using redeployed staff to meet new demands such as implementing the Government’s business grants scheme. We have already paid out more than £10m to hard-pressed local businesses.
 Around 40 people are also now helping to distribute food to vulnerable households.
 I am incredibly proud of the way Ipswich Borough Council staff have, largely unseen, stepped up to the challenge of supporting Ipswich through this crisis. They are fully deserving of inclusion in our round of applause on Thursday evenings.

Over the four decades since those mid 70s battles, on and off the pitch, the game itself has altered too.

Gregory Mickie Carr, 46, of Orange, slipped away in the Leominster Hospital on April 6, 2020 due to the dreaded Corvid-19 virus. He was the fiance' of Andrea Williams. Born in Brooklyn, New York on March 6, 1974, he was a son of the late Kenneth and Martha Carr. He later lived in Greenfield, MA, where he met the love of his life, Andrea Williams. He graduated from Wyandanch High School and later took classes at Greenfield (MA) Community College. Mickie was a very caring man with a huge heart, everyone who met him, loved him which is why he had an abundance of friends. Mickie's life centered around caring for his family and making sure they were happy. An avid sports fan, he absolutely loved all his New England teams, especially the Patriots, Red Sox and Celtics. Mickie enjoyed talking about the games while they were on with his friends, especially his good friend Luis. His hobbies consisted of spending time with his kids and Andrea and going on fun, exciting, laughter filled vacations such as yearly camping trips to Maine, Germany, Aruba and Puerto Rico. Mickie absolutely enjoyed dancing so much. For many years he and his good friends Chino, Leo, Joey and Flaco would go to many night clubs and groove to hip-hop and reggae music. With his imposing size and desire to help protect people he was naturally an amazing bouncer over at his favorite nightclub, Lit, in Amherst, MA, where he acquired an extended family. As his larger than life personality grew, so did his family. Reza and Nani became so close to him that they were now Brotha's. As Mickie's love and joyous aura spread into others, their happiness followed. Frequently going to the Cinemark movie theater on Sundays, you would feel his infectious laughter, shared with Chino, Leo, Nani, Marc, Mike, and Brandon. His appetite for peanut M&M;'s would make even the most sternest person chuckle. He will be greatly missed but truly never forgotten.

Ryan Giggs has declared his interest in the Premier League managerial vacancies at Everton and Leicester City.
 Manchester United great Giggs served as assistant to Louis van Gaal during the Dutchman's Old Trafford tenure, leaving when Jose Mourinho took the reins in 2016.
 The former Wales international also interviewed for the job at Swansea City last season but has only taken charge of four senior matches when placed in caretaker charge of United after David Moyes’ departure in 2014.
 Everton sacked Ronald Koeman on Monday after a 5-2 weekend defeat to Arsenal at Goodison Park left them in the bottom three – a point worse off than Leicester after caretaker boss Michael Appleton oversaw a 2-1 win at Swansea in the wake of Craig Shakespeare's dismissal.
 "For me, these are clubs I would be interested in," Giggs told Sky Sports.
 "I think you look at those two teams, Leicester being champions two seasons ago, Everton being a fantastic club with a fantastic history.
 "However, there are a lot of coaches out there who would be interested in those positions."
 Giggs is keen to be the latest student of Alex Ferguson to go into management but, despite his lofty current targets, he would not necessarily insist upon a Premier League job.
 "I've said all along that I'd be open to clubs which share the ambitions of myself," he added.
 "I want to improve clubs and improve players, to enjoy working for them and for players to enjoy the challenge.
 "There are clubs in the Premier League which would be good jobs but also in the Championship and League One.
 "It's more about the philosophy for me than the stature of the club."

“No, we’re fine,” was Bowen’s response, the sailor said.
 The sailor said that a list of coordinates of where the ship would have been had they never stopped was created. The crew used these coordinates — written on a piece of paper — to report the ship’s false position to the fleet until they were back on course as if they’d never stopped, the report said.
 “There was this piece of paper where the times and speed were calculated,” said one sailor who told investigators he refused to participate in the ruse. “It was, in my opinion, designed to make it look like we were continuing along our track ... when we weren’t.”
 By 2:30 p.m, the ship was underway again. It would keep reporting false coordinates to 3rd Fleet until it caught up to where they’d told the fleet they were later that evening, the investigation said.
 In his interview with investigators, Bowen said the maintenance was routine and not due to a failure.
 He told investigators that as long as the ship didn’t fall more than four hours off schedule, he thought there was no need to notify the fleet.
 When asked about why he didn’t want to notify the fleet the ship was dead in the water, Bowen said he didn’t want them “asking questions.”
 “I didn’t see the reason to let 3rd Fleet know that we — I mean, as long as we’re not doing anything crazy,” Bowen said, according to a transcript of the interview. “We could still do our mission. I just didn’t want them asking questions about ... ‘Hey, why are you guys doing this?’”

 ‘MYSTERIOUS PNEUMONIA’
 On New Year’s Eve, China informed the World Health Organization of a “mysterious pneumonia outbreak” spreading through Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million.
 The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories. Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished. He later died of the virus.
 The Pentagon first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open source reports emanating from China. By early January, warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government. On Jan. 3, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe.
 Quickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials began doubting China's reported rates of infection and death toll. They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response. U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.

Former Manchester United and England midfielder Paul Scholes has been interviewed for the vacant manager's job at League One Oldham Athletic.
 Oldham, who parted company with boss John Sheridan on September 25, declined to make an official comment on the matter, but Omnisport understands Scholes held talks on Wednesday.
 Ex-Netherlands star Clarence Seedorf was interviewed last month, but is now out of the running.
 The Lactics have won three consecutive games in all competitions under caretaker manager Richie Wellens, who like Scholes is a product of the Old Trafford youth system.
 Scholes, an 11-time Premier League champion, was previously offered the chance to become manager at his boyhood club when Lee Johnson left for Barnsley in 2015.
 In a column for the Independent newspaper at the time, Scholes wrote: "One day I believe that I will manage Oldham, the club that my dad supports and who are very close to my heart.
 "They are a really good family club who mean a great deal to a lot of people - myself included. I just did not feel this was the right time."
 At the start of this year, Scholes took youth training sessions at Oldham as part of work towards his UEFA A coaching licence.
 Since calling time on a United career comprising 717 appearances and 155 goals, Scholes has worked as a television pundit and briefly coached at Old Trafford in the aftermath of David Moyes' ill-fated reign.
 Along old United colleagues Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, Scholes owns a stake in non-league side Salford City.

 More than 1,780,750 declared cases have been registered in 193 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December. Of these cases, at least 359,200 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.
 Many countries are only testing the most serious cases.
 The United States, which recorded its first death in late February, has registered the most deaths in the world with 20,608 and the most infections with 530,006.

They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response. U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.

Onetime Microsoft executive Jonathan Roberts knows that not all 3D-printed personal protective equipment being produced for the nation’s coronavirus response is created equal.
 The past few weeks have thrust 3D printing technology into the spotlight as entrepreneurs and well-doers scramble to convert factories, shops and even home basements into makeshift assembly lines to produce personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers. Once best known for a Texas company’s nationwide distributing of blueprints for homemade handguns, 3D printing is now viewed as a potential lifesaver in the race to get masks, visors, shields and other PPE to those needing them most.
 But amid concerns about the effectiveness of PPE made from 3D printers, Roberts used his connections at Seattle-based nonprofits and tech firms to fast-track a solution both with federal approval and broad distribution. This past week, his Maker Mask — a free, 3D printable respirator mask that covers the mouth, as opposed to hooded versions — became the first of its kind to receive National Institutes of Health certification for COVID-19 response.
 “It sends a signal to those people downloading it that this has gone through a vetting process,” Roberts said, adding the mask was approved for first responders such as firefighters, police, rescue workers and other emergency personnel, but not for use in medical facilities. “That it’s a rigorous examination they’ve put it through and they’ve provided us feedback…. It’s a vetting that should provide some comfort to those that are printing it and handing it to first responders.”
 Instructions for making the reusable masks had been downloaded more than 35,000 times in 117 countries as of Friday.
 Demand for face shields, along with N95-masks and other PPE, has skyrocketed with the surge of patients infected with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. The equipment being made on 3D printers nationwide, including by aerospace firms like Boeing and footwear and apparel companies, has mostly been meant as a temporary stopgap to quickly help overwhelmed hospital workers achieve minimal protection amid PPE shortages.

The temperature checks are now being rolled out companywide at its facilities in the United States and Europe, and at Whole Foods stores. The plan is to test hundreds of thousands of Amazon workers every day, and those with a fever of 100.4 or higher will be sent home until they've gone three consecutive days without one.
 But now, the company wants to take measures a step farther, and develop its own COVID-19 testing lab where employees could be tested for the virus regularly.
 The company discussed the plan in a blog post earlier this week.
 "If every person, including people with no symptoms, could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we are all fighting this virus," read the blog post.
 A team of Amazon employees from several different departments, including research scientists and software engineers, have moved off their normal duties and are now solely focused on developing the testing lab.
 Tony Lystra, with the Puget Sound Business Journal, said Amazon is a trillion- dollar company with a proven track record.
 "Amazon has been able to do what even governments have failed to do, and that's, in this case, they're going to try to test at scale in a way that could make a measurable difference for their company during the pandemic," said Lystra.
 Amazon explained in its blog post the benefits would be huge, saying those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy "with confidence."
 It's unclear when the testing lab will be up and running, but Amazon said, "We think it's worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn with others."

RAS AL KHAIMAH, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 12th Apr, 2020) The shareholders of Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries, Julphar, approved the company’s plan to restructure its capital at its annual general assembly, AGM.
 Julphar’s Board of Directors had recommended the restructuring of capital in January, and called for the AGM to pass a special resolution for a capital reduction followed by a capital increase by way of rights issue.
 The plan aims to "strengthen the company’s capital position and improve its debt profile", the Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries said in a statement, adding that the rights issue will increase the share capital of the company by up to AED500 million by issuing new shares with a nominal value of AED1, after canceling the company’s losses.
 Julphar’s capital restructuring is subject to the final approval of the Securities and Commodities Authority.
 Following comprehensive changes to the board and the executive management team in 2019, Julphar said it is executing a comprehensive transformation programme, encompassing market re-entry plans for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, an expansion of its product portfolio, investments in quality control systems, and the implementation of a cost optimisation initiative with a view to returning to profitability and rebuilding its leading market position.

 A similar trend is playing out in Britain, where people who suddenly aren’t making expensive commutes into London are being asked to donate the difference to the National Health Service; a campaign that provides menstrual pads to women who are homeless, refugees or struggling financially; and a nonprofit that helps victims of domestic violence.

On Sept. 13, the Decatur was cruising at full power about halfway between Hawaii and Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. About half way between the islands and the California coast, the pitch of the destroyer’s starboard shaft — which connects the engine to the propeller — came out of alignment.
 In order to repair and calibrate, the ship would need to lock the shaft, meaning that for the duration of the maintenance the ship would be adrift.
 According to the investigation, the ship went dead in the water just after 10 a.m. A bridge watchstander soon called Bowen — who was not on the bridge — to ask if 3rd Fleet, the San Diego-based fleet in charge of the eastern Pacific Ocean, was aware the ship had stopped for repairs.
 “No, I don’t think they are aware,” Bowen responded, according to the investigation. When the crew member asked the captain if the fleet should be told, Bowen said not to worry about it, the sailor told investigators.
 The sailor remembered Bowen saying that the repairs wouldn’t take long so there was no need to worry about letting the fleet know they’d stopped.
 At 11:30 a.m., another sailor assumed the watch on the bridge. This sailor also called Bowen because 3rd Fleet was asking for the ship’s position, course and speed. The sailor recommended to Bowen that he be allowed to tell the fleet the Decatur was dead in the water for maintenance, but the captain again said not to do so, the investigation said.
 “After I hung up with the captain, I understood what he was saying,” the sailor told investigators, according to a transcript of an interview. “Basically, (to) provide ... where we would have been ... as if we were not (dead in the water). It just seemed a little awkward I guess....”
 The sailor called Bowen a second time to clarify the captain’s instructions, the sailor told investigators. During that call, he suggested to the captain that they just report to truth to the fleet.

 While he convalesces, Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to handle the nation's response to the pandemic that has infected at least 1.78 million worldwide and killed 109,000 people. Experts say those numbers seriously understate the impact of the pandemic, due to limited testing and different ways of counting the dead.
 Britain has been in effective lockdown since March 23 and the government is set to extend the restrictions sometime this week.
 But Johnson's Conservative government has come under fire for its slow response to confronting the pandemic — allowing tens of thousands to gather at the Cheltenham horse racing festival in mid-March, for example. It's also faced criticism for its slow rollout of a coronavirus testing program.
 Over the past few days, the government has also faced acute criticism for the lack of personal protective equipment for frontline workers in hospitals, amid reports that some nurses have had to resort to cutting up garbage bags to cover themselves.
 Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed Saturday that 19 frontline workers have died from the virus.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and Napoli head coach Maurizio Sarri believe each other are destined for glory after Tuesday's pulsating Champions League encounter at the Etihad Stadium.
 Premier League leaders City overcame their Serie A counterparts 2-1 in Group F, with early goals from Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus ultimately proving the difference.
 Guardiola's men appeared on course for another of the demolition jobs they have made their calling card in the Premier League this term but Napoli thrillingly rallied, pulling a goal back through Amadou Diawara's second-half penalty after Dries Mertens had an earlier spot-kick saved by Ederson.
 City held out in a tense finale but the memory of their opening salvo remained fresh in Sarri's mind as he told a post-match news conference the English club can shake off their previous missteps in Europe to challenge the continent's heavyweights.
 "It is a great team," Sarri said of Manchester City. "It has everything.
 "They are very quick, they are tactically very savvy and, if they stay in the kind of good mental and physical shape they are now, they really could go all the way."
 Guardiola was arguably even more gushing as he labelled Napoli "one of the best sides I faced in my career, probably the best".
 As such, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss feels Juventus' Serie A hegemony could be set to come to an end this season.
 "That is a good question for Maurizio Sarri," he said when asked if Sarri's vibrant team can scoop the Scudetto. "I don't know.
 "I know Maurizio Sarri has a lot of respect for Juventus but if Napoli don't have too many injuries, with the way they play, of course they can win the league."
 In an impassioned post-match performance, Guardiola dedicated City's victory to Catalan politicians Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, who have been arrested on sedition charges.
 "We have shown in Catalonia that citizenship is bigger than any ideas," he added. "We hope they will be released soon."

Earlier this month, The Iron Ranger, a bar and restaurant on Grand Avenue in St. Paul received an order for sandwiches to be delivered to the University of Minnesota’s U Health Fairview hospital to feed the emergency room staff there.
 It just so happened that Lizzo, a Grammy Award winning pop singer, was responsible for the kind gesture. Lizzo, who began her career in Minneapolis, is known for songs such as, “Good as Hell,” “Truth Hurts”, “Juice” and “Tempo.”
 Tom Forti, the Hibbing native who owns The Iron Ranger, said since word got out he’s received calls from people reaching out to congratulate him on the order.
 “How Lizzo’s team chose me — of all the restaurants in town, I don’t know,” Forti said during a recent interview. “Of course, it’s a huge thing. It’s been a fun week.”
 Timing also couldn’t have been better for The Iron Ranger to get a little extra publicity, because like all others in the state, the eatery was forced to close to in-house dining last month by orders of Gov. Tim Walz as a measure to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. This week, the governor extended the order to May 4.
 The Iron Ranger has been offering curbside pickup and delivery. Though this means he’s had to limit hours and reduce staff, Forti said he suspects that his restaurant will get through this crisis just fine.
 “It’s been an adjustment to say the least,” Forti said. “I would say that being a neighborhood establishment, we’re finding that our community is really supporting us and thanking us for staying open.”
 The publicity from the order placed by Lizzo is something Forti and Bella, his 11-year old daughter who helped him get it ready, will be able to reminisce about long after the pandemic is over.
 When the order came in, Forti said he didn’t even realize who had placed it as he was focused on details.
 “I got an email on Sunday morning and I was more concerned about what needs to be made, where it needs to be delivered and that it gets there on time,” Forti said.
 A photo of the emergency room staff, holding their sandwiches and thanking Lizzo circulated on the Citi Pages Facebook page, while raising the question of where did the pop star place the order.
 It turns out that the stickers used to seal the sandwich wrappers shut is what threw people off. That’s because stickers were from the Sunrise Market and Deli, the name of a business Forti owned prior to opening The Iron Ranger about two years ago.
 Mike Toldo, of Side Lake, helped solve the mystery when he identified the sandwiches as being from the Sunrise Deli in Hibbing.
 “I have eaten more than one of these treats,” Toldo wrote in the comment section of the Facebook post.
 About five years ago, after graduating from St. Thomas University, Forti joined his parents,Tom and Mary in their business, Sunrise Deli on First Avenue in Hibbing. About a year later, he moved to the Twin Cities area and entered the gluten free pasta market, and opened up the Sunrise Market in a warehouse in St. Paul.
 Once the space became available on Grand Avenue, Forti moved the business and opened The Iron Ranger. There one can find food reflecting the region’s Italian, Solvenian and Crotian and other food cultures, such as pasties, saramas, porketta and potica.
 The porketta, stromboli pasties and sarmas along with other items available at the Iron Ranger, are made by the Sunrise Deli in Hibbing. There’s also grocery items such as gnocchi, lasagna and are also sold there to be cooked at home. Bread and potica served at The Iron Ranger comes from Sunrise Bakery, also in Hibbing and is now owned by relative Paul Forti.
 Mary Forti appreciates the connection that’s developed between the Sunrise Deli that she and her husband run in Hibbing and the Iron Ranger in St. Paul.
 “It’s keeping our employees in Hibbing busy here,” Mary said.
 That’s especially true in the past month, because like many other restaurants on the Iron Range, the Sunrise Deli has experienced a decline in business since they were forced to limit dining to curbside, she said. The restaurant continues to offer daily specials, and also sells homemade pasta wholesale. But take-out orders from workers at area businesses have also decreased. Mary said she and her husband have had to make the difficult decision to reduce their staff as a result.
 Paul Forti said one of the things he’s enjoyed about owning The Iron Ranger the past two years is getting to meet Iron Rangers — whether they still reside in Hibbing or elsewhere.
 With a stay at home order in place statewide, it’ll be a while before residents of the Iron Range will be making the trek to the restaurant in St. Paul; however they can still get a taste of what it has to offer at the Sunrise Deli in Hibbing.
 Sunrise Deli in Hibbing is open from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. for pick up. Orders may by calling 218-263-5713. Those hours are subject to change.

Johnson had been in the hospital for a week and had spent three nights in the intensive care unit. Earlier he said he owes his life to the National Health Service staff who treated him.
 “I can’t thank them enough,” Johnson said in his first public statement since he was moved out of intensive care Thursday night. “I owe them my life.”
 Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, said in tweets that she “cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough” and that she “will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.” She admitted there “were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones.”
 Johnson, 55, was the first world leader confirmed to have the illness. His coronavirus symptoms at first were said to have been mild, including a cough and a fever, and he was working from home during the first few days.
 But he was admitted to St. Thomas’ on April 5 after his condition worsened and he was transferred the following day to its intensive care unit, where he received oxygen but was not put onto a ventilator. He spent three nights there before moving back to a regular hospital ward.

NEW YORK (AP) — New York is wrapping up its worst week in deaths so far of the coronavirus outbreak, but there were a few signs of hope.
 THE NUMBERS
 At the end of the day Friday, there were 18,654 people hospitalized with the virus in the state. That was up only 85 since the previous day.
 The bad news has been that large numbers of people are still dying every day. Cuomo announced Saturday that 783 people died Friday, the fifth day in a row that the toll topped 700. The figures raised the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state to 8,627.
 WILL SCHOOLS STAY CLOSED?
 The governor and mayor could face more questions over whether school buildings in the nation’s largest district would close for the rest of the year, with classes continuing online.
 New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said the public school sites in the city’s 1.1 million-student school district would close for the rest of the academic year to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo countered that the decision was his to make.
 De Blasio said his goal to reopen school sites by September, adding that high school graduates may have to go without a commencement ceremony. But Cuomo said school closings would have to be coordinated with districts surrounding the city.

Oftentimes inspiration for my columns come from meetings or presentations that I attend, but those have been in short supply lately. Instead, I’ve reached out to various friends and acquaintances to describe their worst and best personal experiences since we’ve restricted our social interactions.
 For Fitz Grant, Sanford Community Center executive director, the best has been a sense that people are more caring, that because the virus crosses all social groups, everyone feels vulnerable and can see the need in our community now. The worst is that this has become a complete disruption of routine in our lives, and death has become a closer reality.
 I also spoke with Lottie J. Horn White, executive assistant to the CEO of the Twelve Clans Unity Hospital in Winnebago, Neb., who shared that the worst is the unknown. Because turnaround time for Covid-19 testing takes a couple of days, anytime someone is tested, the patient, their family members, all hospital personnel – everyone – is on edge, wondering if they’ve been exposed to the virus (none so far). Lottie told me that her best experience has been her son’s teachers checking in on him. He is autistic and has special needs; she commented on how his North Middle School teachers have been awesome.

Thomas W. McBrien Jr. of Carbon County, Pa. died peacefully on Thursday, March 26, 2020. He was a man of great faith, and was ready to go home.      Tom was married to Marie McBrien for 60 years.      He was the founder and former owner of Bucks County River Country.      He didn't have the opportunity for much formal education, yet he left a legacy mirroring the American Dream.

He was loved for his spirit to celebrate and bring people together and hosted the annual summer 'Sears Picnic' along his riverside home in Point Pleasant, Pa.      Tom was a dreamer and a visionary. Outdoors was where he loved most and from a couple family owned canoes from Sears, he and his wife birthed and successfully built one of the East Coasts largest River Recreation Outfitters. Known first as Point Pleasant Canoe Rentals, the business was their livelihood for 35 years before retiring and moving to Carbon County. At the height of the the business he had over 200 employees seasonally, mostly college students, teachers and school bus drivers. He loved the river and seeing families enjoying the great outdoors.      He went on to create other unique outdoor attractions such as The Haunted Woods Hayrides and Pumpkin Patch Hayride. He had renovated, owned and managed the Indian Rock Inn in Bucks County, Pa.      He and Marie would later move to Carbon County, Weatherly, Pa. From timber on his land he built two beautiful state of the art log cabins which are named Brookside Lodges. His family continues to rent them today as he wanted to share his piece of paradise with others.      Tom was a larger than life man and grateful of his good fortune. He was caring and knew he was blessed, sharing generously through donations and support in both communities that he lived. He was always helping people out. He and his wife opened their home fostering boys in trouble and he sponsored a school in the Philippines.      Born in Philadelphia, Pa., he was the only son of an Irish Immigrant, the late Tom and Mary McBrien. He was the youngest sibling alongside three sisters.

Bowen told investigators he told the bridge not to tell the fleet they were dead in the water but denied telling his crew to report false coordinates to the fleet.
 “I don’t understand the benefit of not telling them our position,” Bowen told investigators. “OK, we don’t tell them that we’re going (dead in the water) to do a (pitch calibration). OK, that’s fine. But why do we need to falsify our position? That doesn’t make any sense to me.”
 Bowen also denied telling his crew to turn off automatic tracking equipment.
 The irregularities were reported to the Navy via an anonymous hotline complaint shortly after the ship returned to San Diego. The Navy launched its investigation in November, and Bowen was fired as commanding officer in January.
 At the time, the Navy said in a press release that Bowen was relieved of duty due to a “loss of confidence in his ability to command.”
 On Friday, Cmdr. John Fage, a 3rd Fleet spokesman, said the Navy holds its leaders to a high standard.
 “Their positions require the utmost in responsibility, reliability and leadership, and the Navy holds them accountable in cases where they fall short of those standards,” Fage said.
 Bowen’s tenure in command of the Decatur included another headline-grabbing incident.
 In October 2018, a Chinese destroyer made what the Navy called “aggressive maneuvers” toward the Decatur near the Gaven Reef in the South China Sea, coming within 45 yards of the Decatur, the Navy said.
