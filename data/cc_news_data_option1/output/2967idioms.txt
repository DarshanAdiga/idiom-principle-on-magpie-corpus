Residents of Gulistan-e-Jauhar demand compensation for their rain-related losses as they grapple with the aftermath of Sunday's rainfall that wreaked havoc in the locality. On Sunday, dozens of cars swept away in rainwater, motorcycles fell in drains and houses flooded with rainwater and sewage, incurring millions of rupees loss to residents of the area.


  Meanwhile, the Cantonment Board Faisal (CBF), Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) played blame game with each other regarding whose responsibility it was to clean the drains.


  The rainwater gushed inside the Sindh Baloch Society in Gulistan-e-Jauhar Block 12 under the administrative control of the CBF, breaking down a K-Electric (KE) pole and a wall, separating the society with a shanty town.


  As the RCC wall collapsed, it fell on a rickshaw, causing injuries to a man and his children. "The ambulance could not enter the area and the family was taken to hospital in another rickshaw," said one of the residents of the society, Uzair. "The water entered with so much pressure in the society that it dismantled everything it came in its way."


  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf president of Gulistan-e-Jauhar Block 12 Shakeel Ahmed told The News how the nullah from coming from Gulistan-e-Jauhar Block 14 towards Block 12 overflowed.


  "The nullah falls in the Malir River at Pehelwan Goth," he said, adding that despite repeated complaints, the authorities did not clean it before the rainfall. According to Ahmed, On Monday, two tractors were deployed at the large drain in front of Rabia City by PTI MPA Bilal Ghafar.


  As many as 40 apartments of Sana Apartments near Rado Bakery were completely inundated with the rainwater. "Water gushed inside the apartment building as if a dam had broken," recalled one of the residents. "All bikes and cars parked inside were half drowned." Even by Monday, power could not be restored at the meter room of the apartment that was flooded with the rainwater that resulted in sparks and blasts.


  A team of K-Electric, according to one of the union members of the apartment, Sameer, fixed the meters but as soon as they left, there were again sparks and blasts, and the apartments plunged into darkness.


  "Almost 10 years back the apartments were flooded, but this time, it was unprecedented," he said, adding that the families residing inside the apartment incurred millions of rupees losses and no government official had even paid a visit. He demanded compensation from the government for their losses.


  Scores of cars that had been parked outside the apartment on Sunday had to have their seats and dashboards dismantled. Ali opened his car's bonnet to find that the engine was filled in water. "Let's just pray that water did not damage the engine," he said, adding that the car's interior was destroyed.


  Another resident of Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Humayun Ahmed Khan, lamented how his motorcycle swept away in the gushing water and was beyond repair now. The elected councillor of Muttahida Qaumi Movement of Gulistan-e-Jauhar's ward number five in the CBF told The News how the drains were not the responsibility of the cantonment board, but the KWSB. Meanwhile, a KWSB assistant executive engineer put the blame on the KMC and CBF and said that the drains were never the responsibility of the KWSB.


  A KMC officer said the drains in the cantonment areas were not their responsibility.

He demanded from the government to make an urgent cut in petroleum prices that would bring down the business cost and reduce inflation providing great relief to the common man. He said that business community and people were already facing great hardships due to the devastations of Covid-19 pandemic but instead of taking relief measures for them in these difficult times, the government had increased the prices of petroleum products by 27 to 66 per cent in the last week of June that further increased the difficulties of businesses and the general public.


  He said that in light of current tough conditions, the government should have taken steps to reduce the manufacturing cost and promote ease of doing business so that our economy could recover fast. But instead of taking relief measures, government increased the problems by making unnecessary hike in petroleum prices. He said that the industrial sector uses furnace oil in factories while the transport and agricultural sectors are using diesel so the reduction in prices of petrol and diesel will alleviate the problems of these sectors and bring down inflation as well.


  The ICCI President said that the government has made the petroleum products an important source of revenue collection which is not justified. He said the government is currently collecting an amount of Rs47 on per litre of petrol and diesel in the form of sales tax and petroleum levy. He urged that government should reduce heavy taxes on petroleum products to provide relief to businesses and the people. He further said that most of the electricity in Pakistan is generated from furnace oil due to which its price is almost highest in the region.

Spartanburg and the rest of the Upstate are in the grips of a heat wave that shows no signs of letting up soon.


   


  Of course, it's July, and it's supposed to be hot. The normal daytime high for the Greenville-Spartanburg area in July is 90 degrees.


   


  But since July 10, temperatures have met or exceeded the normal high. Monday and Tuesday reached 95 degrees, and Wednesday topped off at 93 degrees before afternoon thunderstorms cooled it down.


   


  Above-normal is now the norm.


   


  A stubborn high-pressure system over the Southeast has barely budged, allowing daytime temperatures to soar.


   


  It's the "hit or miss" afternoon storms that will provide any relief during the week ahead, according to meteorologist Andrew Kimball of the National Weather Service at Greer.


   


  "Beyond seven days, forecast models are not hinting at a pattern change," Kimball said.


   


  Heat index values will approach 100 Sunday, then into the low 100s by Tuesday. The index is a combination of heat and humidity that produces a real- feel temperature.


   


  One thing that could change the pattern is a tropical storm. Gonzalo is forecast to approach Jamaica in the Caribbean by Tuesday, then into the Gulf of Mexico. Where it heads next is still unknown.


   


  "It's still a ways out," Kimball said.


   


  The hottest July on record at Greenville-Spartanburg was in 1993 when the average temperature (high and low) was 83.2 degrees. The record high of 107 degrees was also reached during that heat wave from July 1 through July 23.


   


  That year also holds the record of 38 consecutive 90-plus days from June 27 to Aug. 3, Kimball said.


   


  The most 90-plus degree days in a year was 88 in 2011.


   


  More recently, a heat wave from June 23 to July 29, 2012, broke records from Colorado all the way to the East Coast, with at least 82 reported deaths, according to the National Weather Service. Columbia had 11 days with highs of 100 degrees and back-to-back days of 109 degrees.


   


  Despite the current heat wave, rainfall totals for the year are about 20 inches above normal -- meaning that stream and lake levels have yet to fall, and no drought advisories have been issued.


   


  "Some parts of the state are starting to see drier-than-normal conditions, which is a concern for some farmers," said Eva Moore, spokeswoman for the S.C. Department of Agriculture. "But it's been a pretty good summer so far, with bountiful summer vegetables being harvested and livestock doing well."


   


  Duke Energy spokesman Ryan Mosier said heat waves generally result in higher energy bills as customers run air conditioners and fans continuously.


   


  Ways to reduce energy usage include changing air filters regularly, setting the thermostat at the highest comfortable setting, closing blinds and drapes during the hottest part of the day, and grilling outdoors instead of cooking in the oven or stovetop.


   


  Meanwhile, the American Red Cross South Carolina Region offers tips for residents to stay safe and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  In public, keep at least 6 feet between yourself and others; wear face coverings especially in crowded areas; do not place masks on children under the age of 2.


   


  At the pool or beach, wear face coverings on land, but not in the water; don't share goggles, nose clips or snorkels; always supervise young children.


   


  Health care providers continue to work extended hours in the outdoor heat to make COVID-19 testing available to residents, according to Laura Renwick, spokeswoman for the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control.


   


  "We've been preparing for hot temperatures for several weeks and are working to ensure that workers at testing events have shade, water, periods of rest, and backups that can help them rotate and take regular breaks," Renwick said.


   


  "The summer heat poses a new challenge but we are committed to taking care of the health care providers -- who can't help others unless they help themselves."

New Delhi The Indian Navy has stepped up surveillance and activities in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), which, it believes, China will "inevitably" try to enter in its quest to become a global power, just as it has laid claim to large portions of the disputed South China Sea, according to a top officer aware of the developments.It is to deal with this scenario that India reached out to neighbours in IOR -- Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar, to prevent China from expanding its footprint in the region by creating more bases -- and like-minded navies, such as those of the United States and Japan, over the last two months, he added."It is inevitable that the Chinese People's Liberation Army-Navy (PLAN) will come to IOR if China wants to become a global power. They are opening multiple routes to the Indian Ocean to overcome the Malacca Dilemma (China's strategic weakness)," the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The comments come at a time when there are heightened military tensions in eastern Ladakh -- where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has turned out to be a challenging process -- and China is militarising the South China Sea. The Malacca Dilemma refers to China's apprehension of major naval powers controlling the Malacca Strait between Malaysia and Indonesia and interdicting vital supply lines. A significant volume (more than 80%) of China's oil imports pass through the strait connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The multiple routes that China could be looking at to enter the Indian Ocean are further south of Malacca and include the Sunda, Lombok, Ombai and Wetar straits, said a second Indian Navy officer who asked not to be named."It's a reality that the PLAN will deploy in the Indian Ocean once its power crosses a certain threshold. Right now, it's good enough for the South China Sea," said Admiral Arun Prakash (retd), a former navy chief. India is keeping tabs on China's aggressive moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the Chinese navy doesn't muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity, said the first officer. Over the last one month, the navy has conducted joint drills with a US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, and Indian and Japanese warships have carried out exercises in the Indian Ocean, against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff in Ladakh. The India-US exercise involving eight Indian and US warships took place a week ago at a time when tensions have mounted over China's activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy recently conducted a major exercise that involved two carrier strike groups. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean region, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China's rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing's power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. "China is claiming almost 90% of the South China Sea. We don't want that scenario unfolding in the Indian Ocean. We will not allow China to have it easy coming here," said the second officer. China's step-by-step inroads into "territorialising" the South China Sea find echoes in some parts of IOR, not by trumped up claims because that would be blatant neo-colonialism but with more sophistication, said naval affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd) "Its (China's) diplomacy and economic influence when combined with port investments, logistics bases, all of which could be for dual-use and their sustained deployments in the IOR, are of serious concern," Shrikhande said. The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year. China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue, or Quad, that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year. "We are already operating with these navies. We don't need time to put the Quad into effect if the government gives us the go- ahead… It's not that we are aligning with the US. Our actions are guided by national interest and what you see unfolding is issue-based convergence of interests," said the first officer. China began deploying troops to its first overseas naval base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa in July 2017, in what some global experts said was the outcome of Beijing's 'debt-trap diplomacy'. Mounting debts have led countries such as Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Pakistan to give control of territories, which are of strategic significance, to China. The base in Djibouti has shored up China's capabilities to sustain naval units in the Indian Ocean. "In recent months, with much of the world preoccupied with the Covid-19 pandemic, China has sharply escalated its coercive activities. In early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat close to islands claimed by both China and Vietnam. A Chinese marine survey vessel harassed a Malaysian oil exploration vessel off Borneo. This month, the [US] department of defense voiced concern about the Chinese navy's decision to seal off an area around the Paracel Islands to conduct naval exercises. In response, the United States increased its own naval activities, including joint exercises by two aircraft carrier groups," the New York Times said in an editorial on Monday.The Indian Navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points and the vessels could be diverted for any mission. Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.While the Indian Navy is keeping a sharp eye on the Indian Ocean, it is also playing a key role in the Ladakh sector. The navy's P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, imported from the US, are being used for surveillance of the Ladakh sector and gathering intelligence on Chinese deployments across the contested LAC. The primary role of the P-8Is encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of the oceans.

We struggle to find a way to cope with a phenomenon which occurs regularly and is a routine part of annual life. Karachi has been devastated by heavy rain over the last week with streets flooded with water, making them impassable for vehicles or pedestrians, five people dying as a result of electrocution, flights being cancelled and prolonged power shutdowns suffered by people with K-Electric stating either that it is trying to remedy the problem or that it has deliberately turned off power to prevent electrocution. The decision by municipal committees to clean drains only in July has meant sewerage and waste from sewers have been left piled up along roads adding to the misery of people.
 We cannot attribute this to a 'natural disaster'. It is the utter mismanagement of our larger cities over a prolonged period of time by successive governments which has led to this. In Karachi's case, the neglect has been unreal and tragic. Worst of all, a blame game has been played each time this happened. We are seeing it again today. But the fact is that all governments that have run Karachi over the last many decades are equally responsible. It is pointless to try and point the finger at each other. Instead all the stakeholders including city planners and citizens who run groups working for civic welfare, alongside the mayor and government and the bodies which manage the daily affairs of Karachi need to sit down together and decide what is to be done.
 The situation has continued year after year. It has now reached a point where it will be impossible to solve it without building a consensus within which everyone works together. There should be no need for Karachi to be reduced to a complete state of pandemonium with life suspended each time it experiences heavy rain. All authorities and all political parties need to work together despite their differences in order to solve this problem.

They are opening multiple routes to the Indian Ocean to overcome the Malacca Dilemma (China's strategic weakness)," the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
 The comments come at a time when there are heightened military tensions in eastern Ladakh -- where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has turned out to be a challenging process -- and China is militarising the South China Sea.
 The Malacca Dilemma refers to China's apprehension of major naval powers controlling the Malacca Strait between Malaysia and Indonesia and interdicting vital supply lines. A significant volume (more than 80%) of China's oil imports pass through the strait connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.
 The multiple routes that China could be looking at to enter the Indian Ocean are further south of Malacca and include the Sunda, Lombok, Ombai and Wetar straits, said a second Indian Navy officer who asked not to be named.
 "It's a reality that the PLAN will deploy in the Indian Ocean once its power crosses a certain threshold. Right now, it's good enough for the South China Sea," said Admiral Arun Prakash (retd), a former navy chief.
 India is keeping tabs on China's aggressive moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the Chinese navy doesn't muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the- clock surveillance for any unusual activity, said the first officer.
 Over the last one month, the navy has conducted joint drills with a US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, and Indian and Japanese warships have carried out exercises in the Indian Ocean, against the backdrop of the India- China border standoff in Ladakh.
 The India-US exercise involving eight Indian and US warships took place a week ago at a time when tensions have mounted over China's activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy recently conducted a major exercise that involved two carrier strike groups.
 From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean region, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China's rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing's power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean.
 "China is claiming almost 90% of the South China Sea. We don't want that scenario unfolding in the Indian Ocean. We will not allow China to have it easy coming here," said the second officer.
 China's step-by-step inroads into "territorialising" the South China Sea find echoes in some parts of IOR, not by trumped up claims because that would be blatant neo-colonialism but with more sophistication, said naval affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd)
 "Its (China's) diplomacy and economic influence when combined with port investments, logistics bases, all of which could be for dual-use and their sustained deployments in the IOR, are of serious concern," Shrikhande said.
 The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.
 China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue, or Quad, that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.
 "We are already operating with these navies. We don't need time to put the Quad into effect if the government gives us the go-ahead… It's not that we are aligning with the US. Our actions are guided by national interest and what you see unfolding is issue-based convergence of interests," said the first officer.
 China began deploying troops to its first overseas naval base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa in July 2017, in what some global experts said was the outcome of Beijing's 'debt-trap diplomacy'. Mounting debts have led countries such as Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Pakistan to give control of territories, which are of strategic significance, to China.
 The base in Djibouti has shored up China's capabilities to sustain naval units in the Indian Ocean.
 "In recent months, with much of the world preoccupied with the Covid-19 pandemic, China has sharply escalated its coercive activities. In early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat close to islands claimed by both China and Vietnam. A Chinese marine survey vessel harassed a Malaysian oil exploration vessel off Borneo. This month, the [US] department of defense voiced concern about the Chinese navy's decision to seal off an area around the Paracel Islands to conduct naval exercises. In response, the United States increased its own naval activities, including joint exercises by two aircraft carrier groups," the New York Times said in an editorial on Monday.
 The Indian Navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points and the vessels could be diverted for any mission.
 Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.
 While the Indian Navy is keeping a sharp eye on the Indian Ocean, it is also playing a key role in the Ladakh sector.
 The navy's P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, imported from the US, are being used for surveillance of the Ladakh sector and gathering intelligence on Chinese deployments across the contested LAC.
 The primary role of the P-8Is encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of the oceans.

There are many great dogs and cats currently waiting for their forever humans at Suncoast Humane Society. Among the many are Buddy and Raven.


  Buddy came to our shelter on Oct. 1, 2019, due to his owner having health issues and not being able to care for Buddy anymore. This 8-year-old guy loves to go on adventures, whether it is to the park for a run, in the car for a ride, or on a boat for a day out on the water.


  This good boy knows how to be a great member of the family and a respectful companion with house and crate training under his invisible doggy belt. Buddy likes meeting other dogs, but can be picky about cats. He’s talkative and knows all his basic commands. If you like to explore the world and are longing for a fun, loving and very handsome companion, Buddy has cleared his schedule and is ready to meet you. Buddy has been waiting for his forever adventure to start for 10 months, and his adoption fee is only $25.


  Raven arrived at our shelter Dec. 4, 2019, when her previous owner’s young child developed allergies. Not having the option to move to a bigger place in an effort to keep Raven in a separate space, Raven’s owner had to make the heartbreaking choice to seek help in finding Raven a new great home. Raven is 4 years old and she is used to being the queen of her castle.


  This sweet girl can be shy at first, but don’t let that affect your desire to get to know her better, because once she opens up to you, you’ll get so much love! She loves to be petted and told sweet nothings. She’ll even let you hold her, but not for too long … This kitty would rather engage in some play time and show you her active side.


  When Raven is all tuckered out from zooming around, she’ll come to your bed for snuggles at night. Raven has been hopeful to meet her new forever family for nine months, and her adoption fee is also only $25.


  If you would like to give Buddy or Raven the greatest gift of a happily forever after, please call Suncoast Humane Society at 941-474-7884 to make an appointment. The shelter is located at 6781 San Casa Drive, Englewood.


  To view all animals waiting for their forever homes, visit www.humane.org. All animals available for adoption are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, microchipped, dewormed and tested for heartworm disease.


  If you would like to help, but cannot adopt, consider becoming a foster or a monthly donor. Fostering saves lives, and with monthly giving you can make a big impact with a small monthly donation to help thousands of animals each year.

The minister said this on Monday as he along with senior officials visited several affected areas of the city in the aftermath of the downpour. He, however, conceded that the situation in the city had not been normal up to a 100 per cent but said that “there is no doubt that the Sindh government’s representatives have been present on the ground among their people during the difficult time”.


  “All of our municipal officials, up to the level of secretary local government and managing directors of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, have been constantly in touch with the people and their staffers and have been taking doing their work,” he said.


  “We have no hesitation to state that the situation could have been a lot more adverse, had the Sindh government not taken timely steps of de-silting of the storm water drains in the city,” he added. “The provincial leaders have been doing their best to overcome this situation of the natural calamity," he said.


  The minister appealed to the people that they should not venture outside their homes without any necessity as they should stay away from the electricity poles for their safety. He said the new spell of monsoon rain was even more torrential than the previous one. He said whether it was the issue of de-silting of storm water drains or the ritual of sacrificing animals over Eid-ul-Azha, the government had always taken on board the city’s municipal leadership to finalise the strategy.


  Nasir claimed that the government for the last several months had been acting upon a comprehensive and composite strategy to deal with any eventuality with regard to monsoon rains.


  “However, the human will could do nothing against the situation of these torrential rains and other natural calamities. Even the developed countries get affected by heavy rains,” he said. Meanwhile, the minister visited Surjani Town, Gulbuhar, Orangi Town, New Karachi, North Nazimabad and other areas to review the drainage of accumulated rainwater and urban flooding.

A very good example is the case of Michael DeAngelo Davis (reg. #24604-077), a black federal prisoner. In 1993, Mr. Davis was convicted of Hobbs Act Robbery. At sentencing the government asked the court to stack on an additional five years for a gun that didn't really exist. And just for good measure the government asked the court to illegally apply a second sentence, of 25 years as though Mr. Davis was a second time offender under the gun law, even though he was a first-time offender. The court granted the government's request and sentenced Mr. Davis to 38+ years in federal prison.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Global air travel is recovering more slowly than expected and it will take until 2024 to return to pre-pandemic levels, the trade association for the airline industry said Tuesday.The International Air Transport Association pushed back its prediction by one year due to the slow containment of the outbreak in the U.S. and in developing countries.The industry is seeing a rebound from the depths of the shutdowns in April, but the bad news is that any increase “is barely visible,” IATA chief economist Brian Pearce said during an online briefing for journalists.Pearce said that air travel is not rebounding along with rising levels of business confidence in Europe, the U.S. and China. Traffic was down 86.5% in June from the same month a year ago, compared with a drop of 94.1% in April, measured as revenue passenger kilometers, or the distance traveled by all revenue- generating passengers.That improvement is “nowhere near the increase in business confidence,” Pearce said. China is bouncing back more than some other places, while an upturn in the U.S. has been knocked back by the recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases in a number of states.Besides renewed outbreaks, travel is also being held back by weak consumer confidence and constrained travel budgets at companies that are struggling.“Furthermore, there is little sign of virus containment in many important emerging economies, which in combination with the U.S., represent around 40% of global air travel markets,” IATA said in a statement. “Their continued closure, particularly to international travel, is a significant drag on recovery.”Despite parking many of their planes, airlines are struggling to fill seats with enough people to make money. Planes were only 62.9% full on domestic flights around the world, well below levels at which airlines make money, and an abysmal 38.9% for international travel.The U.S. is seeing more coronavirus cases after some states moved to lift restrictions on public life and business. The summer vacation season in Europe has seen more people move around. There has been a rise in cases in Germany, which had earlier done better than many other countries in mitigating the outbreak.Germany has issued a travel warning for three regions in Spain and the U.K. has imposed a 14-day quarantine for travelers returning from Spain, a popular holiday destination.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

 Sears said he wanted to give his thanks to the town crews for the good work they are doing in cleaning up properties and also with work on water lines that will help the town save money in the long run because of leaks. He said that some of these lines had been patched as many as 10-12 times. He also said they had found lines that had been disconnected with no caps that were leaking.
 Ted Maze of the Oolitic Fire Department asked for approval of a road block for the fire department Sept. 19. It was approved. He also told the council the fire department would be hosting hazardous materials training Sept. 12 and Oct. 12, with some of the Monroe County rural fire departments. He said training would be at the fire station, behind town hall, and maybe a couple of other locations.
 Dave Brown asked the council about its ordinances in regards to off-road vehicles being operated within town limits and on town streets. He said the local ordinances do not coincide with state code and he felt that it would be best if local code and state code were the same.
 Sears said, when the code was written a few years ago, it was a very hot topic, with many people on both sides of the issue. He said the council tried to work out a compromise, but it might be worth revisiting the issue. He said he would have the town attorney and the town marshals go over the ordinances and see what could be done.
 Bill Hanners, representing Lawrence County Indiana Bikers and Toys for Tots campaign, presented the council with a plaque for its support in the past and asked if they would still be able to have a roadblock in Oolitic this year. The council said he needed to choose a date and get it approved by the council, but they could have a roadblock this year. They added the town had added some safety precautions to the roadblock ordinance and they would have to comply with those.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday remarked that the chief minister (CM) is expected to tour different parts of the state and meet the people, but in the case of Uddhav Thackeray, he is yet to commence his visits. Pawar also said that as he keeps travelling, he is in fact more visible than the CM himself.
 The NCP leader made the statements during an interview with a Marathi news channel.
 "I don't think that the CM is failing to take everyone into confidence. He speaks to everyone. But the only difference is that I'm more visible, as I keep travelling. He [Thackeray] doesn't travel and works from one place," Pawar replied when he was asked about the disputes within the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government based on claims of Thackeray not taking everyone into confidence.
 "Being head of the government, he [CM] is expected to monitor and function from one place, but it doesn't mean that he should do so permanently. In between, he is also expected to tour the state after taking some time out from his schedule, meet people and take them into confidence, which [in this case] is yet to happen," the veteran leader added.
 The remarks are opposite to the statement made by the former Union minister on Saturday, when he defended the CM for not visiting the other areas of the state amid the Covid-19 crisis. Pawar then said that the leaders urged the CM to oversee and monitor the functioning of his team from one place. He had also praised Thackeray and said that the CM is working day and night to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak as one-point agenda.
 Pawar has been visiting various districts and reviewing the preparations by local authorities, along with health minister Rajesh Tope, to contain the outbreak. On Saturday, he was in Aurangabad city to take stock of the situation and to launch the 'Mission Zero--Aurangabad' campaign to bring the death rate to zero in the city.
 On Friday, the 79-year old leader was at Nashik, while earlier that week on July 20, he was in Solapur district to review the measures taken to control the Covid-19 situation.
 Maharashtra has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the country. The surge in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks in several cities and districts outside Mumbai has been a cause of concern for the state.

 On Friday, July 24, schools in Monroe County received an email from Penny Caudill, Monroe County Health Department administrator, that said it “would not be unreasonable to consider going to your ‘plan B’ while we monitor this situation” of an increase in COVID-19 cases.

  Online learning works better for teens and tweens than kindergartners. And a solid foundation in the earliest grades is critical to students' long-term success. So education leaders should make our youngest students -- including young English learners -- a priority this school year and during the next legislative session.


  A Texas Education Agency report found that this past spring, pre-K and kindergarten students -- as well as children of color and lower-income kids -- were less engaged in distance learning. The fact is, our youngest kids learn best through hands-on engagement with teachers attentive to their needs and face-to-face interactions with other kids to build social skills. That's especially true for writing and language development in early grades.


  Even if a teacher can design a Zoom call for a kindergartner who has a computer and internet access, it only works if a parent can serve as the IT department and teaching aide. I struggled to keep my third grader on task while working from home this spring, and he was completely disinterested in the class activities offered via Zoom. The challenge is even greater for parents who work outside the home, are still learning English, struggle with online technology, or have younger kids.


  We also know from brain science that early childhood education is the foundation for later success. That's why, when the Legislature set a goal last year of making sure more kids are strong readers by third grade, they wisely invested in full-day pre-K and strong dual language education in early grades.


  While these early years are important for all students, they're particularly important for putting English learners on a path to become strong readers and fluent in both English and their home language. This is the age range when the brain is most ready and able to acquire two or more languages. With English learners accounting for more than a quarter of Texas students in kindergarten through second grade, meeting their academic needs is critical for meeting the state's education goals.


  We know many districts simply can't open their school doors on day one because of COVID. In those cases, districts should make distance learning as effective as possible in these early grades for students of all linguistic backgrounds.


  But when school leaders, teachers and health experts agree that it's safe for a portion of the student body to attend school in person, districts should first offer that option to families of our youngest students. The Austin Public Health Medical Director recently made the same recommendation, echoing national experts. Other students to prioritize for on-campus learning include kids with disabilities, students who lack technology or other resources at home and young English Learners.


  Since meeting outdoors may reduce the risk of the virus spreading, administrators should prioritize the youngest students for a district's outdoor classroom, even if it's just a spot under a leafy oak tree. Similarly, as smaller class sizes will help young children learn safely, districts should leverage child care centers, public libraries or high schools for extra space needs.


  To help make distance learning more effective and in-person learning safer, state and federal leaders should provide additional funding to districts. Districts need resources to train educators on using digital learning platforms for young children. And lawmakers, superintendents and principals should open up lines of communication with families of our youngest students -- including parents who don't speak English or don't use email -- to hear their concerns and feedback.


  Even after school is back to normal, the educational impact of this disruption will persist for years. State leaders will need to use the next legislative session to ensure young English learners and other young students are on a strong educational track.

Online learning works better for teens and tweens than kindergartners. And a solid foundation in the earliest grades is critical to students' long-term success. So education leaders should make our youngest students -- including young English learners -- a priority this school year and during the next legislative session.


   


  A Texas Education Agency report found that this past spring, pre-K and kindergarten students -- as well as children of color and lower-income kids -- were less engaged in distance learning. The fact is, our youngest kids learn best through hands-on engagement with teachers attentive to their needs and face-to-face interactions with other kids to build social skills. That's especially true for writing and language development in early grades.


   


  Even if a teacher can design a Zoom call for a kindergartner who has a computer and internet access, it only works if a parent can serve as the IT department and teaching aide. I struggled to keep my third grader on task while working from home this spring, and he was completely disinterested in the class activities offered via Zoom. The challenge is even greater for parents who work outside the home, are still learning English, struggle with online technology, or have younger kids.


   


  We also know from brain science that early childhood education is the foundation for later success. That's why, when the Legislature set a goal last year of making sure more kids are strong readers by third grade, they wisely invested in full-day pre-K and strong dual language education in early grades.


   


  While these early years are important for all students, they're particularly important for putting English learners on a path to become strong readers and fluent in both English and their home language. This is the age range when the brain is most ready and able to acquire two or more languages. With English learners accounting for more than a quarter of Texas students in kindergarten through second grade, meeting their academic needs is critical for meeting the state's education goals.


   


  We know many districts simply can't open their school doors on day one because of COVID. In those cases, districts should make distance learning as effective as possible in these early grades for students of all linguistic backgrounds.


   


  But when school leaders, teachers and health experts agree that it's safe for a portion of the student body to attend school in person, districts should first offer that option to families of our youngest students. The Austin Public Health Medical Director recently made the same recommendation, echoing national experts. Other students to prioritize for on-campus learning include kids with disabilities, students who lack technology or other resources at home and young English Learners.


   


  Since meeting outdoors may reduce the risk of the virus spreading, administrators should prioritize the youngest students for a district's outdoor classroom, even if it's just a spot under a leafy oak tree. Similarly, as smaller class sizes will help young children learn safely, districts should leverage child care centers, public libraries or high schools for extra space needs.


   


  To help make distance learning more effective and in-person learning safer, state and federal leaders should provide additional funding to districts. Districts need resources to train educators on using digital learning platforms for young children. And lawmakers, superintendents and principals should open up lines of communication with families of our youngest students -- including parents who don't speak English or don't use email -- to hear their concerns and feedback.


   


  Even after school is back to normal, the educational impact of this disruption will persist for years. State leaders will need to use the next legislative session to ensure young English learners and other young students are on a strong educational track.

A temporary reprieve from utility payments and disconnections is coming to an end for Cleveland County residents.


   


  Utility companies have been prohibited since March 31 from charging late fees or cutting service to people who haven't paid their bills. But those consumer protections are likely ending Wednesday when a North Carolina governor's executive order expires.


   


  Customers were still responsible for their bills during the moratorium but were given a reprieve as unemployment soared and many people were laid off or temporarily out of work as a result of the state-wide stay-at-home order enforced to contain the spread of COVID-19.


   


  The city of Shelby is encouraging customers to call now and begin setting up payment plans.


   


  Although customers have at least six months to pay overdue utility bills that accrued between March 31 to July 29, many residents continue to face financial challenges.


   


  As of May, the unemployment rate in the county was still 12.7 percent according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.


   


  North Carolinians are facing significant job loss and lack of wages as a result of COVID-19. Jobs may be slow to return, keeping North Carolinians under financial strain even as more businesses reopen. According to a recent University of Chicago study, 42 percent of coronavirus-related job losses aren't expected to come back.


   


  Rick Howell, Shelby city manager, said he does not have a number of that debt because it is difficult to determine.


   


  The weather and other factors impact how much customers owe on their accounts making it a challenge to compare one year to another.


   


  He emphasized that residents must pay those bills, and the city will continue to make collection attempts even after the six months is up.


   


  "We don't write that money off if you go beyond that collection period," Howell said.


   


  Overdue accounts will go to debt collection agencies, and tax refunds can be intercepted and applied toward overdue accounts.


   


  Howell said the goal is to collect as much as possible in as reasonable amount of time as possible.


   


  He said the city has a good track record of working with customers but at the same time, they have an obligation to provide services to all residents and must have the funds to continue to do so.


   


  "We have a good track record of working with customers and at same time we have an obligation toward all customers so the system can be operated... we will be working with customers closely on that," he said.


   


  The late fees and the fees associated with using a debit or credit card will also be reinstated.


   


  "Since we've had the facility closed, the city has paid the fees associated with debit and credit cards," he said.


   


  Those fees go to a third party which hosts the online payment platform used by the city.


   


  "We felt somewhat obligated since many may not pay with debit or credit cards," Howell said. "We didn't want to shoulder them with that burden, but once the building is back open and they can come in and pay, we're going to start tacking those charges on for debit and credit cards."


   


  Howell said the city has been posting information about setting up payment plans on social media, advertisements and media releases trying to get the information out to customers.


   


  There will also be an outdoor kiosk set up at the back of City Hall on Washington Street so people can make payments at any time.


   


  "We want to work with our customers. We want to be fair, and we want to treat them with respect but at the end of the day our utilities are run as separate enterprises and they have to support themselves," Howell said. "We have the same cost to operate the system now as we did before the pandemic began. We're going to be understanding with our customers and work with them as best as we possibly can. Our goal is to certainly not cut people off because we want people to use the system."


   


  Customers can contact the city's customer services department at 704-484-6866 for more information on setting up a payment arrangement.

Describing Monday's heavy downpour as a "situation of natural calamity", Sindh Information and Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said the provincial ministers were doing public service in Karachi since the previous night's heavy rain spell but at the same time "certain miscreants via twitter accounts and social media pages have been engaged in mud-slinging against" the conduct of the ministers.


  The minister said this on Monday as he along with senior officials visited several affected areas of the city in the aftermath of the downpour. He, however, conceded that the situation in the city had not been normal up to a 100 per cent but said that "there is no doubt that the Sindh government's representatives have been present on the ground among their people during the difficult time".


  "All of our municipal officials, up to the level of secretary local government and managing directors of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, have been constantly in touch with the people and their staffers and have been taking doing their work," he said.


  "We have no hesitation to state that the situation could have been a lot more adverse, had the Sindh government not taken timely steps of de-silting of the storm water drains in the city," he added. "The provincial leaders have been doing their best to overcome this situation of the natural calamity," he said.


  The minister appealed to the people that they should not venture outside their homes without any necessity as they should stay away from the electricity poles for their safety. He said the new spell of monsoon rain was even more torrential than the previous one. He said whether it was the issue of de-silting of storm water drains or the ritual of sacrificing animals over Eid-ul-Azha, the government had always taken on board the city's municipal leadership to finalise the strategy.


  Nasir claimed that the government for the last several months had been acting upon a comprehensive and composite strategy to deal with any eventuality with regard to monsoon rains.


  "However, the human will could do nothing against the situation of these torrential rains and other natural calamities. Even the developed countries get affected by heavy rains," he said. Meanwhile, the minister visited Surjani Town, Gulbuhar, Orangi Town, New Karachi, North Nazimabad and other areas to review the drainage of accumulated rainwater and urban flooding.

We know that extreme weather can create havoc. Earthquakes have been known to wipe out entire cities, cyclones have caused floods which have destroyed communities and avalanches have pushed entire villages into non-existence. But in general terms rain, which falls in most parts of the world in one form or the other, should not be creating so much peril. In some parts of the world, heavy showers are a daily fact of life. In areas affected by the monsoon - such as Pakistan - we experience heavy rainfall almost each year in late summer.
 We struggle to find a way to cope with a phenomenon which occurs regularly and is a routine part of annual life. Karachi has been devastated by heavy rain over the last week with streets flooded with water, making them impassable for vehicles or pedestrians, five people dying as a result of electrocution, flights being cancelled and prolonged power shutdowns suffered by people with K-Electric stating either that it is trying to remedy the problem or that it has deliberately turned off power to prevent electrocution. The decision by municipal committees to clean drains only in July has meant sewerage and waste from sewers have been left piled up along roads adding to the misery of people.
 We cannot attribute this to a 'natural disaster'. It is the utter mismanagement of our larger cities over a prolonged period of time by successive governments which has led to this. In Karachi's case, the neglect has been unreal and tragic. Worst of all, a blame game has been played each time this happened. We are seeing it again today. But the fact is that all governments that have run Karachi over the last many decades are equally responsible. It is pointless to try and point the finger at each other. Instead all the stakeholders including city planners and citizens who run groups working for civic welfare, alongside the mayor and government and the bodies which manage the daily affairs of Karachi need to sit down together and decide what is to be done.
 The situation has continued year after year. It has now reached a point where it will be impossible to solve it without building a consensus within which everyone works together. There should be no need for Karachi to be reduced to a complete state of pandemonium with life suspended each time it experiences heavy rain. All authorities and all political parties need to work together despite their differences in order to solve this problem.
