"BCCI won't be able to earn the Rs 440 crore it was set to get from Vivo from another sponsor in this environment. This development is also a big blow for Star as Vivo will most probably stay away from advertising and other Chinese brands may follow suit considering the present anti-Chinese prevalent in the country right now," he told Moneycontrol.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in many changes to which we must all adapt. America's sportsmen and women, a group that I am proud to represent as a co- chair of the Florida Legislative Sportsmen's Caucus, have found a way to pursue their outdoor passions while much of the world seemingly stood still.
 By participating in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing and recreational shooting, sportsmen and women are setting the example for those looking for safe and responsible recreational opportunities.
 Outdoor recreation is a safe way for Florida families to get some fresh air and exercise while adhering to COVID-19 safety guidelines. Florida is blessed with a unique landscape that allows our residents and visitors to enjoy the woods, waters, fields and trails, with many discovering our state's world- class natural resources for the first time. This resurgence in outdoor recreation represents an invaluable opportunity to introduce Americans to activities like hunting and fishing and the vital role sportsmen and women play in conservation.
 Increased participation in hunting, fishing and recreational shooting has enormous conservation benefits through the American System of Conservation Funding. This \"user pays-public benefits\" approach directs the funds generated from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses and self-imposed excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, archery equipment, fishing tackle and motorboat fuel to many state fish and wildlife management agencies.
 In addition, these activities support local economies which, during these unprecedented times, has become incredibly important. Florida's 3,152,000 hunters and anglers have generated an estimated $5.9 billion economic impact while pursuing their outdoor passions.
 Unfortunately, several states implemented certain actions in response to the virus that hindered or even eliminated the ability to participate in our treasured outdoor traditions. These actions severely limited our outdoor opportunities without any measurable increase in public safety.
 To ensure that such restrictive actions are not used again, it is up to sportsmen and women to model responsible recreation. This can be accomplished by following a few simple guidelines:
 ‒ Plan ahead; purchase licenses and park passes online, if available.
 ‒ Explore outdoor activities close to home.
 ‒ Adhere to best practices for avoiding COVID-19.
 ‒ Follow federal, state and local guidelines.
 ‒ Appropriately dispose of trash as a courtesy to others and to avoid the appearance of overuse.
 ‒ Share your adventures in a respectful way on social media outlets.
 To see how your fellow Floridians are using these challenging times as an opportunity to spend more time outdoors, search for #ResponsibleRecreation on social media.

There’s a global battle taking place every day. It’s a battle of ideas, innovation, investment, productivity and competition for the heart and soul of global consumers of technology.


  It’s no secret China is eager to replace the United States as the global leader of technology. Four of the top 10 emerging tech companies are Chinese.


  Meanwhile, American politicians are so determined to score political points they appear willing to help the communists in China move closer to their goal. The American technology and ecommerce sector drives U.S. growth and invested nearly $20 billion more in the U.S. than any other sector in 2018. Yet, the Justice Department, members of Congress and some state attorneys general are eager to attack companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.
