At first, there were some rumblings in the business world, followed by a social media frenzy, and subsequently the mainstream media picked up on it. But, again, no one knew exactly what was going on. Everyone just obsessed over people walking aggressively through the streets and declaring how great they felt. It’s amusing now to think how many had assumed it was just a marketing campaign of some sort — some suggested, for an energy bar. And not like anyone was getting hurt. In light of what has happened since, it was all fun and games back then.

The move towards deeper European integration is highly desirable. It's a natural development of monetary union. We should bear in mind that, following the approval of the NGEU this summer, euro area countries have taken a big step towards closer fiscal integration. They have also created the legitimate expectation of a common fiscal response when dealing with a common shock in the future. I don't know how long it will take to make even greater progress. It is my hope that, when we look back in 20 years' time, we will look upon 2020 as a turning point on the road towards European integration.

WITH Taoiseach Micheál Martin set to make a formal announcement later on this evening, Level 5 restrictions will begin to lift from next Tuesday, December 1. Restrictions will be eased in three phases – the first phase starting on Tuesday, the second likely to be the week after, and the third phase in a period closer to Christmas.As the official Government announcement is set to take place today, here&rsquo;s everything we know so far...Despite Nphet advice last night to only allow takeaway and delivery from restaurants throughout the Christmas period, Independent.ie reports today that restaurants and gastropubs will open up sometime between December 4 and 11.It is expected there will be stricter rules on how long people can stay in restaurants.Earlier this week, it emerged that pubs will only be allowed to serve food if they have a kitchen and a chef onsite, in a bid to crack down on pubs serving a substantial €9 meal in order to be able to sell mostly alcohol.What about &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs? It is unlikely that pubs only serving alcohol will open before Christmas.From next week, outdoor sports such as golf and tennis are also expected to be permitted.However, bad news is in store for GAA fans who will not be allowed to watch live sporting events under the new Level 3 guidelines.For the first time, the All-Ireland senior football and hurling championship finals are set to be held behind closed doors.Religious services will also be allowed in the period between December 18 and January 3.After compromise with Nphet, the Government has decided to reopen restaurants and gastropubs – and keep stricter rules on household visits.These will be permitted from December 18 until January 3. Nphet advised that six people from no more than three households will be able to gather over the two-week period. However, the Government will today make a final decision on this recommendation.Hairdressers, barbers and gyms will reopen from next Tuesday, with most operating only by Non-essential retail will open from next Tuesday.

The same night, the lower house of Parliament Tuesday evening gave initial approval to a security bill that would restrict the publication of photos or videos of police officers&#39; faces, although it still faces further legislative hurdles. Media unions said it could give police a green light to prevent journalists from doing their work and potentially documenting abuses. The bill sparked multiple protests in Paris and other major cities throughout France, with more protests planned. In response to protests and complaints from free expression advocates, the prime minister&#39;s office said Thursday it would set up an independent commission tasked with proposing a new version of the legislation.

Fifteen years after Ike Diogu was a first-round NBA draft pick, Nigerians are setting records.
 Diogu was the lone Nigerian-American among a group of international players selected back in 2005. This year, a whole starting five and then some could be built from all the picks with Nigerian ties.
 "I saw the wave that was coming, but I was just happy the rest of the world got to see it," said the 37-year-old Diogu, the captain of Nigerian national team.
 The NBA hailed last week's draft as "historic" because for the first time two players from Nigeria were first-rounders, and another six who have at least one Nigerian parent were also picked.
 As the rookies sign their first contracts ahead of the NBA season scheduled to start Dec. 22, now comes the hard part of making the team and getting playing time.

India’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 7.5% in the July-September quarter, which is not as bad as the 8.6% contraction predicted by our central bank’s “nowcast" model, and much less worrisome than the double-digit shrinkage some global analysts had projected. This decline comes on the back of a nearly 24% scrunch-in officially recorded in the first quarter of 2020-21, the period that bore the brunt of India's covid lockdown. With two successive quarters of shrinking output, it's now official that our economy was in a technical recession during the first half of this fiscal year.

Sean O'Brien has revealed that he is eyeing up a career in coaching after he calls time on his playing days. The 33-year-old finished up with Leinster and Ireland at the end of the 2018/19 season, joining London Irish in the Premiership on a three-year deal. O'Brien has recovered from a serious hip injury to resume action on the field, and although he is hoping to play for a few more years yet, he is already thinking about life after rugby.O'Brien has been a regular on the sidelines at Tullow RFC throughout his career, helping out at various age groups, including the senior team. Having caught the coaching bug, O'Brien will soon take the first step towards potentially starting a career in the coaching box after he hangs up his boots.Speaking to The Left Wing, O'Brien says that he would like to seek coaching experience around the world before eventually taking a job in Ireland.&quot;I get a lot out of it, and I really enjoy the coaching factor and the mentoring factor, even the bit I'm doing in the club at the minute,&quot; O'Brien said.&quot;I'm doing the RFU course at the start of January to get my badges over here. That is what I want to do when I finish but we'll see what happens. I would like to start over here somewhere and go to Australia and New Zealand for a stint and maybe even Japan to learn different different cultures and how things are done differently in different areas. Then maybe one day end up back around home somewhere.&quot;At his new club, O'Brien has been reunited with former Ireland head coach Declan Kidney and ex-national team assistant Less Kiss. Kidney is the Director of Rugby at London Irish while Kiss is the head coach, and O'Brien has really enjoyed working with the duo once again.&quot;We have had some good conversations, Deccie knows me long enough that I would come to him straight with something and tell it like it is and he would do the same with me but he'd hum and he'd haw and he'd find a way to get the message out, which is quite funny,&quot; O'Brien said.&quot;He is still the same fella that he was back at the start for me. I'm enjoying the way the coaches are going about things. We are always chatting and seeing how we can get better and drive the whole setup. The boys haven't changed much.&quot;He [Kiss] has been brilliant and he has really invested in the club. He has brought a lot of energy to the place. He was a very good defence coach with us in Ireland and now he has expanded into a head coach role. He has evolved and he is still so enthusiastic.&quot;

Some chose to rebel; others, total isolation. But at the end of the day, many just wanted to feel great.

Fiscal policy throughout the euro area has been expansionary, although more so in some countries than in others. Substantial discretionary stimulus measures have been taken across the board. We should not look at these measures on a country-by-country basis as the spillovers from a forceful synchronised and common fiscal response are large. Moreover, the efficacy of fiscal policy - the so-called fiscal multiplier - increases when interest rates are close to their lower bound. And like in the United States, we have seen a decisive, area-wide response in terms of both fiscal policy and monetary policy.

A year ago, France demanded a postponement in starting the talks, arguing that with Britain preparing to pull out of the EU and other pressing issues, the bloc had too much on its plate.

But that can&#39;t happen for North Macedonia until Bulgaria is on board. Officials from Germany, which currently holds the EU’s rotating EU presidency, said they hoped Bulgaria and North Macedonia will be able to find a compromise and that the membership talks could begin before the end of the year.

I am concerned. There has been some good news, such as the announcement of the possible approval of vaccines by health authorities. In this respect, there is light at the end of the tunnel. But even under the most optimistic scenario, the production, distribution and administration of these vaccines will take time. It may take even longer to reduce the risk and the perception of risk among the population: savings intentions are at a record high, households and businesses are more indebted than one year ago and coronavirus-induced uncertainty has the potential to leave scars even after the economy recovers. In other words, 2021 will still be a 'pandemic year', and we will still have to tread very carefully. We cannot be complacent. We cannot take the risk of adverse interim scenarios and of letting the consequences of the pandemic last longer without introducing additional policy stimulus, otherwise our production capacity will be hollowed out in the process. The recovery would then take even longer and inflation could continue to hover at very low levels.

The disconnect between interest rates Irish borrowers have to pay compared to our German, French or Italian friends continues. The latest figures from the Central Bank (which helpfully posts the rates every month without actually going to the trouble of rapping its charges on the knuckles for engaging in the &lsquo;rip off&rsquo;) shows the average Irish mortgage rate is 2.78pc. This compares badly with the 1.34pc across the EU. It always does.The European Central Bank is lending for free, so how is it we get the bum steer every time?The difference in this example could be as much as €78,000 a year on a 30-year €300,000 loan. So imagine how someone on Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s top variable rate of 4.2pc must feel.Apathetic, if the truth be known, because we are chronically incurious about what we pay on the most expensive loan in our life.It&rsquo;s just as well. Banks complain, not without cause, that the cost of doing business here is much higher. Customers typically don&rsquo;t pay the hefty set-up fees our EU counterparts do, and our penchant for making repossessions incredibly complicated and expensive means everyone coughs up more.

It was evident even in those early days that whenever people who were touched were involved, a lot of red tape was cut through and things moves at a lightning speed. The markets and economies changed dramatically overnight; decisions and laws which were pending for years were resolved in minutes; changes, in general, which would take decades to materialise, now did so in a matter of weeks. A sort of aggression took over most aspects of life in these regions. Some communities which had been down and out for ages, sprang back to life.
