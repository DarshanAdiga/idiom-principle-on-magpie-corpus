Sapp was asked to exit her vehicle and come to the rear of the vehicle so the original officer could explain her citations.
 Sapp’s registration sticker was very worn and tattered looking to be barely two months old, police said. The 2022 sticker was green in color and had a tear on the bottom left corner extending midway up the sticker. The sticker also had fragments of a piece of paper that appeared to be glued to it, along with a possible fingerprint. The top right corner of the stick was missing where it appeared to have been picked away in an attempt to remove it from a license plate. There was also a small fragment of the sticker stuck on the license plate about an inch away from the sticker placement.
 When Sapp was asked why her barely two-month-old sticker was in bad shape, she said, “it had been through a lot, like her.” Sapp was asked if the sticker was stolen and she said it is not. She had paid her taxes and could prove it.
 Sapp did not have any documentation in regard to the vehicle except an old temporary registration for the vehicle.
 On Aug. 12, the officer contacted the Preston County Tax Office and spoke with a clerk who said Sapp had not paid her taxes, and it was not a valid sticker. The officer ran the numbers off the registration sticker, and it came back to a Kingwood resident.
 Sapp was arraigned in front of Magistrate P.L. Grimm and held on $3,000 bail at Tygart Valley Regional Jail.
 REEDSVILLE — A Morgantown man was arrested on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence on Aug. 30 by the sheriff’s department.
 While observing traffic at the Reedsville intersection, a deputy observed a vehicle traveling west on Veterans Memorial Highway. The vehicle continued onto Kingwood Pike at which time the vehicle dropped off the right side of the roadway in a small ditch line. The driver of the vehicle had difficulty maintaining its lane.
 The deputy made a traffic stop, and the deputy approached the driver, identified as Michael Dean Thornton, 22. The deputy asked Thornton how much he had to drink, meaning alcoholic beverages, and he stated, “not too much,” but later allegedly stated he drank four or five beers.
 The deputy asked Thornton to step out of his vehicle to take field sobriety tests. Thornton allegedly showed signs of impairment on all three tests. The deputy also administrated a preliminary breath test that resulted it a 0.237 blood-alcohol content, and a secondary chemical test resulted in 0.169 BAC, the complaint states. The West Virginia legal limit is 0.08.
 Thornton was arraigned in front of Magistrate P.L. Grimm and released on $2,500 bond.
 TERRA ALTA — A Maryland man was arrested on misdemeanor charges of domestic battery on Aug. 29 by the Preston County Sheriff’s Department.
 According to the criminal complaint, the victim and David Jonathan Lawson, 28, of Upper Marlboro, Md., were staying at Alpine Lake in a cabin. Lawson apparently became intoxicated and an argument ensued when Lawson was accused of drinking all of the whiskey.
 The victim locked herself in the bedroom with a minor child. Lawson became angry and began to pound on the door until it left a deep dent. The victim let Lawson in, and he, according to the victim, demanded the minor.
 The victim stated Lawson grabbed the child and pulled him out of the victim’s arms hard enough to break several of her fingernails. Lawson screamed at the victim and backed her into a corner. The victim was able to protect the child until family members were able to get Lawson to step outside.
 Lawson was arraigned in front of Magistrate P.L. Grimm and released on $2,500 bond.
 KINGWOOD — On Aug. 28, West Virginia State Police responded to a shoplifting complaint at the Walmart in Kingwood.
 According to the criminal complaint, troopers were informed the shoplifter fled, taking a right onto W.Va. 7. The trooper was informed the vehicle had been stopped in Reedsville by a town police officer.
 The trooper asked Roberta Nicole Swaney, 42, of Morgantown several times about the shoplifting report that evening. She continued to deny the shoplifting. Then she allegedly informed the trooper that she did shoplift from Walmart.
 Swaney said she was shoplifting in order to get money for the items to purchase controlled substances, the complaint states. She informed the trooper of several locations inside the vehicle where controlled substances and smoking devices were located.
 Swaney was charged with misdemeanor first-offense shoplifting, obstructing, and possession of a controlled substance.
 She was arraigned in front of Magistrate P.L. Grimm and released on $1,500 bond.
 TERRA ALTA — Sheriff’s deputies arrested a Terra Alta woman for shoplifting and obstruction in relation to an Aug. 20 incident at the BFS store, and then again on Sept. 1 for trespassing in Kingwood.
 According to the criminal complaint, BFS reported there was a woman in the store that been drinking a Polar Pop for three to four hours without paying and would not leave.
 Upon arrival, deputies located Crystal Lee Lewis, 39, holding a Polar Pop outside the store. The deputy asked Lewis what was doing at the store and she replied she was waiting for a ride that stood her up.
 The deputy asked Lewis where she was going, and she replied around the corner to Alpine Apartments and requested a ride. The deputy asked Lewis if she paid for her Polar Pop, and she replied she had.
 The deputy dropped Lewis off at the apartment complex and then went to store where the person who called confirmed that Lewis did not pay for the pop valued at $1.79.
 Lewis was arraigned in front of Magistrate Bo Ward and released on $1,500 bond for the Terra Alta incident.
 In the second incident of trespassing, Preston County Sheriff’s Department were called to the Circle K in Kingwood of a woman “not acting right,” later identified as Lewis.
 The employee of Circle K said Lewis had been there for hours, they asked her to leave and not be back on the property.
 Lewis was told the employee in charge wanted her to leave the property. Lewis asked for permission to stay longer. The deputy advised Lewis she need to gather her belongings and leave the property.
 The deputy went into the Circle K to give Lewis time to leave the property. After a period of time, the deputy went back out and found Lewis still sitting on the bench with no shoes.
 She was arraigned in front of Magistrate P.L. Grimm and released $1,500 bond.
 KINGWOOD — On Sept. 1, State Police were made aware of a vehicle on W.Va. 7 driving recklessly.
 A caller said she was following the vehicle traveling east and said the vehicle had traveled across the center line several times and ran off the roadway several times. Additionally the caller said the vehicle travel off the roadway and around a billboard sign.
 The trooper located the vehicle traveling on South Price Street and performed a traffic stop with the vehicle on Brown Avenue. The trooper observed grass and mud in all four wheels on the vehicle.
 The trooper identified the driver as Samantha Shelton Lojewski, 29, of Morgantown. Lojewski allegedly had slurred speech, the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath, and was very drowsy.
 The trooper had Lojewski perform three field sobriety tests, and she showed impairment on all three, police said.
 Lojewski allegedly refused to provide a breath sample on scene. When being placed in handcuffs, Lojewski resisted arrest, troopers said. She later provided a breath sample which she failed, the complaint states.
 After a 20-minute waiting period, Lojewski provided a sufficient breath sample which allegedly registered a result of 0.344 BAC — more than four times the legal limit.
 Lojewski was charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence, reckless driving and obstruction.
 She was arraigned in front of Magistrate Eugene Jenkins and released on $1,500 bond.
 MASONTOWN — On Aug. 30, State Police were dispatched to a Masontown church parking lot in reference to a disturbance.
 The caller informed the trooper a vehicle was parked in the lot, and the caller stopped to check on the vehicle and the driver, later identified as Trisha Marie Layton, 29, of Masontown, appeared to be under the influence of a controlled substance.
 A verbal altercation occurred between Layton and the caller, and Layton drove the vehicle away from the scene.
 While following up, the trooper located the vehicle. He observed the vehicle’s front windshield was broken and the driver’s door was open. The trooper located Layton inside the residence.
 Police said Layton appeared to be excited, disoriented, had a slurred speech, and was speaking very fast. She allegedly admitted to taking Subutex. The trooper said she failed field sobriety tests.
 Layton was charged with misdemeanor first-offense DUI and defective equipment. She was arraigned in front of Magistrate P.L. Grimm and released on $750 bond.

Earlier this summer, the Village Council decided to move forward with surveying 400 people to gather a representative sample of what Pinehurst residents want in a 21st century library.


  The stakes have now been raised on moving toward a village-owned-and operated library. In a new letter with more than 80 signatures from library supporters, staff, and current and former board members, Given Memorial Library and Tufts Archives has offered its entire library collection along with half of its $2 million endowment to get the village started.


  “We urge the Village of Pinehurst to address these issues now, and without delay,” the letter reads. “There is a significant risk that the current library and archives will fail in the not-so-distant future due to lack of sufficient private funding.”


  Those who signed the letter are exhorting the village to commit to taking full fiscal responsibility for library services in Pinehurst, separate from the Tufts Archives.


  “We know that Given/Tufts has written to the village offering half its endowment, and all of its library collection and other library assets, as a gift to the residents of Pinehurst if the village will take fiscal responsibility for library services,” the letter reads.


  “We think that residents should know of this substantial gift. This seems like an important piece of information for Pinehurst residents as they make up their minds about the library. What other village of our size can open a new library with a seven-figure endowment and a gift of more than 15,000 titles? Only in Pinehurst.”


  The letter is published in full on page B2 of today’s edition of The Pilot.


  “Since 1996, off and on, expansion and growth has reared its ugly head. But never before has it been so profoundly necessary,” said Audrey Moriarty, executive director of Given Memorial Library and the Tufts Archives.


  Moriarty, as the organization’s head librarian and archivist, heads a group of four full-time employees and a handful of part-timers between the library, the archives, and the Given Book Shop.


  “Right now, all I hear is what we don’t do and what we don’t do right. There’s not much we can do. We’ve been as innovative as we can.”


  The Given Memorial Library opened in 1964 in memory of John L. and Irene Heinz Given. The Tufts Archives was built in 1973 with an endowment from the Tufts Family Foundation, adding a museum of Pinehurst and golf to the library building. The archive holds a trove of documents and artifacts chronicling Pinehurst’s history, the growth of golf locally and the work of Donald Ross as the nation’s early premier course designers.


  Since Given opened 56 years ago, Pinehurst’s population has grown more than 10 times what it was then, and the library faces far greater demand from families with school-aged children. The village realized in the 1990s that the needs of Pinehurst had outgrown the privately operated library’s capacity, and discussions have periodically surfaced over the last 20 years about the need for a solution.


  The letter notes that and compliments the village for its recent work to advance the subject of a municipal library.


  “This issue has arisen on several occasions since at least the early 1990s,” the letter reads. “But the current mayor, council and staff in just a few months have moved the ball further than any others, and we salute and encourage your progress.”


  At the beginning of the year, the village brought a national library consulting firm on board to assess Pinehurst’s library needs through public input and stakeholder interviews. The ensuing report was presented to the Village Council in April. It suggested a facility more than three times the size of Given Memorial, that could cost between $5 million and $8 million, depending on its features and location. Several potential sites have been identified.


  The Village Council wasn’t entirely satisfied with the methodology behind that report though, though, and commissioned a broader survey of residents.


  Mayor John Strickland said this past week that the survey has been completed, and the Village Council should be reviewing the responses in the next 30 days.


  “We wanted to get some further information very specific to what library services are most important among Pinehurst citizens. That wasn’t clear in the earlier study that we received,” said Strickland.

This is a fun dish for all the pepper lovers out there. I used a variety of peppers from the garden: jalapeños, bell peppers, Anaheims and poblanos. You can use a mixture as I did, or choose your favorite. The addition of the eggs will give an almost soufflelike texture to the casserole.      You'll need 8 to 10 peppers, and based on the size of the peppers, you may want to use a few more or less. The number of peppers to be layered into the casserole is flexible.      CHORIZO AND ROASTED PEPPER CASSEROLE   • 8 to 10 peppers (your choice of heat levels)   • 1 pound Mexican chorizo, casings removed   • 1 large yellow onion, diced   • 4 cloves garlic, minced   • 2 cans Rotel tomatoes   • 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano   • 3 cups shredded Monterey Jack, Mexican blend or Cotija cheese   • 12 eggs   • 1/3 cup self-rising flour   • Pinch of salt   • Chopped cilantro   • Sour cream      First, the peppers will need to be roasted, not only to remove the outer skin, but to also impart a charred flavor to them. Preheat the grill to 400 to 450 degrees F., and carefully place the peppers on the grill. Cover and let roast for a few minutes, turning them frequently with tongs as they begin to char. When the peppers have softened and charred, use tongs to remove them to a plastic bag and seal it tightly, or place the peppers in a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. This will allow the peppers to "sweat," and you can easily remove the charred outer layer. When the peppers have cooled enough to handle, discard the charred pieces and carefully cut the peppers so they will lay flat. Remove the stems, inner membrane and seeds, and discard.      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.      While the peppers are resting, place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Break the chorizo into pieces with a wooden spoon and, frequently stirring, allow to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions and garlic and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well. Add Rotel tomatoes and oregano and reduce heat to low. Stirring occasionally, let the mixture cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.      Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with non-stick spray.      Add one-half of the chorizo mixture to the baking dish. Top with 1 cup of the cheese. Using about half of the peppers, add a layer of the peppers on top of the chorizo mixture.      Repeat the layers using the remainder of the chorizo, 1 cup of cheese and the remaining peppers. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, flour and a pinch of salt together.   Slowly pour the egg mixture over the top of the peppers and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the top starts to brown and the eggs are set, but still soft.      Let rest for 2 to 3 minutes, cut into squares and serve. Top with chopped cilantro and sour cream.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.
 Back in March, the COVID-19 pandemic was just getting unwound in the United States, WVU’s director of athletic content, John Antonik, wrote about how the flu decimated what was supposed to be a great West Virginia team and took tackle John Fuccy from us.
 On Wednesday of this week, the _Wall Street Journal_ revisited that season and how despite the pandemic they played on at many places and how the disease affected us right here at West Virginia and up the road in Pittsburgh.
 We are now a day from what was supposed to be the season opener in 2020 against Florida State, a game that was canceled in a season that has ended for some conference but that will be played in the Big 12, the SEC and the ACC ... a season unlike any other, except maybe that 1918 season.
 The article in the _Pittsburgh Press_ that day in 1918, when the U.S. was involved across the Atlantic in World War I and people across the world was falling from the flu, began like this:
 While West Virginia’s authorities had been struggling along trying to make a show, at least, of football similar to that offered in normal times and making a fair success of it, the events of the past week have practically shattered all hopes of putting out a team that is even a shadow of elevens produced by the Mountaineers in past years.
 It then described the events that had transpired over the prior week.
 The events that have so changed the aspect of things athletic here are the death from influenza here of Joseph Fuccy of Weston, who had practically clinched a place on the line; the appointment of head coach M.M. “Tubby” and ex-captain and All-American center R.B. Bailey to an officers’ training camp, and the announcement that Russell Meredith, star guard last year and a varsity tackle this year, would not re-enter the university when it reopens on Oct. 22 because he had failed of admission on his application for membership in the S.A.T.C. (Student Army Training Corps)
 Fuccy’s death came as shock to the community for the newspaper reporter he was “a picture of health, weighed 190 pounds and promised to become one of the greatest players ever at West Virginia.”
 But there was no justice, just as for those stricken by today’s pandemic there is no justice now.

On teachers’ end, they’re more likely to appreciate individual thermostats to set the temperature in each classroom within a predetermined range. Each classroom will also have its own sink and attached storage closet.


  Moore County Schools’ original schedule for opening its new elementary schools had the Southern Pines campus opening this fall along with the new Aberdeen school. But that timeline allowed for scarcely a month between the end of construction and the opening day for students, leaving no room for delay.


  A year ago, the district moved the school’s projected opening date to the beginning of 2021.


  Birath said that the coronavirus pandemic has effected about two weeks’ worth of delays through supply chain interruptions and quarantined workers. The manufacturer lined up to produce cabinets had to shut down due to the virus, and the team in charge of installing steel roof framing was briefly sidelined.


  “The real impact is when it happens to the major critical items such as structure –– it’s hard to have the next trade come in without that –– and manufacturing plants,” said Birath. “If you lose just a crew, if it was just the installers, they would go get other installers in to put them in. It’s the manufacturing process and the major components that have an impact.”


  Despite that, the school’s construction is projected to wrap up in time for a late October ribbon-cutting.

“A questionnaire was created that was very specific to the types of services that Pinehurst residents want; not what they have today necessarily, but what services they want and what are the most important ones for them.”


  Pinehurst’s leaders have had the plight of the Given Memorial Library and the Tufts Archives in mind all along as they’ve discussed the potential for a municipal library. Strickland said that the library made the offer of its collection and part of its endowment to the village earlier this year.


  “We’re very interested in what they have to offer but we haven’t gotten to that point yet because we need to first assess the results of the survey on specific uses,” he said.


  “Going back three or four years, the council and the library board and village staff entered into a kind of study group to assess the financial implications of the current model that the library and archives have, which is essentially relying on private donors and the endowment. Everybody’s understood that model is not going to be operable for much longer.”


  The library’s normal hours, closing at 5 p.m. on weekdays, leave a limited window of time for parents to bring children after school or work. To make room for new books, old ones have to be sold or sent out on long-term loan. The library has a single publicly available computer — Moriarty says there’s nowhere to put more, even if they were donated — and popular programs are standing room only.


  Within its capacity, Moriarty said that the Given Memorial Library has provided an array of services. One employee is a notary, and several are certified to administer college exams to distance-learning students in the UNC system. They’ve even helped visually impaired patrons set up their personal computing devices.


  “In general, we’re just full to the gills,” said Moriarty. “We do lots of things like that with a very small staff. We can’t do more because everybody’s already very busy and we all do everything.”


  The library announced plans for a $4.6 million expansion in 2012. Pinehursrt pledged $1 million toward the project at the time, but the library was never able to successfully raise the rest of the funds. That pledge has since reverted back to the village and sits in a reserve account.


  Pinehurst has contributed to the Given Memorial Library operations all along. Its current annual pledge of $150,000 accounts for just under 20 percent of the library’s budget.


  Since their establishment, the Given Memorial Library and Tufts Archives have served two largely disparate audiences. Moriarty said that last year the archives had visitors from 44 states and 13 nations.


  “The rest of the world knows more about the Tufts Archives than Pinehurst does,” she said. “Locals come; if they have company the first thing they do is bring them over here. They come and have a little walk-through, so the Tufts Archives are sort of on a lot of people's list of things to show off.


  “But then we have golf course architects, golf aficionados, members of other clubs who come and research. It’s people who are very interested in golf and people who are very interested in the history of Pinehurst.”


  As longtime supporters of the library and archives have passed away, younger residents haven’t always taken their place — especially as many assume that the library must have full public funding behind it.


  That has left the library’s staff in an almost constant fundraising mode and left the organization to withdraw from its endowment at a level that’s not sustainable long-term. Now the coronavirus pandemic has delivered a blow, as it has to many nonprofits, by forcing the cancellation of large social fundraising events.


  Hence the decision to offer half of its endowment and its 15,000 titles to a village-led venture.


  With the staff, building and remaining resources focused on the Tufts Archives alone, the archives could develop into a fully-fledged golf museum with a few minor tweaks to the interior.


  But that can’t be considered until the village takes the lead in providing a library for its residents.


  “I think if one needed to, there are lots of golf entities that would get on board to help. I think the resort would be interested in supporting it,” Moriarty said. “They’ve expressed some potential interest but they’re not going to do anything or make any kind of move, if they do, until the Village of Pinehurst has made a decision.”


  That decision is unlikely to come before the village figures out where a new library might be built or before they’ve explored the full financial ramifications of constructing and operating it.


  “Whether or not the village should take over the provision of library services to residents is the decision the council has to make,” Strickland said. “We haven’t decided we should, we haven’t decided we should not. We’re evaluating all the aspects of what Pinehurst residents want and the implications for the village in the future should we take over the library.”

Virginia law currently gives the health commissioner the authority to issue a mandate for a vaccine in the case of an epidemic. The law allows doctors to exempt people from vaccination if their health would be negatively affected. A. E.

THE FACTS: Bowser did not call for the removal of the Washington Monument or Lincoln Memorial. The monuments are on federal land outside the mayor’s jurisdiction. Social media posts making the claim misrepresented a report released Tuesday by the District of Columbia Facilities and Commemorative Expressions task force. The task force was formed by Bowser over the summer in response to nationwide protests over police brutality. The task force recommended renaming, relocating and adding context to monuments, schools, parks and buildings. The Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial were named in the report. The Lincoln Memorial was not mentioned, as posts suggested. The mayor has not called for the changes or endorsed them, according to a spokesperson in her office. “Mayor Bowser has asked the DC FACES Working Group to clarify and refine their recommendations to focus on local DC, so no one attempts to confuse the Working Group’s focus on contextualizing not removing important monuments and memorials in DC,” LaToya Foster, director of communications for the mayor, said in an email. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that many of the monuments and statues in the nation’s capital are on federal land, which would be outside the local government’s control. The false posts online received hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The posts suggested that the mayor was attempting to erase or rewrite history for the city. Following the backlash, a page reviewing statues and memorials was removed from the report. The White House responded to the task force’s report saying that the president would not allow the recommendations to move forward. “As long as President Trump is in the White House, the mayor’s irresponsible recommendations will go absolutely nowhere, and as the mayor of our Nation’s capital city - a city that belongs to the American people - she ought to be ashamed for even suggesting them for consideration,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement Tuesday. The mayor’s office told the AP that it was interesting that the White House was commenting on “an intragovernmental report about how to recognize all sides of our history.”

  This is a fun dish for all the pepper lovers out there. I used a variety of peppers from the garden: jalapeños, bell peppers, Anaheims and poblanos. You can use a mixture as I did, or choose your favorite. The addition of the eggs will give an almost soufflelike texture to the casserole.


  You'll need 8 to 10 peppers, and based on the size of the peppers, you may want to use a few more or less. The number of peppers to be layered into the casserole is flexible.


  CHORIZO AND ROASTED PEPPER CASSEROLE   • 8 to 10 peppers (your choice of heat levels)   • 1 pound Mexican chorizo, casings removed   • 1 large yellow onion, diced   • 4 cloves garlic, minced   • 2 cans Rotel tomatoes   • 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano   • 3 cups shredded Monterey Jack, Mexican blend or Cotija cheese   • 12 eggs   • 1/3 cup self-rising flour   • Pinch of salt   • Chopped cilantro   • Sour cream


  First, the peppers will need to be roasted, not only to remove the outer skin, but to also impart a charred flavor to them. Preheat the grill to 400 to 450 degrees F., and carefully place the peppers on the grill. Cover and let roast for a few minutes, turning them frequently with tongs as they begin to char. When the peppers have softened and charred, use tongs to remove them to a plastic bag and seal it tightly, or place the peppers in a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. This will allow the peppers to \"sweat,\" and you can easily remove the charred outer layer. When the peppers have cooled enough to handle, discard the charred pieces and carefully cut the peppers so they will lay flat. Remove the stems, inner membrane and seeds, and discard.


  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.


  While the peppers are resting, place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Break the chorizo into pieces with a wooden spoon and, frequently stirring, allow to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions and garlic and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well. Add Rotel tomatoes and oregano and reduce heat to low. Stirring occasionally, let the mixture cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.


  Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with non-stick spray.


  Add one-half of the chorizo mixture to the baking dish. Top with 1 cup of the cheese. Using about half of the peppers, add a layer of the peppers on top of the chorizo mixture.


  Repeat the layers using the remainder of the chorizo, 1 cup of cheese and the remaining peppers. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, flour and a pinch of salt together.   Slowly pour the egg mixture over the top of the peppers and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the top starts to brown and the eggs are set, but still soft.


  Let rest for 2 to 3 minutes, cut into squares and serve. Top with chopped cilantro and sour cream.

Burton boss Jake Buxton was delighted as his managerial debut resulted in a 4-2 penalty shoot-out victory over fellow League One side Accrington after a 1-1 draw in normal time.


  Lucas Akins, as he has done four times in his seven seasons at the club, netted on the opening day to get the Buxton era off to a good start with a fine curled finish but it was goalkeeper Ben Garratt who took the headlines, saving Accrington’s first two penalties from Joe Pritchard and Matt Butcher after Cameron Burgess’ late leveller took the first round tie to spot kicks.


  “I am over the moon with the performance” Buxton said. “We asked the players to run around and get stuck in and to work hard for each other and they did that from minute one right until the end.


  “Whenever it is only one-nil and you don’t take your chances, which we had quite a few of, although not clear cut, you have to finish teams off. Any opposition can put a ball in your box and pick up a second ball and score but our heads didn’t drop and we stuck at it”


  Buxton also recognised the contribution of keeper Garratt who ultimately saw his side home in to round two.


  “Ben’s attitude from day one of pre-season has been tremendous and he has took on board the work we are trying to do with the new regime. He is old enough to realise the hard work that is required. He was tremendous with his feet tonight and his hard work in training paid off with the penalty saves.” Buxton said.


  Accrington boss John Coleman was left to rue the lottery of a penalty shoot- out as he watched his side miss early on to allow the Brewers to capitalise.

England captain Eoin Morgan talked up the leadership of Chris Jordan and Tom Curran after they helped produce an excellent fightback to beat Australia in the first of three Twenty20 internationals at the Ageas Bowl.


  After setting 163 for victory, following a crucial 66 from Dawid Malan, the hosts were on the ropes with Aaron Finch and David Warner putting on 98 for the first wicket.


  Jofra Archer made the breakthrough with Finch out four short of his fifty and he also saw off Warner for 58.


  England were still outsiders at this stage with 34 needed off 28 balls and six wickets in hand, but Jordan conceded just four from the penultimate over to leave 15 needed off Curran’s last six balls and they went for just 12 to secure victory by two runs.


  “It is the best case scenario and the best practise,” Morgan said.


  “Everybody stood up. In the winter it was very similar in New Zealand and South Africa where Chris Jordan and Tom Curran led the attack and took the responsibility.

Sometime in 2017 I was at work and trying to decipher a message sent to the Nantucket (MA) Fire Department Facebook page. Our messages are typically requests for patches or T-shirts, but this one was different. This message was sent by Diane Cotter and it referenced a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) that was, according to Diane, contaminating our turnout gear. On her Web site, yourturnoutgearandpfoa.com, Diane was posting information and trying to raise awareness of the PFOA issue. Our department made some inquiries and, luckily, we were relieved to learn that our current gear was in fact safe. According to the textile and personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturers, they had “not used that chemical in years.” We continued doing business as usual. Our turnout gear hung all along the wall of the apparatus floor, we threw it in our vehicles when we had to, and we wore it into the schools for fire and life safety education, crawling low on the floors and giving high fives to the kids.

British interest in the singles at the US Open ended disappointingly early with defeats for Dan Evans and Cameron Norrie.


  Four British men reached the second round in New York for the first time in nearly 50 years, with Johanna Konta also winning her opening match, but fortunes have nosedived since.


  Only Norrie reached the third round, for the first time in his career at a grand slam, but he was unable to take advantage of a very good chance to go further, losing 7-6 (2) 4-6 6-2 6-1 to Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.


  Evans followed his countryman onto Court Five for the conclusion of his second-round clash against another 21-year-old, France’s Corentin Moutet, after rain intervened on Thursday evening.


  They resumed at one-set all and Evans won the first point to take the third set to a tie-break.


  He led 4-1 in that but lost six of the next seven points and then let slip a 3-0 lead in the fourth set as 77th-ranked Moutet triumphed 4-6 6-3 7-6 (5) 7-6 (1).
