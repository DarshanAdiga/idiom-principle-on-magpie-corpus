Steven Bergwijn's response has been particularly impressive. He won back possession against Arsenal five times -- only Serge Aurier (11) and Pierre- Emile Hojbjerg (8) did it more -- and has shown a willingness to apply himself to the defensive side of the game Mourinho deems so important. Mourinho freely admitted that Bergwijn "wasn't my first option" after Spurs paid PSV Eindhoven £26m to sign the winger last January, but he started all three games against City, Chelsea and Arsenal to underline how much he has changed his manager's mind.
 Much has been made of Tottenham's conservative approach in climbing to the top of the table. Mourinho's requirement that his players remain disciplined and dogged out of possession, tracking back to close down space for opponents at all times, does not necessarily play to Bale's strengths. The prodigal son may have returned, but he must muck in with the rest.
 Ultimately, Bale's quality in the final third will surely be a vital component in the challenges ahead. Spurs have been clinical at the top end of the pitch, remarkably so in fact, with Kane and Son both exceeding their expected numbers by some distance: Kane's expected assists in the League stands at 4.31. He has 10. Son's xG is 3.9. He has scored 10, the same number incidentally as Arsenal have managed all season. The importance placed on expected goal and assist statistics is debatable, but it does provide an indication that the pair are performing at a level of efficiency that is probably unsustainable over a 38-game campaign, especially one this condensed. And those will be the moments where others must step in.
 Bale has had time to get ready. His moment may soon come.

Yet not all supporters have as much faith. They will never turn on the 47-year-old en masse after what he achieved as a player, but there are concerns about his CV. Three of United's Premier League rivals in the northwest of England are all managed by coaches who have won the Champions League -- Guardiola at City, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool and Carlo Ancelotti at Everton. Then there is Mourinho at Tottenham, and looking past Mikel Arteta's difficult start to this season at Arsenal, he has already won the FA Cup after less than a year in charge. Solskjaer, meanwhile, has two Norwegian titles with Molde and been relegated from the Premier League with Cardiff.
 Other supporters insist Solskjaer has been let down by the Glazers, Woodward and other figures in senior management. After finishing third last season and reaching three cup semifinals, Solskjaer wanted four top players to turn United into serious contenders for the Premier League and the Champions League. He got just one -- Donny van de Beek \-- plus two teenage wingers and 33-year-old free agent Edinson Cavani.
 There is plenty of admiration among United's fan base for Mauricio Pochettino, still unemployed after leaving Tottenham a year ago, but there is skepticism about whether the Argentine would get the players to challenge Guardiola and Klopp. Mourinho has not said much about his time at Old Trafford, but did say this: "One, time has spoken. Two, the problems are still there." In other words, not every issue can be solved by simply sacking the manager.
 Coronavirus restrictions are set to be relaxed in Manchester on Dec. 16, and Saturday's Manchester derby could be the last game at Old Trafford played behind closed doors. Given United's ability to thrill and flop at any time, it's difficult to know what the mood will be like when supporters return against Leeds on Dec. 20 or whether, after losing in Leipzig, the derby performance will be defiant or disastrous.
 There is only one certainty. It will take more than a bad week to leave Solskjaer on the "brink."

There is a clear need for practical policy recommendations for African governments already using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and those planning to do so in the future. Given that this is a new area for most of them, it would also be worthwhile for these governments to share lessons learned and best practices with each other. This would include closely cooperating with established nuclear actors in the North and South, as well as continental and regional organisations, such as AFCONE and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Such cooperation would assist aspiring nuclear powers in establishing credible, robust nuclear non-proliferation regimes which are essential for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy.

 Join us in Egypt where the pandemic has prompted Bedouin communities to return to small-scale farming. After income from tourism dried up, many are going back to a traditional way of life.
 In Germany, abandoned mines are coming back to life thanks to a biologist replanting the devastated landscapes and returning many rare species to where they once thrived.
 And finally, meet Africa's Erin Brockovich! When Kenyan activist Phyllis Omido realized big industrial plants in her neighborhood were poisoning people, she took action. This year she was finally vindicated when a court granted the community millions in compensation.
