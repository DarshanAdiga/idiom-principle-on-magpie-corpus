"My number I'm rocking? I'm going with that two-four, man. I'm rockin' with two-four this year," Slay said on Saturday. "Kobe mode. Black mamba, baby. Rest in peace to the GOAT, man. Rest in peace to one of my favorite players. ... I think I'm gonna look good in 24."


  Slay has a reputation among his fellow NFL players as a massive Bryant fan. This was reinforced following his announcement on Instagram Live. Several cornerbacks, including his former teammate Nevin Lawson - now with the Raiders - and former Houston Texans standout Charles James, weighed in to praise Slay's decision.


  No. 24 was worn by running back Jordan Howard during the 2019 season after he was traded to the Eagles by the Chicago Bears. The veteran is now in Miami after signing a two-year deal worth $9.75 million, making his jersey available for Slay.


  A three-time Pro Bowl selection with 19 interceptions to his name, Slay was reportedly unhappy in Detroit. The Eagles traded two draft picks to acquire his services as a No. 1 cornerback. The team also signed him to a three-year, $50 million contract extension, per ESPN. Slay is now the NFL's highest-paid cornerback, averaging $16.67 million annually.

  Now armed with a new contract and a new number, Slay will be searching for even more success in Philadelphia. He will also be honoring Bryant every time that he puts his new jersey on over his shoulder pads.

Paul is the first U.S. senator known to test positive for COVID-19, according to a report by NBC News, but not all lawmakers have been tested. Two congressmen have also tested positive -- Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah. On Saturday, Diaz-Balart told NBC News that the illness hit him "like a ton of bricks."


  Paul is now expected to miss a vote in the Senate on Sunday afternoon, meant to either pass or deny a massive coronavirus relief package. Senate Republicans are asking for the final vote on Monday.


  Just last week, Paul came under fire for slowing the process of voting on that coronavirus package. The senator was pushing hard for an amendment to the package, which would "require a social security number for purposes of the child tax credit, and to provide the President the authority to transfer funds as necessary, and to terminate United States military operations and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan," according to a report by NBC News.

  As it is, the package would provide free coronavirus testing, secure paid emergency leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, increased Medicaid funding and stronger food security initiatives for Americans.

When he was developing the learning page, he began by inviting as many parents as possible. He said he didn’t want his students to just review materials by means of pencil and paper.


  “I wanted them to have the best education that we could give them,” he said.


  Attendance for the livestreams has been good, as well. Fitzwater goes live at 11 a.m. with about three to five families watching. Because many of his classroom’s parents work, some students might not be able to watch the live feed, but the videos are still available after the livestream ends.


  “The great part about the livestreams is the fact that when the parents get home from work, they can have their kids watch it on our archived videos,” he said, which means the learning process doesn’t stop for those children either.


  While the goal in the beginning was to ensure his students could continue learning, Fitzwater said more Leading Creek families and those from other local schools are now accessing the page, partly because he created some tutorials on how to access certain educational websites and activities. When he plans for livestreams, he always covers reading, phonics, mathematics and writing. He also tries to keep lessons as close to how he teaches in his classroom as possible, with modifications when needed.


  “It’s really odd to ask a question and not have 15 6-year-olds shouting out the answer. I still make a type of lesson plans, but have to modify them to fit the tight schedule,” he said.


  Though the traditional learning process is different, students still have work to complete. Homework assignments are given at the end of the videos to be turned in the next day. How is this accomplished? Fitzwater said many parents send photos of completed work through the learning page. Kindergartners do not receive letter grades but work is rated on scale of Mastery, Partial Mastery, and Novice for a specific skill, he said.


  With a return to school date tentatively up in the air, Fitzwater said he plans to conduct the virtual classroom until school would normally conclude. He wants his students to be prepared for first grade in the fall and believes that using live feeds and Skype can help him make that a reality.


  “My kids deserve the best education that I can give them, and if we can’t meet in person, then they can visit me online every day.”

As of Sunday, 970 people have been tested, 961 of whom do not have the virus. Mobile testing units are up and running in all four regional health zones.


  "We are at the beginning of this in Newfoundland and Labrador, and while to some, nine may not seem like a lot, how we behave now will determine how COVID-19 will progress," said Fitzgerald.


  She said it's difficult to estimate when case numbers will peak in the province, but she wouldn't be surprised to see double-digits in the near future.


  Health Minister John Haggie said the province is investigating the possibility of bringing recently retired respiratory therapists and other personnel back into the fold to operate ventilators, if it comes to that.

Their message concluded with a simple, yet sweet, "Thank you" along with a red heart emoji.


  Harry and Markle's statement touches upon the fact that this is a difficult time for those around the world amidst the coronavirus crisis. Days before their Mother's Day post, the couple addressed this health crisis on their Instagram with a lengthy, powerful message about the pandemic.


  "These are uncertain times. And now, more than ever, we need each other. We need each other for truth, for support, and to feel less alone during a time that can honestly feel quite scary," their statement began. "There are so many around the world who need support right now, who are working tirelessly to respond to this crisis behind the scenes, on the frontline, or at home. Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID-19 is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit."
