Oaklander Jasmine Guillory is a romance author by trade, and we're so lucky that she deigns to write about food once in a while. This piece in Bon Appetit about her grandmother's cornbread dressing is a dream. "Full of cornbread and spicy sausage, it engages all of the senses. Like everything born in New Orleans, it starts with onions and garlic and green bell peppers and celery, and as it cooks you can smell those flavors all coming together with the cayenne and the meat. When you take it out of the oven, it bubbles and crackles, its top a bronze crust, its inside deep yellow."

Congratulations to my friend, Justin. He won his fantasy game this week because Todd Gurley _didn’t_ stop at the 1-yard line and cost the Falcons the win. That touchdown gave him the points he needed to get over the top. Also, still, lol Falcons.

He also alleged that 60 scams to the tune of about Rs 30,000 crore have taken place in the state under the leadership of Nitish Kumar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "Inflation is the biggest issue. BJP people used to wear a garland of onions. Now it is about to touch Rs 100/kg. Those who were speaking about onion when it touched Rs 50-60/kg are now silent when it has crossed Rs 80/kg. Starvation and poverty are rising in the state," Yadav said while speaking to media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "There is unemployment, small traders are destroyed. GDP is falling, we are going through an economic crisis. Farmers are being destroyed, youth is unemployed, Bihar is poor and people are migrating for education, jobs and medical help," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   After promising 10 lakh jobs in the state for the youth, Tejashwi has brought rising inflation as a key issue in the ongoing Bihar election campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Mahagathbandhan's Chief Ministerial face, Tejashwi Yadav alleged that misappropriation to the tune of about Rs 30,000 crore has been done in 60 scams under Nitish Kumar's leadership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "There is no audit of money in times of calamity. Corruption has increased considerably, no work can be done without a bribe. Nitishji has made a tradition that not a single work can be done in Bihar without offering a bribe," he alleged.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A center-right coalition in Lithuania, led by the conservative Homeland Union, is headed back to power after eight years in the opposition after winning the most votes in a weekend parliamentary runoff. Key challenges looming for the new three-party coalition will be tackling a budget deficit, a growing health crisis and high unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Lithuania, a nation of 2.8 million, has seen its economy hit hard by the pandemic. Unemployment rose from 9% in February to over 14% in September. The outgoing parliament drafted a 2021 budget with a 4-billion euro ($4.7 billion) deficit. “These were rather typical European elections as disappointed voters turned to the opposition in hopes of more effective management and better results,” said Mazvydas Jastramskis, a political analyst at Vilnius University. On Monday, party leaders agreed to form a center-right coalition that will have a majority in the 141-seat parliament, the Seimas. Former presidential candidate Ingrida Simonyte of the Homeland Union is likely to become the Baltic country's next prime minister, the three parties said in a joint statement. After two rounds of voting, the Homeland Union party had won 50 seats, and its partners, the Liberal Movement and a political newcomer, the Freedom Party, got 13 and 11 seats each, respectively. Together they secured a majority with 74 seats, clearing the minimum of 71 seats to be able to form a government. The outgoing senior ruling party, the Farmers and Greens, won only 32 seats while their supporters — the Social Democrats and the populist Labour party — got 13 and 10 seats respectively. In Sunday’s elections, 68 seats were up for grabs while the remaining seats had been allotted after the first...

I’m not sure what is bothering me more: The idea of missing the life I had before the coronavirus pandemic or the fear that what life has evolved into is going to last a long time, and perhaps just be the way it is from now on.
 It’s not my intent to whine or complain, but like many out there, I’m reaching a breaking point in this whole pandemic-driven world. It’s really getting to me, and I’m not quite sure how to handle it.
 The trick is to understand and realize it is OK to feel that way. To know it is perfectly normal (to use a word that has lost much of its meaning in 2020) to be affected by what’s going on. That’s something we all must come to grips with individually.

Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail on Monday hinted at challenging an arbitration order that put a temporary hold on its ₹24,713 crore deal to sell assets to Reliance Industries.


  Future Retail said it wasn’t party to the agreement under which Amazon.com Inc had invoked arbitration proceedings.


  Amazon, which acquired an indirect minority stake in the retail and fashion conglomerate last year, alleged that Future’s sale of its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to Reliance breached its pre-existing contract, which included a right of the first offer and a non-compete clause.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan said Monday it will not sign a U.N. treaty that bans nuclear weapons and does not welcome its entry into force next year, rejecting the wishes of atomic bomb survivors in Japan who are urging the government to join and work for a nuclear-free world. The United Nations confirmed Saturday that 50 countries have ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, paving the way for its entry into force in 90 days. The announcement was hailed by anti-nuclear activists, but the treaty has been strongly opposed by the United States and other major nuclear powers. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan shares the goal of achieving a nuclear-free world, but does not think the treaty is the way to go. “Japan's approach is different from that of the treaty, and there is no change to our position not to sign it, as we have said,” Kato told reporters Monday. “We doubt if support is growing even among non-nuclear weapons states, let alone nuclear weapons states.\" Japan has said that it is not realistic to pursue the treaty with nuclear powers and non-nuclear weapons states sharply divided over it. Kato said Japan has chosen instead to serve as a bridge to narrow the gap between the two sides. Asked if Japan at least welcomes the treaty taking effect next year, Kato only repeated Japan's position. Japan has decided not to sign the treaty even though it is the world’s only country to have suffered nuclear attacks and has renounced its own possession, production or hosting of nuclear weapons. That is because Japan hosts 50,000 American troops and is protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Its post-World War II security pact with the U.S. also complicates efforts to get Japan to sign the treaty as it beefs up its own military to deal...

There's a way for [Bush] to split the difference between Obama's perceived lack of interest in European security and his brother's Iraq aggression and to look at least competent when it comes to these affairs."

In my case, I’ve reached the conclusion it’s fine not to shine right now. To survive rather than thrive is OK too, for a time. I admire and salute all those who have managed a month with no booze. But I’ve stopped feeling guilty about pouring myself a drink at the end of the day. For me, it’s just not the right time. Maybe I’ll have a crack at Dry January. I said maybe.

Stokes and Sanju Samson put together an unbeaten partnership of 152 runs. With this win, Rajasthan Royals has now moved to sixth place in the points table with 10 points while Mumbai Indians are still in the top spot with 14 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tendulkar said the century from Stokes made the chase very comfortable. The legendary batsman also praised Sanju Samson for an equally important knock against Mumbai Indians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "Big Player, Big Impact! Brilliant 100 by @benstokes38 to make this chase look very comfortable. @IamSanjuSamson played an equally important innings and he was a perfect partner for Stokes,"  Tendulkar tweeted.

Eva Maggard, 70, used to walk most days from her home on Eddy Street to Union Square, where she would sit and watch the tourists get on the double-decker buses or swarm around the plaza. Several times a week she'd go to Curry Senior Center for classes or just to hang out with the staff.

If you are from the right and suggest the same thing, you must eat your words and apologise as Lady Jenkins, a Tory peer found to her cost after claiming that poor people can’t cook. So where does this myth of Britain being in the middle of a new Ethiopian famine come from? The Guardian alleges that 700,000 children go to school hungry and that more than eight million people in Britain have difficulty putting food on the table. While fat has long been a class issue it is now a racial issue because of Covid.

Joe Biden tells 60 Minutes it's Trump who's 'round the bend' not him, says the Hunter scandal was caused by the Russians feeding Giuliani disinformation and laughs off concerns about his mental capacity

Commenting on the toolkit, Clare Cashman said: “The past number of months has cemented the FRCs role as important messengers for public health advice and guidelines in light of Covid-19.  The digital toolkit we are providing is a helpful resource for all 121 FRCs around the country to enable them to communicate this important information using social media locally to try and keep our communities safe during these difficult times.”

At the time, the preference shares were trading above their par value and so the statement caused concern that holders would incur losses on cancellation. At the close of market on that day the market price for Aviva's preference shares fell between 20% and 26% as holders took action to sell at the above par market price. Retail investors made up a significant proportion of the preference shareholders affected.

Devon point-to-point meeting to take place behind closed doors when new season gets underway next month

Perhaps they’d have to set up a lottery. Any country that took him would be vulnerable to Trump competing with their local leader. He could be taken in by North Korea, perhaps? But the U.S. government, FBI, CIA, etc., wouldn’t let him leave. They’d be afraid he sell state secrets to the highest bidders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            No, that column will have to wait. It was bumped aside when “The Postcard” showed up in my mail last week. It looked innocent enough, marked with a “Vote Yes on 3.” I was done with writing about the new college campus — oops, I mean elementary school — on the fast track to a tax override, faster than even Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination was rammed through the Senate. Especially (boo!) after some moron trashed the Yes On 3 banner at the rotary two weeks go. No way to conduct democracy and turns people off to your side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            No, my reaction to the postcard was spurred by the tiny print in the lower right corner of the card: “Presorted Standard Mail - U.S. Postage Paid - Livingston, MT - Permit #2.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Huh? Livingston, Montana, concerning our $70 million elementary school replacement — telling us that our kids deserve better — (“our kids?”) than these small neighborhood schools that need repairs. Wait, I thought residents loved our smaller, local schools — intimate and closely connected with their teachers in familiar, non-threatening space. That was the big reason stated years go as to why we trashed Fuller School by performing zero maintenance on it for a decade. Too big a space for the kiddos. Small is beautiful, believe us. And it was mostly leaders who are still on the committee saying the opposite today.

It's no secret Trump is reviled across Western Europe, with many people aghast at his style and policies that they say often veer into racism and sexism. In the U.K., a mere 19 percent say that they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs, according to a Pew poll released in September.

Renewed fighting in Eastern Ukraine marked an end to a tenuous cease-fire agreed to in February. NPR's Corey Flintoff explains that international observers fear that a surge in violence could plunge the region into another full scale war.

That brings us to this past weekend. The BayStars were eliminated from pennant contention in the Central League on Friday. On Saturday, Ramirez announced his intention to resign after the season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Taking full responsibility," Ramirez said during a news conference Saturday. "The team put a great team in front of me. I (make) all my decisions based on numbers, and based on feeling. So, I'm leaving today with no regrets."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  With Ramirez moving on, the BayStars will forge ahead in win-now mode without the manager who has won more than anyone else there in over 20 years.

His experience at _ni-gun_ also gives him an intimate knowledge of what the organization has in the pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There is, of course, a chance the BayStars are victims of their own ambitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Maybe Miura sweeps in and wins a pennant or a Japan Series in the next few seasons. Or maybe the club is parting ways with a manager who had a down season in a year disrupted by a pandemic and with a team that's been hit by injuries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It's also worth noting DeNA is two games out of third place, which in a normal year would have the club in the postseason hunt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  No Yokohama manager has actually won the pennant since Hiroshi Gondo's "Machine Gun" offense in 1998 — Miura pitched for that team and was 12-7 with a 3.18 ERA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The closest anyone has come since then was when Ramirez engineered a second-place finish last season.

Royal Challengers Bangalore pacer Navdeep Saini is a doubtful starter for their next IPL match against Mumbai Indians after sustaining a split webbing in his right hand during the game against Chennai Super Kings here.


  It must be noted that Saini, who could be a part of India’s touring team to Australia, will also need the permission of BCCI’s medical team, which is a keeping a tab on all the international players.


  In the 18th over, Saini was hit on the right thumb while fielding off his own bowling. He immediately left the field and got his webbing stitched up by a surgeon.


  “Saini has split his webbing in the last ball there,” RCB team physio Evan Speechly told RCB TV after the match.


  “He obviously got hit on the right thumb. Fortunately, we had a good hand surgeon, who stitched up nicely, put five stitches.


  “So we will monitor him overnight and check whether he can ready for next match. I cannot be sure when he is good to go but hoping he will play next match.”


  Speechly said he cannot say with certainty if Saini will be able to play against MI as the injury is on his bowling hand.


  “It’s also because Saini’s injury is on his bowling hand, so it puts a lot of pressure on him.


  “I cannot be sure when he will be good to go. I am hoping that he will be good to play in the next game and the rest of the tournament,” he said.


  ## Kohli’s experience


  Speechly said the injury is similar to what RCB skipper Virat Kohli suffered in the 2016 season.


  “Virat four-five years ago had it in Kolkata. We managed to stop the bleeding and he smashed a 100 (113, against the Kings XI Punjab) after we got a plastic surgeon, who had stitched it. Unfortunately, you cannot compare the two injuries,” he said.


  “Some people manage it and some can’t.”


  Kohli had finished that season with 973 runs despite having nine stiches on his right hand.


  Saini has been a key bowler for RCB, having taken five wickets conceding just 7.95 runs an over.


  RCB, who finished runners-up in 2016, are currently placed in the third spot in IPL standing with 14 points, behind Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals.


  Kohli’s men will play Mumbai, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals in their remaining league matches.

In case you had any doubt that the coronavirus is back with a vengeance, the US just hit its highest seven-day case average since the pandemic began. More than 225,000 Americans have died from the virus. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows outright said yesterday, "We are not going to control the pandemic." Instead, he said the administration would focus on vaccines and treatments. Dr. Anthony Fauci said we may not get findings on the safety of potential vaccines until December, and widespread availability probably won't come until next year. Meanwhile, at least five of Vice President Mike Pence's aides have tested positive for Covid-19, including his chief of staff Marc Short.

Lamborghini is currently a subsidiary of Audi, but _Reuters_ reported in early October that it could be made public via a spinoff—similar to what Fiat Chrysler Automobiles did with Ferrari in 2015. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, _Reuters_ reported that VW Group is looking to make Lamborghini more independent within the group, in terms of parts sharing and access to suppliers, in order to make an initial public offering possible down the road. Talk of a Lamborghini spinoff dates back to 2019, before the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic hit.

An OTA update is already reaching the Galaxy Note20 Ultra, Note20, Note10+, and the Note10 in the US. Only their unlocked models are currently receiving the build, but given Samsung's performance in the last couple of months, you can expect the carrier variants and other Galaxy phones to follow suit pretty soon. With the limited information available right now, we can't really say what else these updates are bringing to the table, apart from the new patches.

Standards at donation centers vary greatly, with the community’s average income often determining the facility’s overall aesthetic appeal – the lower the average income, the fewer bells and whistles. Facilities in the most impoverished areas often lack even proper seating or sometimes offer no seating at all, forcing donors to squat or crouch on the floor while they donate. Calls have been made for more state or federal regulations to force centers to offer a comfortable, equitable donating experience for everyone in every neighborhood.

  “Saini has split his webbing in the last ball there,” RCB team physio Evan Speechly told RCB TV after the match.


  “He obviously got hit on the right thumb. Fortunately, we had a good hand surgeon, who stitched up nicely, put five stitches.


  “So we will monitor him overnight and check whether he can ready for next match. I cannot be sure when he is good to go but hoping he will play next match.”


  Speechly said he cannot say with certainty if Saini will be able to play against MI as the injury is on his bowling hand.


  “It’s also because Saini’s injury is on his bowling hand, so it puts a lot of pressure on him.


  “I cannot be sure when he will be good to go. I am hoping that he will be good to play in the next game and the rest of the tournament,” he said.


  ## Kohli’s experience


  Speechly said the injury is similar to what RCB skipper Virat Kohli suffered in the 2016 season.


  “Virat four-five years ago had it in Kolkata. We managed to stop the bleeding and he smashed a 100 (113, against the Kings XI Punjab) after we got a plastic surgeon, who had stitched it. Unfortunately, you cannot compare the two injuries,” he said.


  “Some people manage it and some can’t.”


  Kohli had finished that season with 973 runs despite having nine stiches on his right hand.


  Saini has been a key bowler for RCB, having taken five wickets conceding just 7.95 runs an over.


  RCB, who finished runners-up in 2016, are currently placed in the third spot in IPL standing with 14 points, behind Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals.


  Kohli’s men will play Mumbai, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals in their remaining league matches.

 "Honey, this ain't no filter, this is me, my authentic self, I have just been looking after myself a lot recently, and loving myself, and I'm a queen at the end of the day.
 "Yes, my face has changed a little bit but for the better because I've lost weight, I'm feeling good, I've got time to look after myself, I've been having lots of wonderful treatments done at the London Aesthetics Company and I feel brand new."

The appeal for CCEP boss Damian Gammell is exposure to Australia and New Zealand, which offer better growth prospects than Europe. Amatil also bottles a broader range of beverages. Diversifying into coffee and alcohol makes sense when consumers and governments are increasingly suspicious of sugary drinks. By the same token, however, empire-building in mature markets looks more questionable.

"I see a _Pok emon_ card and it was past my generation. I see the investment potential, but the people that get it, the people that will drive the market for it are the people that first see it and there's a sense of nostalgia," Woolf said. "It takes them back to a time when they were younger or puts them in a happy place.

Youri Tielemans hailed Leicester’s first win at Arsenal in almost half a century as a “very important” result on the back of two Premier League defeats. The Foxes secured a 1-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium as Jamie Vardy came off the bench to once again prove the scourge of Arsenal.Vardy, 33, has now hit 11 Premier League goals against the Gunners with only former Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney able to boast more.Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers revealed after the game that his plan was to keep Arsenal at bay before introducing Vardy, who had missed the previous two matches with a calf injury, into the fray.The tactic worked to perfection as Vardy headed home the only goal of the game with 10 minutes remaining to give Leicester a first away win at Arsenal in 47 years and take them into the top four despite recent defeats to West Ham and Aston Villa.&ldquo;We are absolutely buzzing from that win,&rdquo; Tielemans told LCFC TV.&ldquo;I think it was a very important one.&ldquo;We came from two back-to-back defeats in the Premier League, so it was really important to have a result.&ldquo;We knew that we had to be patient, especially in that first half, with them being on the ball and trying to break through our lines and in behind.&ldquo;We had to keep our lines narrow and really tight and try to break on the counter and that&rsquo;s what we did. That&rsquo;s where the goal came from and we are really happy with the result.&rdquo;Tielemans started the breakaway move which resulted in Vardy&rsquo;s goal as his ball over the top of the Arsenal defence set Cengiz Under in behind with the Turkey international then providing the all-important cross. &ldquo;It is really good for us,&rdquo; Tielemans replied when asked about having Vardy back fit.&ldquo;We were a bit unsure if he was going to play or not, but in the end, he played, he came on.&ldquo;He did great, he worked for the team really hard and then he was in a good place at a good moment, so he scored that goal and we won 1-0.&ldquo;We kept a clean sheet at the back, which is really important for the future, and now we have to move on and go again.&rdquo;Arsenal endured a largely frustrating evening as they were unable to get in behind the Leicester defence on a regular basis.Alexandre Lacazette had an early header controversially ruled out for offside against team-mate Granit Xhaka before missing a fine close-range chance later in the first half. Hector Bellerin – who was arguably lucky to be on the pitch after a robust challenge on James Justin could have seen the full-back pick up a second booking – came closest to beating KasperSchmeichel but was denied by the Denmark goalkeeper.The hosts also lost David Luiz to a thigh injury, the extent of which will be assessed in the coming days, as manager Mikel Arteta rued a missed opportunity for his side to push on up the table.&ldquo;I think we created enough chances in the first half to be in front,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;They had 10 men behind the ball and then one occasion, when the ball is under no pressure, we tried to step in and that created the space and then they are through.&ldquo;After the 1-0, I think we have to play those moments better, there were too many free-kicks and we didn&rsquo;t put the ball in the box enough.&ldquo;You start to force some passes that you shouldn&rsquo;t do against these blocks but still they didn&rsquo;t have any threat.&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have any shots on target or anything but they were waiting for one moment and credit to them, they&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;

ROLLIN TWP. -- Voters in Rollin Township will be asked Nov. 3 to replace the township's current millage for fire protection and prevention services that will expire at the end of 2020.


   


  The proposal asks to set the fire millage at 0.75 mill for 2021 through 2025. If approved, the owner of property with a taxable value of $100,000 would pay $75 a year. The township's current fire millage is 0.25 mill, or $25 a year for a property with a $100,000 taxable value.


   


  Residents in Rollin Township will not see the increase in taxes appear on bills until December 2021.


   


  Rollin Township Supervisor Irma David said there have been many expenditures recently at the Addison Fire Department that have brought the township to the point of going before the voters with a proposal to increase the millage.


   


  Expenditures at the fire department include rising expenses, maintenance and upkeep on vehicles, purchases and staffing costs.


   


  "There have been many major expenditures that have depleted the fire department's fund balance," David said. "There have been some other expenses come up that we were not aware of. We are glad to have found out about them now and not after the election."


   


  The millage proposal would help flow funds back into the fire department's fund balance.


   


  "We don't want to get behind with expenses of any kind," David added.


   


  The Addison Fire Department provides fire services and protection to the Rollin Township area. There is a joint agreement between the fire department and the village of Addison, Wheatland Township in Hillsdale County, Woodstock Township and Rollin that Addison will provide fire services for these communities.


   


  Dollars raised in these communities are funneled into the fire department through each of their respective fire millages. These dollars are then used to fund the fire department and its daily operations.


   


  Rollin Township has been supporting the fire department for the previous five years from the quarter-mill levy and from the general fund.


   


  David said it is imperative that proper fire care and protection is provided to the residents of Rollin Township. Approving the millage will allow that to continue, without the threat of falling into any financial pitfalls.


   


  "In order to ensure the residents will be able to receive quality fire protection, we have presented this millage increase to them," David said.


   


  If the proposal passes, the maximum amount that the township could collect would be $148,000 in the first year. David said it is unknown whether the township would need to levy the full amount if it passes.


   


  David said if the proposal is approved the township board will not have to go back to the voters down the road to ask to raise additional funds for the fire department. The department should be covered financially and well-maintained.


   


  Voters in Rollin Township will be able to vote in person at the Rollin Township Hall, 730 Manitou Beach Road, Manitou Beach, between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. Nov. 3.

Specifically, freezing digits can shed light on a thyroid issue. Your thyroid is like your body’s “battery pack,” says Dunston, as it sets the rate at which your body burns fuel. “The thyroid tells your body to open up the fat and get that fuel going,” she says. “That hormone is going to all your cells and telling them how to utilize fuel to function.”


  So when your thyroid is low, your machinery won’t run as well, so to speak. “It’s like all your cells don't want to get out of bed,” Dunston says. You might move slowly, feel tired, and—you guessed it—have poor circulation. That’s why some with low thyroid can’t seem to warm up. In fact, research showed that 40% of participants with low-thyroid felt more sensitive to cold. Another study touts cold intolerance as a skin manifestation of hypothyroidism (aka, the condition for underactive thyroid).


  Of course, that’s not to say if you have cold extremities you immediately have a hormonal issue—poor circulation can happen for a number of reasons, not all of them relating to hormones. It’s not always end-all-be-all, but Dunston recommends seeing the forest for the trees: Say, if you can’t lose stubborn weight and have trouble sleeping, anxiety, hair loss, _and_ cold hands and feet, you might want to check up on those hormones. “If you have any of those additional symptoms, that can alert you to a thyroid problem,” Dunston adds.

Trump wasn't on the ballot when they picked up the majority two years ago, and freshmen are often the most vulnerable to defeat as they seek reelection, especially this class of lawmakers now having to run alongside the president in districts often off-limits to Democrats.


  Pelosi pushed ahead with the risky House vote to impeach the president in late 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine only to see the Senate, controlled by Republicans, vote to acquit him of the charges in a highly charged political environment early this year.


  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Capitol abruptly shuttered. Pelosi engineered a rules change to allow the House to vote by proxy and work online, but it left lawmakers largely away from Washington. Now Pelosi is holding out for a robust COVID-19 aid package with the Trump administration, another risky move, seeking a $2 trillion-plus deal Republicans don't want to give.


  Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill, who is the chairwoman of the party's campaign arm in the House, said she counseled the new lawmakers not to get swept up in the national political debate but “run your race like you're running for mayor” — meeting with constituents and responding to issues close to home.


  “When we set out to do this work in 2019 we had no idea what this cycle would hold,” said Lucina Guinn, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's executive director.


  The goal, she said, was to make the incumbents “as strong as possible" while also recruiting new candidates “to set up a big battlefield.”

"Le migliaia di societa e gli impianti sportivi presenti nel Paese sono la vera casa dello sport che ogni giorno svolge una fondamentale azione di prevenzione per milioni di cittadini. Una categoria che non merita di essere ignorata e sbeffeggiata. Non accettiamo e non accetteremo di essere considerati secondari. Dopo la chiusura delle palestre, piscine e centri sportivi, attendiamo ora provvedimenti concreti e non parcellizzati e inadeguati. Chiediamo un fermo e immediato atto a tutela del sistema associazionistico sportivo da parte del Ministro Spadafora. Auspichiamo si possa tradurre immediatamente in un atto concreto, e che nei decreti di prossima pubblicazione ci siano interventi strutturali concreti come copertura di Stato per utenze e altre insostenibili spese strutturali per le associazioni e societa sportive e sostegni che tengano conto dei sacrifici gia sostenuti. Quel che emerge dall'ultimo decreto e che e ancora una volta lo sport a pagare. Siamo di fronte a una chiusura che doveva assolutamente essere evitata. A cio si aggiunga che i nostri governanti ben sapevano che si sarebbe potuti arrivare a una decisione di questo tipo che non e stata accompagnata da provvedimenti di sostegno immediati. Ci domandiamo: perche non hanno programmato per tempo? Il Mondo delle palestre, delle piscine e dei circoli sportivi, gia duramente provato dal periodo di lockdown, ha investito pesantemente su sanificazioni e infrastrutture, per adeguare i propri centri alle linee guida dettate dal Governo che, una settimana fa ha minacciato nuove e piu gravose chiusure ("daremo una settimana di tempo per adeguarsi ai protocolli di sicurezza"). Ora, il colpo finale - che mostra l'incoerenza di questo Governo - a strutture che, dai controlli effettuati, non avevano mostrato irregolarita. Lo sport viene trattato nel Dpcm come attivita non essenziale e, in qualche modo pericolosa, quando questa, invece, produce oltre a importanti economie anche benessere e salute. A pagare e lo sport. E, con lo sport, i cittadini italiani". Cosi il Sen. Claudio Barbaro Presidente ASI (Associazioni Sportive e Sociali Italiane).

For KL Rahul-led Kings XI Punjba, It has been a topsy-turvy season of the Indian Premier League 2020. The tournament in UAE started on a bad note for KXIP, as they lost six out of their first seven games. But the franchise has now made a stunning comeback, winning four games on the trot to push themselves in contention for making it through to the playoffs.


  While the road has not been an easy one for KL Rahul & co., former India cricketer and two-time IPL winning-captain Gautam Gambhir believes that a change in team formation has brought about the turnaround for KXIP. (IPL 2020 Full Coverage)


  KKR vs KXIP Live Score


  Gambhir credited young pacer Arshdeep Singh for his performance in the death overs, and said that he has provided Rahul with options in the death - which he did not have in the first seven games.


  "The best thing is that KL Rahul now has three fast bowlers to whom he can give the ball to in the death overs - Mohammed Shami, Chris Jordan and Arshdeep Singh," Gambhir said on ESPNCricinfo.


  "If you look at the first seven games for KXIP, KL Rahul had to search whom to give the overs to in the death overs. Now he has three options. When any captain has three options in the death - it is a luxury.


  "The credit for this I would like to give to Arshdeep Singh. Because Mohammed Shami and Chris Jordan are both international bowlers. But Arshdeep is a young, domestic cricketer and he has bowled well in the death overs. It has helped in changing the structure and compensation of the entire team since Arshdeep has been in the playing XI," he further said.

The construction will include two expanded, state-of-the-art orthopedic operating rooms to handle new technology and larger surgical teams, and a renovated main entry to the hospital. That portal will be named the Helen and Byron J. Matthews Entrance in honor of the former mayor – who was born at Anna Jaques – and his wife, who gave birth to their two sons at the hospital. The couple have served as volunteers and in other roles at the hospital for more than 60 years.


  Goldstein said the expansion plan had been in the works since 2017 and the Anna Jaques Community Health Foundation was well along with the “quiet phase” of fundraising rounding up support from larger donors when the pandemic hit.


  Mary Williamson, executive director of the foundation, said the organization began fundraising in fall 2018, with $3.5 million pledged or donated toward the Stepping Forward Campaign’s $4 million goal. That effort was launched with a $500,000 gift from the Gerrish Family Foundation.


  More than 45 donors have pledged $25,000 or more at the “Leadership” level, but now, she said, “We need donors in every position on the spectrum, large and small.”


  Now, the foundation has increased the goal and hopes to raise an additional $500,000 in the coming months “to really get us over the finish line.”


  “We’re very happy with the enthusiastic support we’ve received and want to invite the broader community to participate” through smaller donations, she said. One way to support the project is to purchase a commemorative brick for the hospital’s courtyards with a donation of $500 or $1,000.

“When you're in a position of leadership, you have to make incredibly tough decisions,” Racki said. “I think I empathize with him more than the people who are extremely angry or disappointed. He's not intentionally out there wanting to cancel high school or youth sports. He is doing the best he can with the information that he has. It's really easy to second-guess someone in that position, just like it’s easy to second-guess me when we lose the game on a call that I make or maybe as a school administrator. I'm going to do the best that I can and I know he's doing the same. Do I agree with everything? No, not really, but that's OK. I'm not into personally attacking people in positions of leadership because I understand. I can empathize with where they're at."

Barrera, the former "Lord of the Skies," has a few admirable traits, mainly his loyalty to a congenitally ill daughter (which Keller uses to lure him across the border), but once out of prison he's nothing but a monster, battling ruthlessly to regain his old seat and take his place as the first among equals in the cartels. He wants to be the man with the most money, the happiest family, the most beautiful mistress, and more power over life and death than anyone else. His struggle within the world of the cartels, and Keller's self-imposed vow to take him down, unfold with a starkness and grace — with shootings and beheadings and with revelatory scenes inside both the cartels and the DEA.

10) Capped Teeth and Caesar Salad  (Tell Me On a Sunday) Tell Me On a Sunday is one of Lloyd-Webber's less well known musicals, but the songs in the show are stupendously catchy - not least, Capped Teeth and Caesar Salad. I challenge you to not whistle along to the start of it. 09) All That Jazz  (Chicago) After all, there's no intro quite as … well … jazzy. 08) Let's Have Lunch  (Sunset Boulevard) This has to be one of Lloyd-Webber's catchiest intros. From the stunning Sunset Boulevard, the start of this song will be in your head for … forever … once you've listened to the it a couple of times. 07) Alexander Hamilton  (Hamilton) I can't wait for this show to land in the West End this year. And, like all great shows, the opening of the opening number is epic. 06) Grease  (Title Song) Every time I hear the first few notes of Grease, I am reminded why this show is still so popular. 05) No Me Diga (In The Heights) This is a slightly more obscure intro. Whilst all of Lin Manuel Miranda's intros are great, I particularly like this one from In The Heights. 04) Ten Duel Commandments  (Hamilton) After listening to the intro of this song, I don't think I've ever counted to 10 'normally' again. 03) Circle of Life  (The Lion King) Naaaaaaaaaa … I love the intro of this song. It can put you in a Disney mood instantaneously, and make you feel like climbing the nearest large rock and lifting your cat skywards (which, by the way, is not a good idea). 02) The Phantom of the Opera  (Title Song) If you've seen Phantom in the West End, you'll know how awesome it is when the orchestra bursts into the intro of the show's title song. You feel compelled to sing along to the instrumental intro ... Da da da da daaaaaaa … Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. 01) Summer Nights  (Grease) This iconic showtune intro is surely the best of the best. Wherever you are, whatever you doing, when you hear the opening notes of Summer Nights, we all know you're going to burst into song and dance. There are lots of great showtune intros out there, but I don't think any of them can quite compete with this.       Did I miss out any of your favourite showtune intros?

Se alla narrativa in singolo preferite sentirvi braccati in un gioco multiplayer, dovete puntare gli occhi su Dead by Daylight: in questo horror asimmetrico i giocatori vestono i panni di quattro sopravvissuti o di un killer che dà loro la caccia. È possibile scegliere quali personaggi interpretare e, mentre i malcapitati sono controllati in terza persona, quando vestite i panni del killer lo farete in soggettiva. Ideale per serate di orrore con gli amici, tra chi lotta per non farsi uccidere e chi è disposto a tutti per uccidere.

High unemployment has created a glut of candidates, though the process of finding the diamonds is laborious. Although the talent pool has grown, in many cases, the best candidates are still those who are currently employed. The good news is that with the advent of the virtual workplace, we have more prospects. Workers can live in one place and work remotely for a company located somewhere else. For recruiters and hiring managers, the key is to dig deep — beyond job postings and other traditional tactics — to find workers who are an ideal match for the jobs at hand.

Through the eyes of his alternately entranced and exasperated daughters, we see how attractive a man like Cam can be to children, and how incomprehensible to grownups, his own wife included. Yet Maggie, caught between worry for her kids and trying to make ends meet, remains a shadowy figure throughout. Saldana seems ill at ease and slightly at a loss in a role that demands little of her other than to wring her hands while coming and going from Manhattan. In principle it's a relief to see a biracial marriage onscreen without fuss. But this is 1978, in highly race-conscious Boston, where a union between a black woman and a WASP from old money would surely not go unremarked on by Cam's Brahmin family or by Maggie's prospective white-shoe employers. There's not a peep out of either.

ANDOVER -- Every time in practice, Newton has this drill where they go through, preparing as they are down late in the set. They go through it like clockwork, preparing for the pressures of a late set rally. On Saturday afternoon, it paid off.
   
 On Saturday the Newton Railers rallied in the third set against top seeded Andover (25-22, 20-25, 25-21) to win the sub-state Championship in three sets by winning the game's final four points.
   
 "We work on that drill every day," Asha Regier said. "We knew what we had to do because coach had prepared us."
   
 It also helped Newton (23-11) had beaten Andover (25-6) earlier in the week, so confidence was brimming.
   
 "We knew we were going to get their best shot when we beat them on Tuesday," Newton head coach Jamie Dibbens said. "I'm proud of how we fought today."
   
 After dispatching of Andover Central in the sub-state semifinals in straight sets, it set up the tough match against Andover, who beat Emporia in straight sets.
   
 Newton wasted little time putting the Trojans on their heels, jump up early in the first set 5-1 before Andover finally was able to grab their bearings.
   
 The Railers pushed out on a 6-2 run, giving themselves a 20-16 advantage in the first set. They close out strong, winning the first 25-22.
   
 After dropping the second set, Newton once again pounced, going up 13-6 in the third set, mainly off the service of freshman libero, Abigail Koontz.
   
 "When I saw her the first day in practice, I knew she was going to be starting varsity," Regier said. "It's great having someone that can lead already like that."
   
 Andover made a push, fighting back on six straight points and eventually took the lead 21-20, forcing a Newton into a timeout.
   
 "We've been there before," Dibbens said. "We play in a really tough league and it's prepared us for these situations."

 Newton came out and set up Regier on a kill and then after Andover had been hitting soft shots to steal points, Newton adjusted and made the Trojans pay.
   
 The Railers will now host fourth-ranked Bishop Carroll (24-2) in the quarterfinals at Newton on Tuesday at 6 p.m. The match will be best-of-five sets. The winner advances to a four-team pool Saturday at the Tony's Pizza Event Center in Salina, followed by the semifinals and finals.
   
 There will be limited attendance at both the quarterfinal match and at state.

Where was Jerick McKinnon? He came in as a third-down specialist (they were 5-of-9 on third-down conversions) and his sparse use (three carries, minus-1 yard) will pay off next week as the more likely starter than Hasty in Seattle. Tevin Coleman has a chance to come off injured reserve, but Raheem Mostert is out at last two more games. Kyle Juszczyk scored his second rushing touchdown in three games, but Shanahan also made sure to praise his blocking and leadership as "the best fullback in the game. He's been huge for our team since he's been here." Juszczyk's contract expires at season's end.

ANSA) - GENOVA, 26 OTT -    Si è presentata in questura la passeggera che era a bordo della Bmw che sabato sera a Genova è piombata in piazzetta Pedegoli nel quartiere di Quezzi, falciando quattro ragazzine, tra cui una incinta. La giovane di 21 anni è stata denunciata per omissione di soccorso. Il conducente della vettura, L.B. di 23 anni, è stato arrestato ieri per lesioni personali stradali gravissime e omissione di soccorso. Secondo le testimonianze raccolte dagli agenti della polizia municipale e dalla polizia di Stato, il ragazzo sarebbe arrivato a tutta velocità e, dopo avere perso il controllo, ha travolto uno scooter che ha preso fuoco. La macchina e la moto hanno travolto quattro ragazzine, tra i 16 e i 19 anni, due delle quali rimaste ferite in modo grave.    Il giovane, invece di prestare soccorso, ha tolto la parte anteriore della vettura che era rimasta incastrata ed è scappato. La polizia lo ha trovato dopo diverse ore mentre cercava di nascondersi.(ANSA).

Cupertino benötigt hochkarätige Blockbuster, um seinem Streamingdienst Apple TV+ einen Schub zu verleihen: Der Konzern verfolgt eine andere Strategie als Netflix und will durch wenige, aber qualitativ hochwertige Inhalte begeistern. Zuletzt sicherte sich der Konzern etwa Sofia Coppolas "On the Rocks" mit Bill Murray und Rashida Jones in den Hauptrollen sowie die Musikdokumentation "Letter to You" von Bruce Springsteen. Doch für 600 Millionen US-Dollar müsste der Konzern eine Menge Abonnements abschließen, um die Kosten auch nur ansatzweise hereinzubekommen.

I always looked to older actors and observed how they worked, and shut up and listen to their stories. Joan Sydney and Shane Porteous in A Country Practice come to mind. I’ve been acting a long time and I always notice who is true to the work, who is lazy and who just phones it in. The ones that make a fuss are always the ones trying to disguise the fact they’re not very good at their job!

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], October 26 (ANI/BusinessWire India): Scenic Communication, a boutique, integrated communications agency has successfully on-boarded 14 new clients, in the midst of market adversity. As a 5 year old agency, the challenging market scenario had been crucial and the agency navigated these with an agile approach to client servicing and business development that helped them to not only survive the adverse conditions but to emerge stronger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Adding to their already diversified client portfolio, Scenic communication now represents Goavega Software, an IT solutions providing organization, Secure Layer 7, a cyber-security firm, School Diary, a SAAS based Ed-Tech firm, and WeRWellness, a wellness firm co-founded by former South-African cricketer Jonty Rhodes. Each of these firms are significant players in their respective domains and have reached out to Scenic Communication for their specialized and result oriented communication needs - a testimonial to the agencies past success stories and commitment to deliver impactful strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "The pandemic and the corresponding lockdown brought with it an economic uncertainty at a national and global level. The marketing and communication sector also was impacted, as brands reacted to the economic slowdown by cutting out PR and advertising budgets. This immediately prompted us to re-evaluate our current client engagement and go back to the drawing board, for coming up with a new, relevant business strategy. This approach, coupled with our quality of work, commitment and ability to deliver in adverse conditions, ability to adapt quickly and go beyond the call of duty, enabled us not only to retain existing clients, but also to sign on new ones. This was one of our biggest learnings and certainly an aspect that would be very helpful in times ahead," said Anindita Gupta, co-founder, Scenic Communication, while speaking about the agile business development strategy and the addition of four new clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For surviving in a harsh market environment, the necessity of an effective 'survival' strategy is an absolute must. Keeping this in mind, Scenic evaluated the economic conditions to thoroughly understand the current market scenario, what that meant for our clients and how we could help. In the pre-COVID period Scenic's strategy included targeting international travel boards, international economic boards, expanding our own operations and opening new offices, etc. As a result, the leadership team had been focusing on international brands looking to expand into Indian markets, Indian brands looking to expand overseas, new business alliances with international agencies, as well as smaller projects in India.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            With the pandemic, however, all business plans were put on hold and re-evaluated. After studying the new situation, and understanding the uncertain duration of the adverse market conditions, the agency employed two key strategic changes. One, for new business development, it shifted its focus from long term retainer accounts to short term or project based engagements, which are generally overlooked by agencies. This received a good response as it allowed brands to engage for relevant and specific campaigns, without having to commit for long term retainer fees. And it worked wonders because after a good experience with the initial engagement, the agency earned the trust and secured a retainer client, whenever they would be ready for a long term engagement which help us to bag them as retainers. The second shift was that of stepping up to support the existing clients in their hour of need, irrespective of their monetary engagement. The team not only stood with the clients in the need of hour but also went above and beyond the call of duty, creating value for their business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Additionally, Scenic's senior management was instrumental in recognizing the symbiotic relation with its all-important execution team, who had been working harder than ever from their homes, juggling several personal and professional challenges. With careful hand holding, close daily and weekly interactions and supportive policies, the combined effort paid rich dividends in not just retaining clients and adding more business but also building a stronger, close knit team that is now a family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The pandemic has tested the resolve of several brands and businesses and under such circumstances, only those having flexibility and the alertness to react to the situation promptly, would thrive. Going forward, as the VUCA (Volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) scenario dominates the new normal, marketing and communication industry too needs to adopt an agile and client supportive strategy, which can go a long way in helping businesses stay afloat.

CSK lost their chance to qualify for the playoffs after Rajasthan Royals defeated table toppers Mumbai Indians by 8-wickets on Sunday (October 26). Rajasthan were at the bottom of the table before the start of their game on Sunday, but their comprehensive win ensured that CSK fell short of a playoff berth for the first time in their history.

T-minus eight days and counting until finally, mercifully, we can put paid to the presidential election of 2020. Does that mean we'll know the winner? Well, with untested new technologies for the avalanches of early, regular and absentee voting, and of course the meddlesome Russians and maybe the Iranians, who knows when we'll have the final results.

As for the final box score, our FishOn birthday is Feb. 8. That's where we'll set the over/under for the final numbers. Barring, of course, decades of legal challenges.

According to state law that means voters and others can’t make any “visible display or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate or measure on the ballot.” Banned stuff includes, but isn’t limited to, the following:

Of course, I’m well aware of the seriousness of severe alcohol dependency. Over the years I have watched people close to me struggle with addiction. I’m not an advocate for alcohol as a stressbuster or an escape. I know what a slippery slope this can be. But I am a supporter of mothers cutting themselves some slack during the pandemic, for the sake of our emotional wellbeing.

"I typically lean toward being a Democrat, but I also lean toward voting for whomever is going to provide this country with what we most need at the time," Harrison said. "Whether that is a Democrat or a Republican, I leave that to the person. For now, I can assure you that I am not a fan of Donald Trump. I don't think that he is doing great things for our country. So I am swaying toward Biden."


  Braeden Zellen is an 18-year-old Amesbury resident and will vote for the first time in November. The Amesbury High School senior said he has not decided who to back in the presidential race.


  "They have both been a part of some sketchy stuff," Zellen said. "Both of them have accusations flying about them, left and right. So you really have to do your job and decide what is fake and what is true in the media right now."


  Social media has played a large role in the 2020 election campaigns, according to Harrison.


  "Social media is a great thing to have and we're very fortunate to have it but it can also be very negative toward finding out legitimate information about these candidates," she said.


  Black Lives Matter protests and even riots have broken out across the country after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May. Zellen said the protests did not influence his vote but he wants to see "change and justice in America."


  "I want to see everyone treated equally and given fair opportunities," Zellen said. "If the current president can't do that and the next one might be able to then, yeah, that might influence my vote."


  Harrison said the COVID-19 pandemic and race relations are her two most important issues.


  "The economy is important but Trump should be focusing on those things, too," Harrison said. "And, from what I have seen, it always ends up being about money. That, is of course, important. But there are other important things, in my opinion. Joe Biden seems to be more human. He appears to be for the people and that is what this country is all about, 'We the People.'"

Following his victory, Nurmagomedov said: "This was my last fight. There's no way I'm going to come here without my father. … After what happened with my father — when UFC called me about Justin — I talked with my mother [for] three days, 'should I go fight without my father?' I promised her it was gonna be my last fight. And if I give my word, I have to follow it."  Nurmagomedov lost his father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, in July due to COVID-19 complications.

“El entorno social a nivel mundial cada día está peor y Puerto Rico no es la excepción. Es necesario mirar con profundidad cuales son los factores que inciden en esta problemática. No es encarcelando a nuestra juventud o continuar viéndoles morir en las calles como atacamos los problemas sociales que nos aquejan. Para el 2019 en Puerto Rico teníamos 360 mil niños menores de 8 años de los que 117 mil eran menores de 4 años. De estos, el 36% vivía solo con su madre soltera, sin la figura del padre. Algunos de estos niños reciben el sustento a través de órdenes judiciales, pero los tribunales no pueden ordenar el afecto y la protección que son tan necesarios en sus vidas”, expresó Díaz en declaraciones escritas.

If Californians do not continue what we started, these discoveries could be left on the shelf, delaying lifesaving and life-changing treatments for decades. The reality is California is the only state with the infrastructure and intellectual capital to continue this charge of advancing promising medical discoveries and clinical trials through to widely available, FDA-approved treatments. There is no other entity -- private or public -- that can take it from here and to the scale that we as a state can. We've seen time and time again where the federal government has been inconsistent when it comes to funding breakthrough stem cell research.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan said Monday it will not sign a U.N. treaty that bans nuclear weapons and does not welcome its entry into force next year, rejecting the wishes of atomic bomb survivors in Japan who are urging the government to join and work for a nuclear-free world. The United Nations confirmed Saturday that 50 countries have ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, paving the way for its entry into force in 90 days. The announcement was hailed by anti-nuclear activists, but the treaty has been strongly opposed by the United States and other major nuclear powers. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan shares the goal of achieving a nuclear-free world, but does not think the treaty is the way to go. “Japan's approach is different from that of the treaty, and there is no change to our position not to sign it, as we have said,” Kato told reporters Monday. “We doubt if support is growing even among non-nuclear weapons states, let alone nuclear weapons states.\" Japan has said that it is not realistic to pursue the treaty with nuclear powers and non-nuclear weapons states sharply divided over it. Kato said Japan has chosen instead to serve as a bridge to narrow the gap between the two sides. Asked if Japan at least welcomes the treaty taking effect next year, Kato only repeated Japan's position. Japan has decided not to sign the treaty even though it is the world’s only country to have suffered nuclear attacks and has renounced its own possession, production or hosting of nuclear weapons. That is because Japan hosts 50,000 American troops and is protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Its post-World War II security pact with the U.S. also complicates efforts to get Japan to sign the treaty as it beefs up its own military to deal...

This is the most important time of year for the mart trade and I am calling on Minister McConalogue to urgently address this.

On the side of the law stands Art "Killer" Keller, a former CIA field agent who worked for the DEA for 30 years; a real loner, but he got his job done. Having put his personal nemesis, Adán Barrera, "the most powerful drug patrón in the world," behind bars in an American jail, he dropped off the radar (with the silent blessing of his DEA bosses) and when we first meet him he's in self-imposed isolation working as a bee-keeper at a monastery in New Mexico. But when the gangster makes a deal with the U.S. government it's as though a giant fist has upended a chess board: If the U.S. will send him back to Mexico to complete his prison term in a Mexican penitentiary, Barerra will give up a fellow drug kingpin.

Asaduddin Owaisi, the president of the All India Majlis-e- Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), addressed a rally in poll-bound Bihar on Sunday afternoon and sought votes on behalf of the party's state unit chief, Akhatrul Iman.He also took the opportunity to condemn both the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), who are part of the Grand Alliance (GA), or the mahagathbandhan, for their studied silence over the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 and the National Register for Citizens (NRC)."When you were holding protests against the CAA, 2019 and the NRC in Seemanchal, both the Congress and RJD neither extended their support nor did say anything. They had preferred to remain silent," Owaisi alleged."Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and his party the Janata Dal (United) are sitting on the lap of the BJP and Mohan Bhagwat, the sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)," he further alleged.Purnia, Kishanganj, Katihar and Araria districts comprise the Seemanchal, which has a total of 24 seats and a substantial Muslim population. Also read | 'Party hoppers' may hold key afterwardsOwaisi addressed a rally, which saw an impressive turnout, at Machhatta in Amour in Purnia district on Sunday afternoon. He reacted sharply over Bhagwat's comment during its annual Vijayadashami speech that Muslim brothers have been misguided about the CAA, 2019 and said that "Muslims are no longer kids".He spoke out about the vexed issue of "Muslim infiltrators in Seemanchal" and lashed out at the RJD and the Congress leaders for their studied silence. "It is only AIMIM and its leader Akhatrul Iman, who has raised the issue seeking justice for the Muslims, who have been denigrated as infiltrators in Seemanchal for long," he said.He also raised the issue of Seemanchal's backwardness. "If you can help us win elections, we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that Seemanchal no longer remains backward," he promised. "Our leaders along with people of Seemanchal will rush to CM in Patna to get the development work done," he promised.He cited his hometown Hyderabad's recent flood tragedy and said "I went to the (Telangana) CM's house at midnight, when floodwaters entered into the houses of the people and asked him to act promptly to give relief to those affected."He took a dig at the development model of Bihar CM Kumar. "Hospitals are without doctors and schools are without teachers. We can't leave you in this deplorable condition any longer," he promised to the voters. AIMIM leaders have lavished praises on the late Mohmmed Taslimuddin of the RJD for his untiring efforts to alleviate the conditions of the poor people from Seemanchal.Taslimuddin's son Shahnawaz Alam is contesting the Jokihat seat on AIMIM ticket against his elder brother and RJD candidate, Sarfaraz Alam. AIMIM is contesting in 24 assembly seats in Bihar. The party is focusing on Seemanchal, where it had opened its account in the state in a by-poll last year. AIMIM candidate Qamrul Hoda had defeated the Congress nominee in Kishanganj, which is considered to be the grand old party's bastion.Seemanchal will vote on November 7, the last phase of the Bihar elections. The first two phases will be held on October 28 and November 3.The election results for the 243-member Bihar legislative assembly will be declared on November 10.

Nearly 80% of donation centers in the U.S. are strategically located in low- income areas, home to people barely able – or unable – to make ends meet. Critics have claimed that the companies purposefully open facilities in such areas under the assumption that desperate people are much more likely to regularly go under the needle to supplement their income than those who are more financially secure.

"Rivolgo un cordiale saluto a tutti i partecipanti all'Assemblea della CNA che si tiene in presenza di una crisi molto dura, che colpisce comparti e lavoratori, taluni in modo più grave come avviene per le piccole imprese. Un periodo di straordinaria difficoltà che va affrontato con il necessario sostegno da parte delle Autorità Pubbliche: servono politiche condivise - col contributo di parti sociali e territori - per una strategia che, mentre affronta la pandemia e le difficoltà conseguenti, sia rivolta a colmare divari e ridurre diseguaglianze sempre più inaccettabili e onerose". E' quanto si legge nel messaggio che il Presidente della Repubblica Sergio Mattarella ha inviato al presidente della Confederazione nazionale dell'artigianato e della Piccola e media impresa Daniele Vaccarino. "Un rischio che non possiamo correre è che alle disuguaglianze tra territori esistenti nel nostro Paese si aggiungano quelle derivanti da effetti della pandemia", dice il presidente della Repubblica Sergio Mattarella. "Anche guardando al di là dell'emergenza ogni progetto di ripartenza e di crescita sostenibile passa inevitabilmente per la capacità di ogni istituzione di innovare e di intraprendere percorsi virtuosi e, al tempo stesso, per la capacità del sistema di offrire opportunità a chi oggi ne ha meno, di intervenire sugli squilibri ambientali e le sperequazioni territoriali".

A candid article penned by journalist Darryl Lorenzo Wellington titled, “The Twisted Business of Donating Plasma,” detailed his donor experience for The Atlantic. At the time, Wellington, struggling to make ends meet, decided to join the thousands already relying on the steady income from plasma donations. “My rent was due. I had insufficient funds in the bank. I was 48 years old, a journalist running short on cash from writing assignments and odd jobs. That was when I saw an ad offering $50 per plasma donation: blood money, or more specifically, payment for my time and any small pain involved in the process of having protein-rich plasma extracted from the blood,” he said.

Vail was built from scratch in the 1960s. The founders envisaged a “little Bavaria” in Colorado, based on their experiences in the Alps while serving in the 10th Mountain Division of the US Army. While Vail is huge, stretching almost four miles along the (remarkably unobtrusive) I-70 highway from Denver, the original Vail Village is a very pleasant place to stroll around, full of Bavarian/Tirolean-style buildings.

  Orthopedic surgery at Anna Jaques has doubled over the past 10 years, according to hospital officials. In 2015, the hospital introduced Mako robotic-arm assisted surgery for hip and knee replacements.


  The clinical partnership with New England Baptist Hospital “both reinforces and strengthens the ongoing commitment to excellent quality outcomes and patient-centered care within the local community,” Goldstein said.


  “AJH is the destination for outstanding orthopedic surgery and post-surgical care in our region, offering a high-quality patient experience and an environment that can lead to faster healing – all close to home,” he said.


  Wayne Capolupo of Salisbury, a hospital trustee and chair of the building committee, said in a statement, “Understandably, people have a very high expectation level today. They not only want great medical care, they want an exceptional patient experience. This project will deliver both for our patients.”


  David LaFlamme, chair of the Anna Jaques board of trustees, underscored the role people in Greater Newburyport can play in this final part of the fundraising campaign.


  “As we have for over 135 years, Anna Jaques relies on the community’s philanthropic support to maintain our high standard of quality care close to home,” he said in a statement from the hospital. “Donors to this campaign, especially in this final, public phase, can make a real difference in providing the best possible surgical experience.”


  All gifts made to the Stepping Forward Campaign and to the Anna Jaques Community Health Foundation stay in the community to support the hospital. For more about the Stepping Forward Campaign, contact Mary Williamson at 978-463-1211 or visit ajh.org/stepping forward.

Let's not stomp all over a great story, though. Sure, that level of turnover ridiculousness won't continue, and sure, Michigan State might turn out to be quite bad. But everyone who plays college football deserves a win like this occasionally, and Rutgers' time had come. Even if it was driven mostly by State's total inability to hold on to the football, Rutgers played with a level of belief we haven't seen in a while, and the Scarlet Knights' postgame win expectancy was 63%, which suggests this wasn't _only_ turnover-driven.
 Plus, while only a couple of other non-Rutgers Big Ten teams grade out worse than Michigan State at the moment (Illinois, Maryland), Rutgers gets to play both of them! A 3-5 start to Greg Schiano's second head-coaching tenure isn't out of the question.
 As downright awful as 2020 has been in so many different ways, it has managed one seemingly impossible feat: It has given Rutgers fans hope.

"My worry is if we don't pass another stimulus, the economy could fall into a tailspin," he said recently during a campaign stop at a Binghamton gas station, where he learned to fill up a propane-fueled bus as workers spaced out in a circle asked for more investment.

Hitting back at claims she's been using filters, the Diva Forever star told fans: "There's been a few comments recently about filters, but I have been having some amazing face treatments done - moisturising, skin tightening, I had a little injection in my chin to take some fat out of my chin.

About 500 rhesus macaques were brought to the island from India in 1938, Rawlins says, and that was a mission with a lot of challenges. About 50 monkeys died at sea during a 47-day voyage. And the scientists didn't really know how to set up the island before the monkeys arrived.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she hopes the House, the Senate and the White House can iron out some disagreements on a new stimulus bill and get things rolling this week. That's despite the fact she and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows spent yesterday accusing each other of moving the goalposts on stimulus talks. Meadows said Republicans aren't going to opine or vote on a bill before they've read it. President Trump is stuck between a rock and a hard place here: Negotiating a deal before the election would help millions of struggling Americans at a critical political juncture, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has privately told the White House a pre-election stimulus decision wouldn't garner support from Senate Republicans.

A candid article penned by journalist Darryl Lorenzo Wellington titled, “The Twisted Business of Donating Plasma,” detailed his donor experience for The Atlantic. At the time, Wellington, struggling to make ends meet, decided to join the thousands already relying on the steady income from plasma donations. “My rent was due. I had insufficient funds in the bank. I was 48 years old, a journalist running short on cash from writing assignments and odd jobs. That was when I saw an ad offering $50 per plasma donation: blood money, or more specifically, payment for my time and any small pain involved in the process of having protein-rich plasma extracted from the blood,” he said.

Dubai [UAE], October 26 (ANI): Chennai Super Kings batsman Ruturaj Gaikwad, who guided his team to an eight-wicket win against Royal Challengers Bangalore, said that he has been wanting to bat with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni since the camp kicked off in Chennai.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CSK comfortably chased down the target of 146 with eight wickets in hand and 8 balls to spare. Ruturaj Gaikwad played an unbeaten knock of 65 runs to take the side over the line. He shared an unbeaten 37-run stand with Dhoni while chasing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Ruturaj said he always dreamt of batting along with Dhoni but didn't get many opportunities during last year's IPL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "I am feeling good but personal milestone doesn't matter much until and unless you win for your team. I was part of the squad last year and this year also I didn't get many chances this year also, so this means a lot," Gaikwad told bowler Deepak Chahar in a video posted on iplt20.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "I was dreaming from the day you know when the camp started in Chennai and I had a feeling I might get a game and was hoping to play with Mahi bhai and obviously make a partnership. It helps me a lot, coming it from Mahi Bhai that keeps focusing on the next games," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chahar bowled brilliantly and picked the important wicket of AB de Villiers. The right-handed bowler gave away 31 runs in 4 overs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "I was confident bowling at death as I bowl 3 overs in the powerplay where only two players are allowed. Even last year, I bowled in the death overs, so I was pretty confident bowling in the crucial overs," said Chahar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With this win, CSK has risen to the seventh spot in the points table with eight points from 12 matches while RCB is in the third spot with 14 points.

Former Netherlands boss Marco van Basten has questioned Donny van de Beek's decision to join Manchester United.

For the very first time, rage instead of desperation took hold of me. How dare he? How could he talk of marriage to Nancy in the same breath as he spoke of our divorce? _By God_ , I thought, _if he wants this shameful divorce, I will get what I want as well_.

I think it was quite important to get the history right, but we have a big resource in the book, which is immaculately detailed and researched. It was very important to us in general to make the world seem real, and not only in the kind of setup of the history and the detail of it and how kind of gritty and dirty and real everything looks. But also in the human stories. Because I think the thing that can be alienating about fantasy is that it expects you to take a huge leap of faith into a completely unfamiliar world — and really magic, for us, is something that comes organically out of this world and out of real people.

A study in the European Journal of Psychotraumatology in 2017 suggests that women generally score higher than men on the acute subjective responses and predictors associated with PTSD primarily because they have evolved to handle traumatic or stressful situations differently. This study suggests that instead of the assumed fight-or-flight response to a traumatic event (which men more frequently respond with) women tend to react with a tend-and-befriend response.

Disney, like many high-profile American corporations in recent years, has been lacing its films, shows and cultural offerings with social justice messaging, to the delight or irritation of various fan groups.
 For anyone taken in by corporate virtue signaling, however, allow us to disillusion you: It’s all about the bottom line.
 Take Disney. For such a gilded company that professes loudly and sanctimoniously about human rights, institutional discrimination and the importance of representation, the social media-driven “#BoycottMulan” movement that flared up in the wake of the company’s most recently released live-action adaptation must be embarrassing.
 And it should be. The boycott movement’s grievances focused on the fact that in the film’s credits, Disney thanks a number of government entities in westernmost Xinjiang province, home to the country’s Uighur population. The Uighurs are a Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic minority facing increasing persecution under the Chinese Communist Party. The United Nations has stated that more than 1 million Uighurs are being held in modern-day concentration camps.
 Add to this the CCP’s speech-blocking of the social media hashtag #BoycottMulan and star actor Liu Yifei’s public support for Hong Kong police, criticized for tactics in quelling pro-democracy protesters in recent months, and Disney has a full-on hypocritical rodeo on its hands.
 According to this corporation, police brutality is America’s greatest sin currently, but it’s OK in China. Our democracy is eroding and must be protected, but never mind the Chinese Communist Party’s imposition of “National Security Law” in Hong Kong this summer. The United States’ treatment of minorities is disgusting, but turn the other cheek when China actively imprisons more than a million of its own citizens for posing a genetic and cultural threat.
 The two-facedness is unbelievable.
 U.S. politicians have been increasingly vocal in condemnation of China in the run-up to the November presidential election, from concerns about intellectual privacy and military games to data mining and the country’s questionable communication in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic.
 Corporations like Disney should be ashamed of sacrificing their ethical standards for the sake of accessing the lucrative film market in China.
 If they’re going to move into the business of selling virtue, they should condemn evil at home or abroad, regardless of the market value.
 After all, if corporations are going to pretend to have souls, then they should show guilt when caught in acts of bad faith.

It's housed in a smart two-piece 3D-printed frame that hooks over the top of the monitor and locates with an area of screen into which you can place your teleprompter software. This is a world into which we haven't previously delved, so aside from the array of Windows freeware that pops up in a Google search we found there are a few opensource offerings. There is TeleKast which appears to be no longer updated, and Imaginary Teleprompter, which even has an online version you can try in a web browser.

Whether it be Jimin squealing "Jimmy" in a cute way or Jin waiting with open arms ready to embrace Fallon while RM gets the warmest hug possible from the beloved talk show host, it was indeed a heartwarming 'uwu' moment for ARMY.

But he ignored quarantine orders and flew to Hong Kong, and then traveled by bus to another city in China, in the Guandong Province.

For KL Rahul-led Kings XI Punjba, It has been a topsy-turvy season of the Indian Premier League 2020. The tournament in UAE started on a bad note for KXIP, as they lost six out of their first seven games. But the franchise has now made a stunning comeback, winning four games on the trot to push themselves in contention for making it through to the playoffs.


  While the road has not been an easy one for KL Rahul & co., former India cricketer and two-time IPL winning-captain Gautam Gambhir believes that a change in team formation has brought about the turnaround for KXIP. (IPL 2020 Full Coverage)


  KKR vs KXIP Live Score


  Gambhir credited young pacer Arshdeep Singh for his performance in the death overs, and said that he has provided Rahul with options in the death - which he did not have in the first seven games.


  "The best thing is that KL Rahul now has three fast bowlers to whom he can give the ball to in the death overs - Mohammed Shami, Chris Jordan and Arshdeep Singh," Gambhir said on ESPNCricinfo.


   


   


  "If you look at the first seven games for KXIP, KL Rahul had to search whom to give the overs to in the death overs. Now he has three options. When any captain has three options in the death - it is a luxury.


  "The credit for this I would like to give to Arshdeep Singh. Because Mohammed Shami and Chris Jordan are both international bowlers. But Arshdeep is a young, domestic cricketer and he has bowled well in the death overs. It has helped in changing the structure and compensation of the entire team since Arshdeep has been in the playing XI," he further said.


  KXIP face off against KKR on Monday.

A study in the _European Journal of Psychotraumatology_ in 2017 suggests that women generally score higher than men on the acute subjective responses and predictors associated with PTSD primarily because they have evolved to handle traumatic or stressful situations differently. This study suggests that instead of the assumed fight-or-flight response to a traumatic event (which men more frequently respond with) women tend to react with a tend-and-befriend response.

"My worry is if we don't pass another stimulus, the economy could fall into a tailspin," he said recently during a campaign stop at a Binghamton gas station, where he learned to fill up a propane-fueled bus as workers spaced out in a circle asked for more investment.

Her show is the first addition into the expanding "Babish Culinary Universe", a rebrand of Andrew Rea's popular "Binging With Babish" channel. Just weeks after it started, "Stump Sohla" is driving an average of 2.3 million views per post, and added 30,000 new subscribers to the channel in one day, according to YouTube figures.


  "Binging With Babish" started in February 2006 as a cooking program that recreates meals from pop culture and TV shows (the name pays homage to a "West Wing" character). Over 14 years, Rea had a slew of viral hits. The Moist Maker, a Thanksgiving leftover sandwich from "Friends," put him on the map, Rea said. The simple Italian pasta dish featured in "Chef," more than 8.6 million views. And the titular dish from "Ratatouille" is his most-viewed video, with more than 24.4 million watches.


  "We're doing everything we can to not let the pandemic interrupt our growth," Rea said. "Because I think now more than ever, not only are people turning to YouTube for entertainment, but also just for escapism."


  Since the pandemic stopped life in its tracks in mid-March, the average daily views of videos with "cook with me" in the title have increased by over 100%, according to data provided by YouTube.


  Earnest Pettie, who leads YouTube's global trends research, said that food trends at the beginning of the pandemic included sourdough bread, then Dalgona coffee, Basque burnt cheesecake and, now, "island" cakes. The recipe for a successful YouTube channel, he said, is including people in a social conversation that teaches them something new or helps them feel better about themselves.


  But the most important ingredient is authenticity -- an "it" factor that can't be manufactured, Rea said. It's the difference, he said, between YouTube content and a television cooking show where all you see is "this beautiful, perfect person making beautiful, perfect food on their first try."


  And that was what Rea said drove him to direct message El-Waylly on Instagram in June, and ultimately decide she was the perfect person to help him expand his digital food network.


  "We've been waiting for the opportunity to find somebody new for the channel that was a great fit for our culture and philosophy of being goofballs and having fun while being entertaining and informative, and she embodies that and so much more," Rea said.


  After leaving Bon Appetit, El-Waylly initially announced she would still create digital and magazine content for the brand. But last week she said on Instagram that she ended her "relationship" with the brand. Several of her fellow test kitchen colleagues have also left.


  The highly publicized internal turmoil at Bon Appetit sent the brand into a tailspin that included a four-month absence from its YouTube channel, which it started adding new content to this month.


  When asked if El-Waylly's exit from Bon Appetit and the void left by its hiatus was an impetus for Rea's expansion of his channel, he said no, adding "that's not really how YouTube works."


  "People decide what they want to watch and who they want to lift up," he said.


  Rea has long had a devoted following on his channel, which YouTube data shows is among the top food programs on the platform, with more than 8 million subscribers and over 1.5 billion channel views.


  He has been building out the channel's offerings for years, adding a beginner-friendly show called "Basics With Babish" in 2017 and expanding into lifestyle content two years later with "Being With Babish." It features Rea traveling across the country connecting with fans.


  That evolution, and frequent crossover episodes with other YouTube personalities and celebrities, gave way to Babish Culinary Universe -- a name Rea says was suggested by fans as a nod to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


  A crossover El-Waylly wants to make happen? A collaboration with Sean Evans' popular "Hot Ones" series, where guests eat increasingly spicy chicken wings while being interviewed -- but she wants to make all the hot sauces herself.


  One of the lessons Rea says he has learned over his YouTube career is to always film every time you cook. He noted that the audience really responds to his process -- namely, his mistakes.


  "I want people to see it's OK to make mistakes because they're learning opportunities," he said. "Everything that I am and everything that I have been able to do is the product of me being able to learn from and grow from my mistakes."


  That is what he hopes will be part of his legacy -- and something he wants to focus on in a memoir he's thinking about writing.


  When asked what he'd call it, he stopped, thought for a minute and said, "I Done F----\- Up."

We also expect our country’s executive to perform the fundamental, necessary work of both leading the federal government and appointing key people to important roles within it. More than 1 in 10 of some 1,200 key administration posts requiring Senate confirmation are still unfilled, with no nominee put forth by the White House, according to a tracker maintained by Partnership for Public Service and the Washington Post. Alarmingly, the Department of Homeland Security is the most unmoored of all federal agencies, with only a third of its key posts permanently filled. Even its secretary, Chad Wolf, serves in an acting capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As these jobs go unfilled, the government’s work isn’t done. There may be no more chilling example than the ineffectual Federal Election Commission. The country’s most important watchdog of political spending has spent all but five weeks of this year without enough commissioners to perform its most important tasks. With less than two weeks to go from a national election, here we are playing without a ref.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            We expect Biden to restore decency and decorum to the Oval Office, to respect and uphold the First Amendment and freedom of the press, and to forcefully decry violent extremists. We expect the president of the United States to release his tax returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is not as straightforward an election as some would make it seem. The Democratic Party has done the country no favors by offering a candidate who, if elected and healthy, will celebrate his 80th birthday in the White House. But of the available options, Biden is the clear choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In addition to this milestone election, next month will mark five decades since Biden entered elected office, in the Philadelphia suburbs of northern Delaware.

For nearly seven years, Dávila and the Campanario team — a mighty six-person crew — have been working behind the scenes, developing content for major Hollywood players like Netflix, Amazon and Bravo, in an effort to bolster Latinx representation on screen, one project at a time, in the U.S. and abroad. And with “Selena: The Series,” perhaps the company’s highest-profile project to date, the hope is to achieve the sort of mainstream success that will open more doors for content about, and made by, Latinos in an industry that remains overwhelmingly white despite pledges for greater diversity and inclusion.

But what Tories do most of all, in the Hare universe, is behave corruptly. The series began with Laurence’s triumph in a libel case against a newspaper that had accused him of receiving backhanders. It is made clear from that moment onwards that he is obviously guilty and, even better, has been having his palm greased by people in Washington DC who are in bed with the Republicans. Laurence’s personal secretary is also party to his corruption; his Special Adviser is loyal, ruthless, sleazy and has his life complicated by the fact he is sleeping (in, of course, a transactional fashion) with the Prime Minister’s private secretary.

These factors are expected to shape up the future of the social media analytics market.

O Tribunal Regional Eleitoral de São Paulo (TRE-SP) indeferiu a candidatura de Filipe Sabará à Prefeitura de São Paulo. Expulso do Partido Novo por inconsistências no currículo e na declaração de patrimônio, Sabará teve a candidatura indeferida neste domingo, 25, após a Justiça acatar o pedido movido pelo partido.
 No sábado, 24, o Novo apresentou um ofício para confirmar a renúncia da candidata à vice na chapa de Sabará, a economista Maria Helena. No mesmo documento, o partido informa que não vai indicar um novo candidato a vice, solicitando a exclusão da chapa do processo eleitoral.
 "Embora ainda no período previsto para substituição de candidatos, o Diretório Municipal de São Paulo deliberou pela não substituição, com a consequente extinção dos pedidos de registro, em cumprimento a todas as normas de regência", diz um trecho do pedido movido pelo Novo.
 Apesar do indeferimento da candidatura, a propaganda de Sabará no horário eleitoral gratuito foi ao ar normalmente no rádio na manhã desta segunda- feira, 26.
 A candidatura de Sabará foi marcada por atritos com o partido que o lançou, o Novo. O candidato chegou a ser impedido pela sigla de fazer campanha, em setembro. O processo de desgaste entre o candidato e o partido culminou com a sua expulsão na última quarta-feira, 21, após decisão da Comissão de Ética. A expulsão de Sabará ocorreu horas depois do candidato criticar a cúpula do partido, durante sabatina do _Estadão_.

Villains are staples of stories for kids. Making them bigger, meaner, madder, more impossible to defeat — that's how you build the ideas of fear and then, inevitably, of courage. A small person faces a giant, or a witch, or a wolf, or Jafar, or Cruella De Vil, or the Buy 'N' Large, and by watching that happen, you learn. You learn what it takes to beat the bad guy. You learn that you, too, can beat the bad guy. You learn not to lose heart and not to give up. You use something inside yourself to beat something outside yourself.

Standards at donation centers vary greatly, with the community’s average income often determining the facility’s overall aesthetic appeal – the lower the average income, the fewer bells and whistles. Facilities in the most impoverished areas often lack even proper seating or sometimes offer no seating at all, forcing donors to squat or crouch on the floor while they donate. Calls have been made for more state or federal regulations to force centers to offer a comfortable, equitable donating experience for everyone in every neighborhood.

Although Greenfield does not support a Medicare-for-all program like the ones proposed by U.S. Sens. and former Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Ernst argues Greenfield's support for the addition of a public health insurance option hastens a slippery slope to Medicare-for-all.

“It isn’t just old presentations or PowerPoints. We are hiring a professional broadcaster from the studio to help us,” said Abbey Wick, NDSU Extension soil health specialist. “We’re excited about it.”
 Tim Hammerich, host of the Soil Sense podcast, will fly in to the event in Fargo, and join Wick in hosting the event.
 Wick wants the workshop to be creative and one that “grabs your attention,” so there are some plans that she is not disclosing right now.
 They are still in the planning phase right now, but Wick said there will be videos from different farmers talking about their operations that were collected this fall.
 “There will be panel of farmers presented on a 20-foot screen,” she said, noting that people watching can participate in the workshop by asking questions in the chat box.
 Wick also wants to have “virtual hallways” at Extension offices that will lead to discussions.
 “We will recreate what happens when farmers stop in at their local Extension office and talk with their Extension agents,” Wick said.
 In addition, she is hosting soil health experts from other states speaking on what is working with soil health in their states.
 “All the data is North Dakota specific to certain parts of the state,” she said. “Farmers will be able to hear from others in surrounding states and adjust the information – tweak it to fit their own operations.”
 Some of the subjects that may be addressed at the DIRT workshop will include changing to conservation tillage, cover crops for soil health and grazing, water management with cover crops, and more.

Nearly 80% of donation centers in the U.S. are strategically located in low-income areas, home to people barely able – or unable – to make ends meet. Critics have claimed that the companies purposefully open facilities in such areas under the assumption that desperate people are much more likely to regularly go under the needle to supplement their income than those who are more financially secure.

London [UK], October 26 (ANI): After stumbling to a 0-1 defeat at the hands of Leicester City in the Premier League, Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta admitted that fatigue had a role to play in the defeat of his side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Arsenal and Leicester City were even at 0-0 till the 80th minute of the match. At that time, Jamie Vardy scored the match-winning goal for Leicester City, giving them a 1-0 win.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "I think fatigue had a say there as well. We didn't look as sharp on the ball. We didn't have much purpose on the ball. David gave us something different when we wanted to do something with the low blocks," Goal.com quoted Arteta as saying.

It's an aspect we have to improve on," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Arteta also said he was pleased to see how his side performed in the first half. However, the coach said the side was hampered by the lack of continuity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "To be fair I was really pleased with the first half. The way we pressed and the aggression we showed. We were effective with that and restricted them to nothing. We scored the goal on the set-piece, which I don't know how it got disallowed. We needed to be patient and not to make any errors," Arteta said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "We made the decision when there is no pressure on the ball to try and attack that space and they scored a good goal. We didn't manage to have enough continuity in our play, we didn't put the ball as often as we could in the box. It's a very harsh result for us considering what happened in the game," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Arsenal is currently at the 10th position in the Premier League 2020-21 standings with 9 points from six games.

We have to err on the side of conservative, said Paul Hepfer, chief executive of Project Open Hand, which has been delivering meals to thousands of older adults around the Bay Area but has no plans to resume in-person dining.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan said Monday it will not sign a U.N. treaty that bans nuclear weapons and does not welcome its entry into force next year, rejecting the wishes of atomic bomb survivors in Japan who are urging the government to join and work for a nuclear-free world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The United Nations confirmed Saturday that 50 countries have ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, paving the way for its entry into force in 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The announcement was hailed by anti-nuclear activists, but the treaty has been strongly opposed by the United States and other major nuclear powers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan shares the goal of achieving a nuclear-free world, but does not think the treaty is the way to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “Japan's approach is different from that of the treaty, and there is no change to our position not to sign it, as we have said,” Kato told reporters Monday. “We doubt if support is growing even among non-nuclear weapons states, let alone nuclear weapons states."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Japan has said that it is not realistic to pursue the treaty with nuclear powers and non-nuclear weapons states sharply divided over it. Kato said Japan has chosen instead to serve as a bridge to narrow the gap between the two sides.

Not only were Washington fans thrilled to find out that their team would be drafting DE Chase Young with the No. 2 overall pick because he was a generational talent that could take their defense to the next level.

The JAK-12 is the latest shotgun to be added into Modern Warfare and Warzone's shared roster of weapons, and it has the potential to wipe out squads in the blink of an eye if you get close enough. Key to this automatic shotgun, as with all shotguns in Warzone, is to mazimise both its effective range and its magazine capacity, to help deal with the larger health pools of armoured Warzone players.

The powerful FiNN LMG in its current state is ludicrously powerful, and with our loadout you can bump it all the way into overpowered. Key to our setup is the LongShot Adverse barrel, which gives you the extreme fire rate of the Adverse but without sacrificing any range - particularly when combined with the ever-popular Monolithic Suppressor. The Commando Foregrip gives us even greater control for nailing those long-range shots, while the Tac Laser and Sleight of Hand perk speed up the gun's low points into acceptable territory.

Over the preceding forty-five of those ninety days, there had been times when I felt like giving up. There had been entire days when I felt like relinquishing him to Nancy [Archie's mistress] and losing myself in my writing, my family, and my daughter. _Would it really be so terrible?_ I asked myself. After all, if I were honest with myself, our marriage had been empty for some time; golf seemed to play a more robust role in Archie's life than I did. Yet when I thought about Rosalind [the Christies' daughter], I knew I had to stay the course. I couldn't let the stain of divorce taint my beautiful daughter and strain our relationship.
