The massive stimulus bill to support individuals and businesses devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic is tribute to that rarest of Washington creatures these days — bipartisanship.
 Both Republicans and Democrats wrote the $2 trillion economic relief package, which President Donald Trump signed on Friday. True to form, he did not invite one Democrat to the signing, but considering that all of us are supposed to stay six feet apart and in small groups, that’s just as well.
 This is an example of how members of Congress from different parties, philosophies and parts of the country can work together for the good of the American people despite concerns over the final package.
 Republicans object to parts of it. Democrats object to parts of it. That’s the nature of compromise. Everyone gave up something.
 For Americans hurting because their jobs vanished overnight, there will be direct, immediate relief. A check for $1,200 for most adults and $500 for children will be in the mail (or direct deposit, for those signed up for that service with the Internal Revenue Service). While that is not enough to make up an entire month’s wages for most, having money to spend right away will go a long way to soothing people’s fears and toward putting food on the table.
 The legislation offers zero-interest loans for small businesses, expands unemployment benefits — Democrats demanded that freelance and gig workers be included — and provides tax breaks and other emergency aid. For states, there will be $150 billion in additional federal funding to fight the outbreak and another $100 billion for hospitals and healthcare facilities.
 It is not perfect.
 For progressives, there is too much assistance for big business and corporations.
 For conservatives, there is concern that too-generous unemployment benefits will be an incentive for people to stay home and an expansion of the safety net so many want to destroy.
 Too often in recent years, such concerns would bring the legislative process to a grinding halt. All or nothing, has been the guiding principle of too many lawmakers. Not this time. The Senate voted 96-0 to pass the stimulus on Wednesday, and the House followed suit on Friday.
 The process was far from easy despite the magnitude of the crisis, with hard negotiations between the parties stalling progress early on and a House member threatening to gum up the works toward the end with demands for an in-person, roll-call vote despite some members already being home. Leaders wanted a voice vote, which just includes those present, and they ultimately prevailed.
 It was encouraging, too, to see members of GOP Rep. Thomas Massie’s own party stop his grandstanding move to demand all members of Congress be present. More country over party, please, as the nation moves forward in these troubled times. The House and Senate both are going to have to find a way to govern — perhaps using technology — at a time when gatherings of more than 10 people are discouraged for fear of spreading the virus.
 This might be the largest stimulus package in modern times, but the damage to the economy is deep and likely to become worse. More economic support will be needed. The federal government has failed so far in attempts to stem the pandemic, a failure of leadership the likes of which the U.S. hasn’t seen in decades.
 But for one moment, Congress did what it was supposed to do. Its members put aside partisanship and passed legislation to support the people of the United States. The nation needs more such bipartisanship in the tough days to come.

 They made a few changes, and some were back in business. Poppy Hills in Pebble Beach, which initially closed, announced, “Open for play with limitations,” Golf Digest reported.
 Similar reversals have happened in other states, most recently in Illinois, after state stay-at-home orders initially forced golf courses to close.
 But golf courses remain shut down in many states, including Wisconsin after Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order that runs until April 24.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo emphasized the importance of “partnership” over “partisanship” in his daily news briefing Monday, announcing 253 more deaths of the novel coronavirus in the state since Sunday as health-care workers continue to brace for an apex that experts believe is still weeks away.
 There are 66,496 confirmed cases in New York and a total of 1,218 deaths. Nearly 10,000 people are hospitalized, Cuomo said, and more than 4,000 have been discharged.
 The governor, a Democrat, said there’s “no doubt the rate has slowed,” but daily intubation is “way up.”
 “The situation is painfully clear now,” Cuomo said. “There’s no question [as to] what we’re dealing with. There’s no question as to the consequences. There’s no question to the grief and loss of life. And there’s no question to what we must do.”
 Cuomo reiterated a mandate he has been repeating for weeks: “Stay at home.”
 “I don’t know how many different ways to make the same point,” he said, threatening to close New York City’s playgrounds if residents don’t take social distancing seriously.
 The governor said the “soldiers in this fight are our health-care professionals.” He made a desperate plea for help to health-care professionals across the country. “If you don’t have a health-care crisis in your community, please come help New York now,” Cuomo said. “We will return the favor.”
 Reporters at the briefing asked Cuomo to address President Donald Trump’s remarks at Sunday’s White House briefing, asserting something sinister is happening with personal protective equipment.
 “I don’t know what that means, I don’t know what he’s trying to say,” Cuomo said. “If he wants to make an accusation, let him make an accusation.”
 The governor emphasized a message of unity, but added he was not afraid to “tangle” with Trump when necessary.
 “I am not engaging the president in politics,” Cuomo said. “My only goal is to engage the president in partnership. This is no time for politics. You know, lead by example.”
 Also Monday, California hospitalizations have doubled in the past four days, and the state’s intensive care unit load has tripled, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.
 There are 597 ICU patients and 1,432 hospitalized statewide. The state has about 5,800 coronavirus cases, Newsom said in a news conference.
 To respond to the surge in hospitalizations, Newsom announced that the state was creating a new “California health corps” as a way of recruiting medical students and retired doctors for the front line.
 The state estimates that about 37,000 people fall under the categories of medical professional retirees, those seeking new licenses and medical and nursing students. Newsom said he is hoping “thousands” will heed the call.
 “If you know people that you think are willing to contribute their time and energy in a compensated way to go, tell them to go to this new website so we can meet the health-care surge,” Newsom said of a newly launched website to enlist health-care workers.
 Newsom also signed an executive order to allow health-care facilities to staff at least an additional 50,000 hospital beds.
 Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will provide $25 million in stipends if staffers need accommodations for such things as transportation and child care, Newsom said.
 Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., discussed Democrats’ plans for a Phase 4 coronavirus measure during a conference call with reporters.
 Pelosi said the legislation will include a focus on infrastructure, Occupational Safety and Health Administration protections for front-line workers and funding for the District of Columbia, among other things.

Notwithstanding the high efficiency and market versatility of these stapling devices, they are prone to inadequate use if they are plagued by technical errors. In recent years, there have reported incidences of staple line leaks causing unstable anastomosis, leading to various postoperative complications. The incidence of staple leaks may be on account of the knowledge gap surgeons have over the tissue handling characteristics of these stapling devices. This calls for timely and regular research programs collaborated by educational programs to fill this gap. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve the optimal usage of surgical stapling devices in the medical practice. This will be underpinned by concerted efforts by surgeons and medical device makers to develop a robust foundational framework.

The global diamond wire market is primarily driven by increase in the demand for these wires in various construction and electronics applications. Diamond- wired cutting tools have high cutting efficiency than the traditional cutting slurry saws. They can provide highly consistent cuts over the period of time. Usage of diamond wires in cutting tools is an eco-friendly process, generating minimum residual waste. Transition from the traditional wire cutting process toward diamond wire cutting process is anticipated to drive the diamond wire market during the forecast period. Furthermore, utilization of diamond-wired cutting tools reduces the time required for silicon wafer manufacturing, resulting in the reduction of cost per wafer. Increase in the production of silicon wafers led by the rising demand for photovoltaic and semiconductor applications is projected to boost the adoption of diamond wires in the next few years. Advancements in the technology for cutting of diamond wires are projected to increase productivity and overall efficiency of diamond wires during the forecast period, thereby creating lucrative growth opportunities for the global diamond wire market.

As indies in the 2020s, yes, it's true that our situation is different from that of Nintendo in the 1980s, so the point is not necessarily to make 4 games in 3 years, but to plan on working your way up through steady and consistent releases rather than one long and self-destructive longshot. To use a baseball analogy, start by trying to get on base and not by trying to hit home runs. If you get good enough at hitting the ball consistently, the chances of you hitting a home run go up tremendously. There are plenty of examples of this in the modern indie space, as well. For me, personally, I feel like it was essential to release the first Spelunky game, Spelunky Classic, as a freeware title with simple pixel graphics. Had I attempted to go straight for Spelunky 2 (my current project), I have to believe the road would have been many times more challenging, stressful, and uncertain.

ELIOT, Maine - The Select Board canceled the annual Citizens' Option meeting, scheduled for March 30.
   
 Richard Donhauser, Robert McPherson, Alex Orestis and Phil Lytle, unanimously canceled the meeting. The fifth seat on the board is currently vacant.
   
 "After considering the potential threat of individuals contracting the COVID-19 virus and concern for town of Eliot citizens, town staff, committee and board members I felt compelled to cancel the scheduled Citizens' Option meeting," Donhauser said.
   
 Budgets are voted on by referendum on the town meeting election ballot. To provide voter input on the budget, a Citizens' Option meeting is held after the Select Board and Budget Committee make their recommendations on budget items.
   
 For each budget referendum item on the June ballot, the Select Board recommends an appropriation, and the Budget Committee can support that recommendation or make its own. At the Citizens' Option meeting, voters may recommend a third amount. Each question can therefore have four voting options: the amount recommended by the Select Board, the amount recommended by the Budget Committee, the Citizens' Option recommendation or "none."
   
 The meeting is usually held at Marshwood Middle School, because to make a recommendation a quorum must be present, which is 1% of the number of registered voters, or 62, according to Town Clerk Wendy Rawski. If the quorum is not met, the meeting becomes a public hearing on the budget.
   
 Because of the COVID-19 crisis, the meeting's location was moved to the Town Hall meeting room, which can hold no more than 25 people. Town Manager Dana K. Lee had urged voters to not attend the meeting but to watch it through video streaming and call in their questions.
   
 The Select Board canceled the meeting Saturday, March 28.
   
 Generally, only one or two recommendations are made at the Citizens' Option meeting. The library appropriation is a favorite. In past years, the library request was reduced by the Select Board and/or the Budget Committee. The Citizens' Option meeting has recommended the requested amount.
   
 This year, the town foresaw little citizen support for changes in the budgets. The Select Board supported the library's request this year. The Budget Committee did not recommend a pay raise for the town manager that was recommended by the Select Board.
   
 Lee said the town has a $6 million-plus budget with $3 million-plus in non-tax revenues. He said last week the budget was under the LD1 formula maximum of a $38,000 increase in property taxes.
   
 The LD1 limit on increasing property taxes each year is imposed on towns by the state with the promise of the state to fund 55% of the cost of education. Lee often points out the state does not fulfill its pledge for education funding.
   
 Town Hall remains closed to the public through April 7. Staff can be contacted through www.eliotmaine.org or (207) 439-1817. There are no public meetings scheduled. Lee said Town Election is still scheduled for June 9.
   
 Nomination papers are available for Selectmen and Overseer of the Poor, two members, terms to June 2023, and one member, term to June 2022; Budget Committee, two members, terms to June 2023; and SAD 35 directors, one member, term to June 2023, and one member, term to June 2022. Nominees must be a registered voter of Eliot. Nomination papers require at least 25 but not more than 100 signatures of Eliot registered voters. Call the town clerk's office at (207) 439-1817 to arrange the issuance or return of nomination papers. Completed papers must be filed with the town clerk by 1 p.m. April 10.
   
 Eliot announced the closure of the town's basketball and tennis courts.
   
 An "Eliot Strong" group was created on Facebook offering information and help through the Eliot Strong Community Helpers. Those not using Facebook may contact the group through state Rep. Michele Meyer at michelevmeyer@gmail.com or (207) 438 9197.

"For most people, it's a fairly safe scenario. If you're not showing signs and have been taking precautions like all of us have, I don't think it's something to stop the entire world from competing or anything else especially when they're gonna take precautions like not having fans," said Faber.
 Outside of MMA and a burgeoning film career, Faber is also starting an online university shortly and he talked more about that.
 "I've had a private site up just for access for my guys for years. It has proprietary sequences for mixed martial arts stuff and we've put together around 400 videos. Especially with this coronavirus hitting and everyone sitting at home, I feel like it's kinda the time," stated Faber. "If you look at the landscape of the history of Alpha Male fighters over 14 years, we've got champions all over the place."
 Faber then talked about many of the fighters currently in Team Alpha Male or ones that have passed through and moved onto other things.
 "All these guys have touched our team and I've never really put it out there for the public to learn the system of what I think is the important aspects of the fight game. I'm putting that out now and it should be out in a month or so. It will be virtual training with different levels and have the motivational side, the technical side and a lot of different things," revealed Faber.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration rolled backed ambitious Obama-era vehicle mileage standards Tuesday, raising the ceiling on damaging fossil fuel emissions for years to come and gutting one of the United States' biggest efforts against climate change.
   
 The Trump administration released a final rule Tuesday on mileage standards through 2026. The change -- after two years of Trump threatening and fighting states and a faction of automakers that opposed the move -- waters down a tough Obama mileage standard that would have encouraged automakers to ramp up production of electric vehicles and more fuel-efficient gas and diesel vehicles.
   
 "We are delivering on President Trump's promise to correct the current fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards," Andrew Wheeler, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement Tuesday marking the release.
   
 He said the final rule "puts in place a sensible" national program that "strikes the right regulatory balance that protects our environment, and sets reasonable targets for the auto industry. This rule supports our economy, and the safety of American families."
   
 Opponents contend the change -- gutting his predecessor's legacy effort against climate-changing fossil fuel emissions -- appears driven by Trump's push to undo regulatory initiatives of former President Barack Obama and say even the administration has had difficulty pointing to the kind of specific, demonstrable benefits to drivers, public health and safety or the economy that normally accompany standards changes.
   
 The Trump administration says the looser mileage standards will allow consumers to keep buying the less fuel-efficient SUVs that U.S. drivers have favored for years. Opponents say it will kill several hundred more Americans a year through dirtier air, compared to the Obama standards.
   
 Even "given the catastrophe they're in with the coronavirus, they're pursuing a policy that's going to hurt public health and kill people," said Chet France, a former 39-year veteran of the EPA, where he served as a senior official over emissions and mileage standards.
   
 "This is first time that an administration has pursued a policy that will net negative benefit for society and reduce fuel savings," France said.
   
 Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, called it "the height of irresponsibility for this administration to finalize a rollback that will lead to dirtier air while our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution.
   
 In Phoenix, meanwhile, resident Columba Sainz expressed disappointment at the prospect of losing the Obama-era rule, which she had hoped would allow her preschool age children to break away from TV indoors and play outside more. Sainz reluctantly limited her daughter to a half-hour at the park daily, after the girl developed asthma, at age 3, at their home a few minutes from a freeway.
   
 "I cried so many times," Sainz said. "How do you tell your daughter she can't be outside because of air pollution?"
   
 Trump's Cabinet heads have continued a push to roll back public health and environment regulations despite the coronavirus outbreak riveting the world's attention. The administration -- like others before it -- is facing procedural rules that will make changes adopted before the last six months of Trump's current term tougher to throw out, even if the White House changes occupants.
   
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has been the main agency drawing up the new rules, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
   
 Earlier drafts of the mileage rollback have shown the administration struggling to justify relaxing the mileage standards. Trump officials contend vehicles will be cheaper for Americans to buy, because automakers will have saved on emissions-cutting technology. Former EPA emissions officials say the cost of more fuel, and costs like increased healthcare bills from the extra pollution, cancel out any sticker savings.
   
 The standards have split the auto industry with Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen siding with California and agreeing to higher standards. Most other automakers contend the Obama-era standards were enacted hastily and will be impossible to meet because consumers have shifted dramatically away from efficient cars to SUVs and trucks.
   
 California and about a dozen other states say they will continue resisting the Trump standards in court.
   
 Last year, 72% of the new vehicles purchased by U.S. consumers were trucks or SUVS. It was 51% when the current standards went into effect in 2012.
   
 The Obama administration mandated 5% annual increases in fuel economy. Leaked versions of the Trump administration's latest proposal show a 1.5% annual increase, backing off from its initial proposal simply to stop mandating increases in fuel efficiency after 2020.
   
 The transportation sector is the nation's largest source of climate-changing emissions.
   
 John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing automakers, said the industry still wants middle ground between the two standards, and it supports year-over-year mileage increases. But he says the Obama-era standards are outdated due to the drastic shift to trucks and SUVs.
   
 The Trump administration standards are likely to cause havoc in the auto industry because, with legal challenges expected, automakers won't know which standards they will have to obey.
   
 "It will be extraordinarily disruptive," said Richard J. Pierce Jr., a law professor at the George Washington University who specializes in government regulations.
   
 States and environmental groups will challenge the Trump rules, and a U.S. District Court likely will issue a temporary order shelving them until it decides whether they are legal. The temporary order likely will be challenged with the Supreme Court, which in recent cases has voted 5-4 that a District judge can't issue such a nationwide order, Pierce said. But the nation's highest court could also keep the order in effect if it determines the groups challenging the Trump standards are likely to win.
   
 "We're talking quite a long time, one to three years anyway, before we can expect to get a final decision on the merits," Pierce said.

The concept has been used for every sort of topic, from sexual assault and domestic violence to health organizations and issues to local government actions.
 For the Thomas Jefferson Health District, the increasing government response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases led to the need for an information line that clients and the general public could call to get answers.
 “We try to put as much information out there as we can, and a lot of it goes online, but not everyone is online or has access to computers,” Elliott said. “When there’s a lot of information, it’s easy to get lost trying to figure it out.”
 The department line is not staffed by medical personnel, however. Those who answer the phone do not offer medical advice. They can give advice on topics from testing locations to social restrictions, however.
 “We’ve gotten a wide range of calls from folks who are wanting to know where to get tested or what the symptoms are and how it’s transmitted, to people who call and say, ‘I need to know what resources are available’ and ask about financial resources,” he said.
 “We’re not a medical hotline, so if folks are worried about symptoms or testing, we refer them either to their primary care physician or other medical resources,” Elliott said. “The one thing we tell them if they want to get tested or see a doctor is to call first. Make sure to call and make arrangements so they don’t show up and have to wait or be turned away.”
 Elliott said the hotline will be up and running as long as people are using it.
 “As long as we need it, we’ll keep it going,” he said.

 Earlier Monday, the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency approval to a Trump administration plan to distribute millions of doses of anti- malarial drugs to hospitals across the country, saying it is worth the risk of trying unproven treatments to slow the disease in seriously ill coronavirus patients.
 There have only been a few, very small anecdotal studies that show a possible benefit of the drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, to relieve the acute respiratory symptoms of covid-19 and clear the virus from infected patients.
 And health experts warned the drugs’ well-known side effects could become more commonplace with much wider use. In particular, they say, patients with existing heart problems or taking certain drugs such as anti-depressants that affect heart rhythm are at risk of a fatal episode.
 In Louisiana, on the three-week anniversary of the’s first coronavirus case, which was March 9, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced that the number of infections in the state rose by 485 in the past 24 hours to 4,025 as of noon Monday, and deaths climbed by 34 to 185.
 New Orleans remained the epicenter in the state, with 1,480 total cases and 86 deaths.
 Edwards, a Democrat, said that earlier Monday, he participated with other governors in a videoconference with President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the coronavirus task force. Trump “acknowledged our need for ventilators, and made a commitment that they will send ventilators to Louisiana,” Edwards said. However the president did not specify a number nor offer a timeline for delivery, he added.
 Ventilators remain the state’s “most pressing need” as the virus threatens to overwhelm the state’s medical capacity, according to Edwards. Despite having ordered 14,000 ventilators from federal and private sources in the last several days, the state has received fewer than 200. Under current trends of infections and hospitalizations, the state could run out of ventilators in the New Orleans region by April 5 and hospital beds by April 12.
 Edwards said he thanked Trump for extending the recommendation for social distancing through April 30 and said he intended to extend the state’s deadline of April 12 to April 30 as well.
 In Italy, an additional 812 people have died, officials there said, bringing the country’s total number of deaths linked to the outbreak to 11,591.
 Monday’s death toll was up slightly from Sunday, when 756 people were confirmed dead, but down from Friday, when Italy recorded 919 deaths, the highest daily death toll of any country since the outbreak was first recorded in China late last year.
 An additional 1,648 people in Italy were diagnosed with the coronavirus, officials said Monday, bringing the country’s total number of confirmed cases to 101,739. That’s down from 3,815 new cases Sunday.
 In a glimmer of hope for the country, Angelo Borrelli, who is leading Italy’s coronavirus response, told reporters that Italy had determined that an additional 1,590 had recovered from the virus, the highest number of recoveries since the first case was recorded in February.
 Experts have predicted that the number of new cases will slow dramatically because of the country’s intense restrictions on movement that have confined most people to their homes.
 On Monday night, the Italy’s health minister announced in a short statement that the country was extending its lockdown until “at least” Easter.
 The extension comes as little surprise to Italians, who have been bracing for a lengthy interruption. Virologists have indicated that Italy will most likely need to restrict movement for months to contain the virus. Last week, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he was “confident” that Italy could go back to some version of daily life before the end of July.
 When Conte first announced the nationwide lockdown March 10, the measures were set in place through April 3.

The cancellation of multiple sports events related to the coronavirus pandemic could wind up costing the Texas Tech athletic department about $3.4 million.
   
 That's based on early projections and assuming the 2020 college football season is played as scheduled in front of normal crowds, said Jonathan Botros, a Tech senior associate athletic director and the department's chief financial officer.
   
 The $3.4 million is less than 4% of Tech's annual outlay for sports, based on the current fiscal year budget of $93.6 million, but Botros said it's a bigger blow than that might seem.
   
 "It may be small percentagewise, but I think it's still substantial," he said. "Our goal every single year, when we start with all the revenues that we receive, we try to plow all those back into the student-athlete experience and investing in the fan experience.
   
 "It's not our mission, as with any other higher education institution, to maintain a large amount of reserves, or profits, if you will. And so for that reason it's substantial, because we don't have additional revenues to offset that amount. So we would have to start looking at expense budget cuts and/or using reserves to cover it."
   
 The $3.4 million in losses stems from multiple areas, including reduced payouts from the NCAA basketball fund and a share of unrealized ticket sales from the Big 12 basketball tournaments that ended early.
   
 On campus, it includes refunds owed to Tech baseball and softball fans, the loss of gate and concessions revenue in those sports and the loss of food and beverage rent from the Texas Tech Club, which is closing temporarily under the public health disaster declaration.
   
 If all of Tech's seniors in spring sports who could benefit from extra NCAA eligibility return next year, Tech would pick up the tab for an extra $550,000 in scholarships.
   
 Many of Tech's best teams won't get to see how they stack up within the Big 12 and NCAA postseason competition this year, but the cancellation of the remaining spring sports season in response to the pandemic could save the athletic department money in the short term.
   
 Tech is looking at about a $700,000 loss for the rest of the fiscal year from games being canceled but figures to save $1.5 million to $2 million with its teams incurring no more travel costs.
   
 "What that does," Botros said, "is it allows us to hopefully put some of that in reserves to offset the loss that we know we're going to realize, whether it's next year, whether it's split up over the next couple of years, whenever that may be."
   
 All eight of Tech's spring sports teams -- four men's, four women's -- made NCAA postseason play last year. That doesn't include men's basketball, classified as a winter sport, making its run to the championship game of last year's NCAA Tournament.
   
 When their seasons ended prematurely this year, six of Tech's eight spring teams had top-25 national rankings again, with a seventh receiving votes.
   
 Botros emphasized that the savings projection of $1.5 million to $2 million is an estimate, with numbers still being run.
   
 "A lot of that is because in recent years we have increased the budget substantially for postseason travel," he said. "Traveling in the postseason is very expensive. So when you're making deep runs into the NCAA Tournament, when you're making runs to the College World Series each year, you're sending a lot of track and field athletes to nationals ... all these teams, although it's everything we want it to be and everything that we're striving for, it's also very expensive to do so.
   
 "So although we hate that we're not in the postseason this spring, at the same time it will allow us to offset quite a bit of this financial hit by not having those travel expenses."
   
 The shutdown left Tech athletics owing its baseball fans $398,000 worth of refunds on suites, annual seat contributions, season tickets and parking at Dan Law Field/Rip Griffin Park. Botros said a number of fans declined their refunds, instead donating them to the Red Raider Club Excellence Fund in amounts totaling $76,000.
   
 "That was pretty incredible," he said, "and it will absolutely help us offset this huge financial impact that we're looking at here in the next year."
   
 With the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, the NCAA Board of Governors voted Thursday to reduce its annual distribution to Division I members to $225 million from what was originally projected to be nearly $600 million. Those distributions will be made in June.
   
 Botros said that announcement saved Tech $900,000 compared with his worst-case scenario.
   
 "That was something we were concerned about," he said, "is how they would approach that and whether they would be doing an additional distribution this year. Just finding out they would be giving ($225) million to the conferences, we knew that would pass through to us and help us offset it."
   
 Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said the decreased payout means the conference will receive about $10 million instead of $24 million. For Tech, that means a reduction from about $2.4 million to $900,000, Botros said.
   
 "So what that tells me is we're going to lose, one way or another, about $1.5 million there somehow -- unless," Botros said. "That, of course, is money that funnels through the Big 12 Conference, so they still have the opportunity to offset that somehow."
   
 The annual Big 12 revenue distribution related to television contracts has increased 13 years in a row and was $38.8 million per school last year. Bowlsby said any shortfall this school year is likely to be made up by Big 12 reserves and money withheld last year for other purposes.
   
 Big 12 presidents still have to approve such a move.
   
 The cancellation of the Big 12 basketball tournaments cost the conference $6.6 million, Bowlsby said, and Tech is out $660,000 of that amount, Botros said.
   
 Botros said it has not been determined whether Tech will absorb that loss next year or over a multiyear period.
   
 "Really, for us right now, we feel like this is a storm that we can weather in the short term," he said. "Like everybody's been talking about nationally, the big impact is going to be if it affects football. Affecting football really changes everything from a financial standpoint."
   
 Bowlsby said Thursday that even if the coronavirus outbreak subsides relatively soon, he worries it could return to cause more disruption in the fall and winter. He talked about the possibility of the college football season being shortened, scrapped entirely or played in empty stadiums.
   
 Of Tech's current $93.6 million athletic budget, about 76% of the revenue comes from football, Botros said. As is the case on many campuses with Power Five conference and FBS programs, revenue from football covers costs for many other sports teams that typically operate at a net loss.
   
 One cost-saving measure Tech has enacted is limiting overtime opportunities for hourly wage employees. A lot of their duties revolve around sports events going on.
   
 "So without those happening, we have suspended any opportunity for overtime for the foreseeable future," Botros said. "So that's certainly an impact to some of our hourly employees by not being able to get overtime pay.
   
 "But we are making them whole 100% on their normal workweek. So if you had an employee that we only had enough work for them to do from home for maybe five hours, we are allowing them to claim what the university is calling non- working pandemic leave for the remaining 35 hours so that they still get their full paycheck for 40 hours."
   
 In addition to disrupting the sports teams, the shutdown comes at a time when Tech is trying to plan budgets for fiscal year 2021, which will begin Sept. 1.
   
 Botros said he's hoping for more clarity on the football landscape, "because I feel like within two weeks we need to hand our budgets over to our sports and our units to input information, and we hand that over to university officials toward the end of May.
   
 "Are we going to have to cut budgets for FY '21? How are we going to cut budgets for FY '21? In what areas? That's why I'm hoping to get additional information on how much revenue we may be in for losing for FY '21 in the next two weeks."

Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy announced 550 non-playing staff at the club will see their wages cut by 20 percent for the next two months on the same day it was revealed he was paid 7 million pounds ($8.7 million) last season. Spurs accounts to June 30, 2019 revealed Levy was paid a 3 million pound bonus, which was due on completion of Tottenham's new 62,000 stadium, on top of his 4 million pound salary.
 The new Tottenham Hotspur stadium opened in April last year, eight months later than scheduled and well over budget at a cost of 1 billion pound.
 Levy is among the staff members taking a 20 percent wage cut, but called on Tottenham's players to also do so to ease the financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Players at Barcelona, Juventus and Bayern Munich are among those to have taken either a significant wage cut or deferred payments.
 Football in England is suspended until at least April 30 and a meeting of Premier League clubs on Friday is expected to push that date further back.
 "Having already taken steps to reduce costs, we ourselves made the difficult decision, in order to protect jobs, to reduce the remuneration of all 550 non- playing directors and employees for April and May by 20 percent," Levy said in a statement on the Spurs website.
 "We hope the current discussions between the Premier League, PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) and LMA (League Managers Association) will result in players and coaches doing their bit for the football eco system."
 Tottenham earlier this month posted profits of 6 million pound for the year to June 2019 on the back of a run to the Champions League final and the stadium move.
 However, Levy said those numbers bore little relevance, with the club facing a difficult period and uncertainty among sponsors and media partners.
 "When I read or hear stories about player transfers this summer like nothing has happened, people need to wake up to the enormity of what is happening around us," he added.
 "We maybe the eighth-largest Club in the world by revenue according to the Deloitte survey but all that historical data is totally irrelevant as this virus has no boundaries."
 Tottenham sit eighth in the Premier League table and would therefore miss out on the riches of Champions League football for the first time in five years next season if the league were to be curtailed as it stands.
 However, economic factors are behind the desire of Premier League clubs to finish the campaign, even if it means doing so behind closed doors.
 According to reports, the clubs would have to reimburse broadcasters to the tune of 762 million pounds if the season is not completed

One of the biggest strengths of indie devs is our freedom, which allows us to work in our own way, to make decisions swiftly, and to make bold choices that AAA studios might not be able to. It's the lone wolf approach versus the large army approach. Unfortunately, it also means that we can be free to spin our wheels with very little accountability.
