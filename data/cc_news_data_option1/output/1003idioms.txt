DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC, Gray News) -Police confirmed Tuesday morning that they have recovered an Iowa woman’s SUV that was stolen Saturday with her wedding dress inside.Kylee Howell’s car was a mess inside, she said, and many personal belongings were missing, including her daughter's car seat and book bag.However, the bride-to-be said her wedding dress was still inside and appeared to be intact. She had picked the dress up on Saturday. After the appointment, she parked her car at a friend’s house and went out to dinner with friends to celebrate. Not long after the group returned from dinner, Howell noticed her car was missing with her dress still inside.She said she was devastated but was being realistic that she may never see it again. That all changed Tuesday thanks to a few vigilant Davenport women.Dee Ahrens and her daughter Natalie Bowens said they noticed a SUV had been parked in their neighborhood for a few days. Late Monday night, they went to check on the license plate when they realized it was likely the one that belonged to Howell."I asked my daughter Natalie, ‘When you're going to Hy-Vee can you get the license plate?’ We need to check it out,” Ahrens said. “And she came in the house and said ‘Mom! It's the lady who had the wedding dress stolen.’” Bowens said they had heard Howell’s story on the news. They remembered details about the car from the interview, including the county where it had been and the Iowa Hawkeye decal in the back window. “I was like ‘Oh my God, that’s her car, that’s her car,’” Bowens said. “All I could think about was making sure that she found, you know, that’s her car and that she got her dress back.”The duo alerted police and reached out to Howell on Facebook to make sure she knew immediately. “I can't even explain how I feel. I just am so grateful,” Howell said. She said at first the news seemed too good to be true and she didn't want to get her hopes up until police confirmed it was her vehicle and that her belongings were inside."No matter what anybody told me I wasn't going to believe it until I saw it with my own eyes,” she said. It wasn’t until the SUV was pulled out of the garage that she started to believe. "I kind of took a minute to just breathe and to look at the vehicle before I took a look around. And I opened up the trunk and it just kind of fell out the back and I lost it. I started crying,” Howell said. Howell said she has been overwhelmed with emotion over the events the past few days, but above all, grateful for so many people who have reached out and offered to help. She said strangers even offered to donate their wedding dresses to her.“I'm thankful for this playing out the way that it did. I feel really blessed right now,” Howell said. Howell posted on Facebook, expressing her gratitude. "These past 4 days have been a whirlwind of emotions to say the least. You never expect something terrible to happen to you, but it really changed me on many levels, and I am thankful for this incredibly difficult situation because it has been able to raise a bit of awareness on the seriousness of car theft and how deeply it can change someone’s life,” she wrote in the post. She also shared she would be responsible for paying for the damage, including the fee to get her stolen car out of the tow yard.As for the wedding planning, that will continue, and Howell says more than anything she is thrilled to marry the love of her life in September."I have just had moments of just being overwhelmed because I feel so blessed, because there are so many people that are not able to have the same situation I have," she said.She is grateful to Ahrens and Bowen for looking out for her and helping reunite with her dream dress."It's karma. I hope something good for us comes along the way, but something good for came for her and that's all that's worth it,” Ahrens said. No suspects or arrests have been named in the case. Police said the car was unoccupied when it was recovered.Copyright 2020 KWQC via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

After the intermission, Thomson introduced “the meat and potatoes, or really tough tofu, I guess.”
 When she asked guest pianist Ian Parker what he wanted to perform, Parker paused “for a second-and-a-half” and said his favourite masterpiece: Brahms’ Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor.
 Composed in 1854-58, it was Brahms’ first three-movement concerto of any kind when it was transformed from a proposed sonata for two pianos into a four- movement symphony. Then it became a concerto and Brahms continued to make revisions after its premiere.
 Parker has performed with top Canadian and U.S. orchestras with this, his fourth appearance with the OSO. During his introduction, he noted “the big, big, beefiness of this piece with its thick romantic texture.”
 Described as “an enthusiastic recitalist,” Parker was exciting to watch as he hunched over the piano, shaking his head, nodding and swaying in time to the music.
 At times, his stiff fingers rapidly pounded the keys, shaking his hands by his sides after an intense flurry of notes. At other times, his hands slowly caressed the keys as if his fingers were making love to this beautiful melody.
 The key word in the introduction was a “conversation” between the piano and orchestra with both playing equal parts rather than the orchestra accompanying the pianist. Each fed off the other.
 In the final movement, Parker was off and running, bouncing up and down on the piano bench, his cheeks shaking, his head nodding to his flashing hands as if to encourage his fingers to move even faster.
 Sometimes, the notes took on the character of a waterfall. Then, it was like a team of jackhammers, right hand crossing over the left to hit the lower notes, both hands rising high into the air. It was dramatic. It was thrilling. And 500 in the audience jumped to their feet for a sustained standing ovation.

South Korea's response is not perfect. While more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others - an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. The rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-February, but the system's greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. South Korea does not have enough protective masks - it has started rationing them - and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases. And the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. South Korea's system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy. Unlike China and the island-state of Singapore, which have used similar methods, South Korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like.

The Western Wall Heritage Foundation reported on Thursday it will begin conducting special psalm readings and prayer services at Warren's Gate in the Western Wall tunnels.
 The gate used to lead to the section of the temple called 'The Holy of Holies' which, according to the Jewish faith, contained the presence of god. It is named in honor of one of the early archeologists of the Holy Land, Charles Warren. The late Rabbi Yehuda Getz thought this point is the closest to the original site of worship currently available to Jewish worshipers.
 The reciting of psalms is believed by some to be a means to beseech heaven for good health and such prayers are usually coupled with the mention of the name of the sick person for whom help is called for.
 Hundreds of names had been recited so far and, as of Thursday, a special prayer about the conduct of prayers in the temple called 'pitom haketoret' will also be recited. The prayer deals with how the incense was burnt as an offering in the temple of King Solomon.
 The prayer plaza is not a closed space so according to the current health regulations it is not risky to pray there.
 Two prayer tents will be built in time for the weekend services, each hosting 100 people, to ensure health regulations are carried out.
 Those who wish to send a name of a loved one to be prayed over can use this link.

Amid rise in novel coronavirus cases in India, the government on Thursday asked people not to panic, saying no community transmission of the virus has been observed and there has only been a few cases of local transmission so far. Asserting that the safety and welfare of its citizens abroad have always been a priority for India, the government said starting from Friday, three back-to-back evacuations will be made to bring back Indians from Iran.
 With novel coronavirus being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), health ministry officials said even though the virus is difficult to isolate, scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have been successful in finding about 11 isolates, but developing a vaccine will take at least one-and-a-half to two years. The number of COVID-19 patients in India has risen to 74, which includes 16 Italians and one Canadian. The figure also includes three patients from Kerala who were discharged last month following recovery.
 Lav Aggarwal, the Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry, said 1,500 people who came in contact with the 74 infected people were under rigorous observation while over 30,000 people across the country were under community surveillance. "India presently has around 1 lakh testing kits. More testing kits have been ordered and they are in procurement," he said.
 As far as transmission of the disease is concerned, Aggarwal said, "Luckily for India we do not have any community transmission. We only have a few cases that have come from outside and have primarily affected their close family members." The remark came days after the ministry, in an official statement, said cases of community transmission of the virus have been observed. About evacuation measures undertaken so far, Aggarwal said till now, India has evacuated 948 people from coronavirus-affected countries.
 Of these, 900 were Indians and 48 belonged to different nationalities including from the Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, the USA, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa and Peru, he said. A Civil Aviation Ministry official said starting from Friday, three back-to-back evacuations will be carried out to bring Indians back from Iran.
 "The first evacuation from Iran will take place tomorrow and around 200 people are expected to reach Mumbai airport around 12.30 pm. The second evacuation will be on March 15 and the flight will arrive at Delhi airport. "The third evacuation from Iran is likely to be on March 16 or 17," the official said, adding on Tuesday, 58 evacuees from Iran had arrived in India, which included 25 men, 31 women and two children all of whom are asymptomatic at present.
 Moreover, 83 evacuees from Italy who arrived in India on Wednesday have been housed at the Manesar quarantine facility. All patients in hospitals are being treated and reported to be stable, officials said. The health ministry said India has always prioritised the safety and welfare of its citizens abroad and mounted timely operations from February 1 to evacuate them from coronavirus- affected countries.
 Aggarwal said the government has made 52 laboratories functional for testing samples while 57 labs have been designated for helping in sample collection to enhance diagnosis and detection capacity of the disease. The focus is on preventive approach and adequate testing facilities have been made available, he said.
 Raman R Gangakhedkar, the head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I), division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said scientists at the NIV in Pune have been successful in isolating the virus strain. "Coronaviruses are difficult to isolate. But the efforts of the scientists of NIV Pune have been successful and about 11 isolates of coronavirus are available which is a prime requisite for doing any kind of research related to viruses. Even with expedited clinical trials and approvals, it will take not less than one-and-a-half-years to two years to develop a vaccine," he said.
 Officials said that India's efforts to deal with coronavirus are in consonance with WHO and the focus is on preventive approach. The government has stepped up vigil and following a strong contact tracing system to ensure anyone who has come in touch with the infected are not missed out. Till now, 11,14,025 people have been screened at 30 designated airports in India, they said. Asked whether high temperature kills coronavirus, officials said there was no study or evidence till now to suggest that.
 As the contagious disease with flu-like symptoms spread across the globe, the cabinet secretary on Wednesday said states and Union Territories should invoke provisions of section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, so that all advisories issued by the Union health ministry and state governments are enforceable. India has suspended all visas, except for a few categories such as diplomatic and employment, till April 15 in a bid to contain the spread of the respiratory virus, according to a revised travel advisory. The government also "strongly advised" Indians to avoid all non-essential travel abroad.
 Visa-free travel facility granted to Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) card holders is also kept in abeyance till April 15, according to the advisory issued on Wednesday. It said, any foreign national who intends to travel to India for compelling reason may contact the nearest Indian Mission and that all incoming travellers, including Indian nationals, arriving from or having visited China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after February 15 will be quarantined for a minimum 14 days..

Technical chart claims that Brinker International, Inc. (EAT) would settle between $24.07/share to $26.63/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $20.04 mark, then the market for Brinker International, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $18.57 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -6.51. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

NEW YORK -- People who live in the epicenter of New York's coronavirus outbreak said they were not convinced the state's order closing the area's schools and large-gathering venues for two weeks would do enough to curb the spread of infection.
 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo this week said he was heeding the advice of the state health commissioner by ordering a one-mile diametrical "containment zone" around an infection hotspot in New Rochelle, Westchester County, north of New York City.
 The mandate closes three public schools, several private and parochial schools, houses of worship and other large gathering venues in that area for two weeks starting Thursday.
 Still, some residents believe the zone is too narrow to limit the spread of the disease, which has infected at least 216 people in New York, including more than 120 in Westchester.
 Joy Malone, a photographer in New Rochelle whose children attend two of the three public schools that have been closed, said shutting just three of the city's 10 public schools made no sense.
 "There are children in all three who have siblings in the other seven," Malone said. "It's a huge mistake, especially with the severity of what is happening."
 More than 1,300 people in the United States have contracted the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus, and at least 38 have died, most of them in Washington state, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 The cluster of some 121 cases in Westchester County emerged after an attorney who lives in New Rochelle and works in Manhattan became the second person in New York to be diagnosed with the virus last week.
 Several cases in the city have been traced to the Young Israel Synagogue of New Rochelle, where the attorney attended services last month. The synagogue, which public health officials closed last week, is at the center of the containment zone.
 Health officials hoped the containment zone would prevent large gatherings of people and slow the spread of the illness, but the measure would not stop people's movement into and out of the area, New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said.
 In a phone interview with Reuters, Bramson said state and federal health officials decided the parameters of the zone with little input from city officials.
 "All of those factors were considered by the state, and they judged the containment zone to be a sensible way of proceeding," Bramson said.
 "For a locality like New Rochelle to independently freelance without the expertise to back up our local judgments I think would be a very serious mistake," he said.
 Governor Cuomo said he would deploy the National Guard during the period of containment to clean schools and other buildings and deliver food to those in need, including thousands of children who rely on school meals.
 Not every parent was displeased by the state's order.
 Denise Logan, who lives in the containment zone, said her children have so far enjoyed the novelty of completing their school work remotely.
 "I thought that closing the schools was going to be inevitable," she said. "It seems like a very good idea to me."
 Kelly Ann DeCola, a New Rochelle resident whose children's schools were not affected, did not want schools to close because she could not afford to skip work to care for her children at home.
 Regardless, DeCola said the decision to close only a few schools, and not all, was "astronomically illogical" because children from across the city congregate for various activities and may even spend more time together now without the confines of a school day, heightening the risk of the virus spreading.
 "Children from all over the city join together for basketball, soccer, karate, after-school programs, dancing school," DeCola said in a Facebook message. "Now we're going to have teenagers congregating in areas that they would have not been before."

WASHINGTON — A feared coronavirus has struck our world with a vengeance, including parts of the U.S., and plunged the stock market to lows not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.
 It has torn through China, South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, including Italy, and sickened nearly 100,000 people in at least 84 countries. More than 3,000 have died, according to Centers for Disease Control.
 “The virus could exact a heavy economic toll in the G7 contries, as it leads to quarantines, shutters factories, and hits investor and consumer confidence,” The New York Times reported this week.
 The virus is a little-known disease “named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface,” the Times reported. It can “infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to lung lesions and pneumonia.”
 The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus rose to 10 on Thursday and numerous patients were being treated in at least 13 states. Four more cases were reported in Florida.
 “The United States has dozens of other confirmed infections, the majority of them people who were among the passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess,” the Washington Post reported.
 In Seattle and King County’s public health department, Jeff Duchin was among health care officials who pointed to the need for increased testing facilities to stem the rise of the virus.
 “The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,” he told the Post. “We’re going to see a lot of sick people and we’re going to have a tremendous challenge on our health care system,” he said, adding that “it’s impossible for me to predict what the peak of this outbreak will be.”
 Duchin added, “We expect the number of cases will continue to increase in the coming days and weeks, and we’re taking this situation very seriously.”
 In San Antonio, Texas, health care officials “lambasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the agency released a woman who later was found to have the novel coronavirus.”
 “The city unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the release of dozens of people scheduled to leave quarantine in the San Antonio area and demanded another round of tests be performed,” it was reported.
 “We simply cannot have a screw-up like this from our federal partners,” said San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg.
 The House and Senate on Thursday approved an $8.3 billion coronavirus spending package, which far exceeds the $1.25 billion spending request that President Trump sent Congress last week.
 Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been pushing the pharmaceutical industry to develop a vaccine to combat the coronavirus. Human trials could begin in April.
 But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a vaccine would take up to 12 to 18 months to develop.
 Meantime, the growing concern, and scandal, in all of this is that the federal government has failed to prepare for this kind of nationwide medical crisis that threatens our country.
 “The amount of federal funding given to state and local officials to prepare for health emergencies has been cut in half or more over the past couple of decades,” Crystal Watson, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
 Top government health officials say the two biggest federal programs created to deal with such emergencies have had their funding slashed from $1.4 billion in 2003 to only $662 million this year.
 “Every administration has made cuts to these programs,” Watson said.
 Testing kits and ventilators in health care centers across the country are woefully in short supply.
 A survey of nursing homes in the U.S. by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2008 found that over half of them lacked enough supplies needed to deal with a crisis.
 That is the situation our country finds itself in today.

 Do you have a dog you think is the cat's meow?
 America's Hometown Hound wants a meet-up.
 Sarah Jane Tolman of Just Around the Corner, a pet sitting and dog walking business in Plymouth, said her company has launched the first-ever America's Hometown Hound contest. To participate, all you have to do is upload a picture of your furry friend and write why you feel your dog should be America's Hometown Hound.
 Just Around the Corner owner Pam Ranhein came up with the idea, Tolman said, after learning of a friend in Ireland who had launched a similar contest. Ranhein wanted to bring the whole region together for the launch of what would be an annual event. It's particularly important now because it's the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the Mayflower, which, incidentally, had a dog on board. And you don't have to just be from Plymouth to participate. Tolman said the contest is open to towns throughout the South Shore region. The only requirement is that you attend the Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce's Bark in the Park event May 2 at Nelson Park, when the winner will be announced.
 Submissions close March 21 and the voting begins March 23.
 The public will decide which dogs will make it into the first round of 25, and then will be asked to vote for 10. The final round of online voting will pick the top three winners and America's Hometown Hound will be announced at Bark in the Park.
 The canine winner will then become a dog ambassador for the year, used in 2021 Bark in the Park advertising, and having guest appearances at the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving parades.
 The winner will receive a free photo shoot of their dog with photographer Kelli Wagner, free flea and tick treatments from Burgess Pest Management, and dog training by Ken Brady of To the Rescue Canine Training of Plymouth.
 So, grab your dog and camera and think about what makes him or her so very special.
 Just Around the Corner Pet Sitting and Dog Walking is located at 2277 State Road. For more information on the company, visit justaroundthecornerpetsit.com.

Madison also appeared on _After the Final Rose_ , and Peter declared his love for her. However, it looked like Barb wasn't happy about the reunion. Not only did Barb accuse Madison of making her and her family wait three hours to see her during the finale, but she also claimed Madison said she didn't love Peter and wouldn't accept a proposal. In the end, she said her son would just have to "fail to succeed."
 Madison insisted she has "love and respect" for Peter and his family and said she'd "never say a negative word about anyone or anything."
 "Honestly, this is about me and Peter, our journey, just he and I should be talking about it," she later added.
 Chris admitted he was shocked by Barb's exchange with Madison. While he said he knew Barb "wasn't in a great mood" when he saw her, he said he "didn't know what she was mad at and…didn't think that was what was going to happen."
 "I didn't think she was just going to roll right over Peter like that," he said. "Even when we tried to fix that--I thought, OK, we're going to come back from this and she's going to say, 'You know what? At the end of the day, it's my boy'--it just never got there."

The Boeing MAX, a new-generation aircraft, enjoyed 19 months of successful flying after its launch in August 2017. But in March 2019, things started going horribly wrong for the aircraft after Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed soon after take off from Addis Ababa airport. Months earlier, Lion Air Flight 610 had crashed, killing all those on board.
 One year on, the core issue identified is a problem with the aircraft’s instability in a part of its aerodynamic design.
 The Boeing 737 MAX is powered by CFM LEAP-1B engines which are larger than the old CFM-7 engines, and produce a lot more thrust and drag compared with previous installations in the Boeing 737 NG (Next Generation) aircraft, making the engines on the MAX more powerful.
 Captain PP Singh, now an examiner on the Airbus 330 with Nepal Airlines, says that from a certification point of view, there was a lot of pressure on Boeing to prove that the MAX aircraft was very similar, if not identical, to the B737 NG aircraft that came before it.
 “The global population of the Boeing 737 aircraft is large. If the airlines buying the MAX had to retrain their pilots for the MAX, it would have been a huge cost for them.
 This happened at a time when Airbus, the other producer of narrow-body aircraft, already had the New Engine Option (NEO) of the Airbus A320 family, which allowed a seamless common pilot qualification between the A320 and the A320neo,” Captain Singh points out.
 Hence, Boeing, too, wanted an aircraft which was superior but could be flown by pilots who were already flying the B737 NG.
 Hence, the company installed a system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to synthetically alter aircraft control laws to provide pilots the same ‘control feel’ as the B737 NG.
 “In a nutshell, Boeing tried to overcome a physics problem with a software solution,” Captain Singh says.
 Internal emails, which have now been leaked, show that Boeing software engineers had warned of issues with the technology; but with cost being a key consideration, these were not addressed.
 ## Desperate moves
 After the Lion Air crash, Boeing tried to insinuate (it could not directly comment anything as the inquiry was on-going) that the crash was caused by a pilot error. An infuriated Lion Air management threatened to cancel all Boeing orders and take Airbus aircraft instead.
 Boeing also maintained that the MAX came with some in-built safety features to ensure a safe flight. However, this claim was negated when the Ethiopian Airlines MAX aircraft crashed in March 2019.
 Pilots recall that the inquiry report into the incident showed that the pilots of the ill-fated Ethiopian flight turned off two switches that were supposed to cut off power, but that failed to arrest the dive of the aircraft. In desperation, the pilots then switched them back on, but in vain.
 Pilots feel that Boeing will now have to answer two issues — what modifications in equipment will be sufficient to win back the confidence of global regulators and put the aircraft back in the air; and what can be the contribution of an average pilot to a safe flight of the aircraft in case of any untoward incident?
 “Every pilot doesn’t have the flying skills of a Sully or the chief test pilot of Boeing or Airbus,” Captain Singh says. Therefore, the manufacturer has to make sure the aircraft is modified appropriately and the pilots told what they can do to address any emergency.
 However, what is more worrying for Boeing and the airlines that flew the MAX is that the two fatal crashes exposed only some of the problems with the aircraft. Pilots maintain that one year is a long time for a plane to be grounded, and in this period, a number of new problems have cropped up.
 The latest was reported in February 2020 when Foreign Object Debris (FOD) was discovered in the fuel tanks of some of the parked MAX.
 These add to the already long list of troubles with the MAX, and there is no knowing how many more such issues will crop up as the aircraft continues to be grounded across the globe.

It's a little bit difficult to predict, of course. I mean, we've seen, I think, probably half a dozen different estimates on that. Most likely, there would be some advanced need for the printers. It's a function of what's coming down the production line. If you remember, the -- with the Boeing 737, this is BFE or buyer furnished equipment. So we need to make sure that the right tails have the right printers associated with them. So typically, and I say, I emphasize typically because we don't know exactly half the staff in this case, those would have to lead the production. It's not a just-in-time thing. It's typically months, if not several months in advance that some of these things start arriving. Again, it's a follow up in the air at this point.

Several Leicester City players have been kept away from the squad as a precaution after showing symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, manager Brendan Rodgers said on Thursday. Top European leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga have been suspended after players either tested positive for the coronavirus or were quarantined as a precaution.
 "We've had a few players that have shown symptoms and signs (of coronavirus). We've followed procedures and they have been kept away from the squad," Rodgers told reporters ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Watford. "We've got a fantastic medical team who give guidance to the players and staff. Nationally, it's been made clear what the symptoms are."
 The Premier League has yet to make a call on whether games should be suspended or played behind closed doors. Rodgers said public health should be a top priority. "From a football perspective it would be a shame but the public's health is the most important aspect in all of this," Rodgers added. "We are guided by organisations and governments.
 "When the stands are full, that's when it's your time to shine. That's why we do it, we're doing it for them. When they're not there, it's not the same experience." European soccer's governing body UEFA will hold a video conference meeting of all 55 federations plus representatives of clubs, leagues and players to discuss the virus's impact on all football in the region, including Euro 2020.
 Rodgers also confirmed full back Ricardo Pereira is out for the rest of the season after sustaining an ACL injury while midfielder James Maddison will return from a calf injury only after the international break at the end of the month.

Do you have a dog you think is the cat's meow?
 America's Hometown Hound wants a meet-up.
 Sarah Jane Tolman of Just Around the Corner, a pet sitting and dog walking business in Plymouth, said her company has launched the first-ever America's Hometown Hound contest. To participate, all you have to do is upload a picture of your furry friend and write why you feel your dog should be America's Hometown Hound.
 Just Around the Corner owner Pam Ranhein came up with the idea, Tolman said, after learning of a friend in Ireland who had launched a similar contest. Ranhein wanted to bring the whole region together for the launch of what would be an annual event. It's particularly important now because it's the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the Mayflower, which, incidentally, had a dog on board. And you don't have to just be from Plymouth to participate. Tolman said the contest is open to towns throughout the South Shore region. The only requirement is that you attend the Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce's Bark in the Park event May 2 at Nelson Park, when the winner will be announced.
 Submissions close March 21 and the voting begins March 23.
 The public will decide which dogs will make it into the first round of 25, and then will be asked to vote for 10. The final round of online voting will pick the top three winners and America's Hometown Hound will be announced at Bark in the Park.
 The canine winner will then become a dog ambassador for the year, used in 2021 Bark in the Park advertising, and having guest appearances at the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving parades.
 The winner will receive a free photo shoot of their dog with photographer Kelli Wagner, free flea and tick treatments from Burgess Pest Management, and dog training by Ken Brady of To the Rescue Canine Training of Plymouth.
 So, grab your dog and camera and think about what makes him or her so very special.
 Just Around the Corner Pet Sitting and Dog Walking is located at 2277 State Road. For more information on the company, visit justaroundthecornerpetsit.com.

Airlines bore the brunt of a dramatic expansion of the coronavirus crisis on Thursday, as U.S. travel curbs on much of continental Europe deepened the sector's misery and piled more pressure on governments to offer emergency support. The 30-day restrictions will badly disrupt transatlantic traffic key to the earnings of major European carriers and their U.S. airline partners, analysts warned, as the move hit travel stocks already battered by the virus outbreak.
 Those routes account for 20-30% of large European operators' revenue and a majority of profit, Credit Suisse analyst Neil Glynn warned, "highlighting the damage to revenue lines for the coming weeks and potentially well into the summer." Glynn added: "A ban on travel to the U.S. will likely mean heavier cuts" than the drastic capacity reductions already ordered as airlines scrapped flights - first to China and then to other destinations including Italy as the virus spread.
 Shares in European and U.S. airlines slumped in turn to new lows, with Delta and United Airlines down more than 13% and American Airlines 7.2% lower. Air France-KLM was down 9.1% at 1506 GMT, with British Airways parent IAG down 10.7% and Lufthansa 11.5% lower. Troubled Norwegian Air and U.S.-dependent Icelandair both plunged more than 20%.
 The U.S. curbs on travel from the 26-country Schengen Area - which excludes Britain and Ireland \- are similar to restrictions on China that took effect on Feb. 1 and do not apply to U.S. residents or their immediate family. "The ban effectively stops travel from the Schengen Area to the USA," said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska - predicting a "more substantial" earnings impact than European carriers had suffered from the earlier China flight suspensions.
 U.S. airlines had already cut flight schedules to Italy and will take another hit from lower demand for flights from major destinations such as France and Germany. Among them, American Airlines could be relatively spared by its alliance with British Airways (BA) and higher share of UK traffic, while Air France-KLM partner Delta and Lufthansa ally United Airlines are likely to suffer more, analysts say.
 U.S. Vice President Mike Pence defended the travel curbs on Thursday, after the European Union complained they had been imposed "unilaterally and without consultation". The virus has taken root in the United States after spreading from China to Italy, South Korea, Iran and elsewhere.
 'TOTAL MELTDOWN' Airlines had already been scrambling to respond to a global travel slump that looks increasingly likely to require government aid to avoid widespread insolvencies. The EU will publish new state-aid guidelines on Friday.
 Germany may extend loans and other support to airlines, a government official said on Thursday. The French government also stands ready to help Air France- KLM, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. "There is a need for measures from many governments," said Norwegian pilots' union president Yngve Carlsen. "This could lead to a total meltdown."
 Scandinavian carrier SAS is in talks with the Swedish and Danish governments about potential support measures, a company spokeswoman said. EU airlines have seized on the crisis to push back on green taxes designed to help the bloc meet climate goals - including proposals to end current tax exemptions on jet fuel.
 "New fiscal burdens should be postponed until the industry is back on a sound operational and financial footing," lobby group Airlines for Europe said. CRITICAL TIME
 The latest travel clampdown could make coronavirus worse than previous aviation crises including the 9/11 attacks of 2001, UK-based consultant John Strickland said. "It's coming at the end of the northern hemisphere winter, which is a weak period for airline finances (when) they should be sowing seeds of a strong summer season by getting the bookings in," he said.
 Air France-KLM and Lufthansa said they were still studying the implications of the U.S. move for flight schedules. IAG is potentially less impacted thanks to BA's Heathrow base. There were panicky European airport scenes as travellers scrambled to fly to the United States before the restrictions take effect late on March 13.
 The fallout is also spreading fast from travel and tourism to aerospace and other industries. Safran, the world's third-biggest aerospace group, sees a growing threat to aircraft and engine order books, Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said on Thursday, adding more cost cuts were now being drawn up.
 ADP declined to comment on a report it was preparing to close Terminal 3 at Roissy Charles de Gaulle, the French capital's main aviation hub. Norway may close several airports, operator Avinor said. Italy announced the partial closure of Rome's main airports to commercial aviation in response to its own travel lockdown. Near-empty airports in Milan and elsewhere may follow, a government source told Reuters.
 The travel curbs will also decimate European tourists' spending in the United States. In March 2019, European visitors accounted for 29% of arrivals and $3.4 billion in spending, the U.S. Travel Association said. "Temporarily shutting off travel from Europe is going to exacerbate the already-heavy impact of coronavirus on the travel industry and the 15.7 million Americans whose jobs depend on travel," U.S. Travel Association President Roger Dow said.

He was elected consul too, with his right-hand man Mark Antony as his co-consul.

Technical chart claims that Boingo Wireless, Inc. (WIFI) would settle between $11.54/share to $12.58/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $9.93 mark, then the market for Boingo Wireless, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $9.36 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -1.94. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Amid rise in novel coronavirus cases in India, the government on Thursday asked people not to panic, saying no community transmission of the virus has been observed and there has only been a few cases of local transmission so far. Asserting that the safety and welfare of its citizens abroad have always been a priority for India, the government said starting from Friday, three back-to-back evacuations will be made to bring back Indians from Iran.With novel coronavirus being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation WHO, health ministry officials said even though the virus is difficult to isolate, scientists at the National Institute of Virology NIV, Pune, have been successful in finding about 11 isolates, but developing a vaccine will take at least one-and-a-half to two years. The number of COVID-19 patients in India has risen to 74, which includes 16 Italians and one Canadian. The figure also includes three patients from Kerala who were discharged last month following recovery.Lav Aggarwal, the Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry, said 1,500 people who came in contact with the 74 infected people were under rigorous observation while over 30,000 people across the country were under community surveillance. India presently has around 1 lakh testing kits. More testing kits have been ordered and they are in procurement, he said.As far as transmission of the disease is concerned, Aggarwal said, Luckily for India we do not have any community transmission. We only have a few cases that have come from outside and have primarily affected their close family members. The remark came days after the ministry, in an official statement, said cases of community transmission of the virus have been observed. About evacuation measures undertaken so far, Aggarwal said till now, India has evacuated 948 people from coronavirus-affected countries.Of these, 900 were Indians and 48 belonged to different nationalities including from the Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, the USA, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa and Peru, he said. A Civil Aviation Ministry official said starting from Friday, three back-to-back evacuations will be carried out to bring Indians back from Iran.The first evacuation from Iran will take place tomorrow and around 200 people are expected to reach Mumbai airport around 12.30 pm. The second evacuation will be on March 15 and the flight will arrive at Delhi airport. The third evacuation from Iran is likely to be on March 16 or 17, the official said, adding on Tuesday, 58 evacuees from Iran had arrived in India, which included 25 men, 31 women and two children all of whom are asymptomatic at present.Moreover, 83 evacuees from Italy who arrived in India on Wednesday have been housed at the Manesar quarantine facility. All patients in hospitals are being treated and reported to be stable, officials said. The health ministry said India has always prioritised the safety and welfare of its citizens abroad and mounted timely operations from February 1 to evacuate them from coronavirus-affected countries.Aggarwal said the government has made 52 laboratories functional for testing samples while 57 labs have been designated for helping in sample collection to enhance diagnosis and detection capacity of the disease. The focus is on preventive approach and adequate testing facilities have been made available, he said.Raman R Gangakhedkar, the head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I ECD-I, division of the Indian Council of Medical Research ICMR said scientists at the NIV in Pune have been successful in isolating the virus strain. Coronaviruses are difficult to isolate. But the efforts of the scientists of NIV Pune have been successful and about 11 isolates of coronavirus are available which is a prime requisite for doing any kind of research related to viruses. Even with expedited clinical trials and approvals, it will take not less than one-and-a- half-years to two years to develop a vaccine, he said.Officials said that Indias efforts to deal with coronavirus are in consonance with WHO and the focus is on preventive approach. The government has stepped up vigil and following a strong contact tracing system to ensure anyone who has come in touch with the infected are not missed out. Till now, 11,14,025 people have been screened at 30 designated airports in India, they said. Asked whether high temperature kills coronavirus, officials said there was no study or evidence till now to suggest that.As the contagious disease with flu-like symptoms spread across the globe, the cabinet secretary on Wednesday said states and Union Territories should invoke provisions of section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, so that all advisories issued by the Union health ministry and state governments are enforceable. India has suspended all visas, except for a few categories such as diplomatic and employment, till April 15 in a bid to contain the spread of the respiratory virus, according to a revised travel advisory. The government also strongly advised Indians to avoid all non-essential travel abroad.Visa-free travel facility granted to Overseas Citizenship of India OCI card holders is also kept in abeyance till April 15, according to the advisory issued on Wednesday. It said, any foreign national who intends to travel to India for compelling reason may contact the nearest Indian Mission and that all incoming travellers, including Indian nationals, arriving from or having visited China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after February 15 will be quarantined for a minimum 14 days..

Slovakia will introduce border checks, stop international travel to and from the country and close schools as it steps up measures to battle the spreading coronavirus, Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said on Thursday.
 The central European country, which has so far reported 16 cases of the new virus, also plans to close sport, leisure and entertainment centres such as ski areas, pools and clubs, and will shut all shopping centres this coming weekend. Pellegrini said Slovakia's international airports would close and international bus and train travel would also be halted, though international freight transport would continue.
 The school closures will last for 14 days from Monday, Pellegrini said. "Our goal is to delay the increase of this illness in Slovakia," he said. "We have to buy time. The later the contagion comes, the more information from scientists we will have and we can take more new measures."
 Slovakia had already banned flights to and from Italy \- the country worst hit by the outbreak in Europe - and banned cultural, sport and other public events. A 14-day quarantine period imposed on Slovak citizens returning from Italy will now be extended to all those returning from abroad, Pellegrini said on Thursday.

LONDON -- Oil prices fell more than 6% on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced restrictions on travel from Europe in an attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus after the World Health Organization described the outbreak as a pandemic.
 The slump in oil is being compounded by the threat of a flood of cheap supply after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said they would raise output in a stand-off with Russia.
 Brent crude was down $2.33, or 6.5%, at $33.46 a barrel by 1359 GMT. U.S. crude was down $1.79, or 5.4%, at $31.19.
 Global equities were also hit after President Trump said the United States would suspend all travel from Europe, except Britain and Ireland, as he unveiled measures to contain the coronavirus.
 The oil market was taking the decision very negatively because of the expected impact on jet fuel demand, business activity and economic growth, said Bjoernar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at energy consultant Rystad.
 "It leads to further loss of confidence in governments' handling of the fallout and increases uncertainty about the extent of the virus impact on the overall economy, reflected in sharp falls in risk assets across the board this morning."
 The two benchmarks are down about 50% from highs reached in January. They suffered their biggest one-day declines since the 1991 Gulf War on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched a price war.
 The six-month Brent contango spread from May to November widened to as low as $6.40 a barrel, a level not seen since February 2015.
 Contango is where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price, prompting traders to fill tankers with oil to store for later delivery.
 The cost to transport oil on supertankers soared as major producers scrambled to secure vessels to ship more crude in an effort to regain market share and buyers took advantage of plunging oil prices.
 As many await to see who will break first in the Saudi-Russia price war, Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at MUFG, said: "We believe that both sides have enough financial capacity and sufficiently divergent goals to sustain the oil price war for many quarters, not months."
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have cut forecasts for oil demand because of the coronavirus outbreak and now expect demand to contract this quarter.
 "We estimate a production surplus could reach between 5 million and 6 million barrels per day in April," said Kirill Tachennikov, director and senior oil analyst at BCS Global Markets in Moscow.
 "However, despite the volatility, we expect to see global oil demand normalize as we move towards the second half of 2020 - likely without the need of OPEC intervention."

Five persons were arrested for allegedly operating a fake call centre and duping people to the tune of lakhs by promising them loans and insurance in Maharashtra's Thane city, police said on Thursday. The police on Wednesday arrested asGanesh Tiruvalli, Ganesh Manjrekar, Gyaneshwar Kamble, Dheeraj Singh and Tushar Sonvane, who operated a call centre at Wagle Estate, an official said.
 The accused allegedly targetted people from rural areas by offering them loans at zero interest on the condition that they buy insurance from then, he said. The men would then collect money from the victims for insurance and later leave them without loans, he added.
 The arrests came after the police received a complaint from one of the victims who had lost over Rs 1.50 lakh, he said. The accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act, he said, adding that further probe is underway..

Aus meiner Sicht, ist das vierte Argument das stärkste von allen. Beim Poketalk S müsst Ihr weder ein Konto anlegen, noch Euch anmelden. Einfach aus der Schachtel ziehen und schon könnt Ihr Euch quer durch die Sprachen übersetzen lassen. Klar, die Übersetzung selbst passiert in der Cloud. Aber die Online-Dienstleister können die gesprochenen Wörter keiner einzelnen Person mehr zuordnen. Der Vorgang ist komplett anonym.
 Daher halte ich den Pocketalk S besonders für Nutzer interessant, die den Schutz ihrer Privatsphäre besonders im Blick haben. Denn mit diesem Gerät wird Google nicht alles mithören und alles mit Eurem Konto oder Standort verknüpfen. Trotzdem hat der Pocketalk S ein Problem und das ist ganz schön schwerwiegend.
 ## Der Übersetzer ist einfach viel zu teuer
 In den Vereinigten Staaten liegt der Preis für den Pocketalk S bei 299 Dollar. Bei uns in Europa werdet Ihr 299 Euro für eines der Geräte zahlen müssen. Ich hatte bereits erwähnt, dass Ihr für den Preis einen Zwei-Jahres-Datenplan bekommt. Ist dieser aber abgelaufen müsst Ihr weitere 50 Euro für eine einjährige Verlängerung berappen. Und mal unter uns: 300 Euro sind schon eine verdammt stattliche Summe für ein Gerät, das auch nichts anderes tut, als zu übersetzen.
 Wenn man bedenkt, was für Smartphones man heute für das Geld bekommt, überrascht es mich nicht, dass Sourcenext gerade bei Geschäftskunden erfolgreich ist. Immerhin gibt es hier mehr Zahlungsbereitschaft. Und für sie ist der Pocketalk S offenbar das Produkt, das die eine benötigte Funktion sehr gut erfüllt.
 Versteht mich nicht falsch! Der Pocketalk S ist wirklich ein cooles Stück Technik. Und ich würde ihn selbst in Ländern nutzen, deren Landessprache ich nicht beherrsche und wo Englisch nicht gut verstanden wird. Aber für den Preis, ist er dann doch eher ein Spielzeug für den Fünf-Sterne-Touristen.
 Wollt Ihr das Gerät für Eure nächsten Reisen nutzen, könnt Ihr den Pocketalk S in ausgewählten europäischen Märkten kaufen (unter anderem in Deutschland). Amazon verspricht erste Lieferungen für den 14. März 2020.

NEW YORK -- A dying Bernard Madoff wants to tell the U.S. judge who will decide whether to free him from prison that he has accepted responsibility for his massive Ponzi scheme, and is sincerely remorseful for his crimes and their impact on victims.
 In court papers filed late Wednesday and early Thursday, Madoff's lawyer Brandon Sample asked Circuit Judge Denny Chin to schedule a hearing in Manhattan where the 81-year-old Madoff could speak by phone from his prison in Butner, North Carolina, where he has served nearly 11 years of his 150-year term. A hearing would "likely to be the last proceeding in this case before Mr Madoff's death," expected within 18 months, Sample said. "Allowing Mr. Madoff to give what is, in effect, a final dying, personal plea is eminently reasonable."
 Sample also submitted a letter from a person who agreed to house Madoff, but asked it not be made public because it "could lead to harassment or other invasions of the letter writer's privacy given the extremely public nature of this case."
 A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which opposes Madoff's release, declined to comment.
 Prosecutors have said Madoff used his firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC to swindle thousands of individuals, charities, pension funds and hedge funds, including many with ties to the Jewish community, over multiple decades.
 A court-appointed trustee estimated Madoff's customers lost $17.5 billion, of which nearly $14 billion has been recovered.
 Prosecutors estimated the fraud at $64.8 billion, based on amounts Madoff told customers they had in their accounts just before his Dec. 2008 arrest.
 Chin called Madoff's crimes "extraordinarily evil" in imposing the 150-year sentence in June 2009.
 Madoff is seeking "compassionate release" under the First Step Act, a bipartisan 2018 law affording early freedom to some older prisoners, often for health reasons.
 Sample has said Madoff is dying of kidney failure, and is also confined to a wheelchair and battling several other illnesses.
 Prosecutors have said the scope of Madoff's crimes, his refusal to accept responsibility, and his practice of "deflecting blame" toward victims in interviews from prison justify keeping him behind bars. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Macfie)

Technical chart claims that Delek US Holdings, Inc. (DK) would settle between $11.96/share to $13.31/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $9.74 mark, then the market for Delek US Holdings, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $8.87 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -4.49. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Any home will have a few boxes of financial documents and other important papers. But what about a city?
 Alexander City has millions of pages of documents dating back to the 1890s. Dumping old documents may sound easy, but it’s a complicated process due to records retention laws. Some can be disposed of in a year, 10 years or 50 years but others can never be thrown away — ordinances, deeds or personnel files. To confuse matters more, the documents are filed in different ways and stored in nearly 30 different locations across the city. There are at least 10 locations in city hall alone.
 “The clerk is the custodian of the city’s records,” city clerk Amanda Thomas said. “Because we have had multiple clerks with different filing methods in different areas of the city, records can be difficult to locate.”
 Thomas said 2,500 square feet of the third floor of the municipal complex will be dedicated to storing city documents. Just because it has the space doesn’t mean the city has to keep everything but Alabama law also dictates how city records can be destroyed.
 “No county, municipal or other local government official shall cause any county, municipal or other local government record to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of without first obtaining the approval of the Local Government Records Commission,” Alabama Code 41-13-23 reads.
 The Local Government Records Commission falls under the umbrella of the Alabama Department of Archives and History. Some records can be destroyed quickly while others are held onto permanently. Michel Bryan has a long history with keeping up medical records and was hired as a records clerk in November 2019 after the Alexander City City Council created the position.
 “Before we can destroy a record, we have to get permission,” Bryan said. “We have to send a request to the Local Government Records Commission stating what kind of record it is and how long the city has had it.”
 So far Bryan has sent requests to the Alabama Department of Archives and History to destroy 130 boxes of records. Of the records sorted since mid- November 66 boxes remain in possession the city. Bryan is even color coding and numbering documents so they can be found on the shelves at the municipal complex.
 The massive sorting project has another objective beyond freeing up space: organizing records so they are useful. Bryan and Thomas said Laserfiche, a company specializing in document scanning and retention, will be used to scan documents into a searchable digital format.
 “It is to be able to provide a centralized filing system with efficient access to all department heads,” Thomas said. “It will help greatly when citizens make a public records request. It can currently take us forever to find something. If we can keyword search it, pin it together and put it in a PDF and email it back, it’s done.”
 Bryan said the gas department was looking for plans for gas lines and valves around Walgreens recently but the plans are on paper and stored amongst hundreds of other plans.
 “I got lucky,” Bryan said. “It didn’t take too long to find it because I started on the right end.”
 Laserfiche employees are coming to Alexander City to train Bryan and others next week on the software. Thomas said city employees are already prepping documents generated in the last few months from being formated to be scanned. Thomas said a header lets the system know it is a resolution or ordinance, another area lets the system know the document’s name and the footer lists the date. All of the information is inputted into the document’s metadata and the text is available for a keyword search.
 “A department head might search for something by keyword and pull up an ordinance, resolution and water tap,” Thomas said. “Currently they are stored in different places.”
 Thomas said resolutions and ordinances are bound but scanning them gives quicker access. Many of the documents approved at a council meeting will quickly be entered into the system.
 “We already have a morning-after council procedure,” Thomas said. “It will allow agreements and other things approved the night before to be available the next day.”
 It’s a neverending project as a municipality is constantly generating documents. In Alexander City documents are created daily in the departments of public works, fire, police, light, water, sewer departments, parks and recreation, human resources and more.
 The record sorting process even has the help of Benjamin Russell co-op students senior Abby Macon and junior Kaitlyn Riggins. The students had little idea of the volumes of documents the city possesses or what all is required on city projects.
 “There is a lot of retention of documents,” Riggins said. “I didn’t realize how much paper was needed.”
 Macon said, “I didn’t realize what all the different types of services the city had. There is so much required in the way of documentation.”
 Bryan said city employees are speaking with officials at Augusta, Georgia who already use Laserfiche. Bryan and Thomas hope they can get Alexander City’s system to match Augusta’s with Laserfiche, a geographic information system and Cityworks, a work order management system, working together.
 “Their systems talk to each other,” Bryan said.
 Even though record retention is directed through the Alabama Department of Archives and History, the department is already recognizing Bryan, Macon, Riggins and Thomas’ efforts promoting it as a best practice.
 “They say we are in the top 1% in the state,” Thomas said. “They want us to demonstrate what we are doing.”
