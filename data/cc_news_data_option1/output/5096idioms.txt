"La trasformazione digitale sarà fra i motori della ripartenza - ha affermato Mattarella -, dando impulso a molteplici settori e servizi: dalla manifattura, all'agricoltura, alla sanità, all'istruzione, alla cultura". "Lo sviluppo del digitale abbinato a tecnologie verdi per affrontare meglio la sfida ambientale consentirà di inoltrarsi lungo un sentiero di sviluppo più virtuoso più solido e rivolto al futuro. Non è un caso che il Recovery plan sia stato affiancato nella progettualità e nel bilancio comunitario al New green deal" ha aggiunto Mattarella sottolineando l'importanza della partecipazione a "programmi comuni per la ricerca e l'innovazione" e la "collaborazione tra Paesi di cui il Cotec è promotore". Il Capo dello Stato ha sottolineato inoltre che "colmare i divari nelle tecnologie digitali, nella connettività è essenziale". Inoltre, ha rimarcato Mattarella, "la ripartenza dell'Italia non potrà fare a meno del contributo del Mezzogiorno e in esso del talento dei suoi giovani. I giovani devono essere non soltanto i beneficiari ma anche i protagonisti della stagione post Covid".

Particularly because Aliyev did not say anything new. While Erdoğan even recited poems about Lachin [a strategically important town in Nagorno- Karabakh].

However, that may not be the case with many countries. After more than five years in the saddle, the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has witnessed more human rights abuses than those before it since 1999. Boko Haram still attacks, abducts and kills in the North-East and carries through many other lethal onslaughts. Violent clashes between farmers and herdsmen have equally ended in fatalities.<br

Eugene Boonie, 55, who is from Navajo Nation, fills up his water tank at the livestock water spigot in the Bodaway Chapter in the Navajo Nation, in Gap, Arizona, September 17, 2020.

"We have to come here to get our water about every other day. Pretty much everyone in this area gets their water here. We used to be able to get water from the rainwater but it just has not been raining this summer or even for the past couple years," said Boonie. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith
