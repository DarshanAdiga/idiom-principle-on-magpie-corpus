A pivotal event leading to Trump's impeachment was a July 25 call in which he asked Ukraine's president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden for corruption and to probe a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.


  Democrats have called that an abuse of power, saying Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in a U.S. election for his own benefit at the expense of American national security.


  Trump is also accused by Democrats of abusing his power by withholding $391 million in security aid to Ukraine to pressure Kiev into conducting investigations politically beneficial to him. The money - approved by Congress to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists - eventually was provided to Ukraine in September after the controversy became public.


  Republicans have argued that Trump's actions did not rise to the level of impeachable offences. They have accused Democrats of using the Ukraine affair as a way to nullify Trump's 2016 election victory.


  One bone of contention between Democrats and Republicans has been whether witnesses should appear in the trial, a wild card that could affect public sentiment toward Trump.


  Democrats will push to hear from witnesses during the trial, something Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has resisted, arguing that senators should consider only the evidence amassed by the House.

Several of the new songs will be aired this month on the band’s UK tour. “What was really positive from the last gig we did in Liverpool was people I’ve known a long time saying things about the new songs. It was really beautiful people responding,” Head says.


  “It’s stripped down to a five-piece intentionally and we wanted to not make it like the last gigs that we’d done. Because it’s a new album, we wanted to play predominantly as many new songs from it as we could. But we are mixing it up, there are some songs that we didn’t play in the past 20 years. It’s a two- way street, isn’t it, with the members of the audience. There’s a mutual respect, I would’ve thought. That’s what I get anyway from the gigs we do.”


  In recent years Head has written a collection of short stories and a screenplay. “I think short stories are an extension of cramming stories into three-and-a-half or four minute songs,” he says. “I’ve always done it and I’ve got a couple of ideas on the go at the moment.”


  In the meantime, he needs to raise cash to complete the new album. “We’re getting the money together to do the sessions. Bill’s really busy, so when he’s got time he lets us know. It’s a work in progress, if you like. We’re going to get some songs down and possibly put it to someone to say, ‘do you want to finance the rest of the album?’”
