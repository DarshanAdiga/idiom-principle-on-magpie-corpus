"This is an inquiry into the violent rape of a young woman and I would ask anyone with any information to search their conscience and do the right thing by calling police.
 "If you do not want to give your name you can call Crimestoppers, who will not ask for your details, but however you want to do it, call and tell us what you know.

In a lot of ways though, _Minecraft Dungeons_ seems like a more traditional adventure game. There’s a guiding narrative stitching each mission together about needing to save a bunch of villagers from an outcast villager who got hold of an evil power source and is now using it to get revenge. Mojang says playing through this story will take about five hours. The rest of the game will revolve around exploring alternative paths in levels and replaying them on harder difficulties with the benefit of procedurally generated parts that will hopefully change up how you fight each time. Two story-based DLC expansions are currently planned, but otherwise there’s no in-game microtransaction shop or season pass in the works. While every other online multiplayer game seems to have evolved into a game-as-a-service, _Minecraft Dungeons_ is apparently taking a more old school approach.

"The connection between fans, players and club was in a difficult state at that moment. We had to change that energy, the belief and the commitment from the players."


  It took Arsenal a few weeks to get show any signs of improvement under Arteta, with the turning point coming in a New Years' Day win over Man Utd.


  He added: "I was very pleased because everyone was on board with what we were doing. We started to win three or four games in a row and there was a much more positive mindset around the place."


  Arteta's problems have not gone away yet though, with Arsenal still needing a significant rebuild if they are to challenge for major honours.

Justice Cecilia Koranteng Addow is one of three Justices immortalised by Ghana’s Judiciary. On the night of June 30, 1982, Mrs Addo who was nursing a child, Justice Poku Sarkodie and Justice Kwadwo Adjei Agyapong as well as a retired military officer were abducted from their homes. Some individuals were indicted for the crime by the Provisional National Defence Council’s (PNDC) Special Investigation Board that probed the killings. They are Tony Tekpor, Dzandu, Hekli and Joachim Amartey Kwei. They were executed but one L/Cpl Amedeka still remains at large.

Our team has been working around the clock to keep a pulse on the needs of our business community in these challenging times. This week, nearly 200 business leaders responded to our weekly poll. Forty-one percent of them are changing up their product mix to support essential needs industries.
   
 In order for those employers to provide these critical products, their employees are stepping up and answering the call to equip hospitals, health care systems and the front line of doctors, nurses, first responders and other critical infrastructure workers in this battle of COVID-19. Here are a few examples:
       Herman Miller is completely reconfiguring to make hospital mattress covers and face masks.   Nuvar Manufacturing began manufacturing medical masks. They made more than 3,000 masks in the first week of production.   JR Automation worked with GM to build a mask assembly line in metro Detroit in just six days.   The logistics team at Inontime quickly delivered sneeze guards to all 248 Meijer stores in the US.   When they heard about the demand, Primera Plastics began making disposable face shields.   Start-up company Solismatica is activating 3-D printers statewide to make face shields, masks and ventilator parts. To date, 268 printers are assisting with more than 4,200 items printed.   Hybrid Machining Inc. has become a pick-up and drop-off point for face masks. They are running their machines nonstop to produce more face masks and COVID-19 test swabs.   Hemco Gage is producing mission-critical precision metrology tools for manufacturers making or tooling up to manufacture personal protective equipment, ventilators, respirators, hospital beds and more.     
 We admire these employers' ingenuity, flexibility and coming to the rescue to solve problems and fill needs. This is just small list of the employers who have stepped up in a major way. Please help us salute their employees, thank them for the work they are doing and recognize the difference they are making.

After a few moments you realise that the album isn’t just two super long cuts, but a collection of shorter songs. Some of the songs are nothing more than a bassline/beat and a few lyrics over the top, they show that the band are on a buoyant mood, creatively. It feels like each snippet could easily be extended live, or on the next album, into something monumental.

Already, Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has said the country should be looking "to all-mail ballots across the board" because of the pandemic. But President Donald Trump has weighed in strongly against voting by mail, even though he himself casts absentee ballots and Republicans have often favored mail-in ballots especially for older people.

There are two choices for the governor. Either he does not believe or understand how easily COVID-19 spreads, or he does not care. There is no doubt that allowing church gatherings will infect, sicken and kill more Floridians.


   


  I hope and pray that his ignorance or lack of political courage does not lead to harm for my son who is a sheriff's deputy or my husband and the patients he cares for at the largest skilled nursing facility in Polk County. They don't have the choice to stay home, and every other person who is able and does not stay home jeopardizes their safety, that of the families they come home to and the safety of the entire community and state.


   


  We cannot know if one of these congregants, recently exposed to 50 or 100 others at a church service, is shopping alongside us in the grocery store or just moments before picked up a can of soup, read the label and put it back on the shelf for another to select and bring home to their family.


   


  The science is clear. The experts have spoken. Either the governor shows an astounding lack of knowledge or a shameless lack of political courage and an immeasurable lack of empathy. Either, or, he is not fit to lead.

What was not normal? We sang songs out of order, drank whenever we wanted rather than to the Haggadah's schedule, showed each other our separate tables, took a minute to say what we were thankful for -- each other, technology, and love. My sister Dana's dog and my cat sometimes took over our screens. On New York time, Yael and I got hungry and started eating while the others waited.

Tor2 is a joint venture between majority shareholder Kier Group and Torbay Council set up 10 years ago to provide services including kerbside collections for the local authority.


  The waste and recycling collections in Torbay will be taken over by a new council-owned company in July when the current contract with Tor2 ends.


  A Tor2 spokesperson said: "After carefully reviewing the proposed employee salary reductions which would have impacted less than 10% of Tor2 staff on the contract, and in light of the unique circumstances of the Tor2 staff transferring under TUPE to SWISCo on 1 July 2020, we can confirm application of the reductions has been placed on hold for Tor2 staff."
