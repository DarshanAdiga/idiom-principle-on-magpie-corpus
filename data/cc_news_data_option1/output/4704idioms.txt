And though it’s been a uniquely challenging journey, the experience of shepherding “The Climb” to a theatrical release has been one that fully embraces a big part of Topic Studios’ mission. This is true in terms of “taking the full bet” on filmmakers in-house to produce a film like "The Climb" in the first place, and in finding the right distribution partners for the films they co-finance or co-distribute (like the studio has done with movies like “Luce” and Pablo Larrain’s upcoming Princess Diana film “Spencer” with Neon, “Dream Horse” with Bleecker Street and “The Fight” with Magnolia Pictures).

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - We’re probably not going to see lines of people wrapping around buildings to take advantage of those Black Friday deals this year.But a different Black Friday doesn’t necessarily mean a slow one.Spending in Alabama last year during November and December reached an all-time high at $13.25 billion, and analysts say this year’s holiday sales will be unchanged or could even grow.Alabama retailers say these past several months of the pandemic have prepared them to get creative this holiday shopping season.That means offering more curbside pickup, updating their inventory online, and keeping shoppers engaged on social media.And with less people spending money on holiday vacations, the Alabama Retail Association said it’s important shoppers spend that money locally, which means retailers are stepping up their online game.“They are sharing on a daily basis products on their social media, through email blasts, through all the ways that they’ve been communicating with their customers all along,” said Nancy Dennis with ARA. "But they’ve set that up so that customers know-- yes, you can get this if you want to order matching pajamas. You don’t have to do that Amazon. You can get them from our store. "Dennis said more small businesses are also hiring right now to make sure they have enough staff on hand for holiday orders and enough workers if some get sick.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

Baidu has agreed to buy YY Live, a Chinese live streaming service for USD 3.6 billion in cash from social media platform Joyy. The news comes after Baidu released results for the third quarter, showing the company back in the black. The transaction is expected to close some time in the first half.
 Joyy CEO David Xueling Li said the deal will allow YY Live to access Baidu’s user traffic, boosting its business growth and pushing its monetization capabilities. The deal includes the YY mobile app, YY.com website and PCC YY.
 The sale is only for Joyy's Chinese operations. Joyy also owns Bigo, a global tech firm based in Singapore. Bigo itself owns Bigo Live, a global live streaming platform outside of China; Likee, a global short-form video social platform; and a video communication service. The company was listed on the Nasdaq in November 2012.

According to county officials, none of those tests came back positive.
 While inmates have regular temperature checks and none had shown symptoms of COVID-19, Adams said officials believe this surveillance testing was an important proactive step to further screen and monitor the population.
 This was the first time the county had performed mass testing at the facility.
 County spokeswoman Stephanie Weaver said there currently are no known coronavirus cases among the inmates.
 She added that since the testing initiative, one additional staff member has tested positive for the virus. That person has not been working since receiving those results more than a week ago.
 Warden Janine Quigley said prison officials conduct contact tracing and place the housing units where those staff members served in cohort status. This means inmate movement within that housing unit is highly restricted and the temperatures of the inmates are checked twice a day.
 In light of the recent cases among staff members, all counseling and volunteer programs at the prison have been suspended in an attempt to further limit movement and interactions.

The National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) victory after what many believed was a spirited campaign by the Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tejashwi Yadav has once again reignited the debate on the ability, or the lack of it, of the Congress in stopping the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) juggernaut. While the Congress's performance isn't entirely to blame for the NDA's victory in Bihar, the party performed poorly in other bypolls as well, winning only 12 of the 55 assembly constituencies (ACs) it contested out of the 59 ACs that went to the polls across 11 states. What ails the Congress party today?1) Rahul's aggression doesn't inspire confidence anymore...On July 21, 2018, the Opposition brought a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government. There was never any doubt about the government's survival. The strategy was meant to score a political point. Rahul Gandhi, the then Congress president gave what many believed was a combative speech. He was seen as the natural leader of the Opposition. The Congress's fortunes peaked by the end of 2018. It wrested Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh from the BJP, and looked all set to make impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections compared to its 2014 performance. This was not to be. The Congress performed as poorly in 2019 as it had in 2014. Gandhi himself lost the Amethi Lok Sabha seat, considered a Congress bastion. The continuous dip in his electoral performance in Amethi, from 2009 to 2019, raises question about his popular appeal. 2) The Congress national leadership is falling short...One of the most counter-intuitive results of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was the sharp drop in the Congress's performance in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. The 2018 assembly election results, when extrapolated into Lok Sabha seats, would have meant 12 seats in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and 10 seats in Chhattisgarh for the party. In the 2019 elections, the Congress could win only two Lok Sabha seats in Chhattisgarh and one in Madhya Pradesh. It failed to win even one seat in Rajasthan. A pre-2019 results analysis by Gilles Verniers of Ashoka University found that in 80% of the cases, the party that won the state election went on to win the state in the following general elections. In other words, the Congress went against the trend by performing badly in these three states. To be sure, the BJP has enjoyed an additional vote share in national elections in both 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This is widely attributed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity. There is a yearning within the Congress, and the entire Opposition, for a leader who can match Modi's appeal. This is the root of the despondency in the opposition ranks. The Congress leadership has failed to live up to this challenge. 3) Central and state units appear out of sync...At a time when the entire Opposition, including the Congress, is finding it difficult to match Modi's national appeal, the party's national leadership could have adopted a more participative style of functioning to attack the government, both within and outside Parliament. This is being rendered difficult because of a growing asymmetry in the Congress's support base and national leadership. In the 2019 elections, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra contributed almost half (44.5%) of the Congress's total votes. The share of these states in the party's total Lok Sabha MPs was just 5.8%. The 2019 scenario looks drastically different from 1984, when there was an almost perfect correlation between share of states in the Congress's votes and seats. If big support bases of the party do not find a reflection of their concerns in the national strategy, unrest and despondency are bound to grow. 4) Shrinking footprint limiting the ability to accommodate personal ambitions...Organisational leadership of a party is not just about leading interparty competition. It also involves the delicate task of managing intraparty conflicts, factionalism, and personal ambition of leaders. The Congress is facing a huge crisis on this front. In Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, the party lost state governments due to internal issues. In Rajasthan, a similar crisis erupted, but has been averted for the time being. The roots of these ruptures are the same -- growing differences between leaders. The all-India leadership of the party is in no position to resolve these, as it has little to offer (such as, say, a governorship, a central portfolio or even a Rajya Sabha seat). A good way to look at this is to track the decline in the number of Rajya Sabha MPs the Congress has sent to the Upper House in each decade.

 # Stewart was more than a coach in Martin | Opinion
 Brandon Shields
 Jackson Sun
 Anthony Stewart’s death is a brutal reminder of how fragile life is.
 Stewart was 50 years old and preparing for the upcoming basketball season at UT Martin, and he was also preparing for his second season coaching his son, Parker.
 While Stewart’s death won’t grab the headlines and the social media shares if a similar situation occurred at a college like the University of Kentucky or Kansas University, this one will hurt on a more personal level.
 Martin, Tenn., isn’t Lexington, Kent., or Durham, N.C.
 ESPN, Fox Sports, New York Times and Yahoo Sports aren’t clamoring around UTM the way they do the blue bloods of college basketball like Duke, North Carolina and UCLA.
 While Stewart was a local celebrity because of the position he held in the community, he was still approachable and more a part of the community of Weakley County.
 For example, if the annual Soybean Festival was in Chapel Hill, N.C., would you expect to see North Carolina coach Roy Williams getting a corn dog before going to a concert or another event? Probably not.
 But Stewart was there. He was at the Rotary and Kiwanis Club meetings. He was at church on Sunday. He was in the Mexican restaurant eating chips and salsa before getting a plate of fajitas and saying hey to people who recognized who he was and appreciated him for his work in the community.
 Not many basketball coaches spent nearly a decade in the private sector getting real world experience before deciding to get back into basketball to coach and then bringing that real world experience to the basketball court.
 That experience helped in games, but it also helped after the games.
 According to UTM Sports Information Director Ryne Rickman, there are about a dozen former UTM players who played for Stewart playing professional ball overseas. But they and all their teammates for plenty of wisdom and advice that didn’t involve a pick-and-roll or a fast break.
 They got life advice, how to budget and save money, how to thrive in the business world and how to be a quality husband and dad. The fact that his family was at every UTM game sitting right behind the Skyhawk bench is evidence of that last point.
 In an environment where the entire family needed to embrace the community so the community could embrace them back, Stewart’s family was all in with UTM. And now, they’re finding out how UTM was all in with its basketball coach and his family.
 “As tragic as this situation is for the Stewart family, it’s times like this where being in a small town atmosphere comes into play because of the town’s love for Coach Stewart and his family,” said UTM athletic director Kurt McGuffin. “I imagine they’ll need any support they can get.”
 According to Rickman, the loyal fanbase of the Skyhawks will stand with the coach’s family in their time of loss.
 “One thing about our fans is they adopt the players as they would their own kids,” Rickman said. “So they pay attention to how those guys are treated, and Coach Stewart did a great job the way he treated the players on and off the court.”

The Power Surge will see Powerplay overs split, with two overs of fielding restrictions enforced by the batting team any time after the 10th over. The X-Factor introduces the opportunity for teams to substitute a player after the 10th over of the innings, while Bash Boost introduces an extra point up for grabs – with three ladder points awarded to the winner of the match, with the additional point to be awarded to the team with the most amount of runs after 10 overs – making the halfway point of each match just as exciting as the final over.
