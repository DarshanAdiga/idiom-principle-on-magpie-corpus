The coronavirus-hit holders Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia were kicked out of the Asian Champions League on Wednesday after being unable to field a sufficient number of players against Shabab Al Ahli of the UAE.
 Al Hilal were "deemed to have withdrawn from the competition" after failing to name the required 13 players for their AFC Champions League (West) Group B match in Doha.
 The Asian Football Confederation said in a statement that under the "special rules applicable to AFC Competitions during the Covid-19 pandemic" the Saudi giants, who had already qualified for the last 16, will not be able to take any further part in the competition.
 "All matches played by Al Hilal, who named only 11 players, are considered null and void" the AFC said.
 As a result, Pakhtakor of Uzbekistan and Shabab Al Ahli Dubai progress to the Round of 16 from Group B.
 Competition regulations allowed for 35 players to be registered by each club, but Al Hilal registered 30 of which only 27 travelled to Doha in the beginning of the competition.
 Al Hilal and the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) had asked for the postponement of the match against Shabab Al Ahli Dubai, citing an AFC rule allowing for a delay "in exceptional circumstances".
 But their request was turned down as a postponement "would have a huge negative impact on the current match schedule of the AFC Champions League (West)".
 Al Hilal played Iran's Shahr Khodro on Sunday despite 15 of their players testing positive for coronavirus, after Asia's football body refused to postpone the game.
 The Saudi team had "asked the Asian Football Confederation to postpone" the match at Qatar's Al Janoub stadium after tests showed that ten players had "been infected with Covid-19", adding to five players who had already tested positive.
 According to AFC rules, Al Hilal were still able to play the match as 14 of their players were available, including two goalkeepers.
 For the record, Pakhtakor defeated Iran’s Shahr Khodro 1-0 on Wednesday and topped the group with 10 points while Shabab Al Ahli were second on seven.
 Shahr Khodro lost all their matches while Al Hilal also finished pointless following the AFC’s decision to void their results.
 Al Hilal won the title beating Uruwa Red Diamonds of Japan in the final last year.
 \- Esteghlal progress -
 Earlier, Iran's Esteghlal booked their last-16 spot with a 3-0 thrashing of Saudi Arabia's Al Ahli.
 The convincing win saw Esteghlal finish second ahead of Iraq's Al Shorta on goal difference in Group A after both teams were level on five points.
 Al Ahli had qualified for the knockouts earlier and ended up Group A winners with six points despite their defeat.
 Teams in the group played only four matches each instead of the usual six after the UAE's Al Wahda were considered withdrawn following several Covid-19 positive tests before they travelled to Qatar.
 Esteghlal required a two-goal victory margin to make the cut and they did so with some flair at the Al Janoub Stadium, one of the new venues in Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
 After a few missed chances, Mehdi Ghaedi put the Iranians ahead in the 29th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the box following a pass from Farshid Esmaeli on the left flank.
 Ghaedi, who was a constant source of menace for Al Ahli, was in the thick of the action once again in the 38th minute, but this time as provider.
 The 57kg forward sent a perfect cross from the right flank for Mehdi Karimi, who got past his marker and headed home.
 Malian forward Cheick Diabete then headied home a chip from the edge of the box by Karimi in the 54th minute.
 Al Ahli got their best chance late in the match but Esteghlal goalkeeper Sayed Hosain foiled a powerful 30-yarder from substitute Husain al-Mogahwi.

 # This island has no bridges. Can it survive with no ferries?
 By Charity Robey

 NEW YORK — Unless you have a kayak, there are only two ways on and off Shelter Island. As they have since the 19th century, the full-time residents on the small island at the very tip of Long Island rely exclusively on the North Ferry and the South Ferry.
 But the ferries increasingly were used by city dwellers trying to avoid traffic on the weekends — a tactic that treated Shelter Island basically as a bridge to the Hamptons. It may have annoyed the island’s residents, but it was a steady stream of cash to the ferry owners, both private businesses.

 # Cruise ships can’t sail, but the vessels are still a draw

 As the ferry slowly turned the corner of the Hengistbury headland off Britain’s southwest coast, the passengers on board stood up and gaped at the silhouettes of giant cruise ships moored in the distance, letting out bursts of exhilaration as the vessels came into focus.
 “What a beauty. What a sight,” one man shouted as he scuttled to the front of the boat to take a closer look. “They’re alive. They’re breathing,” said another, pointing to the plumes of smoke visible through his binoculars. “Absolutely stunning,” said a woman, her hand resting on her heart. “I just can’t wait to hop back on.”

Yet Courter said she cannot realistically consider cruising until an effective vaccine becomes available and everybody on board is inoculated.
 “I think a lot of people are in denial,” she said. “We need a full prescription that includes vaccines, rapid testing and even medication in case you get infected when you are out in the middle of the Indian Ocean.”
 Several cruise companies that resumed operations over the summer were forced to cut short their expeditions because of suspected or confirmed infections on board.
 Some European cruise operators, like the Italian line Costa, have started reduced-capacity local cruises within Italy and require all crew members and guests to be tested before they board the vessel.
 Craig Lee tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess even after two weeks of quarantine in his windowless cabin. The retired schoolteacher from Canada said he could not imagine going back on a cruise without the requirement of mandatory testing.
 “I was lucky because I was asymptomatic and did not have any problems breathing, but then you think of all the people you came into contact with during the trip, and that is very concerning,” Lee, 72, said in a telephone interview.
 When Canada lifts its travel restrictions, Lee plans to travel to England to see his relatives and then explore small cruise routes from Britain to Europe.
 “I trust the Europeans a lot more than I do the Americans right now,” he said, laughing.
 Other cruise loyalists, including those who traveled to Dorset to view the idled ships, said they trusted the operators to take all the necessary precautions in the future.
 Shannon Wright, a 45-year-old beautician, drove six hours with her family to Osmington Mills, a coastal hamlet in Dorset that offers some of the best views of the ships.
 “Nobody really knew how the virus worked at the beginning, and now that they do, I trust that they will take all the right measures,” she said.
 While the ship sightseers have been part of a tourism wave welcomed by coastal communities, some local residents worry about the ships' effect on the environment, especially in the seaside town of Weymouth, where people have noticed a new yellow smog in the atmosphere.

Bloomberg) -- One of the front-runners in Puerto Rico’s Nov. 3 gubernatorial race said he’s inclined to cancel the estimated $100 million contract that the island’s power authority recently signed to with Luma Energy, a joint venture between Quanta Services Inc. and Atco Ltd.
 In an interview with Bloomberg, Carlos Delgado Altieri said he has established a committee to review the 15-year contract that gives Luma the right to run the transmission and distribution grid, and he expects to have a list of possible changes and recommendations by the end of this month.
 “My preliminary take on the contract is that I don’t like it,” Delgado Altieri said Tuesday. “I understand that there’s room to improve it, to make it better for the people of Puerto Rico and less favorable to Luma. My inclination is to exit the contract.”
 The current administration -- and many in Washington -- see the Luma deal as a first step in fixing the island’s ailing and expensive power grid that’s controlled by the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority, one of the U.S.’s largest public utilities.
 Delgado Altieri, the mayor of the northern town of Isabela, became a front- runner in the Nov. 3 governor’s race when he beat two well-known politicians, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, to win the nomination for the Popular Democratic Party, known as the PPD. Although he has a long career in politics, he has fashioned himself as an outsider from a small municipality at the other end of the island from metropolitan San Juan.
 While he’s facing a handful of other rivals, his principal competitor will be the island’s former delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, Pedro Pierluisi, who is representing the incumbent New Progressive Party, or PNP.
 Delgado Altieri, 60, sees the island through a municipal lens and says he intends to decentralize the government, giving local mayors larger budgets and more responsibilities.He blames the PNP and the power concentrated in San Juan for creating bottlenecks that have slowed the recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017.
 Delgado said that his municipality alone has submitted 163 projects due for repairs after Maria. Of those, only six have been approved and he’s received no funding.
 “Let me be in charge of those projects and I can hire local contractors who shop at the local hardware store and inject money into the local economy,” he said of his decentralized approach. “With centralization, what we’ll have is big American companies coming in, subcontracting out the work and most of the money won’t stay in Puerto Rico.”The U.S. commonwealth of 3.2 million people has seen better days. With its economy and population in decline, the Caribbean island has been in bankruptcy proceedings since 2017, even as it has been battered by natural disasters and political instability. For the last four years governors have had to work with a federally-appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board, or FOMB, which controls the island’s purse strings.Unlike some independent candidates who say they won’t recognize the board’s authority, Delgado Altieri, said he plans to work with the body to deliver four consecutive balanced budgets -- a prerequisite to eventually dissolving the board. Even so, the Puerto Rican government needs to play a larger role in debt negotiations that the board is spearheading in U.S. court, he said.
 “I will not be submissive to the board’s whims, but we have to work with them to balance the budget,” he said. “That’s just reality. We need to work with the board.”The PNP and PPD have dominated Puerto Rico’s politics for decades and their most stark difference comes down to the island’s political status. The PNP favors statehood and Governor Wanda Vazquez has called for a non- binding referendum on that issue to be held on election day.
 Delgado Altieri and the PPD are advocates for improving the current commonwealth status and say the referendum is an empty gesture because the U.S. Congress has no intention of making the island the 51st state.
 The rival PNP “is trying to distract voters and turn the elections into a plebiscite that has nothing to do with reality,” he said. “The issue of our status will not be resolved during the next four-year administration. We have to focus on our own issues.”The Nov. 3 election will be the first time that voters will get to choose a leader after mass protests helped drive Governor Ricardo Rossello out of office in August 2019.
 Delgado Altieri said the spirit of those protests cleared the way for someone like him.
 “I think the country is looking for someone who’s not a traditional politician,” he said, “and has experience as an administrator.”

“One day I noticed some of the most famous cruise ships anchored right here in my back garden, and I just wanted to give people the rare opportunity to see them close up,” Derham said as he steered his boat toward the vessels. “It’s really a unique, spectacular sight.”
 As he pulled up closer to the 225,282-ton Allure of the Seas, the 24 ferry passengers, suddenly dwarfed by the giant blue hull of the ship, lined up to take selfies as if they had just spotted a celebrity. The 6,780-person vessel, operated by Royal Caribbean International, is known to be one of the largest and liveliest ships in the world, but on this day it appeared eerily empty with its lights out and curtains drawn.
 The cruise fans did not allow the atmosphere to dampen their spirits. For many of them, the tour was a way to relive past excursions, when the ships were filled with music, bright lights, bustling restaurants and people sprawled out across the lido decks.
 “It’s like taking your own hotel with you wherever you want to go, without any hassle of changing rooms and luggage,” said Victor Francisco, a fashion salesman, who had been hoping to get a glimpse of the P&O-operated Aurora on the tour. He had booked it for a December cruise, before it was canceled.
 “It’s also so much more than that,” he continued. “You get to have these really special experiences like dressing for dinners and cocktail parties with the captain and attending lectures with maritime historians. But the best part is the inner peace and pleasure you get from being out at sea and away from everything.”
 Some 30 million people sailed on a cruise last year, helping the $150 billion cruise industry to continue its record growth over the last decade. But now most of the nearly 350 vessels operated by major cruise companies worldwide are idle in open waters or docked at ports.
 A no-sail order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all U.S. cruises is in place until Sept. 30. In most European countries, cruises remain restricted until local authorities deem it safe to resume operations. Industry officials remain optimistic that cruising will bounce back, but the unpredictability of the pandemic is forcing many companies to consider what to do with fleets should the financial challenges become untenable.
