Yes. Thanks, Chad. So yes, so with the human challenge study, the primary readout is look for reduction in viral load in the blood post [ph] challenge. And as you said, historically when we looked at model we thought that the window of opportunity to really see a decline was too stringent for a vaccine and that you only have a few days post challenge to really see an effect over and above placebo treated volunteers. But again, as I said in the presentation, sometimes you have to put your hands up and say you're wrong because J&J came out and published results of their human challenge study at a Congress. I think it was last year where they show that they're at 26 candidate did significantly reduce the viral load in the blood. Another secondary measure is to measure the score of symptoms and there they also saw a significant impact.

Born and raised on the south side of Chicago by my single mother nothing has ever come easy. I’ve had to work hard for everything that I have now. I am grateful for having grown up in a household knowing who God was and being able to test my faith on my own as an adult has taught me invaluable lessons. I never thought I was going to go to college. But I graduated high school and went on to college to play football, after playing for a couple years I transferred to UW-Eau Claire to continue my football career. There, at UW-EC is where I quickly learned that my drive and passion was no longer for football but for academics. I left the football team and focused solely on academics, graduating with my Bachelors in Sociology and going on to complete my Masters in Higher Education-Professional Development is to date my biggest accomplishment; and for that I am proud of myself. Throughout my higher education journey I have had the opportunity to assist and start programs, like Black Male Empowerment at UWEC, creating a culture for African American males to have a voice, but mold them into better men. In May of 2018 we had the opportunity of going to London/Paris for 21 days to conduct research. Currently, I have started my own business called the Power of Perception (Est. Feb. 2020) geared creating mentoring chapters for African American/ Biracial youth in rural/inner city communities in the 6th-12 grade. I have partnered with the Eau Claire Area School District with chartering the first chapter of P.O.P., along with the Boys and Girls Club of the Greater Chippewa Valley area and Chippewa Falls School District.

Any game that is based on possession and playing out from the back is going to be thwart with issues and, therefore, will come unstuck every so often.


  Leicester came to Elland Road and did a job on Leeds, but they play a similar style and are ultimately better at doing so with better players.


  Results like that are going to happen - Bielsa will see his side ship four goals in a game several more times before the season is up, there's no doubt about that.


  But the process will always be paramount, which is why so many players from last season remain.


  The team that earned an admirable draw against Manchester City featured just one summer signing while the XI that beat Aston Villa only included two new faces.


  Bielsa has gone with a simple strategy that is based on winning more than they will lose, playing the same way every time.


  The manner of their wins, such as the one at Villa Park, mean plaudits come flying in.


  Whilst the nature of their losses, such as the one at Selhurst Park, mean the cynics can't raise their voice quick enough.

For the first time in a model from the BMW Group, there is the option of integrating speakers into the seat structure. Meanwhile, the hexagonally shaped steering wheel (making its debut in a BMW), a rocker switch for gear selection and the BMW Curved Display that forms part of the next-generation BMW Operating System clearly advertise the futuristic form of driving pleasure on offer. The BMW Curved Display is held in place by a supporting structure that is concealed from the occupants’ view, so it appears to be standing freely in the cockpit. This new technology takes the traditional driver focus of a BMW cockpit to the next level, uniting the 12.3-inch instrument cluster and 14.9-inch Control Display to form a single unit that curves towards the driver.

At the end of the story, if you think about it, you need the CDC protocol, you need an extraction system, you need just a PCR instrument to do a PCR test, right.

Rev Rank: John Mulaney delivers a solid performance on his fourth SNL
 The funniest thing about this skit, for me, was Pete Davidson coming out dressed as Count Chocula from the General Mills seasonal cereal. The business executives end up firing Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben and Count Chocula and keep the Allstate Guy.
 Another good sketch to watch is “DC Morning” which involves a highspeed chase similar to the one with O.J. Simpson, except Trump is in the back seat of the white Bronco, and his son, Don Jr., is the getaway driver. My other favorite was “Hailstorm,” which was not political at all and therefore a little refreshing.
 Overall, I really liked this episode. I didn’t think I would because I usually don’t like political sketches, but I think everyone needed a good laugh after this election. I liked the cameos from other actors and past cast members, too. I think Chappelle did a good job of hosting and was very comfortable on the stage.
 If any show can make light of the turbulent, political climate, it’s Saturday Night Live. I think it worked out perfectly that the election results came in on Saturday before the show went on air. This election was a historic one, and I think this SNL episode will go down in history, too.

"I couldn't be more excited about this year and coming back," Garza said. "Going through the process, I learned a lot, but at the end of the day, going through this team's potential, I felt like this was something I couldn't turn down and not be a part of."


  Garza was joined on the team by Baylor senior Jared Butler, Oklahoma State freshman Cade Cunningham and Illinois junior Ayo Dosunmu. Seniors Corey Kispert of Gonzaga and Arizona State's Remy Martin tied for the final spot.


  Garza was one of college basketball's dominant players as a junior, averaging 23.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game while shooting 54% from the floor. The 6-foot-11 forward was a first-team AP All-American and finished second to Dayton's Obi Toppin in national player of the year voting.


  Iowa was ranked a program-high No. 5 in the AP preseason Top 25, in large part due to Garza's decision to return.


  "He might average a point or two less, but all that kid cares about is winning," Iowa coach Fran McCaffrey said. "He's put the time in. He's not rested on his accomplishments. He's hungrier than he's ever been. There's no better example for these young guys than Luka Garza."


  Same could be said for Butler.


  A 6-3 guard, he had a strong freshman season in 2018-19 and was even better as a sophomore, averaging 16.0 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game to earn third-team AP All-America honors.


  Baylor looked like a potential Final Four team a year ago before the pandemic canceled the season, and it could be in the mix again now that Butler is back after withdrawing from the NBA draft. The Bears were No. 2 in the AP preseason poll, highest in school history.

Lastly, the full-year 2020 guidance, at 2019 exchange rates, we expect revenues to increase at around 25% and an EBITDA ratio at around 43% of revenues all at 2019 exchange rates. Please remember that DiaSorin financials are highly exposed to the U.S. dollars and even more so now that the United States represents more than 40% of the total sales of the group. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, consider that for every $0.01 movement of the dollar against the Euro, DiaSorin revenues moved by about €3.54 million on an yearly basis.

Women's professional soccer players have seen wages cut or suspended amid the coronavirus pandemic in 47% of the nations surveyed by international players' union FIFPro.


  FIFPro collected data from players' associations from 62 countries. In the survey released Wednesday, 69% of the women said that communication about the virus was poor or very poor, and 40% reported that they had received no physical or mental health support during the outbreak.


  In April, FIFPro released a report warning of COVID-19′s impact, saying it is “likely to present an almost existential threat to the women’s game if no specific considerations are given to protect the women’s football industry.”


  And indeed there were setbacks, in part because federations experienced dramatic financial consequences from canceled matches and tournaments, as well as restrictions on attendance.


  FIFA said at the height of the pandemic all but four of its 211 member federations had ceased play. The global impact of the virus on the game was estimated to be $14 billion.


  In June, the FIFA Council approved a $1.5 billion relief effort, portions of which were dedicated to women's soccer. FIFA also introduced eight new development programs for member associations in September, designed to further grow the women's game.

The Georgia football team won't be playing Saturday at Missouri, the fourth SEC game to be postponed this week due to COVID-19 concerns.


   


  The announcement came Wednesday morning from the league office.


   


  "I'm finding out about this about as fast you guys are," Georgia coach Kirby Smart said on the SEC teleconference about 20 minutes after the conference's announcement. "Mental agility is definitely the definition of 20/20 which we talked to our team about early in the season."


   


  The SEC said the game was postponed "due to combination of positive tests, contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of individuals within the Missouri football program, consistent with Southeastern Conference COVID-19 management requirements."


   


  It's uncertain if the game will be rescheduled.


   


  "Because Missouri has a game tentatively scheduled for December 12, the opportunity to reschedule the Georgia at Missouri game will need to be evaluated," the SEC said. "The rescheduling of games on the remaining SEC football schedule may include December 19 as a playing date."


   


  Missouri is playing Vanderbilt on Dec. 12. The SEC championship game is scheduled for Dec. 19 but the league may have games played with teams not in the title game.


   


  Three other SEC games were already postponed this week that involved three ranked teams due to COVID-19 concerns: LSU-No. 1 Alabama, No. 6 Texas A&M-Tennessee; and No. 21 Auburn-Mississippi State. Arkansas coach Sam Pittman will miss Saturday's game at Florida after testing positive for COVID-19.


   


  This is the second time this season that a Georgia game was affected by COVID-19 concerns. The Bulldogs' game at Kentucky was pushed back a week to Oct. 31 during what had been an open date after the SEC reshuffled games in its schedule following other games' impacted by outbreaks.


   


  "It's one of those deals that you find out, you have a plan for Plan A, you have a plan for Plan B," Smart said. "We obviously had been working that way all year, kind of saying if a game was cancelled what we would do and having a plan for it. As we found out yesterday and the day before that Missouri was having complications we've got to plan to continue to work on us and we've got plenty to work on. The good thing is we get to do some things against each other and compete. It's always better when you get to do that rather than having to work on an opponent all week."


   


  The SEC says teams must have a minimum of 53 scholarship players to play and have seven offensive linemen, four defensive linemen and one quarterback. A team could choose to play with fewer than that minimum


   


  Missouri is already scheduled to play Vanderbilt on Dec. 12, the open date on the schedule before the Dec. 19 SEC championship game.


   


  "While it is unfortunate to have multiple postponements in the same week, we began the season with the understanding interruptions to the schedule were possible and we have remained focused throughout the season on the health of everyone around our programs," SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement Tuesday. "We must remain vigilant, within our programs and in our communities, to prevent the spread of the virus and to manage activities that contribute to these interruptions."


   


  The Tigers played with 64 scholarship players at Florida on Oct. 31, but have three players suspended for the first half Saturday for their role in a fight in that game. Tigers coach Eliah Drinkwitz said Tuesday that there was one positive test Sunday and "contact tracing was significant at a position."


   


  Missouri had gone four straight weeks without a single positive test,


   


  The SEC says teams must have a minimum of 53 scholarship players to play and have seven offensive linemen, four defensive linemen and one quarterback. A team could choose to play with fewer than that minimum,


   


  "The No. 1 thing we know about this virus is it's highly contagious," Drinkwitz said Tuesday night, "so we're trying to be very smart about wrapping our arms around it and making sure there's not a reason to have to pause."


   


  Smart said Georgia had nearly completed its gameplan for Missouri.


   


  "It puts us a little ahead in regards if we get to play them at the end of the year," he said. "Again, I know the SEC is evaluating when the game will be rescheduled and that's kind of out of our hands."

SEATTLE (AP) — A major storm carrying high winds, drenching rain and heavy snow is headed for the Pacific Northwest, according to weather experts.


  The storm due to arrive at the end of the week will be the strongest seen in months, meteorologists with AccuWeather said Wednesday.


  Snow falling in the mountains in Washington state caused spin outs on highways and forced the closure of Snoqualmie Pass on Tuesday night for the first time this season. The pass was open by Wednesday morning with compact snow and ice in places.


  Rain will fall along the coast and in Seattle and Portland late Thursday morning or early Thursday afternoon, the weather service said. Some snow may fall in the Cascades, they said.


  But by Friday afternoon, the storm is expected to slam into the coasts of Washington, Oregon and Northern California, bringing heavy rain and high winds. Rain will turn to snow at higher elevations.


  “This will be the first significant snowstorm of the season for the Washington Cascades,” said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Mike Doll. “Snow levels will fall to pass level and travel on U.S. 2 and Interstate 90 could become dangerous due to the combination of heavy snow and blowing snow.”


  Wind-driven rain and blowing and drifting snow will drastically reduce visibility.


  “The concern is winds will be strong enough to down trees and power lines. Power outages are a risk for the Seattle and Portland metro areas,” Doll said.

OTTAWA - The head of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies says the rising COVID-19 case count bodes ill for prison inmates, many of whom remain under partial lockdown without adequate health care.
 A "toxic" relationship between correctional officers and inmates conflicts with guards' de facto role as caregivers during the pandemic, said Emilie Coyle.
 "They’ve compensated for the lack of ability to socially distance by locking people down in really restrictive ways, which has tremendously affected the mental health of prisoners," Coyle said in a phone interview, calling the conditions in some institutions "atrocious."
 A "deficient" health-care system is aggravated by guidance from public health officials who are not familiar with prisons, resulting in punitive restrictions that "don't equate to care," she said.
 Her advocacy group is calling on the federal government to release some offenders, as well as accused awaiting trial, so as to allow easier physical distancing behind bars, a step she says provinces have taken more readily than Ottawa.
 The federal prison population fell by only two per cent to about 13,700 between March and April, while the number of Canadians incarcerated at provincial and territorial institutions dropped by 25 per cent to roughly 18,200 between February and April, according to Statistics Canada.
 The changes came after Public Safety Minister Bill Blair asked the federal prison service and the parole board in March to consider releasing some inmates early to lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Other steps included extended parole and alternatives for those awaiting trial or sentencing.
 Coyle said federal inmates have been ensnared in a catch-22 that has prevented their release.
 “What ended up happening was they shut everything down and nobody had access to programs, and the conditions of parole or release are usually that they’ve completed their programs within the institution," she said.

Yes. And then the -- if I take the last one, it was regarding the timing of funding and is that going to influence anything? So, yes, if there's a deadline and we stop talking about COVID at some point, obviously, as I mentioned before, the whole COVID situation is fluid. It's moving, it's changing daily. As I said, I'm very, very hopeful that the number of vaccines will come through during Q1 for approval, whether that's sufficient or not, time will tell. I would say, the biggest part of the discussions that we have right now are not really with the classic funding agencies that you may imagine. It's more on the commercial side with other companies who are looking for a COVID vaccine for their own territory or for combination with other vaccines. So that tends to be where most of that time is taken right now. So I wouldn't give it a deadline. What I would repeat is that we are supporting [technical difficulty] moving through Phase 1. We will have more data, both clinical and preclinical early next year. But we will not move it forward without funding.

They started from scratch. A ragtag group that included three dozen walk-ons, former servicemen, a soccer player, basketball players and transfer students joined the few returning athletes who were not on the plane. Some returning freshmen who were not allowed to play the previous fall due to NCAA restrictions helped fill out the team.


  Ten months after the crash, in the second game of the following season, in what is still considered the biggest victory in program history, Marshall defeated Xavier, 15-13, at home by scoring a touchdown on the final play. Freshman fullback Terry Gardner caught a screen pass from Reggie Oliver and went 13 yards for the score.


  Fans stormed the field in celebration.


  Lengyel, now 86, gives talks to residents of the Maryland senior facility where he lives after showings of the film in which he is portrayed by Matthew McConaughey.


  “The Marshall people are like a fist,” Lengyel said. “They support their athletic programs, and they always did. In the time of tragedy, they came together like a fist. They believed in the program and brought it from the ashes to the glory."


  A memorial fountain on Marshall's campus is shaped like a tulip. Each rod represents one of the 75 crash victims. At a solemn ceremony every Nov. 14, the fountain is turned off. It’s turned back on every spring.


  According to the university, sculptor Harry Bertoia said it was his wish that the fountain would “commemorate the living — rather than death — on the waters of life, rising, receding, surging so as to express upward growth, immortality and eternality.”

Facebook has come under increasing pressure in this context and now releases data on its performance in tackling fake news and extremism, but there's a big problem with the data that Facebook releases. The Facebook team wants you to focus on what they have measured, not what they haven't. In a report titled "Facebook's Technocratic Reports Hide It's Failures on Abuse" writer, professor and speaker Chris Gilliard highlights that every time Facebook releases such data it's asking us to focus on all the people the company didn't harm. This is extremely odd if you think about it. After all, airlines don't publish reports saying 'this year we killed 95% less people". It would be considered unacceptable. The reason Facebook adopts this approach is to mask the fact that most extreme content or fake news goes undetected and unreported on the platform. This means that as Facebook fails to protect its users from the harmful effects of such content, it places the burden of responsibility on the user to self regulate and that's why education is currently the only way to go, and it needs to be targeted to be effective. It's adult learners where the need is most urgent.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden feels at home on Capitol Hill, but the place sure has changed since he left.


  The clubby atmosphere that Biden knew so well during his 36-year Senate career is gone, probably forever. Deal-makers are hard to find. And the election results haven't dealt him a strong hand to pursue his legislative agenda, with Democrats' poor performance in down-ballot races likely leaving them without control of Congress.


  The dynamic leaves Biden with little choice but to try to govern from the vanishing middle of a Washington that's been badly ruptured by the tumult of the last decade. With the forces of partisanship and gridlock entrenched, ending what Biden called the “grim era of demonization” could be the central challenge of his presidency — and one that could prove vexing if forces on the left and right refuse to go along.


  “There is a certain opportunity for bipartisanship, but it is all going to be deals in the middle,” said Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “What I don’t know is whether the (Democratic and Republican) parties will allow them to do that because the parties have gotten a lot more polarized.”


  While it is not settled, Biden faces a high likelihood of becoming the first Democrat in modern history to assume office without his party controlling Congress. Republicans are favored to retain control of the Senate heading into two runoff elections in Georgia in January. Democrats have already won the House.


  GOP control of the Senate would force Biden to curtail his ambitions, all but guaranteeing that big issues like climate change, immigration and expanding “Obamacare” remain mostly unaddressed.

In addition to the prospect of a vaccine or vaccines against the coronavirus, Johnson pointed to a ramp-up in testing. Last week, the government started its first citywide testing program in the northwest England city of Liverpool. It is planning more mass testing, including of university students in early December ahead of their return home for the holidays.
 “We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow,” said Johnson, who was hospitalized with COVID-19 in April. “But I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance.”
 In Wednesday's daily update, the British government also said that another 22,950 people tested positive for the virus. While the number of new cases is much higher than 24-hour statistics recorded in the summer, daily confirmed cases appear to be stabilizing, or at least, growing far more slowly.
 Because of time lags, the number of people being hospitalized and dying are expected to continue rising for weeks, even after the number of confirmed infections do start going down.
 “Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue, and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures — and the sacrifices we are all making — is seen and is reflected in the data," said Dr. Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England.
 Under the terms of the current lockdown in England, non-essential places such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, golf courses, gyms, swimming pools, entertainment venues and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, must remain closed until at least Dec. 2.

Ethyl mercaptan is a clear liquid with a distinct odor. It is an organosulfur compound with the formula CH3CH2SH. Abbreviated EtSH, it consists of an ethyl group (Et), CH3CH2, attached to a thiol group, SH. Its structure parallels that of ethanol, but with S instead of O. The odor of EtSH is infamous. Ethyl mercaptan is more volatile than ethanol due to a diminished ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Ethyl mercaptan is toxic. It occurs naturally as a minor component of petroleum, and may be added to otherwise odorless gaseous products such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to help warn of gas leaks. At these concentrations, ethyl mercaptan is not harmful.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Vanderbilt coach Jerry Stackhouse knows he has a more complete roster going into his second season. He also believes both the Commodores, along with he and his assistants, are better prepared.


  “It's great to have a look around and see that it is competitive at every spot," Stackhouse said. “From our starters to our second group to feel like we could possibly have 11 or 12 guys that contribute for us."


  Vanderbilt went 11-21 in Stackhouse's first season. The Commodores snapped a 26-game skid in SEC play in a big way, upsetting No. 18 LSU on Feb. 5. They were just 3-15 in league play but did win two of their final three games.


  Stackhouse said he and his assistants have a better understanding of teams in the Southeastern Conference. They have tape of the Commodores running Stackhouse's schemes and defense against those teams, and nobody in the SEC changed coaches this offseason during the coronavirus pandemic.


  “We have that game on tape right now with all of our foes and feel better about how we approach that going forward,” Stackhouse said.


  Senior guard DJ Harvey believes the Commodores will surprise a lot of people this season because they have a lot more weapons now than last season.

“The BMW Group is already working on the development of new vehicle concepts that will help shape the future of electric mobility. Because electric drive is not merely a technical innovation and a logical step towards greater sustainability – it also has the potential to open up a new dimension in driving pleasure,” says Martin Schuster, Head of Development E-Powertrain. This is currently being demonstrated behind closed doors by the company’s “Power BEV” experimental vehicle, as it explores the limits of the technically possible. Three fifth-generation electric motors producing a maximum system output of over 530 kW/720 hp have been fitted in a current BMW 5 Series production model. This trio of drive units were integrated without encroaching on the passenger compartment and deliver extremely dynamic longitudinal and lateral performance. The prototype is equipped with two independently controllable electric motors at the rear axle. These promise pure driving enjoyment thanks to their E‑torque vectoring function, as electric drive brings a new and richly engaging angle to the driving pleasure for which BMW is renowned.

Germany and Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos has criticized soccer authorities UEFA and FIFA for a crowded schedule, suggesting they overlook players’ interests in favor of their own.
 “At the end of the day, we players are just the puppets of FIFA and UEFA with all these additional (competitions) that are invented. Nobody is asked,” Kroos said Wednesday in a podcast called “Einfach mal Luppen” that he regularly hosts with his brother Felix Kroos, who plays for German second-division team Eintracht Braunschweig.
 Toni Kroos referred to the international Nations League tournament, which started in 2018, and plans to expand the Club World Cup to include more clubs.

LONDON (AP) — The United Kingdom on Wednesday became the fifth country in the world to record more than 50,000 coronavirus-related deaths, a level that one of the nation's leading doctors says “should never have been reached.”
 Figures from the British government showed that 595 more people in the country died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, the highest daily number since May. The figure took the U.K.'s total death toll from the pandemic to 50,365.
 The U.K, which has the highest virus-related death toll in Europe, joins the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico in reporting more than 50,000, according to a tally maintained by Johns Hopkins University.
 The U.K.’s overall death toll is widely considered to be far higher than that as the total reported only includes those who have tested positive for the virus and doesn’t include those who died of COVID-related symptoms after 28 days.
 Like other nations in Europe, the U.K. is experiencing a resurgence of the virus and has imposed new restrictions to curb infections over the past few weeks. Though England was put under lockdown last week, the government has been criticized for having imposed it too late, a charge it also faced when it imposed a U.K.-wide lockdown in March.
 Following the news about the death toll exceeding 50,000, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. is better equipped to handle outbreaks than it was during the first wave in the spring, when the country reported more than 40,000 deaths.

Keith Donoghue has opted to forego his extraordinary partnership with Tiger Roll in Friday's Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham as he "just can't risk the journey with Covid". While Donoghue has not partnered Tiger Roll in either of his Aintree Grand National victories, the Meath jockey has become synonymous with the 'the people's horse' after a brace of wins at the Cheltenham Festival in 2018-&lsquo;19.Donoghue won't be in the saddle at Cheltenham later this week, though, as it would rule him out of action for 14 days upon his return as he attempts to continue a sparkling jumps season with 25 winners already under his belt. &ldquo;I just can't risk the journey with Covid. Being a jockey is all about momentum and I'm enjoying the best season I've had in a long time. I think I'd be stupid to jeopardise that with the potential of two weeks out of action,&quot; he said in his latest blog for .&quot;It doesn't take long to be forgotten in this game and I want to make sure I'm available for every ride I can be here in Ireland. There is also the added incentive of Coeur Sublime in the Morgana Hurdle (on Sunday) and I can't miss that opportunity either. &quot;I've worked very hard these last few months with the main goal being to be competitive in Grade One races so I'm not going to miss this chance. I think Coeur Sublime could be competitive in races like this over the season, so forging a relationship on the racecourse is very important for a jockey.&quot;Robbie Power, who is now based in the UK, will deputise in the saddle on Gordon Elliott's charge with a rematch against French star Easysland on the cards as the 10-year-old bids to turn the tables after failing in his Cross Country hat-trick bid at Cheltenham in March.Donoghue reports Tiger Roll to be in flying form and he is confident that there are more chapters to be added to his glittering racing career before the curtain eventually comes down on the Gigginstown great.&ldquo;The decision not to ride Tiger Roll this weekend was hard enough without adding in the fact that he is in really good form at home. As I've said before you know Tiger Roll is ready for action again when he starts acting wild,&quot; Donoghue added.&quot;The more kicking and bucking he does, the more you know he is coming back to himself. Yesterday I was trying to put his saddle on and he just kept running circles around me - I just couldn't actually get to him no matter how hard I tried! &quot;As frustrating as it was, I was delighted as this shows that he could well be back to his best, or at least on his way back to his prime. Last season he just went into Cheltenham without as much preparation as he needed. &quot;His injury really held him back and we had to rush him to get him ready. Hopefully he can step forward again this year and return to his absolute best. I'm not making excuses either, he was beaten by a superstar in Easysland.&quot;But when you are taking on a horse as good as him you want to be 100 per cent and we simply weren&rsquo;t. I hope the real Tiger Roll shows up on Friday, but in any case he will improve a lot for the outing and I don't think his legendary story is finished quite yet!&rdquo;

As for which mask to choose? The CDC notes that when it comes to cloth masks, multiple layers made of higher thread counts do a better job of protecting the wearer than single layers of cloth with lower thread counts.


  Dr. Scott Segal, a professor and chair of anesthesiology at Wake Forest School of Medicine, has been putting various cloth masks to the test since March. He shared this rule of thumb with NPR earlier this year: Hold up the fabric to a bright light or to the sun. He says if you can "see the light outlining the individual fibers in the fabric, it's probably not a good filter. And if you can't, it's probably going to filter better."


  (If you want more advice on choosing a mask, here's our guide.)


  In its new scientific brief, the CDC reviews the epidemiological and observational evidence on the use of masking and the spread of the coronavirus. That includes a study of 124 Beijing households where at least one person had a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19. As we've reported, when everyone in the household wore masks as a preventative measure before the infected person started showing symptoms, the risk of transmission was cut by 79%.

"It seems like we got there just in the nick of time, as our original vacuum extraction seemed to only give us workers, and we only got queens four days later, after we cracked it open," Spichiger said.
 The WSDA has been keen to find Asian giant hornet nests since the insects’ presence in the United States was first detected in December, in the Blaine area, and another of the hornets was trapped near Birch Bay in July of this year.
 At nearly 2 inches long, Asian giant hornets are the world’s largest hornets; they have a distinct orange face and dark, teardrop-shaped eyes. This intimidating appearance and the way they massacre entire beehives has earned them the moniker "murder hornets." Only a few of the giant hornets can take out 30,000 healthy honeybees in a matter of hours.
 They are an invasive species, but they seem to find the Pacific Northwest to be a hospitable new habitat, according to a recent study.
 “This is an introduced species that is not supposed to be in the Pacific Northwest or in North America at all," Spichiger said Tuesday. "They definitely compete with our native species, and as we were able to observe, they certainly can impact wasps and other stinging insects by basically eating wasp nests. And that’s going to have an impact on the ecosystem."
 He continued: "But most importantly for us, they are known predators of managed honeybees, which of course we use for pollination for many of our most important crops, and it’s just one more thing that the managed honeybees don’t need to deal with.”

Marshall captured Division I-AA national championships in 1992 and 1996 and amassed the most wins of any team in the nation in the 1990s, many of them during a step up into Division I-A under coach Bob Pruett. An athlete named Randy Moss started a journey there that would redefine what was possible in terms of speed, power and size at the wide receiver position.


  The success continues now in the Bowl Subdivision under coach Doc Holliday, who is 6-1 in bowl games and won a Conference USA championship in 2014.


  The plane crash redefined comebacks and helped shape the identity of the public university that serves 13,000 students in Huntington.


  “It’s who we are,” said athletic director Mike Hamrick, who played linebacker from 1976 to 1979. “There’s not been a comeback story like Marshall football.”


  Marshall's chartered DC-9 was returning from a game at East Carolina on Nov. 14, 1970, when it slammed into a hillside in rain and fog just short of the Huntington airport runway. The jet burst into flames, leaving a charred swath of trees. Investigators concluded that the plane was flying too low, either because of faulty altitude equipment or the pilots’ failure to read their instruments properly.


  Everyone on board perished: 36 football players, 39 coaches, school administrators, community leaders, boosters and the flight crew.

  The 6-5 guard was the first Illinois player in 20 years to lead the team in scoring as a freshman and sophomore. Dosunmu can do a little of everything on the court, averaging 16.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists while shooting 48% from the floor last season.


  Cunningham arrived in Stillwater with plenty of hype as the highest-rated recruit in school history. The athletic 6-8 guard can play the point or fill it up when he wants to, putting him at the top of numerous NBA draft boards for 2021.

  The 6-7 senior is a superb 3-point shooter (44% last season) and a good slasher to the basket. He averaged 13.9 points and 4.0 rebounds on a deep team last season and will be a key cog on a team with Final Four aspirations.

So there's a very different dynamic between the industrial assets division and the financial assets division. The reason is, in the industrial assets division, there's a fairly rapid return on capital. So even if we bought transactions for $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, generally speaking, within 45 to 60 days, we can do an auction sale because most of what we're doing on the industrial assets side is really dates certain sales. So, it's not like a brokerage where you're buying, putting on the market and waiting. We're pretty much marking the market. We're trying to be a principal and get it at the right undervalued price and then mark-the-market rapidly. So, there's a constant return of capital, and because of the recycled capital, we have enough in the short run that we don't feel intense pressure.

With this in mind, the BMW Group’s E-Drive system test rig in Munich assists with the development of new system components from day one and enables testing of any conceivable driving manoeuvre. To this end, high-dynamic dynamometers can simulate any combination of rolling, air, gradient, acceleration and inertial resistance in all manner of different conditions – driving in sun, snow, wind, rain, through a city centre or even on the Nürburgring- Nordschleife. And this can all be done every day, round the clock. The facility even allows test drives to be conducted remotely from the engineer’s home. So electric drive system development work at BMW never stands still – and it is getting faster all the time. The E-Drive system test rig plays a central role here, helped by what is arguably its most impressive feature: the ability to test parts that are not yet available in finished product form by simulating them as virtual components. Together with increased process efficiency, this serves to shorten the development time for innovations by as much as one-and-a-half years.

President-elect Joe Biden feels at home on Capitol Hill, but the place sure has changed since he left.
 The clubby atmosphere that Biden knew so well during his 36-year Senate career is gone, probably forever. Deal-makers are hard to find. And the election results haven’t dealt him a strong hand to pursue his legislative agenda, with Democrats’ poor performance in down-ballot races likely leaving them without control of Congress.
 The dynamic leaves Biden with little choice but to try to govern from the vanishing middle of a Washington that’s been badly ruptured by the tumult of the last decade. With the forces of partisanship and gridlock entrenched, ending what Biden called the “grim era of demonization” could be the central challenge of his presidency — and one that could prove vexing if forces on the left and right refuse to go along.
 “There is a certain opportunity for bipartisanship, but it is all going to be deals in the middle,” said Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “What I don’t know is whether the (Democratic and Republican) parties will allow them to do that because the parties have gotten a lot more polarized.”

We lower selling general and administrative expenses, mostly due to the discontinuation of Equity Partners at the end of last year was partially offset by slightly lower gross profit and higher compensation expense related to improve financial performance by the industrial assets division and additional headcount to underpin growth, primarily at Heritage Global Capital.

We remain focused on managing expenses, both at the corporate level and across business units, and increasingly leveraging synergies across processes and systems to drive further operational efficiencies.

The judge did not suspend Jamie as co-conservator for the time being, and instead agreed to make Bessemer Trust a co-conservator along with Jamie, with all parties agreeing to the decision in the meantime.


  On Tuesday, Britney also filed additional objections to her dad's financial report, claiming she lost nearly $309,000. Docs obtained by ET note that TriStar Sports and Entertainment Group, Spears' former management, was paid 5% commission on her gross entertainment-related income. This arrangement allegedly generated millions for TriStar, but things changed when Britney took an "indefinite work hiatus" in early 2019. In an email included in the docs, TriStar wrote to Jamie in November 2019 and said it wanted to remain on the 5% commission plan, but with a $500k annual minimum.


  Ingham claims that Britney's counsel knew nothing of this arrangement and lost $308,974.51, which is what her dad approved to be sent to TriStar for its services in 2019 as the "amount owed." Ingham calls these "radical new arrangements" and that it gave TriStar a 260% raise from the amount it would have been owed under the previous deal. He wants the money to be credited back to Britney.


  Last week, the singer's attorney filed new documents, with Britney requesting that Bessemer Trust Company be the sole conservator of her estate, and that her dad be removed.


  Documents obtained by ET stated that Britney's TriStar Sports and Entertainment Group business manager quit abruptly. The "Stronger" singer and her lawyer claimed Jamie hired Michael Kane of Miller Kaplan to serve as business manager without her knowledge or consulting her about the replacement's fees.

A “coming-of-age story about finding yourself,” Mia Lidofsky’s _Strangers_ is a warm, more lyrically earnest foil to the broader goofball “finding yourself” comedy of _Loosely Exactly Nicole_. Following queer best friends Isobel (Zoë Chao) and Cam (Meredith Hagner, _Search Party_ ) as they stumble their way into selfhood first in Los Angeles (Season 1) then in New York (Season 2), the series made an early name for itself at Sundance, but despite both that buzz and the shift from fifteen-minute mini-episodes in the first season to a traditional half-hour format in Season 2, it is still woefully overlooked outside the queer television bubble. Well, take this as your cue to break through that bubble! Season 2 ends on a big, romantic gesture of a cliffhanger; more eyes watching the women in the middle of that grand gesture stare lovingly into each other’s eyes certainly can’t hurt the show’s chances for renewal.

There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden’s lead stood at 0.28 percentage points as of Wednesday afternoon.
 Once the results from the audit are certified, the losing campaign can then request that recount, which will be performed by scanners that read and tally the votes, Raffensperger said.
 U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican who’s leading Trump’s legal efforts in Georgia, called the upcoming audit a “first step.” He noted the Trump campaign had requested a hand recount.
 “This is a victory for integrity,” Collins said. “This is a victory for transparency.”
 Collins denied that Republican demands for greater scrutiny of Georgia’s vote were politically motivated to fire up GOP voters ahead of the state’s two Senate runoffs Jan. 5.
 “Look, I don’t think anybody in their right mind would think we don’t have enough attention paid on Georgia right now,” Collins said. “I don’t think motivation or turnout is a problem in Georgia.”
 The issues Trump’s campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: problems with signatures, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost. With Biden leading Trump by wide margins in key states, none of those issues would affect the election’s outcome.
 In addition to the audit of the presidential race, Raffensperger announced that he's consolidating runoff elections. A runoff for any state races was set to be held Dec. 1, while the runoffs for the two U.S. Senate races was set for Jan. 5. Raffensperger said he's consolidating those runoffs on Jan. 5.
 The one exception is the runoff for the special election to fill the remainder of U.S. Rep. John Lewis' term. That election will still be held Dec. 1. The person who wins that election will serve for about a month before Nikema Williams, who was just elected to succeed the late Lewis, takes office.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Eta weakened again to a tropical storm Wednesday afternoon just hours after regaining hurricane strength as Florida braced for a second hit from the storm along the Gulf of Mexico coast near the heavily populated Tampa Bay region.
 The storm's maximum sustained winds decreased to around 70 mph (110 kph) off Florida's southwest coast as it moved northward. Additional weakening was expected as Eta approaches the coast.
 Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a hurricane watch for a 120-mile (193-kilometre) stretch that includes Tampa and St. Petersburg. The storm has been in the Gulf of Mexico since crossing over South Florida on Sunday.
 The Tampa Bay region is home to more than 3.5 million people across five coastal counties. No mandatory evacuations were immediately ordered but authorities began opening shelters for anyone needing them.
 Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said special care is taken at shelters to protect people from the coronavirus, such as social distancing, and suggested people bring their own masks.
 “Everything will be done to make sure all of our residents are safe," Castor said.
 The latest hurricane watch extends from Anna Maria Island, which is south of St. Petersburg, to Yankeetown.
 The forecast prompted school officials in Pinellas and Pasco counties, which includes St. Petersburg, to send students home early Wednesday. Both counties announced schools would remain closed Thursday, as did neighbouring Hillsborough County.
 The Florida Highway Patrol closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge that links Pinellas and Manatee counties because of high winds. Tampa International Airport tweeted that it would suspend operations at 3 p.m. Wednesday.
 In Pasco County, officials set up four do-it-yourself locations for people to fill sandbags. In Tampa, the Busch Gardens theme park announced it is closed Wednesday and several Veterans Day events in the area were cancelled.
 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an expanded emergency declaration to include 13 counties along or near the Gulf coast, adding them to South Florida counties. DeSantis also asked for an early emergency order from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to free resources needed to tackle the storm.
 A coronavirus testing site at Tropicana Field was also closed Wednesday.

  Control of the Senate chamber remains up in the air for the new Congress. Republicans are projected to have 50 seats, while Democrats will have 48. Two seats in Georgia will both have runoffs in January. Blunt says the 2020 election sent a strong message that the people of the country want conservative ideas in Congress.


  "They want more opportunity," said Blunt. "They want more fairness. They want a strong economy. They don't want the regulators to regulate us out of business. We want every regulation we need and not a single regulation we don't need. They'd like to see what happened in the first three years of the Trump Administration continue to happen. That's a message that we all need to pay close attention to."

The event motto is, "Building relationships, one tamale at a time." With this, the marketplace is stressing the importance of building relationships around the community, regardless of background, upbringing, culture, and the like. "We wanted to show appreciation for our community and for those working hard to keep our Redlands community safe," the marketplace says, "and we wanted to give the community a special chance to show their personal support to the peace officers, and vice versa." The marketplace, which focuses on foods from various cultures, including Mexican culture, finds that the best way to establish this goal is by filling bellies with good, authentic (and free) food and filling minds and hearts with good, authentic conversations. And tamales are no stranger to Redlands Ranch Marketplace. In fact, each end- of-year holiday season, the marketplace creates fresh tamales from scratch, from the tamale wrap to the various tamale fillings. As such, providing free tamales as a predominantly Hispanic-inspired marketplace is fitting.

Six people died after a Europe-bound rubber boat carrying 116 migrants and asylum-seekers fell apart in the central Mediterranean Sea, a Spanish humanitarian group said Wednesday.
 The Open Arms rescue ship had been searching for the boat in distress for hours before finally locating it Wednesday morning in international waters north of Libya. The NGO had just finished distributing life vests and masks to the passengers to begin transferring them to safety when the flimsy boat split in two, throwing them into cold waters.
 Rescuers pulled out 111 people, including two infants, alive and recovered five bodies. But one of the two infants, a six-month-old girl, died after being brought on board the rescue ship, Open Arms tweeted on their official account.
 Open Arms spokesperson Laura Lanuza told The AP that the NGO has asked Italian and Maltese maritime authorities for the immediate evacuation of six people in serious condition, including two babies and their mothers and a pregnant woman. Lanuza said the NGO had already rescued 88 migrants the night before and was headed to a third distress call.

A 47-year-old man has sued the Auburn Police Department and one of its officers for allegedly using excessive force during a routine drunken-driving arrest by pulling the man from his car and slamming him to the pavement, knocking him unconscious and breaking bones in his face.
 A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by city resident Khomphet Phetsadakone alleges Officer Joe Michels used excessive force during the arrest, which occurred on Sept. 9, 2019, and was captured on police car dash-camera video.
 According to the lawsuit and police reports, Michels initiated a traffic stop near 6th Street Northeast around 12:30 a.m., after purportedly watching Phetsadakone's SUV straddle the centerline following a turn.
 After stopping the car, the officer can be heard on the dashcam video repeatedly telling the driver to turn off the vehicle and asking for identification, while the driver asks why he's been pulled over. During the exchange, Michels is seen approaching the car with his handgun drawn and held down alongside his leg. He holsters his sidearm as he tells Phetsadakone that he's being audio and video recorded via a dash camera. Auburn officers do not wear body cameras.
 According to his report, Michels said he smelled "an odor of intoxicants" when he approached the car and that Phetsadakone appeared under the influence, with watery eyes and flushed features, his head bobbing up and down. Michels does not respond when the driver asks why he's been pulled over, and asks several times to see a driver's license. In his report, Michels says Phetsadakone told him "no" after the final request.
 Then, Michels tells Phetsadakone he's under arrest, although the officer never states why. Michels is seen on the video opening the car door and grabbing the driver's hand. Phetsadakone says, "Hold on. Hold on, sir," then hollers, "Oww!" as Michel applied what he described in his report as a "straight wrist twist lock" to force the driver into a position where handcuffs could be applied.

ATLANTA - Georgia’s secretary of state on Wednesday announced an audit of presidential election results that he said would be done with a full hand tally of ballots because the margin is so tight.
 Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference that his office wants the process to begin by the end of the week and he expects it to take until Nov. 20, which is the certification deadline.
 “It will be a heavy lift, but we will work with the counties to get this done in time for our state certification," Raffensperger said, flanked by local election officials on the steps of the state capitol. “We have all worked hard to bring fair and accurate counts to assure that the will of the voters is reflected in the final count and that every voter will have confidence in the outcome, whether their candidate won or lost."
 President-elect Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by more than 14,000 votes out of nearly 5 million votes in the state. Nearly all ballots have been counted, though counties have until Friday to certify their results.
 Georgia’s two U.S. senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, earlier this week called on Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to resign over unspecified claims of election mismanagement. Both face close runoff elections in January that will determine which party controls the Senate. Raffensperger said he wouldn't step down and assured the public there had been no widespread problems.
 The audit is a new requirement put in place by a law passed in 2019 that also provided for the new voting machines purchased last year. The state has chosen to do a risk-limiting audit, in which a random sample of ballots or receipts generated by voting machines are checked against results produced by vote- tallying equipment for accuracy.
 It was up to Raffensperger to choose which race to audit. He chose the presidential race and said the tight margin means that the audit will effectively result in a full hand recount.
 Asked if he chose the presidential race because of the Trump campaign's call for a hand recount, Raffensperger said, “No, we're doing this because it's really what makes the most sense with the national significance of this race and the closeness of this race.”
 For the audit, election officers will work with the paper ballots in batches, dividing them into piles for each candidate. Then they will run the piles through machines to count the number of ballots for each candidate. The scanners will not read the data on the ballots, but will simply count them.
 Chris Harvey, the elections director in the secretary of state's office, said the agency will have a call with county election officials Thursday to go over training requirements and expectations. He said counties will likely begin the audit process that afternoon or first thing Friday morning.
 Raffensperger said the process will have “plenty of oversight,” with both parties having the opportunity to observe.

"Hello, Dr. Hummel's office. Yes, of course. I understand."


  Dr. Barbara Hummel hung up the office phone with a sigh. Another patient canceling their appointment.


  Hummel's been running her Milwaukee private practice since 1995.It was her dream job, since she decided to go back to school for medicine when she was 36 years old.


  At the height of her business, she would see about 16 patients a day. But since the coronavirus pandemic, she's been lucky to see nine patients come through the door. Some days, as few as two patients have shown up.


  She is now the sole employee of her office, working as a doctor, receptionist and office manager.


  "This last year has been rough," the 77-year-old family doctor said. "My practice is technically bankrupt so I'm paying all my expenses out of my personal funds … using retirement savings."


  Hummel is not alone. Smaller physician practices like hers are struggling to stay open during the public health crisis as the coronavirus continues to strain the American health care system. A survey issued by the American Medical Association late last month found the average revenue in medical practices has dropped by 32%.


  Revenue reductions were 50% or greater for nearly 1 out of 5 physicians, according to the nationally representative survey of 3,500 physicians, administered from mid-July through August.


  "Physician practices continue to be under significant financial stress due to reductions in patient volume and revenue, in addition to higher expenses for supplies that are scarce for some physicians," said AMA President Dr. Susan R. Bailey.


  One-third of surveyed physicians said in-person visits decreased by 50% or more during the pandemic.


  Hummel says her revenue is down nearly 60% as the majority of her patients are older and afraid to leave their homes. They know the coronavirus disproportionately impacts people over the age of 70.


  Wisconsin reported more than 38,000 new cases in the week ending Sunday - setting another record for the state. Nearly 13,000 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized with more than 1,500 of them in the intensive care units.


  Hummel knows at her age she too is at higher risk for severe disease but that doesn't stop her from going to the office every day and visiting patients. Recently, she made a house call to one of her 100-year-olds to give her a flu shot in the backyard.


  "I'm concerned, I take all the precautions I can. I know that if I get COVID I'm probably at risk of being one of the fatalities but if I dwell on that I wouldn't leave my house and I can't do that," she said. "I have an obligation to be here and to help provide care for my patients and I understand that obligation."


  Many offices have turned to telemedicine. But despite an increase in virtual visits since February, the AMA survey found nearly 7 out of 10 physicians said they were still providing fewer overall visits.


  Hummel has tried to help her patients adapt to telemedicine. Most of them don't have cell phones, let alone a computer.


  "Telemedicine doesn't pay for the office overhead, not at all," she said. "And, again, most of my patients don't even have access to it so that doesn't work."


  While smaller practices struggle to break even, they're faced with additional costs. Nearly half of medical practice owners surveyed by the AMA said spending on personal protective equipment has increase 50% or moresince February.


  Thirty-six percent of physicians said acquiring more PPE was very or extremely difficult for smaller practices that lack purchasing power to compete with larger health systems.


  Before the pandemic, Hummel spent about $12 on a pack of 50 surgical masks. In the spring, that same pack of masks cost $50. When demand from bigger hospital systems overwhelmed her distributors, she resorted to buying masks from Amazon, which cost $15 to $30 per pack.


  Since Hummel began offering COVID-19 testing in the spring, she's had to buy more gowns, gloves, face shields and N95 masks. Testing doesn't bring any revenue to the office, in fact, it depletes PPE and other resources but she believes it's a service the community needs.


  "I had to scrounge," Hummel said. "I had a patient actually bring me my first N95 mask because I couldn't find it and he was a woodworker and he had four or five of them in his shop."


  Concerned for her older patients, Hummel also invested in UV-C light equipment to disinfect exam rooms during her lunch break and at the end of the day.


  She also spends more on hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. She keeps a bottle of hand sanitizer in every corner of the office and schedules 15 minutes between patients to disinfect everything in the exam room.


  The AMA argues their survey shows more economic relief is needed from Congress "as some medical practices contemplate the brink of viability, particularly smaller practices that are facing a difficult road to recovery."


  Family practices had been struggling since before the pandemic. According to AMA's Physician Practice Benchmark Surveys in 2018, 54% of physicians were working in private practices compared to 60.1% in 2012.


  But Hummel isn't giving up. She's worked in big hospitals and has no interest in returning to that type of medicine. If things don't pick up in the next year, she's considering leasing her space to another doctor and splitting expenses, or joining an independent physicians group.


  "A lot of these patients have been with me for 15 to 20 years and that's hard for them. Change is hard for some of my older patients," she said. "So, I'll stick around for as long as I can."

As the traffic increased, Bryant said the DOT began slowing traffic down around milepost 70, and the WSP supervisor made the decision to stop traffic at milepost 80. He said the decision to close the interstate in that area gave drivers the opportunity to get off the road at the Bullfrog Road exit and turn back if they chose to.


  “Everyone gets stuck in that backup between mileposts 70 and 80, because there’s really no place to turn off,” he said. “Eventually it just got worse and worse.”


  Compounding the issue, Bryant said the DOT is limited to the number of plows and operators it can use on that stretch. He said the resources of the WSP are also limited in the number of troopers they can assign to handle the spinouts and collisions. Further exacerbating the issue is the limited number of tow trucks that can assist to get vehicles off the roadway.


  “You get to the point where the supervisor just decided for safety reasons, we had to shut down the roadway,” he said. “DOT had to have a chance to treat the roads as best as possible. Crews on the other side of the pass obviously had the same issues and eventually had to close eastbound as well. I know it frustrates people, but it happens every year. This happened a lot earlier than we expected it to, but it’s just one of those things where we try our best to keep it open.”


  Bryant said the pass eventually reopened around 10 p.m. after DOT crews had a chance to improve safety conditions.


  “Is this is going to show us what things are going to come, I don’t know,” he said. “I hope maybe it woke up those that travel back and forth a bit to put on their good tires and slow down.”

Yes owner and chairman Andrea Radrizzani has spoken about his ambition of guiding Leeds into Europe, but make no mistake, this year's remit is survival.


  Bielsa's principles means survival should be achieved in a more attractive way than we are used to seeing, but consolidation is consolidation.


  Anyone who watched Leeds over the past two years knew there would be no compromising on the playing style.


  And anyone who thought differently would've realised their error within the first 15 minutes of the team's season opener at Anfield.


  We got our first glimpse into how Leeds would perform against top tier opposition when they played Arsenal in the FA Cup back in January where they performed admirably, even causing some to question who was the Premier League side.


  But eight games into the season and results have been mixed, there's no doubting that, but sitting 15th with 10 points is by no means a disastrous start.


  Yet there is a perception that Leeds are set to play the vast majority of teams off the park en route to a top half finish.

And by the same token, the positioning is specific because there are a lot of point of care antigen test available out there that have been deployed in different settings to be used. These products, which is a high throughput, and is actually run on our LIAISON platform has a better clinical performance than some of these rapid antigen testing and that these comes without saying because the technology, the chemiluminescence technologies are much powerful technology than this laminar flow. It guarantees traceability, which is something that some of the laminar flow point operators don't do today. And this is key in my opinion. So increased sensitivity and traceability is very relevant in order to allow the identification of asymptomatic carriers, you know that today for diagnostic there are fundamentally two uses, one the swab molecular testing is used more for clinical identification and for diagnosis and to release patients to guarantee that they're not infectious any longer whereas the antigen testing would be -- the use of it would be a widespread use in the community to identify hotspots and asymptomatic carriers.

It's the one major award that has continued to elude the Miami Marlins.


  Over the franchise's 28-year history, the Marlins have never had a player win the Cy Young Award. They've come close before, with Dontrelle Willis in 2005 and Kevin Brown in 1996 finishing as runners-up and Jose Fernandez placing third in 2013, but the hardware never made its way to South Florida.


  Their chances of contending in 2020's shortened season became obsolete when their ace was sidelined as part of the early season COVID-19 outbreak and their one pitcher to make every scheduled start had back-to-back rough outings in early September.


  One of the Cincinnati Reds' Trevor Bauer, Chicago Cubs' Yu Darvish and New York Mets' Jacob deGrom will be announced Wednesday night as the National League's winner for this season.


  But with starting pitching as the backbone of the Marlins' roster, can Miami have a contender for the Cy Young Award in 2021 as they look to build on last season's playoff run and try to turn the corner in Year 4 of their rebuild under the Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter ownership group?

“They put these bodies on the stretchers that you couldn’t believe with your own eyes,” he said. “They weighed 80 or 90 pounds and they were too weak to speak. They just looked at you. I tried to comfort them and tell them ‘we’re Americans and you’re safe.’ But some of them never made it through the doors of the hospital before they died. It was the most horrible thing I’ve ever witnessed.”


  Tauber had originally tried to enlist in the Army after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, but he was rejected due to partial color blindness. But as the need for soldiers grew, he was drafted in 1944 and sent by the Army to a technical training program in Cincinnati. Then as the war in Europe intensified, he was called up to fight in the 94th Cavalry, 14th Armored Division of Gen. Patton’s Second Army.


  With his cavalry unit, Tauber fought his way north to France’s Alsace- Lorraine region and beyond. Under a crescent moon on New Year’s Eve 1944, they took part in what would become known as the Battle of the Bulge. It was so dark that night, he couldn’t tell who he was shooting at, except by the shape of the men’s helmets. His Thompson submachine gun was no match for the German tanks.


  “We had 37-millimeter cannons, but it was like throwing ping-pong balls at their Tiger tanks,” said Tauber, whose left arm was badly injured that night. He self-administered morphine, was strapped into a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and he walked through the snow to an aid station 1.5 miles away.


  He was in Bavaria when the European war ended and was waiting for orders to ship out to Japan for a land invasion when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs and Japan surrendered. Tauber said he was grateful to see the end of a war he had grown to hate.


  “It’s the worst possible way to settle differences,” he said. “You kill people you don’t even know, who may have the same background and family ideas you have but they were possibly also drafted. It’s a terrible way to solve problems.”


  After the war, Tauber used the GI Bill to earn an electrical engineering degree at the University of California, Berkeley. Then he moved to Los Angeles where he spent many years engineering circuits and technology for the fast- growing television industry. In the meantime, he married and had two children, Daniel and Jenna. Because Daniel had severe asthma that was agitated by the smog in L.A., Tauber moved his family in 1969 to Pacific Beach, which was then known for its clean air.

“Trovo incredibile che sul sito del Governo, nella sezione FAQ, alla domanda se sia con sentito svolgere assemblee di condominio in presenza venga risposto di sì, senza alcuna distinzione tra zone gialle, arancioni e rosse. E’ evidente che non si sia minimamente pensato a tutte le criticità e contrazione di diritti che una risposta del genere crea. Per quanto si possano bonificare i locali e mantenere le distanze ad esempio è impossibile assicurare una garanzia sufficiente che essi siano Covid free vista anche la durata dell’incontro e i toni in cui spesso degenera il dibattito in questo tipo di assemblee. Vi è poi la questione di proprietari che abitino in un’altra regione e che sarebbero magari essere spinti, di fronte alla convoca di un’assemblea, a doversi spostare da una zona gialla ad una rossa. Ecco quindi che questa lettura del dpcm sulla possibilità di convocare assemblee pare in palese contrasto con la ratio dei sacrifici richiesti ai cittadini: o esiste o non esiste un problema di salute e di contagio; se esiste - e il dpcm pare confermarlo negando la possibilità di effettuare convegni e incontri assembleari in Italia - non è possibile mettere a rischio la vita delle persone.

While it is not settled, Biden faces a high likelihood of becoming the first Democrat in modern history to assume office without his party controlling Congress. Republicans are favored to retain control of the Senate heading into two runoff elections in Georgia in January. Democrats have already won the House.
 GOP control of the Senate would force Biden to curtail his ambitions, all but guaranteeing that big issues like climate change, immigration and expanding “Obamacare” remain mostly unaddressed.
 But it would also create space for a different kind of legislative agenda — one founded on bipartisanship and consensus that would seem to play to Biden’s strengths. And some lawmakers say voters made clear in the election that governance from the middle is exactly what they want.
 Among them is Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who emerged from a brutal reelection campaign empowered to pursue a brand of pragmatic centrism that was once common among lawmakers but is now quite rare.

Desde el 15 de octubre -y hasta este fin de semana-, el equipo nacional se aloja en una casa frente a la playa Rocky Point y se va moviendo de acuerdo donde están las olas que más convienen para su preparación. Fueron a las míticas Pipeline, Sunset y Off the Wall, también a Haleiwa, Beach Park, Moster Mash, Lani y Chameleon, entre otras… “La mejor época de olas está comenzando justo ahora, pero igual agarramos buenas condiciones, entre uno y tres metros, aunque la idea fue buscar spots no tan concurridos y con olas más largas para hacer maniobras. Por eso nos hemos quedado bastante en Rocky Point, por la cercanía y por ser muy constante, aunque también hemos metido algunos tubos”, informa Santi, quien puntualiza que una de las claves en Hawaii es la paciencia por la cantidad de gente que hay en el agua. “Es una batalla por cada ola y podés estar 30 minutos para agarrar una muy buena, aunque es verdad que esta vez nos encontramos con muchos locales y pocos extranjeros. Por suerte los hawaianos nos conocen y no se han sentido invadidos”, agrega.

A leading witness retracted Wednesday allegations that former French president Nicolas Sarkozy took millions in cash from Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi for his 2007 election campaign.


  French-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, had claimed he delivered suitcases carrying a total of five million euros from Tripoli to Sarkozy's chief of staff in 2006 and 2007.


  The ex-president jumped on the first reports from BFM TV and Paris Match saying: "The truth is out at last."


  "For seven and a half years, the investigation has not discovered the slightest proof of any illegal financing whatsoever," he posted on Facebook.


  "The chief accuser recognises his lies," Sarkozy added. "He never gave me money, there was never illegal financing of my capaign in 2007."


  Takieddine, who is in Beirut on the run from French justice in another shady financing affair, put out a video saying the instructing magistrate had twisted his words.


  "I am saying loud and clear the magistrate ... really wanted to turn it the way he wanted and make me say things which are totally contradictory to what I said," the 70-year-old said.


  "There was no financing of Sarkozy's presidential campaign," he added.


  Sarkozy announced he would instruct his lawyers to seek to halt the case against him and sue Takieddine for defamation.


  French prosecutors last month said they had charged Sarkozy for "membership in a criminal conspiracy" after more than 40 hours of questioning over four days, prosecutors told AFP.


  It adds to charges already filed in 2018 of "accepting bribes," "benefitting from embezzled public funds" and "illegal campaign financing".


  The October charge was seen to increase the chance of a trial for Sarkozy, who was already poised to become the first former French president in the dock on corruption charges.


  Prosecutors suspected that Sarkozy and his associates received tens of millions of euros from Kadhafi's regime to help finance his election bid.


  \- Litany of legal woes -


  Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied wrongdoing.


  He has been under pressure since 2012, when the investigative website Mediapart published a document purporting to show that Kadhafi agreed to give Sarkozy up to 50 million euros ($59 million at current rates).


  But four years later, in 2011, Sarkozy was a driving force behind the international military invention that drove Kadhafi from power.


  A trained lawyer, Sarkozy has fought the claims of Libya cash by citing presidential immunity, and arguing there is no legal basis in France for prosecuting someone for misusing funds from a foreign country.


  He has faced a litany of legal woes since leaving office, including charges relating to fake invoices orchestrated by executives of the Bygmalion public relations firm to mask overspending on his failed 2012 re-election campaign.


  In a third case, Sarkozy faces charges of trying to obtain classified information from a judge on an inquiry into claims that he accepted illicit payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign.


  Sarkozy was cleared over the Bettencourt allegations in 2013.

The docs also state that Jamie notified Britney's attorney of the change, however "Ingham complained of lack of notice." But as he is not a co- conservator of the estate, Jamie isn't "obligated" to give him or Britney notice of TriStar's resignation. "TriStar was engaged by Mr. Spears as Conservator of the Estate and properly tendered its resignation to him," the docs state.


  Meanwhile, Jamie claims that the only "real danger" to Britney's estate is having him removed and Bessemer Trust as the sole conservator, as "no one with the institutional knowledge that Mr. Spears possesses from his 12 years of serving as the Conservator of the estate."


  "No one loves Britney as much as Mr. Spears loves his daughter. He wants his daughter to be happy, healthy, protected, and thriving," the docs read. "His love for Britney is a material factor in how he has been able to turn her estate around from being in the red to what it is now."


  Britney first asked the court to appoint Bessemer Trust Company to serve as conservator of her estate in August, in a further attempt to remove her father as the sole conservator. Britney's mom, Lynne Spears, has also backed Bessemer Trust Company to serve as conservator over her daughter's estate.


  Last week, Britney had a small victory when her petition request was granted that would allow her to expand her legal team. She was not present for the latest hearing, though her mother, Lynne Spears, her attorney and her dad were present.
