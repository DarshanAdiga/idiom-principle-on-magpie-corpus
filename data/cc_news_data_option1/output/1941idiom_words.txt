"Should annexation be advanced, the majority of American Jews who oppose such a policy will feel more alienated from Israel as a result. Just as we expect that our own government focus on the crisis at hand without using the fear and uncertainty felt by Americans to push through harmful and unrelated policies, we ask that the leaders of the Jewish state to which we are all so committed do the same," it added.

Israel has been engaged in incremental, de facto annexation since its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War. The establishment of Israeli settlements – illegal under international law – constituted an early step in a systematic annexation plan of the West Bank and east Jerusalem.

With “normalization” beginning in many countries around the world, a debate has begun over whether we are ready to start the process or whether it is still too early. Every country is adopting normalization through different phases and steps. Many argue that it will take at least six months to complete the process. Of course, there are two potential issues.

This annexation has not only occurred intentionally but through long-term gradual efforts by politicians and settlers to transform reality. It also happens organically, in the minds of Israelis and even of Palestinians and international observers as a result of the passage of time.

The foreign policy establishment in the U.S. is also responding. Colin Kahl formerly of the Barack Obama administration commented: &quot;Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s growing concern that the right-wing in Israel will push for annexation, perceiving a shrinking window to do so. Doing so would be profoundly unjust, costly and dangerous. It would also jeopardize bipartisan U.S. support for Israel.&quot;

The U.S. proposal is not a legal and viable means to achieve peace. Only a resolution based on two states for two peoples, with a defensible border, Jerusalem as both states’ capital and an agreed-upon solution on the refugee issue can bring about an end to the violent conflict and increasingly anti- democratic reality that has persisted for decades.

Scientists argue that especially the emergence of COVID-19 during the influenza season could make the disease harder to contain and would put greater stress on the health care industry. Considering that there is no vaccine or medication for the disease at this point, we face a high-risk situation in the future.

“As strong supporters of Israel and the United States-Israel relationship, we are deeply concerned by reports that the coalition government being formed in Israel intends to move forward with unilateral annexation of West Bank territory. This runs counter to decades of bipartisan U.S. foreign policy and to the will of the House of Representatives as recently expressed in H.Res.326, which opposes unilateral annexation and explicitly warns against the dangers of such an effort for peace in the region and Israel’s security.”

The statement also furthered that “amidst the current global health pandemic and financial crisis, we urge all parties involved in the formation of a new government not to create an additional crisis by agreeing to move forward with unilateral annexation, the effects of which could yield additional catastrophic consequences for all parties in the region and beyond.”

Novik lamented that annexation has gone from “the whims of a messianic minority” a few years ago to being all but Israeli policy. “It’s unbelievable.” And even limited annexation “will end almost inevitably with us controlling the entire territory and the 2.6 million Palestinians.”

The annexation of large swaths of the occupied West Bank, with the full support of the U.S. government, will constitute a paradigm shift for those who have been fighting for a two-state solution. Liberal Zionist organizations – from J Street to the Israel Policy Forum (IPF) to Americans for Peace Now (APN) to the New Israel Fund (NIF) – have long worked toward realizing the vision of Israel as a democratic state with a Jewish demographic majority and defined borders, separated from the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. They are now faced with the imminent annexation of the West Bank and are grappling with how to respond.

Now amid the COVID-19 crisis, we have seen that the same level of forgetfulness may generate high risks for people&#39;s lives even before the end of the pandemic. The normalization process can bring about this forgetfulness between the waves of COVID-19, which would pave the way for the prolongation of the crisis and the loss of more lives. During the process of normalization, everybody needs to keep their memory fresh about what happened in the last three months and what can happen in the future.

Annexation is defined in international law as a unilateral action in which a state incorporates territory into its domain by proclaiming sovereignty over it. The annexation of a territory acquired through war is impermissible under international law, and instances of such forceful, unilateral annexation have been soundly condemned by the international community, as Israel’s annexation of east Jerusalem in 1980 and the Golan Heights in 1981 were denounced internationally, including by United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Trump’ plan which will exacerbate and entrench conflict rather than resolve it, gives the Palestinians a fractured, multi-enclave entity while allowing Israel to annex approximately 30% of the West Bank, granting Palestinians territory equivalent to 14% of the West Bank, primarily from the Negev desert, which is located dozens of kilometers from the Gaza Strip. These territories, due to their vast distance from the future Palestinian state’s infrastructure and population centers, do not meet Palestinians’ genuine needs for land with potential for future development, thus harming the state’s prospects for stability and sustainability. In effect, the land of the future Palestinian state is equivalent to a mere 84% of the Palestinian territories as per the pre-1967 lines.

During 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first years in office, there was an increase both in systematic annexations and attempts to make the leap to formal legal annexation.

This process has been emboldened by the Trump administration’s unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

These two issues demonstrate that we have to be careful not to forget the last two months that we spent in quarantine or self-isolation in our homes. The studies on pandemics and epidemics demonstrate that forgetting the previous outbreak is one of the most significant factors in the high casualty numbers. People tend to take steps to protect themselves from the outbreak when it happens; however, they tend to forget about it once the wave of the epidemic has passed. They usually forget the lessons they learned during the difficult days of the outbreak.
