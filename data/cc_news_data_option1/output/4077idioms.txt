The question of whether the local church is essential should not be answered by the state. That is outside their jurisdiction. The first amendment of our country’s great constitution makes this clear, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” American citizens have the right to peaceably assemble, especially if it is for religious reasons.      Why have Christians in California forgotten this? I think it is because the government told us that this strain of the virus was going to be so bad we would have no choice but to add a temporary amendment to the first amendment. The governor did this by executive order during a state of emergency. He told us “the right thing to do” was to shelter in place, indefinitely. The only reason the governor’s orders continue to keep Christians from freely gathering is because people are willingly enforcing it even though it will never become law. This should not be a surprise. The governor was very careful about the way he worded Executive Order N-33-20. He asked the CDPH to define what was essential and when interviewed about lifting the order he said, “We are going to do the right thing, not judged by politics, not judged by protests, but by science.”      How interesting. How shrewd. He is going to let science be the judge for when people can return to work in local churches. Actually, N-33-20 does not only apply to those working in churches. It also applies to those who are attending churches. The governor would like people to think that “science” has the authority to tell Christians to stop going to church. How curious. Who is on the board of “science”? Where can I talk to the all-knowing leader of this great institution? Can you pull back the curtain and let us see who is behind this great artifice?      The governor doesn’t want us to recognize that science is fallible. He doesn’t want us to realize that science does not have a consensus on COVID-19. Science has a limited scope. Science has a limited jurisdiction. It does not get to tell churches whether to meet. That is what God gets to do. The church is under His jurisdiction.      And what a glorious jurisdiction it is! Jesus said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore and make disciples of all the nations.” (Matthew 28:18-19) When Christians in California decide it is time to freely worship, then the governor’s overreach of churches will come to an end. His tactic of using social pressure to keep churches closed will begin to crumble and it will become clear that the courts can not enforce executive orders that undermine this country’s constitution. Jesus Christ is Lord of the local church. He brings each one into existence and only He gets to decide when they stop being essential.

The question now is where do the Yankees and Sanchez go from here? Sanchez is still only 27 and he's a two-time All-Star, and he is under team control as an arbitration-eligible player through 2022. His trade value is way down at this point. Other teams would happily take him for pennies on the dollar, but Sanchez isn't going to headline a package for an impact starter right now.
 Three years ago the Dodgers benched starting catcher Yasmani Grandal in the postseason -- he started two of their 15 postseason games in 2017 (Austin Barnes started the other 13) -- then Grandal came back, had a career year in 2018, and was their starter in the postseason. A postseason benching doesn't always mean the two sides will go their separate ways.
 How strained is the relationship between the Yankees and Sanchez? Both sides have said all the right things publicly but we don't know how everyone feels behind closed doors. Sanchez may feel he needs a fresh start, the Yankees may feel they need a more steady presence behind the plate, so on and so forth. The catcher position is very much up in the air right now.

 The Missouri Tigers' offense stole the show all day Saturday against LSU. But with the game on the line, it was the Mizzou defense that stood strong on the goal line to preserve a 45-41 stunner over the reigning national champs.
 It was the first win of MU coach Eliah Drinkwitz's tenure in Columbia. And it was an upset for the ages.
 Mizzou was shorthanded as can be, missing starters on both sides of the ball because of COVID-19 and injuries. But Drinkwitz's Tigers gave LSU all it could handle in a shootout between high-powered offenses.
 Wide receivers Damon Hazelton and Keke Chism didn't play because of COVID-19 considerations. Defensive linemen Kobie Whiteside (right leg) and Darius Robinson (right knee) missed Saturday's game, too. Other rotational pieces, like Dominic Gicinto, Stacy Brown and Akiel Byers, were also unavailable because of the virus.
 Mizzou was led by quarterback Connor Bazelak, who had easily the best game of his career. It started with his first career touchdown pass and snowballed into an incredible performance. The redshirt freshman threw 29 for 34 for 406 yards and four touchdowns in his second career start.

 Oct 8 (Reuters) - Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel said he hopes to see Michael Schumacher's son Mick racing in Formula One next year after the young German makes his practice debut at the Nuerburgring on Friday.
 Schumacher, 21, is leading the Formula Two championship and will take part in the first session with Alfa Romeo before handing the car back to Italian Antonio Giovinazzi for the remainder of the Eifel Grand Prix weekend.
 "He deserves his shot this weekend and hopefully we'll see him not only tomorrow but another Friday this year and then hopefully in a car in a race seat next year," Vettel told reporters on Thursday.
 "That's what I wish for him. Obviously, he's having a great season, he's leading the Formula Two championship and I hope he can seal a seat for next year."
 Vettel, in his last season with Ferrari before switching to Aston Martin (Racing Point) in 2021, grew up with the older Schumacher as his idol.
 The 33-year-old described the seven-times champion's son, a Ferrari Academy driver, as "a great kid".
 "I really like him and I'm sure he's going to go a long way and do well. So this is probably just a sort of kick-off for him," he said of the practice.
 Vettel also started his F1 career in a similar way, taking part in practice with BMW Sauber at the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.
 He made his race debut in 2007 with the Swiss team, who are now Alfa Romeo.
 Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc said cold conditions at the Nuerburgring meant it would not be the easiest of weekends for Schumacher, whose father has not been seen in public since suffering head injuries in a 2013 skiing accident.
 "Speaking to him, I think every time he tried a Formula One car it was always in the rain so it won't change much for him. It is going to be a tricky session but he doesn't have to prove anything," said the Monegasque.
 "I think he has proved everything he had to in Formula Two this season," added the 2017 Formula Two champion. (Reporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond)

And two, this is now four straight postseason disappointments since New York's new core emerged in 2017. They lost the 2017 ALCS in seven games, got crushed by the rival Red Sox in the 2018 ALDS, lost the 2019 ALCS on a walk-off homer, and lost the 2020 ALDS in five games on a late homer. The heartbreak has gotten worse each season.
 The Yankees are a regular season powerhouse that has failed time and again in the postseason, and while failure is a strong word, it is the standard the Yankees set for themselves. No one in New York considers this objectively successful 2017-20 run satisfying even though there are about 25 MLB franchises that would take that four-year run in a heartbeat.
 Where do the Yankees go from here? They're certainly good enough to contend next year with nothing more than minor tweaks this offseason, though minor tweaks may not be enough to get over the hump in the postseason. Three roster questions immediately come to mind as New York heads into the winter, plus there's a fourth question that should frame their decision-making.

Ohio’s reliably red 7th Congressional District will remain that way with Republican Bob Gibbs winning his fifth-consecutive term despite a well-funded challenge from Democrat Ken Harbaugh.

Gibbs said the nation and his district have seen unprecedented economic growth in the last two years, and the nation is “safer and stronger.”
 Challenger Ken Harbaugh said it’s too early to talk about running in 2020, but urged his volunteers to stay involved.

 Mike DeWine was outside FirstEnergy Stadium before Sunday’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs. He shook hands, took photos and heard an occasional yelp of his challenger’s name, Democrat Rich Cordray.
 “We have a few dissenters, but we would call those ‘undecided.’”
 DeWine says the response on Sunday was the most enthusiastic he’s had at a Browns game, where he can meet voters from around the state face-to-face.
 “I would ask for everyone’s vote. This is going to be a close race, but that’s to be expected in an election where there’s no incumbent governor.”
 DeWine was joined for part of the time by former Browns quarterback, Bernie Kosar.  Democrats have also brought in big names in recent weeks, and on Saturday former Vice President Joe Biden appeared at a rally in Parma Heights with almost the entire state Democratic ticket.
 DeWine plans to attend a rally featuring President Donald Trump tonight at the I-X Center, then shake hands at polling places after he votes tomorrow.

 WELLINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - New Zealand Rugby have refused to say whether they will take a financial hit from forcing a change in the Rugby Championship fixtures to ensure the All Blacks are not in isolation over the Christmas break.
 Southern hemisphere rugby's governing body SANZAAR and hosts Rugby Australia confirmed on Thursday that they had changed the fixture list and shifted the final New Zealand-Australia match from Dec. 12 to Oct. 31.
 Australia's Sydney Morning Herald reported on Wednesday that NZR would probably need to offset any loss of revenue from a changed schedule, but NZR chief executive Mark Robinson declined to even discuss it on Friday.
 "We are happy with the arrangement," Robinson told reporters on a conference call. "It's commercially sensitive but we're comfortable with it."
 Robinson refused to say what being "comfortable" with the arrangement meant, nor would he confirm if NZR, which had publicly said it projected a reduction in revenue of up to 70% this year, would suffer a further loss.
 "We have come up with something that we are happy with and are moving on," Robinson said.
 NZR had been at loggerheads with SANZAAR and Rugby Australia over the original fixture list, with the Rugby Championship scheduled from Nov. 7-Dec. 12.
 The All Blacks are subject to New Zealand's strict bio-security rules to stop the spread of the novwel coronavirus upon their return home and would have spent 14 days in isolation, leaving them away from their families for Christmas.
 NZR, the players' union and the team all said they were unhappy with that possibility and coach Ian Foster revealed that he had been confronted by at least one player who said he did not want to spend the Christmas break in isolation.
 Foster, who will name his first squad later on Friday for Sunday's Bledisloe Cup clash with Australia, welcomed the changed fixture list.
 "It's good that commonsense has won the day," he said. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Ken Ferris)

The Yankees landed the free agent bargain of the offseason two years ago when they signed DJ LeMahieu to a two-year contract worth a mere $24 million. He rewarded them with a .336/.386/.536 batting line and 8.8 WAR while playing three infield positions on the regular. Only six position players posted higher WAR than LeMahieu the last two years.
 Although the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has cut revenues and created financial uncertainty going forward, LeMahieu figures to be one of the few free agents who won't feel the squeeze this winter. He's an all-around impact player who is beloved by statheads (great exit velocities and contact rates) and scouts (tremendous instincts) alike. Even at age 32, LeMahieu is going to get paid.
 "We've communicated in the past that we're going to worry about after the season," LeMahieu told reporters, including Kristie Ackert of the _New York Daily News_, when asked about contract extension talks earlier this week.

The U.S. Supreme Court says it won’t hear a challenge to Ohio’s death penalty law in a case involving a convicted murderer and rapist from Marion.
 The Supreme Court chose not to review a ruling from the Ohio Supreme Court in April that upheld the death sentence for 54-year-old Maurice Mason. Mason’s team claimed Ohio’s death penalty law had the same problems as Florida’s, which the high court had ruled unconstitutional.
 Kort Gatterdam is Mason’s attorney, and he’s disappointed but not dissuaded.
 “It doesn’t mean they’re finding Ohio’s death penalty statute is constitutional. There may be another case down the road where they choose to hear this issue,” he said.
 The U.S. Supreme Court said the Florida law was unconstitutional because it gave judges too much authority to impose the death penalty. Ohio’s Supreme Court ruled that though a judge sentences someone to death in Ohio, that authority comes directly from the jury.

A bill that would help sexual assault survivors track their rape kits through the legal process has been pulled from consideration in the lame duck session of the legislature. Statehouse correspondent Karen Kasler reports.
 The bill was introduced in August, as rape kits were a big topic in the governor’s race. Republican Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Ryan Smith, had said the bill was a priority, but he says it was pulled because Democrats wanted to amend the bill with an elimination of the 20-year time limit on filing charges and on civil lawsuits in rape cases.
 “It’s a very emotional issue. And frankly, it’s something that we need to talk more about. And I’m willing to talk about it, and we’re willing to work on it going forward," he said. "That’s why I’m frustrated that we just stopped a very good bill from going over to the Senate and continuing the process.”
 Democrats say their amendments would have fit with this rape kits bill, and they wanted them because their bill to eliminate the 20-year statute of limitations on rape introduced in May hasn’t gotten a single hearing.

 The contenders include State Rep. Sherrie Sprenger — who could become the first woman on the board since Catherine Skiens 20 years ago — Chris Wade, Scott Bruslind and Gary Sullivan.
 The board has been composed solidly of Republicans for many years, but that also could change: Wade is a Libertarian, Bruslind is a Democrat and Sullivan is an independent.
 Board Chairman Roger Nyquist is also on the ballot, running unopposed for re- election to Position 2.

 It will be the early game on Monday night, just as it was last week when the Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs were moved back a day. This time, though, the Patriots are the home team.
 The news comes in the aftermath of another positive test for COVID-19 on the Patriots. Stephon Gilmore, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year, became the third Patriots player to contract the coronavirus.
 The Patriots conducted individual tests and no new positives were detected on Thursday. New England's team headquarters remains off limits, and the Patriots could be cleared to practice as soon as Friday afternoon, ESPN reported.

The closing minutes of Game 5 of the NBA Finals were determined at the free throw line. LeBron James made three free throws in the final three minutes, while Jimmy Butler made four in the final 47 seconds to give the Heat a season-saving victory over the Lakers. Those calls -- one on Anthony Davis, another on Markieff Morris \-- didn't sit right with Lakers coach Frank Vogel.
 "I felt two bad calls put Butler to the line," Vogel said. "That's unfortunate in a game of this magnitude. Anthony Davis has a perfect verticality. That should be a play on. The time before that, Markieff Morris has his hand on the ball, that should be a play on. They were given four free throws, and that made it an uphill battle for us. I'm very disappointed in that aspect of the game. But our group is fine. We're going to bounce back strong. We'll have a better performance in Game 6. We've got to play better for the 48 minutes leading up to that last minute."
 Does he have a point? Well, according to the league's official Last Two Minute Report ... kind of. On the two plays Vogel cites specifically, the report stands by the officiating on the floor. The Davis play is a somewhat obvious foul, as he jumps into Butler rather than maintaining pure verticality. The report calls that a foul, saying "Davis (LAL) jumps from point A to point B and initiates body contact with Butler (MIA) during his driving shot attempt." It is a foul.
 The Morris play is a bit harder to parse in real time, but it looks like a foul on first viewing. The report confirms that, saying "Morris (LAL) makes contact across Butler's (MIA) left arm after his gather."

As Ohio lawmakers prepare for the next general assembly to begin in January, House leadership is still up in the air, with two candidates who still both want to be speaker.  
 Speaker Ryan Smith is calling for Republicans to take an informal vote for the next speaker now. Smith was named speaker in June after defeating former Speaker Larry Householder in 11 rounds of voting.
 Householder was hoping candidates he backed would elect him for the new general assembly but many lost in November. Rep. Jim Butler, who supports Householder, is the caucus dean and it’s up to him to call for the speaker vote. In written statements Butler says he doesn’t think either candidate has a majority. So Butler wants both to talk it out with him to “determine a unified path forward.”
 But Smith says, in a statement, that Butler’s tactics are preventing the caucus from coming together. Smith agrees caucus affairs should stay private. But he says he “will not take part in any sort of private, back-room negotiation.”

 Stewart, who has served as a judge on the Eighth District Court of Appeals, knew it would be an uphill battle.
 “I knew that our history as a party wasn’t good with getting seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. I knew it would be additionally difficult for being a woman of color.”
 She credited her victory to hard work.
