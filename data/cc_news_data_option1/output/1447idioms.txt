Harry Kane said it would stupid to leave Tottenham now the side quickly becoming part of the Premier League's elite.


  Tottenham finished third last season and they are on track to either match that feat or even better it with the Londoners challenging for silverware this term.


  Kane - who signed a new deal in December - has helped Tottenham up to third, only a point adrift of rivals Arsenal, and the England international sees no reason for anyone to jump ship with a second successive with Champions League football on the cards.


  "I would be surprised if any of my team-mates were to leave now," said Kane.


  "Something's going on here, we're just missing that last step - to win trophies. It would be stupid to leave now.


  "We have one of the best managers in the world, perhaps the best. Soon there will be a new stadium. The future is promising."


  Kane has been lethal with 13 goals for Tottenham this term.


  Tottenham face Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup on Saturday facing strugglers Sunderland in the Premier League on Tuesday.

CHAMPAIGN -- Former NFL and Illinois linebacker Kevin Hardy has accomplished quite a lot in his life, from being an an Associated Press all-American in 1995 to being selected as the No. 2 overall pick in the 1996 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars.
 But when Hardy received the call from Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman, he thought it might be a fundraising call.
 Instead, he was surprised to hear Whitman congratulate him on being inducted to the 2020 class of the Illini Athletics Hall of Fame.
 "It doesn't matter whether you think it's going to happen or whether you know it's gonna happen," Hardy said. "It's totally different when you actually hear the words and it actually happened. And so when he called and told me that, you know, it was a real sense of pride and accomplishment, and I was really proud, you know, you're proud to hear those words."
 In the '90s at Illinois, Hardy was a standout among an elite crop of linebackers, which included 1996's No. 3 overall draft pick, Simeon Rice, who is the all-time Big Ten sack leader, and fellow all-Big Ten and future NFL linebackers Dana Howard and John Holecek.
 Hardy joins Rice (Class of 2019) and Howard (Class of 2018) as Illini Athletics Hall of Fame inductees, and is joined by linebacker/fullback Ray Nitschke (1955-57) and defensive tackle Moe Gardner (1987-90) in the Class of 2020.
 There are now 14 Illinois football inductees, and to be among that group is a distinctive honor for Hardy.
 "To be honored and mentioned with some of the greats, it's really special," Hardy said. "I'm really humbled to be part of that group."
 Hardy ranked ninth in career tackles, with 330, fourth in sacks (18) and fourth in tackles for loss (38) when he finished at Illinois in 1996.
 Just one year after Howard won the Butkus Award in 1995, Hardy won it in his final season.
 Hardy admittedly isn't one to reminisce too much, but he has a wealth of treasured memories in his storied Illinois career.
 The Illini stumbled out of the gate in 1993, starting 2-4, but rallied to upset No. 13 Michigan before finishing 5-6.
 "We beat Michigan at Michigan, which was a huge accomplishment because we hadn't beaten Michigan since I had been there," Hardy said. "And to do it on their field was pretty special."
 A year later, in 1994, in a win now famous among Illinois fans because of teammate Howard's guarantee of a victory, Hardy helped anchor the defense in a 24-10 upset of No. 17 Ohio State.
 That one was especially sweet.
 A week prior, then-ranked No. 25 Illinois had suffered a disappointing 22-16 home defeat to Purdue.
 "Coach (Lou Tepper) wasn't too happy about that," Hardy said. "But it was really special the way the guys rallied around Dana, in his belief in us and in coming out with that victory."
 That win helped power Illinois to a 7-5 campaign that finished with a blowout Liberty Bowl victory over East Carolina in Memphis.
 Despite the 30-0 scoreline, that one stands out to Hardy because it was his last time playing at the heart of the Illinois defense with teammates Howard and Holecek before they left for the NFL.
 The trio, along with Rice, helped Illinois have a legitimate claim to be "Linebacker U" in the '90s, and Hardy said both were instrumental in his development at Illinois.
 "It's kind of special to me because those two guys were the two guys that really helped me become the player that I became," Hardy said. "And so that's why that game kind of stands out for me because it was our last time playing together as the 'force': myself, Dana and John."
 After being selected second overall by the Jaguars under the shining lights at Madison Square Garden, Hardy found immediate success. His NFL career stretched nine years, from 1996 to 2004.
 As a rookie for the Jaguars, Hardy racked up 62 tackles, 5.5 sacks and two interceptions. He played there five more years, earning Pro Bowl and AP All- Pro first team honors in 1999 after a career-best 97 tackles and 10.5 sacks.
 He played four more NFL seasons, with the Dallas Cowboys and Cincinnati Bengals, before retiring after the 2004 season with career totals of 742 tackles, 36 sacks and five interceptions.
 Hardy wasn't one to be obsessed with the spotlight of stardom, and he said he didn't really realize the gravity of many of his big moments.
 "In the moment, you know, it just becomes part of your life," Hardy said. "For me, I never looked at myself as this celebrity.
 "I never looked at myself as, you know, the premier linebacker in college football in '95," he continued. "I didn't look at myself as being the second- best player in college football going into the draft in 96. You're in the moment, and you're just doing what you are doing and what you're supposed to be doing."
 Nowadays, Hardy lives back in Jacksonville with his wife, Terrie, and two sons, Langston and Camden.
 Langston is a standout linebacker and defensive end at Jacksonville Episcopal, where Hardy helps out as the defensive line coach.
 "Other than that, I'm enjoying retired life, playing golf, doing some fishing and just enjoying this good Florida weather," Hardy said.
 And every once in a while, perhaps while watching a game with his sons or while imparting some coaching advice, he allows himself some slight indulgence in nostalgia.
 "It's really cool to say like, 'Wow, I did that' or 'I was there' or, you know, 'I did that a little better than that guy,' you know, whatever it is," Hardy said. "But it really, really becomes more special the older you get, and I don't know, just because I appreciate it a lot more.
 "Just that sense of accomplishment really is special," he continued. "And I really enjoyed it. And for me now, I enjoy being able to share the stories with my kids and some of the kids that I coach. It really gives me a real sense of accomplishment."

Prior to the session, speculations have emerged that Pyongyang will use the meeting to deliver some message to the United States in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, but no such message was voiced.


  According to KCNA, the Sunday meeting was devoted to budgetary issues and appointments, including electing the country's foreign minister, Ri Son Gwon, as a member of the State Affairs Commission. At the same time, this is not believed to represent any change in the power status of Ri, who took the office of the foreign minister earlier this year, because the foreign minister has always been a member of the commissions.


  During the session, new appointments to the posts of ministers of natural resources, engineering and light industry were also announced.

Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka is keen on further attacking reinforcements during the January transfer window.
 Boro signed forward Patrick Bamford from Chelsea on a four-and-a-half year deal for a reported £6million on Wednesday, having brought in striker Rudy Gestede from Aston Villa.
 The duo will add competition for places to a shot-shy attack – Middlesbrough's return of 17 goals from 21 matches is the lowest in the top flight – ahead of West Ham's visit to the Riverside Stadium this Saturday.
 Nevertheless, Karanka is now concerned over the men providing the ammunition and has been linked with Stoke City's classy former Barcelona youngster Bojan Krkic.
 "I said always the main position I want to strengthen is the wings as the only quick player we have is Adama [Traore]," he said.
 "I want to bring another but we have two weeks. The club is working well behind the scenes and knows the players I like and would want to bring in.
 "They're not bothering me every day telling me what's happening or not, they know the players I like and when he’s here it will be perfect."
 Bamford won Championship Player of the Year two seasons ago when he scored 19 goals for Boro during an acclaimed loan spell.
 Subsequent temporary stints at Norwich City, Crystal Palace and Burnley have fallen flat and, while Karanka acknowledges he might have something of a rebuilding job on his hands, he has no doubts over the 23-year-old's ability.
 "I am really pleased Patrick Bamford is back. He's a player I like a lot and he has played his best football with us," he said.
 "The most important thing is to recover Patrick's confidence. It will be difficult for him, but I trust him. He can be as important for us as he was two years ago.
 "Patrick can play any attacking position. His best characteristic is that he is always thinking forward, which we need right now.
 "The first thing in my job is to improve players, and knowing Patrick like I do it is important."

"


  I have dedicated my life to helping and protecting people--particularly those in the Midwest. With an admiration and passion for flight, I have served in the Illinois Army National Guard, for the Department of Defense in Chicago, and as an emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter pilot. Through this experience, I have gained an understanding of the importance of aircraft for both civilians and military, and I have learned that these methods of transportation can be especially critical during emergency medical situations.


  Unfortunately, I have seen and experienced my fair share of accidents and tragic events during my tenure as an EMS helicopter pilot--gun shots, automobile crashes, ATV accidents, and other severe medical emergencies to name a few. In every instance where an air ambulance was deployed, on-the- ground emergency responders deemed them critically necessary. Typically, these patients were in such dire straits that they required immediate specialized care, often at an advanced hospital, and could not risk traveling far distances and the potential for traffic delays.


  It may seem that these emergency instances are rare and so are the use of air ambulances, but that is simply not the case. As more and more hospitals close in rural areas, these services are more common and important than ever before. In fact, it is estimated that more than 85 million Americans in rural places require helicopter services to reach a trauma center within an hour.


  Putting my profession aside, I am a resident of a rural locale. I want to ensure that my family and community have access to these increasingly important services during an emergency. Without them, we could be faced with a healthcare crisis.


  Air ambulances are quite simply the fastest, safest and most efficient way to get to a Trauma 1 or Trauma 2 Center--especially from a rural area, which could be miles or hours away. These specialty choppers are also equipped with essential medical supplies and have highly trained staff on board ready to aid a patient in need.


  While it's clear that there is a critical need for air ambulances, the companies that provide these services are in a vulnerable state. But Washington lawmakers have the opportunity to prevent these facilities from being put out of business. Lawmakers need to protect patients from surprise billing and hold insurance companies accountable. I am hopeful that Illinois lawmakers will support legislation that preserves air medical services and all their lifesaving capabilities.

 The 25-year-old Azam has emerged as Pakistan’s best batsman in recent times and currently leads the ICC men’s T20 International rankings. He is also ranked third in One-Day Internationals and fifth in Tests respectively. He is the only man apart from Kohli to feature in top 10 across all three formats.
 Azam and Kohli have drawn multiple comparisons over the recent past due to their influence of winning games single-handed for their countries but Raja feels Azam can emerge as an important player for Pakistan in the long run and go on to become better than Kohli.
 “For Babar Azam sky is the limit,” Raja was quoted as saying by a local news channel.
 “Until and unless he gets the environment which is encouraging and engaging, he won’t be able to love up to his potential. He has the potential to even beat Virat Kohli but he needs to free up [his mind] and not think about losing. As soon as he does that and thinks about scoring runs and winning, he will remain a great player for a very long time,” he added.
 Azam, had earlier downplayed comparisons between himself and Kohli, stating he was still far away from getting closer to his counterpart.
 “Look he (Kohli) has already achieved a lot. He is a legend in his country. Honestly, there is no comparison with me right now but eventually, I also want to get where he is today,” Azam had said.
 “The media and people have drawn comparisons between me and Virat Kohli but I realise that I still need to get more runs in red-ball cricket to be ranked among the top players. That is why in recent months I have been focusing a lot on getting consistent scores in Test matches.”

Implementing dynamic response interventions, which involves the cycling of on and off interventions, is an effective way to reduce the proportion of the population affected at the end of two years. The measures include social distancing, which can be eased to provide periods intended for economic and psychological relief. The measure is useful because when the team calculated the intervention being implemented by about 13 months, the average overall attack rate decreased by two percent.

Death rites, considered sacrosanct for any religion, are in serious threat of being eroded. The country’s overworked and disempowered municipal authorities are grappling with a new problem -- of performing last rites of coronavirus bodies.


  There are increasing cases of families not willing to accept bodies of coronavirus patients as the contamination levels are too high and the chances of a fatal infection nearly certain, if not handled with care. Face to face with death, religious rituals have taken a backseat. According to the latest count, more than 300 people have died due to the virus sweeping the country.


  Last week in Punjab’s Kapurthala, a son refused to accept his mother’s body for the fear of contracting the virus. Repeated requests by the _tehsildar_ and local authorities to do the final rites fell on deaf ears and it was left to the administration to do the needful, at their expense.

Hull City head coach Marco Silva said he could not be happy about his side beating Manchester United 2-1 on Thursday, as it was not enough to book a place in the EFL Cup final.


  United led 2-0 after second-half goals by Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini in the first leg at Old Trafford, but Tom Huddlestone's penalty got Hull back in the tie before half-time.


  Paul Pogba levelled for United and Oumar Niasse's late goal proved irrelevant as United progressed 3-2 on aggregate, although it sealed a third straight home victory for Hull, leaving Silva dissatisfied.


  "It was a good win but not enough for our goal," Silva said. "It is important to win the game but the result in the first leg caused problems for us.


  "It was a good performance again, a good attitude and we controlled the game in large periods against a big team.


  "It is impossible at this moment to feel really happy. The goal we conceded is not a normal goal, we lost control at the vital moment. It is important that we won the game.


  "We have won three games in a row at home and when I arrived we had won once in two months. I congratulated the players in the dressing room."


  Hull have sold Jake Livermore to West Brom and Robert Snodgrass is expected to leave the club imminently, with Silva aiming to be able to add to his squad before Tuesday's transfer deadline.


  "I hope to improve the squad with three or four players. We need them," Silva said.


  "We have 15 or 16 players, it's not normal at this level."

Paris Saint-Germain forward Jese Rodriguez has been made a firm offer by a Premier League club, according to Las Palmas president Miguel Angel Ramirez.


  The 23-year-old is expected to leave Parc des Princes before the end of the transfer window, having struggled to settle since his move from Real Madrid.


  Las Palmas have been interested in a deal for the player, who was born in the Canary Islands, but made it clear last month that they feared being priced out of a move.


  And Ramirez has suggested that a move to England's top flight is now looking likely for Jese, who has been linked with Liverpool and Middlesbrough.


  "I've been speaking with his representative and there is an English club that wants to pay everything," Ramirez was quoted as saying by Marca.


  Ramirez hopes to have more luck with fellow targets Jonathan Calleri and Hernan Toledo.


  Calleri has failed to start a Premier League match for West Ham this season, despite Slaven Bilic's side having suffered from injury problems in their forward line, while Toledo is yet to make a senior appearance for Fiorentina since arriving on loan from Deportivo Maldonado.


  "Calleri and Hernan Toledo are two interesting players," Ramirez said. "We expected a response from West Ham to make Calleri official but we've been asked for a few days."


  Las Palmas, who are only four points off LaLiga's top seven after a strong first half of the season, have also been linked with former Barcelona youngster Alen Halilovic.


  Reports in Croatia on Tuesday have claimed that the 20-year-old is close to completing a €5million transfer back to Spain's top flight.

Emirates is planning to operate limited flights to Chicago, Manila, Kabul, Jakarta, Algiers, Tunis and Taipei, in addition to flights to London and Frankfurt, according to a statement.


  The airline confirmed on Saturday that it would commence flights to several destinations following a suspension of all flights by UAE authorities on March 24 to contain the spread of the coronavirus, official known as COVID-19.


  “These services will facilitate residents and visitors wishing to return home,” the statement read, but it did not say when the flights would take place.


  As a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus, magazines and other print reading material will not be available on board, and online check in and seat selection has been suspended.


  Cabin baggage has also been limited to a laptop, handbag, briefcase, and baby items. All other baggage must be checked in, the airline said.


  “Passengers are required to apply social distancing guidelines during their journey and wear their own masks when at the airport and on board the aircraft … All Emirates aircraft will go through enhanced cleaning and disinfection processes in Dubai, after each journey,” the statement concluded.


  Earlier, the airline announced that passengers who booked a flight before May 31, 2020 for travel up to August 31, 2020 can extend the validity of their tickets for two years past the date of the original booking, according to a Tweet from the government of Dubai’s media office.

What immediately comes to mind is the culture of hand watching and greater personal hygiene. The process of digitalisation of society, increasing role of the virtual world and the development of robotics in the world of work have been on-going over the last few decades. The coronavirus pandemic is bound to accelerate these processes and our society and world of work will increasingly become digital and virtual. Corporate bodies and employees alike will recognise that many employees need not come to work in offices to be able to deliver on their job targets. Even more so, the essential drive for profits that propels capitalist industry and innovation will speed up the process of replacing human labor with robots, where feasible. This has huge implications for the world of work and workers and trade unions. This is just one example of the need for Africa and us, as Ghanaians, to think through and engage all sectors of society on how we intend to organise our societies and take conscious, informed and planned decisions going forward.

Andre Ayew's penalty was enough to take the points as Ghana got their Africa Cup of Nations campaign up and running with a 1-0 win over Uganda in Group D.
 West Ham forward Ayew converted in the 32nd minute after Isaac Isinde was adjudged to have fouled Asamoah Gyan.
 It was just reward for 2015's beaten finalists, who made their class tell and threatened to turn Uganda's first outing in the finals since 1978 into a chastening experience.
 But Milutin Sredojevic's side made an impressive fist of the second period, with influential midfielder Tony Mawejje coming the closest to finding the equaliser their efforts merited.
 Although the Black Stars were able to claim the points, Baba Rahman's fitness is a cause for concern after Schalke's on-loan Chelsea left-back suffered a potentially serious knee injury.
 Ghana boss Avram Grant opted to leave centre-back Jonathan Mensah on the bench and his defence were given something to think about in the fourth minute when Mawejje had an effort saved by Razak Brimah amid a lively start from Uganda.
 But Ghana settled and their superior quality started to shine through – Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey teeing himself up from Jordan Ayew's cutback to volley over.
 Jordan Ayew left brother Andre waiting in vain when he burst towards the byline but overhit his cross, while a more accurate centre from the impressive Christian Atsu found captain Gyan straining to head wide.
 Andre Ayew prodded tamely at Uganda goalkeeper Denis Onyango before the half- hour but he made no mistake from 12 yards after Gyan caught Isinde napping and drew contact from the centre-back.
 Ghana's progress was checked by Rahman leaving the field on a stretcher having fallen to the turf clutching his left leg.
 Isinde had the opportunity to atone for his earlier indiscretion in first-half stoppage time, only to head past the post from Farouk Miya's corner.
 Following a listless start to the second period, Uganda almost pulled level spectacularly in the 62nd minute.
 Mawejje sent a shot whistling narrowly past the top corner after Ghana failed to clear a set-piece.
 Joseph Ochaya was also off-target and Geofrey Massa drilled a free-kick into the wall as Sredojevic's side pressed for an equaliser with growing conviction.
 Ghana's earlier fluency had all but deserted them by the final 15 minutes and Standard Liege youngster Miya should have done better when he scuffed straight at Brimah.
 Daniel Amartey made vital blocks as the clock ticked down and Ghana managed to hold out - Atsu passing up the opportunity to give them breathing space on the counter-attack - although Grant must know improvements will be required against their other group rivals Mali and Egypt.

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 13th Apr, 2020) Emirates Post has opened its new international operations hub in Dubai International Airport, DXB, to provide global e-commerce, parcel and logistics brands a gateway to the UAE, KSA, and regional markets.
 In the wake of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed on regional and international travel, the postal, parcel and logistics industries face a series of setbacks including lack of access to key markets, cancelled flights and delays in delivery.
 In response, Emirates Post is using the new hub at Dubai International Airport to facilitate the shipment, sorting and delivery of goods from around the world.
 The system allows the postal operator to provide the fastest, most consistent and cost-effective entry points to the middle East market that partners and third-party companies can also effectively tap into. Emirates Post uses new and easy-to-use API connectivity tools that seamlessly transfer data from anywhere in the world into local operations, customs and domestic systems, enabling them to process orders quickly and efficiently.
 Emirates Post already possesses one of the leading express domestic delivery operations in the UAE, which it has further expanded to keep up with demand.

We were on the cusp of that 2.5% threshold just before this recession hit. Note that inflation ex-energy tends to follow overall inflation with a slight lag. If gas prices remain depressed, we can expect this “core” inflation measure to decelerate substantially as well. This is par for the course during a recession.

Brazil great Rivaldo has backed Gabriel Jesus to make Premier League history at Manchester City after completing his switch from Palmeiras.


  City formally presented the 19-year-old on Thursday, having signed him from the Brazilian champions in August, and he could make his debut at the Etihad Stadium this weekend.


  The arrival of Jesus could provide City with the boost they need after slipping down to fifth in the table following their 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Everton last time out.


  Rivaldo believes the youngster will become an integral part of Pep Guardiola's plans, but has told City fans to give him time to settle into his new surroundings.


  "He is a future player," said Rivaldo, who was speaking at Betfair's #MagicOfBarca campaign.


  "He is a new player, 19 years old, and he has been playing in England football which is difficult football, not easy, you need to wait a bit to adapt to the cold.


  "But he's a player I think will make history in English football, because he's a great player.


  "I think the fans need to have a little patience, especially for their age, but from what I've seen him playing in Brazil, he's a great player."

Newcastle were the first Premier League team to furlough non-playing staff, with Liverpool, Norwich and Spurs following suit amid the coronavirus pandemic.


  Liverpool have since reversed their decision and Neville has claimed those that don’t, should have a transfer embargo placed on them.


  “What I would say in the bigger picture, these transfer discussions, Kane for £200m, Sancho for £100m, big money signings completely undermine the discussions they (Premier League clubs) are having with players,” he told Sky Sports.


  ‘If you are having a 30% pay cut across the board and you are talking about spending a billion on players, you may have to put a transfer embargo in place.

Stocks moved higher recently as the coronavirus pandemic showed signs of peaking in multiple regions. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted that his state could be approaching the apex. Specifically, that deaths related to the pandemic have been flat in New York, while the number of daily hospitalizations and patients in intensive-care units has declined.


   


  Wall Street also embraced a positive note from JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon, who wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that America can emerge from the coronavirus "stronger."


   


  Meanwhile, you stare with a dazed look at the damage done to your portfolio as elucidated in your recent brokerage statement. Take heart, investment opportunities remain plentiful. What you need is a willingness to take decisive action with an overwhelming sense of self-assurance. Moreover, you must be able to stay the course despite the consternation of others.


   


  Having a predefined investment plan and not deviating makes navigating the ups and downs that naturally occur much easier to stomach. Keep in mind that volatility is part and parcel of Wall Street's DNA.


   


  Yes, there will be a variety of unpleasant announcements as we move through the upcoming earnings season, but, again, that goes with the territory.


   


  Nonetheless, a portfolio comprised of high-quality stocks in diversified sectors with a solid history of rising dividends will see you through the current economic and financial calamity with an embrace for greater returns going forward.


   


  One of my favorite company's -- and one that it might behoove you to do some research on -- is Lockheed Martin (LMT), one of the world's largest security, defense and advanced technology companies.


   


  Lockheed has achieved considerable success in recent years and continues to dominate in the field of advanced technology. During 2019, the company saw increased sales and operating earnings within all its business segments.


   


  Like so many others, Lockheed is suffering from the negative impact of the coronavirus. At the same time, the company's long-term prospects are worth considering.


   


  For example, escalating US-China geopolitical tensions will bolster Lockheed's defense and security divisions. Furthermore, Lockheed's revenues are primarily attributable to government contracts, which is desirable right now since Uncle Sam always seems to have funds to spend in that arena.


   


  Lockheed reported net sales of $59.8 billion in 2019, with 61% of that coming from the Defense Department. And given the growing threats abroad, the company's defense business will increase going forward.


   


  A key reason is the company's ability to provide some of the most advanced military technology available in the areas of Advanced Aeronautics, MFC (missiles and fire control), RMS (rotary and mission systems) and space technologies.


   


  The company's prodigious cash generation has resulted in a balance sheet levered at just 1.1 times at the end of 2019. Translated that means the company's net debt (gross debt minus cash) divided by 2019 EBITDA was 1.1x. That number is low, especially for the defense industry.


   


  To its credit, Lockheed has not frolicked in the areas of acquiring companies or participating in buying back its own shares. Put it all together and Lockheed can sustain an impaired business environment during 2020 better than most.


   


  In a world where guidance is suspended and where many companies cannot forecast future cash inflow, along with being highly levered means Lockheed is in an enviable position.


   


  Yes, there is always the risk of a reduced dividend to lower cash outflow. However, Lockheed said in its last earnings call some 50% of its shareholders are there primarily for the dividend. Therefore, Lockheed is likely to continue raise their dividend payout.


   


  Meanwhile, the intrinsic value of the shares, noting that first quarter's numbers will not be available until April 21, is $1,172 versus a recent share price of $442.53, with a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.70%.

Former England manager Graham Taylor has died at the age of 72.
 Taylor's death was confirmed on Thursday, prompting an outpouring of grief in the game, especially in England.
 He managed his country between 1990 and 1993, taking over from Bobby Robson after semi-final glory at Italia 90, although he was not able to replicate such success as the Three Lions exited Euro 92 at the group stage and failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup under Taylor's leadership.
 A fly-on-the-wall documentary entitled 'An Impossible Job' wrote Taylor into English football folklore, his utterances of "Do I not like that!" and "Can we not knock it?" as England drew 1-1 in Poland going down in history.
 Regardless, Taylor will go down as one of the greatest managers in the history of England's Football League, with a phenomenal record of promotions to back him up.
 Taylor made his name in management with Watford, guiding the club from the Fourth Division to the First in the space if five years after taking charge in 1977 - taking the Hornets to the top flight for the first time in their history.
 Future England internationals John Barnes and Luther Blissett emerged under the tutelage of Taylor, who led Watford into Europe for the first time and to their only FA Cup final appearance to date in 1983-84, although Everton beat them to the trophy.
 Taylor was handed the position of honorary life president by the club and also has a stand at Vicarage Road named after him in light of his achievements.
 After a history-making decade with Watford, Taylor took charge of Aston Villa, who had fallen to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup. Watford were relegated that season after Taylor left and Barnes also went to Liverpool.
 Taylor restored Villa to the top flight immediately and after a season of consolidation, led them to second place in the First Division, just pipped to the title by Liverpool.
 Again England benefitted as David Platt emerged as a star at Villa, but Taylor was not able to lead his country to success when he assumed control.
 After a restorative term in charge of Wolves, Taylor affirmed his legendary status at Watford, once again guiding them to the top flight in successive seasons before leaving in 2001 and his managerial career ended after a season back at Villa in 2002-03.
 He went on to work extensively in the British media, also serving on the boards of Watford and Scunthorpe United - his hometown club - who went from escaping relegation to the Conference to the Championship with Taylor at the helm - a fitting addition to a legacy of success that ought to outshine his international struggles.

Liverpool defender Joe Gomez is in line to make his first appearance for 14 months when his side take on Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup.
 Manager Jurgen Klopp confirmed Sunday's third-round match at Anfield will likely see the 19-year-old play for the first time since October 2015, when he suffered a serious ACL injury.
 Gomez sustained the injury playing for the England Under-21 team in his first season at the club following a £3.5million move from Charlton Athletic.
 "It wouldn't be the biggest surprise if he is in the line-up," Klopp said at his pre-match media conference.
 "Playing for us is the logical next step for him. It is his first game at Anfield for a long time.
 "Joe is in a good way and really good in training.
 “He already had a long way to go and there will still be but everything is good.
 "We don't have the idea to give him a loan. He is a wonderful boy and we are really happy for him."
 Loris Karius is also set to return to Liverpool's team having lost his place in goal to Simon Mignolet last month following high-profile mistakes.
 "There is a big chance [Karius plays] - he has trained outstandingly," added Klopp.
 “We cannot ignore the pressure. I was sure Loris will benefit from stepping aside and Simon has done an outstanding job for us.
 "Loris has forced him to train on the highest level – we have two outstanding goalkeepers."
 Klopp will make changes for the match, but insists he is not taking League Two side Plymouth lightly.
 "Rotating makes sense and I am pretty sure we will see a few fresh legs on the pitch," he said.
 "Look at our squad. Pretty much all of them not involved in the last few games are pretty young.
 "But the players I pick are ready and we will pick a team which will have a good chance. Plymouth are a confident opponent. I saw Plymouth on the map - long way!"
 Klopp will not risk James Milner (calf) for the game, while Daniel Sturridge (ankle) has not trained this week.
 Philippe Coutinho and Joel Matip (both ankle) are nearing returns but this match will come too soon.

Former Italy star Marco Tardelli says Arsenal would suit Massimiliano Allegri should the Juventus boss seek a move to the Premier League.


  A Scudetto-winning coach with first AC Milan and then Juve, Allegri had been tipped to join Chelsea prior to Antonio Conte's appointment at Stamford Bridge.


  As Arsene Wenger seemingly approaches the twilight of his lengthy reign at the Gunners, Allegri has been touted as a potential successor to the Frenchman in north London.


  And speaking to Omnisport, former Juve, Inter and Italy midfielder Tardelli agreed with suggestions the 49-year-old is equipped to thrive at Emirates Stadium.


  "Should he win the title again this season he would have done a fantastic job and yes, as reported, then he might join Arsenal," he said.


  "Arsenal would suit him. They are an interesting club where he could work with serenity."


  Allegri guided Juve to the Champions League final during his first campaign in charge in 2014-15, the Turin giants losing 3-1 to Barcelona in Berlin.


  They are up against Porto in this season's round of 16, with Tardelli hoping Allegri, should he opt to leave, is able to add a third European Cup to the trophy cabinet at Juventus Stadium before he goes.


  "The icing on the cake before leaving would be for him to win the Champions League, but it is very unlikely," he said.

I have dedicated my life to helping and protecting people--particularly those in the Midwest. With an admiration and passion for flight, I have served in the Illinois Army National Guard, for the Department of Defense in Chicago, and as an emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter pilot. Through this experience, I have gained an understanding of the importance of aircraft for both civilians and military, and I have learned that these methods of transportation can be especially critical during emergency medical situations.


  Unfortunately, I have seen and experienced my fair share of accidents and tragic events during my tenure as an EMS helicopter pilot--gun shots, automobile crashes, ATV accidents, and other severe medical emergencies to name a few. In every instance where an air ambulance was deployed, on-the- ground emergency responders deemed them critically necessary. Typically, these patients were in such dire straits that they required immediate specialized care, often at an advanced hospital, and could not risk traveling far distances and the potential for traffic delays.


  It may seem that these emergency instances are rare and so are the use of air ambulances, but that is simply not the case. As more and more hospitals close in rural areas, these services are more common and important than ever before. In fact, it is estimated that more than 85 million Americans in rural places require helicopter services to reach a trauma center within an hour.


  Putting my profession aside, I am a resident of a rural locale. I want to ensure that my family and community have access to these increasingly important services during an emergency. Without them, we could be faced with a healthcare crisis.


  Air ambulances are quite simply the fastest, safest and most efficient way to get to a Trauma 1 or Trauma 2 Center--especially from a rural area, which could be miles or hours away. These specialty choppers are also equipped with essential medical supplies and have highly trained staff on board ready to aid a patient in need.


  While it's clear that there is a critical need for air ambulances, the companies that provide these services are in a vulnerable state. But Washington lawmakers have the opportunity to prevent these facilities from being put out of business. Lawmakers need to protect patients from surprise billing and hold insurance companies accountable. I am hopeful that Illinois lawmakers will support legislation that preserves air medical services and all their lifesaving capabilities.


  Samuel Cain lives in Dahinda. He currently serves as an emergency medical services helicopter pilot.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp urged his team to start enjoying themselves again after a run of indifferent form.
 The German's men have fallen to fourth in the Premier League on the back of a three-game winless run, including a 3-2 defeat at home to Swansea City on Saturday.
 Klopp feels Liverpool's love of their possession-based, high-tempo style that saw them make such a strong start to the season has eased.
 "We are Liverpool, a really good football-playing side, and we don't enjoy the job we have to do," he told UK newspapers.
 "It is not as though we are a team at the bottom of the league that has to defend 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the time.
 "In most of our games we are dominant, so we have to enjoy this, even when we don't come through after five minutes."
 Liverpool's defence has faced the most criticism during the campaign, with their 27 league goals conceded the most of the top four.
 Klopp said his team as a whole needed to take responsibility for their defending, which cost them against Swansea.
 "We have a lot of meetings. It was because the goals we have conceded in 2017 have been a little bit of the same story," he said.
 "The influence of throw-ins is a little bit too big on the goals we concede. It's not that teams create a lot of chances against us. That's still a good sign. Usually, they don't create a lot and still score.
 "There has been a lot of talk about defence, you always speak about players - I speak about the whole defensive work of the team."
 Liverpool host Southampton in their EFL Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday, trailing the tie 1-0.

Louis van Gaal denies he has retired from management, with the former Manchester United boss open to a return to Spain.


  Van Gaal appeared set to retire at the age of 65, citing family issues in quotes reported by De Telegraaf on Monday, after he was sacked by United last season.


  The ex-Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Ajax, Netherlands and United boss, however, has clarified his future, insisting he is only taking a break from management.


  "No, no no. I have not retired," Van Gaal told Cadena SER. "I am just taking a sabbatical year and after that I will decide. There is a good chance that I will retire.


  "In the Netherlands the press writes what they want. I received a headline yesterday, but I said that I might retire, but this is not the time to say it, and for this reason I have taken a sabbatical year and then I will decide."


  A return to LaLiga could be on the cards for Van Gaal after he turned down embattled outfit Valencia, who are searching for a new head coach following the resignation of Cesare Prandelli.


  "I received an offer from Valencia a month or so ago but I said no," said Van Gaal, who guided Barca to consecutive LaLiga tiles from 1997-99.


  "Next year may be different. It will depend on how I feel."

I've made it a point to stick to my structured routine as much as possible. I work from home, set deadlines, and try to get as much done within that time. I'm also spending loads of time with my family. We play games, watch positive movies that lighten the mood, and indulge in banter and conversations. I video-call my friends and colleagues on a regular basis to catch up. In a way, we're all looking out for each other. I'm also sticking to my fitness routine and working out just the way I was before the lockdown. I'm pursuing my spiritual studies as I did earlier. And I also find myself cleaning up the clutter that tends to accumulate in the house over the years. In fact, this lockdown has given us an opportunity to do all those things that we didn't have time for earlier. For me, this is also a time to reflect and recalibrate my thought process and roadmap ahead.

Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has directed steel PSUs to adopt the 'Annadaan initiative' for feeding migrant workers and weaker sections of the society in and around their areas of operation.
 A ministry official said Pradhan is holding meetings with senior ministry officials and chiefs of the PSUs on a daily basis through video conference to take stock of the situation.
 "Steel CPSEs have been advised (by the minister) to adopt 'Annadaan' initiative in and around their areas of operation for feeding migrant workers and weaker sections of the society. They (PSUs) have also taken initiatives for it," the official said.
 Pradhan has also asked the PSUs to publicise benefits of using Aarogya Setu App through social networking modes such as WhatsApp messages, e-mails, SMS, Twitter and other social media handles, in their plant, mines, offices and townships.
 Further, steel PSUs have been directed to adhere to the norms for social distancing in their workplace, townships, mines, etc and report about compliance to the ministry on a daily basis.
 Steel CPSEs have been advised to keep their hospitals, quarantine facilities, etc. for patients and suspected cases of COVID-19, in full preparedness, the official said, adding that "a daily compliance report on government instructions and overall preparedness of such facilities is being obtained."
 There are seven PSUs under the Ministry of Steel.  While Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) produce steel, NMDC and MOIL are miners and KIOCL is a pellet maker. Besides, MSTC is an e-commerce firm under the Ministry and Mecon is a consultancy firm.

Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte conceded his richly successful switch to three at the back has left Branislav Ivanovic as the odd man out, with speculation swirling over the Serbia captain's future at Stamford Bridge.


  Ivanovic has been linked with a move to Russian Premier League club Zenit, while a clutch of English top-flight clubs are also reportedly interested in the 32-year-old's signature.


  Conte's rejig to a 3-4-2-1 following September's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal inspired Chelsea's on-going and relentless march towards the Premier League title.


  Ivanovic wore the captain's armband at Emirates Stadium and continued what was, at that stage, an ever-present record in the league.


  He has not made Conte's Premier League starting XI since, though, and the former Juventus boss accepted a move could be on the cards before the window shuts on Tuesday.


  "I don't know because there are four days [before the deadline] and, in this month, there are a lot of speculations," he told a news conference when asked about the future of a player who joined Chelsea from Lokomotiv Moscow in 2008.


  "I don't know if anything happens about him. Sometimes I think that you [the media] know more than me.


  "I think in this season Ivanovic has played with me. He had different games in the starting XI.


  "When I switched to three at the back, something changed and, for sure, I have to make decisions - to pick only 11 players.


  "I think that, until now, he's always involved in our squad."


  A settled and dominant starting XI has also restricted opportunities for the likes of club captain John Terry and Cesc Fabregas, while Oscar made a lucrative move to Shanghai SIPG and Conte felt it would be unwise to make assumptions over Ivanovic's desires under the circumstances.


  "For sure, about this situation it's better to talk with the player, no?" he said.


  "To know if there are different ideas, different visions for the future to the present.


  "To reply for another person is not the right thing to do."


  Conte was emphatic by contrast in stating midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek would not be permitted to leave Stamford Bridge on loan next week.


  Alongside Ivanovic and Bournemouth target Asmir Begovic, the England Under-21 international is set to feature in Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Brentford and Conte believes his development will be best continued at Chelsea, despite playing only 15 minutes in the Premier League this season.


  "Ruben stays here. He's a young player with great potential, and he has another great chance to play from the start and to show what I'm seeing very well [in training]," Conte said, before urging patience from the youngsters on the fringes of his squad.


  "I think when there are young players you must understand why the team is where they are," Conte added.


  "Chelsea are a top team and to play in Chelsea is not easy. It's not easy.


  "I remember, also, when I was manager of Juventus it was the same. We had young players, very good players, but to get into the first-team often you need to have a step and then to come back.


  "It's very difficult to go from the academy and then play in the first-team. We are talking about a top team at the top level. It's not easy."


  Following a 4-1 win over League One Peterborough United in round three, Conte is relishing another memorable atmosphere against near-neighbours Brentford - something he feels is particular to English cup competitions.


  "If you remember in the last game, we played with a great atmosphere," he added. "It's fantastic because this type of situation only happens here in England.


  "When two teams play from different leaguers in other countries... like Serie A and Serie B teams, you'd find 1,000 people in the stadium and think that you are lucky."

Avram Grant believes Antonio Conte arrived at Chelsea at the perfect time, while insisting Jose Mourinho is no genius.
 Conte took over at Stamford Bridge ahead of this season and has helped the club to an eight-point lead atop the Premier League table.
 The Italian is at the helm after a poor 2015-16 campaign for Chelsea, who parted ways with Mourinho during that season.
 Grant, in charge at the club in 2007-08, said the timing was ideal for former Juventus coach Conte.
 "Conte came at the right time. The players were ready for the change and wanted the change," the Ghana boss said via The Guardian.
 "With a lot of respect to Jose, I didn't like that the media said he was the king of the world and a genius — he was not — and he's not so useless like they are saying about him now.
 "He's a good coach, with problems like any other person."
 Conte arrived at Chelsea having led Juve to three consecutive Serie A titles from 2011-14.
 Grant felt the 47-year-old made an early mistake in England, but corrected quickly enough after a poor start.
 "I think he started to please the supporters. He played 4-4-2 and he'd never played like this in his life — I've followed his whole career," he said.
 "He played three at the back with Juventus and had very good results in Italy. He came to Chelsea and changed. Don't change your personality.
 "There are coaches who can play different systems, like Alex Ferguson. Conte, [Arsene] Wenger, their style of play will not change and it's not good for them to change because maybe they don't know another system.
 "I think the best thing to happen to Chelsea was that they lost 3-0 to Arsenal — then he came back to his roots and they play a system that is also good for their players."

Someone once asked me at work if I was the daughter of James Litten and I said, No, I was the daughter of Tom Hamilton and they looked shocked until I followed it up with, “Not that Tom Hamilton.” When I did meet “that” Tom Hamilton I repeated the story to him he said he would like to someday meet the other Tom Hamilton and shake his hand but sadly that never happened with Owen County’s Tom Hamilton dying in 2009 and the other Tom Hamilton in 2018 but the last time I was in Owensboro I found an autographed copy of Tom Hamilton’s 1969 book, A 500 Mile Walk, at a local Flea Market.


  Anniversary announcements have always been the most uncommon entries and deaths the most common. Ever once in a while there will be a week where no deaths are reported but that is extremely rare.


  Reading obituaries can be depressing. Sometimes there will be a person who lived one hundred years on this earth die the same week as a person who just received hours. I didn’t grow up in Owen County. I moved here in August of 1996 and was hired by the local Library in October of that year so most people I know I met through my job.


  It is always a shock to run across the obituary of someone I knew. Sometimes they are people who I still expect to look up and see like George Taylor.


  George passed in 2009 but I still see him standing by the Circulation Desk wearing denim overalls that always looked freshly pressed holding a stack of carefully chosen books. I didn’t know George Taylor on a personal level but I always noticed his positive energy and I miss his presence.

Nearly 134,000 Indiana residents filed unemployment insurance claims with the state of Indiana last week, according to data released from the Indiana Department of Workforce Development on Thursday. While it is a decrease from the record-breaking number of claims the week before, it is still one of the highest number of claims made in a single week.
 Of those, Hoosier Times counties continued to see high numbers. Those filing for unemployment in south-central Indiana primarily came from the construction, manufacturing, retail trade, accommodation and food services, and health care and social services industries, according to the data released Thursday. These patterns are consistent with filings made in March, due to executive orders restricting certain business operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Though the counties hit the hardest the week before saw a lower number of new claims made during the week ending April 4 — Monroe County with 1,457, Lawrence County with 613 and Morgan County with 947 — rural area counties have seen increases in the number of claims being made.

  Stocks moved higher recently as the coronavirus pandemic showed signs of peaking in multiple regions. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted that his state could be approaching the apex. Specifically, that deaths related to the pandemic have been flat in New York, while the number of daily hospitalizations and patients in intensive-care units has declined.


  Wall Street also embraced a positive note from JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon, who wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that America can emerge from the coronavirus \"stronger.\"


  Meanwhile, you stare with a dazed look at the damage done to your portfolio as elucidated in your recent brokerage statement. Take heart, investment opportunities remain plentiful. What you need is a willingness to take decisive action with an overwhelming sense of self-assurance. Moreover, you must be able to stay the course despite the consternation of others.


  Having a predefined investment plan and not deviating makes navigating the ups and downs that naturally occur much easier to stomach. Keep in mind that volatility is part and parcel of Wall Street's DNA.


  Yes, there will be a variety of unpleasant announcements as we move through the upcoming earnings season, but, again, that goes with the territory.


  Nonetheless, a portfolio comprised of high-quality stocks in diversified sectors with a solid history of rising dividends will see you through the current economic and financial calamity with an embrace for greater returns going forward.


  One of my favorite company's -- and one that it might behoove you to do some research on -- is Lockheed Martin (LMT), one of the world's largest security, defense and advanced technology companies.


  Lockheed has achieved considerable success in recent years and continues to dominate in the field of advanced technology. During 2019, the company saw increased sales and operating earnings within all its business segments.


  Like so many others, Lockheed is suffering from the negative impact of the coronavirus. At the same time, the company's long-term prospects are worth considering.


  For example, escalating US-China geopolitical tensions will bolster Lockheed's defense and security divisions. Furthermore, Lockheed's revenues are primarily attributable to government contracts, which is desirable right now since Uncle Sam always seems to have funds to spend in that arena.


  Lockheed reported net sales of $59.8 billion in 2019, with 61% of that coming from the Defense Department. And given the growing threats abroad, the company's defense business will increase going forward.


  A key reason is the company's ability to provide some of the most advanced military technology available in the areas of Advanced Aeronautics, MFC (missiles and fire control), RMS (rotary and mission systems) and space technologies.


  The company's prodigious cash generation has resulted in a balance sheet levered at just 1.1 times at the end of 2019. Translated that means the company's net debt (gross debt minus cash) divided by 2019 EBITDA was 1.1x. That number is low, especially for the defense industry.


  To its credit, Lockheed has not frolicked in the areas of acquiring companies or participating in buying back its own shares. Put it all together and Lockheed can sustain an impaired business environment during 2020 better than most.


  In a world where guidance is suspended and where many companies cannot forecast future cash inflow, along with being highly levered means Lockheed is in an enviable position.


  Yes, there is always the risk of a reduced dividend to lower cash outflow. However, Lockheed said in its last earnings call some 50% of its shareholders are there primarily for the dividend. Therefore, Lockheed is likely to continue raise their dividend payout.


  Meanwhile, the intrinsic value of the shares, noting that first quarter's numbers will not be available until April 21, is $1,172 versus a recent share price of $442.53, with a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.70%.
