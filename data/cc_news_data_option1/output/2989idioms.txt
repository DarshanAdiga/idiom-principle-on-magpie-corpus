BEIJING -- China is stepping-up testing for the coronavirus in an attempt to get a handle on new outbreaks that have defied the country's considerable success in containing the virus that was first detected in Wuhan late last year.

As the Senior Pastor of Liberty Church of Peoria and the President of the Peoria Chapter of the NAACP, I view public policy through the lens of my faith and its teachings. One of the central tenets of all religions - whether it be Christian, Jewish, or Muslim -- is that the resources of our society should be directed to those who are most in need.
   
 It's the responsibility of our government and its leaders to implement policies that reflect these values to help all of our families and allocate resources to those who need it most. Unfortunately, too often this does not occur, and it's incumbent upon those of us who see this injustice to take action to change it.
   
 That is the case today with Illinois' current tax system, and why I'm fighting to pass the Fair Tax this fall. Our current tax system is broken and fundamentally unfair, failing to uphold the values I live by as a faith leader by placing an undue burden on the lower and middle-income families in our state, including essential workers like our nurses and our grocery store clerks who have kept us safe during this pandemic.
   
 It's not fair that our working families, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet during these difficult times, are forced to pay the same rate as the millionaires and billionaires who have even see their bottom lines increase in recent months. As a result, these middle and lower-income Illinoisans pay nearly double the percentage of their income in taxes compared to the wealthiest 1% in our state.
   
 That just isn't right. To create an Illinois where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, we must lift the burden off of our working families and finally ask the wealthy to pay their share.
   
 And as the President of the Peoria Chapter of the NAACP, I see the inequities people of color in our community face every day, and how our current tax system adds yet another barrier to equality. In our state, people of color are more likely to be working in low-income jobs, and are more likely to be working on the frontlines of the coronavirus crisis. Yet, they're forced to pay the same tax rate as the wealthiest Illinoisans, adding additional pain at a time when they need help the most.
   
 The Fair Tax will help set things right, not only creating a tax system that is fair and representative of the values we hold dear, but will also generate billions of dollars in new revenue each year that can go towards funding the critical social services our families rely on.
   
 We can make that happen by only increasing raising taxes on those making over $250,000 a year, while ensuring taxes go down or stay the same for at least 97% of Illinoisans. As my faith tells me that we should always prioritize policies that help those less fortunate, it's clear the Fair Tax is the next step toward making Illinois the best place it can be.
   
 In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., "The time is always right to do what is right." Now more than ever, it's time to pass the Fair Tax.

Ruth (Irons) Clark BERLIN -- Ruth Irons Clark, 81, formerly of Gilbert Road in Williamstown, passed away on Saturday, July 25, 2020, at the Woodridge Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. Born June 18, 1939, in Bennington, she was the daughter of Francis and Lillian (Coutts) Irons. Ruth graduated from Williamstown High School in 1957. On Aug. 18, 1958, she married Richard A. Clark Sr. in Norfolk, Virginia, where they made their home for a short time before moving back to Vermont and settling in Williamstown where they raised six children. They later divorced. Ruth had a very full, active life. From early on, she was always working on some endeavor. She worked for Beeline Fashions, Artex Paints, made amazing sweaters with her knitting machine, worked as a census taker going door to door, and hosted weeklong summer camps, Sleepy Hollow Christian Camp, which were packed with activities and made lasting impressions on many, many young individuals. Later, Ruth became a real estate agent. She got her license in 1981 and went on to own and operate The Property Mart from 1983 to 1993. While at the real estate office, she started Grandma's Book Attic. She was an avid book reader and she surrounded herself with thousands of books. After selling the Property Mart, she moved the bookstore to her home, filling every nook and cranny of the house. She also started Ruth Clark Real Estate which she operated for a few years from her home to be able to continue with her passion for real estate, but on a smaller level. She was a longtime member of the Websterville Baptist Church and served on several boards and committees. During this time, she also organized and did fundraising for several missionary trips, taking along her grandsons for some incredible experiences. Ruth was known as a kind, compassionate, caring person who was always the first to volunteer and to help someone out. Her endless energy and drive was appreciated by everyone who knew her. Survivors include her children, Tammy Clark of Williamstown, Lorinda Stone of Websterville, Katrina Clark of Barre, Paula F. Clark of Williamstown, and Richard Clark Jr. and wife Paula J. Clark of Williamstown; her grandchildren, Keith Clark, Reuben Stone, Kyle Marquez, Logan Clark, Bridget Stone, Ryan Marquez and Alona Clark; one great-grandchild, Claressa Sweet; her siblings, Jean Brown of Williston, Carol Irons of Albany, Paul Irons of Berlin, and Morgan Irons of Calais; as well as several nephews and nieces. In addition to her parents, she was predeceased by her daughter, Andrea Clark; her brother, John Irons; and her ex-husband, Richard Clark Sr. The graveside service to honor and celebrate her life will be held on Friday, July 31, 2020, at 1 p.m. in the East Hill Cemetery in Williamstown. There are no calling hours. A gathering will follow the service at Ruth's homestead on Gilbert Road. Arrangements are by the Hooker Whitcomb Funeral Home, 7 Academy St., Barre.

To mask or not to mask? Across Florida, the answers are a patchy, mixed-up mess. That's why the state needs a strong, consistent and enforceable baseline rule that requires people to wear face coverings outside their homes. Gov. Ron DeSantis could do a lot to repair his tattered reputation for coronavirus response by issuing such an order.
   
 Among local cities and counties, confusion reigns. Many cities, including DeLand, St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, have authorized fines for people caught without a mask or shield. Other cities, such as Flagler Beach and New Smyrna Beach, require them, but don't impose penalties. Myriad other city and county jurisdictions -- including Ormond Beach, Palm Coast and unincorporated portions of St. Johns, Volusia and Flagler counties-- "strongly encourage" facial coverings but don't mandate them. And each jurisdiction has its own list of exceptions attached to its mask ordinance -- some specify masks everywhere except inside private homes, others offer far greater latitude.
   
 Even among the get-tough jurisdictions, there's wide variance: Down in Key West or up in St. Augustine, failure to wear a mask could set you back a $500 fine -- 20 times what DeLand proposes for a first offense.
   
 Meanwhile, various retailers, restaurants and other businesses are operating under their own patchwork of rules. Some have decided to require masks (though the "requirement" often goes away when store employees confront a recalcitrant customer), others simply request that their customers wear them. But retailers are starting to increase pressure on DeSantis and other governors, saying that in some jurisdictions, businesses can face fines for not forcing their customers to wear masks. Without a statewide mandate, business leaders feel helpless.
   
 It's like this across the state. Enough is enough. Florida should follow the lead of at least 30 other states including Texas, Alabama, New York and Louisiana, and enact a strong, statewide mask rule. That rule would, at a minimum, require masks of people outside their homes in any place where they can't guarantee "social distancing" of at least six feet -- including inside businesses. Exemptions should be rare and obvious, such as permission to remove masks while in the act of eating or drinking. The state should also take a stand against the fake "exemption permits" that many are brandishing as get-out-of-mask-free cards; there's no reliable evidence that wearing a mask poses a real threat to anyone's health.
   
 A rule that's tough enough could justify a pre-emption on more stringent local requirements, though the state should always be careful when treading on home rule. But even if Florida leaders set a strong and reasonable minimum, and allowed municipalities and counties to raise the ante, the result would be better protection for Floridians.
   
 Why does the state need this rule? Because infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rocketing out of control in Florida, and because masks, combined with social distancing, work. Even makeshift, non-medical face coverings have been shown to reduce an individual's ability to spew potentially virus-laden "droplets" into the air. If Florida is serious about reducing its infection rate and saving lives, it will require masks. DeSantis should act accordingly.

No more chances for Fawn Mott, 35, of Dowagiac, who was sentenced to prison for the 2014 arson of the Three Rivers Walmart Monday.
   
 St. Joseph County Circuit Court Judge Paul Stutesman gave her 30 months to 10 years in prison with 603 days credit for time already served.
   
 The judge also sentenced her to 18 months to five years for a 2017 first degree retail fraud theft, 18 months to two years for resisting arrest and 18 months to 10 years for possession of meth.
   
 Mott, with a history of mental health issues, had been sentenced under the Swift and Sure Sanctions probation program of the Michigan Department of Corrections. It is an intensive probation supervision program that targets high-risk felony offenders with a history of probation violations or failures.
   
 Mott had pleaded no contest to the charges after she was found competent. While on probation in July 2017 he tried to steal items from the store, fled from police, and had meth on her when arrested.
   
 After serving a year in county jail and being placed on the special probation, Judge Stutesman said "she fell apart and absconded."  He was not sure if Tribal Police or the Cass County prosecutor will file new charges in that county after a July arrest.
   
 In June 2014, a woman was captured on Walmart security video loitering for some time in the store. She then used a notepad of paper to start the fire in the clearance section of the hardware department.
   
 Because of fire suppression sprinklers, the building sustained no structural damage from the blaze, some large areas did see smoke and water damage.
   
 The Walmart store discarded all the  produce and meat as well as anything that may have been damaged by smoke or water.
   
 Walmart declined to report damage, but Three Rivers Fire Department said the loss was "tens of thousands of dollars."
   
 Mott was identified by her truck seen leaving the scene of the fire which closed the store for almost three days.  Police arrested her months later.

To U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg: I am beyond disgusted at your silence and/or complicity in your support of Donald Trump. I know you purport yourself to be a decent man, but history will not find you so if you persist in going along with this irrevocably flawed, self- promoting, anti-American demagogue.
   
 Trump continues to show us all just who he is; we call on you to act. Our nation teeters on a precipice of self-destruction because of Trump's willingness to sow seeds of division for his political power and financial benefit. You have sold out your 7th District neighbors, fellow Michiganders and this republic for the perpetuation of your own power and privilege in your continued support of Trump.
   
 Can your job as a congressman be so important to you that you will sell your soul, your integrity and the American ideal for 30 pieces of silver?
   
 You embarrass us with your lack of moral courage and real American leadership. I know you are not suffering from a terminal illness, nor are you planning to leave office, either of which might make it easier for you to let go of your seduction by power, but stand, man, STAND!
   
 If an assertion of the truth and goodness of American democracy in any way causes you to lose an election, it will be a righteous sacrifice and history will honor you.
   
 I urge all voters to cast their ballots in November for the candidate who has the gumption, good sense and love of country so that we can be relieved of the chaos and threat we now experience. That is not you so far, Tim.

As the coronavirus pandemic tears through Latin America and the Caribbean, killing more than 180,000 and destroying the livelihoods of tens of millions in the region, it is also undermining democratic norms that were already under strain.
 Leaders ranging from the centre-right to the far-left have used the crisis as justification to extend their time in office, weaken oversight of government actions and silence critics — actions that under different circumstances would be described as authoritarian and anti-democratic but are now being billed as lifesaving measures to curb the spread of the disease.
 The gradual undermining of democratic rules during an economic crisis and a public health catastrophe could leave Latin America primed for slower growth and an increase in corruption and human rights abuses, experts warned. This is particularly true in places where political rights and accountability were already in steep decline.
 “It’s not a matter of left or right; it’s a general decline of democracy across the region,” said Alessandra Pinna, a Latin America researcher at Freedom House, an independent Washington-based research organisation that measures global political liberties.
 There are now five Latin American and Caribbean nations with recent democratic histories — Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guyana, Bolivia and Haiti — where governments weren’t chosen in free and fair elections or have overstayed their time in office. That is the highest number since the late 1980s, when the Cold War receded and several countries in the grip of civil war or military dictatorships transitioned to peace and democracy.
 Most of those leaders were already bending the rules of democracy to stay in power before the pandemic but seized on emergency conditions created by the spread of the virus to strengthen their position.
 President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has detained or conducted home raids against dozens of journalists, social activists and opposition leaders for questioning the government’s dubious coronavirus figures.
 In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega released thousands of inmates because of the threat posed by the virus but kept political prisoners behind bars, while in Guyana, a lockdown thwarted protests against the government’s attempt to stay in power despite having lost an election.
 In Bolivia, a caretaker government has used the pandemic to postpone elections, tap into emergency aid to bolster its electoral campaign and threaten to ban the main opposition candidate from running.
 And in the island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, the government imposed a strict lockdown on its 50,000 people during the campaign for general elections in June, hampering opposition efforts to meet voters while also keeping international election observers from traveling to the country.
 It was the first time in recent history that a host country withdrew its invitation to the Organization of American States, a regional group that promotes democracy, to observe elections.
 The loss of public trust in governments in Latin America is not new, but the erosion of democratic norms in the pandemic arrived at a time when the region’s economic growth and social progress were already unraveling, leaving many uncertain about the ability of democratic leaders to solve entrenched problems such as inequality, crime and corruption.
 By 2018, only 1 in 4 people in Latin America said they were satisfied with democracy — the lowest number since Latinobarómetro, a regional polling company, began asking that question 25 years ago.
 Discontent with the political establishment led to a wave of populist victories in recent years, including those of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who is on the far-right, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, who is on the left. It also led to mass street protests in several Latin American countries last year.
 The pandemic, hitting during this time of political upheaval, has plunged the region into the deepest recession in its history, exacerbating weaknesses in health and welfare systems and highlighting the ways in which many leaders are unable to meet public demands.
 “All the things that Latin Americans have already been clamouring for — greater equality, better services — have been dramatically worsened by the pandemic,” said Cynthia Arnson, Latin America program director at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. “The economic pain is dramatic, and it’s putting additional strain on the already weak institutions.”
 It has also put a strain on the region’s struggling health care systems. Latin America has become a global hot spot for the virus, with Brazil, Mexico and Peru among the 10 nations with the highest numbers of deaths. And according to the United Nations, about 16 million people in Latin America are expected to fall into extreme poverty this year, reversing nearly all of the gains made by the region this century.
 Adding to those challenges, democracy in Latin America has also lost a champion in the United States, which had played an important role in promoting democracy after the end of the Cold War by financing good governance programs and calling out authoritarian abuses.
 Under President Donald Trump, the United States has mostly focused regional policy on opposing left-wing autocrats in Venezuela and Cuba and curbing immigration, making aid to Central American nations, among the region’s poorest, contingent on cooperating with the administration on immigration.
 In the few democratic strongholds in Latin America, such as Uruguay and Costa Rica, leaders responded to the pandemic with efficiency and transparency, bolstering public trust in the government. In the Dominican Republic and Suriname, incumbent presidents recently bowed out of power after losing elections that were held despite the pandemic.
 In many instances, judges and civil servants have resisted the attacks on democratic institutions during the pandemic, said Javier Corrales, a professor of Latin American studies at Amherst College in Massachusetts. “The defenders of liberal democracy in Latin America are not defeated,” Corrales said. “It’s not an open terrain for would-be authoritarians.”
 Yet in most Latin American nations, the coronavirus accelerated an existing democratic decline by exposing the weakness and corruption of governments in the face of the catastrophe.
 “When confronted with an existential threat, countries that did not already have deep democratic systems are choosing tactics that help leaders consolidate their power,” said John Polga-Hecimovich, a political scientist at the US Naval Academy in Maryland.

I don’t think it’s just tapping into the existing Brimfield market, it’s pulling a lot of people who maybe have an interest in going but haven’t gone.

The toll takes the country's total fatalities from the novel coronavirus to 189, more than half of which have occurred in the second-most popular state of Victoria and its capital Melbourne, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.
 Australia had prided itself on rapidly containing the initial COVID-19 outbreak but a second wave which began in Victoria last month has forced Melbourne back into lockdown and sparked outbreaks in other areas including Sydney.
 "We've now been in this lockdown (in Melbourne) for some weeks and we are not getting the results we would hope for, and as a result the further measures that are taken are certainly necessary," Morrison told reporters, backing the restrictions announced by the Victorian government.
 "On some days the virus wins, on other days we beat it. But I think we've got to be careful not to slip into some idea that there's some golden immunity that Australia has in relation to this virus."
 Further restrictions on movement would deal a blow to the economy which is already in its first recession for 30 years, but failure to control the latest outbreaks would do more economic harm in the long run, Morrison added.
 Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said everyone in the state of more than 6 million people would be required to wear a mask when outside from Sunday, widening a requirement already in place in Melbourne.
 He also extended social distancing restrictions, with residents in communities southwest of Melbourne no longer allowed to have visitors to their homes from late Thursday.
 Cafes, pubs and restaurants would be allowed to stay open, however, because these were controlled environments where social distancing rules could be enforced.
 "Having friends over to your house is not a controlled environment," Andrews said.
 The previous record daily count of new infections in Australia was 518 reported on Monday. The country has confirmed a total of 16,298 cases since the pandemic began.
 Andrews said that while the latest spike in cases was concerning, the majority of them were at known hotspots such as aged-care homes and the number of untraceable infections was "much smaller".
 Australia's most-populous state, New South Wales (NSW), reported 18 new cases, with six from unknown sources.
 Northeastern Queensland state, which had effectively eliminated the virus, said it had found three new cases, two of whom were believed to have contracted COVID-19 while in the NSW capital Sydney. Queensland closed its borders to people from Sydney on Wednesday.
 Queensland police allege that two 19-year-old women who brought the virus into the state after returning from a trip to Victoria had falsified travel documents and lied to authorities about their movements.
 Both now faced criminal charges but one was continuing to refuse to tell officials where she had been, amid a spike in cases south of Brisbane where the pair reside.
 “They went to extraordinary lengths to be deceitful and deceptive and quite frankly criminal in their behaviour and that is what has put the community at risk,” Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll told reporters.
 Queensland earlier this month denied entry to anyone who had been to Victoria in the previous 14 days.

I also reconnected with someone I sell to on eBay and with two people who I sell to at shows.” Waters said she went for a diverse offering and buyers responded by buying across the board. “I was on my phone so much, getting so many hits, that I had to charge my phone in the middle of the day. I haven’t had to do that since I got a new phone in the fall.” Many of her photographs — from photo booth series to daguerreotypes to men’s fashion silver gelatin prints — were priced $10 to $125.

 To U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg: I am beyond disgusted at your silence and/or complicity in your support of Donald Trump. I know you purport yourself to be a decent man, but history will not find you so if you persist in going along with this irrevocably flawed, self- promoting, anti-American demagogue.
 Trump continues to show us all just who he is; we call on you to act. Our nation teeters on a precipice of self-destruction because of Trump's willingness to sow seeds of division for his political power and financial benefit. You have sold out your 7th District neighbors, fellow Michiganders and this republic for the perpetuation of your own power and privilege in your continued support of Trump.
 Can your job as a congressman be so important to you that you will sell your soul, your integrity and the American ideal for 30 pieces of silver?
 You embarrass us with your lack of moral courage and real American leadership. I know you are not suffering from a terminal illness, nor are you planning to leave office, either of which might make it easier for you to let go of your seduction by power, but stand, man, STAND!
 If an assertion of the truth and goodness of American democracy in any way causes you to lose an election, it will be a righteous sacrifice and history will honor you.
 I urge all voters to cast their ballots in November for the candidate who has the gumption, good sense and love of country so that we can be relieved of the chaos and threat we now experience. That is not you so far, Tim.

You can connect the R1700BTs to your projector via a Y-Cable, which goes from the Mars Pro II’s headphone jack into one of its RCA (red and white) inputs. The speakers have an additional RCA input and Bluetooth support, so you can plug an additional home theater component, or stream music to them wirelessly. Edifier includes a remote with the R1700BTs, so you can adjust their volume and switch inputs on the fly if the video you’re watching gets too loud or soft.

Leo Ferguson, a Black Jewish progressive activist, sees a parallel between the way Farrakhan demonizes Jews and the way some white Jews will point to Farrakhan to emphasize antisemitism in the Black community. In both cases, he believes they are distractions from the real issue.
