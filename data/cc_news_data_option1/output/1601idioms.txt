“We have ordered our naval units at sea that if any warships or military units from the naval force of America’s terrorist army wants to jeopardize our commercial vessels or our combat vessels, they must target those (American) warships or naval units,” Salami said.
 The latest dispute comes after the U.S. Navy said last week that 11 Guard naval gunboats had carried out “dangerous and harassing approaches” to American Navy and Coast Guard vessels in the Persian Gulf. The Americans said they used a variety of nonlethal means to warn off the Iranian boats, which eventually left. Iran, meanwhile, accused the U.S. of sparking the incident, without offering evidence for the claim.
 Iran has had tense encounters at sea for years with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all oil passes. The U.S. has patrolled the area to protect global shipping for decades, something Iran describes as akin to it patrolling the Gulf of Mexico.
 Trump on Wednesday, facing a collapsing global energy market and the coronavirus pandemic amid his re-election campaign, tweeted out a warning to Iran, saying that he ordered the Navy to "shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.”
 “We don’t want their gunboats surrounding our boats, and traveling around our boats and having a good time,” Trump told reporters Wednesday evening at the White House. “We’re not going to stand for it. ... They’ll shoot them out of the water.”
 The International Crisis Group, noting the tensions, urged both countries to create a deconfliction hotline to avoid a possible military confrontation.

“I think that could make or break us on the court, how those young kids play for us this year,” she said. “I’m super excited for the season. Someone had talked to me about, ‘what if they don’t have the season,’ and I can’t even think that far or about that even happening. Our potential, and how we ended last year, we can jump back in and this group can really do some good things.”

Walking around the property she rents, empty of people, Fripp ticks off the expenses. "Hay is $50 a large bale and we go through at least 20 a month. Grain costs around $500 a month. The blacksmith still comes monthly and of course the overhead of maintenance, rent and utilities still takes its major monthly bite of $6,000. Even though I have paid rent without fail for 42 years, the owners are not yet willing to negotiate the rent. Vet costs can run from $1,000 a month to $100, depending on what could happen when dealing with the animals."
