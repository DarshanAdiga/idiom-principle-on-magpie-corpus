This unanticipated situation creates a rare moment for the Legislature to use its own right to put propositions on an uncluttered ballot, without gathering any citizens’ signatures. Since the Legislature is supposed to pass laws on their own, they place propositions on the ballot only when they are required to do so.

We seem to have forgotten, the job of a school system is to educate, not to entertain students, their parents, grandparents, graduates, or the citizenry in general. The entertainment activities, called co-curricular by WTS, are wonderful in many ways, but they need not be supported by tax dollars.
 Football and basketball are the first activities I would have funded locally by booster clubs, alumni, local businesses, and other interested parties.
 Putting another $285 million into the physical plant of WTS, or any comparable amount into your school district, is not a step forward. It only reinforces the weakened education system of today.
 How do we go about changing education? Just as we recognize the importance of pre-, peri-, and postnatal care, we need to extend our involvement with parents and children in their homes and at school.
 What would WTS be able to achieve if it had an added $285 million over the course of eight years ($35.6 million per year)? Those funds could support mentoring and tutoring families wanting to see their children achieve higher levels of development.
 Education needs to give students the tools to excel in their world, not in the one we know from yesterday. WTS might win fewer championships, but let’s not return to normal. Let’s blaze a trail to an era of excellence.

Un pacchetto sviluppato da Mopar e destinato a tutte le vetture di Fca accompagna la Fase 2 della mobilita italiana, ovvero quella in cui l'automobile ricoprira un ruolo importante perche, com'e facile intuire, e ritenuta un rassicurante "bozzolo" contro gli attacchi di Covid-19.Il pack D-Fence debutta con le Fiat 500 e Panda Hybrid e, di fatto, origina nuove versioni che all'attenzione ai consumi e al portafoglio promessi dall'ibridizzazione affiancano quella per la salute di chi sta nell'abitacolo. Infatti, aiuta ad igienizzare l'interno dell'auto in 3 step perche migliora la qualita dell'aria proveniente dall'esterno, purifica quella gia all'interno dall'abitacolo ed elimina fino al 99% dei batteri. Il risultato e determinato da altrettante soluzioni. La prima e costituita da un filtro abitacolo ad alte prestazioni per l'impianto di climatizzazione, posto tra la presa d'aria e l'abitacolo, che trattene il particolato e il 100% degli allergeni provenienti dall'esterno. Il secondo e l'air-purifier che interviene sull'aria che e gia nell'abitacolo, purificandola attraverso un filtro Hepa ad alta efficienza che trattiene le micro-particelle, quali il polline e i batteri, che puo anche essere smontato e utilizzato in altri ambienti. Il terzo e una lampada Uv che igienizzando non solo tutte le superfici che piu frequentemente si toccano, come il volante e il cambio o ancora i sedili, ma anche oggetti decontaminando anche gli oggetti presenti nell'abitacolo (pensiamo, per esempio alle buste della spesa) elimina fino al 99% dei batteri.L'attenzione per l'igiene della 500 e della Panda Hybrid porta con se anche una speciale formula di finanziamento di Fca Bank, basata su costi giornalieri paragonabili a quelli di due spostamenti con i mezzi pubblici. Questa soluzione non prevede anticipo, contempla la prima rata nel 2021 e prende le mosse da un costo giornaliero che parte da 3 euro per la Panda normale e da 4 euro per la 500 e la Panda Hybrid. A titolo di esempio la formula relativa alla Panda con Tan 6,85% e Taeg 9,59% si articola in 17 rate da 90 euro e poi altre 72 rate da 146 euro.Nel contesto in cui debutta il pack D-Fence la 500 e la Panda Hybrid sono, sicuramente, i modelli che si pongono maggiormente all'attenzione sia per le agevolazioni assicurate dall'omologazione Ibrido sia per i risparmi di carburante fino al 30% promessi dall'elettrificazione a 12V dei loro motori a tre cilindri FireFly 1.0 da 70 cv. L'ibridizzazione e determinata da un'unita elettrica da 4,9 cv collegata all'albero motore tramite la cinghia dei servizi ausiliari che, nei rallentamenti, recupera energia da immagazzinare in una batteria agli ioni di litio da 11 Ah, poi sfruttabile sino a una potenza di picco di 3,6 kW nelle fasi in cui e importante lenire le richieste di benzina del motore termico. Il sistema mild hybrid delle citycar Fiat prevede anche lo spegnimento del motore al di sotto dei 30 all'ora mettendo il cambio in folle, suggerito da indicazioni evidenziate nella strumentazione, che attiva contestualmente la modalita veleggiamento.

Born in East Los Angeles, Verdugo was a key figure in the 1968 student movement of Mexican Americans who faced physical punishment for speaking Spanish in class and discrimination from white administrators and teachers. The beatings of high school students seeking fair treatment generated anger around the U.S. and encouraged Mexican American students in Texas and New Mexico to stage their own walkouts.
