Amnesty International said Thursday, Sept. 24, 2020, that thousands of Europe-bound migrants who were intercepted and returned to Libyan shores this year were forcefully disappeared after they were taken of detention centers run by militias allied with the U.N.-supported government in the capital, Tripoli. The report also said that rival authorities in eastern Libya forcibly expelled serval thousands “without due process or the opportunity to challenge their deportation.” (AP Photo/Santi Palacios, File)
