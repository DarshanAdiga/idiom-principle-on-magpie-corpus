The Gunners urgently need a signing of this type, however, perhaps more so than Spurs, with Mikel Arteta’s side getting off to a terrible start and lacking spark in the attacking midfield department.
 Szoboszlai may be relatively unproven at the highest level, but looks like he has a big future in the game and like he has the potential to be an ideal long-term replacement for Mesut Ozil at the Emirates Stadium.

A victim of bullying, she said she “was not mentally in a place that was pleasant. It was a dark time in my life.”
 But an encounter at a tattoo convention in Pittsburgh this spring with renowned tattoo artist and “Ink Master” contestant Laura Marie, who provided her with words of encouragement and support, motivated her to “pay it forward.”
 “It was the weekend before everything shut down because of COVID. She brought such positivity into my life, and she’s been a source of inspiration for me,” said Gavlik. “She took the time to encourage me, and it meant a lot to me. Talking with her and doing these projects has definitely allowed me to be more confident in my interactions with people.”
 Gavlik said she doesn’t want anyone to go through “that same feeling of hopelessness that I felt.”
 In addition to making the blankets, Gavlik has donated more than 200 hand- decorated bags and more than 100 hand-drawn place mats to Meals on Wheels, and has created and sent comfort cards, including some 3-D cards.
 The place mats were sent to Meals on Wheels clients on Thanksgiving Day to accompany a traditional turkey dinner.
 “It shows (the clients) that people are thinking about them. They love getting personal things included when we deliver to them,” said Susan Hanawalt, director of Peters Township Meals on Wheels. “It absolutely makes a difference. It was a wonderful gesture, and we appreciated it.”
 Gavlik also filled and donated 200 boxes for Operation Christmas Child, which are sent to children in impoverished or war-torn countries around the world.
 Gavlik has completed those projects while maintaining a 5.4 weighted GPA and adding a perfect score on the math portion of her SAT. She also serves as president of the forensics team and secretary for the National Honor Society, and is a member of the Math Club, Science Club and Math League.
 She also works part-time at Salt of the Earth, a salt cave in McMurray, and she has used, for the most part, her job earnings to pay for the supplies and materials she needs – including stuffed animals, soap, crayons, water bottles and toys for the Christmas boxes – for her projects.
 Gavlik has been accepted to Duquesne University and is awaiting acceptance at other colleges. She is considering careers as a pharmacist, dermatologist, or physician’s assistant. She also plans to minor in Spanish, to be able to communicate with those who might not speak English.
 Gavlik plans to continue with her acts of kindness. In the works are projects for upcoming holidays, including Valentine’s Day cards and Easter baskets.
 “I have this inner desire to help others, and I cannot imagine spending my time doing anything else,” said Gavlik. “I think a lot of that comes from me overcoming my struggle with being bullied, and if I have an opportunity to help others, I love nothing more than doing that.”

Two goals and an assist was quite the impact from a player many were sceptical about United signing. Of course, a couple of good performances isn’t reason enough for anyone to start getting carried away but Cavani undeniably brings a focal point to the team’s attack that has been lacking since Romelu Lukaku was sold to Inter over 18 months ago.
 Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood have all proven their worth since the Belgian departed at the start of last season but there have been occasions when the team has lacked the killer instinct only a real number nine has in his locker.
 Cavani's predatory finishing was very much in evidence at Southampton but it was his movement during his first start against Istanbul Basaksehir that really underlined what he offers to United.
 He didn’t get on the scoresheet in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford last week but he caused the Turkish side's defenders all sorts of problems with his running on and off the ball, which in turn created opportunities for his team-mates.
 “I think it’s really important, especially for me,” Donny van de Beek said of playing with Cavani. “If you come in the box, it gives you some extra space because defenders always look extra for the striker, so it gives extra space for the midfielders.”

High wooded hills hem this section of the river, trapping floodwaters and driving them high, fast and furious. When Lock 7 was removed in 1986, the river rose another 15 feet, threatening Greensboro’s historic riverfront streets. When the Army Corps of Engineers made plans to condemn the historic riverfront houses in 1992, homeowners and the community organized the Nathanael Greene Historical Foundation and went to court to prevent it. Restructured afterward as Nathanael Greene Community Development Corporation, the nonprofit continues to promote Greensboro’s rich history and helps support walking trails, community improvement projects, fundraisers and art-centric festivals. When Potters’ Landing was damaged, Nat Greene put more than $6,000 into the project and Walmart, Greensboro Borough and Ice Plant Restaurant added to the mix. Nat Greene board member Bob MtJoy, retired CEO of Cornerstone Care and avid paddler, began rounding up volunteers to help with the months of work that lay ahead.
 “We got wonderful support from the community,” MtJoy said.
 EQT donated and delivered the 10-inch pipe for the new pilings to be designed, and project donations paid Three Rivers Divers for the welding and the boat it took to deliver the resized pipe and the crane it took to anchor the pilings into bedrock. The new launch bed moves up and down on them as the water level changes. They tower over Potters’ Landing, an eye-opening reminder of just how high the river can get during a record flood.
 Dock piling brackets were purchased, the wheelchair-accessible ramp was repaired and invasive Japanese knotweed was removed. Volunteer Shawn Phillips did the welding repair on the aluminum gangway, and Tony Gashie of JLM Construction donated and operated his front-end loader as the new launch was landscaped into place.
 In August, MtJoy had good news to share with Kayak Greene County on Facebook.

What is especially troubling regarding the disease is that an infected deer might not exhibit visible symptoms for more than a year, possibly passing the disease to many more deer before it dies. As the _Mirror_ noted in an editorial on Nov. 30, 2019, the Game Commission believes it takes, on average, 18 to 24 months for infected deer to show CWD symptoms.
 As the disease progresses, infected animals might exhibit a lowered head and/or lowered ears, wasting or thinning, a rough coat, excessive drooling, or abnormal behavior.
 There is no conclusive evidence about whether the disease can be transmitted to humans, but some people believe that that possibility is not out of the question.
 Although deer hunting currently is not without issues dogging it, it cannot be argued that this annual outdoors ritual does not advance appreciation of the environment and wildlife’s place in it.
 That is true both for adults as well as for young people participating in their first hunt.
 For many young people, the experience of hunting with their father, mother or both will be branded into their memory for the rest of their lives. The advice to hunters young and old, going forward, is obvious: Enjoy the hunt but make safety your first priority. Know what is between you and a target. Likewise, try to be cognizant of what is around you, including other hunters who might be pointing their rifle at the same target.
 For many families struggling as the result of COVID-19’s dire economic impact, having deer meat will be more important this year than what it has been in any prior year.
 Chronic Wasting Disease is an important concern that hunters must acknowledge. However, it is laudable that responsible sportsmen like most here are trying to help the Game Commission make the right decisions, rather than hasty ones that might be unnecessarily detrimental to the sport.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam have been sentenced to jail on charges related to an unauthorized anti-government protest last year at the city’s police headquarters. Wong, who pleaded guilty to organizing and participating in the protest, received 13 1/2 months behind bars. Chow, who also pleaded guilty to participating in the protest and inciting others to take part, received 10 months, while Lam received 7 months after pleading guilty to incitement. The protest took place on June 21 last year, and saw thousands surround the police headquarters as they demonstrated against excessive force by police against protesters, as well as a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China.

In a statement on Wednesday, the UN, however, said it has not been involved in preparations for this movement or the identification of the refugees and has limited information on the overall relocation exercise.
 "The United Nations takes this opportunity to highlight its longstanding position that Rohingya refugees must be able to make a free and informed decision about relocating to Bhasan Char based upon relevant, accurate and updated information."
 It also urged the government to uphold its commitment to facilitate 'voluntary movements' to the island, while emphasising the need to ensure basic rights and services to refugees who choose to move to Bhasan Char.
 On the relocation process, the intergovernmental organisation highlighted its efforts to engage in 'constructive consultations' for a better understanding of the plan but said it remains willing to continue this dialogue.
 "The United Nations has also consistently maintained that any relocations to Bhasan Char should be preceded by comprehensive technical protection assessments. These independent United Nations assessments would review the safety, feasibility and sustainability of Bhasan Char as a place for refugees to live, as well as the framework for protection and the assistance and services they would be able to access on the island."
 The UN added that it is prepared to proceed with the technical and protection assessments, if permitted by the government, which would enable the organisation to determine if it can engage operationally with the Bhasan Char project.
 "If so, further work would then need to follow in order to develop plans and budgets, in consultation with the government and national and international NGO partners, as well as with the international donors whose support makes the Rohingya humanitarian response possible in Bangladesh," it said.
 The UN also reiterated its commitment to supporting Bangladesh in delivering an effective and efficient humanitarian programme for the nearly 900,000 Rohingya refugees living in the Cox’s Bazar settlements, while also intensively working toward solutions for them, including through their safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return to Myanmar.
 "The United Nations appreciates the generosity and humanitarian spirit of the Government and People of Bangladesh in offering safety and shelter to the Rohingya refugees and remains committed to our partnership in a humanitarian response that has saved many thousands of lives and supported many more."
 Around two years ago, the government formulated plans to relocate a portion of the 1.1 million forcibly-displaced Rohingya people living in and outside the refugee camps along Bangladesh's south coast to Bhasan Char, situated in the Meghna River's estuary near Hatia.
 However, the process of relocation failed to get off the ground due to the reluctance of the Rohingya refugees to move to the uninhabited island.
 Later on Nov 30, officials said plans had been finalised to take the first batch of Rohingya refugees from Cox's Bazar to the island of Bhasan Char 'within the next 10 days'.
 The government, at a cost of over Tk 23 billion, has set up the infrastructure of 120 cluster villages across 13,000 acres of the island to accommodate more than 100,000 people.
 Bhasan Char currently shelters around 300 Rohingya, who were rescued at sea while on their way to Malaysia.
 The relocation process will begin once the authorities finish reviewing the list of Rohingya refugees who are willing to move to Bhasan Char, according to Additional Commissioner of the Office for Refugee Relief and Repatriation Mohammad Shamsud Douza.

 Aidil Sharin continued to keep his faith in Azri for the remainder of the season after the Malaysian Under-23 international showed that he wasn't ring- rusty at all, more than proving that he is worthy of a prolonged run in the first team.
