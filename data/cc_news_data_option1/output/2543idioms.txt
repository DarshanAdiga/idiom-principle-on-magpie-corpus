A few days after buying a sweater at Macy's, Erin Chisman returned to get the same one in a different color, only to realize it was 50% off. Upon seeing the new price tag, the Wisconsin-based business owner was determined to save.
 So she turned to the cards in her wallet. "I looked at my terms and I noticed that it did have price protection," she says. "Within three days, I had a check in the mail" for the $30 difference.
 Price protection, a benefit that refunds the difference of a lower advertised price, has largely vanished from many credit cards in recent years -- but plenty of other side perks remain, and your card may even have added some new ones. Here's what to know about these benefits so you don't miss out.
 BENEFITS ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL
 If you don't know all the perks your card offers, you're not alone. Only 36% of cardholders reported fully understanding their supplementary benefits, according to J.D. Power's 2019 Credit Card Satisfaction Study.
 It can be hard to keep track because offerings vary widely, depending on both the credit card's issuing bank (American Express, Chase, Citi, etc.) and, often, the payment network on which it runs ( Visa, Mastercard, AmEx or Discover).
 But if you spend some time with your card's terms and conditions -- or with a customer service rep online or by phone -- you can learn your card's benefits and how they can help. Consider some of these examples and the potential savings they offer.
 CELLPHONE PROTECTION
 A credit card's cellphone protection benefit can cover a stolen or damaged cell phone up to several hundred dollars per claim. To qualify, you'll have to pay the monthly phone bill with the eligible card, and an out-of-pocket deductible typically applies.
 Chisman relies on cellphone protection offered through her business credit card to avoid paying the cell phone company for coverage on four employee phones at her music school. "The savings there (are) between $20 and $40 per month," she says.
 If your card's coverage is primary, it means you don't have to involve your own insurer. If it's secondary, it may supplement what your insurer doesn't cover.
 EXTENDED WARRANTY PROTECTION
 A card's extended warranty protection may prolong an original manufacturer's warranty, sometimes a year or longer, depending on the terms. Regardless of your purchase, the savings can add up.
 According to a 2018 survey by Consumer Reports, the median price for an extended warranty on a major appliance was $131. For a small appliance, it was $19, but either way it's money that your credit card can save you.
 Some cards have stopped offering this benefit in recent years, but those that have it usually cover what's included in the original manufacturer's warranty. To qualify, the product must be purchased with the eligible card. Exclusions may apply for some products like cars and computer software.
 RETURN PROTECTION
 When a retailer's return policy fails, this credit card benefit may refund you the amount of the purchase. Only certain products qualify, and you'll have to act within a certain window to file a claim.
 Shipping the item to an assigned address and paying for the postage out of pocket may be required. Read the fine print to determine whether it's worth it for you.
 PURCHASE PROTECTION
 It's disappointing when a new item is damaged or stolen, but less so if you've paid for it with a credit card that offers purchase protection. This benefit has also been phased out by some issuers, but it's not extinct.
 Depending on the terms, the item will be replaced or repaired, or you'll be reimbursed up to several hundreds of dollars per claim if filed within the required time frame.
 The process generally requires documentation, which may include a credit card statement, a receipt and other information.
 EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNTS
 Depending on your credit card issuer, you might also qualify for exclusive cardholder discounts. Some Mastercard World Elite cardholders, for example, can get $5 off every Postmates purchase of $25 or more (not including delivery fees, tips and taxes).
 And eligible American Express credit cards provide a complimentary ShopRunner membership that offers free two-day shipping. Terms apply.
 So make sure you look beyond just your credit card's rewards rate and fully explore all the benefits that can help you save money.

Health authorities are using a saliva test while working against a coronavirus outbreak in Australia’s second-largest city. The test appears to be less accurate than the nasal swab but is a more comfortable option. Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the situation in Melbourne was “a genuine challenge now,” in part because the better situation elsewhere in Australia made it harder to tell people to stay vigilant. Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said on Monday that 75 people had tested positive in the state in the latest 24 hours. She said the saliva test was first used in a Melbourne suburban hot spot on Sunday. The saliva tests in research were only 87% as accurate as the nasal swab because saliva contained less virus than the throat, said Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, which developed the saliva test being used.

Both laws require abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital near the clinic where they perform abortions in order to continue to provide them — a credential that is very difficult for abortion providers to obtain and that does little or nothing to improve health outcomes.

 Según el comunicado, esta medida se tomó después de que el ministerio recibiera varias denuncias por supuesto robo de datos y violaciones de las reglas en materia de respeto a la vida privada.
 Por el momento, se desconoce la fecha en la que se hará efectiva esta prohibición.
 Las relaciones entre los dos países más poblados del mundo se han tensado desde la muerte de 20 soldados indios a mediados de junio en combates cuerpo a cuerpo con soldados chinos a lo largo de su frontera, en la que libraron una guerra en 1962.
 Nueva Delhi acusó a China de haber entrado en su territorio, una acusación que Pekín rechaza. Miles de soldados están en estado de alerta de ambos lados, incluso si ambas partes afirman que intentan resolver el conflicto a través del diálogo.
 La muerte de los soldados indios suscitó una ola de indignación en el país, que desencadenó llamados a prohibir empresas chinas.
 Los teléfonos móviles chinos representan un 65% del mercado indio, y las aplicaciones de videos como TikTok y Helo son muy populares entre los jóvenes.

This study’s biggest achievement is the development of their low-cost deep-sea video camera, as most technology used for surveying this ecosystem has been expensive and difficult to come by. A large factor of the difficulty comes from the immense ocean pressure which increases by one atmosphere, or atmospheric pressure at sea level, every 10 meters down, making deep-sea surveys only possible with costly remote operating vehicles or manned submersibles able to take the pressure.

The GST Council took cognizance of issues that erupted at that time. It didn't turn out to be inflationary either as was the expectation. There were a number of changes and amendments that were made, so by and large people accepted the GST regime.

Almost four in 10 would have carried on with a bad cough, 33 per cent with a tight chest and 52 per cent with a stomach ache.
 Guilt over dumping tasks on a colleague was the most common reason for continuing to work while unwell, along with feeling like they had too much to do and wanting to be seen as a hard worker.
 A spokesman from Thermalcheck said: "Despite the pandemic and the advice to avoid others if you feel unwell, there are still a large number of workers who will feel they need to go into the workplace.
 "And there are a variety of reasons for this, whether this is because they will miss their colleagues, have too much work to do, or feel pressure from their boss to go in.
 "But in light of the pandemic, this approach to working while unwell needs to change and employers need to ensure the safety of their workforce, as people become more aware about passing on their germs and social distancing measures."
 The study also found 73 per cent of workers would gain assurance from colleagues' temperatures being tested before coming into the building - avoiding anyone with a fever coming in close proximity.
 Plentiful hand sanitiser, social distancing measures and toilets being cleaned frequently were some of the other precautions staff want to see upon their return.

Donors will get their results within seven to 10 days online. The blood bank will also send all test results to California’s Department of Public Health. And while those who test positive for antibodies to the coronavirus will be encouraged to return to donate plasma, donations will be voluntary.
 Plasma is a pale yellow liquid obtained by removing red and white blood cells from blood. The idea behind plasma treatments is to give a sick patient antibodies, immune proteins found in plasma, which can grip the surface of the virus and block infection.
 The blood bank announced a similar partnership in May with Genalyte, a local health care diagnostics company. That partnership still exists, says Van Gonka, but the new testing effort will be done with Creative Testing Solutions, which already performs the blood bank’s standard panel of tests on new blood donations.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House said Monday that President Donald Trump wasn’t briefed on U.S. intelligence assessments earlier this year that Russia secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing American troops in Afghanistan because the information had not been “verified.”Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted that intelligence "would not be elevated to the president until it was verified." However, it is rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of doubt before it is presented to senior government decision-makers.McEnany added that a House briefing for select members of Congress was being held Monday, but she said that even then, Trump still had not been briefed on the intelligence. Eight Republican lawmakers were in the briefing, an official said, adding Democrats were invited but chose not to attend. McEnany declined to say why a different standard applied to briefing lawmakers than the president."There is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations and in effect there are dissenting opinions from some in the intelligence community with regards to the veracity of what's being reported and the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated," McEnany said.The intelligence assessments came amid Trump's push to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan and suggested Russia was making overtures to militants as the U.S. and the Taliban held talks to end the long-running war. The assessment was first reported by The New York Times, then confirmed to The Associated Press by American intelligence officials and two others with knowledge of the matter.While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn't new, officials said Russian operatives became more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012. Russian operatives are said to have met with Taliban leaders in Doha, Qatar, and Afghanistan; however, it's unknown if the meetings were to discuss bounties.The officials the AP spoke to said the intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three U.S. Marines after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan. Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the attack, along with an Afghan contractor. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. The officials the AP spoke to also said they were looking closely at insider attacks — sometimes called "green- on-blue" incidents — from 2019 to determine if they are also linked to Russian bounties.In early 2020, members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group, known to the public as SEAL Team Six, raided a Taliban outpost and recovered roughly $500,000. The recovered funds further solidified the suspicions of the American intelligence community that the Russians had offered money to Taliban militants and linked associations.One official said the administration discussed several potential responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step.The intelligence officials told the AP that Trump was briefed on the bounty matter earlier this year; Trump denied that, tweeting Sunday neither he nor Vice President Mike Pence had been briefed. Trump tweeted Sunday night he was just told intelligence officials didn't report the information to him because they didn't find it credible.The intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter insisted on anonymity to discuss the highly sensitive matter.The White House National Security Council wouldn't confirm the assessments but said the U.S. receives thousands of intelligence reports daily that are subject to strict scrutiny.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who golfed with Trump on Sunday, tweeted Saturday it's "Imperative Congress get to the bottom of recent media reports that Russian GRU units in Afghanistan have offered to pay the Taliban to kill American soldiers with the goal of pushing America out of the region." GRU is a reference to the Russian military intelligence agency. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, called for the White House to share more information with Congress, saying, if true, lawmakers need to know "Who did know and when?" and, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, "What has been done in response to protect our forces &amp; hold Putin accountable?"Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden said reports Trump was aware of the Russian bounties would be a "truly shocking revelation" about the commander in chief and his failure to protect U.S. troops in Afghanistan and stand up to Russia. Russia called the report "nonsense.""This unsophisticated plant clearly illustrates the low intellectual abilities of the propagandists of American intelligence, who instead of inventing something more plausible have to make up this nonsense," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he regretted "the biggest, respectful and high-class international media organizations have not been above publishing absolute hoaxes in recent years." A Taliban spokesman said the militants "strongly reject this allegation" and aren't "indebted to the beneficence of any intelligence organ or foreign country."John Bolton, an ex-national security adviser who was forced out by Trump last September and has written a tell-all book about his White House tenure, said Sunday it's "pretty remarkable the president's going out of his way to say he hasn't heard anything about it. One asks, why would he do something like that?"Bolton told NBC's "Meet the Press" he thinks the answer "may be precisely because active Russian aggression like that against the American service members is a very, very serious matter and nothing's been done about it, if it's true, for these past four or five months, so it may look like he was negligent. But, of course, he can disown everything if nobody ever told him about it."House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the few congressional leaders typically briefed on sensitive intelligence matters, told ABC's "This Week" she hadn't been informed about the reported bounties and requested a report to Congress on the matter."This is as bad as it gets, and yet the president will not confront the Russians on this score, denies being briefed. Whether he is or not, his administration knows and our allies — some of our allies who work with us in Afghanistan had been briefed and accept this report," she said.Pelosi called for a briefing to all members of Congress on the intelligence.Trump responded to Biden on Twitter, saying, "Russia ate his and Obama's lunch during their time in office"But it was the Obama administration, with international allies, that suspended Russia from the Group of Eight after its unilateral annexation of Crimea from Ukraine — a move that drew widespread condemnation.Biden criticized Trump for "his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself" before Putin. Trump tweeted "nobody's been tougher" on Russia than his administration.___Associated Press writer Lynn Berry contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I would like to sing the praises of Art Martin, the executive director of Brookdale Santa Catalina, an independent and assisted living facility in the Foothills. He and his team have managed to keep the many seniors on the campus COVID free. Additionally, the site was part of the Big Horn Fire evacuation. Art worked relentlessly to make sure he had the ability to evacuate the independent and assisted living facilities, making sure every resident would have housing that met their needs if forced out. Luckily through his work with the fire incident commander the facility did not have to evacuate.
 He is now working with Pima County Health to get all residents tested to make sure that as infection rates increase on the outside his residents are still free from the virus. His care and concern for my 93-year-old mother has meant one less thing for me to stress over. Words cannot express our gratitude for his and the Brookdale teams care of our most precious being.

"It is quite baffling to hear Hon Dora Siliya insinuating that youths are using social media to insult President Edgar Lungu. She claims Zambians are abusing social media. This is a fallacy, a claim that is neither here nor there. If there is someone that has abused a president in this country, it is Dora Siliya herself. Memories are fresh when Dora Siliya raised a middle finger in the House, parliament, against the then president Michael Sata, an act that is utterly unacceptable by any standard of morality. Yet, president Sata expressed tolerance and forgiveness towards Hon Siliya's unbecoming behaviour," Mulenga said. "As NDC, we challenge Dora Siliya to provide proof of any youth that has been insulting President Lungu either on social media or any other public forum other than demanding for social justice and delivery of campaign promises by the PF. Dora Siliya and the PF government must learn to draw concern from people's opposing views and learn to improve their ways of governing. There is too much ruling under PF than governing."

MILAN -- When luxury fashion lined up social media posts to show solidarity with Black Lives Matters protests, brands got a whole lot of blowback.
 Transgender model and actress Munroe Bergdorf jumped on L'Oreal's #BlackoutTuesday posts to accuse the beauty brand of hypocrisy for having fired her three years ago when she complained about racism in strong language. U.S. actor Tommy Dorfman, who appears in a recent campaign for Salvatore Ferragamo, called out the Italian luxury brand for what Dorfman called a "homophobic and racist work environment."
 And ordinary Instagram followers piled on, challenging fashion houses to do more than post a black square on their virtual real estate, to instead make runways, magazine covers, boardrooms and creative studios living showcases of diversity.
 Global fashion brands have faced racial backlashes in the past, notably in the wake of scandals like the Gucci knitwear recalling blackface, Prada's Little Black Sambo bag charm and Dolce&Gabbana's anti-Asian comments.
 The U.S protests against systemic racism, which are spreading around the globe, are also putting the spotlight on the fashion world in its role as a cultural beacon, and emboldening insiders -- some with lucrative deals that often assume their discretion -- to speak up.
 "People have the fire under their bottoms," said Tamu McPherson, an American content creator based in Milan who collaborates with top luxury brands. "Their stories are strong and their voices are being heard. If they industry ignores them, they can be kept accountable. Everyone is sharing, and corroborating, their stories."
 McPherson has been working with luxury brands in Milan, Paris and New York since 2013, contributing to digital campaigns, story-telling and in-house diversity training.
 "In seven years, I am still one of the only black people invited into those spaces. That is unacceptable," said McPherson, who urged greater racial inclusion in a letter posted June 6 on her "All the Pretty Birds" website, in which she described the fashion industry as "steeped in racism, anti-Blackness and white privilege."
 "For years, they did not want to listen. Now they are listening because of the pandemic and the shocking murders we could all pay attention to, because there were not any distractions. This is the moment," she said.
 Ferragamo courted criticism when it responded to the protests with a post that said, "No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion."
 Dorfman shot back that people at the fashion house "have said heinous, transphobic, body phobic and racist things directly to me. I called them out every time and they promised to change."
 A person close to Ferragamo said that the brand is committed to inclusivity, noting that it features models of all colors in its runway shows. Nearly half of Ferragamo's Fall 2020 runway models were of diverse races.
 The pushback against the industry has had some early results. Bergdorf, who was sacked as L'Oreal UK's first openly transgender model in 2017 for decrying "the racial violence of white people," has now accepted a role as consultant on the U.K. Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Board to help "influence and inform the brand." The offer came after she highlighted the hypocrisy of the beauty company's June 1 statement that it "stands in solidarity with the Black community, and against injustice of any kind ... Speaking out is worth it."
 The Fashion Spot, which has been tracking diversity on runways and magazine covers, has reported progress since launching its surveys in 2015. The Spring 2020 season had the highest level of diversity on runways in the four main fashion cities of Paris, Milan, New York and London, at 41.5%, only to dip for the Fall 2020 shows, to 40.6%. That remains an improvement from 17% in the website's inaugural survey for Spring 2015.
 New York and London have led in diversity, while Paris and Milan tend to lag, according to the Fashion Spot's data.
 After her post, McPherson said she has gotten feedback from some brands that her appeal was being shared internally.
 "The focus truly is on getting representation of Black, Indigenous and people of color integrated and hired at all levels of an organization, especially in decision-making positions and senior roles where they can advocate, educate and inform decisions," McPherson said. "Now is the opportunity to rebuild."
 After coming under fire for designs deemed racist, both Gucci and Prada last year announced long-term strategies to both promote diverse voices that have not been properly represented in fashion, including with scholarships.
 This time, the reckoning has gone to the fashion world's highest levels. Anna Wintour has apologized in an internal email for not doing enough to elevate Black voices and publishing images and stories that have been racially and culturally "hurtful and intolerant" during her 32-year tenure at Vogue. Her comments came as Samira Nasr was named the first editor in chief of color in the 153-year history of U.S. Harper's Bazaar.
 Supermodel Naomi Campbell -- the first Black woman to appear on the cover of French Vogue -- is publicly calling for equal pay for models of color and more representation generally, while acknowledging that in the past she has chosen to deal privately with such issues.
 "It is not something I call out, because I am personally someone who wants to rise to the challenge," she told CNN. But she said, "in my business, it has gone on for long enough."

If you're a die-hard Emilia Clarke fan like myself, then you'll probably be pretty desperate to know the contents of her makeup bag... and her skincare cabinet for that matter.
 Well thankfully the Clinique ambassador did exactly that for a livestream with the brand, not only sharing her favourite products, but also her entire skincare and makeup routine.
 Who says we can't have nice things?
 Proving that she is one of the most relatable celebrities out there, Emilia also took the time to admit that she was feeling a "bit hesitant" about coming out of lockdown, despite the quarantine measures initially taking some getting used to.
 Not only that, but just like us, she has also been struggling with her skin during this time, "I've been getting some breakouts. I think it's an emotional thing and I think it's probably being inside more than I've been outside," she shared.
 Going onto her makeup routine, Emilia revealed that it was actually her mum who taught her how to paint her face, "She was always encouraging me to put on makeup as if you're not wearing any, which I do kind of like because then when you _do_ want to look like you're wearing makeup, you just add a little bit more."
 Clearly Emilia's Mum knows her stuff, because she proceeded to give a pretty in-depth concealer demonstration that will banish any sign of a late night.
 "I used to always put concealer on first," Emilia said, before explaining that by applying your foundation over the top, you just move your concealer around. So remember, concealer first, foundation second.
 Turns out that like the majority of us, Emilia suffers from dark circles naturally, which are only compounded by her late nights on sets. To combat that she always applies her concealer of choice (Clinique's Beyond Perfecting Super Concealer, £19) with her ring finger and with a very specific technique.

The outcome is not the last word on the decades-long fight over abortion with dozens of state-imposed restrictions winding their way through the courts. But the decision was a surprising defeat for abortion opponents, who thought that a new conservative majority with two of President Donald Trump's appointees on board would start chipping away at abortion access.
 The key vote belonged to Roberts, who had always voted against abortion rights before, including in a 2016 case in which the court struck down a Texas law that was virtually identical to the one in Louisiana.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main coalition partner, Benny Gantz, has signalled his opposition on Monday to advancing a plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians want to establish a state.
 But Netanyahu was quoted by a spokesman as telling legislators from his right- wing Likud party that annexation steps due to be debated by the cabinet as early as Wednesday did not depend on Gantz's support.
 The two uneasy partners in a coalition formed last month were both meeting visiting officials from Washington, which wants to see consensus within the Israeli government before giving a green light to Netanyahu's plans.
 A Netanyahu-Gantz rift might therefore delay a cabinet debate on annexation that both had agreed could begin as early as July 1.

Nonetheless, even with EOP status, Ukraine still has a long way to go to becoming a full Alliance member. A recent study produced by the _Ukrainian Strategic Initiative_ ( _USI_ ) think tank emphasized another important aspect—a lack of important steps taken by the government. According to their analysis of last year’s (2019) ANP, several strategic points had remained unfulfilled, including receiving a MAP, adopting a new law on the Security Service of Ukraine (a vital reform of this organization that would bring it in line with European standards), preparing a new law on intelligence, as well as passing a new version of the law on state procurements that would make the process (including in the defense and security sphere) more transparent and less corrupt. The draft of the latter bill awaits a second round of hearings in the Ukrainian parliament. The _USI_ experts conclude that the slowdown in Ukraine’s path toward NATO integration stems from opposition of some individuals in the president’s close circle combined with an insufficient level of competence among the newly appointed government officials (Informnapalm, June 2). Even small practical decisions taken up by the Verkhovna Rada (parliament)—like bringing Ukrainian officer and non- commissioned officer (NCO) ranks in line with NATO standards—are regularly accompanied by political struggles and delays (Rada.gov.ua, June 4).

According to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCO) more than 100,000 patients a year undergo LASIK laser surgery in the UK.
 It involves cutting a flap on the surface of the cornea so that lasers can be used to alter its shape to correct short-sightedness.
 The procedure typically takes 15 minutes per eye and has a 95% success rate with many patients describing it as life changing.
 At first, Limahl assumed the surgery had been a success, but over the next few days, his sight became increasingly blurred, and alarm bells began to ring.
 “I really couldn’t see properly at all,” he recalls. “My balance and spatial awareness were all over the place.”
 Alarmed, Limahl returned to the surgery where he learned that his poor vision was the result of an “over-correction”.
 He was told he would have to wait another three months before he could have more laser surgery to correct the error.
 Surprisingly, the latest research from the RCO, says that one in 10 patients need to have their initial refraction altered.
 “It was really terrifying,” says Limahl, who didn’t know whether he would ever see properly again.
 Fortunately, the second procedure did restore his vision, but it left him with permanently dry eyes.

Suddenly, hundreds of inmates with criminal convictions imposed while they were teenagers — many of whom still carried their "life without parole" sentences as middle-aged and elderly adults — had the opportunity to appear before a judge to argue why they should be re-sentenced to a term that would make them parole-eligible.
 It was a striking moment for a state that has the highest rate of people serving a sentence of juvenile life without parole in the country, according to the most recently available data collected by Senior Research Analyst Ashley Nellis with The Sentencing Project.
 As scientists eventually learned the decision-making part of the brain doesn't fully develop until well into adulthood, the understanding of how trauma can influence children's actions also changed. Adverse childhood experiences, such as physical and sexual abuse, poverty and drug-addiction, can further endanger rational decisions in minds that are still maturing.
 "Kids are impulsive, irrational, do horrible things at times when they’re young," said Andrew Hundley, executive director of the Louisiana Parole Project, himself a former juvenile lifer. "And as they grow older, they mature and develop whenever they have a strong support system."

Rabies can also be transmitted from scratches or other physical contact that results in a break of a person’s skin or mucous membrane exposure.
 Rabies is nearly always a fatal disease in humans. However, it can be successfully prevented if treatment is started promptly after exposure.
 The Department of Health recommends that anyone who experiences direct, physical contact with a bat should immediately contact their healthcare provider or their local public health nursing office for help and further information. If possible, any bat that comes into contact with humans should be carefully captured so that rabies testing can be performed.

Similar to the visual representations of fire danger using a color-coded graphic, PPHD Deputy Director of Health Promotions and Preparedness Tabi Prochaska says a 'risk dial' is in the works, to be added to the PPHD website. "You can tell whether you're going up or down, depending on how that dial looks from the previous week to now, and it really takes a look at the last three weeks data , but the most recent week in particular," said Prochaska during the Panhandle COVID Unified Command update Friday afternoon. "So, when the dial says we're in 'moderate' or 'high', it's not predicting what we're going to be in that weekend, it's saying where we were starting the week."

MILAN -- When luxury fashion lined up social media posts to show solidarity with Black Lives Matters protests, brands got a whole lot of blowback.
 Transgender model and actress Munroe Bergdorf jumped on L'Oreal's #BlackoutTuesday posts to accuse the beauty brand of hypocrisy for having fired her three years ago when she complained about racism in strong language. U.S. actor Tommy Dorfman, who appears in a recent campaign for Salvatore Ferragamo, called out the Italian luxury brand for what Dorfman called a "homophobic and racist work environment."
 And ordinary Instagram followers piled on, challenging fashion houses to do more than post a black square on their virtual real estate, to instead make runways, magazine covers, boardrooms and creative studios living showcases of diversity.
 Global fashion brands have faced racial backlashes in the past, notably in the wake of scandals like the Gucci knitwear recalling blackface, Prada's Little Black Sambo bag charm and Dolce&Gabbana's anti-Asian comments.
 The U.S protests against systemic racism, which are spreading around the globe, are also putting the spotlight on the fashion world in its role as a cultural beacon, and emboldening insiders -- some with lucrative deals that often assume their discretion -- to speak up.
 "People have the fire under their bottoms," said Tamu McPherson, an American content creator based in Milan who collaborates with top luxury brands. "Their stories are strong and their voices are being heard. If they industry ignores them, they can be kept accountable. Everyone is sharing, and corroborating, their stories."
 McPherson has been working with luxury brands in Milan, Paris and New York since 2013, contributing to digital campaigns, story-telling and in-house diversity training.
 "In seven years, I am still one of the only black people invited into those spaces. That is unacceptable," said McPherson, who urged greater racial inclusion in a letter posted June 6 on her "All the Pretty Birds" website, in which she described the fashion industry as "steeped in racism, anti-Blackness and white privilege."
 "For years, they did not want to listen. Now they are listening because of the pandemic and the shocking murders we could all pay attention to, because there were not any distractions. This is the moment," she said.
 Ferragamo courted criticism when it responded to the protests with a post that said, "No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion."
 Dorfman shot back that people at the fashion house "have said heinous, transphobic, body phobic and racist things directly to me. I called them out every time and they promised to change."
 A person close to Ferragamo said that the brand is committed to inclusivity, noting that it features models of all colors in its runway shows. Nearly half of Ferragamo's Fall 2020 runway models were of diverse races.
 The pushback against the industry has had some early results. Bergdorf, who was sacked as L'Oreal UK's first openly transgender model in 2017 for decrying "the racial violence of white people," has now accepted a role as consultant on the U.K. Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Board to help "influence and inform the brand." The offer came after she highlighted the hypocrisy of the beauty company's June 1 statement that it "stands in solidarity with the Black community, and against injustice of any kind ... Speaking out is worth it."
 The Fashion Spot, which has been tracking diversity on runways and magazine covers, has reported progress since launching its surveys in 2015. The Spring 2020 season had the highest level of diversity on runways in the four main fashion cities of Paris, Milan, New York and London, at 41.5%, only to dip for the Fall 2020 shows, to 40.6%. That remains an improvement from 17% in the website's inaugural survey for Spring 2015.
 New York and London have led in diversity, while Paris and Milan tend to lag, according to the Fashion Spot's data.
 After her post, McPherson said she has gotten feedback from some brands that her appeal was being shared internally.
 "The focus truly is on getting representation of Black, Indigenous and people of color integrated and hired at all levels of an organization, especially in decision-making positions and senior roles where they can advocate, educate and inform decisions," McPherson said. "Now is the opportunity to rebuild."
 After coming under fire for designs deemed racist, both Gucci and Prada last year announced long-term strategies to both promote diverse voices that have not been properly represented in fashion, including with scholarships.
 This time, the reckoning has gone to the fashion world's highest levels. Anna Wintour has apologized in an internal email for not doing enough to elevate Black voices and publishing images and stories that have been racially and culturally "hurtful and intolerant" during her 32-year tenure at Vogue. Her comments came as Samira Nasr was named the first editor in chief of color in the 153-year history of U.S. Harper's Bazaar.
 Supermodel Naomi Campbell -- the first Black woman to appear on the cover of French Vogue -- is publicly calling for equal pay for models of color and more representation generally, while acknowledging that in the past she has chosen to deal privately with such issues.
 "It is not something I call out, because I am personally someone who wants to rise to the challenge," she told CNN. But she said, "in my business, it has gone on for long enough."

A _Spiderverse_ sequel is in the works, and many fans hope it will focus more on Miles (and less on Peter) and deal with race more directly. Before that, a Miles Morales video game will arrive, hopefully with a more nuanced take on the NYPD than the game that preceded it. With a Spider-Man who's a young man of color in a city with a painful, recent history of stop-and-frisk policies disproportionately inflicting trauma on young Black and brown men, it will be a striking oversight if it doesn't.
