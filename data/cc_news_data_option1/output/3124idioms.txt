Arpaio got edged out Friday in the Republican primary for Maricopa County sheriff by his former second-in-command, Jerry Sheridan, in a race that was lower profile and more modestly funded for Arpaio than the blowout campaigns of his heyday. While he still faced criticism over his 2017 criminal conviction -- which President Donald Trump pardoned -- many didn't know he was running until they saw his name on the ballot.

Here you have a brand cash-in that only existed because Warner Bros. thought they could take the IP and retrofit it into a movie similar enough to the entirely original _Home Alone_ and potentially have their own (relatively speaking) pint-sized hit. There are other examples of this that come to mind. Would Andrew Stanton had been able to make _John Carter_ if James Cameron’s original _Avatar_ hadn’t earned $2.789 billion worldwide? Maybe/maybe not. While Fox was always going to try to reboot _Fantastic Four_ (which opened five years ago yesterday), they hired Josh Trank on the strength of the original sleeper hit _Chronicle_ and then allowed him (at least initially) to retrofit Marvel’s first family into a loose variation on that grimdark sci-fi horror flick. And let’s not forget that Hollywood reacted to _Inception_ by remaking _Total Recall_ (which opened eight years ago this past Monday).

Mason Gamble plays seven-year-old Dennis, an inquisitive and often frustratingly literal youngster who makes mischief for his working parents and his elderly neighbor George Wilson (Walter Mattheu back when it was noteworthy to get an actor of that caliber for a movie like this). Based on the Hank Ketcham comic strip (1951-1994), the film was an early attempt to capitalize on the success of Tim Burton’s _Batman_ in terms of finding anything and everything to potentially turn into a movie. The second-biggest flick was _The Fugitive_ , a straight-forward (but obviously pared down) adaptation of the serialized 1960’s TV show about an innocent man on the run and attempting to find his wife’s murderer. That Andrew Davis classic offered a primal hook and star power (Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones) in a high-quality genre package that was inherently appealing whether you knew about the show or not.

Olympic athletes aren’t alone in having their aspirations suspended. The world of sport (with a few exceptions) has come to a grinding halt. College, high school, and even kids’ sports are nonexistent. Even outside of the sporting world, dreams have been put on hold.

In the midst of all this, how can you maintain your peak? How do you emerge exceptional when things return to “normal.”

PARIS - French President Emmanuel Macron has told US President Donald Trump that US sanctions that have targeted Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah are playing into the hands of those they are meant to weaken, including Iran, an Elysee official said on Saturday.
 The official, speaking ahead of a donors conference on aid to Lebanon co- hosted by France in which Trump will take part, said Macron told Trump in a phone call on Friday that the United States should "reinvest" in Lebanon to help rebuild it.
 Washington has sought to choke off Hezbollah's funding worldwide, with sanctions among a slew of steps against Tehran since Trump withdrew last year from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
 "He told him that in the case of Lebanon, the fact is that the policy of pressure or abstention from the United States and some Gulf countries could actually play into the hands of those they are targeting, Iran and Hezbollah," the official said.
 "So it was an invitation to President Trump to reinvest the Lebanese question, because the situation is serious and we should not abandon Lebanon to those the United States are meant to target through their sanction policy," he added.
 Trump has said he will take part in Sunday's conference. So too will British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the king of Jordan, representatives of China and Russia and the World Bank, among others.
 Israel and Iran will not be involved due to geopolitical issues, the official said.
 The French official declined to put a figure on how much the conference hoped to raise, but said money was needed to rebuild Beirut, supply food aid, rebuild schools and hospitals and deliver medical equipment.
 "Lebanon is sinking. We have hit rock bottom, many Lebanese think so. We are here to help Lebanon rise back to the surface."
