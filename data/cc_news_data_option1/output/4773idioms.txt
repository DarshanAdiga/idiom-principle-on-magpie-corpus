Any time there is a swing in the markets and a change in the value of your portfolio, either up or down it is natural for emotions to arise and for you to want to do something to either ease the anxiety (in a market dip) or feed the excitement (during a market boom).

  He urged people to reduce the size of gatherings, saying small gatherings are better than “one big gathering.” State health officials have recommended that indoor gatherings be limited to 10 persons and outdoor gatherings to 25 people or less.


  On Tuesday, the Star-Herald asked if, under the DHM, health districts had the authority to review holiday gatherings, such as parades, and limit them or deny them.

Bobby Lashley has found some new life as a member of The Hurt Business and Sami Zayn is always fun to watch, whether he's on the mic or in the ring. This match makes for a classic big man vs. little man match-up that should be fairly fun. There has been, much like most of the champion vs. champion matches, little build here so Zayn and Lashley will have to build the heat themselves in the match. While Zayn will likely get some good chickenshit heel moves in here to have moments of control, Lashley winning seems to be the likely move as WWE continues to get behind the Hurt Business.

I love Survivor Series-style matches. The five-on-five elimination bouts were always a hook for me, and even as they've been de-emphasized some in the modern era they're still generally what I look forward to in late-year WWE PPVs the most. But man, has this one been a mess of a build. WWE has been all over the place here as they've built Team Raw around the bizarre idea that if Lana goes through enough tables she'll get over as a babyface, and Smackdown's women's team has been a bit of an afterthought. Add into the mess the fact that WWE had to replace Mandy Rose and Dana Brooke with Lacey Evans and Peyton Royce in the most lackluster way and my excitement for this mostly rests on the hopes that Team Smackdown lays waste. There's a lot of potential on Team Blue here; as a fan of Ruby and Liv, I would like to see them look good and Bayley of course is a star. But this is a match that is tailor-made to make Bianca Belair look like a star. Bayley most likely just up and leaves at some point when she thinks it's a lost cause, probably after the Riott Squad are out, which will hopefully set up Belair to get a come-from-behind win to be the sole survivor. The other possibility is Lana ultimately proving that she can get the underdog victory, but somehow I feel like WWE isn't done powering Lana through tables and she shouldn't get the big win until after that.

Bloomberg) -- Mikolaj Milcke is a writer and broadcaster in Poland, publishing half a dozen novels, hosting radio shows and starring as a commentator on reality show “Big Brother” last year. Yet when he’s spotted in his hometown, he’s seen as a menace rather than a celebrity.
 Milcke, 39, is gay in a country where his sexuality makes him an enemy of the state as the government weaponizes homophobia for political gain. After visiting friends with children recently, some received text messages from locals asking why they’re not afraid to leave their kids with him, he said.
 “We’ve been brutally and deliberately pulled into politics,” said Milcke, a pseudonym he adopted at the start of his career to protect his parents. “The worst is that people started believing that they need to not only protect themselves from gays at schools, but also at home.”
 Once a model European Union country diligently integrating with its western allies, Poland stands out even among eastern members like Hungary that have also been rebelling against Brussels and Berlin, most recently over the bloc’s coronavirus relief plan. The last few years have seen Poland turn into one the continent’s most socially regressive states.
 Backed by the nation’s omnipotent Catholic Church, the ruling Law & Justice party has targeted abortion and demonized Muslim refugees. But it’s the LGBTQ community that has been subject to the most inflammatory attacks, depicted as an “ideology” backed by the EU that needs to be eradicated.
 This story is based on interviews in recent weeks with members of that community in Poland. They included activists fearful of reprisals and teenagers hiding their sexual identity in what they felt was a hostile environment. Some talked of the organizations linked to the Church seeking to “cure” them, others the desire to leave the country.
 Five of Poland’s 16 provinces and more than 80 towns and cities have declared themselves free of LGBTQ “ideology” or passed resolutions aimed against sexual minorities. For months, trucks funded by an anti-abortion group have carried billboards linking homosexuality to pedophilia, their loud-speakers roaring out homophobic messages in big cities.
 Polish bishops have called for the creation of counseling centers to counter “behaviors that until recently were considered unacceptable and morally reprehensible.” That’s as the Vatican softens its position, with Pope Francis saying homosexuals have the right to civil unions and a family.
 Some such centers already exist, including a Catholic organization called Odwaga—or “courage” in Polish—whose website offers “therapeutic help to people with unwanted homosexual inclination.”
 QuickTake: How Poland’s Populists Sparked a Culture War
 President Andrzej Duda made opposition to gay rights a key theme of his re- election in July, calling them more destructive than the communists that ruled the country for more than 40 years. His opponent, Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, pledged support for LGBTQ groups, including anti-discrimination education in schools.
 “Stop listening to this idiocy about human rights or equality,” Przemyslaw Czarnek, a Law & Justice parliamentarian and ally of Duda, told national television during the election campaign. “These people are not equal to normal people.” Last month, he was appointed education minister.
 It was after the campaign that Milcke and others in the LGBTQ community said that the gloves came off. In his mailbox in Warsaw, where there were protests in support of gay rights following Duda’s re-election, Milcke found a print of his picture covered in red liquid. It was also on the sidewalk in front of his building with graffiti saying “to hell with LGBTQ.”
 It’s in poorer provincial strongholds of Law & Justice that are more influenced by the Church where homophobia is particularly rife. Yet it’s growing even in areas where the main opposition party is trying to resist it.
 Danuta Zarzeczna, a mother of a lesbian in Wloclawek in central Poland, runs a support group for young LGBTQ people. She said the country is fast turning into a place where they have to hide as the government becomes more radical and the Church diverges from the Vatican.
 The city of about 100,000 people isn’t in one of the LGBTQ-free “zones” and its mayor has spoken out against the government. But a 15-year-old LGBT boy who lives there said more people now think they have free rein to abuse.
 He was used to insults over his choice of clothes, occasional makeup and long hair. He avoids coming home late and tries to sit at the front of the bus. Then over the summer, a group of girls verbally attacked him on one journey. Echoing Czarnek’s line, they told him they’d prefer to be a human being rather than an ideology.
 In September, 50 ambassadors expressed concern about political attacks on sexual minorities in a letter to the government. U.S. envoy Georgette Mosbacher said Poland is “on the wrong side of history” on LGBTQ.
 That month, the EU and Norway followed through on warnings that infrastructure projects in affected Polish regions would have funding halted. The EU has also been threatening other financial aid curbs on Poland for its undermining of democratic institutions such as the courts and independent media. On Nov. 12, the bloc unveiled plans to defend the rights of LGBTQ people across its 27 member states.
 But reversing the tide in a nation that prominent opposition newspaper Rzeczpospolita labelled the “Iran of Europe” means colliding with some powerful forces.
 Poland has always had a closer relationship with the Church than in many other former Eastern Bloc countries. Pope John Paul II, the former archbishop of Krakow, was credited with helping the Solidarity movement topple communism. In 2005, he wrote about how it was necessary to ask whether the European Parliament’s “pressure” to recognize gay marriage and adoption was “the work of another ideology of evil.” No previous government, though, has targeted gay rights to the same extent.
 Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro has promised that several areas that adopted anti-LGBTQ resolutions would receive subsidies to replace EU money. The government won’t leave “such municipalities vulnerable to oppression by the European Commission,” he said in August.
 This month, a petition to ban all LGBTQ pride parades was submitted to the Polish Parliament. The draft legislation was driven by the same radical religious group that was behind a push last month to tighten abortion laws, which led to weeks of street protests.
 In Krasnik, southeastern Poland, Cezary Nieradko is an activist in a municipality that’s now “free of LGBTQ ideology.” In February, he tried to mobilize votes to annul the resolution. At a council session, he asked publicly if the town planned to displace or eliminate LGBTQ people.
 He’s now considering whether to study abroad. “I live in fear,” said Nieradko, 21. “They’re coming up with imaginary enemies trying to evoke an atmosphere of danger—as if we could endanger Catholic tradition and demolish churches.”
 Maks, a 17-year-old from Wloclawek who has undergone hormonal treatment and a first round of surgery as he transitions to a male, also has his eyes on the exit door. He’s planning to study in Scandinavia when he’s old enough to leave.
 “The campaign against LGBTQ is dictated by fear that if more people start revealing their identity the influence of the Church will decline, even though the Pope criticizes this,” said Maks, whose family name was withheld to protect his identity.
 Odwaga, based in the eastern city of Lublin, is trying to maintain that influence. Its aim is to change the way of life so that’s it’s in line with the gospel. The organization’s website states it’s “very happy when those that receive help grow into heterosexuality.”
 In 2017, the Ministry of Development praised Odwaga for “spiritual and therapeutic help for persons with unwanted sexual propensity and their families.” At that time, the person in charge of the ministry was Mateusz Morawiecki, the current Polish prime minister.
 The center didn’t reply to emails or calls seeking comment for this story. The Polish Episcopate, the highest authority of the Catholic Church in the country, said by e-mail it was ready to help anyone who needed it, including “people facing the challenge of sexual auto-identification.” It said there was no special list of Church clinics.
 Milcke, the novelist and broadcaster, said he joined a prayer group in Warsaw about a decade ago as part of research for one of his books. He said first he had to prove how badly he didn’t want to be gay. The healing process involved sports, fishing with your father and giving up contact with the LGBTQ community, Milcke said.
 Therapy was about inducing a feeling of shame, telling young gays that they will remain unhappy and unable to love anyone while scaring them about illnesses and suicide statistics, he said. “This is not a therapy, it’s deception, the breaking of minds and lives.”
 Back in his native Sokolow Podlaski in eastern Poland, visits have become more fraught. He said despite his success as one of the country’s most-read gay writers, there’s never been anything about him in the local press or any positive interest from the community. The local library may have his books, just to balance it out, he joked.
 “My home town doesn’t recognize my existence,” said Milcke. “Those in power created an enemy and started fighting it. People were told that an evil gay person will come and eat them alive.”

At the time of this writing (Saturday afternoon), WWE has not announced any names for this Kickoff Show match, which might as well be called the Get Everyone We Can On The Card Battle Royale. There are some very notable names from the roster not present in other matches such as Randy Orton, Jeff Hardy, Daniel Bryan, The Fiend, Rey Mysterio, and so on. But let's be real here. This match is the kind of thing used at best to make someone look dominant and give them a bit of momentum. The obvious candidate would seem to be someone like Lars Sullivan, but with WWE apparently forgetting he exists again for the past couple of weeks I'm not sure what's going on there (nor am I complaining). This might be a pick that goes way out on a limb, but as mockable as they are WWE does seem to be following some sort of long-term booking plan for RETRIBUTION. A battle royale is a great place to give them a little bit of momentum at the expense of no one else. I'm going to bet that Mustafa Ali's legion get involved and help him pick up the win here in order to give the group a little boost, as WWE doesn't seem inclined to kill this angle yet.

Un cittadino di Montappone, anche piuttosto giovane, si trova in Terapia intensiva al Murri di Fermo e sta lottando contro il Covid. Un caso che spinge il sindaco del paese, capitale dei cappellifici, Mauro Ferranti, raccogliendo la richiesta d'aiuto della moglie, a lanciare un appello accorato a tutti i cittadini esortandoli alla donazione del plasma iperimmune.   La richiesta   «Chiedo la vostra preziosa collaborazione per soddisfare un servizio che oggi si sta dimostrando di vitale importanza per salvare la vita agli ammalati di Covid - scrive Ferranti -. Da tutto il personale sanitario e dai nostri medici di base, già da tempo, è partita la richiesta di aiuto al riguardo. Ora più di allora questo grido di allarme deve svegliare le coscienze di tutti coloro che potrebbero essere potenziali donatori, perché le terapie a base di plasma stanno dimostrando la loro efficacia. Un nostro concittadino, a cui va tutto il nostro affetto, proprio in queste ore sta lottando contro il maledetto virus e, grazie a questo trattamento, al momento sta ottenendo un risultato decisamente buono. Se si considera che non è neanche facile poter donare, dato che bisogna disporre di determinati requisiti, faccio appello affinché telefoniate ai numeri 0734 6252533, 0734 6252536 o 0734 6253135. Anche una sola persona che possa donare potrà salvarne un'altra e così via, innescando un circolo virtuoso».   L'impegno   Una mobilitazione già lanciata nei giorni scorsi da parte dei vertici sanitari dell'Area vasta che rimarcavano come le scorte, all'ospedale Murri, fossero finite, visto che le scarsissime donazioni fatte si erano bloccate. Un appello a darsi da fare era stato lanciato anche ai medici di base e ai primi cittadini e ora viene raccolto dal sindaco di Montappone che fa riferimento al sui concittadino. Nei giorni scorsi sui computer dei medici di base della provincia era arrivato anche il cosiddetto protocollo Tsunami. Uno studio, di cui è parte anche la nostra regione, sul trattamento del Covid con questo plasma iperimmune. Tra l'altro il Centro trasfusionale di Fermo è punto di riferimento anche per le province di Ascoli e Macerata. «Il plasma iperimmune - aveva spiegato nei giorni scorsi al Corriere Adriatico la direttrice Giuseppina Siracusa -, prelevato ai contagiati guariti, ricco di quegli anticorpi che si stanno rivelando preziosi per curare i malati, è efficace soprattutto se intercettiamo sintomatici in fase precoce, ma non ce n'è abbastanza. Lo stiamo chiedendo a Pesaro e ad Ancona per la terapia compassionevole. Dobbiamo decidere a chi somministrarlo».   L'emergenza   Un appello ancor più importante visto che la battaglia va condotta con tutti i mezzi. Anche perché le notizie che giungono dall'ospedale sono tutt'altro che confortanti. Qui si continua a morire di Covid. Tra venerdì e ieri, l'ospedale ha vissuto una delle sue giornate più tragiche. Sono, infatti, spirati tre pazienti, tutti uomini. Si tratta di un 84enne di Grottazzolina, di un 75enne di Montegranaro e di un 77enne di Fermo, quest'ultimo deceduto al pronto soccorso. Al Murri, ieri, i pazienti positivi erano 64 (31 in Malattie infettive, 21 in Medicina Covid, 7 in Terapia intensiva, 5 al pronto soccorso). Quattro sono stati dimessi. Non si arresta, inoltre, la curva dei contagi. Ieri, nel Fermano, si sono registrati 47 nuovi casi. Sempre ieri, c'è stata una nuova impennata delle persone in quarantena, passate dalle 1.756 di venerdì alle 1.847 di sabato (+91). Quelle sintomatiche sono 238 (+4). Ventinove gli operatori sanitari in quarantena (-1). Dall'inizio della pandemia, nella nostra provincia, i contagiati sono stati 3.005, le persone in quarantena 9.532.

However, Judge Ruth did agree to lift the blanket suppression orders to allow some - but not all - details of what he described as a "most unusual" case to be reported.


  NZME, the publisher of the New Zealand Herald, and the Stuff website appealed this ruling in a hearing at the High Court last month to argue that the full circumstances of the case should be reported.


  However, Justice Francis Cooke dismissed the appeal except to make some minor changes to the agreed summary of facts in a judgment released yesterday.


  All other evidence and facts in the case are suppressed, ruled Justice Cooke in a decision which lifted the shroud of total secrecy imposed on the case for the past 22 months.


  There is no way of knowing whether the student would have gone ahead with the plot, or if they would have been successful in executing staff and students in a mass school shooting.


  Such acts of extreme violence are more often associated with the United States, such as the Sandy Hook and Columbine massacres.


  But at an earlier court hearing, Judge Ruth dismissed any attempt to downplay the student's behaviour as "mere musings of a disaffected teenage malcontent", as the student's preparation went "way beyond any suggestion of that nature".


  The judge also wanted to "make clear" any heightened sensitivity following the Christchurch mosque shootings played no part in his thinking.


  Shortly after the student's arrest, 51 people were murdered while worshipping at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. The mosque shooter, Brenton Tarrant, has now been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.


  At the teenager's sentencing indication hearing in September last year, Judge Ruth said the terror attacks in Christchurch were "irrelevant" to his decision, and if anything, the actions of police may have prevented a similar tragedy.


  "I reached a view much, much earlier than the March incident that this was a matter of considerable seriousness," said Judge Ruth at a hearing in September 2019.


  "I share the view expressed by the police that, on the face of it at least, this is a very disturbed and troubled young [person].


  "My only reference to the March 15 episode is that perhaps by incarcerating this young [person] and taking the cautious and conservative approach the court has, it's arguably the case that we prevented yet another episode similar to those that did occur in Christchurch."

COVID-19 antibody test results will be available within one to two weeks in the Red Cross Blood Donor App or donor portal at RedCrossBlood.org. A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity. The Red Cross is not testing donors to diagnose illness, referred to as a diagnostic test.


  To protect the health and safety of Red Cross staff and donors, it is important that individuals who do not feel well or believe they may be ill with COVID-19 postpone donation.


  Each Red Cross blood drive and donation center follows the highest standards of safety and infection control, and additional precautions - including temperature checks, social distancing and face coverings for donors and staff - have been implemented to help protect the health of all those in attendance. Donors are asked to schedule an appointment prior to arriving at the drive and are required to wear a face covering or mask while at the drive.

What all this adds up to is a governance challenge. Without Republicans and Democrats agreeing to find common ground, it will be hard for the U.S. to exert strong influence around the world and to get ambitious things done. When voters are as on edge as they still appear to be, building a broad and sustainable consensus in favor of difficult policy decisions is arduous.
 It’s also worth remembering that our election is watched all over the world, and not casually: Ordinary citizens and political leaders in country after country pay close attention. Because the U.S. plays such a critical global role, they worry when they see us conducting an election that the losing side characterizes as corrupt or in some way faulty. That’s why the statements of the outgoing president and his Republican allies have been damaging. They feed into the false narrative Vladimir Putin has been trying to peddle about our system, that it is falling apart.
 In the runup to the election, my chief concern was about efforts to suppress votes. Yet despite the obstacles thrown in their way, millions more Americans voted this time around than ever before. Their determination to make their voices count despite long lines and other inconveniences was inspiring.

Sydney [Australia], November 22 (ANI): Former Australian skipper Ian Chappell has said that the extra training period for the Indian batsmen in Australia will help them to get accustomed to steep bounce.   India and Australia are slated to lock horns against each other in three ODIs, three T20Is, and four Tests. India and Australia will first lock horns against each other in ODIs and T20Is and then both sides will shift their attention to the longest format of the game.   The Indian squad for all the three-formats had arrived in Australia last week and now every player has started undergoing net sessions to be fully prepared.   "This summer's chaotic, pandemic-plagued Australian cricket schedule may just benefit India in their quest to repeat last tour's series victory. India's enforced period of lockdown - with training allowed - will provide the team more time to acclimatise in Australian conditions than the rushed pre-Test schedule that touring teams normally experience," ESPNCricinfo quoted Chappell as saying.  


  "The extra training period during lockdown gives the bowlers ample opportunity to work out what length is applicable in Australia, and for the batsmen to become accustomed to the unusually steep bounce. A lot of touring batsmen have trouble in scoring sufficient runs off the back foot in Australia. It is not enough to just survive against short-pitched bowling in Australia, you also have to be able to score off those deliveries. Until a batsman proves he can make runs regularly against that style of attack, he will continue to be peppered with short stuff," he added.   Indian skipper Kohli will just be playing one Test against Australia, and then he will head back home after being granted paternity leave by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).   During the 2018-19 series, India managed to record their first Test series win on Australian soil. Kohli-led side eventually won the series 2-1 and now they would be looking to retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy.   The first Test between India and Australia will commence from December 17 at the Adelaide Oval and this match will be a day-night contest.   The four-match series will be a part of the World Test Championship (WTC). Australia and India are at the top two spots in the WTC standings. (ANI)

The Laney High football team was cited this week by the Georgia High School Association following an investigation regarding player eligibility.
   
 As a result, Laney must forfeit games the player in question played and will be assessed a $1,000 fine. Laney was forced to forfeit games against Butler, Josey and Glenn Hills.
   
 Laney was previously 4-5, 4-3 in Region 4-AA and the No. 4 seed in the playoffs and will now finish the 2020 season 1-8 overall and 1-6 in the region.
   
 The Wildcats will now miss the playoffs this season.
   
 "The GHSA decision does not change the hard work our students put into the season or how proud we are of their achievements on and off the field," said Laney principal Dr. Marquez Hall.
   
 The issue in question was in regard to, "undue influence," what the GHSA defines as, "things done by one or more people associated directly or indirectly with a member school to induce or facilitate the transfer of a student to that school.
   
 "Undue influence can occur even when there is no evidence of recruitment. In those circumstances, no school personnel initiated the conversation about transferring schools, but school personnel did engage in actions that induced and/or facilitated the transfer."
   
 As a result of the sanctions, Oglethorpe County, who was the No. 5 seed, will move to the No. 4 seed and play in the GHSA Class AA playoffs next week.

Here's a champion vs. champion match that actually has some heat behind it, even if it's somewhat last-second heat. McIntyre showed up on Smackdown last week and beat Jey Uso, then had a face-off with Reigns before he earned his spot in the Survivor Series match with a WWE Championship win over Randy Orton on Raw. That led into a contract signing segment on Friday that was far better than your garden variety contract signing. We can question the hot-shotting of the WWE Championship to Orton and then back to McIntyre all we want, but it's led to a match that will likely be much more intriguing than a heel vs. heel Orton vs. Reigns match. McIntyre will certainly come in hard-hitting here and we should have some good in-ring stuff here. Ultimately though, this is definitely Reigns' match to lose. WWE is pushing Reigns like the mega-heel star he should be and while McIntyre has been an anchor on Raw, he can also take a loss. That will likely come in the form of some shenanigans, whether by way of Orton attack or something involving Miz & Morrison. Either way, at the end of the day Reigns seems the most likely to win here.

Auckland's Sweetwaters Festival in January 1999 had collapsed, owing millions in unpaid bills, and suppliers burnt by that less-than-sweet experience suddenly demanded money upfront from The Gathering.


  The turn-of-the-century festival was, on the face of it, The Gathering's biggest turnout yet. Numbers were well up but there were at least 5000 forged tickets, and the costs involved in getting more equipment, more acts and 1500 crew made it a risky exercise; one which drew much criticism from former organisers.


  And then, there was the rain. The Gathering's gorgeous unspoiled location was awe-inspiring in good weather but, even then, temperatures dipped towards zero during the night. This time, the whole place was flooded, and The Gathering turned into a rescue mission. One frequent Gathering punter, electronic musician Adrian Dentice, describes it thus: "All these kids had just turned up in their club gear and were close to death. It was hard out. A friend was the doctor on site. He was sending people down the hill in droves with hypothermia. And the whole event was badly organised. The staff were all fucked up and not prepared at all."


  As they did every year, Pitch Black performed the set leading up to the New Year countdown, and immediately afterwards had to help with the rescue mission. As Mike Hodgson noted, tents were flooded or washed away and many were facing hypothermia, so there was no alternative to pitching in and helping. The Salvation Army was drafted in to deliver warm clothes. Police noted that the only thing preventing mass stampedes and pandemonium was the "loved-up" state of the crowd.


  According to the organisers, on January 1 about half the audience gave up on what was supposedly a three-day event because of the flooding and rain and mud. And according to at least one attendee I spoke to, the organisers were lucky that there weren't any fatalities.

US drug regulators gave emergency approval to a Covid-19 antibody therapy on Saturday and G20 nations pushed for global access to vaccines as the pandemic led to further closures in parts of the world.


  With cases surpassing 12 million in the United States, the highest in the world, many Americans were nonetheless heading to airports to travel for next week's Thanksgiving holiday despite health officials' warnings to stay home.


  Some US states were imposing new restrictions, including California, where a 10 pm to 5 am curfew was taking effect.


  On the opposite side of the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to announce that restrictions across England are to end on December 2 as planned, his office said.


  But the lockdown will be followed by a return to a three-tiered set of regional curbs.


  Britain has suffered more than any other country in Europe from the coronavirus, with more than 54,000 deaths from 1.4 million cases.


  In the Middle East, Iran announced it had shut non-essential businesses in over half its cities and towns for up to two weeks and introduced movement restrictions.


  \- Trump's therapy -


  The antibody therapy approval in the United States offers some hope for those infected, though a relatively small number of doses will be available in the coming weeks.


  The same therapy was used to treat President Donald Trump when he was sickened with the virus.


  The green light for drugmaker Regeneron came after REGEN-COV2, a combination of two lab-made antibodies, was shown to reduce Covid-19-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits in patients with underlying conditions.


  "Authorizing these monoclonal antibody therapies may help outpatients avoid hospitalization and alleviate the burden on our health care system," said Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration.


  Regeneron's antibody treatment is the second synthetic antibody treatment to receive an emergency use approval (EUA) from the FDA after a similar therapy developed by Eli Lilly was granted the status on November 9.


  The company said it expects to have doses ready for 80,000 patients by the end of November and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January 2021.


  These will be available to US patients at no out-of-pocket cost under the terms of a US government program.


  But with cases surging across the US and globally, that means access will not be widespread. The US has added more than 360,000 new Covid-19 cases in the past two days alone.


  \- Vaccine hopes -


  There has also been positive news on vaccines in recent days from US firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.


  On Friday, the companies requested emergency approval of their vaccine candidate, becoming the first in the United States or Europe to do so, with trials showing it was 95 percent effective.


  Hot on the heels of these companies is a vaccine developed by another biotech firm, Moderna, which says its product is also about 95 percent effective.


  But despite those developments, there are concerns that countries across the world will have insufficient access to vaccines, and G20 nations gathered for a virtual summit on Saturday highlighted those worries.


  "Although we are optimistic about the progress made in developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics tools for Covid-19, we must work to create the conditions for affordable and equitable access to these tools for all people," said Saudi King Salman, the summit's host.


  "We have a duty to rise to the challenge together during this summit and give a strong message of hope and reassurance to our people by adopting policies to mitigate this crisis," he told world leaders in opening remarks.


  The vaccine progress spurred hope in Italy, one of the countries hit worst by the pandemic.


  Health Minister Roberto Speranza said Saturday that the nation planned to launch a massive vaccination campaign in January.


  The vaccine drive "will get underway towards the end of January when we hope to have the first doses," Speranza told a meeting of pharmacists.


  Italy, like its European peers struggling to cope with a devastating second wave of the pandemic, has recorded about 1.3 million cases and a death toll of nearly 50,000 since the coronavirus took hold early this year.

A passenger ferry ran aground Saturday next to islands between Sweden and Finland, leaving nearly 430 passengers and crew stranded for the night, the Finnish owner and coast guard said.


  The Viking Line's "Grace," sailing between the Finnish port of Turku and the Swedish capital Stockholm, hit rocks around 1415 pm (1215 GMT) shortly before a stopover in Mariehamn, in the Aland archipelago, Finland's coast guard said.


  It said the cause of the accident was not immediately known but there were powerful winds in the region.


  "There is no water leak and no immediate threat" to passengers, the coast guard said on Twitter.


  Aboard the vessel were 331 passengers and 98 crew, a Viking Line spokeswoman told AFP.


  "The passengers will have to spend the night on board and disembark (Sunday)," the spokeswoman said.


  "The ship's situation is stable. On Sunday we will tell the passengers which ship they can take to return to Sweden and Finland."


  Divers were inspecting the hull to determine how to put the ship back in operation.


  "The situation on board is calm and a dinner is being served," the company told AFP around 1700 GMT.


  Because of a storm warning, the company said it had decided to use the "Grace" instead of a smaller, less sturdy vessel.


  In September, another Viking Line ferry, the Amorella, ran aground by the same Aland archipelago and passengers had to be evacuated.
