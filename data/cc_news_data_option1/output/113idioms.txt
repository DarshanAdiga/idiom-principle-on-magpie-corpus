It’s unfair to begin the review of a Meghna Gulzar film with a reference to her father. However, it’s also difficult not to, because _Chhapaak_ ’s title track, written by him, has been playing on loop in my head, even a day after having watched the film. “ _Koi chehra mita ke, aur aankh se hata ke; chandd chheente uda ke jo gaya: Chhapaak se pehchaan le gaya_ (Someone erased one’s face and turned one invisible, while leaving behind a splatter in the air; Took away the core of one’s being with a mere splash)”— by stringing together a few simple words Gulzar gets to the heart and soul of Laxmi Agarwal’s life, its horrors and struggles and those of many other acid attack survivors like her. “ _Sab jhulas gaya_ (Everything got singed)”, is how he ends the song. It is indeed about life turning to ashes for Laxmi (Malti in the film) in the blink of an eyelid but also about how she rises from it, Phoenix-like; how a bottomless tragedy also sets her ashore, helps her find herself.
 Even though she may have changed the names of the dramatis personae and made the narrative go back and forth in time, Meghna is scrupulous in following Laxmi’s journey in every possible detail — her own story, the people around her, her relationship with them, the various situations, challenges and dilemmas thrown at her, even the NGO Chhanv Foundation (Chhaya in the film), that she had been a part of, find a place on screen.

These benefits are making positive impressions on local elected officials, with State Rep. Frank Burns (D-Cambria), noting: “For too long, our region has been left behind, while larger cities reap the benefits of economic development. This project is a key example of why Cambria County is a good place for business, and I remain committed to fighting for jobs and economic growth in the region.”
 That’s true. But from what I have seen, success in 2019 hasn’t been unique to the CPV center. In fact, the project is really a culmination of investment in the state’s energy resources and benefits that span the entire state.
 Energy production in western Pennsylvania has held steady in recent years, according to the Energy Information Association, giving confidence to drillers to continue applying for and acting on well permits. Pipeline operators are stepping in to outfit the state with the infrastructure to deliver the resources to energy facilities like CPV Fairview and beyond, including terminal facilities like the Marcus Hook Industrial Complex in southeastern Pennsylvania.
 CPV Fairview’s operation was a pleasant end to a positive year for Pennsylvania energy production. Bringing on an additional thousand-plus megawatts of electricity can offset the need to get electricity from other areas of the multi-state PJM grid network, with the in-state production delivering savings to commercial and residential customers.
 Pennsylvania is quickly becoming the model state for energy infrastructure development. Private investment and thorough coordination with the state’s communities have allowed the production, processing, and delivery all to come online in tandem, quickly returning benefits to residents, who should be rightly charged up for Pennsylvania’s 2020.

The cryptocurrencies bleed courtesy of Bitcoin's drop from highs above $8,400. Bitcoin is facing acute resistance towards $8,400 but the downside is equally protected. Bitcoin is wallowing in red stormy waters after wondering downstream in the wake of the rejection from $8,400. The entire cryptocurrency market is following suit by posting losses ahead of the weekend session. For instance, all the top three coins are suffering under the hands of the bears with Bitcoin trading 1.1% lower on the day, Ethereum at -1.23% and Ripple at -1.25%.

_Editor’s Note: This is the first in a series about several recycling efforts in the area, from companies who collect recyclables to local residents who used recyclable materials in creative ways. However it all starts with residents doing their part, understanding what is considered recyclable and what isn’t — and that’s where this series begins._
 BULLHEAD CITY — The smallest measures can have the biggest impact when it comes to recycling, if significant reductions in waste ending up in landfills are any indication.
 But sometimes the smallest of items also can create the biggest of problems.
 Many people think if it’s paper or plastic, it is recyclable, but surprisingly that is not necessarily true. It all hinges on what kind of paper and what kind of plastic.
 Jeremy Walters, with Republic Services Media Relations and community relations manager in Las Vegas, said people make common mistakes when it comes to recycling so educating the public about the differences has become a priority of the company — and it all starts curb-side.
 “We do take the metal food and beverage containers, the cardboard, the paper, glass bottles and jars and then plastics,” he explained. “We try to educate folks around some key words and that is, plastic bottles and jugs, you can even throw tubs in there if you really wanted to.
 “So getting people to focus more on the characteristic — being a rigid plastic container — and not grocery bags, or produce bags, is crucial,” he added.
 “Everyone shops on Amazon nowadays. We’ve all seen those crazy air-filled pillow packs and things they stuff inside the box for one tiny little item. Those things are actually the biggest problem that we have, the flexible plastics.
 “With packaging, one of those things folks don’t realize, is that it’s not as simple as just sorting out the bad stuff and sorting through the good stuff,” he said.
 “I deal with folks a lot and one of the biggest misconceptions is that it doesn’t really matter what you throw in your bin, ‘because we sort through it no matter what.’ Or I’ve even heard, ‘oh, I throw stuff in there and it just makes sure people have more work to do and gives them overtime or keeps their job security,’ ” he said with a laugh. “That’s not how it works. Throwing the wrong things in can do more harm than good and those flexible plastics are the biggest issue we have because they have a tendency to wrap and tangle around the sorting equipment. They create inefficiencies and they jam the machinery altogether. So it’s really important folks learn what they can and cannot throw in the bin.
 “I know it’s a tough pill to swallow when you’re the consumer and you’ve got something in your hand you feel like it should be recyclable but at the end of the day, if no one can take it beyond what we do at the recycling center, then it truly can’t be recycled, and that’s the challenge.”
 Cardboard boxes are recyclable; however, greasy pizza boxes are not. Clean plastic containers are recyclable, but those same containers with food or liquids are not. Walters said Republic Services understands the confusion and has taken measures to help customers understand the differences.
 “People who really want to do it right, they take time to get educated on it, and that’s why we launched some of our items like ‘Recycling Simplified,’ a page you can check out on our website,” Walters said. “That’s why we’re trying to launch campaigns like that, to help people understand — and helping them understand helps us back up the process to make sure all the right things get recycled.
 “If you’re the ‘wishful’ recycler throwing things in there, hoping things will be recycled, you don’t understand the collateral damage that can happen,” he explained. “If you throw in, let’s say, a bunch of catsup bottles that still have catsup in them, and that catsup spills out, it ruins the paper and cardboard it gets on and that once good recyclable item is now a landfill item because we can’t recycle it.”
 The good news is that recycling is making an impact and Bullhead City and Laughlin residents have a lot to do with that because of their proactive efforts.
 “Ultimately, we end up with the material here out in Vegas regardless if it’s Laughlin or Bullhead, to process,” he said. “We’re definitely seeing a lot more what we would call diversion, which means that’s keeping material out the landfills. In Southern Nevada, Laughlin has their own little landfill, but we have a really big landfill out here in Vegas, and we’ve basically over-doubled the capacity of the landfill space when we implemented ‘Single Stream,’ (one bin instead of a three-crate system to separate plastics, paper and aluminum) so we’re definitely saving a lot more material from going to the landfill.
 “But the big thing to remember, is that contamination factor,” he said. “Single stream recycling makes it very easy for folks to just toss all their recyclables into one bin, but it also makes it a little bit easier to be careless. That’s why we’ve really got to be sure we throw the right things in there and throw them in there the right way, because we don’t want to ruin all the good recyclables.
 “If you’re the superstar recycler in your neighborhood and your neighbors kind of throw anything they want in there, they’re taking away from all your efforts, and so we want to avoid that.”
 Walters said when Vegas changed from the three-crate system to the single stream system, the amount collected was significant.
 “When we went to single stream, we saw about a 400% increase in participation alone. We had a three-crate system and they were these hand-pickup milk crates and they were for the different recyclables. You had to separate them at the curb and it was picked up every other week,” he said. “When we implemented the single stream system, which is what you guys have in Bullhead and it’s what we all have here in Southern Nevada and in Laughlin, that’s when people started recycling so much more. It’s because you’ve got this big 95-

Sitting in his home in suburban Dallas, Texas, Joe Paul has been penning some of Malayalam cinema’s most treasured songs of late. The imagery-rich ‘Parayuvaan’ from _Ishq_ and soulful ‘Madhu Pole’ from _Dear Comrade_ , are just two of Joe’s songs that hit the top of the charts last year.
 Geographical limitations clearly are not a problem for this wordsmith. “Until recently, there was this misconception among music directors that the lyricist needs to be physically present in Kerala or at least in the vicinity, presumably to know its pulse. That mindset has changed.
 Nowadays, they don’t seem to be that bothered by distance. For instance, during the recording of ‘Parayuvaan,’ Jakes Bejoy, _Ishq_ ’s music director, was in his studio in Chennai, Sid Sriram, the singer, was in California and I was in Dallas and all of us were working real time on group chat on the phone! _Dear Comrade_ was also recorded pretty much the same way,” says Joe, over the phone.
 “The only problem with being so far away from Kerala is that I am unable to physically go knock on the doors of music directors asking for an opportunity to work with them,” he adds.
 Surely, with the phenomenal musical success of both _Ishq_ and _Dear Comrade_ and — to a lesser extent — his other works of 2019 — _Manoharam_ , _Porinchu Mariam Jose_ and _Kalki_ — there’s no need for him to keep asking for chances...? “Unfortunately, unless you are an established lyricist, it doesn’t work that way. It’s still very much about networking. Out of sight is out of mind. Therefore, you need a steady flow of work and to get that you have to keep your name in the spotlight and hound music directors in the process!” says Joe, with a laugh.
 ## Poet at heart
 The lyricist, born and brought up in Kochi, actually studied at the College of Horticulture in Thrissur and is also a management graduate. He now works as an HR consultant in Dallas but he’s a poet at heart. In fact, he has been penning his thoughts into poems since he was in class six or so.
 “My older brother, Jibesh, used to write humourous poems and get many laughs when he recited them for family functions. I started writing poems out of jealousy! He stopped and I just continued with it,” he says. “All this while, though, my dream has been to see my name on screen when the credits roll. The thrill of seeing it there is indescribable; it’s what drives me to write more,” he adds.
 Before Mollywood came calling more than a decade after he first set out to become a lyricist, he put his creative skills to write, sing and compose a number of Christian devotional albums and songs, collaborating with a few like-minded United States-based friends. He eventually got a toehold in the industry in 2015 with _Rasputin_ and _You Too Brutus_. That was followed by another dry spell, until _Queen_ (2018) happened. While the film itself didn’t do particularly well at the box office, its music (recall the songs ‘Saare’ and ‘Lal Anthem,’ and so on) hit a chord with music buffs, especially youngsters.
 “The struggle is real but perseverance pays. I took a shot in the dark when I approached its director Dijo Jose Anthony online and luckily he put me in touch with Jakes Bejoy and he in turn took a liking to my work,” explains Joe.
 Joe and Jakes also worked together in _Ranam_ and _Swathanthriyam Ardharathriyil_ that same year. “Jakes is a meticulous taskmaster and a perfectionist as well. He gives you every last detail of the situation and really makes you think about each word, even each intonation. He is really keen on how the lyrics sound as well. For example, if a word ends with the Malayalam ‘th’ and the next one begins with the same alphabet, then he will make you change to an appropriate synonym to maintain the flow of the song. Working with music directors like him is a blessing,” says Joe, adding that he also likes to take his time with the lyrics.
 “Sometimes, the words flow like a breeze, often, though, I have to satisfying my own exacting standards! And that's no easy task. I enjoy writing love songs the most and I think that’s what I am best at.”

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A startup heavily backed by Hollywood is wagering that you’re ready to set aside YouTube and TikTok to watch star-studded short videos on your phone — for a price.
 The company behind this
 billion-dollar bet is Quibi, which is preparing to offer movies, shows and other short form video designed for viewing in short bursts on mobile devices. It’s an enormous gamble, especially considering that several earlier efforts in mobile entertainment — most notably Verizon’s ill-fated Go90 service — fell flat.
 Founded by former Disney studios chief and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and helmed by former Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, Quibi is heavy on big ideas and Hollywood muscle. It has backing from all the major movie studios and entertainment companies,
 $1 billion invested in original programming and star power in the form of creators and producers from Steven Spielberg to Chrissy Teigen.
 Quibi plans to launch on April 6. It will charge $5 a month for an ad- supported service, and $8 a month for an ad-free version.
 Company executives argued at CES that Quibi will offer the first entertainment platform designed exclusively for the phone. In an interview at CES, Katzenberg said it represents the first time “professional storytellers” have tackled the problem of delivering a high-quality viewing experience on mobile.
 But the big question is whether a subscription service like Quibi can attract mobile viewers — particularly younger ones — already immersed in an ocean of free-to-watch short video on YouTube and other social-media services. It also will go up against roughly a half-dozen other paid streaming platforms from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu to Disney Plus and upcoming services from WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal.
 During the keynote Quibi previewed shows including “Don’t Look Deeper,” a sci- fi show starring Don Cheadle and Emily Mortimer, and “#Freerayshawn” a crime thriller starring Laurence Fishburne as a cop and executive produced by “Training Day” director Antoine Fuqua.
 Shows and movies, as well as other material like news and weather, are designed to be watched in “quick bites” of 10 minutes or less.
 “ ‘Paid premium short form’ (video) has never been in the same sentence. It has never really been proven,” said Seth Shapiro, managing partner at Pacific Strategy Partners. “That’s the challenge.”
 Among other things, he noted, it’s already possible for people to watch those other services in the same quick bites Quibi plans.
 Quibi executives at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas showed off technology on Wednesday designed to make video viewing on the phone easier. For instance, it will let you watch full-screen video whether you hold the phone upright or sideways.
 Filmmakers deliver two edits to the company, one vertical, one horizontal, and Quibi stiches them together with one audio track. Some creators have incorporated that feature into their productions, as in one show in which horizontal viewing delivers a traditional picture — but turning the phone upright displays a view from the main character’s phone camera.
 Advertisers, at least, are on board. Quibi said it has sold out its
 $150 million first-year advertising slots to blue-chip companies including Procter & Gamble, Anheuser Busch, General Mills, Google, T-Mobile and Walmart. Ads will appear before shows and aren’t skippable.
