Jerry A. OliverBrownsburg - Jerry Oliver, the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame Coach, passed away peacefully on Friday, September 25, at the age of 89, surrounded by Ann, his loving wife of 65 years, and his two sons Mark and Bryan.What a wonderful and successful life Jerry had. Born in the idyllic small town of Rochester, Indiana, to Mark and Lorene Oliver, Jerry and his brother Jack had a special childhood that only small-town Indiana can offer. Close family and friends all over town, sports, being taught to hunt and fish by their father, and most special of all — learning the game of golf at an early age and having the run of the local course.Jerry lettered in golf all four years at Ball State University, where he met the love of his life — the beautiful homecoming queen Anna Miller. They adored each other from the moment they met to the moment Jerry left this world almost 70 years later.After college, Jerry proudly served as a tank commander in Europe for the U.S. Army. When Jerry returned from his military service, he made one of the best decisions of his life and accepted a teaching and basketball coaching job at Indianapolis Washington High School; The Continentals! Then in 1965, lightning struck and Coach Oliver led the Continentals to win the coveted Indiana State Basketball Championship. His life and the lives of his players would never be the same. For the rest of his life, Jerry was extremely proud of the fact that in the middle of the civil rights movement, his Continentals triumphed as a fully-integrated squad with no regard whatsoever to any characteristics other than a player's talent and the skill needed to complete the task at hand. He was also incredibly proud that so many of his players went on to great achievements — not only in basketball, but in all facets of life.In 1968 Jerry became the assistant coach at Indiana University and helped guide the Hoosiers for three seasons in the Big 10. In 1974 he joined the Indiana Pacers as the Assistant Coach helping Bobby "Slick" Leonard lead the team in both the ABA and the NBA. With Slick and the Pacers, Jerry became known simply as "J.O." The nickname stuck. Whenever someone uttered the initials J.O., everyone knew exactly who they were talking about.Jerry finished his career managing domed stadiums, first as the Sports Director at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis and later as the General Manager of Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. His leadership was instrumental in bringing the NCAA final four to Tampa Bay and paving the way for the Tampa Bay Rays MLB franchise. In 1994 Jerry was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame — one of the proudest moments of his life. When J.O. decided to retire, the first thing he did was return to his beloved Indiana.Jerry was a wonderful, loving father to his sons, Bryan and Mark. As with his childhood, Jerry taught his sons the traditions of team sports, the outdoors, developing a sense of adventure, making the most of life, and of course, golf. As Bryan and Mark grew into adults, Jerry was intensely proud of everything they did in every facet of their lives.While the sport J.O. loved to coach was basketball, the sport he loved to play was golf. And could he ever play! He was fortunate to play the greatest courses in the country — and he cherished every minute of it. During his life, he had ten holes-in-one, his last occurring shortly before his 87th birthday. Even more impressive, beginning in his late 60's J.O. began scoring his age on the golf course. He did this routinely — countless times over 15 years. He may well have broken the world record for this feat — a feat that most golfers are lucky to even do once.Jerry and his brother Jack passed away only a few months apart, which is very fitting as they were inseparable as kids and the closest of brothers. Jerry is survived by his wife Ann, their two sons Bryan and his wife Julie, Mark and his wife Cathy, as well as granddaughter Kristen Desper, and grandsons Paul, Tolen and Corbin Oliver. In the fall of 2019, Kristen and Adam Desper welcomed Jerry's first great-grandchild, Hayes Desper. It is a beautiful thing that as one great life is coming to an end, another life full of promise is just beginning.Winston Churchill once said that when he got to heaven, he intended to spend his first million years painting so that he could truly get to the bottom of his subject. No one should have any doubt that J.O. will spend his first million years in heaven on the golf course — and maybe even coach a few basketball teams along the way.The family will be holding a private celebration of Jerry's life. Anyone wishing to honor his legacy may contribute to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital or Speedway Christian Church, where Jerry was an active member for over 60 years. Arrangements entrusted to Flanner Buchanan-Washington Park North.

Few filmmakers can bring a rut to life like Sofia Coppola. When her characters are in a funk, whether it’s a Hollywood actor in between jobs, a few lost souls in a foreign place or a Queen, it’s never the stuff of melodrama. She has an eye for the comedic banalities of the everyday like the excruciating awkwardness of a stilted conversation or, as in her latest “ On the Rocks,” the image of an overwhelmed mother trying to nap in the glaring sunlight while a Roomba bangs its way through the apartment. She turns her camera this time to Laura (Rashida Jones), a well-off writer living in a SoHo loft with two young daughters and a husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans) who lately has been distant, physically and emotionally, while launching his new business. Laura is getting by, dressing in a kind of uniform (Breton stiped shirts, denim and a gold necklace) and trying her best to cling on to signifiers of a once simple and nice life. But her days are spent in a rush from morning to night getting her daughters to school, to naps, to ballet, to dinner, to the bath and to bed. Her Chanel purse is almost never carried without a stroller and a canvas Strand bookstore tote bag along with it and her beautiful ceramic Dutch oven is now just for making instant mac and cheese. She’s also on deadline for a book that she has no time or will to write. Her few moments of quiet are spent rearranging her desk and making labels for ideas folders. So it’s almost a relief when she starts to suspect that Dean might be having an affair. He’s on the road a lot, he has an attractive, young and seemingly carefree co-worker, Fiona (Jessica Henwick), and, oh, then there’s the female toiletries that show up in Dean’s suitcase. Suddenly Laura has something else to focus on and her man-about-town father, Felix (Bill Murray), is more than...

Global shares tried to extend gains on Thursday on renewed hopes for fresh U.S. stimulus measures, but mounting uncertainty ahead of America's presidential election and technical problems in Japan kept gains in check. S&P500; futures rose 0.6% in Asia, extending Wall Street shares' rebound overnight after strong employment data and talk of progress on long- delayed COVID-19 relief legislation. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3%, with Australian shares rising 1.4%. But regional trade was thinned by system glitches at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and holidays in Greater China and South Korea. Technical problems at the TSE prompted the suspension of all share trading in Japan. The TSE said trading would be halted all day and said it was not sure when it can recover its systems. Derivatives trading in Osaka was unaffected. Nikkei futures rose 0.5% in tandem with gains in U.S. futures. On Wednesday, the S&P500; gained 0.83% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.74%, even though they wrapped up September with their first monthly declines since March, when mandated coronavirus shutdowns slammed the economy. A spate of economic data mostly surprised to the upside, with the ADP National Employment index blowing past analysts' expectations and pending home sales surging to an all-time high. The U.S. data is surprisingly strong, so that underpins the market. But I don't expect a clear-cut trend in markets until we see the outcome of the U.S. election, said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. Also helping to boost risk appetite, U.S. House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both expressed hope for a breakthrough in partisan stimulus negotiations. But many market participants remained cautious after Tuesday's chaotic presidential debate, which heightened fears that a disputed ballot on Nov. 3 could lead to a long and messy transfer of power. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden talked over each other and traded insults as they sparred over the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare and the economy. Global investors may be pulling back from the U.S. as the election approaches and the political dysfunction in Washington is laid bare, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer with Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. But they also need to take into consideration that a weaker U.S. economy could presage a weaker global economy, which may drive investors to safe-haven assets later in 2020, he added. In the currency market, the robust U.S. data and stimulus hopes helped to push down the U.S. dollar against riskier currencies. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.1733 while the Australian dollar also ticked up 0.1% to $0.7171. The offshore Chinese yuan gained 0.3% to 6.7635 per dollar , while the yen was little moved at 105.50 to the dollar . In commodities, oil held firm, with U.S. crude futures flat at $40.23 per barrel and Brent futures up 0.1% at $40.22 a barrel.

Joe and Laura are up north for a week or so and left their brindle-coloured Dutch shepherd, Jax, here at the cottage,
 For such a big, lean rangy lummox of a dog he is a complete wuss unless he thinks one of his people is being hurt. Then his protective nature kicks in and he will tear the ass off whoever poses a threat. At night, he sleeps in my big black chair and I hear him walking the parapet watching for vandals.
 First, he peers out the big front window, staring into the pitch black to tune his night vision. Then he heads for the French doors in my office, which looks, as usual like a combination library and supply dump. The battle between myself and books has entered a new phase as I wait for a storage locker in Port Rowan to free up.
 When Jax is sure the grounds are safe he slips into our bedroom and takes up station in a closet Peggy has prepared for him. While there, he can keep one eye on all the strategic points of possible trouble and the other eye on us .
 He's a sensitive beast. When Joe and especially Laura are gone for more than a couple of days, he comes down with some kind of doggy depression. I take him for a poop walk a couple of times a day but even that rouses little interest, probably because his favourite stretch of beach is now filled with rocks. When we moved here I had three or four prime swimming holes picked out, all within easy walking distance which is OK during the week but, when the summer people descend upon us, it looks like the black hole of Calcutta.
 Of course, Jax is terrified of water, along with, rain, thunder, lightning, loud voices, slamming doors and, of all things, cats. Actually, he's a sweetheart and we love it when he's here. As anyone who reads my stuff knows, Peggy and I are dog people. But, after Maggie the Mooch and Rudy the Rodent left us, its just too damned painful to have one around. From the moment you lose your first dog, you know the game is rigged. You know the day will come when you have to say goodbye. The good Lord should have made dogs that live as long as us -- a companion for life.
 The kids will be back day after tomorrow. When he gets his first sight of Laura, Jax will explode in a blur of fur, tongue and high-flying drool. But for now he pretty much confines himself to his closet,   emerging to eat and seek the occasional reassuring belly rub or sneak a snooze on the bed.
 He is the most even-tempered beast for his size that I've ever seen and the most vocal, if you understand the code. If he stands in front of you with one foot in the air and emitting a low whine, it means he must poop -- now. He will sit and stare at some goodie he fancies and nod toward it repeatedly until you get the message. A head on your knee and a pleading look mean: Is that a chicken sandwich? I love chicken sandwiches!
 Jax is a connoisseur of canine entertainment. He knows that commercial where the dog jumps in the canoe and has to be rescued by the little girl and her parents. Five seconds into the music and he's in front of the TV, barking.
 And he hasn't been the same since Live PD was cancelled.
