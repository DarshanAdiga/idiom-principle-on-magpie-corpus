Vice President Mike Pence and his Democratic challenger, California Sen. Kamala Harris, are poised to meet Wednesday for a debate that will offer starkly different visions for a country confronting escalating crises.
 The faceoff in Salt Lake City is the most highly anticipated vice presidential debate in recent memory. It will unfold while President Donald Trump recovers at the White House after testing positive last week for the coronavirus and spending several days in the hospital, a serious setback for his campaign that adds pressure on Pence to defend the administration’s handling of the pandemic.
 For Harris, the debate is her highest-profile opportunity to vocalize how the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, would stabilize the U.S., especially when it comes to resolving the pandemic and addressing racial injustice. She will be able to explain her views on law enforcement, an area in which she’s viewed warily by some progressives, given her past as a prosecutor.
 Ultimately, the debate is a chance for voters to decide whether Pence and Harris are in a position to step into the presidency at a moment’s notice. It’s hardly a theoretical question as the 74-year-old Trump combats the virus, and Biden, at 77, would become the oldest person to become president if he’s elected.
 While the debate will likely cover a range of topics, the virus will be at the forefront.
 Pence and Harris will appear on stage exactly 12.25 feet (3.7 meters) apart separated by plexiglass barriers. Anyone in the small audience who refuses to wear a mask will be asked to leave.
 Pence, who was with Trump and others last week who have since tested positive, has faced questions about whether he should be at the debate at all. The vice president has repeatedly tested negative for the virus, and his staff and doctors insist he does not need to quarantine under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.
 The CDC defines risky “close contact” as being within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from two days before the onset of symptoms or a positive test.
 Pence’s team objected to Harris’ request for plexiglass barriers, arguing it was medically unnecessary. But the Commission on Presidential Debates had already agreed to the barriers, and Pence’s aides said their presence wouldn’t dissuade him from attending the event.
 Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, said there is “zero risk” of the vice president pulling out of the debate over the plexiglass spat. He said Pence “will be there” because it’s “too important for the American people.”
 “The hesitancy seems to be on other side,” he added.
 Sabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Harris, said the senator “will be at the debate, respecting the protections that the Cleveland Clinic has put in place to promote safety for all concerned.” The Cleveland Clinic serves as a health adviser to the Commission on Presidential Debates.
 Despite the early sparring, the debate is unlikely to be a repeat of the chaotic debate between Trump and Biden last week.
 Pence is eager to seize on Harris and Biden’s liberal policies, but it may be difficult to shift the conversation away from the Republican administration’s uneven handling of the pandemic. Pence serves as chair of the president’s coronavirus task force, which has failed to implement a comprehensive national strategy even as Trump himself recovers from the disease and the national death toll surges past 210,000 with no clear end in sight.
 Biden has raised questions about whether he will participate in his next scheduled debate with Trump, telling reporters on Tuesday: “I think if he still has COVID, then we shouldn’t have a debate.”
 The vice president is a 61-year-old former Indiana governor and ex-radio host, an evangelical Christian known for his folksy charm and unwavering loyalty to Trump.
 Harris is a 55-year-old California senator, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother. She is also a former prosecutor whose pointed questioning of Trump’s appointees and court nominees and cool charm on the campaign trail made her a Democratic star.
 She will make history as the first Black woman to appear in a vice presidential debate. Democrats hope the historic nature of her candidacy will help energize key groups of likely Democratic voters — African Americans and young people, in particular — who have shown less excitement for Biden.
 It’s unclear how aggressive the candidates will be with each other.
 Both have adopted a cautious approach on the trail, keeping in line with past running mates who, above all, are tasked with not hurting their party’s ticket.
 Some Harris allies fear that a conservative approach will prevent her from shining.
 “Overly scripting Kamala Harris is tantamount to removing five bullets out of her gun before you walk into a gun fight,” said Nathan Barankin, who served as Harris’ chief of staff in the Senate and when she was California attorney general.
 While some Democrats have set high expectations for the debate, Harris and her allies have been trying to keep them low. Last month, when California’s state Senate president told Harris on a Zoom call that home state fans were excited to watch her debate, Harris quickly interjected.
 “He’s a good debater,” she said, laughing. “I’m just, I’m so concerned, like I can only disappoint.”
 Gender will likely play a role in the debate, Hillary Clinton, the first woman to lead a presidential ticket, said during a recent fundraiser.
 She suggested Pence would try to paint Harris as “the inexperienced woman candidate.” Harris will have to be mindful of the double standard for women in politics as she responds, Clinton said.
 “She’s got to be firm and effective in rebutting any implication that comes from the other side, but to do it in a way that doesn’t, you know, scare or alienate voters,” Clinton said.
 Harris has been preparing for the debate in Salt Lake City since Saturday. Karen Dunn, a Washington lawyer who helped prepare Clinton for her 2016 debates against Trump, is leading Harris’ debate preparations.
 Harris plans to focus on failures of leadership by the Trump-Pence administration but avoid personal attacks against Trump, as Biden has done since the president was hospitalized for the virus, according to a campaign aide who wasn’t authorized to discuss debate planning publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Pence’s team has been reluctant to discuss his strategy in debate preparations except to note that he is “thorough” in everything he does.
 Pence has spent the last four years defending the president on a near-daily basis and mastered the art of turning Trump’s chaotic rhetoric into more palatable, middle-of-the-road commentary.
 Aides note that Pence’s criticism has focused almost exclusively on Biden and his record instead of Harris. It’s likely to stay that way Wednesday, but he has not completely ignored Harris.
 In an interview with a conservative talk show host in Iowa last week, the vice president cast the California senator as a left-wing extremist. Pence also said he was “counting the days to the debate.”
 “In Kamala Harris, you have someone who actually was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019,” Pence said.
 “While I’m going to go there and make our case to the American people, and I’m going to take the fight to Joe Biden and his agenda, we’re also going to make sure people know the record of his running mate, and the positions that she’s taken.”

Avram Grant has moved to praise Arsenal’s capture of ‘perfect’ Mikel Arteta signing Thomas Partey.


  The midfielder arrived on Deadline Day after the Gunners triggered his release clause, and agreed to allow Lucas Torreira to join up with Atletico Madrid on loan also.


  Partey is expected to become a key figure in the heart of the midfield after his long-awaited switch, with rumours picking up pace throughout 2020.


  Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant has now hailed the signing, praising the player’s character and consistency levels.


  “From the first time I watched him, I saw a player who was very strong and good on the ball, who understands the game very well,” Grant told SunSport.


  “Even when he was relatively young and inexperienced, he knew what he needed to do in terms of possession and position, how to get in the right place at the right time.


  “But he’s also a very good boy, on and off the pitch, with a great character. He wants to do his job and he is very consistent.


  “Thomas doesn’t tend to have good days and bad days because you know every match what you will get from him, which is his best for the team.”


  The 65 year-old moves on to reveal what he will bring to the Gunners dressing room, before urging the club’s fanbase to allow him a little time to adjust to life in England, stating that he will prove to be a ‘good signing.


  The Israeli added: “He likes to be with other people but is a polite boy, quiet most of the time but prepared to say what he thinks when it needs to be said, not shouting but making his point.


  “It is good for any manager to have a player like that in his dressing room.


  “I’d ask the Arsenal fans to give him a few weeks just to get used to English football, because it is still played differently in the Premier League to anywhere else, even if there are more foreign players now.


  “But he will prove a good signing, perfect for what Mikel Arteta is trying to do.


  “When you need him to hold the ball up, he can do that and he is a great fit for what Arteta is trying to make his team.


  “If you ask him to play wide, he can but it’s not his position.


  “He is a central midfielder, who will win the ball and play the right pass forward and can see the pitch, tactically disciplined as well and committed to his team.


  “And he will make a big difference to Arsenal, just like he did at Atletico. He is a really good signing, just what they needed.”


  I don’t think there is much doubt that Partey will be an integral player on the pitch for Arsenal, but it’s refreshing to hear that he could well be a great character to have behind the scenes also.


  Is it too early to consider Partey as a future Arsenal captain?

For his cult members and other followers, Trump's saga of infection and "recovery" makes him even more into a type of Christ figure, or an  _Ü bermensch_ blessed with "good" genes.

Wake up! We have all experienced this more than once. Yet, in this day and age too many of our neighbors, friends and relatives remain asleep to the world around us. They fail to realize that we are being systematically lied to and manipulated by many groups and factions that are counting on us not to pay attention to their nefarious dealings and their corrupt agendas. Well, it is time to embrace a “ Great Awakening” as a whole. Time to wake up and see who is trying whole-heartedly to force their agenda upon us while we all slumber and go about our day-to-day lives. Prime examples of how we are being lied to by agenda driven extremists is exemplified by the rioters demanding equality for only those who adhere to their Marxist doctrine while excluding everyone else. That is not inclusion. It is tyranny by the few over the many. Our mainstream news sources continue their daily barrage of propaganda that is often (not so subtly) delivered by innuendo and subterfuge. How they flash their headlines often betrays the very essence of the story that follows. It is so hard to find excellent reporting these days that one has to dig through a mountain of manure to find a single nugget of truth.
 Truth is what we really yearn for as human beings. Truth is biblical in nature, for we all instinctively know that “the Truth shall make you free.” When we aren’t being fed truth, it grates against the very deepest recesses of our souls. Instinctively we know that we must wake up and grasp exactly who it is that is lying to us. And, every bit as importantly, to detect exactly what their true motivations really are.
 Well at this stage it is easy to see that vast resources are being poured into our ongoing presidential election. Massive amounts of money and effort to obtain a singular goal, to unseat the current resident of the White House while regaining control for those who have an insatiable lust for power with nefarious designs on how best to continue the looting and pillaging of America’s resources. These enemies of the people, both foreign and domestic, are systematically embedded within many institutions. Corruption on such a grand scale, from global banking syndicates to international human trafficking, they thrive in the dark while we sleepwalk through life. As we eke out a living, they commit heinous acts of pure evil. What a despicable and lost batch of souls they are! Together we must awaken, grasp exactly how evil their intentions are and shine the light of truth upon them. Or, as per their ongoing plan, we shall find ourselves enslaved to their desires. Then it will be too late to fight back since they will have complete and total control of all aspects of government, military, education, law enforcement, religion and even life itself. What the “manipulators of truth” absolutely fear is that the real truth will go mainstream, thus allowing us, the American people, to destroy them all. It is well past time that we rip their tyrannical claws out. As Americans we instinctively know better than to allow them to take one more inch of ground.
 Night is over. Once again a new dawn proclaims our well-earned freedoms. The “Great Awakening” of truth is upon us and it is time to slumber no more.

KITTANNING – Armstrong County officials acknowledged last week that unforeseen changes to the ongoing “dark fiber” communications project could possibly complicate the project’s timeline.
 At their meeting on Oct. 1, county commissioners Don Myers, Jason Renshaw and Pat Fabian approved a change order for the public safety/911 dark fiber project being conducted by DQE Communications.
 Under the agreement, the contract will increase by $36,000 due to complications that arose in installing the lines due to a PennDOT project in Indiana County.
 Michael Mollick, director of public safety, said that the increase will push the project cost to $120,000, which is still under budget for the county.
 However, he added that the delay in work makes the project’s timeline “tight” with regards to completion.
 In other business, the commissioners approved an agreement with the Southwestern Pennsylvania Corporation, which is affiliated with the 10-county Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission.
 The two-year pact will provide reimbursement of around $13,000 per year to Armstrong County for work by the county’s Department of Planning and Development.
 The commissioners also gave approval to a two-year agreement between the county and the American Legion Home Association for the use of the legion hall in Dayton by Dayton Senior Center.

 TORONTO - It’s been a banner week for Writers’ Trust Fiction Prize finalist Gil Adamson.
 The Writers’ Trust announced on Wednesday that the Toronto author’s sophomore novel, “Ridgerunner,” published by House of Anansi Press, is one of five books up for the $50,000 honour.
 Adamson’s western-meets-mystery also secured a spot on the Scotiabank Giller Prize short list on Monday.
 The Writers’ Trust Fiction Prize winner will be named at a virtual event on Nov. 19. Each finalist receives $5,000.
 Acclaimed writer Thomas King from Guelph, Ont., is among the authors vying for the literary prize with his anti-travelogue “Indians on Vacation,” from HarperCollins Publishers.
 Also in the running are debut novelists Maria Reva, Michelle Good and Zsuzsi Gartner.
 Vancouver-raised, Texas-based Reva, who received the RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers in 2018, has graduated to the big leagues with a nomination for her novel-in-stories set in Soviet-era Ukraine, “Good Citizens Need Not Fear,” published by Knopf Canada.
 Good, a Cree writer and lawyer, earned a nod for “Five Little Indians,” from HarperCollins Publishers. The book follows a group of residential school survivors grappling with their traumatic pasts while trying to forge new lives in Vancouver.
 Gartner, Vancouver-based author of the 2011 Giller-nominated short story collection “Better Living through Plastic Explosives,” is being recognized for her long-form talents in “The Beguiling.” Published by Hamish Hamilton Canada, the gothic-inflected read centres on a lapsed Catholic thrust into the role of confessor for strangers’ sins.
 The short list was selected by a jury composed of writers Elisabeth de Mariaffi, Waubgeshig Rice and Yasuko Thanh. Organizers say 123 titles from 61 publishers were submitted for consideration.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 7, 2020.

  But it remains to be seen if either incident will have an impact on voters already casting their ballots in North Carolina.

  Emma Schambach, a student and a Republican North Carolina voter, said her phone notifications wouldn't stop on Friday as the Tillis and Cunningham news broke. Asked if she thought Tillis' Covid-19 diagnosis would have any bearing on her decision to vote for him, she said it wouldn't.


  "I think that his campaign has been very responsible with wearing the masks and trying to maintain the social distance," Schambach said. "And I think that it is expected statistically that at some point somebody was going to get sick on the campaign. And it's just unfortunate, and we're keeping it in our prayers."


  Larry Shaheen, Jr., a GOP consultant in Charlotte, said the bigger issue is the one facing the Cunningham campaign -- and that could present an opportunity to sway undecided voters.


  "I would not be hitting the fact that he had an affair," Shaheen tells CNN. "It would be about can you trust Cunningham? And the question the answer to that is unequivocally no."


  Aisha Dew, a Democratic political strategist disagreed, saying Cunningham still had a strong platform -- and citing Trump's election, despite allegations of sexual misconduct.


  "At the end of the day, a lot of suburban women still chose to actually vote for Donald Trump with all of, with a lot of really bad information out prior to that election," Dew said. "They're making decisions about what's happening in the voters home, in the people's home, and their ability to live and have the access to health care they need, especially during a time like Covid."

I don’t have cabin fever exactly, but I’m willing to take a short road trip at the drop of a hat these days. I justify it by saying that I’m only doing it for the benefit of L-V readers. The folks between the Punxsy Road and Mahoning Dam have been blessed by my presence a lot lately.
 It’s part of my continuing education, you see. When I was a kid, my dad and grandfather tended to take the shortest route to get anywhere, and I missed seeing the sights along the way. In the past two or three years, I’ve been places I’d only heard of in myth and legend.
 This past weekend, I drove over to Smicksburg to cover their fall festival. It wasn’t one of those long and leisurely afternoon rambles that I like, no thanks to the pandemic, but it was enough to clear the cobwebs from my head.
 There was one farmhouse along the way that caught my interest. I’ve probably driven past it a few dozen times in the past two years but never noticed it. Fortunately, I was behind a slow pickup truck and had a chance to look at the countryside.
 Built into a hillside, the main entrance was level with the lane leading to the barn and outbuildings. The basement wasn’t a low and creepy place but rather the real first floor of the house. Half nestled into the hillside, the entrance opened out onto a sloping backyard with access to nearby fields.
 I didn’t stop and ask to see the interior. That’s kind of rude even in normal times and 2020 is anything but. Still, I’d bet good money that that basement level used to be the place where milk cans were kept and butter was made.
 I would bet that there’s an old well or spring that used to flow through a trough down there. Stone walls and running water would keep dairy products and other perishables fresh, a refrigerator before there was such a thing.
 I think about stuff like this at odd times. I remember having a conversation with Brenda Shilling one night about old-time recipes instructing the cook to place her pudding or cheesecake in a cool place until dinnertime. Even in the 1920s, ice boxes were rare in rural households and a basement with a spring trough would have been common.
 That’s all quaint and picturesque, but I still think that these are the good old days.
 Still, there was an air of calm hard work about that farm. No matter who goes to the hospital in a distant city because he finally caught COVID-19, the cows still need to be milked and fed.
 You can’t get much more real and necessary than that.
 Amid all the brouhaha of the 24/7 news cycle, real people are living their very real lives. Drama may come in the form of a sick cow or a farmer with a bad type of cancer. But the cows still need to be milked and the crops harvested between chemo treatments.
 Now that there are a few coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, folks have stopped losing their minds over face masks so much and started arguing about who should receive a vaccination first. Long lists of priorities started appearing the other day, and farmers weren’t even listed.
 Nor were truck drivers, convenience and grocery store clerks or snowplow drivers. What would we do without the people who keep us fed, who repair our heating systems and appliances, who put up with our insanity when there is no toilet paper on the shelves?
 We can argue about Black Lives Matter, civil unrest, hidden tax returns and on the evening news until we are blue in the face. It doesn’t do our essential neighbors a bit of good. And they’re usually too busy to argue about tomfoolery anyway.
 When mass vaccinations are possible, I think we need to make sure that our farmers and other agricultural workers are near the top of the list. Otherwise, our health care workers and emergency responders aren’t going to have anything to eat, not to mention the rest of us.
 We have already seen what has happened to the meat supply after several packing plants were shut down because of the virus. There are spot shortages of other foods, too. Agricultural workers are not immune, either.
 There seem to be just so many numbers scarcely worth a thought after their dubious five minutes of fame on national television. They’re just low-level workers who can be replaced easily right? Wrong.
 I’m not comfortable with the idea of putting down a head of beef and butchering the carcass by myself. I could probably manage to milk a cow by hand, but neither the beastie nor I would be happy about it. I’d rather let the professionals do it.
 Let’s move the farmers and ag workers up the worthiness scale and make sure they get the protection they need.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnamese authorities arrested a prominent dissident and blogger on Wednesday, hours after Vietnam and the United States finished an annual human rights dialogue.
 State media said Pham Doan Trang was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City and accused of “producing, possessing and spreading documents and materials to oppose the state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.”
 The state-owned Thanh Nien newspaper said the charge is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
 Trang, 42, who used to be a journalist for several state media outlets, is known for her outspokenness on topics including gender equality, human rights and democracy.
 She was among several activists who were invited in 2016 to meet with then-U.S. President Barack Obama when he visited Vietnam. She was absent at the meeting and later said on Facebook that Vietnamese security personnel prevented her from attending.
 Human Rights Watch condemned Trang's arrest. “Every day she spends behind bars is a grave injustice that violates Vietnam’s international human rights commitments and brings dishonor to the government,” the group's deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, said in a statement.
 Vietnam's Communist government does not tolerate dissent. A number of democracy activists are arrested and jailed each year.
 The U.S. and Vietnam held their annual human rights dialogue in a virtual session on Tuesday. The U.S. said the three-hour talks addressed the importance of progress in the rule of law and freedom of expression.

I left the park, walked past one of the historic churches of Darien, and then down a small dirt road I never would have tried without this tip. At the end of the road, two large refrigerator trucks were idling by the dock and a shrimp boat was being unloaded. No one seemed to care that I was there, close to the action. I was transfixed by the shrimper on the boat shoveling shrimp into large buckets that were mechanically hoisted and poured into a trough where another man sorted the shrimp from the ice. Then, with the push of a button, many pounds of shrimp slid down a chute into an open building where other men were at work sorting and boxing them for storage in the waiting trucks. I then understood the man with the beer: He had most likely just gotten off the shrimp boat, his shift finished. Judging from the catch I saw unloading, he deserved that beer!

But we should be as cynical about prosecutorial decisions as we are about the impunity that American elites typically enjoy. After four years of attacking blue states, Trump doesn't have a lot of friends in high places in states like New York or California. Prosecuting a historically unpopular authoritarian like Trump would be a career-making move in those states. It would make a prosecutor into an overnight star among their constituents and put their name on the national map. Professional ambition is probably the best reason to think that Trump may end up being the rare powerful political figure who pays a price for tax evasion and fraud.

Shado beni, culantro, Chinese parsley, Mexican coriander, long leaf coriander and saw tooth coriander are herbs with a similar flavour to the more common and readily available coriander or cilantro. It's a flavour vital to many cuisines - Mexican, South American, Indian, Asian, Caribbean - and loved the world over, but for a substantial chunk of the population, it tastes like dish soap. Haters have a gene that lets their taste buds perceive a chemical in the plant that's used in soaps. Curiously, that gene can switch on and off throughout a person's life; a hater can become a lover. Coriander also refers to the citrusy seeds of the plant, which are dried and used whole or ground.

I am endorsing Gary Forcier to be re-elected as our mayor! I have known Gary Forcier for most of my life and worked with him for decades as members of the Hutchinson Fire Department. He is a lifelong resident of Hutchinson, a successful businessman and dedicated supporter of this community, both in his vocation and volunteerism, who cannot be manipulated. Trust me, I have tried.


  His core belief regarding Hutchinson is to provide for a strong infrastructure so that the community can prosper. He wants to be very conservative where and how the city spends its money. His voting record has proved that. He is still only one vote, so the more liberal spenders on the council have approved some spending in the past that he did not approve of. More people like Gary would allow this city to have great services and an environment that fosters growth and quality of life without spending our tax money on capital expenditures that only benefit the special interest groups, and not the majority of the citizens.


  You can trust Gary to do the right thing! Gary will not bloviate, and you will understand clearly what he understands about a subject.


  Gary was voted an officer of the fire department because the members trusted the decisions he made would not jeopardize their lives. You can vote for him with that same confidence that he has your back. Please re-elect Gary Forcier as our mayor on Nov. 3.

Three weeks ago, volleyball players around the state didn’t expect to have a season until spring 2021. Then came a reversal Sept. 21 from the Minnesota State High School League, resurrecting the fall 2020 season and sending coaches, administrators and players scrambling to make plans.


  The Hutchinson Tigers went from 0 to 60 in two weeks, organizing a 14-match, seven-week season as quickly as possible. It’s not ideal, and there will likely be kinks to work out when the season begins at 7 p.m. Thursday with a match against Holy Family Catholic. But none of that matters to the Tigers. They were just glad to be back in the gym.


  “It was kind of surprising at first,” senior Aubrey Brunkhorst said about the decision to bring volleyball back this fall. “We were all pretty hopeful for it. We had a practice week before that, so that helped a little to get us into the swing and back into volleyball. We’re just excited now.”


  “It was pretty exciting,” said senior Marissa Kalenberg. “We didn’t think we were going to have a normal season, which obviously we’re not. But at least we’re going to have a season, and that’ll be fun.”


  With a limit of 14 matches this year, the math worked out well for the Wright County Conference East, which has eight teams. Hutchinson will play Holy Family Catholic, Mound Westonka, New Prague, Waconia, Jordan, Delano and Orono twice.


  “I like the schedule, because you really will find who the true conference champion is,” Hutchinson coach Dennis Piechowski said.


  Another unique twist to the schedule is that, in most cases, the Tigers will play the same team in the same week, with only a day or two between matches. That should make for an interesting dynamic this season.


  “I’m looking forward to see how that works,” Piechowski said. “Both teams are in the same boat, so if you had a bad game on Tuesday night and you’re playing Wednesday night, well, let’s see how you change the next night. It will be interesting.”


  Another twist to the season caused by COVID-19 is that because volleyball is played indoors, no spectators are allowed in the gym. Piechowski said he and others are working on ways to allow fans to watch home and away matches live on Facebook or a YouTube channel, and perhaps even on the Hutchinson Community Video Network. Look for more information about that on the Leader’s website as the details become more clear.


  What is clear, however, is that there will be no fans in the gym. Without them, Piechowski said, the Tigers must learn to pump themselves up, because they won’t have a rowdy crowd in the student section to feed off.


  “We have to practice having energy, being loud, talkative, having fun, because we’re going to have to bring our own energy, whether it’s home or away,” he said. “And I think teams that can bring their own energy, they’re going to have the upper hand and be more successful.”


  One thing Piechowski is not concerned about is having the players ready. Despite a bit of whiplash from having their expectations for the season changed, he believes the players are ready to go. He’s more concerned about having himself ready to go.


  Unlike last year, when Piechowski knew he had a big group of varsity returners back, the 2020 Tigers have a lot of shoes to fill after graduating seven players.


  “We’ve got a lot of open positions that we’re trying to figure out, OK, who’s going to go where,” Piechowski said.


  “We only have three returning varsity (players) that have actually experienced varsity,” Brunkhorst said. “There are spots to fill. We lost height last year in the middle, so that will be a spot for the underclassmen to step up and show their game.”


  The three varsity returners are: Brunkhorst, who will spend time as a middle and outside hitter; Adri Rhoda, a junior outside hitter who can also move to the middle; and Alyssa Stamer, who played defensive specialist last year but is shifting to setter.


  What Hutchinson lacks in varsity experience, Piechowski hopes it makes up for with sheer numbers. The Tigers have a big group of underclassmen this year, including a freshmen class of about 15 kids.


  “It’s been awhile since we’ve had that,” Piechowski said about the big group of young players. “So everybody’s vying. We’re looking at freshmen, we’re looking at sophomores and juniors, those kids that played JV last year, maybe played a little freshman. Can they fill the holes that we have? With three returners, we’ve got to come up with about six or seven more players to fill out our varsity to get things going.”

Does your daughter often end up short on her pocket money or monthly allowance? Does she know the meaning and importance of budgeting? Being dependent on you financially, your daughter does not have many financial responsibilities to shoulder. She may be utilising her allowance or income on the things she fancies, and if they fall short, she has you to turn to. While you might be a doting parent who does not say 'No' to your daughter, it is important that you teach her the importance of money and how to budget her expenses. Budgeting would not only make your daughter financially aware; it would also help her save. So, if your daughter has her own personal expenses, ask her to make a budget for them when the month starts. She can record her budget on her computer, tablet or even Smartphone and refer to it occasionally to find out how successful she is in maintaining it. She might fail at first, but Rome was not built in a day. Encourage her to keep at it, and slowly and steadily, she would get the hang of budgeting her expenses and saving a part of her allowance or income.

NEW BETHLEHEM – The future of remote education at Redbank Valley in the wake of the pandemic was a major point of discussion among district officials earlier this week.
 At Monday night’s meeting, the eight board members present — including board members Dr. Don Nair and Darren Bain who participated by phone — heard numbers related to both student performance and district costs of online education.
 “We’re just monitoring all the grades before calculating them for the first nine weeks,” high school principal Amy Rupp said in her report. “It’s the students who are remote who aren’t doing well.”
 District Superintendent Dr. John Mastillo noted that not all online students were falling behind, but that the trend was there.
 “[Among elementary students] we are seeing ups and kids who are on the mark,” he said, noting, however, that while they are “maintaining on remote,” he believes not all students are where they should be.
 Mastillo further explained that there have already been some conversations with some of the at-risk students and many are planning to return to in-class instruction. Currently, there are 65 high school students, 25 intermediate students and 21 primary students enrolled in online education.
 Turning his attention to the district’s cost for external cyber school tuition, Mastillo said that enrollment for special education and regular education tuition increased for external cybers.
 “They did go up $218.51 for regular ed and almost $1,000 for special ed,” he said, explaining what the increase means for the district. “Preliminary figures based on the September billing puts us about $300,000 in the red to cover all of our external cyber if those students remain in external cyber all year long.”
 He did point out, however, that there was a possibility that the amount could be reduced a bit following some necessary adjustment.
 “There are a few [students] in there that were listed in attendance in June and July,” he said. “I have to send letters to those cyber schools and refute those charges.”
 The board then discussed the possibility of covering the cost of the district’s cyber program by reallocating money previously designated for the purchase of Chromebooks for district students.
 Noting that several Chromebooks were still on back order, board member Dr. Chad Shaffer asked how necessary the pending order still was to the ongoing needs of the school.
 Mastillo responded that of the outstanding order, 95 Chromebooks were required for the ninth-graders and were imperative.
 “The rest of that order is to go to one-on-one K-8,” he said. “I think our students will benefit from them, but unfortunately we haven’t had them up to this point.”
 Pointing out that the computers were ordered as a result of grant money designated for pandemic-related expenses, Shaffer asked whether it was feasible to cancel the order and re-allocate the money for cyber expenses.
 “We budgeted [the money] to go that direction because we saw a use for it, but now we have these cyber expenses that are far exceeding what we imagined,” Shaffer said.
 Mastillo said two points to consider were whether the order could be canceled and whether the money could be used to cover the cyber expenses.

"How do you choose between working and providing for your family, and your child's education? I mean, what is your priority?" says Patricia Rivera, a former Chicago Public Schools social worker and founder of Chicago HOPES For Kids, an afterschool program for homeless youth.
 Rivera points out that many homeless shelters don't allow parents to leave their children while they go to work. In the past, kids have simply gone to school or parents have found low-cost childcare. But, because of the pandemic, those options have disappeared for many families.
 Parents and caregivers experiencing homelessness are also more likely to work low-wage jobs that cannot be done remotely and that offer little schedule flexibility.
 In May, Vanessa Shefer felt torn between her job at Dollar Tree and helping her kids with remote learning. "It was just getting crazy," she remembers. She would work from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. "When the kids were having to log on, I just had to trust that that's what was happening there."

“I’d never seen one so close up – and certainly never in the middle of town. We see these animals quite far out at sea and so we don’t know much about them. You don’t know if they’re dangerous or if they could attack someone. But what we saw here was that the animal was scared.”

With shoreline erosion not slowing down, Chatham-Kent councillors voted Monday night to move ahead with widening the scope of an environmental assessment for Talbot Trail.


  But that report likely won't be ready until the late summer or early fall of 2021, and any potential construction would not be starting until 2023.


  The scope change, valued at $201,422, brings the total cost of the assessment to $421,038, with BT Engineering Inc. performing the work.


  "It's going to provide us with that overall recommendation for all of Talbot Trail," said Chris Thibert, director of engineering and transportation. "The recommendation will then fall into our capital plan subject to budget in 2022."


  According to Monday's staff report, the zone of shoreline failure has increased since the release of the initial request for proposal, with the Lake Erie shoreline study identifying the limits of failure will extend to the east in the future.


  The environmental assessment will now include the shoreline east towards Cedar Springs.


  The initial request for proposal began in January to consider alternatives for either:


  Rehabilitation of the existing corridor to address the issue of road failure/slope instability; or


  Road realignment/road reclassification that would offset Talbot Trail from the zone of shoreline erosion.


  This area included shoreline from approximately Zion Road to Port Road, which includes the failure location just east of Coatsworth Road.


  In July 2019, the portion of Talbot Trail near Coatsworth was closed. In 2010, the municipality had to build a $200,000 bypass in the same area after nearby bank erosion caused a major crack in the road.


  In consultation with BT Engineering, the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks won't accept completing the environmental assessment in two studies because the recommendations are interrelated, the report added, as historically the ministry hasn't allowed "piece-mealing" the assessment into smaller pieces of a larger study area.


  The recommendation would extend the study area from Port Road to east of County Road 12 to allow for the connections to the east that connect to Blenheim and nearby communities.


  Thomas Kelly, general manager of infrastructure and engineering, cautioned the shoreline study would forecast a hefty price tag for any fix for Talbot Trail.


  He said the municipality also shouldn't count on senior government funding at this time.


  "It's been discussed, but there's no funding available from upper levels," Kelly said. "That's the answer we've received for quite some time now. Certainly, COVID has put a lot of stress as well into the system.


  "I'm really not optimistic that we're going to hear of any announcements in the short horizon either."


  Coun. Trevor Thompson said constituents are curious about what's next. While the expected cost is significant, so is the impact on residents and businesses, he added.


  The detour also takes a cumulative toll, especially on farmers, he said.


  "Speaking to a tomato farmer who runs tomatoes up and down Talbot, that bypass, although a short one, adds a full hour or two to his day," he said. "When you're doing five or six runs, it becomes quite substantial.


  "Yes, the funding is significant and a challenge, but I think the current status quo is definitely a challenge. Its significance can't be underemphasized as well."

Josh Jacobs was the Raiders' most impressive offensive player against the Chiefs last year when the rookie averaged more than 101 rushing yards per game. As a rookie, Jacobs was able to slash his way through Kansas City's defense. He gained 99 yards in the first game on 12 carries (8.25 yards per carry), and then he backed that up with 104 yards rushing on 17 carries (6.12). Still, Jacobs' chances of gashing K.C.'s defense would improve dramatically if right tackle Trent Brown (calf) could return this week. Jacobs is coming off a 48-yard effort in the loss to Buffalo, his third-lowest yardage total in his brief career.

Minnesota’s seasons can change quickly. It often seems that just when you get settled into a summer routine, summer ends. That was doubly true this year.


  COVID kept me closer to home this summer. My family and I got to know the parks, trails and waters near our house. And instead of our usual out-of-state summer trip, we opted for a Minnesota staycation this year. We spent time biking, fishing and walking dogs on Minnesota public lands and waters — and we weren’t alone.


  It seems the pandemic encouraged Minnesotans everywhere to get outside. We waived to neighbors on normally vacant trails, watched families exploring Minnesota parks, and swapped quick fishing reports with other anglers on the lake.


  I’d like to think so many of us turned to the outdoors because celebrating Minnesota’s natural beauty is an innate part of who we are. It’s where we instinctively go to recharge and revive ourselves. And if ever we needed a recharge, this summer certainly was it.


  As summer’s days grow shorter and cooler, it’s clear we’re not ready to head indoors — unless, of course, “indoors” is a tent or a camper cabin. Campgrounds are still buzzing with activity, fishing license sales are up, and trails continue to draw hikers, bikers and bird watchers.


  That’s probably because fall may be Minnesota’s best season, offering its own unique options for outdoor activities.


  With the summer crowds gone, fall fishing is hard to beat. In my house, fall is time to bring out the big gear and search for muskies. We enjoy fishing the quiet lakes and watching the loons prepare for their upcoming journey. Crisp fall nights also are wonderful for camping.


  This is the perfect time of year to stay in one of the many camper cabins the DNR has available at state parks throughout Minnesota — they’re warm on chilly nights, but still offer a great camping adventure. If a more rustic camping experience is your thing, our state forest campgrounds have first-come, first- serve sites. Download a geo-PDF map of the forest to your cell phone and you can roam to your heart’s content and never get lost.


  Of course, you might want to get a little lost in the splendor of fall color. Hiking, biking and bird watching amongst trees dressed in reds, golds and yellows is a great way to spend a fall day. If you’re looking for new places to watch the fall color show, the DNR’s webpage (mndnr.gov/fallcolor) has you covered with a Fall Color Finder Map, updates from each state park (including suggestions for things to do in addition to looking at leaves), fall color forest drives, and even a fall color email alert.


  And then there’s hunting. I’m always cautious about promising good hunting — I don’t want to jinx anyone, especially myself — but I’m encouraged with prospects for deer hunting in many parts of the state. The same goes for pheasants: Spring nesting conditions were good and August roadside counts were up.


  For most hunters, even the slightest positive sign is enough to get us planning our next outing in the woods and fields. If you’ve never been hunting, but have an inkling to try, I encourage you to get some training, perhaps find a mentor and give it a go this year. The DNR’s Learn to Hunt web page (mndnr.gov/gohunting) has how-to guides and even virtual hunting classes to get you started. The site can also connect you with hunting opportunities for youth, women and those with physical challenges.


  No matter how you choose to get outdoors as the summer slips into fall, I would encourage you to #BeGoodNATUREd. As more people connect with and enjoy the outdoors through hiking, ATV riding, hunting, camping, fishing and other outdoor activities, let’s celebrate the fact that we have more people loving Minnesota’s great outdoors and make room for everyone. Model good outdoors etiquette. Lend a hand. Leave no trace. Show that Minnesota’s public lands are open and welcoming to all — and all of us must care for them.


  The pandemic has changed many things for most of us. But what it hasn’t changed — in fact, what it has highlighted — is our love of the outdoors and our need to connect with nature.


  So let’s not mourn the passing of summer. Instead, let’s be thankful that in Minnesota we get to experience all four seasons and the outdoor opportunities each offers. Get out your flannel and your blaze orange, it’s time for fall ... and save a little time to plan for the exciting outdoor activities yet to come this winter!
