The most incredible part of Gregory Peck's iconic performance as attorney Atticus Finch in "To Kill a Mockingbird" isn't his unflappable dignity; it's how little he actually has to work with. Robert Mulligan's impressive adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel tells the story from the perspective of Finch's children, who are not privy to Finch's greatest doubts and fears as he defends a black man falsely accused of rape in Alabama in the 1930s. The nuances of Peck's performance emerge in brief flashes of emotional reflex, which he repeatedly stifles in order to do the right thing and be the best father possible. His performance looks like it's built on big moments and iconic speeches, but the foundation is in the fleeting moments of vulnerability.

The madness of war never had an avatar more exquisite than Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, who confuses pride for victory and nearly loses World War II in the process. A prisoner of war, he lets himself be tortured on a matter of principle -- a self-serving principle, one that excludes him and his officers from manual labor -- and is so impossibly stubborn he psychologically hobbles his captors. And then, just to prove his British greatness once and for all, he decides to build the finest bridge ever built -- for the enemy. Guinness understands the absolute self-righteousness necessary to justify Nicholson's monomania, and the absolute extremes that are necessary to wrestle him back into the real world.
