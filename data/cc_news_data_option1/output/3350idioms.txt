Jacksonville, Florida's Cold broke through to mainstream audiences with 2003's iconic _Year of the Spider_ , debuting at number 3 on the Billboard 200, with "Stupid Girl" cracking the Billboard Top 100. Frontman Scooter Ward's vocals always sounded full of pain and trauma, with "Gone Away (A Song for Starr)" a notable highlight. Ward's exhausted pangs cut deep as he reflects on his inability to see his daughter grow up because of life on the road.
 But when success came knocking, the band disappeared, releasing 2005's lackluster _A Different Kind of Pain_ before announcing a break-up. The group has since returned but is mostly slept-on by people who wrote the group off as a flash in the pan metal act. But the group remains as hard and cathartic as ever, with Ward sounding refreshed and recharged.

But at the end of the day, the best basketball is basketball when the ball moves and everybody's involved. And with the talent we're gonna have next year, especially early on and throughout the game, we're gonna be able to move the ball, play with the pass, obviously let those guys get to their sports. But when, at the end of the game we need a basket, we can get it to them. But having a guy like Caris show what he can do with the ball in his hands, obviously what Spencer can do with the ball in his hands, they're not going to have to be the guys that have to dominate the ball as much as they've done. Because of what Kyrie has done in the past and what KD did in OKC. KD has shown that he can play with the pass, obviously, in Golden State.

Others, like Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) have claimed that DeJoy's "main qualification for this job is that he is a large political donor for President Trump." While he has donated to Republicans, the assertion that his donations are his "main qualification" is clearly false. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board noted that "DeJoy built a trucking company from 10 employees in 1983 to almost 7,000 in 2014" and that after he sold the company to XPO Logistics he stayed on "as CEO of that company's North America supply-chain business." The Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board noted that DeJoy has sought to get the USPS's financial matters in order by emphasizing "the need to stick to schedules and cut overtime cost."

 Anderson had surgery the next day to fuse a fractured vertebrae in his neck, according to coach Jeff VanHee. There was damage to his spinal cord and the surgeon said there likely will be paralysis.

Hey Mike, I just want to highlight that Brazil has been shut down for the last three or four months and it just started opening up in the month of July. If you think about the state of Sao Paulo which is the big economic center, it's just started easing restriction, they just lowered kind of the rating over the last two weeks, kind of allowing for more and more people to go out and about, go to restaurants, schools still have not opened here yet. That's now projected to open in October. And so the fact that we're seeing this demand now as the economy slowly reopens, that's what gives us kind of hope that you're going to see a sequential improvement as we move forward.

I think there's going to be a steady improvement. We've already seen average fares come up very nicely over the last three to four weeks.

Illinois now has a constitutionally mandated flat-rate tax that taxes all personal income at the same rate of 4.95%.
 Under a graduated-rate income tax, different levels of wages are taxed at different rates. Proponents say higher income taxpayers should bear a greater tax burden than lower income taxpayers. Opponents say a graduated tax hurts business owners and job creators and makes them the target of future tax hikes. Raising taxes across the board under a flat tax is more difficult to do, they say.
 How does a graduated rate tax work?
 When a state imposes a graduated income tax, it separates the pay scale into a number of fixed income brackets and determines a different tax rate for each bracket, called a marginal rate.
 These brackets apply to every individual taxpayer’s income — the first bracket of your income will be taxed at the lowest rate, the second bracket at the second lowest rate, and so on. Ultimately, one’s average tax rate will be lower than their final marginal rate.
