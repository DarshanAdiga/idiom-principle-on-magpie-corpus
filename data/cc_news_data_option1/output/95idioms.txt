Those courts at Lucky Shoals look nothing like they did in Goodwin’s high school days. In September, the Atlanta Hawks opened the renovated courts which Atlanta’s NBA affiliate co-branded with State Farm as part of a years-long project to improve courts at Atlanta-area parks. Lucky Shoals’ courts were the 25th project completed by the Hawks since 2015, fulfilling the goal of 25 projects in five years. By the end of the total, the amount of renovated courts reached 27.
 The second full circle moment was happening in the Hawks’ corporate offices in downtown Atlanta for Amy Phuong, Vice President of Government Relations with the Atlanta Hawks. She, like Goodwin, had grown up playing basketball at Lucky Shoals Park. She attended Meadowcreek High School and after two years on the junior varsity team she realized her talents better suited her for serving her community. She went on the be the student body president at Georgia Tech and serve two Atlanta mayors, including experience in Atlanta’s Parks and Recreation Departments. For about one year, she’s been fostering relationships between the Atlanta Hawks and other municipal organizations, like Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation.
 “It was definitely a pleasant coincidence,” Phuong said regarding giving back to Lucky Shoals. “Prior to my time joining the Hawks, there were already conversations about what an expanded partnership would look like. This would be the first of its kind, and that was coincidentally already in the pipeline.”
 When the Hawks and State Farm opened the courts in September, the organizations also collaborated to renovate a new room in the recreation center. The room would ideally serve State Farm’s new Good Neighbor Club to host programming geared towards teens. Students could, for example, learn the etiquette of a job interview and engage in community service projects.
 On Tuesday, that room was packed with volunteers from State Farm, the Atlanta Hawks and some Gwinnett Parks staff. The teams decorated lunch bags for Gwinnett County students with motivational messages. Later on, those lunches were transported down the hall to be packed in backpacks that would be distributed to Gwinnett County students.
 That was the primary goal of Tuesday’s project: providing healthy snacks and school supplies to a densely-populated area of the county that sees some of the highest rates of homelessness and students on free and reduced lunch.

TULLAHOMA -- Exactly one month after a six-point loss at Lebanon's Campbell Brandon Gym/Hester Gibbs Court, Tullahoma turned the tables on the Devilettes this past Friday with a 69-52 victory.
 Lebanon's only leads were 14-13, 16-15 and 19-18 in the second quarter. Tullahoma widened a 26-23 edge early in the second half to 46-35 going into the fourth quarter as the Lady Wildcats climbed to 13-2 while the Devilettes dropped to 12-4.
 "They got a good basketball team," Lebanon coach Cory Barrett said of the Lady Wildcats. "They got a veteran basketball team. They hit shots. We did some uncharacteristic things, got in foul trouble early and threw us out of whack a little bit. But you got to give them all the credit in the world.

The physics of the climate system doesn’t care about political boundaries. Does Germany not matter because it’s responsible for (slightly) less than 2%, or does it matter because it’s part of the EU, responsible for 9.4% of emissions? How about if we divide China into 56 countries of 25 million people, each with emissions half of Australia’s – would that let them off the hook?
