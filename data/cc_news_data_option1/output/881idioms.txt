Sterling dipped against the U.S. dollar and euro on Wednesday, as an unexpected rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve fuelled expectations the Bank of England could follow suit to protect the economy from the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. The Feds emergency move on Tuesday to shield the worlds largest economy from the impact of the virus failed to comfort markets overnight, and the dollar regained ground against a basket of currencies.Consequently, sterling slipped back towards recent 4-12 month lows, down around 0.2 at 1.2792. The pound also fell against the euro and was last down around a third of a percent at 87.40 pence per euro as investors bet the Bank of England BoE could follow the Fed.Money markets have moved swiftly to fully price in a BoE rate cut of 25 basis points bps at its next meeting on March 26, up from a probability of 80 prior to the Fed move. Almost two cuts are priced in by the end of 2020, compared with none a few weeks ago.Certainly the market is priced for a 25 bps cut at the March meeting, so the market is anticipating the BoE will use up its arsenal, said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 currency strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. We have the services PMI data this morning and markets are mindful that next BoE chief Andrew Bailey is speaking this afternoon, so there are number of factors playing into the sterling weakness, he said.Bailey, who will take the helm later this month, is scheduled to speak to lawmakers in parliament later in the day. The February services Purchasing Mangers Index, an indicator of business activity, is due out later.Britain set out its battle plan to tackle the spread of the virus on Tuesday, warning that as many as a fifth of employees could be off work at the peak of the outbreak. BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday he expected a powerful and timely global response and said the central bank stood ready to act to support the economy.Whether or not the BoE follows the markets direction, particularly before the next meeting, remains unclear but the odds are clearly rising, analysts at RBC said in a note.

Volumul de povestiri se încheie cu un scurt interviu consemnat de editorul Bogdan Hrib şi intitluat „La o cafea cu Lucia Verona”, care dezvăluie multe. Întâi, despre profesia personajului principal: „De ce o cântăreaţă de operă? Nu mi-am dat seama decât mai târziu că era expresia unei frustrări – în copilărie şi adolescenţă era visul meu să devin o cântăreaţă celebră. Noroc că mi-am dat seama relativ repede că n-aş fi ajuns niciodată o Maria Callas şi mă refere la vocea şi talentul ei, nu la viaţa ei extramuzicală. Nu regret chiar deloc că am renunţat, dar uite că, fără voia mea, a apărut această divă care mai apoi a devenit Stella Marian-Harrington.”
 Scrisul Luciei Verona e relativ lesne recognoscibil. Este singura autoare de romane şi proze poliţiste de la noi care scrie într-o manieră foarte clasică, gen Agatha Christie, cu descrieri numeroase, dar de suprafaţă, introspecţii, analize, calm şi uşor umor, fără violenţe de limbaj. Deşi la tot pasul dai de o crimă, nimic nu îngrozeşte, totul pare banal sau firesc, o poveste, o invenţie la colţul sobei (sau şemineului) într-o seară lungă, să alunge pilctiseala. Atmosfera e englezească, chiar şi atunci când acţiunea se desfăşoară pe meleagurile noastre, iar pesonajele sunt neoaş dâmboviţene. Autoarea este atât de încântată - şi impregnată – de Agatha Christie, încât la un moment dat apare şi un alter ego lipsit de modestie al autoarei, care se cheamă chiar Agata Cristea.
 Apar în povestirile Luciei Verona o mulţime de personaje, cântăreţi de operă, impresari, scriitori, pictori, avocaţi, jurnalişti, multe amante. „Este adevărat însă că am şi personaje împrumutate din viaţa reală, în general la cererea lor, cum e cazul criticului Alex Ştefănescu sau al fostului deputat George Şerban (care m-a rugat ca, măcar în carte, să-l fac milionar; i-am îndeplinit dorin’a, doar nu mă costa nimic)” Între aceste personaje care oscilează între ficţiune şi realitate ar mai trebui amintit şi Stelian Munteanu, autot de romane poliţiste şi editor, de fapt eroul unor cărţi ale editorului Bogdan Hribm şi în fapt editorul însuşi.
 Cum nu se poate să povestim o tramă poliţistă, spre a nu dezamăgi cititorul, îi lăsăm acestuia plăcerea de a descoperi şi acţiunile, şi umorul, şi stilul.
 Lucia Verona – Vacanţele unei dive. Crime şi alte mistere investigate de Stella Marian-Harrington. Volumul 4 al seriei. Editura Tritonic, colecţia Mystery & thriller. 216 pag.

As the novel coronavirus \-- and panic about the coronavirus -- continues to spread around the world, so too are bogus claims, conspiracy theories and misinformation about the disease.
 There's so much inaccurate information floating around out there that the World Health Organization is calling it an "infodemic." In perhaps the clearest sign of the times, WHO has joined TikTok to help set the record straight.
 The myths exist both on the fringes of the internet and in more mainstream outlets. And while social media platforms are now taking steps to elevate credible information and remove content that could confuse people, they're fighting an uphill battle. Meanwhile, censorship and government mistrust in some countries have created a petri dish for misinformation to spread.

SEOUL -- South Korea reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as many sick people waited for hospital beds in Daegu, the city at the center of the worst outbreak outside China.
 The new cases bring South Korea's total to 5,621, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
 Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group.
 Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.
 "We need special measures in times of emergency," South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a cabinet meeting, referring to extra medical resources for hotspots and economic measures including a $9.8 billion stimulus.
 "In order to overcome COVID-19 as quickly as possible and minimize the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources."
 COVID-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus which emerged from China late last year to spread around the world.
 Hospitals in South Korea's hardest hit areas were scrambling to accommodate the surge in new patients.
 In Daegu, 2,300 people were waiting to be admitted to hospitals and temporary medical facilities, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said. A 100-bed military hospital that had been handling many of the most serious cases was due to have 200 additional beds available by Thursday, he added.
 South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday declared "war" on the virus, apologized for shortages of face masks and promised support for virus-hit small businesses in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.
 TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS
 Moon's office on Wednesday said he had canceled a planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March due to the crisis.
 At least 92 countries have imposed some form of entry restrictions on arrivals from South Korea, according to a tally by Yonhap news agency.
 Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young met the U.S. ambassador on Wednesday as part of Seoul's efforts to prevent the United States from imposing restrictions.
 In the meeting, Cho outlined South Korea's efforts to control the outbreak and urged the United States not to take steps that would affect exchanges between the two countries, the foreign ministry said.
 U.S. President Donald Trump said this week his administration was watching Italy, South Korea and Japan - all with severe outbreaks - and would make a decision about travel restrictions "at the right time."
 "We remain confident in the South Korean government's robust and comprehensive response efforts to limit the spread of the virus," U.S. ambassador Harry Harris tweeted after meeting Cho.
 Up to 10,000 people are being tested each day in South Korea, and daily totals have decreased slightly since a peak of 909 new cases on Saturday, the KCDC said.
 Experts caution that the results of those tests could take some time to be processed, leading to future spikes in confirmed cases. (Reporting by Josh Smith, Sangmi Cha, and Jack Kim; Writing by Josh Smith; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Stephen Coates and Andrew Cawthorne)

HERSHEY — After wrestling for six years, Ryan Aument traded his singlet and wrestling shoes for shorts and basketball sneakers.
 That lasted for two years — seventh and eighth grade.
 By then, the son of John and Jen Aument, who started wrestling in first grade, found that he missed the mat too much. The smell of the Resilite beat the screech on hardwood.
 Selinsgrove varsity coach Seth Martin was happy to have Aument back in the program, even though he knew little about him. He hadn’t tried to lure him to the wrestling room.
 “When I go through the hallways and I talk to kids about wrestling, the first question I ask is, ‘Do you play any sports in the winter?’ If they say ‘basketball,’ I say, ‘Never mind,’ because I am not here to take kids away from other sports,” Martin said.
 In Aument’s case, though, Martin knew he had wrestled and wanted to return.
 “I didn’t know what I had to work with,” Martin recalled. “Before that I had only heard of him in elementary because I knew some of the kids, but from elementary to varsity is a big difference — especially when you didn’t wrestle for two years.”
 Yet Aument was determined to return to the program. Why did he miss it so much?
 “I just like the work that goes with it,” said Aument, whose favorite sport is football. He was also the left fielder on last season’s Class 3A state championship baseball team.
 “You have to work hard, and I felt like wrestling would make me a better athlete and help me with football,” he said.
 It doesn’t hurt that some of his best friends are also wrestlers, Martin said.
 “He’s good buddies with Nate Schon (the Seals’ returning 220-pound state champion), even though they fight like siblings,” the coach said. “That was a big part of it, along with Coy (Bastian, a junior three-time state qualifier), and I was happy with it.”
 Aument agreed and attributed his progression in wrestling to the work he puts in with Schon, as well as Martin.
 “Having Nate Schon to work with, he has made me so much better through the years, and coach Martin is just the best coach I’ve ever had,” Aument said. “He makes us work hard and holds us accountable. He helped me get up to the next level that I needed to achieve my goal.”
 Reversal of fortune
 The goal was met last week when Aument finally got over the hump and qualified for the PIAA 3A tournament for the first time.
 It didn’t come without anxious moments.
 Aument was leading Bellefonte’s Tyler Benner 6-1 with 30 seconds left in the Northwest Regional semifinals in Altoona where a win would punch his ticket to Hershey.
 In the blink of an eye, it all fell apart. Benner caught Aument and pinned him in 5:43.
 “He had an absolutely devastating loss in the semifinals,” Martin said. “For me, as a coach in my 10 years, I don’t think I have sat in the corner and seen anything like that happen. That’s a huge hit to your mental game.’’
 Martin confided in Aument after the tournament that he didn’t know if Aument would be able to mentally bounce back in time before he had to wrestle a do- or-die consolation match.
