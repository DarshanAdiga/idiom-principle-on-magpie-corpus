Malaysia will restrict movements in its biggest city, Kuala Lumpur, neighboring Selangor state and the administrative capital of Putrajaya starting Wednesday to curb a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob says all schools in these areas will be shut and all religious, sports and social activities will be halted for two weeks. He says economic activities can continue but with strict health measures. The move comes just over four months after Malaysia lifted a three-month nationwide lockdown to control the pandemic. It has experienced a new wave of cases following increased travel for an election last month in eastern Sabah state, a hotspot on Borneo island. Several politicians, including a Cabinet minister, tested positive for the virus after returning from Sabah. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had to isolate himself for two weeks after coming into contact with the minister. The government earlier announced that Sabah will be placed under a restricted movement order from Tuesday. Ismail said inter- district travel is banned under the partial lockdown, except with approval. Other restrictions include a limit of two people leaving each household to purchase groceries. Malaysia has reported more than 16,000 cases with 157 deaths.

Prior to the approval, Shaffer said it hasn’t been an easy project to try to find somebody that was interested in it.
 “This is a building that was built in 1916,” said Shaffer. “It has sliding doors with external piping that allows those doors to stack, and that piping has rotted off through the years. We’ve had a variety of welders and construction people try to look at it, figure out how we could fix it. It’s one of those homemade things, but the guy that did it, back when he did it, knew exactly what he was doing. And back to 1916, he had lots of time, and today to try to fix it, it just doesn’t seem that there’s any economical way, is the key. You can do anything, but the economical way to do it just doesn’t seem to be there.”
 Shaffer said he tried to locate contractors interested in removing it.
 “And I did that through going through a variety of scrap yards, and talking to the scrap yards and seeing who’s out there. And really, didn’t get any response until I found, especially looking at the internet, looking at the yellow pages, and found a contractor up in the Weedville area, Mr. Paul Blake, that was interested, and he actually came and looked at it and gave me two proposals,” said Shaffer. “One proposal is to remove the building in its entirety. And then the second is just to remove the outer skin and see if we had any interest in re-skinning that building and putting doors on it and try to make rentals out of it.
 “The price to remove the outer shell and leave the superstructure $8,500 plus the value of the skin,” said Shaffer. “To remove the entire building superstructure and skin, and retain the scrap for its value, the contractor was looking at $6,750. So, it’s a 25 percent out of pocket to the authority. Initially, we’ll have to pay the entire amount, and recover 75 percent from our equipment grant of $10,000. So, we’re looking at an out-of-pocket expense at about $1,700 or $1,800.”
 The executive committee talked about this and all agreed that they should proceed with tearing it down completely.

 # Titans' COVID-19 outbreak: Bills game on track after clean tests Monday
 Erik Bacharach
 Nashville Tennessean
 View Comments
 NASHVILLE — The Titans have moved one step closer to playing their Tuesday game against the Buffalo Bills as scheduled.
 Tennessee on Monday morning returned no positive COVID-19 test results, a league source confirmed to The Tennessean. The source requested anonymity because no official announcement has been made.
 Clean test results Tuesday morning would pave the way for Tuesday's 6 p.m. kickoff at Nissan Stadium.
 The Titans, dealing with the league's first teamwide coronavirus outbreak, returned to their team facility Saturday for the first time since it was forced to close on Sept. 29. Despite one more staff member returning a positive COVID-19 test Sunday morning, the Titans announced they practiced later Sunday afternoon.
 “Early this afternoon, the NFL gave the team permission to hold a practice with limited staff – players, coaches and a handful of support staff," the team said in a statement. "The hour and 45 minute practice took place outdoors.”
 The Titans have had 24 team members – 13 players and 11 personnel – test positive for the coronavirus since Sept. 24.
 Titans coach Mike Vrabel on Saturday said he would not be commenting on potential COVID-19 violations by the team until an NFL and NFLPA investigation was complete.

Synonymous with the summer months, Şile bezi is an airy and lightweight hand- loomed cotton fabric that is manufactured into summer dresses, casual tops for men and women, tablecloths and bed linens and is reminiscent of linen. Revered for being a non-synthetic, crimpled cotton muslin that absorbs moisture, the fabric, for the most part, is not dyed but instead embellished with symbolic embroidery or crochet. Named after Şile, the seaside region north of Istanbul proper, the fabric has traditionally been produced by local rural women who wash the fabric in the Black Sea and lay it to dry out on the beach itself. This natural fabric and the textiles produced from it are regularly available at local bazaars all over the country, as well as at the Şile Yeryüzü Pazarı, held Fridays and Sundays, and specializing in locally produced food products and textiles.

 Rather than removing her base completely, Joy saved the look by applying a Morphe red-toned bronzer. First of all she used it as a blush to bring that warmth back to her cheeks, before sweeping it across her temples.

"As much as we make progress, this pandemic just shows that we still have a long way to go for our community to ensure that people feel safe being their true, genuine selves, in all spaces. Ideally we get to a place where we don't need these spaces because LGBTQ+ people are welcome in all spaces.

During the couple's interview with _OK!_ magazine, Tom and Kelsey confirmed that heartbreakingly, the tumour was discovered to be a grade four glioblastoma - and "the worst case scenario". The report adds that life expectancy for such an illness typically ranges from 3 to 18 months, with the median length of time being a year.
 Speaking about how they've been coping since the diagnosis, Tom told the publication, "I think Kelsey has come to terms with it better than me. It's so consuming. It's so hard and it's all I can think about."
 Kelsey added, "It still doesn't feel real. I don't think Tom will ever process this information. It's horrendous. Watching your partner go through this is so hard, because how can I tell him to not let it consume him? I take his phone away from him, because otherwise he will sit there and Google things and then end up in a hole. The more you Google, the worse possible stuff it throws at you, and that's not good for anyone." He is currently undergoing life- prolonging treatment in London.

Winning an NBA championship is nothing new for the Los Angeles Lakers. They have been in the finals a record 31 times since winning the title on their first trip in 1950, and they tied the Boston Celtics with 17 championships after seeing off the Miami Heat on Sunday night. But those are just statistics for superfans to rattle off over steaming pizza or a trivia question on a soggy napkin in a sports bar. Championship playoffs are much more than naked numbers – each has its own unique personality, its own significance to the players and fans, and its own impact on American culture. The game is never “just a game”. For those who think sports are merely mindless entertainment somehow separate from the _Sturm und Drang_ of the world around, you haven’t been paying attention lately. Sports have always been a mirror of national values reflecting all the same struggles and turmoil. This year’s championship series is especially meaningful because, although it took place during one of the most politically and socially chaotic and world-bending times in recent history, in many ways, it was an expression of the finest qualities of America – both on and off the court.

 "They supported the team from the first minute to the last and they were there for the less glamorous cup games during some difficult times and when we were away from home.
 "Newcastle supporters are, without doubt, an example for others to follow - but I did have a hard time understanding Geordie. It's very complicated!"
 Luque made his debut just two days after joining from Deportivo and to put that whirlwind move into perspective, the new signing even had a translator on the bench.
 While he had to get to grips with a new language, a new culture and a new style of football, Luque soon felt 'very comfortable' living in Jesmond.
 However, in just his second game for Newcastle, the Spaniard tore a hamstring and struggled to ever regain the form that saw the Magpies stump up such a sizeable sum.
 "The truth is that it was a huge blow because it was the most serious injury of my career," he said.

While 18 out of 30 wells around the Allouk water station are working actively, 12 of them do not because they are defective. The water extracted from the wells is treated in the Allouk water station and then sent to the regime's region with 12 pumps. Since three of these pumps are out of order, only nine pumps are in operation. Syrian engineers, who came to the region following talks between Turkey and Russia, have been trying to do the repair and maintenance of pumps.

County officials said the lowest bid for another five-year contract was $12.4 million higher than the current contract pending expiration.
 Bearing in mind the state has a mandated 2 percent property tax cap, the above increase would translate to a 5.1 percent increase in county property taxes, in order to balance that budget line.
 To retain the service as-is, and remain under the tax cap, would require heavily drawing on the county’s general fund, which legislators said is not sustainable — especially during the current budget climate with falling revenue.
 Instead, the legislature is considering repealing the law in order to completely remove the recycling tax line from residents’ property tax bills and allow individuals to contract for those services as they see fit.
 If residents do not wish to contract with a company for curb-side pickup, recyclables could still be taken to a transfer station. Legislators noted that companies may charge a fee for drop-off, as well.
 Legislators noted that if a given municipality collects garbage, they would provide recycling collection also.
 Legislative Chairwoman Marte Sauerbrey noted that Tioga County is currently experiencing a 20 percent cut in funding from New York State and is anticipated to continue through 2021.
 “We also have a 9 percent reduction in sales tax to date,” she said. “Income from Tioga Downs is non-existent at this time.”
 “The legislature is working on our budget for 2021, and we have estimated that it will take three to five years to recover from the Covid-19 experience and the states’ financials difficulties,” Sauerbrey explained. “It is unfortunate, but we have to tighten our belts and do more with less for the next few years.”

“We had a doctor with us and the best of care and weren’t in contact with anyone. It was just unfortunate the timing of it. When we came home we all did our two weeks the same as anyone else who had international travel. Lads just got on with it. I think it was just one of those things.”
 Maher agrees the fact Tipperary are defending an All-Ireland title from November 1 when they face Clare or Limerick in a Munster semi-final doesn’t feel as significant because of the time that has passed because of the pandemic.
 “It’s over 12 months ago now. There’s a new focus for everyone. It felt like a fresh start coming in and coming back training again. Because we had been apart for so long, it was almost as if everyone felt ‘come on, let’s have a go at this. Let’s start to climb the mountain again.’ I would say it helped, I haven’t thought about it much but it is nearly a distant memory at this stage.”
 There was heartbreak for Maher in late August when his penalty for Borris- Ileigh was saved by Drom and Inch goalkeeper Eoin Collins in the quarter-final shootout. But he is philosophical about the experience.
 “It was unfortunate I suppose the way it finished. When you're not beaten in open play, and you lose in the way that we did, it's hard to take. But look again, things had to be a different way this year, and that's the way we knew it was going to penalties if it was a draw after extra-time.
 “Look, credit to Drom - they took their penalties well, we took ours poorly. And it's as simple as that.
 “I'm not going to say 'there shouldn't have been penalties'. We knew what the scenario was going to be. It's the same for both teams. I don't dwell on these things too much, to be honest.
 “I try to play in the moment, play in the game as it is, give everything I can. Once it's done, it's done. The result, you can't change it now.”
 The 31-year-old doesn’t fully believe Tipperary are at a disadvantage when they face a Clare or Limerick team with a game under their belt.
