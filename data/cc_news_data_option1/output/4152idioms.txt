Julio Jones, Chris Godwin, DeSean Jackson, Alshon Jeffery, DJ Chark, and Diontae Johnson have all missed time this season. Among the crew, only Johnson hasn't missed a full contest so far. That has left the wide receiver position banged up and lacking depth at times, but hopefully, fantasy owners will soon see the light at the end of the tunnel for these injuries. With Week 6 of the NFL season approaching and four teams on bye, these players are having a major impact on potential start 'em, sit 'em decisions and are certainly impacting our Week 6 fantasy WR rankings. Here's the latest on these key injuries as we near the midpoint of the fantasy regular season.

French rugby chiefs on Thursday reached a compromise which will allow the national side to play all six games of the extended autumn Test window, but capped at three the matches a player can appear in, sources said.
 The French rugby league (LNR), which runs the lucrative Top 14 and second division ProD2, has been at loggerheads with the French rugby federation (FFR) over the World Rugby-sanctioned increase in Tests following the coronavirus shutdown.
 France will host Wales in a warm-up on October 24 before finishing off their Six Nations campaign at home to Ireland a week later and then play four games in the newly-created Autumn Nations Cup from November 14-December 5.
 The LNR had insisted the number of games be capped at five and even launched an appeal -- which was rejected -- in France's highest administrative court.
 In the compromise, announced Thursday after negotiations between the two warring parties, the bodies also agreed to cap France match-day squads at 31.
 France coach Fabien Galthie intially wanted 42-strong squads.
 The France squad to face Wales in the opening game is expected at Les Bleus' training camp in Marcoussis, south of Paris, from Monday.
 Galthie named five uncapped players in his squad to play Wayne Pivac's Welsh team.
 Prop Georges-Henri Colombe Reazel and centre Olivier Klemenczak have been rewarded for their performances as Racing 92 reached the European Champions Cup final.

Spots four through seven are occupied by Japanese sedans: the 1997 Honda Accord (30,754 thefts), the 2007 Toyota Camry (15,656), the 2015 Nissan Altima (13,355), and the 2018 Toyota Corolla (12,137). It's a group that illustrates the list's diversity. On one hand, thieves are still attracted to a 23-year- old Honda, and there are enough left on American roads for it to unenviably earn a spot on this list. On the other hand, a 2-year-old Toyota is evidently not difficult to steal even though it's a modern (albeit basic) car.

Frankie Dettori says he has "done quite well" in a "surreal season" that has deprived him of the big racecourse crowds he relishes.
 The Italian-born superstar jockey is being rather modest, having partnered his "favourite girl" Enable to a historic third King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes win and Stradivarius to a third successive Ascot Gold Cup triumph.
 Stradivarius, whose victory at Royal Ascot helped Dettori to finish as top jockey at the meeting, will be one of the showman's principal rides in British flat racing's showpiece Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday.
 Each Dettori win will be accompanied by his shaping his hands into a heart, firing imaginary arrows at the cameras and the famous flying dismount.
 "I thought honestly without crowds I might not perform as good as with them there," the 49-year-old told AFP. "Funnily enough it has been the former and I have done quite well.
 "However, regardless of that, I am someone who does need a crowd and they do lift you."
 Dettori says once the jockeys are led into the starting stalls, he banishes from his mind any regrets about the lack of atmosphere on the racecourses due to coronavirus restrictions.
 "The game we are in is high-adrenalin and a risky job," he said. "Second nature takes over without a crowd.
 "Once the stalls open you are going at 40 miles an hour flat out and we are within an inch of each other so you cannot get complacent."
 Dettori says he is sad that superstar mare Enable and Stradivarius -- both trained by the man he terms "the master trainer", John Gosden -- have not had the packed stands they deserved.
 "It has been a great year with those two but so surreal with no one there. You know, I would have loved to have 80,000 at the Gold Cup when 'Strad' won."
 He points out that Enable's final race of a stellar career at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe this month took place in front of just 1,000 spectators -- she finished sixth in her bid for a record third win.
 "They all clapped but it is not the same atmosphere," said Dettori.
 "However, at least we are still doing it -- at least lockdown does not affect us, and racing has been very good following the rules."
 \- Enable 'tears' -
 Dettori admitted to shedding a few tears "of joy at happy memories" when Enable retired this week ahead of a breeding career and he duly went round and fed her "a packet of Polo mints".
 Now though he is determined her fellow six-year-old Stradivarius, who was seventh in the Arc, will end the season on a high in the British Champions Long Distance Cup.
 "I had his owner (Bjorn Nielsen) on the phone and he said 'now your favourite horse has gone you'd better make mine the favourite horse' and I said 'of course'.
 "I love the little boy. I have been involved in racing for around 35 years more or less and it is unique to have a stayer with the turn of foot (speed). He is unique."
 Dettori jokes that his role in the extraordinary partnership he has formed with Gosden is "at least I steer them in the right direction".
 Aside from Stradivarius, he also has some other highly fancied rides for Gosden on Saturday.
 He will be riding Palace Pier in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and French Derby winner Mishriff in the Champion Stakes.
 Dettori says "it sucks" he cannot go to watch his beloved Arsenal in the close season.
 "Now they are good and when they were bad I could see them", said the Italian, who turns 50 in December.
 However, retirement is not a word that passes his lips.
 "Blimey really? Fifty... I forgot about that," he said laughing.
 "I have to carry on for at least three years for the Kingman-Enable yearling that will be so fast no one will be able to catch them."

 She said: "I decided aged nine to be a teacher. It was not a grandiose idea of changing the world, it was because my PE teacher had a sports car and I loved it. She was dead kind and gave me my first chocolate orange.
 "The kindness of a trendy teacher with a nice car and a nice home who took an interest in me made me think I'd like to be like her."
 As a teenager, Gloria excelled at athletics, appearing on the front page of the ECHO in 1978 after becoming Merseyside sprinting champion.

A long-awaited HBO-BBC TV series depicting the toxic culture of a fictional international finance firm's UK graduate programme premiered at the London Film Festival this week ahead of its November release.
 "Industry" starkly portrays pervasive issues of race, class and gender poisoning the bank's scheme in the British capital as ambitious twenty- somethings compete for permanent jobs.
 Several episodes in the much-anticipated series were shown virtually from Sunday to Wednesday at the 12-day film festival, which is taking place largely online because of coronavirus restrictions.
 The first instalment, directed by Hollywood star Lena Dunham, is set to hit the small screen in the United States on November 9, and in Britain and some European countries the next day.
 It dives straight into an ugly portrayal of the contentious world of global finance and its cut-throat graduate schemes, with snobbery, racism and sexism all on show.
 In one scene in the women's toilets, a seemingly privileged white graduate unflinchingly tells another that a black participant's "narrative" is impossible to compete with.
 "Everything's aligned for her," she complains. "I know she went to a shit uni, and I know she's black," adding that meant "tick, tick" in the eyes of politically correct recruiters.
 The black character, Harper, played by rising star Myha'la Herrold, overhears the disparaging conversation. She is also sexually assaulted in a taxi by a high-powered female investor client with whom she has just attended a company dinner.
 Meanwhile another ethnic minority graduate who has confessed to being made to feel inadequate by fellow participants because of his humble background, commits suicide after printing a page in the wrong font in a lengthy report.
 \- 'Behind closed doors' -
 "Industry" is the brainchild of Wales-based production company Bad Wolf and its co-founding executive producer Jane Tranter, who was behind previous HBO hits "The Night Of" and "Succession" as well as several popular BBC series.
 A former head of the British broadcaster's revenue-generating BBC Worldwide arm in the US, she first conceived of the project after reading some years ago about the death of an intern working for an American bank in London.
 "It just made you start to think about what goes on behind closed doors and how can it be?" Tranter told a London Film Festival panel discussion this week.
 Bad Wolf commissioned two rookie screenwriters, Konrad Kay and Mickey Down -- who had both worked for international banks in London -- to pen the eight-part drama.
 "They were fresh out of it, they still had the scent of that life on them," Tranter said, adding: "This great howl of truth kind of came out".
 The next steps in the years-long gestation of the series saw HBO get on board, offering up "Girls" creator and actress Dunham to direct the pilot episode.
 Tranter recalled her arriving at their Welsh filming studios with an aura of celebrity about her and being a "bubble of joy the whole time".
 The executive producer noted those in the series likely to win audiences' allegiances were not "the characters that you normally see winning, and certainly not winning in a bank, on screen".
 "You don't really see the message that you've written, if you like, until you pull back and look at it all," Tranter said.
 "In 'Industry', when you pull back and look at where all the bad ones are, they are all without exception white men. And definitely men."
