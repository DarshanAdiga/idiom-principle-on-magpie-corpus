Those in the Manitou Beach area may have noticed last week the former Jerry's Pavilion Market building coming down.
   
 While recent "transplants" may have known it only as a grocery store owned by Jerry's, or back to the Tibbs family, hundreds of others knew when the facility was the Devils Lake Pavilion.
   
 In recent years, the store undeniably had some structural issues, and I am told those issues prompted the new owners to move forward with demolition.
   
 And that's OK. Not everything lasts forever.
   
 Othel E. Green knew that firsthand.
   
 Many of the area's seasoned residents remember Green running the original open-air dance hall in the 1950s and early 1960s. After the building burned to the ground early Labor Day morning 1963 due to faulty stage wiring, Green vowed to rebuild bigger and better. The remains of the north-south building were cleared and by April 1964, Green had a new, teal and blue east-west dance hall constructed. The front of the building simply said in large letters, "PAVILION." Constructed of modern materials including steel trusses, glass doors and concrete blocks, the new dance hall was less likely to catch fire, and it could house more patrons.
   
 On the night of April 11, 1965, just about one year after it opened, one night after a pre-season crowd numbered near 2,000, the new hall was flattened by the Palm Sunday tornado. Green could have called it a day, cashed in his losses and retired, losing two buildings in two years, but he knew the value of giving area teens a place to hang out and enjoy music.
   
 Over the summer of 1965, he cleared the old heap that was the building and rebuilt a similar building on its footprint.
   
 Green died in April 1970 and his son took over, but the days of the dance hall were quickly fading.
   
 By 1973, the hall's days as a destination were over, and the Tibbs family bought the property to convert into Tibbs Brothers IGA. The old "Pavilion" lettering from Green's ownership days remained well into the 2000s, with the IGA logo placed before it. Eventually, the Jerry's Market owners from Tecumseh bought the building and in 2013 rebranded the store. After six years, the store closed, unable to sustain itself, and over the past year, has sat silent, awaiting its fate.
   
 And so, now in July 2020, the building is coming down piece by piece, nostalgia waxing and sadness abounding for the memories no longer connected to a physical structure. Let the music play on in our memories, as well as the store, where we walked the creaking wooden floor upon which Bob Seger, The Yardbirds and many others once trod.

In addition to app control, many affordable robot vacuums these days support Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant for added convenience, including the RoboGeek 23T and the Roomba 675. If you also own a compatible smart speaker like the Amazon Echo or Google Nest Mini, you'll be able to control these vacuums using your voice.
 Meanwhile, if you have carpeting and/or a large home, you might want to opt for a model with smart navigation abilities. Vacuums with this capability, such as the iLife A9, clean in a methodical path, making straight lines instead of zigzagging in a random pattern. This allows them to clean your home more efficiently, and will result in neat vacuum lines on your carpets.
 In this price range, you can't expect every feature under the sun, so you might have to make some trade-offs. When I bought my first robot vacuum, I prioritized strong suction power and smart navigation over Wi-Fi support and a compact design. But you might want a model that you can remotely control with your phone, or a smaller one that can pass under your couches and push out pet toys.
 ## When Is the Best Time to Buy a Robot Vacuum?
 The biggest tip I can offer anyone buying a robot vacuum on a budget is to wait for a sale, and search around because they are frequently marked down at Amazon and Walmart in particular. In our reviews, we note the MSRP of each model, but you can often find them for less at various points throughout the year.
 Finally, our individual reviews go over all the specs and features of each model, so be sure to check them out. When you find the one that fits your needs and budget, head over to our seven essential robot vacuum tips. And if you're looking for a robot mop, we've got you covered.

What’s really galling is that there is such a simple solution: All that the Trump re-election campaign organizations would have to do is distribute MAGA masks and the problem would be solved. Apparently there’s a fear that Trump haters would use the masks to clean off other parts of their bodies, if you catch my drift.
 Trump has attached himself to a new issue to demagogue. He and Education Secretary Betsy Devos are pressuring local officials around the country to reopen schools. He clearly views it as a chance to appeal to parents who would like their little tykes out of the house. The problem is that the kiddies could get ill with this highly contagious “invisible killer” and, in worst case scenarios, they could bring the virus home or even die.
 Donald Trump is desperate to be re-elected. Desperate enough to do and say foolish things. Come to think of it, that’s not really anything different.

“The healthcare system is poorly funded on paper, but these funds are not even allocated in reality. Healthcare expenses in the general fund of the state budget are underfunded by one third, and the gap is deepening every month. It looks like a goal has been set, despite the pandemic, to force healthcare workers to resign and leave abroad,” the MP said.

The problem is that young people are love-starved, or whatever term you would like to substitute. As soon as the bars, beaches and swimming pools were allowed to reopen, they swooped in — 20-somethings, 30-somethings, 40- and 50-somethings, even the teeny-boppers with phony IDs — hitting on everybody in sight. Tossing caution to the wind, along with their face masks, they crammed together in tight spaces. In effect, COVID became an STD, a socially transmitted disease.
 And that’s why we’re seeing so many positive results, when these party animals even bother being tested. After they leave their hot spots and return to their families and friends, they create new hot spots in their communities. Each has the potential to become a one-person pestilence.
 Deborah Birx, the White House overseer of all thing coronavirus — almost as famous as Tony Fauci — said the kiddies and kiddie wannabes had been docilely complying with the stay at home orders, except for the militia groups. But when first word came of a relaxing of restrictions, some of them went berserk. Or as Birx more elegantly put it, “When they saw people out and about on social media, they all went out and about.”

OTTAWA COUNTY -- In an effort to provide more voting options during the coronavirus pandemic, officials in Michigan sent absentee ballot applications to voters across the state.
   
 In Ottawa County, that decision has led to a boost in returned absentee ballots during the election cycle for the Michigan statewide primary on Tuesday, Aug. 4.
   
 Ottawa County elections coordinator Steven Daitch said as of Monday, July 20, 55,565 absentee ballots have been issued to registered voters in the county. As of Friday, July 17, 16,273 ballots had been returned to the county. Over 3,000 absentee ballots were issued between Friday and Monday alone, per the county elections office.
   
 Daitch expects the majority of absentee ballots to be returned by Election Day. To be counted, absentee ballots have to be returned to a local clerk's office before 8 p.m. on Election Day.
   
 "I would expect a large number (of ballots) to come back," he said. "Definitely the vast majority. Probably in the 80 to 90 percent range."
   
 For comparison, in the August 2016 statewide primary (2016 was the last presidential election cycle), 16,152 absentee ballots were issued in Ottawa County, 14,381, or 89 percent, of which were returned.
   
 Daitch believes local clerks in Ottawa County will be able to count all the absentee ballots on time for the August election, due to increased staffing and newly purchased counting equipment. The November general election may pose problems, however, as voter turnout, both absentee and in person, is likely to increase with the presidential election on the ballot.
   
 In Michigan, election law mandates that election workers can only count absentee ballots on Election Day itself.
   
 "I think for August we'll be OK. The real question is going to come in November," Daitch said. "Because if we're seeing 80, 90 percent of the ballots cast in an election are absentee -- for August that's OK. In November, it will just take more time.
   
 "But I think we've purchased enough equipment, and we have enough people where I am expecting things to be pretty smooth for August."
   
 According to the Michigan Secretary of State's Office, as of July 14, over 1.7 million absentee ballots were issued across the state for the August primary. For comparison, in 2016, just over 475,000 absentee ballots were issued during the August voting cycle.
   
 Still, Daitch said voters in Ottawa County who wish to vote in person will be able to. Local precincts will be open across the county, and COVID-19 safety measures will be in place to keep workers and voters safe.

Next, RememBear creates what it calls a Backup Kit, which enables you to recover your account even if you forget your master password or lose all your trusted devices. The document includes a 29-digit New Device Key (NDK) for your desktop devices and a QR code for your mobile devices. There's also a spot to write down your master password. This is a potent document, so keep it somewhere safe—perhaps a fireproof lockbox. 1Password offers a similar setup step.
 RememBear does not currently support two-factor authentication methods for securing access to your account. This is a serious omission. RememBear _does_ require you to enter the NDK when you are setting up a new device, but that key is not required for every login attempt. It’s a fine way to secure the process of adding devices, but, again, we much prefer those services that integrate true two-factor methods.
 For instance, both Dashlane and Keeper support time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps and U2F-compatible security keys for authentication. RememBear does include a TOTP field for each password entry, though, meaning that you can use RememBear to manage the two-factor authentication codes for all your other accounts, rather than Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.
 On the topic of security, in 2017, RememBear underwent an audit by Cure53 (this link opens a PDF). We'd like to see more password managers follow suit and commit to regular security audits. You can read about RememBear's security policies here.
