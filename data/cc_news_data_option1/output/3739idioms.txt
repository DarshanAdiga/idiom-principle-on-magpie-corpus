We should mention that while this trial was going on, Scott was already behind bars, serving a 28-year sentence after he pleaded guilty in 2013 to the felony charges related to the two arsons he committed. These included attempted aggravated murder, aggravated arson, insurance fraud, disrupting public services, and child endangerment. Therefore, to this date, Scott Purk, at the age of 58, is in prison, at the Pickaway Correctional Institution, where he will stay till at least 2057, because that is when he will be eligible for parole. Scott was charged and hence convicted, with only Margaret's slaying, and not of their unborn child's, as, in 1985, when their death's transpired, they would not have been considered separate crimes.

Joining the Gateway Foundation Board of Directors as a Polk County resident and representative, Sarah Grymes is a proponent for affordable housing in her region. Grymes brings a vast knowledge of the lack of affordable housing through her professional experience as the Executive Director with Housing Assistance Corporation Inc. headquartered in Hendersonville. Grymes has a passion to give back to her community and has served on numerous boards. She currently serves on the North Carolina Housing Coalition Policy Committee and Advent Health Foundation Board.

She is required to serve a minimum of 30% of her sentence before being eligible for parole, meaning 9 years. And, as she got credit for all the time she already served in the local jail pending her trial, it reduced her potential prison time to around 7 years. She could be eligible for release sooner, with good behavior, but recent records show that she has a discipline problem in jail, meaning that that might not be in the cards for her. In other words, at the age of 49, Sherra Wright-Robinson is still behind bars, at the Tennessee Prison for Women, where she will stay till at least 2026.

As Sherra was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, she faced the possibility of life in prison if she went to trial and was convicted. Therefore, in 2019, she handed in a plea deal, negotiated between her defense team and the prosecutors, where she pleaded guilty to facilitation to commit first-degree murder and facilitation to commit attempted first-degree murder. This deal was unexpected, but it was accommodated, especially as Lorenzen's family didn't have a problem with it. And, in the end, after the hearing, Sherra Wright-Robinson was convicted of her guilty plea charges and sentenced to 30 years behind bars.

Deputy Ryan Hendrix was described in many ways during his funeral Friday, but the one word repeated most often was "hero."
   
 The fallen officer is a father, son, brother, fiancee, Christian and example of those in law enforcement, according to those closest to him who spoke at his service.
   
 Well over 1,500 people watched the livestreamed service on Facebook alone, in addition to those who tuned in through YouTube or filled the sanctuary at Mud Creek Baptist Church.
   
 The Rev. Steve Scoggins said people overflowed from the pews and stood along the walls. He described the scene as heartfelt support for Hendrix and law enforcement.
   
 Hendrix was the type of employee supervisors dream about, Henderson County Sheriff Lowell Griffin said. He had a tremendous and contagious attitude, always smiling and up to something, and it never seemed like he had a bad day.
   
 He treated others with dignity, no matter the situation, Griffin said. Hendrix had the ability to de-escalate situations and always let his fellow officers know he had their back. Hendrix left an impression on all who spent time with him.
   
 "He never missed an opportunity to face a challenge. You couldn't tell him that he couldn't climb a mountain because it was too high, or swim a river because it was too wide," Griffin said, because Hendrix would prove you wrong.
   
 He was not about exceeding or meeting standards, but setting them.
   
 "If you gave him a mission, you didn't have to worry about it being taken care of; it was going to be completed and completed right," the sheriff said.
   
 Griffin paused for a moment before offering his final words of remembrance at the ceremony.
   
 "God speed, deputy Ryan Hendrix. Your work here is done, and with the help of everyone here today, we will hold the line until we meet again," Griffin said.
   
 Hendrix's father, siblings and fiancee also offered personal tributes. They often referred to Ryan's Christian faith, and the belief that they will be reunited again with him one day.
   
 Hendrix's only sister, Abigail, remembered a big brother whose talents always exceeded expectations. Whether it was a board game or sport, her big brother was always the best.
   
 "In my entire life, I have never met anyone as talented as Ryan, but honestly, all of his talents do not compare to Ryan's servant's heart," she said. "That's what amazes me the most about him."
   
 She recalled moments of competition from their childhood, including a story about when Ryan beat her in a sewing competition at the state fair.
   
 "Ryan, you have won at life's competition," his sister said. "Yes, life on earth has been cut far too short; however, you have accomplished more in your 34 years than the rest of us can hope for in 100."
   
 Hendrix left a "very long list of accomplishments" for his siblings to live up to.
   
 "Thank you, Ryan, for being you, because you are a saint and you are my hero. I love you," she said.
   
 Hendrix's oldest brother, Jamin, described a man with many sides, from serving his country as a Marine, including a tour in Iraq, to a man who loved hot dogs and Kraft macaroni and cheese.
   
 He spoke to his niece and nephew, Elloree and Merritt, letting it be known their six uncles and one aunt will be there to go on all of the adventures they would have gone on with their dad.
   
 Elloree and Merritt encompass the perfect mix of goofiness and bravery, just like their father, he added.
   
 Jamin Hendrix also offered words of gratitude to his brother's fiancee, Emily Wilkins.
   
 "God brought you to Ryan so he could die a happy man," he said.
   
 One of Hendrix's younger brothers, Thomas, also described a guy full of life and happiness.
   
 "He was the dad every kid wishes they could have," he said, adding there was no greater joy for his brother than when he became a parent.
   
 "…This last year I have seen a man who was happier than I have ever seen anyone. He had kids he loved, a fiancee that brought him nothing but joy, and a job he never stopped talking about…"
   
 Hendrix's family expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support. The Sheriff's Office staff has done "all that is humanly possible" to help the family climb out of the "deepest and darkest pit," said Don Hendrix, Ryan's father.
   
 Don Hendrix gave credit to his wife, Heidi Hendrix, for nurturing and raising their eight children into the people they've become.
   
 Ryan's father also took a moment to address his son's fiancee, whom he was supposed to marry in October.
   
 "Emily, you reset the joy button in Ryan's life," Don Hendrix said.
   
 He then spoke to his grandchildren. "Grandma and grandpa, your aunts and uncles promise to help you always remember the amazing father you have," Don Hendrix said. "…As you grow older and you want to know more about your father… we will be there to tell you the stories. God bless you guys."
   
 Finally, Don Hendrix spoke directly to his son.
   
 "Ryan Phillip Hendrix, thank you. The life you lived to the fullest showed us your strength of character, your call to duty, your dedication to fatherhood…" he said. "…It has been my pleasure, and it is now my honor to be your dad. Rest in peace my son. God bless you."
   
 When Ryan's fiancee spoke, she began explaining the dress she was wearing for the occasion.
   
 In a white dress, Wilkins recalled that a year into dating, Ryan said he wanted to get married, often suggesting eloping. While they had a wedding ceremony planned in the fall, she kept a white dress in her car, in case an opportunity arose to marry the love of her life.
   
 "I could stand up here for days telling you stories about Ryan and all of the reasons I love him," she said.
   
 But instead, she reflected on what has brought her peace, particularly the knowledge that she and Ryan made the most out of their time together. They were happiest just being with the kids at the pond, and had just finished up one of the most memorable summers of their lives, she added.
   
 "Because Ryan and I knew this day was a possibility every time he went to work, we tried our best to live every day to the fullest," she said.
   
 "I know he had no regrets, and neither do I."
   
 She closed her tribute in Ryan's own words, reading from a message he sent encouraging her to pursue a job she loved, just like he had.
   
 "I love you, supergirl. People in training don't get asked if they want a job unless they have a heart for that job. You have found your calling and you love what you do. No matter what is thrown at you, keep your chin up. You will find a home where you love to work. You have a good heart, and a beautiful accent. Keep up the good work. You have a family that is cheering you on. I love you and I miss you."

 Strength in our lower bodies is not only good for us but is a necessity for everyday life. In addition to walking, we sit and stand, bend and squat, lean and lunge, and everything else in between. All of those motions require leg strength, and to attain that, variety is key.
 Our move today is a step back lunge. This exercise will be working your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. All you need is a smooth surface for lunging.
 To begin this exercise, start by standing tall with your feet placed about hip-width. Holding your chest up, and engaging your abdominals for added balance, step back with your right foot.
 Keeping the weight on the ball of your foot; proceed to sit into the extended leg by bending in that knee. Your front knee will be bending as well but be mindful to keep the positioning behind the front foot.
 Continue to bend and sit into this step back lunge as low as you are comfortable doing then proceed to push back up to your starting position. Stand tall, with both feet returned to level ground. Then repeat the same movement on the left side.
 Keeping your hands positioned just on your hips, shoot for at least eight to 10 lunges on each side for three sets each.
 If you need intensity, you can hold a set of hand weights in each hand. And if you need a little help with balance, you can hold a broomstick just in front of you.
 If you have issues with knee pain, you can keep the lunge shallow. Just be mindful to engage the muscles you are focusing on.
 This step back lunge is great added into any lower body routine, and is also a great move to help with balance and stability.
