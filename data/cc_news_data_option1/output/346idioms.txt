By any measure, Kobe Bryant was one of the greatest players in NBA history.The retired Los Angeles Lakers star, who died Sunday in a helicopter crash at age 41, was proudest of his five championship rings, the most recent in 2010. Only four NBA players who weren&amp;rsquo;t on the Boston Celtics&amp;rsquo; 1960s dynasty teams have won more titles. Bryant reached seven NBA Finals.His career was remarkable for its longevity and because he played all 20 seasons with the Lakers &amp;mdash; the most ever for one team. Bryant was the fifth player to last two full decades.Bryant scored 33,643 career points, third-most in league history, and averaged 25.0 points per game, including a 60-point performance in his final game on April 13, 2016. His 81-point game in on Jan. 22, 2006, against the Toronto Raptors was the second-highest scoring performance in the NBA and arguably the most dazzling single-game offensive performance in hoops history.He was an 18-time All-Star, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and the 2008 NBA MVP.Bryant's post-playing career in the entertainment industry began auspiciously when he won an Oscar for &amp;ldquo;Dear Basketball,&amp;rdquo; an animated short film based on the letter he wrote announcing his retirement.

As Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham enters the second year of an education overhaul she promised on the campaign trail — and a state judge mandated months before she took office — she and other policymakers say the changes will come over decades, not within legislative sessions.
 They point to persistent problems, such as low rates of student proficiency in math and reading and high numbers of high school dropouts, and say solutions will require years of steadily increasing investments in building an education workforce that suffers from a severe shortage.
 They say initiating programs to aid the state's most vulnerable kids and extending classroom time — both expensive propositions — are a start, but add the effort requires New Mexico to rethink how it views education funding.
 "People say we just throw money at it, but we haven't ever tried throwing money at it," said state Sen. Mimi Stewart, an Albuquerque Democrat who serves on the Senate Education Committee. "We've done nothing but underfund for years. It's about time we threw some money at this."
 A year ago, Lujan Grisham and the Legislature were under a judge's order in a years-long civil suit, Yazzie/Martinez v. State of New Mexico, to address a long-standing issue: providing too few resources to educate kids from low- income families, special-education students, Native American children and English-language learners.
 Armed with a windfall of new oil and gas money, the state approved a $480 million surge for public schools, in part to comply with the judge's order. Lujan Grisham and the Legislature are proposing another increase this year of more than $200 million.
 Some critics have said that's not enough.
 At the same time, some lawmakers already have grown weary of the court order for heavier investments in education.
 "Judges shouldn't be legislating from the bench, and I think that's what has happened here," Sen. Clemente Sanchez, D-Grants, said at a legislative hearing last month. "I think we've focused too much only on satisfying the Martinez- Yazzie lawsuit."
 Stewart said not all legislators understand "what we're up against and how long it's going to take to turn kids around."
 Sen. Bill Soules, a Las Cruces Democrat who chairs the Senate Education Committee and teaches a pair of Advanced Placement Psychology classes at Oñate High School, expressed similar frustration.
 "People need to realize we didn't get to the bottom in one year. This is years and years of digging ourselves into a hole," he said.
 Tripp Stelnicki, a spokesman for the governor, said Lujan Grisham also believes it will take time to see significant results from reforms and increased investments.
 In an email, Stelnicki wrote, "When we talk about the 'moonshot' " — a word the governor used frequently last year in reference to a surge in education funding — "we're talking about the genuine transformation of our cradle-to- career public education system. And that does take time. We have to stay the course."
 Soules, and a handful of other educators-turned-Legislators, say change begins with attracting more teachers — and keeping them in classrooms. In fall 2019, the state had 644 vacancies for full-time public school teachers, according to a report from New Mexico State University; that was down from 740 in fall 2018.
 The report also found New Mexico schools fall short by 400 educational assistants, counselors, psychologists and other professionals who largely help support students deemed at risk of failing or dropping out.
 School district officials and some legislators call the workforce shortage a crisis. Teacher vacancies are filled with long-term substitutes, who aren't required to have a teaching license.
 "When people say we should put money into students who are at-risk, I say there are no students more at-risk than those without a qualified teacher in their classroom," Stewart said.
 One effort to draw teachers is a rise in the pay scale. Last year, Lujan Grisham and the Legislature approved 6 percent raises for teachers. Spending proposals for the next fiscal year include additional raises — 6 percent in the governor's plan and 4 percent in the Legislature's.
 A bill introduced in the current legislative session would create a pilot mentorship program connecting first-year teachers with experienced educators, with a goal of keeping more young teachers in the field longer.
 Veronica García, superintendent of Santa Fe Public Schools, said she thinks the proposed pay hikes are too low.
 "We have a teacher shortage crisis," she said. "Our salaries aren't competitive, and whatever in-state pipeline we might have had dried up over the past decade."
 García said she has been advertising the district's open teaching positions in seven states, Puerto Rico and Spain, and she has called retirees in hopes of enticing them back into the classroom.
 While New Mexico teachers have seen pay raises in recent years, they're still not on par with educators in other states. According to the latest data from the National Education Association, New Mexico ranked 48th in the nation for teacher pay in 2017-18, with an average salary of $47,152. The national average was $60,477.
 The state's overall spending on education is nearly 20 percent below the national average, according to a report by _Education Week_.
 Bill Mathis, managing director of the National Education Policy Center, based in Boulder, Colo., and a former school superintendent in Vermont, predicted it will take years of large investments for New Mexico to catch up.
 He pointed to a new report by the Vermont legislature that recommended districts spend 300 percent more on students living in poverty than their wealthier peers and 150 percent more on English-language learners — two of the groups of students cited in New Mexico's Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit as underserved.
 It's difficult to estimate a time frame for when districts would see the results of a funding surge, Mathis said, and he called it a "fallacy" to try to connect funding levels with education outcomes.
 "You're going to see returns in less crime and more people in well-paying jobs, but tying money directly to academic achievement is virtually impossible," he said.
 To help narrow an achievement gap for low-income kids, Lujan Grisham has pushed to extend the school year — another initiative that requires more funding.
 Last summer, the state spent $29 million on a 25-day summer program that served 18,000 low-income students in grades K-5. The Public Education Department is requesting $68.4 million to offer the program, K-5 Plus, to 50,000 students this summer.
 The department also wants to double its funding for a program that offers 10 days of extra classroom time, to $95.6 million in 2020-21 from $42.3 million this year. With the increase, the initiative would reach more than half of the state's 330,000 students.
 García said she sees K-5 Plus and extended learning time as steps toward a year-round school calendar — an idea she supports.
 But state Rep. Rebecca Dow, R-Truth or Consequences, who co-founded an early childhood education center in Sierra County, cautioned against a universal extension.
 "There will never be enough money," she said.
 "With limited resources, we have to be targeted and strategic," Dow added. "... We can't just add days to the school calendar and expect that to work for every district."

The tragic news of Kobe Bryant's death sent shock waves around the sports world Sunday.
   
 Athletes, coaches, reporters, fans and even US presidents took to social media and reacted with heartache and prayers with the news of the NBA superstar's passing, along with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. They died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, along with seven others.
   
 Kobe Bryant's legacy as a basketball player will be felt for as long as the game is played. His legacy extended beyond basketball to all walks of life, including the University of Alabama football team.
   
 In 2018 the Crimson Tide received a visit from the five-time NBA champion. Bryant spoke to the team about being a leader and being successful. Bryant sat down with Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban and the two discussed the "process" and facing adversity, among other topics.
   
 Saban released a statement Sunday following the announcement of Bryant's death.
   
 "The world lost a truly special person today. Our hearts go out to Kobe's family, friends and all who loved him as both a basketball player and a person. Kobe was one of the greatest to ever play the game. But what truly separated him was his competitive spirit and unmatched work ethic. When Kobe spoke to our team, he talked about how he went to work knowing how perfect was unattainable but put everything into closing the gap on perfect every day. This is an unbelievably sad day. He leaves a tremendous legacy for all who knew and loved him."
      
 The news of Bryant's death hit home for Alabama basketball coach Nate Oats.
   
 "As a father of 3 daughters myself my heart is broken at the news of Kobe today," Oats stated on Twitter. "Prayers are with his family and the families of others involved in the accident. Life is short. Take time to tell your loved ones how much you love them today."
   
 The news of Bryant's death happened in the middle of the Crimson Tide women's basketball game against Vanderbilt at Coleman Coliseum. Alabama head coach Kristy Curry found out just moments before the start of the game.
   
 "About 30 seconds before I walked out," Curry said. "There are so many more important things than a win today and I think that really puts it all in perspective. I appreciate all he's done for women's sports and to see how he supported the WNBA. Those are the things that come to my mind.
   
 "It's just a really sad day for basketball. I really didn't want our kids (before the game) to know because so many of our kids look up to him."
   
 Sunday's crash also had profound effect on former Crimson Tide baseball player Wade Waas. Orange Coast College coach John Altobelli, who was also killed in the crash, coached Waas in the Cape Cod league.
   
 Crimson Tide basketball and football players expressed their disbelief on Bryant's death through social media.
   
 "This hurts on a different level," said Alabama basketball player Jaden Shackelford. "RIP to the mamba, one of my childhood heroes."
   
 Said sophomore guard Kira Lewis, "I can't believe this."
   
 Former Crimson Tide defensive back Xavier McKinney, who declared for the NFL Draft, posted a photo on Twitter with him and Bryant during the 2018 Tuscaloosa visit.
   
 "I'm at a loss for words," he said
   
 Former Alabama linebacker Terrell Lewis said, "I can't even lie, this Kobe news hurt my heart! This feels unreal but my prayers go out to his family and all those that he inspired! His legacy will live forever! Rest In Paradise Kobe and GiGi!."
   
 Former Alabama running back and current Tennessee Titans player Derrick Henry sent a message on Twitter from Orlando at the Pro Bowl, saying, "To my favorite Athlete Of All Time @kobebryant I love you bro & Rest In Peace to you & your daughter Gianna. I pray God covers your family."

 Lacey Cornwell, from Adel, has a mission to connect people in the community and promote open and honest dialogue. She feels that by joining with others in a group setting, either big or small, provides many benefits like finding new friends and realizing you aren't alone.
   
 "We are better together. I just want to serve the community by helping stimulate, connect, encourage and challenge others as they lean into their gifts," Cornwell said.
   
 Cornwell, along with her husband Jay, daughter Mckinley (10), son Owen (8) and cat Kona, moved to Adel the end of 2016. She realized that commuting to work and having most of her relationships outside of Adel, she wasn't taking advantage of what this small community had to offer.
   
 Cornwell grew up in central Florida and has also lived in Kansas and Iowa. She has a degree in Business and Leadership Studies from William Penn University and also a certification in Change Management from Cornell University.
   
 "I had an early first career in retail sales, management, and as a buyer, mostly in the small business sector," Cornwell said. "After getting married, I started my career in corporate, working in administration, operations, management, business analysis and honing my skills in coaching and facilitating."
   
 For the past 3 years, Cornwell has owned and runs a LuLaRoe clothing boutique.
   
 "I'm a big dreamer and like to encourage others to do the same, so you never know what I might take on next," she added.
   
 In 2018, Cornwell left her corporate career to move toward her long-term goal of being self-employed in the life and coaching space. This time away from the corporate world gave her time to find out who she is. This also gave her time to be there for people within the Adel community and help bring people together.
   
 "I've spent the last year consulting and am currently launching my life and business coaching business, which focuses on helping small businesses and women in life transitions…identify next steps and take intentional action," Cornwell said.
   
 Cornwell's new business is called Ritual & Co. She will be hosting a series of workshops and retreats that serve women and small businesses. She helped host a recent women's retreat at Harmony Hall.
   
 One of Cornwell's first groups was a mom's group that formed two years ago. This group formed from moms feeling a bit sad after the first day of school drop off. Cornwell doesn't frequent this group much anymore, but the group continues.
   
 "One thing that's important to remember, some groups don't need structure or a leader, they just need people showing up and creating space to be," she added. "Obviously, all groups aren't that way, but when bringing people together we have to be careful to not overcomplicate it."
   
 Within group settings, Cornwell strongly encourages meaningful dialogue. She feels that one way to do this is to start asking questions. She feels that meaningful dialogue helps us move forward by learning and growing.
   
 "Take the time to ask about more than the weather or how the kids are doing," she said. "Questions about family traditions, challenges, the future… really anything that people don't get asked daily is a great place to start."
   
 To find a group that might be a good fit for you, Cornwell recommends looking at the scheduled events on community Facebook pages, the coffee shops and the library.
   
 "Adel Positivity is a great example of a Facebook group that continuously serves as a connection point," she said. "Individuals ask if something exists, and if it does, they get connected. If it doesn't already exist, and is truly a need, others who are interested end up commenting as well, so if the need and drive is great enough a group can form."
   
 Cornwell listed some groups that she is familiar with in the Adel area.There are mom's groups that meet at 3rd Place on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.Harmony Hall is open on Thursdays from 11 a.m. into the evening and sometimes holds networking or craft events in the evenings.The Table is a gathering of women who meet the first Friday of every month.The American Legion meets the first Monday of the month.Kiwanis meets every Tuesday at 7 a.m.The Lions and Rotary clubs also meet and serve regularly.The Chamber of Commerce has monthly meetings for their members.There is a group called, Dallas County Games, that meets at different locations around the county to play board games.There is a group that meets for yoga at 5:15 a.m. on Monday mornings at the Raccoon Valley Bank community house.Adel also has a number of churches that have events and ways to get connected to others, even if you aren't a member of that church.There are currently two other business/professional minded groups forming that Cornwell is aware of, one being This is Adel. The other group is a young professionals' group that is called Community Collective that will meet the last Thursday of every month.
   
 Cornwell's favorite thing about meeting in a group setting is, you don't have an excuse not to go. She recommends bringing a friend if you feel uncomfortable or fearful about joining a group.
   
 She quoted Shirley Maclaine who said, "Fear makes strangers of people that would be friends. It's worth the risk to find a few places to connect and see who you might meet and what you might learn."

I didn't make it to midnight on New Year's Eve. Well, I guess technically I did since I didn't actually fall asleep until after midnight. But I was in bed with the lights out when the clock, that I didn't hear, struck the new year.
 Over the years, I've come to recognize that the arrival of the new year isn't dependent upon my staying awake to ring it in. Whether or not I'm awake at the stroke of midnight, the new year still arrives. And that's rather freeing! Despite the more-than-you'd-think emails mistakenly addressed to me as "Father Time," I bear no responsibility for the transition from one year to the next.
 I didn't make any New Year's resolutions this year. This isn't unusual for me, as I can't remember the last time I did. I can get all philosophical, "time is a false construct," or delude myself into thinking to channel Mr. Rogers, I'm fine just the way I am. While my wife and brother have made a pact to give up sugar, I just couldn't come up with anything. Despite all the "New Year! New You!" ads for gyms and hair care products, I'm pretty sure God still loves the old me.
 This week a friend forwarded me an article about a Lutheran pastor from Canada with the headline "Meet the Strongest Priest in the World." Apparently, the Rev. Kevin Fast, who bears a strong resemblance to a jacked-up Santa Claus, pulled three firetrucks weighing 109 tons across a 100-foot parking lot in just 34 seconds. He's also on record, with video evidence, as having pulled 15 cars at once.
 All of which is to say, I could resolve to double my efforts at the gym. Pastor Fast, maybe I could, ironically enough, outrun him, makes my exploits on the StairMaster at Planet Fitness seem rather pedestrian.
 I didn't eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. This brings good luck, apparently. Black-eyed peas weren't part of my tradition growing up, or maybe my parents just decided to take their chances. But either way, seeing all those Facebook posts of people preparing black-eyed peas for their New Year's Day celebrations makes me wonder what I'm missing and how luckier I'd be if I'd partaken.
 There's evidence that the tradition goes back to Rosh Hashanah and the celebration of the Jewish New Year, but these days it's mostly a Southern thing. In the Civil War era, black-eyed peas were grown as food for livestock and became a staple of slaves. When Gen. Sherman undertook his infamous March to the Sea, he destroyed all the crops deemed useful to the Confederate Army. He ignored the black-eyed peas, figuring they weren't fit for human consumption. Those left in the South gratefully subsisted on the peas and ever since they have been viewed as a symbol of luck and prosperity, particularly fit for a celebration of the New Year.
 So while 2020 begins for me with many unrealized traditions, I am nonetheless optimistic. Hindsight may indeed be 2020, but I pray that we will have the foresight to live into the future with peace, hope, and love. In the end, that's really all that matters.

 Happy New Year; I hope everyone has a healthy and prosperous one.
 We celebrated the holiday in Gulf Shores, Alabama, with our oldest son, Brian, and his family. The grandchildren are growing up so fast. Isaac is now 17, Sam is 14, and Paige is 12. They are all so active and busy it is hard to find a time when we all can get together, so we always save the week of New Year's to celebrate and be together for a week's vacation. Usually my youngest, Michael, and his family join us, but he just started a new job and was unable to get away.
 We stayed in two condos at Gulf Shores Plantation, and it was really nice. We had taken food with as, and I prepared usually breakfast and dinner every day in the condo and we would all meet to eat together.
 The one time we did eat out was at Lambert's Cafe, which the kids look forward to on every trip. Those rolls still fly at high speeds, and the kids love to see who can catch the farthest throw. Paige won the honor this year, catching a throw almost across the entire cafe. The food is actually so much like home cooking I could almost believe my Mom was in the kitchen making the fried potatoes and onions in her cast-iron skillet.
 We also toured Fort Morgan, just down the road from our condos. That fort has an incredible history, most famous for being built for the War of 1812 and its use during the Civil War. We took a lot of pictures and had a great time investigating all the nooks and crannies.
 We did our share of collecting shells on the beaches, wading in the waves, swimming in the heated pools and playing tennis and basketball, but my favorite thing to do was kayaking in Mobile Bay. It was so peaceful and enjoyable and the best way to get close and personal to the array of waterfowl just off the beach. Isaac and I were kayaking one afternoon and got back just at sunset. We have some incredible pictures that look like we are paddling into the sun.
 Paige, since she is the only girl in their family, brought along a friend with her to enjoy the vacation with. Her friend, Mariko, was extremely enjoyable and added something new to our adventures. She and Paige went swimming and played tennis and basketball every day. Mariko is also an accomplished violinist who brought along her violin to play for us. She gave us two incredible concerts that we thoroughly enjoyed. Isaac is an accomplished violinist as well, and he also played for us one evening. How lucky we were to have private concerts just for us.
 When the kids weren't busy, especially in the evenings, we played board games or watched a movie and just enjoyed being together as a family. Something I don't get to do very often with us living a thousand miles apart. Just all of us being in the same room was truly a gift in itself.
 So for now the holidays are really over. They were truly fabulous this year, and we made such good memories. And that, I think, is what the holidays are really all about.

"I Don't Wanna Ride The Rails No More" -- Vince Gill, songwriter (Vince Gill)


--DocBreak--
“There’s no words to express the pain I’m going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother (at)KobeBryant,” O’Neal wrote on Twitter. “I’m sick right now.”
 A two-time Olympic gold medalist with the dominant U.S. team, Bryant retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final NBA game. In December 2017, the Lakers hung banners retiring his No. 8 and No. 24 jerseys in the Staples Center rafters in an unprecedented double honor.
 Bryant looms large over the current generation of NBA players, most of whom grew up either idolizing Bryant or absorbing his work ethic and competitive spirit in the same way Bryant’s generation learned from Michael Jordan.
 After James passed Bryant on Saturday, he remembered listening to Bryant when the superstar came to speak at a childhood basketball camp.
 “I remember one thing he said: If you want to be great at it, or want to be one of the greats, you’ve got to put the work in,” James said.
 James later teamed up with Bryant on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team in Beijing.
 “He had zero flaws offensively,” James said. “Zero. You backed off of him, he could shoot the 3. You body him up a little bit, he could go around you. He could shoot from mid-range. He could post. He could make free throws. ... He was just immortal offensively because of his skill set and his work ethic.”
 Bryant was a basketball superstar for his entire adult life. He entered the NBA draft straight out of high school in 1996 after a childhood spent partly in Italy, where his father, former NBA player Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, played professionally. He spoke four languages, and was a huge part of the NBA’s international growth, traveling the world, connecting with athletes in other sports and celebrities.
 The Lakers acquired the 17-year-old Bryant in a trade shortly after Charlotte drafted him, and he immediately became one of the most exciting and intriguing players in the sport alongside O’Neal, who had signed with the Lakers as a free agent. Bryant won the slam-dunk contest as a rookie, and the Lakers gradually grew into a team that won three consecutive championships.
 Bryant and Gasol formed the nucleus of another championship team in 2008, reaching three straight NBA Finals and winning two more titles.
 Between those title runs and before the quiet final years of his career, Bryant accomplished innumerable feats, including an 81-point game against Toronto in January 2006. Bryant’s final NBA seasons were dogged by injuries, but he still went into retirement with a jaw-dropping 60-point performance against Utah.

By any measure, Kobe Bryant was one of the greatest players in NBA history.
 The retired Los Angeles Lakers star, who died Sunday in a helicopter crash at age 41, was proudest of his five championship rings, the most recent in 2010. Only four NBA players who weren't on the Boston Celtics' 1960s dynasty teams have won more titles. Bryant reached seven NBA Finals.
 His career was remarkable for its longevity and because he played all 20 seasons with the Lakers -- the most ever for one team. Bryant was the fifth player to last two full decades.
 Bryant scored 33,643 career points, third-most in league history, and averaged 25.0 points per game, including a 60-point performance in his final game on April 13, 2016. His 81-point game in on Jan. 22, 2006, against the Toronto Raptors was the second-highest scoring performance in the NBA and arguably the most dazzling single-game offensive performance in hoops history.
 He was an 18-time All-Star, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and the 2008 NBA MVP.
 Bryant's post-playing career in the entertainment industry began auspiciously when he won an Oscar for "Dear Basketball," an animated short film based on the letter he wrote announcing his retirement.

At Ajinomoto's factory outside of Tokyo, a steady stream of visitors join tours where they sample miso soup with and without MSG, and snap selfies with the firm's mascot — the red-and-white AjiPanda. Elsewhere, however, MSG is regarded as less benign, with some detractors dubbing it a "killer condiment" and people reporting side-effects, including headaches, sweats and skin flushing.
 The unsavory reputation dates back to a 1968 letter by Chinese American doctor Robert Ho Man Kwok printed in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kwok described symptoms he experienced while eating at Chinese restaurants in the U.S., including "numbness at the back of the neck … general weakness and palpitation." His Chinese friends — "all well educated" — experienced similar sensations, he wrote. He proposed several potential reasons, including soy sauce, cooking wine, MSG and high sodium content, and suggested "friends in the medical field" research this "peculiar syndrome."
 The letter was picked up by the media and made its way into the public imagination, creating a lasting association between MSG and various, poorly defined health effects.
 Most scientific research, however, suggests "Chinese restaurant syndrome" is a myth.
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels MSG "generally recognized as safe," the same as salt, corn syrup or caffeine. Authorities in Europe, Australia and elsewhere also rate it safe to consume.
 "The long-standing claim that the intake of MSG in food causes 'Chinese restaurant syndrome' in humans is unfounded," says Guoyao Wu, a professor of animal science at Texas A&M University who has studied MSG.
 Some of the experiments suggesting MSG is harmful involved administering huge doses or injecting the compound directly into muscle or brain tissue.
 "Well-controlled scientific experiments have not shown any adverse effects of oral MSG … on healthy people or relevant animal models," Wu says.
 That's the message that Ajinomoto is now pushing in a $10-million, three-year PR blitz.
 "There's really no doubt that it's a safe food ingredient," insists Tia M. Rains, who is heading up Ajinomoto's campaign. The message is directed primarily at the U.S., where the firm has staged a "World Umami Forum" and enlisted food experts to sway public opinion.
 MSG was once popular with American cooks, sold under the brand Accent. Now Ajinomoto mostly sells directly to businesses, which use MSG in popular products such as potato chips and salad dressings.
 The PR project comes with a shift already underway in the Western food world. Not only is the concept of umami well-established, but authorities, including food science writer Harold McGee and Michelin-starred chef David Chang, have pushed back against the idea that MSG is dangerous.
 In Japan, there isn't much of a debate about the product, says Kazumi Masuda, who runs the cooking school Tokyo Cook. Her students are taught to extract umami from traditional ingredients, including _konbu_ seaweed, but she sees no harm in using MSG-laden stock cubes, particularly for busy home cooks.
 "There's not a big argument (about it). More (people) have the image that if you use MSG, then it's like cheating," she says with a laugh. "I don't use it every week, but I think many Japanese families use it more often."
 Rains argues that MSG could even have health benefits, as it can help people cut down on salt. But Ka He, a professor of reproductive science and epidemiology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, urges caution.
 "Safety and health are two different concepts," says He, who has also studied MSG. "Sugar is safe but it may not be healthy, trans fat is not toxic but sufficient scientific evidence indicates that it's a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases."
 Rains says Ajinomoto doesn't expect to convert everyone, but hopes an umami overhaul might open some eyes.
 "We're not trying to hide behind the umami," she says, "but make that connection for people, that they're one and the same."
