So we've started in the lower grade area. And the grades that we're getting out on average are probably sitting a bit below 2 grams a tonne at the moment over the quarter, between 1.6 and 2 grams. It's okay. It's not spectacular. But it's not what -- it's kind of what we were expecting. So we always knew that it would be a slow start to the Rosemont Underground, and we really wouldn't start to kick some higher grades until we get over into the main area, which is -- and the reason we didn't go there, first off, was because we were still mining in the open pit above it.

ISABEL -- Tia Gilleece has been riding a horse before she could walk. With Bit & Spur Training, she has recently taken her lifetime of knowledge as a horsewoman and started a place where she can teach others what she has learned about riding and life.
   
 "Bit & Spur offers an array of services such as speed events, roping, reining, horsemanship, working on balancing along with posture. Basics of riding to more advanced," Gilleece said. "One thing I like to do with older kids is to take them to move cattle. It's a skill that honestly helps boost their confidence and an experience they can say they have."
   
 Gilleece's training facility is located about 5 miles northeast of Isabel. She said none of this would be possible without a generous donation of land by Vernon and Donna Hirt of Sawyer. These lessons are put on display at "fun shows," which Gilleece said started a few months ago. The third and final show is this Saturday, Oct. 24. She said she plans to start up with the fun shows again next spring, when the days lengthen and the weather is more cooperative
   
 "My favorite part, well parts, is watching my students become better riders, grow in confidence and achieve goals they have set. It's honestly hard to pick a favorite," Gilleece said. "I love watching all my riders achieving milestones. They will tell you I sometimes get a little over-excited and may scare them with my enthusiasm. I can't help it."
   
 Gilleece said the main focus of Bit & Spur Training is the riding lessons for students ages 2 to 71. She said each rider is different, which means they can have different goals. Lessons can be done individually or in groups.
   
 Oakley Panek, of Cunningham, has been taking riding lessons from Bit & Spur Training. Oakley is 5 years old and her mother, Jamie Panek, said she had never been on a horse before Gilleece started training her.
   
 "She has learned how to maneuver her horse and make him stop by herself. She has learned a lot more of the foundation of riding this fall than what I anticipated she would," Panek said.
   
 Kyrian Keeling, a high school horse rider from Pratt, said she has made leaps and bounds she has made under the directions of Gilleece and other Bit & Spur trainers. She has learned how to saddle her horse, ride patterns, reigning, showmanship and bareback riding skills. That might not be the most important thing Keeling has learned, though.
   
 "Just as important as the technical side of horse riding, the Bit and Spur family has given me a new found confidence in myself and a sense of pride in doing things I never imagined I could do," Keeling said. "They are so positive, patient and encouraging of me in every aspect of my riding but also in my day to day life as well."
   
 Gilleece gets her knowledge from being born and raised on the back of a horse and attributes all of her knowledge to her mom and dad. Besides Bit & Spur Training, she is a stay-at-home mom and works for her dad and other ranchers.

When you think of the first bizjet, you might think of the Lear 23, the Lockheed JetStar or the North American Sabreliner. Only the Lear is a personal jet in any respect, and the JetStar and Sabre are pretty big airplanes, the JetStar especially. But the Paris Jet was a truly right-sized private jet, and a single-pilot jet, to boot. A twin-engine French model that weighs well under 10,000 pounds at gross, it was originally intended for a contract competition to provide a plane for the training of would-be fighter pilots and the shuttling about of officers. After losing out in that competition, its designers quickly pivoted, threw in a couple of extra seats and called it a private jet. Over the years, the Paris Jet has resurfaced a number of times, though it has never gotten much traction despite not-terrible performance, 310 knots with about an 800-nm range. The company built 219 of them, mostly for military use, and there are still a good number of them about. Downsides are, they are loud and expensive to operate for performance you could get with a used TBM at operating costs way less than half of the outlay for flying a Paris Jet.

Trump countered by pointing out his efforts on criminal justice reform and blasting Biden's support of a 1990s Crime Bill that many feel disproportionately incarcerated Black men. Staring into the crowd, he declared himself “the least racist person in this room."
 Turning to foreign policy, Biden accused Trump of dealing with a “thug” while holding summits with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. And closer to home, the former vice president laced into the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents trying to illegally cross the southern border.
 Biden said that America has learned from a New York Times report that Trump only paid $750 a year in federal taxes while holding “a secret bank account" in China. The former vice president then noted he’s released all of his tax returns going back 22 years and challenged the president to release his returns, saying, “What are you hiding?”
 Trump said he closed his former account in China and claimed his accountants told him he “prepaid tens of millions of dollars” in taxes. However, as he has for the past four years after promising to release his taxes, he declined to say when he might do so.
 Trump said that when it comes to health care, he would like “to terminate” the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, even amid a pandemic, and come up “with a brand new beautiful health care,” that protects coverage for preexisting conditions. Biden said the president has been talking about making such a move for years but “he’s never come up with a plan.”
 He also denounced Trump's claim that Biden wanted to socialize medicine, creating daylight between himself and the more liberal members of his party whom he defeated in the Democratic primaries.
 “He thinks he’s running against somebody else," the former vice president said. “He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them.”
 It remained to be seen if Trump, who is trailing in the race, managed to change the trajectory of the campaign. More than 47 million votes have already have been cast, and there are fewer undecided voters than at this point in previous election years.
 The debate, moderated by NBC’s Kristen Welker, was a final chance for each man to make his case to a television audience of tens of millions. And questions swirled beforehand as to how Trump, whose hectoring performance at the first debate was viewed by aides as a mistake that turned off viewers, would perform amid a stretch of the campaign in which he has taken angry aim at the news media and unleashed deeply personal attacks on Biden and his adult son.
 When he feels cornered, Trump has often lashed out, going as negative as possible. In one stunning moment during the 2016 campaign, in an effort to deflect from the release of the Access Hollywood tape in which he is heard boasting about groping women, Trump held a press conference just before a debate with Hillary Clinton during which he appeared with women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. He then invited them to watch as audience members.
 In a similar move, Trump's campaign held another surprise pre-debate news conference, this time featuring Tony Bobulinski, a man who said he was Hunter Biden's former business partner and made unproven allegations that the vice president's son consulted with his father on China-related business dealings.
 Trump made similar, if vague, accusations from the debate stage, but exchanges about Hunter Biden did not dominate the night as aides on both campaigns thought might happen. Biden declared the discussion about family entanglements “malarkey” and accused Trump of not wanting to talk about the substantive issues.
 Turning to the camera and the millions watching at home, he said, “It’s not about his family and my family. It’s about your family, and your family is hurting badly."

On the face of it, that sounds like a wide field of potential patients, but their tumors will need to express the alterations associated with the anti- tumor activity of BDTX-189 based on preclinical studies, which may rule out a large number of potential trialists. Black Diamond says that it will pursue an accelerated approval from the FDA if patients' objective response rate ("ORR"), and duration of response ("DOR") support it, but equally, the company may find itself focusing on a smaller and smaller subset of patients.
 On a more positive note, a trend towards cancer drugs being approved as tumor- agnostic treatments, based on their molecular profile, began in 2017, when Merck's PDL1 inhibitor Keytruda - the world's best-selling cancer treatment with $11.1bn of sales recorded in 2019 - became the first ever oncology drug to be approved in such a way. In 2018, Bayer's Vitrakvi was approved to treat neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase ("NTRK") driven cancers, making it the first drug to be approved to treat a specific genetic alteration in tissue, regardless of site of origin.
 Black Diamond cites these examples as evidence that the future of cancer treatment may lie in genetic, rather than site-specific treatments, as well as the FDA approval of Foundation Medicine's oncology-focused genetic profiling test FoundationOne CDx, and also quotes research that suggests 75 percent of oncologists in the US are currently using genetic sequencing when treating patients.
 Grail (GRAL) - the cancer testing company subject to an $8bn acquisition bid from gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) - is another company with a cancer- blood test that uses genetic screening, so although Black Diamond may be on the fringes of the mainstream treatment market at the present time, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that this can change in the near future.
 ## Financials
 As mentioned earlier, Black Diamond is well-funded at present. As at Q220 the company reported cash of $64m and current assets of $208m, and total liabilities of just $6.3m. To date, the company's cash burn has been surprisingly small - net loss in Q220 was just $15m, and $28m in H120, although this figure has risen by ~180% year on year, and is likely to increase significantly if Black Diamond moves more candidates into early stage trials, and if BDTX-189 progresses into a phase 2/3 trial sometime in 2021.

 While both AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson have paused their trials due to participants falling ill, Collins said that that isn’t unexpected and happens in many trials.
 The federal government has invested in making millions of doses of all of those vaccines, Collins added, so if one or more of them are proven effective, they are already warehoused and ready to be shipped out.
 COUNTY SHERIFF
 While he was sympathetic that the pandemic is tiring for everyone, Favro impressed the fact that the only way that the region will get through this will be together.
 “This virus is impacting each and every one of us, whether you want to believe it or not,” Favro said. “We will be successful, and we will get through these challenging times, but we need to be able to do it together as a team, so that we can work together and help each other get to the other side.”
 The sheriff’s department is not looking to make arrests, Favro said, but if people willfully ignore protective regulations like a 50-person group limit, the department will take action.
 “Make no mistake, that as your chief law enforcement officer in this county, if we have to enforce regulations and laws for non-believers, we will do that,” Favro said. “I’m not posing that as a threat to anyone, I’m promising that I took an oath to protect and serve all residents and guests of Clinton County, and that’s exactly what my team is going to do.”
 Favro stated that the department has received several calls about political rallies in the past few weeks, often on Route 3 near the Market 32 shopping center, but that they have all had mid-thirties to low forties of people in attendance.
 Still, though, he thinks that people should think twice about attending events like that.
 “The science is very clear: minimizing the risk (of spread) is the smart thing to do,” Favro said. “If people choose to get into a large-scale social gathering like that, it’s like being dropped off in the middle of the ocean and swimming at the sharks and hoping you don’t get bit.”
 WINTER SEASON
 The health department's Principal Public Health Educator, Jennifer Trudeau, said she believed that 60 active cases on April 6, when considering both active lab-confirmed positive and probable cases, was the highest that the county had ever hit during the pandemic.
 Until recently, Clinton County has had less than 20 active cases at one time since the end of May 2020, she added.
 As the colder months approach, it’s not entirely unusual to see an increase in cases, the health officials said.
 “The reason that we would expect more cases is because we’re all going to be indoors, and we can’t socially distance in the same way,” Collins said. “It’s more conducive for the virus to last longer in colder temperatures, like a lot of respiratory viruses.”
 There were more people inherently socially distancing by taking part in outdoor activities this summer, leading to lower numbers, Kanoza added, saying that schools, colleges and senior homes will continue to be a big focus in the months ahead with more people heading indoors.
 “We urge residents to not become complacent in their daily activities,” Kanoza said. “We need all of you to remember the hard work and sacrifices you all have made over the last several months, and to keep practicing the protective safety measures you’ve been doing all along.”

The Trump administration said the Census Bureau needed to end the count early to meet the Dec. 31 deadline. But top officials at the Census Bureau said as recently as July that it would still be impossible to process all of the data by the end of the year. They've since changed their tune, and on Wednesday said in a conference call with the news media that the deadline can be met by working around the clock and with technological advances in computer processing.
 Groups suing the administration over the timetables said the deadline for turning in apportionment numbers was moved up to accommodate an order from Trump to exclude people in the U.S. illegally from the numbers used to divvy up congressional seats among the states. Sticking to a Dec. 31 deadline ensures that data processing remains under the administration's control, regardless of who wins the presidential election.
 A panel of federal judges in New York ruled that Trump's order was unlawful, but the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court.
 “This census isn’t over,” Morial said. “We will continue to fight in the courts, Congress and the court of public opinion.”

District of Texas, this is where Corpus Christi, Texas, is and that seat is currently represented by a Tea Party freshman named Blake Farenthold — a very sort of legendary name in Texas is his grandmother Sissy Farenthold, who was a liberal icon there. Blake Farenthold is not a liberal — he managed to eke out a victory. He won by something like 900 votes in a recount, beating a veteran Hispanic incumbent, Solomon Ortiz, in a district that is something like 90 percent Hispanic. Eight-six percent of Hispanics voted against Blake Farenthold. How did he win? Because the Hispanic turnout was abysmally low in this midterm year, and there was a very, very high Tea Party turnout, which favored Farenthold. So he won but knew he was living on borrowed time — that the demographics of his district were such that unless there was another wave election, he would likely be swept out. So Farenthold was very, very hopeful that redistricting would favor him. And it did. The Republicans took the 27th District. They saw their endangered new Republican inhabitant, and what they did simply was saw off the district the town of Brownsville, which is where the preponderance of Hispanics in his districts reside. And instead, they redrew the map, minus Brownsville, and into an area, a corridor further north and west that is distinctly Republican. And so, Farenthold — I find to be a very self-effacing and plainspoken congressman — and I asked him, 'So why didn't you just say, "Look, I'm content with the district that I have and I'm willing to compete to win in my district yet again." ' And he said, 'Look , I would rather have a 60 percent Republican district than a swing district any day — duh.' So that's what he has. And for the next 10 years, he is essentially protected as a Republican."

A treatment also better used in the early days of the sickness and that has been used at CVPH, according to Collins, has been convalescent plasma therapy.
 Donated blood from a recovered COVID-19 patient is processed to remove blood cells, leaving behind plasma and antibodies, according to the Mayo Clinic’s website, to then use to provide COVID-19 antibodies to a patient.
 “It’s not something that everyone agrees is helpful,” Collins said. “I think it’s a very low-risk option, and the benefits are far and away not proven, but there are some studies suggesting that it can be a benefit, particularly when used early in the disease.”
 While these treatments are far more than the healthcare world had to work with at the beginning of the pandemic, the public shouldn’t look at remdesevir or convalescent plasma therapy as miracle cures.
 “Once you’ve reached the point that you’re in the ICU and need to be on a breathing machine, neither remdesevir or convalescent plasma are likely to make much difference,” Collins said.

 Kachejian, a sophomore who lives on-campus, said that the SUNY Plattsburgh TV station is still active and they are still able to do news. The main priority is social distancing.
 “But with cases rising, it doesn’t look like we might be able to do that for much longer. But that’s still very up in the air,” he said.
 Kachejian, who lives with a chronic autoimmune condition, takes COVID safety protocols seriously.
 “I’m kind of high risk when it comes to this situation. In that way, I am definitely making sure that I’m taking care myself and doing all the things that we’re required to do,” he said.
 “I don’t ever really go anywhere with big numbers. I’m only around maybe two friends at the most. Me and my roommate never have really anyone else in the room.”
 At least one of Kachejian’s majors requires hands-on and immersive learning, much like Allen’s, and much like many students at SUNY Plattsburgh who are there to pursue dreams of a career.
 “The thing that worries me the most is having to transition back home," Kachejian said.
 "Being a double-major is already so much stress as it is. Being told that I can’t do things a familiar way anymore really sets me back. And I think a lot of kids are dealing with that.
 "I’ve had friends that have had to go home because of how stressed they are here.”

The important thing is that everyone is on board and understands the scenario and be open to adapt to these. The major challenge was to get all of them on the same page and make them understand why we are making certain decisions and to get them to agree to it," Varun said.

Job growth and housing go hand in hand as our biggest challenge in rural Minnesota. We need to continue to promote our community as well as strive to streamline our system to make it easier for businesses to come here as well as to expand. We need to continue our close partnership with Redwood County EDA and, with their help, seek out potential new businesses. We also need to listen to the needs of businesses that are already here. We can always do better in that regard. With the recent purchase of two parcels on the west side of town, our next steps will be to come up with a plan for the future of an expanded industrial park as well as a new area for housing.
