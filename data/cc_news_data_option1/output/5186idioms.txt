The run out of India skipper Virat Kohli was massive and it turned to be a momentum-shifting moment, says Australia spinner Nathan Lyon as the hosts snared quick wickets towards the end of the opening day of the first Test to walk off the field smiling, here on Thursday. India looked pretty settled at 188 for three after electing to bat in the series-opener when a terrible mix-up between Ajinkya Rahane and Kohli resulted in run out of the Indian captain, who made 74. When the days proceedings ended, India were 233 for six. It was massive. A wicket like that, run out, specially of Virat is massive. It was good to be back on board after the Ashes. He was batting pretty well, so happy with that, Lyon said at the virtual press conference after the days play.

He said it was wrong to say that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable. In his words: " As a matter of fact, making a federation to work, building a nation or promoting national integration is never a finished business. As the experiences of countries defined by diversity and complexity have shown, the business of a functional federation is actually a work in progress. After all, what’s federalism if not a system of continuous negotiations and compromises. That’s why it’s a gross misnomer when some people pronounce arrogantly that “Nigeria’s unity not negotiable.” That’s wrong. Federations are, of course, subject to negotiations when the need arises in any generation. What is to be done is to accept the reality of negotiation and compromise so as to give everyone a sense of belonging. This will invariably spur a sense of commitment to the union. Come to think of it, there will be negotiations and engagements from generation to generation as issues arise."

Indian captain Virat Kohli scored a gritty half century but could not prevent Australia ending Day 1 in control of proceedings in the Adelaide Test. Kohli, who will be playing only this Test, scored 74 off 180 deliveries before a terrible bit of miscommunication with Ajinkya Rahane led to the captain’s dismissal – a key moment given the duo were starting to up the scoring rate but instead it allowed Australia to further tighten the screws.Australia, who handed a debut to all-rounder Cameron Green, were impressive through the day and hardly ever lost control.

"In Germany we will start, if the approval comes as planned, on Dec. 27. The other countries in the EU want to be able to start and want to start from Dec. 27," Health Minister Jens Spahn said before an online meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel and executives from vaccine maker BioNTech. As a member of the EU, Germany is obliged, by and large, to wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to approve the vaccine. The EMA is expected to make an announcement on Dec. 21.

To be honest, part of me had been secretly hoping that I had received the placebo. I had asked when my trial started what would happen if another vaccine was approved first. The doctor in charge had strongly suggested that I'd be told what I'd been injected with - a process known as "unblinding." I could then get the approved vaccine - provided I had received the placebo. But if I had received the actual Novavax vaccine, he said, it could be risky because receiving two vaccines targeting the same disease could cause a reaction. An email I received from the UK's National Health Service - "INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN LIGHT OF NEWS ABOUT PFIZER/BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE" - basically confirmed that people who received the placebo would be able to get the approved vaccine once it was offered to them. Volunteers will not be "disadvantaged," it stated.
