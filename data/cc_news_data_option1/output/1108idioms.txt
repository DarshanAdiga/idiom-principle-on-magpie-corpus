Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy are usually performed on the back of the hipbone, or posterior iliac crest. An aspirate can also be obtained from the sternum (breastbone). For the sternal aspirate, the patient lies on their back, with a pillow under the shoulder to raise the chest. A trephine biopsy should never be performed on the sternum, due to the risk of injury to blood vessels, lungs or the heart.

In this regard, the study specifically looked at differences between trees, palms, and lianas (long-stemmed, woody vines that use trees and other plants to climb up to the canopy). Each of these groups differ in terms of the amount of carbon they are able to store due to differences in their ecological strategy. Lianas are, for instance, relatively fast-growing and try to reach the canopy to get to the sunlight, but do not store as much carbon as a tree stem to reach the same height in the canopy.

Jim Buchwald, the oldest living member of the Sub Alpine Club of America, described Wolf Pen Springs as seen from a plane he was flying.  


  "It was like a fairy castle in the woods," Buchwald said.  


  His description proved to be spot on -- even when seen from the ground. Buchwald, 92, was among those present Feb. 15, when I joined the Sub Alpine Club on its 90th anniversary hike. (These days he makes partial hikes.) To commemorate the occasion, the club took the same hike the founders did on Feb. 15, 1930.  


  After wending our way a mile or so up forested hills, we found ourselves in a clearing. At the center of the clearing, a modest sandstone mansion rose from the grounds of the estate.  


  Over the years, Wolf Pen Springs has seen better days. These are among them. Now refurbished, the French Gothic structure looks a lot better than it did when Sub Alpine founders Frank Van Voorhis, Dr. James B. Nelson and Dr. L.B. Walton first hiked there. It was abandoned and run-down then.  


  Van Voorhis wrote a brief history of Wolf Pen Springs in his journal. Eli Nichols built the house around 1840. It was made of sandstone quarried on the property and cut by hand by Charles Timm. Nichols imported Timm and the window glass from England. The house and springhouse took six years to build. Nichols and his wife were outspoken abolitionists and the house served as a haven for runaway slaves.  


  From time to time, Wolf Pen Springs was abandoned and fell into disrepair. As Buchwald observed on our 90th anniversary hike, "It has consumed three fortunes."  


  Another hiker that day, Dennis Tuttle, described his first trek to Wolf Pen Springs in the early 1980s.  


  "The first time I went on that hike, it had not been lived in for quite a few years and sheep were running through the house," Tuttle said. "The inside was pretty well trashed but the magnificent stonework was still in mint condition."  


  Among those who restored the house over the years was Mary Staats, who died in 1994. Tuttle recalled that, on one hike to Wolf Pen Springs, Staats invited Sub Alpine members to come inside.  


  "Mary invited all of the hikers to the basement where she showed us pictures of the glory days, where the runaway slaves would stop for food and water while on the underground railroad," Tuttle said.  


  On the Feb. 15 hike, I had the opportunity to speak with Wolf Pen Springs' current owner, who has gone to great lengths to refurbish it. He asked that I not publish his name. One of my shortcomings as a journalist has been my respect for people's privacy, so I'll honor his request.  


  He described the project not as a restoration but a "repurposing." (Few mortals could afford to undertake a full historical restoration.) It was a huge undertaking that required stripping the house down to a sandstone shell. The result is a hybrid of form and function. The exterior has been restored to its former glory while the interior serves as a residence.  


  We can all be grateful to the current and past owners for resurrecting Wolf Pen Springs. This "fairy castle in the woods" will forever hold a special place in the hearts of Sub Alpine Club members, those who lived and toiled there, descendants of the slaves it sheltered, and all who value history.

COVID-19 has started stealing the sheen off marriages and other ceremonies in Pathanamthitta, Kerala, a district otherwise known for its pompous weddings and ceremonial festivals.
 Vishnu Panackal, an employee of Pathanamthitta Service Cooperative Bank, tied the knot with Parvathy, a paddy analyst attached to the Civil Supplies Corporation, at a simple function held at the Muringamangalam Mahadevar temple at Konni on Thursday. The families had invited 2,000 people well in advance. A well-known catering group was in charge of the feast.
 Then came the COVID-19 threat, shattering all their plans and dreams. Pathanamthitta hit the headlines, with Ranni becoming the epicentre of State’s second spell of COVID-19 infection on March 7. The government imposed restrictions on people’s movement and on public and private functions.
 Parents of Vishnu and Parvathy advertised in regional newspapers informing invitees of the decision to cancel the ceremonial part of the wedding.
 Hardly 50 persons, family members and close relatives, turned up for the wedding. All of them were given face masks. Sanitiser too was available to clean their hands. Tying the knot was held without any fanfare.

Because of COVID-19, Rambler's Rest — along with most other communities — has shut down gatherings and recreation halls. That left, as of Thursday morning, the beaches as a place to go outside and get fresh air.


  "We decided to come out here to the open air; they said open air is best," Tom Forshee, 70, said. "Anybody gets close to us, we'll just pack up and leave. That's why we've got this line right here...We're doing that six-foot, don't crowd up," he added — pointing to the markings in the sand.


  The four come down to Venice Beach about once a week but said Thursday didn't seem crowded at all, chalking it up — at least in part — to winter residents returning north early because of COVID-19.


  "A lot of people in the park have already left," Margaret Tuohy said.


  "They closed all the activities out," Tom Forshee said.


  "But what's the use of going home? It's the same thing up there," Jane Forshee said.


  The four said they are very aware of the illness and are protective because two of the four have health issues that make them weaker to COVID-19.


  "We have to watch what we're doing," Jane Forshee said.


  But it's not something to panic about, they said, putting part of the onus on media.


  "I think the media plays it up too much. If you sit there and listen to the media too much, it drives you crazy. A little bit is fine, but they go overboard and it's all negative. There's no positive,"


  Margaret Tuohy said. "You can't become so isolated that you can't go out of your house."


  None of them, though, were upset at the idea that the city might close Venice Beach.


  "If it closes, it closes," Tom Forshee said.


  Harold and Donna Carlson were hosting their family from the Port Huron area of Michigan who were down for spring break. Their group, likewise, had a circle around their family encampment.


  "We're concerned but not worried ... yet," Harold Carlson said.


  He and his wife live in the winter months in Bird Bay in Venice.


  "We try not to watch too much TV," Harold Carlson said.


  His wife, Donna, was hopeful that people would use common sense and allow the area to remain one of few places people could visit.


  "I don't think it's a place that has to close if people keep a distance," Donna Carlson said.

And, even in-state, that wasn’t the case for everybody else.


  “For a school like Washington, they were able to get on the road in January and they could start looking ahead to 2021,” Huffman said. “They could go to all the schools that their 2021 targets were at and be seen. Whereas at Washington State, (new head coach Nick) Rolovich was just trying to put the final touches on that class and going out and doing in-homes with guys who were on the fence.


  “Washington had an advantage, and it was a self-imposed advantage that they had, because they were able to sign their entire class (early). There are so many schools that, for whatever reason, spring was going to have to be their primary time to get out and see kids. Now they’ve (likely) lost that time.”


  Though, it shouldn’t be assumed that the spring evaluation period will be entirely eliminated. It will more likely bleed into the otherwise unoccupied summer months.


  “There may not be a dead period in the summer now like there has been in July the last couple years,” Huffman said. “You may just see the evaluation period go straight from let’s say, realistically, late April or early May all the way through fall camp. Now, maybe they close it for a couple weeks in August and leave it open the whole month of July so that coaches aren’t having to do recruiting during fall practice. But I bet you’re going to see a lot more schools that had to give up when they wanted to have kids on campus in the spring now try to do some kind of recruiting event in August, if they have a fall scrimmage or anything else going on.


  “So it’s really forcing schools to adjust their calendars, whether they were prepared for this or not.”


  Take Washington, for example. The Huskies’ spring game is currently set for April 25, and it’s likely the intention was to use it as the centerpiece for a significant recruiting visit weekend. If said spring game is canceled — and it almost certainly will be — Lake and Co. could potentially replace it with a separate recruiting event this summer.


  This all comes, by the way, during an unprecedented recruiting cycle in the state of Washington, which touts three five-star prospects — Eastside Catholic defensive tackle J.T. Tuimoloau, Steilacoom wide receiver Emeka Egbuka and Kennedy Catholic quarterback and UW commit Sam Huard — as well as seven more four-star recruits, according to the 247Sports Composite.


  Huffman said this week that the December early signing day will likely be unaffected by any recruiting calendar alterations. Coaches will still recruit, recruits will still sign and the cycle will continue unabated. It will just require a different path to arrive at the same place.


  “Will players have the camps to get a chance to be seen by these coaches (in the spring evaluation period)? Are guys that wanted to make early decisions going to be able to make them now, without the ability to take official visits in the spring? It’s just such mayhem,” Huffman said.


  “With no spring football, I think a lot of these coaches would love to be on the road right now. But they can’t even have kids on campus.”

Hailing the Supreme Court order directing the Congress-led Madhya Pradesh government to take the floor test on Friday, BJP vice president and former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan exuded confidence that the government would face defeat, paving the way for a new regime.
 “Satyamev Jayate! Truth has prevailed today, injustice has been defeated,” Mr. Chouhan told reporters. “People’s anger is taking the Kamal Nath government down. Our MLAs have to take up a big responsibility now. The BJP bastion is strong.”
 Confident that the BJP had the numbers, the former CM said, “It will be proven on Friday that this government is in minority. Terrorism, pressure tactics, allurements and threats, Mr. Nath and especially Digivjaya Singh have been on them. Today, they have been defeated”.
 Law Minister P.C. Sharma, however, expressed confidence the government would survive. “It will be a victory for the Kamal Nath government by all means. More hands will be raised for us in the Assembly,” he asserted.
 Stating that the 16 rebel Congress MLAs in Bengaluru, who have reportedly pledged loyalty to the erstwhile Congressman turned BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, “must be heard”, Mr. Sharma said the Congress would take suggestions from lawyers representing it on the further legal recourse.
 The embattled government is shored up by 92 Congress MLAs in Bhopal, while four independents, two BSP members and the lone SP MLA have backed it in the past. Even as the party tried desperately to woo back the 22 MLAs, who are currently in Bengaluru, the rebel members sent in their resignation letters through BJP leaders. The Speaker has so far accepted the resignations of six members. all of whom were ministers in the government.
 In the wake of these six resignations and the earlier deaths of two members, the effective strength of the 230-member House now stands at 222. And Mr. Nath, Chief Minister for 15 months now, will have to secure the trust of at least 112 members, failing which the government will fall. The BJP, which remained in power for 15 years previously, has 107 members in the Assembly.
 On whether the rebels would return to vote, Mr. Chouhan said, “It is for them to decide.” Revenue Minister Jitu Patwari, on the other hand, said it was crucial for the rebels to return and participate in the vote. “If they don’t, it will be considered a murder of democracy. How will they face their voters after that? To protect democracy, they have to be here.” The Congress has contended that the MLAs had been held hostage in BJP-ruled Karnataka, where several attempts by Congressmen to reach out to them had been foiled by the State police. The rebels, in several videos on social media, have ostensibly voiced their protest against the Congress government and said that they didn’t want to be approached by the party’s leaders. However, all but one are said to be undecided on joining the BJP.
 Priyavrat Singh, Energy Minister, contended that in politics, all possibilities must be considered until the last minute. “The test needs to be conducted by 5 p.m. on Friday. Even for those 16 MLAs, possibilities are open until then.”
 On Monday, when the Speaker had adjourned the Assembly to March 26 in view of the coronavirus threat, the BJP had paraded 106 of its MLAs at the Raj Bhavan to show the Governor that it had the numbers. “We have already shown our numbers. Where is the doubt?” asked Narottam Mishra, Chief Whip for the BJP in the Assembly. “The Congress has been constantly running away from the test. The disease was just an excuse to put it off.”
 BJP State president V.D. Sharma said the court order reflected the decision of 7.5 crore people of the State, which the Congress “had been deceiving” all the while. “This is a win for the poor. The court has heard the cry of every BJP worker, harassed by the Congress government.”
 An atmosphere of distrust had prevailed among the State’s people, said Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava. “The order has set a precedent. In any case, no member is ignored in the BJP, as in the Congress,” he added.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Nath posted on Twitter: “We will study the Supreme Court’s order and its every aspect, hold discussions with our legal experts, take advice, and based on that take a decision.”

Though people will not be allowed to enter the store, Lietz said the “anyone who’s in need of food” will be served during this period, as opposed to only food club members.


  “People will be able to call or fill out a form on our website, letting us know who they are, how many in their family … and we’re going to be handing out boxes of food for as long as we can to as many people as we can,” Lietz said. “We are here to serve people who need food. We ask folks to please come if they need it, and if they don’t, that they leave it for people who do.”


  Lietz said the decision to close the food club came as a result of collaborative discussions between board members and staff, as well as the response to the coronavirus outbreak both locally and nationally.


  “We’ve seen the seriousness of this ramp up, and our goal is to limit the transmission of the virus in any way we can,” Lietz said. “We’re trying to be proactive and come up with a solution that’s the best good for the most people.


  “We don’t want to incite any panic or anything like that, but we are taking the situation very seriously, and many of our members and volunteers are at- risk, and we’re asking them to stay away.”


  Lietz said that the food club was already limiting the number of people allowed in the building to comply with mandates and recommendations for enclosed spaces, but she stressed that, given the rapidly changing nature of the situation, it was best to increase the level of caution.


  “Since Monday, we have been allowing only three households to shop at a time, but things are changing so quickly that our thought is that we should go to the safest possible model now,” she said.


  Lakeshore Food Club Executive Director O’Nealya Gronstal stated in a press release on Wednesday that the plan is to return to the grocery store model as soon as possible, but for the time being, the pick-up food distribution makes the most sense.


  For current food club members, all unused monthly points active as of March 18 will be rolled over for a 30-day period once the food club is back to operating in its normal capacity.


  “Boxes will be prepared according to household sizes and filled with a pre- selected variety of items. There will be an option for limited add-ons such as baby items, toiletries packs and cleaning items as long as supplies remain available,” Gronstal stated.

I mean, none of my movies are improvised films. There's just a process where we rehearse a lot, we shape the script, we try to get alternate lines based on things people have come up with in rehearsal, and we might relax a scene for a little while and let people play. And then hopefully when you get into editing you have choices. There's nothing worse than, at a test screening, having a moment not work or a joke bomb and having no other material to fix it. We're always looking for some variation on the material. But every once in a while someone will improvise something that's better than anything else in the movie. Often the best moment is something that just happened because the actors and actresses are feeling loose and trusted, and they're really present in the scene.

Amy Jenkins, a DARPA program manager, said in an interview with IEEE Spectrum that, right now, P3 has "one shot on goal … we're really hoping it works."


  DARPA's firebreak project proposes to shorten the lengthy vaccine process by taking a blood sample from a survivor, screening it to find all the antibodies the person's body has made to fight off the virus, choosing the most effective one, mapping its genetic code and then manufacturing it and injecting it into people. The first human trial began this week.


  This would leapfrog the development of vaccines, which are in the works, but will likely take more than a year to create. It would also skip the time- consuming step of manufacturing antibodies in bioreactors for injection. Instead, doctors would inject the genetic antibody material directly into humans, so that their bodies could produce their own antibodies. If effective, the protection would kick in within six to 24 hours.


  DARPA has been working for years on such immunotherapy treatments involving other diseases. The Pentagon is involved with pandemic strategies as a matter of national security, public safety and in order to develop drugs to protect front-line personnel, from soldiers to medical personnel, first responders, scientists and other vulnerable caregivers.


  Hopefully, the firebreak, which isn't permanent, will last up to six months. Vaccines, on the other hand, permanently address the problem by injecting people with a safe form of the pathogen, so that their bodies can safely have an opportunity to learn how to respond. This takes many months to formulate and manufacture, and immunity doesn't kick in for a couple of weeks after the injection.


  Firebreak protection, on the other hand, is temporary because these bits of genetic code are only "messenger RNA," or "mRNA," which carry instructions for antibody production. Eventually, that mRNA degrades, along with the antibodies it has created. Presumably, additional doses could be given until a vaccine is in place.


  DARPA's research efforts include biotech company Moderna Inc., which made a "mRNA" drug last fall that protects against the chikungunya virus and "showed it can be done," said Jenkins.


  On March 16, Moderna began clinical trials in Seattle with its mRNA-based vaccine for the coronavirus on 45 people. What's unusual is that, because the virus has been deemed a pandemic, the requirement to first test the substance on primates has been waived. But since the therapy doesn't contain the disease, there's no danger that the humans who are injected with it will get COVID-19. A similar vaccine was successfully tested on lab mice recently.


  The Americans, with a research war chest of tens of billions of dollars, have brought in the cavalry and will hopefully help save the day. Stay tuned for more breakthroughs from the world's scientific community.

Like countless other musicians, Parks is facing a world turned upside down. Little Big had been booked to perform this weekend at a jazz festival in Brazil, which has been canceled. The band's album-release celebration is scheduled for The Village Vanguard in mid-May, and it's unclear whether clubs in New York will be back in business by then. Parks is also a member of Terri Lyne Carrington's Social Science, whose cathartic Tiny Desk Concert rolled out earlier this month; they had been booked to appear at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, which was just rescheduled for the fall.

Not many houses look like the L.A. home of Pharrell Williams. The ultra- modern compound — covered in glass and perched on four acres with city-to- ocean views — hit the market recently for $16.95 million.


  The Beverly Hills-area estate is a world of its own, with koi ponds and waterfalls that dot the hilltop grounds that surround it. Almost every space, both indoor and outdoor, enjoys sweeping views below.


  If it sells, it will cap a two-year stay for Williams. The Grammy-winning artist paid $15.6 million for the estate in 2018 when he bought it from actor- filmmaker Tyler Perry.


  A 200-foot driveway approaches the mansion, which is fronted by a 30-car motor court. Custom-built in 1992, the dramatic abode has 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms in more than 17,000 square feet. Steel beams cut through expansive walls of glass across the exterior, creating a visually striking space that could serve well as a supervillain's lair. Inside, pyramid skylights and jagged lines continue the aesthetic.

Because the coronavirus has brought college athletic departments to a standstill, it might also prevent Liefke, Golenor and Cheney from visiting the schools in which they are interested in transferring.


  “The negative is on the girls’ side,” Hazeltine said of impact of the virus. “They need to see the campus and meet the team, and now I don’t know if that can happen.


  “It doesn’t fall negative on coaches because they have already seen the girls play and have expressed that they want them. But girls may have to make decisions without seeing the entire package.”


  For all five sophomores, the way the season was short circuited won’t soon be forgotten, if ever.


  “They are all extremely disappointed,” Hazeltine said of her sophomores. “We went over there with a 26-2 record and we were really playing well our last two or three games.


  “We all felt like we had a great shot at winning it all,” she said. “Now we will never know.”


  The finality of it all hit home last week when a number of the team’s players were on the court in the Dietrich Dome anticipating getting the chance to work out against new recruits who were making their campus visits.


  “We were supposed to have a couple of recruits in town because that is what we do in the spring after we we’re done,” Hazeltine said. “But the NWAC came down on recruiting and I had to call them and tell them they couldn’t come.


  “Our players were all dressed and ready to go, and I had to tell them to change and go home. They really didn’t want to because it really meant it was over.


  “They just wanted the chance to play against each one last time.”

I mean, none of my movies are improvised films. There’s just a process where we rehearse a lot, we shape the script, we try to get alternate lines based on things people have come up with in rehearsal, and we might relax a scene for a little while and let people play. And then hopefully when you get into editing you have choices. There’s nothing worse than, at a test screening, having a moment not work or a joke bomb and having no other material to fix it. We’re always looking for some variation on the material. But every once in a while someone will improvise something that’s better than anything else in the movie. Often the best moment is something that just happened because the actors and actresses are feeling loose and trusted, and they’re really present in the scene.

Love said in an earlier interview on Wednesday that Craske has helped him keep aspects of the coronavirus pandemic in perspective.


  She had a great saying yesterday that I hadn't heard and its social distancing doesn't mean social or self-isolation. I think during those times you can feel incredibly hopeless and I think that is at the root of all anxiety and depression first and foremost, Love said.


  "Obviously we have been distanced right now from pretty much everyone else to groups smaller than 10 people, so it's really, really important to be empathetic to that. Continue to tell people what you are going through, I know it's a very stressful anxiety-ridden time, like I said last night ... nothing unites us like the common enemy. I think if we can attack this together human beings can be extremely, extremely resilient and we will all get through it. But we need to stay connected and be together during throughout this time, I think that's going to allow people to be a lot healthier in the long run."
