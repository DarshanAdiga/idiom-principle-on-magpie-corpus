After crude oil made headlines worldwide last week for trading below zero, many investors began to wonder if other commodities could become worthless.
   
 To market historians, oil is not an aberration; many other markets have plunged below zero as well and serve as a warning that negative prices can come again.
   
 Rotten food prices
   
 As part of the coronavirus supply-chain disruptions, some dairy farmers are seeing demand collapse as processors are overwhelmed and unable to handle additional fresh milk supply. As cows continue to produce milk daily, farmers can be overrun with supply, forcing them to dump their milk on the ground, a sign that it has lost all value in the short run.
   
 Similarly, as slaughterhouses have closed or reduced capacity due to coronavirus outbreaks, poultry and hog farmers have nowhere to take animals and are culling the animals they cannot sell.
   
 One of the most famous examples of worthless commodities comes from 1956, when traders hoarded onions and then flooded the market with supply, driving prices for a 50-pound bag full of onions down to 10 cents per bag, less than the empty bag was worth.
   
 Energy markets zapped
   
 Energy markets have been prone to negative prices as well, as storing these products presents logistical issues.
   
 Oil and natural gas producers have seen effective negative prices when pipelines or storage is full. Additionally, electricity prices in California can go negative when nuclear power and renewable energy flood the market, driving prices so low that producers pay end users to use up excess supply.
   
 Get paid to borrow money?
   
 Negative interest rates, heretofore thought impossible, have become commonplace in Japan, Northern Europe and finally for short-term U.S. lending.
   
 This week, for example, the European Central Bank announced they would loan money to banks at a negative 1%, paying banks to borrow money. In turn, some banks are now lending at negative rates, paying consumers to take out a loan!

"No matter what the weather, she showed up," said Randy Mills, who was Benchoff's supervisor in the school system's Transportation Department.
 "She knew which students came every day. When they got off the bus, she knew each direction every student went," Mills said. If they started heading another way, Benchoff would yell after them that they needed to go home.
 "She was the boss of the corner" and feisty, Mills said.
 Even after the school system took over supervising crossing guards, Benchoff continued to wear her police crossing guard uniform that included a formal white hat and gloves and a long dark navy trench coat for when it rained, Mills said. It also included a whistle, which she used, he said.
 Rick Benchoff, 61, said his mom and dad, Dick, volunteered at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Martinsburg, W.Va., for hundreds of hours. They hosted parties for veterans, taking in bingo and giving veterans care packages, he said. His mother didn't go as often after his father, a World War II veteran, died in 1999.
 Mother and son were members of Ravens Roost 124. While his mom wasn't a football fan — she'd often ask what inning it was — she enjoyed the company and the food at the former Always Ron's restaurant where the fan club met, Rick Benchoff said. June loved going to the restaurant, where she would drink her Budweiser and play tip jar tickets.
 She also had been a fixture at the local Eagles and VFW clubs.
 Rick Benchoff remembers his mother as funny and blunt.
 She didn't have grandchildren, but she helped generations of families safely cross streets.
 "Her kids were her neighborhood kids," Rick said.

According to her son, she was the third COVID-19-related death in Washington County. While Sterling Senior Care officials confirmed Maryland Department of Health data that there was a COVID-positive resident who died at the Boonsboro facility, they would not confirm it was Benchoff. They did say it was a palliative-care resident.
 When the pandemic began, Rick Benchoff said, he told someone he doubted he would know anyone who would get the virus. Then it struck close to home when he discovered shortly after she had died that his mother had tested positive, he said. She had been at Sterling Care, her second long-term facility, because her dementia had progressed, he said.
 June Benchoff was born and raised in Hagerstown. Rick Benchoff said his parents moved to Baltimore Street in 1954 in part so his mother could walk to work. She didn't drive, but walked everywhere across the city.
 She applied at least twice with the Hagerstown Police Department to be a crossing guard, getting the job in 1957.
 "I had worked in stores, but I wanted to be outside," June told Herald-Mail Media in June 2011. "I knew some people who were crossing guards, and I thought this would be perfect for me." She said she loved her job.
 She was assigned to Antietam and Mulberry streets. But as the number of school-aged children in the neighborhood dwindled, she was moved to Locust and Washington where she continued until her retirement.
 The public school system eventually took over supervision of the crossing guards.

“When somebody’s the president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily news briefing. “And the governors know that.”
 “They can’t do anything without approval of the president of the United States,” Trump said.
 Blowback was swift and strong, from some legal scholars, who argued that a president does not have the authority to reverse state and local advisories and orders, but also from governors, some of whom had already begun making plans to reopen the economies in their states, which they had closed because Trump had said it was their job to do so.
 Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, led the resistance. “We don’t have King Trump, we have President Trump,” he said at his daily press briefing. In an interview on MSNBC Cuomo said, “If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it.”
 Trump seemed to revel in the conflict. “A good old-fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain,” he tweeted.
 A day later Trump walked back his rash proclamation of presidential omnipotence.
 In a news conference in the Rose Garden he said, “I will be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state in a time and a manner as most appropriate.”
 While maintaining his “total” power as president, Trump magnanimously gave the governors permission to do what some of them had insisted was within their power all along and what some of them were going to do anyway.
 Trump’s proclamation of executive power turned into a clear show of weakness. But make no mistake, it was a shrew tactical move. An NPR analyst said, the president “is now set up, politically, to take the credit if all goes well and to blame the governors if something goes wrong.”
 At one of Trump’s daily briefings a reporter said that someone had suggested a tickertape parade “when this is all over.” Not surprisingly, Trump said he liked the idea. You can bet he would relish leading the parade, once again following in front.

SPARTA -- The Board of Education has approved a $68.5 million budget that will raise the school portion of residents' taxes for the 2020-21 school year by 2.67%.
   
 The budget, which the board voted 8-1 to approve during a remotely held meeting Wednesday, was amended just prior to the vote to include the appropriation of an additional $200,000 for a proposed new playground at the Mohawk Avenue School, which the district's third-graders attend.
   
 The approved budget represents about a $500,000 reduction from last year's budgeted amount but will nonetheless raise the local tax levy by $545,000 over last year's amount, in part to make up for another state aid cut of at least $166,000 heading into the new school year as well as to pay for other programs and expenses.
   
 Among the included items are the addition of at least two new kindergarten aides at the Alpine Elementary School, which Superintendent Michael Rossi said could be increased to as many as six if needed to assist kindergartners with the wearing of face masks, gloves or other personal protective equipment that public health authorities could mandate prior to the reopening of schools in September as the coronavirus emergency winds down.
   
 Other plans call for purchasing district-wide security cameras, science materials, and a utility truck as well as leasing an additional school bus, and offering occupational and behavioral therapy services to the general student population. The district also will increase a special education teacher from half-time to full-time and add an instructional interventionist at the Helen Morgan School; add a health teacher at Sparta Middle School; and add a nurse and interscholastic sports in gymnastics and boys' volleyball and replace the auditorium sound system at Sparta High School.
   
 For the average township home currently assessed at $369,900, property taxes will increase by an estimated $149, according to Business Administrator Pamela Hinman.
   
 The overall tax increase calls for raising an additional $388,000 in so-called "banked cap" money in excess of the state's 2% cap on tax levy increases. The term "banked cap" refers to money the district could have taxed in the prior three years but didn't because it stayed under the cap.
   
 Immediately prior to holding Wednesday's budget hearing, the board swore in its newest member in the person of Mount Olive Schools Superintendent Robert Zywicki, a Sparta resident who was appointed temporarily to the seat left vacant by the April resignation of Karen Scott and who could choose to run in the fall for the remainder of her term, which expires at the end of 2021.
   
 Zywicki wasted no time wading into his first bit of controversy as he questioned Rossi about why architect Greg Somjen -- who informed the board Wednesday night that, because of drainage issues, the proposed Mohawk Avenue School playground could end up costing more than the estimated $200,000 -- was not consulted on the matter months earlier so the board could better prepare.
   
 "Budgeting usually begins in November," Zywicki said. "I've never seen a quote come through on the day of a public hearing for a capital project that was discussed and meetings were held on last fall. I would think the architect would have been engaged months ahead of time."
   
 Rossi acknowledged that the drainage issue came as a surprise to him as well but said he was hopeful the district would be able to get the playground done in the coming year.
   
 Board member Kate Matteson, however, ripped the administration over what she characterized as shoddy planning, both on the playground issue and in how the budget itself was presented. She also accused school officials of giving priority to last year's $3 million construction of a multi-purpose turf field at the high school at the expense of the district's elementary school students, whom she suggested were being given short shrift by comparison.
   
 Board members Kylen Anderson and Jason Ventresca disputed that, saying the turf field took five years of planning that included several false starts along the way. "I don't think it's fair to say that people were more concerned about the turf field than the playground," Anderson said.
   
 Matteson, however, noted that several of the district's schools sit smack in the middle of heavily regulated wetlands and said school officials should have factored this into their planning. "It's New Jersey. You have to do your homework. ... The third-grade playground was just as important as the turf field and should have been taken just as seriously. It's a real fail," she said.
   
 Matteson also faulted the school administration for not having a PowerPoint or other presentation on the budget available and said she would be voting against it for this reason. The other eight members all voted in favor of the budget's adoption.
   
 Prior to the final vote on the budget, Board Vice President Jennifer Grana made a motion to appropriate the additional $200,000 for the playground, a motion that board member Kurt Morris opposed but that the others all supported.

Doctors treating Boris Johnson for coronavirus prepared to announce his death after he was taken to intensive care, the British prime minister said on Sunday, in his first detailed comments about his illness.
 "It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it," he was quoted as saying by the Sun on Sunday newspaper in an interview. "They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin'-type scenario.
 "I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong."
 Johnson, 55, first announced he had contracted COVID-19 on March 27 but maintained he had only mild symptoms. Yet he failed to shake the illness after a week of self-isolation.
 He was taken to hospital as a precaution on April 5 for further tests but within 24 hours was moved to intensive care.
 The Conservative party leader spent three days receiving "oxygen support", and admitted after his discharge on April 12 that his fight with the virus "could have gone either way".
 But although he told the newspaper he did think "how am I going to get out of this?", he did not think at any point he was going to die.
 Johnson, who returned to work last Monday and became a father again when his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth on Wednesday, said he was given "litres and litres" of oxygen in hospital.
 He said he felt frustrated he was not getting better but the reality hit home when doctors were deliberating whether to intubate him and put him on a ventilator.
 "That was when it got a bit... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally," he told the weekly tabloid.
 \- 'Pretty groggy' -
 Johnson has repeatedly paid tribute to staff of the state-run National Health Service (NHS) for their care.
 He and Symonds' baby boy, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, is named in part after two of the doctors who led his care -- doctors Nick Price and Nick Hart.
 Both are experts in infectious diseases and ventilation.
 Symonds, 32, said in an Instagram post earlier to announce the boy's name that Hart and Price "saved Boris' life last month".
 The Sun on Sunday said Johnson was emotional when recalling his treatment and recovery, which he called "an extraordinary thing".
 He said he had been "in denial" about the seriousness of his condition at first, as he tried to continue to work despite feeling "pretty groggy".
 He also said he did not want to go to hospital at first but doctors were adamant because of his low oxygen levels. "Looking back, they were right to force me to go," he said.
 Johnson said the experience had made him more determined to fight the disease and get the country back to normal.
 His comments came as the government announced 621 more deaths in the outbreak, taking the overall cumulative toll to 28,131 -- just behind Europe's worst-hit country, Italy.
 He said he would announce a "roadmap" towards easing the lockdown restrictions imposed in late March later this week.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has underlined the need to inculcate the concept of ‘scientific social responsibility,’ akin to corporate social responsibility, to connect the leading institutions with all stakeholders, including schools and colleges.
 The idea is to create an environment for sharing of ideas and resources by providing opportunity to the brightest and best of brains in every corner of India to excel in science.
 “This will ensure that our youth get high-end training and exposure to the best of science and technology to make them job-ready in a competitive world”.
 Delivering the inaugural address at the 104th Indian Science Congress on Sri Venkateswara University campus here on Tuesday, on the theme ‘Science and Technology for national development’, Mr. Modi announced all form of support to the scientific and research organisations, and in turn, told scientists to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the fruits of science reached the marginalised sections of society.
 Pledging his government's support to building a strong S&T infrastructure that is accessible to academia, start-ups, industry and R&D labs, the Prime Minister sought to address the problems of ease of access, maintenance, redundancy and duplication of expensive equipments.
 In this connection, he mooted the idea of establishing professionally-managed centres in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode to house high-value scientific equipment. Mr. Modi exhorted national laboratories to establish a ‘connect’ with schools and colleges to develop appropriate training programmes.
 ##
 Hub and spoke model
 “Laboratories, research institutions and universities in each major city and region should be interlinked to function on a hub and spoke model. The hubs will share major infrastructure, drive our national science missions and be the engines that link discovery to application,” he said, while asking institutes to consider involving NRI Ph.D. students and outstanding scientists from abroad for long-term research association.

Many area small businesses who applied have been receiving or should be receiving federal help to get through the pandemic.
   
 For some, though, the hassle comes not from applying for funds but figuring out how best to apply them.
   
 Businesses could apply for funds through the Paycheck Protection Program, created weeks ago through the CARES Act, from a lender approved by the Small Business Administration, or through an Economic Injury Disaster Loan directly from the SBA, but not both. PPP ran out of money quickly, but Congress has approved more to replenish it.
   
 Tom Waters, owner of Corporate Copy Center on the Independence Square, said he laid off 10 of 12 staff members in mid-March and recently received his PPP funds.
   
 "It was a fairly simple process; it went fairly quick," Waters said. "The bad news was we found it difficult to understand rules of who to apply it to and how you could apply it. I don't want to pull people off unemployment if there's not work to do."
   
 "It's been interesting and difficult to make decisions. I'm thankful to have a program that provides a forgiveness option if you follow certain directions, so don't end up with a ton of debt."
   
 "My bank, before anything was officially released, they did a really good job of keeping me in the loop of what they knew, and I was able to get my documents once it was official," said Matt Medley, who co-owns 3 Trails Brewery and whose wife has a small dental practice. "We submitted it that first day we could."
   
 Both businesses received PPP funds. Medley said he's been able to bring employees in for some hours, as 3 Trails can sell to-go beers, while his wife's practice laid off most of the staff but is having them do continuing education.
   
 Jeff Siems, owner of Blue Springs Marine, said he submitted his PPP application shortly after those opened and received his funds within a week.
   
 "I was surprised how quickly it turned around," Siems said. "The only thing was we cut people's hours back briefly as we gauged the impact" of the pandemic.
   
 Siems said his service team was able to stay open, and his sales team shifted to online sales and tutorials and had their most successful April in sales.
   
 "We actually sold a few boats from never seeing the customer face-to-face; I never thought that would happen," he said.
   
 One thing Siems said he and other businesses he works with experienced is that more local banks had better initial success than national ones in obtaining federal help, which could be good for small businesses.
   
 "It seems like smaller, regional banks had better luck," he said. "They have better client relationships. That's where that local relationship helps."
   
 While his business has stayed well through the pandemic, he can understand the quandary some others face with applying their federal help and bringing people back off unemployment.
   
 "If you're a business that truly had to shut down, that's a real balancing act," he said.
   
 Tom Lesnak, president of the Independence Chamber of Commerce, said his feedback thus far has been that businesses have either received funds or know they are in the pipeline to receive funds with the next round of federal stimulus.
   
 "I've not heard reports of being turned down or not being able to get in," Lesnak said. "Some have decided not to apply, and that's their own position.
   
 "Most of our members have good relationships with local bankers, and some bankers have been taking in new customers after helping out current customers."
   
 Lara Vermillion, president of the Blue Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the SBA website crashed from short-staffing early on, but she's heard of both PPP and EIDL loans being distributed.
   
 Similar to Lesnak, Vermillion said, "I feel like our role has been to get businesses the most accurate information as quickly as we can, like with county orders and the various aids. People have had lots of questions."
   
 "We have about 500 members, and we've been responding to a lot of questions from non-members," Lesnak said.
   
 Both chamber presidents said that no matter how or when restrictions start to ease, that won't happen quickly, and business should by now have learned how to be cautious for themselves and customers. Ultimately, consumer confidence will drive an economic bounce back.
   
 "Businesses don't want to be liable" for somebody getting sick, Lesnak said. "They'll be the cleanest they've ever been."
   
 "As we open up, I think it will be a week-by-week experiment."
   
 "I think most realize that," Vermillion said in agreement. "It's nice in a Pollyanna world to think about turning a switch, but it will be more turning the dial. I don't think anybody wants to go back into a quarantine stage."
   
 Waters said reopening most certainly doesn't mean a return to March 11, the last day before pandemic restrictions.
   
 "We're conscious of everyone's health involved - employees, customers, vendors," Waters said. "There's a sense in the air that people are ready to get back in some way. But we've already put signs up that request social distancing, removed the self-service copier. At the end of the day it's changing the way we do business."
   
 "We were blessed that we were financially strong going in, but we won't be the same."

Doctors treating Boris Johnson for coronavirus prepared to announce his death after he was taken to intensive care, the British prime minister said on Sunday, in his first detailed comments about his illness.
 "It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it," he was quoted as saying by the Sun on Sunday newspaper in an interview. "They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin'-type scenario.
 "I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong."
 Johnson, 55, first announced he had contracted COVID-19 on March 27 but maintained he had only mild symptoms. Yet he failed to shake the illness after a week of self-isolation.
 He was taken to hospital as a precaution on April 5 for further tests but within 24 hours was moved to intensive care.
 The Conservative party leader spent three days receiving "oxygen support", and admitted after his discharge on April 12 that his fight with the virus "could have gone either way".
 But although he told the newspaper he did think "how am I going to get out of this?", he did not think at any point he was going to die.
 Johnson, who returned to work last Monday and became a father again when his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth on Wednesday, said he was given "litres and litres" of oxygen in hospital.
 He said he felt frustrated he was not getting better but the reality hit home when doctors were deliberating whether to intubate him and put him on a ventilator.
 "That was when it got a bit... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally," he told the weekly tabloid.
 \- 'Pretty groggy' -
 Johnson has repeatedly paid tribute to staff of the state-run National Health Service (NHS) for their care.

It’s also telling that the creators sought out performers like Smoove, Sykes, Knight and Alexander given much of the show’s runtime is spent on the comic incongruity of seeing iconic supervillains and heroes engaging in daily mundanities and a number of absurd scenarios, much like “Curb” or “Seinfeld”’s mundane scenarios that spiral into bizarre chaos.

The calendar has now turned to May, and we're closing in on two months since the NBA last played a game. As time drags on, the future of the 2019-20 season is still up in the air, and there are major hurdles the league still needs to clear in order to return to action.
 With the coronavirus pandemic still wreaking havoc on the country, the league seems to have focused its attention on creating a bubble environment that would effectively quarantine teams in one location until the season could be completed. They were offered an entire block on the Las Vegas strip, according to a report from The New York Times, and have also looked into the possibility of taking over Disney World, per The Athletic.
 Something along those lines seems like the only way forward if the NBA is determined to crown a champion for 2020, but even those plans don't come without plenty of challenges. As some GMs have noted, there are concerns about safety for older coaches and staff members, debates about who would be allowed into the bubble and on top of that the league will need access to thousands of tests.
 In regards to those last two issues, Brian Windhorst of ESPN offered some important details that shed light on the league's plans. He reported that creating a bubble that excludes family members is not on the table right now, and added that the league may need up to 100,000 tests to maintain a safe environment.

 When a mom and dad packed the children into the two-seater carriage for an outing in the horse and buggy days, the family dog often got in front and with great enthusiasm led the coach down the driveway. But when the carriage got to the street, the dog was faced with a dilemma: Will the coach turn right or left? If it guessed wrong — if the dog went right and the buggy went left, for example — the dog would have to hurry past the buggy to get back in front.

Warley has close ties to Michigan assistant Phil Martelli and received an offer within the last week. U-M should have a great shot here after a virtual visit that went well.
 "I hadn't seen [Howard] face to face before. I had chatted over the phone a couple times with him, but it was good just to be able to see him visually, put faces with names, see the campus," Warley said.
 Warley has long said a trustworthy coaching staff, a challenging schedule, a welcoming school community and a challenging academic environment would be high on his list of priorities, and U-M fits the bill.
 It doesn't hurt, either, that his father and uncle both played with Martelli at St. Joseph, while his uncle coached with him there, as well.
 "Most of what I heard about him wasn't even related to basketball, but the kind of guy he is," Warley praised. "My uncle said that was why he coached because with him; he knows what type of guy he is."

“This could provide a connection and inspire people to reflect on this time,” said Jenny Cole, the library’s teen services librarian. “Hopefully it will let future generations ... look back at this moment in history.”
 Library Director Sarah Ward said the idea came from several sources, including an art project Cole launched and a similar memory-preserving project by the Columbia County Rural Library District in Dayton.
 She said her hope is that residents won’t hesitate to submit memories about this time, even if they don’t initially seem exciting.
 “My hope is people will submit thoughts about the pandemic, about the small ways life has changed,” Ward said. “Everyone’s baking sourdough, people are talking about their first gardens, my friends with kids in school are laughing about how hard third-grade homework is.
 “People are reflecting on cooking more, baking bread, doing things they haven’t done before. They’re small but impactful. There will be an after ... (at that time) will we all be baking bread or will that be the thing we did during the pandemic?”
 Cole said she hopes younger people will consider submitting memories about how their lives are different.
 “People don’t need to worry about making it perfect or writing the great American novel. It’s more about how it’s changed people’s lives, some of the negatives, some of the positives,” she said.
 The submissions can include photographs, poems, artwork or other creative memories. Details on how the memories will be archived and made accessible will be determined later.
 The submission portal for the memories is on the same page where the library has posted other COVID-19 resources, including health and wellness information, educational resources and a map of Wi-Fi hot spots.
