China too, is introducing renewed restrictions after two cities reported new cases of the virus. Shulan, in Jilin province in the country's far northeast, has been put under lockdown, following 11 newly confirmed cases. Jilin borders both Russia and North Korea, and concerns have previously been raised over imported cases from overseas causing a renewed outbreak.


  More alarming are the new cluster of infections in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where cases of the novel coronavirus were first detected late last year. Wuhan was the first city in the world to enter into lockdown, only returning to relative normality late last month after 76-days.


  On Monday, city officials said five new cases had been confirmed in the city, none of which were imported from overseas. While that is a far cry from the figures at the beginning of the crisis, or those being reported daily across much of western Europe and the United States right now, the apparent ability of the virus to continue spreading undetected -- especially in a city as intensely surveilled and restricted as Wuhan -- will lead to concerns about the viability of reopening.


  Mi Feng, spokesman for China's National Health Commission, on Sunday urged people to "stay alert and step up personal protection against the virus." He added that the new clusters were a reminder to avoid social gatherings and seek medical advice or testing should anyone exhibit virus symptoms.


  Before the latest cases, the number of new infections in both China and South Korea had slowed to a trickle, with local transmission appearing to be halted. While questions can be raised over the accuracy of China's numbers, or the certainty anyone can have that all cases have been detected and contained in a country so large, South Korea's response has been hailed as one of the best globally, aided in part by the country's relative small size and easily- controlled borders.

Madrid, May 11 (AFP) Barcelona football star Gerard Pique said he was "pessimistic" that the Davis Cup Finals, which his company finances, would be held in Madrid this year.
 Pique's Kosmos investment group has a 25-year deal worth $3 billion with the International Tennis Federation.
 However, he believes that the November 23-29 finals in the Spanish capital could fall victim to the coronavirus.
 "There is a lot of uncertainty, we try to be aware of what the government says regarding sports and to whether we can put spectators inside the Caja Magica," Pique told Movistar television.
 "I would say I am a bit pessimistic, because a Davis Cup without fans is difficult.
 "I think that nobody at the moment has the certainty that we can put fans in or if it will have to be behind closed doors. As the days go by, I suppose we will have a little more clarity."
 Spain, one of the worst-affected countries by the pandemic, started a four- phase plan last week to relax the strict confinement rules applied since mid- March.
 In the more advanced phases of the plan, a maximum of 400 people will be allowed to attend open-air events and just 50 if they are held indoors.
 Spain won the first edition of the new-look Davis Cup in 2019, beating Canada 2-0 in the final in Madrid.
 All professional tennis has been in cold storage since mid-March with Wimbledon cancelled for the first time since the Second World War and Roland Garros moved back to September and October.
 The ATP and WTA will not resume until July 13 at the earliest. (AFP)

"Listen, we have families, too," White told CNN Sport. "I have a family; I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to die. "This isn't just some crazy, this is a well thought-out plan. We've had very, very smart people, doctors and people that have been involved with the UFC for a very long time working on this thing non-stop since it started. "We believe that we have this thing in a place where it can be as safe as it can possibly be." White's controversial plans to stage a fight card in April on an Indian tribal reservation in California were thwarted. But he got the green light in Florida to hold bouts without spectators from Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jacksonville, headlined by an interim lightweight title bout between Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje. Both fighters made weight on Friday at a weigh-in where media members and most UFC staff were kept at a distance, those closer to the fighters wore masks and the scale was sanitized.

“So I would definitely advocate if anyone was going to put a program together to get their sport of their work back, is to utilize both different technologies,” he said.
 The University of Southern California also participated in the study.
 Bhattacharya said MLB employees are younger than the overall population and took protective measures such as frequent hand washing when they reported to spring training in early February, earlier than most people.
 No MLB employees have been known to have died from COVID-19.
 While the percentage of Los Angeles Angels employees with positive test was the highest among teams, the error margin is too high to draw results because just 123 tests were included from the team.
 Bhattacharya called the results “both good and bad news” because they showed the virus has not spread widely in MLB but still has many baseballers left to target. Eichner said results could mean MLB employees had been diligent in use of personal protective equipment, such as masks.
 “If this population was social isolating and practicing good PPE, then it shows that that worked and it didn’t get the spread in there,” Eichner said. “And then the flip side of that is that means it’s worked well, then they keep doing it.”
 Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and the figured was adjusted to about 42 to account for false positives and false negatives.
 Over 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities, according to Stanford medical student Bianca Mulaney, who authored the study.
 The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said. A pre-print server will publish the study this week, and it will be sent to a journal for peer review.
 Test kits were provided by the Partnership for Clean Competition, which funds anti-doping research, and researchers worked for free.
 Mulaney said the prevalence of positive tests for antibodies was higher in areas that have been harder hit by the virus, such as New York, and lower in less-impacted areas, such as Ohio.

She once told me that a newspaper should be a place where a person could go when he has exhausted all other options — the paper should be the recourse of last resort.
 The third thing I learned from her was a sense of fun.
 Yes, she regarded journalism as a high calling. But there is no sense in owning or producing a daily newspaper, she thought, if you don’t have some fun — afflicting the comfortable as well as comforting the afflicted. Every day.
 And we did have fun. We laughed a lot and rattled a lot of cages. And we regularly surprised people. And formed no permanent alliances. (We didn’t endorse in political races.)
 We took the work seriously but ourselves not so much. We had a feisty little newspaper. At one time, when such things were possible, the JI was the fastest growing paper in New England. The paper’s motto was: “We tell it like it is, somebody has to.”
 Betty set the tone and tenor. She was rightly called, in her JI obit, “the soul” of the paper. She drew the boundaries and let us all roam within. She never stopped being a fan of good journalism or good writing and she was lavish with praise when she thought any one of us reached the top. But occasionally she would intone, always with a wry smile, “remember, it’s my sandbox.”
 She relished being the underdog and she loved a good fight. She adored jazz and theater and she liked cocktails, and sentences, that packed a punch. Her wit was sharp and dry and her composure eclipsed the truth that she was actually tough as nails. But she was also, in every sense of the word — a word in unfortunate retreat these days — a lady.
 And when I say tough, I refer not only to things she endured in life — loss, pain, the ruthlessness of age — but a certain mental toughness about the world. She was an old-fashioned progressive, but there was nothing of what we would today call “woke” about her. Not one ounce of preciousness or virtue signaling. And when I think about her I wonder if we have lost all rigor, both in our profession and in our society. What would she think about an entire economy shut down; a whole society sheltering in place, ad infinitum?
 Maybe that it is good that we are starting to reopen America; good that we are starting to come out. Maybe she would say that risk is part of life and we take a risk every time we leave the house or turn the key in the car. And who wants to live in a society where you can’t shake hands or hug your kid or visit your aging mother or your newborn granddaughter? Life is risk. And either you risk or you live by fear.
 Elizabeth Ellis took risks. It seemed to me she was never afraid.

Our dad will be greatly missed and is survived by a loving family including his wife of thirty-one years, Barbara; his daughter Deborah Lynne Hocevar and her husband John; his daughter Shawn Rene Laitner and her husband Doug; his son Cara "Butch" Hataway and his wife Lee Anne; his daughter Sue Ann Payne and her husband Ray. He is also survived by eleven adoring grandchildren; John Hocevar, Sarah Jordan, Bradley Hocevar, Max, Alex and Hannah Laitner, Justin, Elise and Evan Hataway, Aimee and Brittany Scott and eight great- grandchildren; Grey, Poppy, Kenadi, Kaidence, Ryan, Samuel, Brayden and Kara. Cara Lee was born and raised in Kansas City, Kansas. He was baptized at First Baptist Church of Kansas City Kansas, the same church where his parents first met. "C.L." graduated from Wyandotte High School in Kansas City, Kansas with the class of 1951. He was a proud Bulldog who, decades later, looked forward to lunch dates with his old classmates. Cara married Marilyn Elise Holt on February 14, 1954 and together they had four children. Cara served in the Army during the Korean War. He was stationed in Heidelberg, Germany where Marilyn later joined him. It was in Heidelberg where their first daughter Debbie was born. Upon completion of duty from the Army, Cara returned home to Kansas City, Kansas and eventually joined his parents and brother Jim in the family business, "Hataway Electric Motor Service". On May 21, 1988 Cara married Barbara Jane Jaspersen in Dallas, Texas. They resided in the Kansas City area. Barbara was Cara's constant companion, friend and love. Together they shared travel, fun, family and now memories. If you met our father one-time, you were his friend for life. Even when he didn't see you for many years, he would remember your name and something important about you. Dad appreciated meeting new people and loved to interact with total strangers. In a restaurant a bar or anywhere in public he was always "running for mayor", saying hello and shaking hands. In conversations with a new friend it wasn't long before they realized they knew someone in common. This natural gift of connecting with people usually added to another one of his small world stories he loved to share with us. Growing up, our friends thought of him as "the cool dad". He was "young" (or so they thought), handsome, a sharp dresser, charming, friendly, funny and charismatic. To us, he was dad. He was a dad who tried his best to succeed and one who was always thinking of his children and hoped one day they would have a better life. Grandpa Cara loved all things sports, including anything Jayhawk, everything KC Chiefs, the PGA Tour and especially The Masters. Barbara certainly helped to fuel his enthusiasm, often scheduling dinner and family get-togethers around a sporting event. Of course, more than anything, Cara loved his family and his family loved him. Preceding Cara in death were his parents, "Pat" and Minnie and his brother James D. Hataway. A celebration of life service for Cara will be at a later date when the current restrictions are lifted. In the meantime, put on your favorite Jayhawk or Chiefs apparel and pour a glass of Famous Grouse on the rocks with a splash, in his memory. He would love it. Arrangement for cremation and internment are being made by Johnson County Funeral Chapel. The family will cherish your shared memory of Cara. Please go to https://www.johnsoncountychapel.com/

Unlike Joshua and Wilder, Fury remains undefeated as a professional after forcing the Bronze Bomber's corner to throw in the towel earlier this year.
 The only blemish on his record is a draw with Wilder back in December 2018.
 But Fury has recently labelled Wilder as a tougher opponent than Joshua despite never stepping foot inside the ring with the Brit.
 "One-hundred percent, Joshua's not dangerous, at all. He's like a big cuddly baby," Fury told ESPN.

Anita Gattine      Anita Gattine never backed down from a fight. Life tested her more often than most but she remained generous, funny and fiercely independent - many say feisty - through all of the hardest times, right until the end. In fact, her final words are not printable in a family newspaper.      Anita Wilhelm Gattine, formerly of Poughkeepsie, died April 28, 2020 at the Cedars Nursing Care Center in Portland, Maine.      Born November 16, 1940 in Poughkeepsie, Anita was the daughter of the late Raymond J. and Edna Kelly Wilhelm.      She loved her children with all her heart and her grandchildren even more. She developed deeply loyal friendships throughout her life. These relationships provided a constant source of joy and laughter as well as an anchor during life's challenges.      A bold personality with an equally bold wardrobe, her driving earned her the nickname "Anita Andretti." Her family and friends will never forget her infectious laugh and always tasteful jokes. She was a second mom to many of her kids' friends and always welcomed newcomers to her Crestwood Boulevard home. Anita loved animals and adored every dog and cat she welcomed into her home over the years.      Anita was a successful real estate broker in Dutchess County for nearly two decades before moving to Maine in 2007 to be closer to family.      Anita is survived by her children, Drew Gattine (Elizabeth) of Westbrook, Maine; Melissa Gattine (Andrew Baca) of Cumberland Center, Maine; and Steven Gattine (Melissa) of Trumansburg, New York; her 6 grandchildren, Jordan Gattine, Sabrina Gattine, Dakin Camp, Nathaniel Baca, Ellie Gattine and Duncan Gattine; and her brother, Gerry Wilhelm (Sandy) of Tucson, Arizona. She also leaves behind several nephews, nieces, godchildren and many friends.      In addition to her parents, Anita was predeceased by her husband, Philip Gattine, and her beloved daughter, Jennifer Gattine.      Anita's family would like to thank all of the staff at the Cedars for the wonderful care they gave her the last six years of her life.      A Service to celebrate Anita will be held in Poughkeepsie when we can all gather to laugh again. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to The Cedars of Portland, www.thecedarsportland.org/giving/donate-now.

May 21, 1945 - April 28, 2020 Terry Kennedy, a longtime resident of La Habra and Whittier, has passed away after a brief but intense battle with cancer. We will miss his love, dedication, strength, generosity, and wisdom. Truly one of a kind, Terry was a big man with a big heart that he opened to anyone that needed a hand, encouragement or compassion. If you were a friend, he nourished and honored that friendship. He was a man's man, a woman's favorite, a natural leader and one of the kindest fellows that you could meet. Terry was raised in Monrovia and graduated in the class of 1963 from La Salle High School in Pasadena. Terry enlisted and proudly served in the U. S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam era and he made their motto of Semper Fi his own. When he returned home, Terry started his career in construction and as a plumbing contractor; he went on to successfully build and run several companies in and around La Habra, Whittier and the Santa Fe Springs area. In 1997, he had the unique opportunity to be a construction manager for Disneyland's expansion of the California Adventure Park. He then branched into real estate with his wife and youngest daughter for several years and eventually focused on property management. Terry was known as being an honest and caring employer and inspired and trained many young men who enjoyed successful careers. He loved that aspect of his work. Terry was wholly invested in his family, his loving wife of 48 years, Pam, and daughters Debbie, Jennifer, and Christine, all whom he treasured and enjoyed to the fullest. His sons-in-law - Scott, Christopher, and Ted - were added bonuses to his life, each different and special to him. Of course, Terry's cherished granddaughter Meredith was the apple of his eye and a joy to his heart. Terry loved, honored and appreciated his sisters Kathleen (Don) and Valerie, brother Tom (Suzanne), sisters-in-law Kathy and Joyce, and many dear nieces, nephews and cousins. Terry's other passions brought more into his life. He loved motorcycling and the men and women he met through it. He traveled cross country to Washington, D.C. with fellow veterans and supporters on the Run For The Wall rides for many years, and made it, mostly by motorcycle, to all 50 states with various like-minded buddies. He was involved in two nonprofits that were near and dear to his heart: La Habra Meals on Wheels and The John Henry Foundation in Santa Ana, taking leadership roles in each for several years. He rediscovered his love of singing with a local men's a cappella group and then joined the Gloria Dei Choir at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in La Habra where he enjoyed friendship and inspiration from his talented fellow members. In addition, he was an active member of the Knights of Columbus, an Elk member, and supported many other community organizations. Terry will be deeply missed and lovingly remembered. Contributions in honor of Terry may be made to The John Henry Foundation or La Habra Meals on Wheels. A celebration of life will be held at a later date.

However, he believes that the Nov. 23-29 finals in the Spanish capital could fall victim to the coronavirus.
 "There is a lot of uncertainty, we try to be aware of what the government says regarding sports and to whether we can put spectators inside the Caja Magica," Pique told television broadcaster Movistar.
 "I would say I am a bit pessimistic, because a Davis Cup without fans is difficult.
 "I think that nobody at the moment has the certainty that we can put fans in or if it will have to be behind closed doors. As the days go by, I suppose we will have a little more clarity."
 Spain, one of the worst-affected countries by the pandemic, started a four- phase plan last week to relax the strict confinement rules applied since mid- March.
 In the more advanced phases of the plan, a maximum of 400 people will be allowed to attend open-air events and just 50 if they are held indoors.
 Spain won the first edition of the new-look Davis Cup in 2019, beating Canada 2-0 in the final in Madrid.
 All professional tennis has been in cold storage since mid-March with Wimbledon canceled for the first time since World War II and the French Open moved back to September and October.
 The ATP and WTA will not resume until July 13 at the earliest.

William Neenan called a police officer "an English bastard" after accusing him of "kneeing him in the bollocks".
 The 42-year-old demanded money from 66-year-old shopkeeper Ali Dahsam, at Anfield News, in Anfield Road.
 The Irishman claimed he was owed £200 by the victim's son, but Mr Dahsam said he had no idea what he was talking about.
 Neenan, of Holbeck Street, Anfield, flew into a rage, lent over the counter and tried to slap the terrified OAP in the face.
 In front of horrified customers, including children, he then pulled over a glass mobile phone display cabinet, which smashed.

GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - Mother’s Day deserves a parade, even if it weren’t forced by a pandemic.For families separated from loves ones at Memorial Driftwood Nursing Center in Gulfport, it’s a welcomed occasion.“After we’re having to do social distancing, to be able to do a parade to see in any way means the world to me,” said Lesa Kelly of Poplarville, who has her mother at Driftwood. “You can’t take them out to lunch. So, getting to do the parade, they all get to enjoy it.”Sharron Ventura drove in from Baton Rouge for the occasion.“Just being able to be here – haven’t been able to see her for two months - and just being a part of this and know that she’s here and they can just have something exciting for Mother’s Day," she said. "Just being a part of it is awesome, you know?”The only thing missing is the hugs. For now, smiles and waves will have to do.Employees joined family and friends to give the residents lining the route a little cheer.“I think this is certainly one of the most challenging times for nursing homes,” said Kyle Lewis, Memorial senior care director. “And our first and foremost priority is keeping our residents safe, but we also have a duty to make sure we are meeting their social needs, and it’s days like today that really do that. They get outside and really enjoy a beautiful day like today and see their loved ones and celebrate with them. So, it’s quite important to them.”This is one of many events designed to help the residents and their families.“We are very fortunate to have a great activities department here,” Lewis added. “And they’re really thinking outside the box, like tele-visits with family members. We’re fortunate to have actually three decks here so we encourage family members to come and social distance and just come and see their loved ones.”Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

If we look at dry facts, you get an average score across the board. Some problems in pretty much every aspect. Things work, but it's a bare minimum. The sweet momentum that was, back in 2017 or so, gone. Well, there you go. Hopefully, the results will improve over time, but I'm doubtful. I've not seen anything really cool or fresh in the Xfce desktop per se for a while now. Xubuntu could work for those looking for a very spartan XP-like experience.

_My Hero Academia_ is now embroiled in a major war between the heroes and the Paranormal Liberation Front, but the latest chapter really indicated a point where there's going to be no turning back now. After weeks of teasing just how much stronger Tomura Shigaraki was going to be as a result of Dr. Garaki and All For One's experiments, the latest chapter of the series teases that we'll finally see the results of this strength boost. Unfortunately for one new heroic addition to the series, Shigaraki's going to be on the warpath.
  _My Hero Academia_ 's war arc has shined a light on a few pro heroes that have not been seen in the series before as they broke their way through an army of elite Nomu into Dr. Garaki's laboratory, and one of the recent newbies was the laser eyed hero X-Less. Hopefully you didn't get too attached to this newbie as the series is potentially preparing for his death.
 After Present Mic went to attack Dr. Garaki directly, Chapter 270 of the series sees Mic ask X-Less to look after Shigaraki's body and clean up the aftermath. As X-Less started to grab Shigaraki, he noticed how some of the laboratory equipment was not destroyed in Mirko's big attack on Shigaraki's tank. During all of this, Shigaraki begins to wake up as a series of images flash through his mind.
 With massive reveals about Shigaraki's current power level also being shown during this flash of images, the end of the chapter sees Shigaraki awaken from his slumber. X-Less is still standing right next to him, so that means he'll most likely be the target of Shigaraki's new power. We're going to need a demonstration, and unfortunately X-Less has been forcibly volunteered for this against his will.
 Shigaraki waking up will definitely shift the war between the heroes and villains in a dangerous and violent new direction, and now it's just a matter of seeing just how many heroes will far in the coming chapters. But what do you think? Do you think X-Less will be the first pro hero to fall from Shigaraki's new power? Who else could it be if not for X-Less? Will someone come and save this newbie pro hero before that happens?

O asistentă medicală din Statele Unite a fost acuzată că a furat un card de credit care aparținea unui pacient care se afla pe moarte, ca urmare a infectării cu noul coronavirus. Femeia, în vârstă de 43 de ani, ar fi furat cardul de credit al unui pacient, cu trei zile înainte de a muri, transmite Mirror. Mai mult decât atât, fiica pacientului spune că asistenta ar fi folosit cardul pentru a cumpăra combustibil și alimente, în valoare de aproape 60 de dolari. Fiica bărbatului și-ar fi dat seama de furt, după ce a primit o înștiințare că tatăl său a plătit combustibilul cu cardul, deși în mod normal el plătea cash. De asemenea, el se afla în spital în stare gravă, în momentul efectuării plății. „Evident că știam că este un angajat din spital, din moment ce alte persoane nu au voie să intre. Vreau doar să știu de ce a profitat de starea tatălui meu pentru a face așa ceva. Vreau să știu cum s-ar simți ea dacă cineva i-ar face asta unei persoane dragi ei. Atunci când oamenii fac astfel de lucruri, nu cred că gândesc în acest fel”, a mai spus aceasta. În urma acestei întâmplări, poliția a demarat o anchetă pentru a afla cu exactitate ce s-a întâmplat.

“So I would definitely advocate if anyone was going to put a program together to get their sport of their work back, is to utilize both different technologies,” he said.
 The University of Southern California also participated in the study.
 Bhattacharya said MLB employees are younger than the overall population and took protective measures such as frequent hand washing when they reported to spring training in early February, earlier than most people.
 No MLB employees have been known to have died from COVID-19.
 While the percentage of Los Angeles Angels employees with positive test was the highest among teams, the error margin is too high to draw results because just 123 tests were included from the team.
 Bhattacharya called the results “both good and bad news” because they showed the virus has not spread widely in MLB but still has many baseballers left to target. Eichner said results could mean MLB employees had been diligent in use of personal protective equipment, such as masks.
 “If this population was social isolating and practicing good PPE, then it shows that that worked and it didn’t get the spread in there,” Eichner said. “And then the flip side of that is that means it’s worked well, then they keep doing it.”
 Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and the figured was adjusted to about 42 to account for false positives and false negatives.
 Over 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities, according to Stanford medical student Bianca Mulaney, who authored the study.
 The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said. A pre-print server will publish the study this week, and it will be sent to a journal for peer review.
 Test kits were provided by the Partnership for Clean Competition, which funds anti-doping research, and researchers worked for free.
 Mulaney said the prevalence of positive tests for antibodies was higher in areas that have been harder hit by the virus, such as New York, and lower in less-impacted areas, such as Ohio.

There was a time we imported beans even from Burkina Faso. Rice from Thailand, and from everywhere under the sun. Milk, tomato paste, palm oil, vegetable oil, even toothpick. Everything was imported. Today, we rank highest in Africa in rice cultivation and milling, with over seven million tonnes yearly. Jobs have been created in millions, and food sufficiency has almost been achieved.

Five weeks later, on April 21, she returned to her job developing colours for a cosmetics company, but with shortness of breath and aching muscles, she found herself unable to take even short walks. Another test confirmed that she was no longer infected. But 11 weeks after testing positive, on the same day that Italy first quarantined towns, she is still not back to normal.
 “It takes a long time,” said Colombi, 59, who lives in Truccazzano, outside the northern city of Milan. “I can’t get back into my natural rhythms.”
 Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by the pandemic — its intensive care units inundated and its elderly dying in droves before the tsunami reached Spain, France, the United States or Britain. And so Italy is also ahead in coming to grips with the long duration of the illness and the lasting consequences for some survivors.
 Many Italians have grown painfully familiar with the way the infection can hang on for weeks, the symptoms can linger for weeks more and full recovery can take longer still — if it ever arrives. Of the more than 218,000 people in Italy who have tested positive, more than 30,000 have died and the government lists more than 103,000 as recovered.
 The stubbornness of the virus and the length of the convalescence have become topics of conversation in northern Italy, where some of the longest-suffering Italians are finding themselves in physical and financial uncertainty, unable to shake sickness and fatigue and get back to work.
 Their experience may also be instructive to other nations struggling to get their economies moving again.
 “We have seen many cases in which people take a long, long time to recover,” said Alessandro Venturi, director of the San Matteo hospital in the Lombardy town of Pavia, adding that the discomfort often seems to last even longer for people with lighter symptoms.
 “It’s not the sickness that lasts for 60 days; it is the convalescence,” he said. “It’s a very long convalescence.”
 Most people who catch the virus have few symptoms or none, but some get very sick, most often with pneumonia. Any pneumonia damages the lungs, which can take months to heal, and doctors warn that the harm might not be completely reversible.
 Studies also point to kidney, heart, liver and neurological damage, often from secondary infections, and no one knows what the long-term prospects are for those patients.
 But even some of the infected who have avoided pneumonia describe a maddeningly persistent and unpredictable illness, with unexpected symptoms. Bones feel broken. The senses dull. Stomachs are constantly upset. There are good days and then bad days without apparent rhyme nor reason.
 The afflicted find the simplest tasks taxing. Testing is still mostly reserved for the hospitalised, and so people suffering less severe but stubborn symptoms are trailed by doubt about whether they have the virus.
 Dr Annalisa Malara, an intensive care physician in Codogno, southeast of Milan, who diagnosed Italy’s first case of the outbreak in February, said there was still no clear understanding of why the virus and its effects lingered so long.
 “Lack of energy and the sensation of broken bones” are common, she said, adding that fatigue often lingered “even after the more intense symptoms are gone.”
 In the north of Italy, the epicentre of the contagion in that country, a partial lifting of the lockdown this month has allowed more family and friends to compare notes on their experiences.
 “It never finishes,” said Martina Sorlini, a 29-year-old math and physics high school teacher who has been running a low-grade fever since the beginning of March.
 She said that the cough and sore throat eventually went away, and that after three weeks she got her sense of taste and smell back, and even found enough energy to run and tend vegetables in her garden.
 Then came stomach aches, fatigue and the return of fever. And it hasn’t left, making it extremely tiring to teach her online high school classes.
 “I was convinced that I was better. They don’t know what happened,” Sorlini said. “They are seeing everything for the first time too.”
 Some say the experience of the long-suffering, if not critically ill, deserves more attention.
 Edmondo Cirielli, a member of parliament with the right-wing Brotherhood of Italy party, has argued that the health ministry should pay more attention to cases like his.
 On the weekend of March 7, Cirielli ran a fever and suffered cold-like symptoms, and became convinced he had picked up the virus by touching an infected surface in the parliament chamber. He tested positive that week.
 Almost immediately, he said, his fever and cough faded, and he thought he would be fine. Then he had what he called a “small respiratory crisis” that put him in the hospital.
 But he had no pneumonia, so he went home to self-quarantine. There, he suffered debilitating fatigue, sore throat, diarrhea and intense pain at the base of his neck that made it impossible to concentrate.
 “One day I was fine, the next bad. There was no building to a peak and then coming back down. It was up and down for a month,” he said.
 Then things got stranger.
 After 40 days of feeling lousy, he tested negative for the virus, but his eyes still burned and bouts of diarrhoea continued, he said.
 At the end of last month, he finally felt better, but another test result came back positive, forcing him to spend weeks more in isolation, where he kept busy watching “Versailles” on Netflix.
 Testing has been imperfect, and not everyone has access to it.
 Ingrid Magni, 44, got fever and chills March 21.
 “It never left me,” she said, adding that she started suffering intense headaches after about three weeks.
 Doctors could only recommend over-the-counter painkillers and bed rest. She got winded just making her bed.
 “I had to sit down,” she said. “I was too tired.”
 Without the eligibility to receive a swab test, which is usually reserved for hospital patients, she told her boss at a chemical plant that she would get an antibody test, which could be used to trigger an official swab test for the virus itself if antibodies are detected.
 But the results have not come back. She is eager to get back to work by the middle of the month and is not sure how many more sick days the doctor will sign off on.
 Others just want to feel better.
 Albertina Bonetti, 77, from Trescore Balneario, near Bergamo, developed nausea and fever March 7, followed by dry heaves and diarrhoea. After 10 days of fever, her legs began hurting so much that she could not put her feet on the ground.
 She needed an oxygen tank from March 20 to the end of April, but when she went to a hospital, the staff refused to admit her — so she, too, remained untested.
 Bonetti said that she still had shortness of breath and fatigue and that her senses remained out of whack. She misses normal life and the taste of her latte in the morning.
 “It leaves something inside you,” she said of the virus. “And you never go back the way you were before.”

MONTGOMERY -- Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Thursday criticized legislators for taking control of the state's coronavirus relief money and threatened to delay a needed special session until they disclose their plans "down to the penny."
   
 Ivey issued a tersely worded statement about the relief money that has become a subject of disagreement between the Republican governor and Republican- controlled Alabama Legislature. The governor issued the statement before lawmakers voted on budget bills. Lawmakers have indicated they want a say in how the state's roughly $1.7 billion from the coronavirus rescue package is spent.
   
 "I have never desired to control a single penny of this money and if the Legislature feels so strongly that they should have that authority, I yield to them both the money and the responsibility to make good decisions - in the light of day where the people of Alabama know what is happening," Ivey said.
   
 There is little the governor can do to block the legislature from taking budgeting control. But, exercising the leverage she does have, Ivey issued a public challenge to lawmakers to spend it wisely and said she will hold off on a needed special session until they disclose those spending plans.
   
 "The Constitution clearly states that the Legislature has the right to appropriate funds," Rep. Steve Clouse, the chairman of the House budget committee, told lawmakers on the House floor.
   
 House members on Thursday voted to put $200 million of the money in the executive branch to pay for medical expenses related to the state's COVID-19 response.
   
 Ivey said she told Clouse she will not call lawmakers back into special session until there is a public list of "how the money will be spent in exact amounts, down to the penny." The governor suggested in her public statement that lawmakers were considering unrelated expenses. She said she had seen "one 'wish list' that includes a new $200 million statehouse for the Legislature."
   
 Ivey said the money belongs to the people of Alabama.
   
 "It comes to us in an emergency appropriation from President Trump and Congress to support the ongoing crisis that has killed 349 Alabamians, as of this moment, and wreaked havoc on our state's economy, ruining small businesses and costing more than 430,000 Alabamians a job they had just a few weeks ago," Ivey said.

"Let's get back to some semblance of normal, whatever that is going to be and let's just worship Jesus and mom at the same time," said Pastor Mike Davis of Reedeming Grace Fellowship.
 Davis and the entire church wanted to do something for Mother's Day that gave parishioners a chance to get out of the house.
 "What I've maintained all along is you do what you feel safe and comfortable for you to do," said Davis. "There's no pressure on anybody."
 The staff at Rose Trail Nursing and Rehab in Tyler brought their residents outside and their families drove by wishing them all a happy Mother's Day.
 "We thought it would be a good opportunity to let our residents see their family members," said Administer Keith Koealer. "A lot of them with the Coronavirus going on having able to see him other than through FaceTime or talking to them through a window or through a glass door."
 Koealer says the pandemic and subsequent lockdown has been a difficult experience for many of the residents because they are separated from their families. However, the parade gave the residents a chance to celebrate and smile.
 "They're really glad that we planed this and I know their families are really excited, probably more than even the residents because they're the ones that really wanted to see them and thought this was awesome," said Koealer.

 Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.


--DocBreak--
Five years ago, Volkswagen was slamming the left lane at 80 miles per hour and getting 45 miles per gallon doing it. Drivers couldn't believe the performance they were enjoying from turbo-diesel engines in their Passats, Jettas, and Golfs.
   
 It was too good to be true.
   
 The world's largest automaker had installed defeat devices on its vehicles that prevented the EPA from detecting its cars were polluting up to 40 times the legal limit. Volkswagen's reputation took a hit as it spent over $20 billion to settle claims, but redemption may have come as the automaker ditches dirty diesel for a nostalgia-infused electric future.
   
 "Volkswagen clearly had to change its business strategy," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds. "They had to shut the door on diesel; even if new vehicles were fixed, people would be dubious of it. And, cars would be less desirable if they were not gaming the system _ had to go completely clean, in the opposite direction. Putting resources in the EV bucket is a positive for them, but it's more difficult to stand out in that category. Diesel gave them a unique edge."
   
 Volkswagen kicks off its modern EV initiative in the U.S. later this year with a Tiguan-sized crossover called the ID.4. Targeted at the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E, the ID.4 promises 300 horsepower, all-wheel-drive, and 310 miles of range. It is one of 15 EVs that Volkswagen plans to launch by 2025 in route to 40% electric sales by 2030. Expect the ID.4 to start at under $40,000.
   
 "We think it provides a remarkable combination of affordability, low cost of ownership, range, design, connectivity and technology, aimed right at the hottest segment in the U.S. market," said Mark Gillies, Volkswagen's senior manager for product and technology.
   
 Diesels were fantastic to drive, but EVs offer mountainous torque, instantaneous acceleration and smooth cruising. That's due to Volkswagen's underlying flexible EV architecture. Dubbed "MEB," the system utilizes a skateboard-style battery pack powering a rear motor on two-wheel-drive models and an additional motor for all-wheel-drive versions.
   
 MEB supports vehicles ranging in size from the Golf-size ID.3 to the large ID. ROOMZZ and ID. BUZZ concepts.
   
 Soothing America's nostalgia, Volkswagen committed to a production version of the ID. BUZZ, a vehicle that looks like the Euro train melted into a classic Microbus, by 2022. Inside, silver birch wood floors, captain's chairs that become tables and a third-row bench that converts into a bed imbue an urban hippie vibe, but with flatscreen instruments and capacitive touch steering wheel controls.
   
 The ID. ROOMZZ leans deeper into the 2020s as a sleek crossover with three rows of seats, head-up display with augmented reality, and front seats that can rotate rearward when the vehicle is in autonomous mode. It boasts 270 miles range and 80% charge in 30 minutes. All-wheel-drive and 369 horsepower promise an invigorating driving experience.
   
 Volkswagen must go electric to survive, but it's joining a crowded party. Tesla already dominates EVs and is being joined by virtually every automaker.
   
 On April 2, GM and Honda announced an agreement to share a new EV platform powered by efficient batteries for a range of vehicles wearing brands from both automakers. Production begins at GM plants in North America for 2024.
   
 "I think the German brand name, for a lot of people, is a bit of a premium," Caldwell said. "VW always skewed younger. Going to battery-electric vehicles, its younger demographic will help them. VWs have great design."
   
 Initial production of the ID.4 will come from Germany, but it will soon join the Passat and Atlas at Volkswagen's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where the automaker is investing $800 million and will create 1,000 jobs by 2022.
   
 Before that, there are challenges to overcome.
   
 "The diesel scandal lost a lot of the VW magic," Caldwell said. "They don't want to morph into another Honda or Toyota. Keeping some of the VW design and heritage is important to them. The ID.4 looks cool. A small utility is the type of vehicle people in the U.S. and around the world like."
   
 But overall, is pivoting to electric a good strategy?
   
 "Yes, I think it is a necessary strategy for them," Caldwell said. "Long-term, all automakers will be battery-electric. The end of diesel just came quicker than we thought."
   
 The journey from diesel to electric has been a long and convoluted one for Volkswagen, but turning lemons to lemonade is imprinted in the company's DNA. Recent challenges made VW a better automaker, better prepared for the future.
   
 "The company realized it needed a more robust compliance culture, and that has been implemented worldwide," Gillies said. "We expect to see a lot more electric vehicles in the lineup."

From the outset, though, it was clear Rodgers didn’t really know how best to employ Firmino while looking to also use Benteke as a target man.
 After two brief substitute appearances, the Brazilian started four successive Premier League games on the right flank – none of which were won – and was out with a back injury when Rodgers was jettisoned hours after a 1-1 draw at Everton.
 Enter Klopp. And if Firmino had been a ‘good transfer’ earlier, he was about to become a great one.
 “It was a short period (under Rodgers) but I considered him a great manager although I didn’t get much playing time under him,” said Firmino.
 “When results don’t come along, it is a must to switch managers.
 “I think Klopp has the typical Germany mentality. I do like his German methods, he concentrates and focuses on what he wants. I think he will help us. He brings good vibes.”
 Klopp was similarly encouraged. “I did not know him as a person before I came here but I knew him and liked him as a player and he is still not 100% to where he can go – not even close yet,” he said. “We spoke at the beginning and you could tell from his face he is looking forward to working together. There is a lot to come and it is a good situation for the club.”
 The first task was to find Firmino’s best position. A trip to Chelsea was on the horizon and the new Liverpool boss was asked what he could do with the enigmatic forward.
 “Last time with Brazil he played as a nine,” said Klopp. “Usually he plays in offensive midfield or second striker or comes from the wing, but he can play in the centre.”
 Sure enough, Firmino was the central striker at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea couldn’t cope with his movement. He laid on an assist for Philippe Coutinho before the benched Benteke came on to seal a 3-1 win.
 It was same story at the Etihad a few weeks later – Firmino with his first Liverpool goal and two more assists – as Manchester City were thumped 4-1, but outings in the role were rarities with Benteke back leading the attack.
 Matters changed after a dismal 2-0 defeat at West Ham United in January 2016 where Firmino had played in an attacking midfield position behind Benteke. In the next Premier League game at home to Arsenal, the Brazilian was back as the nine and scored twice before Benteke, again thrown on in the second half, laid on a late equaliser for Joe Allen in a 3-3 draw.
 Firmino scored a further three goals and provided two assists in his next four starts in the position before the return of Daniel Sturridge and form of Divock Origi saw him step back from being the attacking spearhead, playing in the nine role only once more that campaign.
 Indeed, in the last six Europa League ties that season, Firmino – who had scored in front of the Kop in the last 16 win over Manchester United – played in five different positions, his versatility a blessing for the team but a slight curse on his attempts to show his true value.

Having struggled the previous year with their recruitment in the wake of Luis Suarez’s departure, Liverpool had gone the extra yard to ensure Firmino signed on the dotted line.
 With Firmino tempted by the prospect of joining compatriot Philippe Coutinho at Anfield, Reds chief executive Ian Ayre, no doubt mindful of previous failures to conclude potential transfers, had flown to Santiago, where Brazil were preparing for a Copa America quarter-final against Paraguay, to get things done.
 Ayre returned from Chile with a deal sorted and personal terms agreed with Firmino on a five-year contract. But rather than a reason for cheer, behind the scenes the Brazilian had unwillingly found himself at the centre of a long-running power struggle between manager Brendan Rodgers and the club’s transfer committee.
 Rodgers, unhappy at being persuaded to sign Mario Balotelli the previous year against his better judgement, went along with Firmino’s signing provided Christian Benteke, his preferred big-money target, was later purchased.
 Benteke arrived for £32.5m a fortnight later, ensuring Firmino was only briefly Liverpool’s second-most expensive signing, the Belgian taking the number nine shirt. Firmino assumed the number 11 from the departing Oussama Assaidi.
 “He's a top-class player,” said Rodgers. “He's got all the traits and the profile of what we would want as a player – he works very, very hard, he's a talented player and someone we feel can score goals for the team.
 “Of course, there is no pressure. It just takes that little bit of time to adapt.”

Michael Franti & Spearhead have released a music video for their new song "I Got You." The track is the first single from their forthcoming album "Work Hard and Be Nice", which is scheduled for release on June 19th.
 Franti had this to say about the track, "This song is about how we support those around us, dream beyond our four walls, and grow deeper in connection to those we love (despite physical distancing), no matter what we face or how hard it seems in the moment."      Michael also directed and produced the video which was filmed while quarantined in Ubud, Bali and stars Franti, wife Sara and baby Taj. "We were challenged to create a video for a song about having a partner who helps you get through the darkest moments of life and helps you 'love deeper, fly higher, see clearer, burn brighter, than we ever did before,' while being stuck on lockdown," Franti said.
 "Because we didn't have the benefit of changing locations to shoot scenes that match lines, we worked over one hundred hours, after we shot the video on an iPhone, to edit the effects painstakingly in frame by frame.      "Even though the song isn't directly about COVID quarantining, its unique style was born out of the fact that all of us around the word are having to do the best we can, with the limited resources we have during home isolation." Watch the video below:

 Anita Gattine Anita Gattine never backed down from a fight. Life tested her more often than most but she remained generous, funny and fiercely independent - many say feisty - through all of the hardest times, right until the end. In fact, her final words are not printable in a family newspaper. Anita Wilhelm Gattine, formerly of Poughkeepsie, died April 28, 2020 at the Cedars Nursing Care Center in Portland, Maine. Born November 16, 1940 in Poughkeepsie, Anita was the daughter of the late Raymond J. and Edna Kelly Wilhelm. She loved her children with all her heart and her grandchildren even more. She developed deeply loyal friendships throughout her life. These relationships provided a constant source of joy and laughter as well as an anchor during life's challenges. A bold personality with an equally bold wardrobe, her driving earned her the nickname Anita Andretti. Her family and friends will never forget her infectious laugh and always tasteful jokes. She was a second mom to many of her kids' friends and always welcomed newcomers to her Crestwood Boulevard home. Anita loved animals and adored every dog and cat she welcomed into her home over the years. Anita was a successful real estate broker in Dutchess County for nearly two decades before moving to Maine in 2007 to be closer to family. Anita is survived by her children, Drew Gattine (Elizabeth) of Westbrook, Maine; Melissa Gattine (Andrew Baca) of Cumberland Center, Maine; and Steven Gattine (Melissa) of Trumansburg, New York; her 6 grandchildren, Jordan Gattine, Sabrina Gattine, Dakin Camp, Nathaniel Baca, Ellie Gattine and Duncan Gattine; and her brother, Gerry Wilhelm (Sandy) of Tucson, Arizona. She also leaves behind several nephews, nieces, godchildren and many friends. In addition to her parents, Anita was predeceased by her husband, Philip Gattine, and her beloved daughter, Jennifer Gattine. Anita's family would like to thank all of the staff at the Cedars for the wonderful care they gave her the last six years of her life. A Service to celebrate Anita will be held in Poughkeepsie when we can all gather to laugh again. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to The Cedars of Portland, www.thecedarsportland.org/giving/donate-now . To express online condolences and to participate in Anita's online tribute, please visit www.DolbyBlaisSegee.com .

It is with great sorrow the family of Steve A. Kmetz shares his passing on the afternoon of Wednesday, May 6, 2020, at home surrounded by loved ones. He was 89.      He was the husband of Marlene D. Kmetz for 65 years.      Steve was preceded in death by his parents, Steve and Stella Kmetz. During high school, he worked on the Will family farm, developing a love for farming and the earth. After he graduated from Lincoln High School in Dupont, Pa. in 1948, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served in the occupation forces in Japan for 11 months and then served in the Korean War for an additional 11 months. This stint in the military is where his acumen for numbers was discovered.      In 1951, he was awarded the Bronze Star, and in 1952 he was honorably discharged. During the next six years, he worked full time while attending night classes at La Salle University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration.      Putting his degree and math mind to work, he was employed by George H. Duross, Inc. of Philadelphia in the commercial roofing industry as Chief Estimator and Executive Vice President for 35 years (1961-1996). During his time at Duross, he and colleagues collaborated to invent a new kind of automatic standing seamer for metal roofing.      Mr. Kmetz was an avid golfer and longtime member of the Doylestown Country Club (1979-2019), where he served on various committees and on its Board of Directors. While at the family vacation home on Long Beach Island, N.J., he greatly enjoyed the sport of deep sea fishing with friends and family on the fair vessel, Carolyn Ann III. He enjoyed watching golf, and the Philadelphia Eagles, Phillies and Flyers with his son. He loved the Polish food his daughter prepared for him, friendly card games such as Gin, Poker, and Canasta, and walking with (while singing songs to) any baby present. And, thanks to his wife... he was an excellent ballroom dancer.      In addition to his beloved wife, Marlene, he is survived by his devoted children, son, Stephen F. Kmetz of Bensalem, Pa., and daughter, Christine K. Bates of Hinsdale, N.H.; his beloved sisters, Dolores Kolodgie of Glen Mills, Pa. and Georgette McHale of Tappan, N.Y.; six loving grandchildren, Derrick F. Kmetz and wife, Laura, Zachary S. Bates and partner, Luis, Elizabeth A. Carlton and partner, Nigel, Rhiannon Lee and husband, Cody, L. Carlton, and Ceridwyn Carlton; as well as six great grandchildren, Xavier, Kymani, Lily, Charlotte, Lex, and Qwynton. He also leaves behind nieces, nephews, a brother- in-law, and his dear goddaughter, Joann Haas and family.      Though his physical presence is already greatly missed, his spirit, love for life, and inquiring mind will continue through all the lives he touched.      Interment with military honors will be private at the convenience of the family.      In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Children's Home Society of N.J., 635 South Clinton Ave., Trenton, NJ 08611-1831.      To send condolences to the family, please visit the funeral home's web site below.      Shelly Funeral Home,      Warrington      www.shellyfuneralhomes.com

Opinion: In times like these it’s essential to keep our teams of research scientists and engineers engaged and supported.
 We all hope for a COVID-19 vaccine that will save lives and allow for a full economic and social recovery. Even in this welcome scenario, the economic reactivation and return to community life will be challenging.
 Canada most likely needs to prepare for a more ambiguous outcome in the absence of a vaccine. The return of social and community life will be accompanied by vigilant public-health monitoring. Economic activity may resume, but supply chain disruption and lower demand will present industry- specific and regional challenges.
 Canada's chief science adviser, Dr. Mona Nemer, and others experts are leading the national effort to ensure that the best scientific advice is applied to address the pandemic. In the recovery phase, we'll need Canada's full and formidable research capacity; our country has invested in science and this will serve us well in these uncertain times. Science asks fundamental questions without circumscribing the impact of the answers it generates. As a result, there is a storehouse of knowledge that can be applied to a variety of circumstances.
 We see such knowledge at work in the collective effort to flatten the curve for the current pandemic. The goal is to prevent the exponential growth of COVID-19 infection; mathematical modelling is combined with public health to enable governments to make tough decisions and to communicate to the public the life-saving importance of physical distancing. Meanwhile, our world-class health scientists are being deployed to lay the groundwork for development of a vaccine.
 Canada's global leadership in AI can be used to quickly process vast sets of anonymous mobile phone data to identify and predict new outbreaks. Canadian researchers in the social and economic sciences can help with understanding the societal impacts and potential of public-health measures.
 In times like these it's essential to keep our teams of research scientists and engineers engaged and supported, so they can be quickly up-and-running as the country emerges from lockdown and begins rebuilding in a changed world. In this context it's very encouraging to see the federal government's recently announced emergency funding of $291.6 million to support up to 40,000 student researchers and post-doctoral fellows through the federal granting councils.
 This investment in our future scientists and innovators will allow us to sustain the world-class calibre of Canada's research talent pool. Businesses, non-profits and communities can ensure this investment goes far and reaches every corner of Canada by bringing forward challenges they face in productivity and innovation. Our granting councils can provide funding for rapid responses connecting companies and other organizations with scientific expertise at universities and colleges that can be applied to obtain expedited solutions.
 The pandemic response in our country has reaffirmed that Canadians believe in caring for each other. This crisis has a way of clarifying what is truly valuable in our lives and society. Knowledge is one of those things. Canada's deep and talented research ranks are ready to help generate and apply the information and technology that will help our country emerge from this crisis in the most Canadian of ways -- strong and together.
  _Dr. Alejandro Adem is president of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, a federal granting council with a $1.3-billion budget. He is also a professor of mathematics at the University of B.C. (currently on leave)._

ISLAMORADA (AP) -- A teenager in the Florida Keys killed his younger brother, stabbed his father and then ran in front of a truck after a daylong search for him, authorities said Friday.
   
 The Monroe County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that the 17-year-old old boy was taken to a hospital in Miami with severe injuries Thursday evening. Authorities released his name, but The Associated Press does not generally identify juveniles who have been charged with a crime.
   
 A neighbor called deputies Thursday morning after the teen's 43-year-old father approached him, saying the boy had fatally stabbed his 14-year-old brother and then stabbed him multiple times, including in the neck.
   
 Investigators weren't sure what motivated the teen to attack his brother and father, the news release said.
   
 The brother was pronounced dead at the scene, and the father was airlifted to a trauma center in Miami.
   
 Online court records show that first-degree murder and aggravated battery charges initially were filed in circuit court against the teen. But a subsequent clerk's affidavit said the filing was in error and the case should have been filed in juvenile court, which has strict confidentiality restrictions.

He told me that he was never going to recover. That all the efforts left can only prolong his life, not cure. We spent the night crying on the phone.

"Sure they're ugly, Arthur says they're double ugly, but he never refuses a plate of my baked stuffed tautog."
 Jack was putting forth an argument about a last meal of one of his favorite dishes. It was early in the season and I was up to my armpits in alligators, deadlines, and work on two boats to get ready for the fishing season.
 My old friend was no longer able to walk the four blocks from his home to the old green bridge where he spent hours at a time fishing for his very favorite fish, the tautog, or blackfish as they are known from Connecticut to New York and Jersey.
 On some days, Jack was successful but on most others he was unable to catch one of those bucktoothed, leather-lipped denizens of the deep. When he did hook a decent fish, he had the task of hauling that fish up 32 feet from the water to the deck of the bridge without having the hook pull out.
 At that time you could buy cod for less than a dollar, but Jack would spend money on bait and tackle and invest his time in an attempt to catch what he considered the best-tasting fish that inhabited local waters.
 It was early spring, and after a cold and snowy winter it would be a while before the tautog moved back inshore from their winter habitat to the shallow and warmer waters of our rivers and bays in more catchable numbers.
 I can recall many a late spring night walking the deck of the old green bridge with my dad and visiting with the fishermen lined up on both sides of the street. I could not wait to move on to the next person to look in their buckets, which were usually galvanized pails from the Dover Stamping company that was located in the big red brick building on the corner of Plymouth
 Avenue. Employees could buy seconds and we acquired a lot of them at the Weetamoe Yacht Club from a member who worked there.
 For a boy of eight or ten it was like an Easter egg hunt.
 Some pails were empty while others held a tautog or two, the occasional eel and quite a few big white perch, which were also inclined to take a bite out of a green crab or piece of clam.
 It was the sharpies with the wet burlap bags that received the most scrutiny. I recall coming up on a man with a burlap bag with a large bulge laying alongside his bucket. The fish inside was still quite alive and flipping but when I asked how the fishing was he never made eye contact. Looking straight ahead, he said he hadn't got a single bite.
 My father chuckled, took me by the hand and pulled me along.
 "That is a man who doesn't want or need any company."
 At that time, the winter flounder, or blackback, was the most popular and available fish in the Taunton River and Mt Hope Bay and those flat fish fed a lot of working-class families, including my own.
 The problem was that with their tiny mouths they did not bother with the large green crabs used for tautog bait and preferred the soft and slender texture of sea worms.
 The next most popular species was the aforementioned tautog, often referred to as tog or, toto, by the older Portuguese gents who kept boats at the boat club and the fish shacks along the river.
 I enjoyed flounder fishing, but those tautog could sure pull the string and they were much more difficult to catch than the flounder.
 In the ensuing years, the flounder has become nothing more than a fond memory and fishing for them is prohibited in Narragansett and Mt Hope Bay and their tributaries. The tautog, which are nowhere near their former abundance, are on the mend and are still available for those who don't mind putting in their time. They still prefer rocky lairs covered with mussels and they have such a craving for green crabs they will occasionally eat one with a 3/0 Kirby hook in it; if you are skillful enough to pull the trigger before your crab is stolen.
 Today we are fishing with much better tackle than the handlines of yesterday and the braided lines allow you to feel the slightest touch.
 Jack was well aware of the possibilities, or lack thereof, of catching a tog that early in the season, but for some reason that old-timer either had exceptional faith in me or knew how to
 encourage me to get the best results.
 Whatever his motives, I collected a coffee can of green crabs to use as my tackle, and without a boat in the water I headed for the bridge.
 There was very little action and only a few bites from the bait-stealing choggies. After almost two cold hours of feeding them, I was packing up my gear to head back to Jack with the bad news when George, who was fishing much closer to the Somerset side, came walking towards me.
 "It's still too cold and a bit too early for a good run of tog, but I managed to scratch up two fair-sized ones on the bottom of the outgoing tide, just before you arrived. Its been dead since then."
 I thanked him for the information and told him I would not be there without the appeal of my old friend Jack. George knew Jack and was aware of his failing health, mentioning that he had not seen him on the bridge in over two years.
 I began to walk away when he called me.
 "I'm going to make you a deal. I only need one fish for my table, and I will loan you the other for the old man, but only if he assumes you caught it."
 I thought that was an odd request, but it was a chance to fulfill the wish of a man who had been very good to this boy.
 "When you begin striper fishing and get an extra fish, think of my wife. For some reason she loves striper and would love to have a fillet."
 I took the fish and promised to fulfill my part of the bargain, to which he responded, "That fish is going to taste a lot better to him if he believes you caught it rather than knowing it was a gift from a near stranger."
 I thought about that as Jack was grinning from ear to ear at the sight of his prize. He cleaned, stuffed and baked that tog like you would a Thanksgiving turkey and the big section he sent over to my family was delicious.
 It was almost two years later when I knocked on George's door with a fresh striper fillet wrapped in wax paper. He looked at me and told me he remembered my dad and the little boy he walked the bridge with, and said he had no doubt that I would hold up my end of the bargain.
 Old Jack, who had passed on several months after baking his last tautog, went on to meet his maker with one of his last requests satisfied with the cooperation of two fellow fishermen. Amen.

 ISLAMORADA (AP) -- A teenager in the Florida Keys killed his younger brother, stabbed his father and then ran in front of a truck after a daylong search for him, authorities said Friday.
 The Monroe County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that the 17-year-old old boy was taken to a hospital in Miami with severe injuries Thursday evening. Authorities released his name, but The Associated Press does not generally identify juveniles who have been charged with a crime.
 A neighbor called deputies Thursday morning after the teen's 43-year-old father approached him, saying the boy had fatally stabbed his 14-year-old brother and then stabbed him multiple times, including in the neck.
 Investigators weren't sure what motivated the teen to attack his brother and father, the news release said.
 The brother was pronounced dead at the scene, and the father was airlifted to a trauma center in Miami.
 Online court records show that first-degree murder and aggravated battery charges initially were filed in circuit court against the teen. But a subsequent clerk's affidavit said the filing was in error and the case should have been filed in juvenile court, which has strict confidentiality restrictions.

 May is wildfire preparation season for the Eugene Springfield Fire Department.
 Crews at Station 1 conducted training and practice Saturday to be ready to prevent and fight wildfires. The crews started the day checking their gear and practicing fire shelter deployment.
 In the afternoon they practiced hose deployment with pre-made hose packs that help them reach 500 feet from their fire engine, according to a news release.
 While fire crews prepare to fight fire, residents can do their part to make sure their property is ready in the event of a fire. Learn more at Team Up 4 Fire Safety at eugene-or.gov/2896/WUI.
 Residents can help by reducing brush and dead wood, an important first step to creating a defensible space. Near a home, this buffer zone will ideally extend 100 feet from the house in the wildland.
 In other work to prevent wildfires, the fire department and Parks and Open Space have partnered with the Bureau of Land Management on a major effort to reduce the risk of fire in Ridgeline natural areas and West Eugene. They are removing dense vegetation in several locations and continuing ecological burns by trained City and BLM fire staff to improve wildfire buffer zones.

“Strangers in the Street (featuring P.P. Arnold)” is the result of an idea that began to take root in the winter of 2019. When both artists' touring plans for 2020 were postponed due to the Covid-19 lockdown they used this unexpected spare time to complete the track, The Fratellis working from their homes in Scotland and P.P. Arnold working from her home in Spain. Like so many artists who are now finding new ways of working during this crisis, The Fratellis and P.P. Arnold, who have yet to meet in person, adapted quickly to the new restrictions and have created a beautiful, emotive, piano and strings arrangement of a song that lyrically appears to have been written for the moment, but was in fact written last year.

May is wildfire preparation season for the Eugene Springfield Fire Department.
   
 Crews at Station 1 conducted training and practice Saturday to be ready to prevent and fight wildfires. The crews started the day checking their gear and practicing fire shelter deployment.
   
 In the afternoon they practiced hose deployment with pre-made hose packs that help them reach 500 feet from their fire engine, according to a news release.
   
 While fire crews prepare to fight fire, residents can do their part to make sure their property is ready in the event of a fire. Learn more at Team Up 4 Fire Safety at eugene-or.gov/2896/WUI.
   
 Residents can help by reducing brush and dead wood, an important first step to creating a defensible space. Near a home, this buffer zone will ideally extend 100 feet from the house in the wildland.
   
 In other work to prevent wildfires, the fire department and Parks and Open Space have partnered with the Bureau of Land Management on a major effort to reduce the risk of fire in Ridgeline natural areas and West Eugene. They are removing dense vegetation in several locations and continuing ecological burns by trained City and BLM fire staff to improve wildfire buffer zones.

"I don't necessarily think that if we're talking in hypotheticals and we're having to make the tough decision about a program that athletic success would be a determining factor," Laurita said. "I would agree, I think we've had a lot of historic success across the board in most of our programs, so it's hard to think about the possibility that that wouldn't be there.

 "It's not the easiest way, but it's certainly one that brings us further in this individualistic society." Check out the song below:

The news of shifting over some manufacturing from Asia to the US isn't new, with news that Trump wanted TSMC and Foxconn to consider moving to the US for manufacturing breaking in January 2017 -- right as Donald Trump was being inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States.But now, there are renewed talks between the Trump administration and Intel and TSMC about moving production to the US for some of its chip factories. Intel might already have a big presence in the US, but the talks with Intel could see Team Blue opening up a foundry that other companies could use to make products.The Wall Street Journal reports that a 'new crop of cutting-edge chip factories in the US would reshape the industry and mark a U-turn after decades of expansion into Asia by many American companies eager to reap investment incentives and take part in a robust regional supply chain'.As it stands the US (and the world) are heavily reliant on TSMC making some of the most advanced chips in the world, but they're all the way in Taiwan. If there were a war, conflict, or even a natural disaster then it could bring the world and chip production, to its knees.The WSJ reports that they spoke to a TSMC spokesperson who said that the Taiwanese company was 'actively evaluating' making plants in other countries. TSMC adds that there was 'no concrete plan' on this right now.Another concern is if Intel were making chips for other companies, let's say -- AMD, how would their secrets be safe? This is a major issue, and something that would need to be ironed out.

Manchester United captain Harry Maguire labelled Marcus Rashford the most talented player he has ever played with.
 Rashford, 22, was enjoying a fine season, scoring 19 goals in 31 games, before suffering a serious back injury in January.
 The England forward has continued to improve and Maguire lauded his United team-mate's talent.
 "I think as a club, you should have a captain and rely on him, but you need to spread the onus of the leadership in the group," the defender told UTD Podcast.
 "Marcus is there and he battles through every game. Obviously he's had a bad injury but he's battling hard to get back. He very rarely misses games.
 "He's always wanting to make himself available. I think you can see around the place, on and off the field as well, he's excellent with his charity work, which is great to see.
 "On the pitch, like I said, he's amazed me. He's the most talented player I've ever played with."
 Rashford, who also has 10 goals in 38 games for England, was enjoying his most prolific campaign for United, reaching double-digits in the Premier League for the second straight season.
 While Maguire hailed his team-mate, he was wary of putting too much pressure on Rashford.
 "I've always spoken so highly of Marcus when I have been with him in the England squad. I can't speak highly enough of him. I think he's going to go on to have an exceptional career," he said.
 "I don't want to put too much pressure on him but I think he's going to be a wonderful player for Manchester United, as he is now.
 "He's the best six-a-side player I've played with. Marcus is in my team and I know he'd be banging in goals left, right and centre."
