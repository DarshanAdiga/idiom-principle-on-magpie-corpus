Dorin Cioabă, regele romilor din România, spune că măsurile nu sunt suficiente.   "Suntem foarte supărați noi, cei din comunitate, și familia, pentru că acțiunea celor de la ISU este foarte slabă. Nu caută. Trec cu șalupa o dată, de două ori pe zi. Nu s-au făcut căutările așa cum ar trebui. Sunt niște scorburi acolo. Copila ar putea să fie prinsă sub acele scorburi. Au venit oameni din toată țara să ne ajute. Era să se mai înece și alții. Am demarat și noi căutări, dar îi punem în pericol pe oameni. Familia intră în apă, era să se înece și ea. Trebuie amplificate căutările, nu abandonate. Noi știm că ea nu mai poate să fie în viață, dar trupul ei trebuie măcar recuperat", spune Dorin Cioabă.   Potrivit acestuia, fetița fusese chemată, marți, la joacă, de o prietenă de vârstă apropiată.   "O altă fetiță a venit și a luat-o. Au plecat fără să îi vadă părinții. A durat cinci- zece minute. În capătul străzii e Cibinul. Fetița a anunțat niște oameni care erau în zonă, pe mal, că: "Haideți, că mi-a căzut prietena în apă!". Și așa, oamenii și-au dat seama că a căzut fetița. Oamenii nu au sărit, că e prea mare apa. Au chemat 112. Au trecut mai mult de 48 de ore. La început, au fost multe mașini de poliție, jandarmi, dar toată lumea stătea pe malul apei, pe pod. M-am certat cu ei. De ce nu acționați? "Păi nu avem ce face!", au zis. La un moment dat au plecat, acum văd că mai trec din când în când. Am vorbit cu șeful ISU mai devreme, m-a asigurat că a cerut închiderea barajului de la Gura Râului, pentru două ore. Apa a început să se micșoreze. În aceste două ore ar trebui ca apa să fie controlată de ISU. Îi sprijinim și noi. Eu nu am ce să fac mai mult, doar pun presiune pe autorități", mai spune regele romilor din România.   În sprijinul familiei au venit oameni din mai multe județe ale țării.   "Am intrat în apă și noi, și bunica fetei, care era să se înece. Vrem să se pună mai multe forțe, mai mulți oameni de la ISU să meargă până la Mohu, că de acolo nu poate să treacă mai departe fetița. Au fost în prima seară sibieni care au căutat cu lanterna. Am stat și eu până la două noaptea. Ne rugăm să iasă și mai mulți să ne ajute, să o înmormântăm creștinește", spune unul dintre romii care au venit din Alba.

We have opportunities to continue to take cost out and just manage -- also opportunity, as Don indicated, to continue to manage our working capital and inventory in particular. So we've made some good progress. We have a lot of work to do, and our team is very focused on that right now, certainly, even in light of the COVID-19 situation and we expect to continue to focus on those things that we have been focusing on and we continue to make -- we expect to continue to make progress in all those areas. And obviously we have to take the demand side into account, just given the uncertainty that we see in our end markets right now, but we think we're positioned very well. And again, we believe the momentum that we had through the first 11 months of our fiscal '20 period will help us emerge more quickly as the end markets continue to improve in the current environment.

A 28-year-old youth is feared to have drowned while taking a bath in the canal near Khanpur village on Wednesday.
 Police said the youth, Mandeep Singh of Gagan Nagar, Daba, went to the canal with his four friends, who claimed that he lost his balance in the water and drowned.
 However, Mandeep's family alleged that his friends murdered him and dumped the body in the canal, as his clothes, recovered near the canal, had traces of blood on them.
 The Daba police have pressed in divers to trace the missing youth.
 Mandeep's brother Shamsher Singh told the police that one of his friends had bought a motorcycle against his name, but was not paying the EMIs. Therefore, Mandeep had been asking his friend to pay the EMIs or surrender the vehicle, which may be behind the incident, he alleged.
 Inspector Pavittar Singh, SHO at Daba police station, said divers were working to trace Mandeep.

"Andremo a Lourdes per ringraziare la Vergine Maria e per affidarci una volta di piu alla sua protezione materna", dichiara don Remo Chiavarini, amministratore delegato dell'Opera romana pellegrinaggi. "Abbiamo ascoltato le parole di Papa Francesco che ci hanno invitato a trarre frutto da questo tempo di crisi profonda, diffusa in tutti i Paesi - riflette il sacerdote -. Ricordiamo le sue parole: 'Peggio di questa crisi, c'e solo il dramma di sprecarla, chiudendoci in noi stessi'. Proprio per non chiuderci, per dare nuovo vigore alla vita delle nostre comunita ed al nostro spirito missionario, abbiamo deciso di ritornare nei luoghi santi, dove piu forte e l'azione dello Spirito, la vera sorgente dell'evangelizzazione. Abbiamo molti motivi per prenderci un tempo di preghiera in questi luoghi di speciale vicinanza al Signore. Possiamo ringraziarlo per aver protetto le nostre vite, ma anche chiedere aiuto per tutte le nostre necessita, cosi come consegnare nelle sue mani tutte le persone a noi care. Diamo alla nostra citta un'occasione di rinforzare la fiducia e la speranza, di sentirci confortati e rassicurati, di crescere in un vero senso di solidarieta". Andare a Lourdes, conclude, "significa avere un momento di sosta, di silenzio e di contemplazione nella propria vita. Vivere un'esperienza di vera spiritualita per arrivare a Gesu tramite la tenerezza di Maria".

After interrupting his "Daily Show" stint to direct the little-seen "Rosewater," Stewart is on somewhat more commercial turf here. That said, the liveliest sequence actually comes during the closing credits, when Stewart appears on camera interviewing an election expert in what amounts to a tutorial about what you've just watched.
 Carell is fine, but the whole fish-out-of-water formula -- first with him in farm country, later with the colonel accompanying him on a fundraising trip to court big-city donors -- doesn't feel particularly inspired. It's too "Green Acres"-ish for its own good.
 In some respects, "Irresistible" is a victim of high expectations. It's mostly entertaining, and reasonably smart; still, for those who miss Stewart spinning out lacerating satire four nights a week, this doesn't rise a level that would justify giving that up, the grind of it all notwithstanding.
 Heading into campaign season, Stewart has certainly served up food for thought -- especially about the media-fueled transformation of politics into entertainment and tribal warfare. Like his advocacy for 9/11 first responders, he's also made clear that he's less interested in scoring partisan points than exposing systemic flaws, though it's difficult to discuss the latter without wagging fingers at those responsible for them.
 Ultimately, though, "Irresistible" seeks to sway hearts and open minds, and perhaps inevitably winds up preaching -- and yes, that's the operative term -- to the choir. As road tests go, Stewart's movie passes inspection, but just barely.

DuBOIS — The Hound staged an improbable late-game rally Wednesday night, but it went for naught as Sunny 106 used a 3-run top of the eighth to pull out a wild 12-9 extra-inning victory in Junior League softball action at Heindl Field.
 Sunny took a 9-4 lead to the bottom of the seventh behind starter Morgan Pasternak, who had allowed just four hits to that point. However, The Hound got to the lefty in the seventh as it capitalized on some shallow defense in the outfield to hit three inside-the-park home runs in a five-run outburst that tied the game.
 That huge inning came on the heels of The Hound turning a triple on defense in the top of the seventh after Sunny’s Brooke Scolese and Grace Reynolds had opened the inning with walks.
 The Hound made a pitching change to start the eighth, pulling starter Melia Mitskavich in favor of Kali Franklin. The reliever quickly retired the leadoff hitter but then walked Ava Baronick and Pasternak. That brought Eva Bloom to the plate, and the cleanup hitter did just that, ripping a 3-run inside-the- park homer to left to put her team back on top 12-9.
 Bloom, who added a double, finished 2-for-4 with four RBIs. Baronick also had a big evening at the plate, going 2-for-3 with a triple, RBI and two runs scored. Pasternak, who got the win in the circle, was 1-for-1 at the plate with three walks and four runs scored.
 Holding a 12-9 lead, Pasternak started the bottom of the eighth in the circle but was pulled after walking Riley Mooney and Reese Lunger. Baronick came on in relief and quickly ended any thoughts of another Hound rally.
 She struck out Tatelyn Jones, then got Tessa Shaffer to pop into a game-ending double play to earn the save.
 It was all Sunny in the early going, as the visitors jumped out to a 5-1 lead after three innings.
 Teegan Runyon lead of the game with a walk and raced around to score from there when Pasternak singled to center and the ball was bobbled in the outfield. Pasternak then scored to make it 2-0 when Bloom reached on an error.
 Sunny added to that lead in the second when Jenna Cornelius blasted a leadoff triple and scored on a groundout by Reagan Perkins.
 The Hound got that run back in the bottom of the second when Franklin hammered a leadoff inside-the-park home run into the right field corner. That proved to be the only real blemish against Pasternak through four innings, as she recorded seven strikeouts and allowed just the one hit through that stretch.
 Sunny pushed its lead to 5-1 with two more runs in the third.
 Runyon reached on a one-out error and promptly scored when Baronick tripled to right-center. She was thrown out at home trying to stretch it into an inside- the-park homer.
 Pasternak kept the inning going with a two-out walk and scored from first on a Blloom double that saw her thrown out trying to stretch that hit into a triple to end the inning.
 The Hound pulled closer in the bottom of the fifth with a pair of runs.
 Mitskavich got things started with a one-out double and scored on a Franklin single to right. Franklin later scored on a wild pith with two outs to make it a 5-3 game.
 Sunny answered right back with a four-run top of the sixth that featured RBI singles by Maggie Watt and Haley Reed. The Hound got one right back in the bottom half when Jordan McGranor drew a leadoff walk and later scored on a fielder’s choice hit by Lunger.
 That sent the game to the seventh with the Sunny leading 9-4 and set the stage for The Hound’s huge comeback after turning the triple play on defense in the top of the inning.
 Kayley Risser jump-started the bottom of the seventh with a one-out inside- the-park homer to center. Mitskavich then did the same with two outs to make it 9-6.

It's tough to get an appointment at the dentist's office right now for those that are open. So I do think there is some pent-up demand there.

"I've heard of something that sounds like that name, but we don't have it here," Fatima Moalin, a resident of Sakow town in southern Somalia, told the AP when reached by phone. "Muslims don't contract such a thing."
 Others in rural Somalia, especially in areas held by the al-Qaida-linked al- Shabab extremist group, have been dismissive of the virus. Somali authorities cite limited internet access, limited awareness campaigns and even extremists' restrictions on communications with the outside world.
 A recent assessment by the U.N. migration agency of displaced people in Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland found "very high" levels of misunderstanding, with some people confusing COVID-19 with a mosquito-borne disease or thinking a key symptom of the respiratory disease was diarrhea.
 But most respondents were aware of the pandemic, thanks largely to radio broadcasts, word of mouth and messages played by mobile phone services while waiting for someone to pick up — a common approach in many countries in Africa.
 "Slowly, slowly the information is getting there," Bean said.

I would tell you that the situation certainly continues to be a bit fluid although definitely improving and our teams have literally been working around the clock to identifying approved new sources of products, just given the changes and the types of products our customers are using and not to mention just the overall increase in demand for these products. So it's certainly been a challenge across the industry and our customers are certainly experiencing that.

We also -- just in light of the current situation, we expect the market to continue to see the value of single visit dentistry, it would certainly makes sense now perhaps more than ever in the current environment. So we're very focused on helping our customers continue to see the value and investing in new equipment and technology. And we think we have a tremendous offering to help them take advantage of that to help them build their -- build and invest in their practices and really the support that we provide throughout the complete lifecycle. So again, while we expect it to be perhaps a bit slower to recover, we think there is still a tremendous opportunity for dental practices to invest in equipment and technology, again to improve the productivity and profitability of their practices.

Nelson said an essential factor in developing the plan is ensuring the perspective of classroom teachers are being considered. She said the committees are exploring the challenges that could arise from safety precautions that are put in place and also considering what online learning might look like with additional training and support for staff.
 “I’m confident that they can rise to the occasion if we support them in the process of getting there,” said Nelson.
 Nelson said one committee has focused on academic rigors regarding online teaching and learning and working to deliver a full comprehensive model of instruction for students. She said with the training that will be provided for the teaching staff, the district can provide a stronger model for the students.
 “We are setting the stage to provide three days of training for all of our teaching staff in July,” said Nelson.
 Nelson said the district is building the Return to Learn plan for two reasons. One is state compliance and the second is it will increase the ability to use technology in the classroom daily to provide a blended model of instruction.
 “So, we don’t want to waste our efforts,” said Nelson. “We want to go into this fall knowing that we’ll be teaching, and delivering instruction, and using some of the tools that we’re developing. And, if we have to transition to a point where we’re completely removed, we’ll be prepared to do that. And, it will be more natural for our students, because they will already have explored and used the tools.”
 Nelson said technology continues to be the largest concern for the district. She said the district would need to purchase an additional 105 Chromebooks for students in lower grade levels. The purchase would be funded from the CARES Act and could cost up to $30,000.
 Another concern Nelson said is the areas of Shenandoah that have limited access to WiFi.
 “Some of our planning in this area is to consider opening our buildings earlier in the

 morning and keeping them open a little later in the evening so that students can come and work earlier in the morning or after school,” said Nelson.
 Nelson said the district has also relocated access points to different areas of school buildings to help people connect to WiFi in the school building parking lots. She also plans to recommend the district purchase hotspots for different areas of the community and look at additional ways to extend more community access. Nelson said access would be restricted and the district would be able to control that by purchasing the equipment. Funding from the CARES ACT would cover the cost of buying the equipment.
 One area in the plan that continues to change is health and safety issues.
 “The committee came up with recommendations that we felt we could work with in our school environment,” she said. “Things like hallway passageways being identified, when to wear a mask, or when you wouldn’t have to. We could use the lunchroom maybe at 50% capacity, depending on the extent of how COVID was affecting the community.”

 Let’s keep powder dry this Fourth and next
 Every year we endure the tragic results of exploding fireworks on the Fourth of July.
 The wildfires, injuries, traumatized veterans with PTSD, terrified and runaway animals and air quality alerts that follow in the wake of these pyrotechnic events should be evidence enough to “call it quits” on this outdated ritual.
 The act of setting off or watching fireworks does not make someone a patriot, and with all its now well-known negative effects, it is quite frankly the opposite of true patriotism.

I would say, we've been working on improving our cost management to position and just improving our overall cost position structurally for the past couple of years now, and also certainly balancing those changes with appropriate investments that we also felt we needed to make back into the business as part of our turnaround. So that's not something that we just started working on. We obviously took some immediate actions in light of COVID-19 and certainly we'll continue to identify opportunities where we believe we can improve our cost position and also balance that with the investments that are needed as we kind of take the long game here.
