CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — The Calgary Zoo will be returning two giant pandas on loan from China because a scarcity of flights due to COVID-19 has caused problems with getting enough bamboo to feed them.
 Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Calgary in 2018 after spending five years at the Toronto Zoo and were to remain in the Alberta city until 2023.
 The zoo’s president, Clement Lanthier, said this week the facility spent months trying to overcome transportation barriers in acquiring fresh bamboo and decided it’s best for the animals to be in China, where their main food source is abundant.
 “It’s about the animals. At the end of the day, we cannot pretend that we care for animals if we don’t take those tough decisions,″ Lanthier said. “We believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao to be during these challenging and unprecedented times is where bamboo is abundant and easy to access.″
 Lanthier said the zoo had contingency plans for a steady supply of fresh bamboo, but limits on flights from China was the first problem. Transporting more from California added even more frustrations.
 “Every week, every 10 days there is more and more problem moving bamboo to Calgary. This risk is unacceptable. We don’t feel comfortable at all that we can impose that risk on the health and the welfare of the pandas.”

The Seattle author and artist of the well-received Fantagraphics graphic novel “I Know What I Am: The Life and Times of Artemisia Gentileschi” published the passion project recently, just as there was renewed interest in the Italian renaissance painter with the heartbreaking story. In what seemed like an example of good karma, the seven years of effort she put into the drawings was going to be rewarded.
 Siciliano participated in an exhibit of a Gentileschi painting at Seattle Art Museum last year and was scheduled to travel to London earlier this spring to view a National Gallery exhibition of Gentileschi paintings, many of which appear in her book.

In the same issue of JAMA Pediatrics, editor Dr. Dimitri Christakis made a plea for US lawmakers to start the process of reopening schools.
 "The risks posed by delaying school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for students from low-income families," Christakis, who is the director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, wrote in the editorial.
 Christakis expressed concern that states are beginning to reopen workplaces -- which pose a much higher risk for spread than classrooms -- while cancelling schools for the remainder of the year. He noted that the White House coronavirus task force has given little attention to schools in its daily briefings.
 "To help inform states and counties that are struggling to make this enormously consequential and urgent decision regarding the fall semester, an expert task force focusing exclusively on school closure should be convened immediately," Christakis wrote.

Flanders DC, MAD-Home of Creators, WallonieBruxelles Design Mode en Wallonie Design, willen de kracht van designers binnen een veranderende maatschappij onder de aandacht brengen. Ze schreven samen een open brief waarin ze die oproep toelichten. 'Deze situatie stelt een aantal verworven zekerheden die onze instellingen en bedrijven aansturen, ter discussie. Het post-COVID- tijdperk mag zich niet beperken tot een terugkeer naar het vroegere normaal,' klinkt het. De organisaties roepen op om nieuwe oplossingen te overwegen. Ze stellen dat de crisis aantoont dat er nood is aan een analyse van de bestaande systemen, 'zowel op organisatorisch, materieel, logistiek, gezondheids- als educatief vlak.' Laat dat nu precies zijn wat designers doen: 'Dat is de essentie van de designpraktijk.'De brief stelt dat er heel wat domeinen zijn die nood hebben aan oplossingen. 'Ontwerpexpertise kan daar alleen maar een meerwaarde bij opleveren, of het nu economisch of ethisch, menselijk of systemisch is.' Designers zouden volgens de organisaties deel moeten uitmaken van 'de multi-disciplinaire gesprekken om mee te dromen en te bedenken, en vervolgens een prototype te maken van een wenselijke, haalbare en levensvatbare toekomst.' En niet enkel aan de gesprekken zouden designers moeten deelnemen, maar ze kunnen de werkgroepen ook ondersteunen op een verfrissende manier. Out of the box denken ligt immers in de aard van de designers, waardoor ze de vastgeroeste systemen in vraag kunnen stellen en op een constructieve manier oplossingen kunnen aanreiken. Wanneer mensen uit verschillende sectoren en achtergronden de handen in elkaar slaan, komt er vaak iets beters en innovatiever uit. Waarom de expertise van designers niet inzetten voor thema's zoals mobiliteit, zorg, politiek, financiën, dierenwelzijn, enzoverder? Als het van Flanders DC, MAD-Home of Creators, WallonieBruxelles Design Mode en Wallonie Design afhangt, bouwen designers mee aan de toekomst, aan de wereld post corona.

After four years of meticulous planning, the team pulled off the most audacious flight of the century back in April 2012.
 Using state of the art equipment, they managed to safely crash the plane, Big Flo, into the desert and keep the wreckage intact to analyse the data.
 Pilot James Slocum, 55, took the plane filled with dummy passengers up into the air and parachuted out just minutes before it smashed into the ground.
 This is near impossible on most commercial planes as jumpers would be sucked into the engines, but the 727 has a hatch underneath the tail which offers a less dangerous escape route.
 Controlling the plane remotely, former US Navy pilot Chip Shanle slammed the jet into the ground “high vertical load impact” where the plane falls short of the runway - producing some spectacular results.

The list of economic upheavals that Mike Richardson, publisher of Milwaukie, Oregon-based Dark Horse Comics and owner of the Things From Another World comic book store, has managed to overcome in his 30-plus years in business is harrowing.
 The coronavirus pandemic is just the latest.
 “There was ‘Black September’ and the crash of the black-and-white comics in the late ‘80s, the speculator bust of the mid-‘90s, the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, 9/11, and the Great Recession of 2008,” Richardson said. “We made it through those events, and though this is far more serious, we’ll make it through this one, too.”
 The pandemic has many fearing for the future of the comic book, that beloved but increasingly anachronistic driver of modern pop culture. We live in one of that industry’s great hubs, with four of the top 20 publishers and a high density of creators, so what matters to the comics industry matters in the Pacific Northwest.

“Who knew that 2020 would be the year that the vinyl album and the classic American comic book would just kind of disappear,” mused Eric Reynolds, associate publisher at Seattle’s Fantagraphics Books.
 While tongue-in-cheek, that’s an apt comparison. The vinyl album and the comic book share a lot of things in common, including their fragility. Both are delightfully nostalgic for folks of a certain age, largely aimed at a niche audience that has disposable income and require a network of enthusiastic small businesses whose owners are willing to surf the margin of profitability to enable their passions.
 And both have been sidelined by the pandemic.
 The comics industry effectively came to a halt during the shutdowns. Social distancing restrictions and stay-home orders kept stores from fully opening, and even those that offered online or call-in mail-order services had no new comics to sell, mostly only stock on hand.
 That’s because North America’s two specialized comic book printers — both located in Canada — shuttered, as did the only major comics distributor, Diamond Comic Distributors, which handles about 75% of the comic books sold in the U.S. Already-printed comics got trapped in distribution warehouses, too.
 Now, when shipments do start again — Diamond says it will start shipping orders May 20, and many of those previously waylaid orders will start flowing in, too — many shops will struggle to come up with the money to pay for orders. The industry has also been roiled by the actions of DC and Marvel, both of which said they would release some missed April titles on digital platforms only.
 “We're nervous no matter what,” said Chris Ureta Casos, manager of Seattle’s Comics Dungeon. “This industry is always on thin ice. And the Seattle market is a whole 'nother problem because everything's just so expensive here and because of [competition from] Amazon. So this is definitely increasing all those fears tenfold.”

 "It's like a battlefield. If this was a real plane with real people on board then there would still be bodies of people who died in this accidents," said Anne, who has to inform families that their loved ones have died as part of her job.
 With forces peaking at the front, the people in middle zone at 8g would have survived with minor injuries, while the rear at 6g would only have felt like being hit by a bumper car.
 Giving her analysis, Anne said: “It is safer to sit at the back of the aircraft. The front often sees higher impact forces. I would pick somewhere within a few rows of an emergency exit.”

When the plane eventually came to a halt the fire crews rushed in but feared an explosion as a drone indicated the engines were still running.
 A fuel line rupture could have lead to a fire jeopardising all the scientific date on board, so they directed a solid jet of water into the engines to stop a fireball.
 The Mexican government wanted the clean up operation to begin immediately so the science team rushed on board to find out the results.
 The catastrophic forces caused by the initial impact destroyed the nose of the plane and would likely have killed the entire flight crew.
 The first 11 rows of seats were crushed and experienced forces of 12g, so if the plane had been full, 66 ­passengers would have lost their lives.
