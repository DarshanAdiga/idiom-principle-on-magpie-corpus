 More Americans are happy about President Donald Trump losing his bid to be re-elected than they are that his rival Joe Biden won, a poll revealed Wednesday. The poll by Monmouth University in New Jersey also found that a majority of Americans are confident that this month's presidential election was conducted fairly, although most Trump voters think Biden's victory is due to voter fraud. 'Overall, just over half of the American public is either happy (34%) or satisfied (18%) about Trump's defeat, while nearly 4 in 10 are dissatisfied (28%) or angry (10%),' according to the poll. 'Likewise, just over half are either happy (25%) or satisfied (26%) about Biden's victory, while just over 4 in 10 are dissatisfied (29%) or angry (15%),' it showed. Among Biden voters, 57% say they are happy that their choice won, but even more (73%) are happy that Trump lost. Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said the Nov. 3 presidential election was always about the incumbent first and foremost. 'The thought of his loss provoking a stronger positive reaction than the idea of a Biden victory is just one more example of that,' said Murray. According to the poll, there are still deep partisan divisions in the aftermath of the election. Sixty percent of Americans believe Democrat Biden won the election fair and square, while 32% say he only won it due to voter fraud. The poll was conducted by telephone from Nov. 12-16 with 810 adults. The results have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.

It's also the ideal opportunity to hand Van de Beek his first start in the Premier League, as it's a game where his versatility in midfield could prove to be extremely valuable against a side that are likely to sit back and defend.
 Van de Beek's ability on the ball could also be important to unlocking that defence to create opportunities for his teammates or get a goal himself, having scored eight goals and contributed five assists in the Eredivisie last term and found the net in the Netherlands' 1-1 draw with Spain last week.
 Bruno Fernandes is the first name on the teamsheet right now but problems continue with Paul Pogba, who is still yet to hit his best form consistently with United.
 With tough games coming up over the festive period, the time to settle in for Van de Beek is starting to seep away and he needs to be ready for those difficult matches.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

A poco mas de un mes para la Navidad, no parece que el espiritu navideño impere en el Congreso de los Diputados, y menos entre afines ideologicos. Con indisimulada satisfaccion, el periodico _El Pa is_, relata lo sucedido el pasado martes en el Parlamento, cuando se debatia la propuesta del PP que pretendia sustituir el estado de alarma que estamos disfrutando mediante la reforma de dos leyes organicas: la de Medidas Especiales en materia de Salud Publica y la reguladora de la jurisdiccion contencioso-administrativa, que posibilitarian que las CCAA pudieran, bajo el control judicial, confinar a poblaciones o personas determinadas, en caso de pandemia. Este plan B, discurrido por Casado, el lider del PP, toco debatirlo en el dia de Santa Isabel de Hungria y el diputado de Vox dijo, para terminar su discurso nada amigable, que era "un conjunto de tonterias". Como todavia resonaban en el hemiciclo las acusaciones del mismo Casado a la mocion de censura propuesta por Vox, con muchas referencias personales a su lider Abascal, parecia la intervencion del diputado de Vox una respuesta a aquella intervencion. Casado solo merecio defensa de un diputado independentista, quizas por no estar muy al tanto de las complejidades de la politica, donde se enzarzan dos partidos que unas veces estan en coalicion y en otras se declaran socios preferentes, para criticar al diputado de Vox que califico la propuesta del PP como "un conjunto de tonterias", lo que en su opinion nadie debe decir en la Camara.

The NFL is placing all teams in intensive protocol starting Saturday to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 as the number of cases rises around the country. Use of masks will be mandatory at all times at team facilities, including during practice and in weight rooms. Meetings must be held either virtually or in the largest indoor space with approval by the league. Meals have to be made available for grab-and-go to avoid players and staff congregating in cafeterias. Time spent in the locker room also has to be limited. Clubs operating under the intensive protocols have reduced close contacts by more than 50% since the fifth week of the regular season, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press that was sent from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to teams on Wednesday. “These sustained reductions and the resulting health and safety benefits make it appropriate to implement the intensive protocols on a mandatory, league-wide basis,” Goodell said in the memo. So far, 28 teams have entered intensive protocol at some point and 16 teams have done it more than once. “The upcoming holidays, beginning with Thanksgiving next week, will introduce new risks of exposure that we need to address now,” Goodell wrote. “Because we have a highly sophisticated program of daily testing, we know when the virus enters our facilities, which underscores the importance of contact tracing and other steps to minimize close contacts within a facility. \"Recent experience has highlighted the importance of minimizing high-risk close contacts; on multiple occasions, we have seen individuals identified on that basis test positive within a short time.

 To the editor:
 Like everything else these days, wearing a face mask has become a topic of hot debate. The Centers for Disease Control has published a poll taken in May that shows that 60% of people always wear a mask while out in public. Just 13% say that they often wear a mask in public. Yet, still 17% say they rarely or never wear a mask in public.
 Reports find that women are more likely to wear a mask than men. This may be attributed to women as a rule are in the role of caregivers. Men are likely to view the wearing of masks as a “sign of weakness.” Psychologically speaking, people naturally rebel against what they are told to do.

Police are investigating a shooting that occurred Tuesday on the University of West Georgia campus.
 At least one arrested individual has been confirmed by the University of West Georgia Police Department as a participant in the incident, during which no one was reported injured.
 Tre Cannon was identified by authorities as the person who fired the shots, and he was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.
 Cannon was also charged with criminal street gang activity, carrying weapon in school property as non-license holder, discharge of firearms on or near public highway or street, possession and carrying concealed weapon without license as a first offense, possession of firearm or knife during commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies, and possession, sale, and/or distribution of marijuana
 Police said the incident occurred on Tuesday, when three men were walking on the sidewalk along University Drive and one man, identified as Cannon, produced a handgun. Cannon fired at a vehicle exiting a parking lot on the campus of the University of West Georgia.
 Police said that the three men then ran to another vehicle, and fled.
 No injuries or damages were reported as a result of this incident and neither Cannon or any of the suspects were affiliated with the university. Their car was later stopped at a convenience store by a Carroll County Sheriff’s Office deputy.
 The incident is still under investigation, and is being conducted by the Carrollton Police Department, University of West Georgia Police Department and Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.
 As of Wednesday night, Cannon’s bond had not been set and he was in the custody of the Carroll County Jail.

Behind closed doors and with a raft of health safety measures in place, football's Indian Super League (ISL) will kick off here on Friday and become the country's first major tournament to be organised since the enforcement of a Covid-19 lockdown eight months ago.
 Former champions ATK Mohun Bagan and Kerala Blasters will start the proceedings with what is expected to be a blockbuster clash at the GMC Stadium in Bambolim, Goa.
 But the season's first biggest game will undoubtedly be the one between ATK Mohun Bagan and SC East Bengal in Fatorda on November 27, the two heavyweights renewing their more-than-a-century-old rivalry in a new avatar.
 ATK Mohun Bagan, playing in their first tournament after the merger of last season champion sides of ISL and I-League into one club, will start as the frontrunner for the title in the seventh edition of the lucrative franchise- based tournament.
   
   
 They have roped in some quality players like star India defender Sandesh Jhingan while retaining the core of last season champions ATK side such as Fijian international Roy Krishna who was on rampage against opposition defences.
 Roy was last season's joint-top scorer with 15 goals from 21 matches while also providing six assists. He was named captain in the final as ATK cruised to their third ISL title and will return as skipper of the newly-formed ATK Mohun Bagan outfit.
 FC Goa, who won the League Winners Shield last season to become the first side from India to qualify for the group stage of the AFC Champions League, will be hit hard by the departure of star forwards Ferran Corominas and Hugo Boumous.
 Both these players established themselves as feared goal scorers in the ISL over the years. They have, though, also added a few quality players and their knowledge of the home conditions will come handy in their bid to at least reach the play-offs stage.
 Former winners Bengaluru FC, under Carles Cuadrat, will be among the perennial favourites with an array of top Indian players and proven foreigners.
 Cuadrat has ensured that his key players from their 2018-19 title-winning squad are still around. Besides two-time Golden Glove winner Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and ISL's highest Indian goal-scorer Sunil Chhetri, the Spanish head coach has also managed to tie down defender Juanan and midfielders Erik Paartalu and Dimas Delgad.
 A number of their young and talented players have also been retained, including Ashique Kuruniyan and, most importantly, the high-quality Udanta Singh.
 Mumbai City FC are another side which will aim for at least a play-offs appearance after undergoing massive changes since last season. With Abu Dhabi- based City Football Group buying a majority stake in Mumbai City FC, the club has revamped the squad in a grand manner.
 The biggest name to have joined is head coach Sergio Lobera from FC Goa. Lobera led FC Goa to the final of the 2018-19 season, and was in charge for the large part of last season when the Gaurs cemented their place atop the league table. He has brought some high quality players from FC Goa in the form of Mourtada Fall, Mandar Rao Dessai and Hugo Boumous -- hero of the League with 11 goals and 10 assists in 15 matches.
 Newcomers Sporting Club East Bengal, under Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler, and two-time ISL champions Chennaiyin FC could be among the dark horses.
 The tournament, which will run from November to March, is being restricted to a single venue in view of the pandemic.
 As per the protocols shared with the cubs, everyone involved with the tournament will be required to provide daily health updates through an app especially designed for this purpose. All the teams have been staying in a bio-secure environment since their arrival in the coastal state.
 The 10 competing franchises have been divided into three groups with Group A comprising four teams and Group B and C consisting of three sides each.
 The ISL has also formed a central medical team and employed a League Hygiene Officer who will issue operational directives and ensure implementation of the same through the tournament.
 The ISL has also mandated that the clubs hire a Hygiene Officer of their own who will be in charge of ensuring the health and safety of the players/team officials throughout the season.

 As far as fixtures go though, a home clash against a West Brom side winless since their return to the top-flight and conceding a league-high 17 goals so far this season is the perfect match to provide a boost in confidence.

BLOOMINGTON - Jack Raymond Hubble, 68, Bloomington, died Nov. 14, 2020.      He was born Sept. 21, 1952, in Galesburg to Noble and Etta May (Young) Hubble.      Jack is survived by his wife, Jean (Howland) Hubble; daughters Marsha (Thom) Monson and Stephanie (Ron) McCuan; son Richard (Amy) Hubble; and grandchildren Kelby Monson, Jonathan McCuan, Madelyn Hubble, Kyle McCuan, Mason Monson, Micah Hubble and Lucas McCuan.      He was preceded in death by his parents; brother, Roger W. Hubble; son, Roger C. Hubble; and grandson, Matthew W. McCuan.      Jack attended Galesburg Senior High School until 1970. He married the love of his life, Jean Howland, on Oct. 21, 1972. Jack went on to graduate from Illinois State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree, get a CPA certification from the University of Illinois in 1985, and obtain an MBA from ISU in 2003. He practiced accounting in various locations until his retirement in 2016.      Jack was a very active member in his community, serving on several boards. He was involved with the Bloomington Day Care Center, the Moose Lodge and Prairieland Federal Credit Union. Jack was also known for being a "jack of all trades." His hobbies included his remodeling projects as well as going to beaches and floating on the river.      Most people's first impression of our father was one of fear. He was more than a little gruff, and could act like a seasoned jerk, but once they got to know him everyone loved him. Why? Because he would give you the shirt off his back. He would do anything within his power to help anyone and everyone, from financial advice to helping work on anything. If he didn't know how, no problem, he'd drink beer and help you figure it out. He was a sounding board; however, he loved adding his own opinion. "If it were mine..." was one of his favorite lines, but he always had great ideas. Not one project in any of our houses would've turned out the way it did without his help and input.      He spent his day working around his house, never completely finishing one project before moving on to the next, but that was part of his charm. He'd get there eventually. And if he didn't, he knew we would take care of it.      He showed all of us his love, and his love for our mom couldn't be questioned. A few OLB's may have been necessary, but there was no one else he wanted to spend his life with. He helped turn us all into the people we are today. Do we have our faults? Sure, and some of us have more faults than others, but we do what he taught us to do: provide. We, with the help of our amazing spouses, provide for our families and, most importantly, we learned that no matter what, we take care of each other. He was loved and will be missed.      An open house will be held from noon to 3 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 19, 2020, to celebrate Jack's life at the Moose Lodge in Bloomington. Memorial contributions may be made to the COPD Foundation and American Diabetes Association. CDC guidelines will be followed regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including limited the number of people allowed in the facility at one time to 25.

The recent Supreme Court order that ruled in favour of DoT on its interpretation of AGR asking the industry to pay dues as high as Rs 1.47 lakh cr with VIL to pay an estimated over Rs 53,000 crore which could deal the final knockout blow to the already battered telco. The company having clocked consecutive losses in all quarters since its merger announcement in 2017 reported the highest ever corporate loss in the country at Rs 50,922 cr in Q2 of the current financial year which is over 10 times higher than that of the previous quarter. The mammoth amount came as a result of making room for AGR provisioning of Rs 25,680 cr in relation to the additional statutory dues following the apex court ‘s order.
 Its rival Airtel too listed massive net losses of Rs 23,045 cr in the same quarter- highest ever during its entire tenure on the back of provisioning for its dues in line with Supreme Court’s order. It made an overall provisioning of Rs28,450 crore.Mukesh Ambani-led Jio, which stands better than the incumbents, posted net profits of Rs 990 cr in the September quarter.

Bolden said there was a question about his house being across the street from the town limits in 2008 and said the council annexed it between 2008 and 2010. He said he has lived there since 2004.
 “But now the town can’t provide evidence of that,” he said. “I guess it was never recorded. It should be in the council minutes, but the town can’t locate the minutes of the meetings back then. I was assuming I was in the town limits, and nobody from Town Hall ever told me I wasn’t.”
 Records show Bolden won the 2008 and 2012 elections unopposed. He did not seek reelection in 2016.
 Owens, retired from International Paper in Courtland, was seeking his fourth consecutive term as mayor when he finished second to Bolden in August. He defeated incumbent Billy Ray Young in 2008 and ran unopposed in 2012 and 2016. He also served as a council member since 1986.
 “My client is happy with the outcome of the mediation,” Owens’ attorney John Kimbrough of Moulton said.
 In an affidavit, prepared by Hillsboro Town Attorney Thomas Denham of Moulton on Oct. 15, Town Clerk Andrique Moore wrote she accepted Bolden’s qualification papers in July.
 “After inspecting the city maps, I realized Mr. Bolden did not reside within the city limits of Hillsboro,” her affidavit said. “I informed Mr. Bolden of this fact, however, and he said, ‘go ahead and put me in.’”
 She said after the conversation she called the League of Municipalities and “they informed me I did not have the authority to keep Mr. Bolden off the ballot. Therefore, I did allow him to qualify. It is my understanding that Mr. Bolden knew at the time of his qualification that he was not a resident of the Town of Hillsboro.”
 League attorney Rob Johnston said Tuesday that a court, not a town clerk, generally makes the ruling on a candidate’s eligibility.
 Bolden said Moore’s sworn statements are not accurate and she is trying to protect herself from any claims of wrongdoing.
 Tuesday morning, Bolden said he was “disappointed for the people of the town.”
 “In the end, their votes didn’t count,” said Bolden, 58. “As a former council member, I know the council is supposed to represent the people. I hate the council didn’t consider the residents in this matter.”
 He served on the council from 2008 to 2016.
 Bolden, youth minister at Wheeler Chapel Church in Lawrence County, said he was confident the council members would cast their votes the way the people voted. “Yes, I was expecting to win,” he said.
 He said he plans to focus on his family and church, where he has worked for 15 years.
 “I have a vision to move the town forward,” he said. “I plan to run again in four years because that’s what the people here want.”
 Owens did not return phone calls seeking a comment.

When he was interviewed in August 2019 for the job as Marywood University director of athletics and recreation, Patrick Murphy was asked by school president Sister Mary Persico, I.H.M., about his thoughts on esports.
 “I’m not going to pretend I am an authority on it,” Murphy said. “But I said to her that esports are not going to go away; they’re only going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. We don’t want to be the last ones to the party.”
 On Wednesday, Marywood joined the party. The university announced that it is will offer a competitive esports program, beginning in the fall 2021.
 Esports is organized video gaming where teams and individuals from schools around the nation compete against each other.
 Lackawanna College
 is among the schools in Pennsylvania that have an
 esports program. Others include Albright College, Arcadia University, DeSales University, Edinboro University, Harrisburg University, Juniata College, Kutztown University, Lebanon Valley College, Misericordia University, Penn College of Technology, Robert Morris University and Saint Francis University.
 Murphy gives all the credit to Persico for adding Marywood to that list.
 ”This is something that can enhance the college experience, not only for current students at Marywood, but also help us to reach out to potential students,” Murphy said. “Bring them to Marywood so they can compete in esports and get a quality education.
 “I think it was on Sister Mary’s radar before I even took the position here. This is really hers and the upper administration’s vision. My job is to just help make it happen.”
 A lot needs to be done to get the program started, including finding a space on campus and outfitting that space with the necessary technology. Perhaps most important of all is finding a program director and coaches.
 ”We need to do that sooner rather than later,” Murphy said. “I say that because I think we need them on board in the not-too-distant future so that they can help from a consulting standpoint of what we need to do next steps. So they can weigh in on everything. They have the know-how.”
 There also is finding a conference in which to compete. Marywood’s varsity sports teams are part of the Atlantic East Conference. The school also is a member of the East Coast Athletic Conference (ECAC), which Murphy said already has 89 schools with esports programs.
 Lastly, there is the question of what games to play.
 “We’re a Catholic university, so what games we pick kind of have to fit in to our identity,” Murphy said. “We don’t want to have violent games at a Catholic school.”
 Murphy said he already has spoken with a company that brands esports programs to make them attractive for potential students.
 “That’s very important,” Murphy said. “If you’re putting the work and investment in, you need to brand it the right way and give it that feel and look that the students will embrace.”
 He said he spoke with Lackawanna College about its Esports program. Plus, he talked to Kiernan Ensor, president of Conference One, a collegiate esports organization that launched in the fall. Ensor previously was the esports coach at Canisius College, a consultant for the Atlantic-10 Conference and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference esports coordinator.
 ”We have a pretty good idea of the next steps we have to take and where we want to go with this,” Murphy said.
 “We’re really excited to get going on this. We’re going to make a go of it and it’s going to be wonderful.”

Have you looked at the number of quarterbacks your height running the run- pass-option (RPO)? Guys like Russell Wilson, Kyler Murray and Tua Tagovailoa couldn’t have gotten a backup quarterback job 20 years ago.
 You have seen a shift in baseball as well, pun intended. The infield shift has essentially antiquated the ground ball hitter and its impact on the game has many fans calling for MLB to ban it.
 Steroids took the credit and blame for the massive increase of home runs in the professional game but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The influx of the long ball may have more to do with the infield shift and analytics proving that trying for four bases and getting it 10 percent of the time while often settling for less is better than trying for one base and getting it 33 percent of the time.
 Basketball has certainly evolved. Long gone are the days of post dominated teams as the sport has embraced the use of the three point line. They have come to recognize that like baseball and football, the risk is worth the reward. It’s now clear that the increased payoff of success derived from shooting beyond the arc more than offsets the increased risk of no payoff at all.
 Analytics and it’s impact on sports isn’t new. The talking heads on television have been talking their heads off about it since they got on television but what is new is just how effective it’s all become. The numbers arrived shortly after the computer did but for the first time in history there is a generation of athletes who have been training their whole lives to take advantage of these metrics and coaches who have been taught to properly use them.
 Evolution isn’t new either and because it’s natural and inevitable, resistance is futile. Sit back and enjoy the show.

When looking back at the beginning of the 2020 season, the Lake Havasu football team featured a young and inexperienced squad with only 11 seniors on its roster. With a lack of an offseason and no scrimmage, it was looking like a long season for the Knights after being outscored 33-100 in their first two games of the season.
 After a rough 0-2 start, Havasu went 4-1 in its next five games and will have a chance to avenge one of its early season losses when the Knights face Casa Grande in a 4A play-in game on Friday.
 Havasu (4-3, 3-1 Southwest) will travel as the No. 15 seed to play against the No. 2 Cougars (5-1) who routed the Knights 52-7 in week two of the season on Oct. 8. Havasu went on to clinch its spot in the 4A play-in bracket after a 64-22 win over Vista Grande last week.
 “From that second week of the season to now, we’ve grown and we still hit some bumps on the road too to refigure things out and made some tweaks along the way,” Knights head coach Karl Thompson said. “We feel that when we started the season to now, we made a lot of great in-season adjustments and feel like we’re a way more competitive team then we were in that week two.”
 It will be the Havasu’s first playoff appearance since 2015 and it’s also the first time in five years that the program ended the regular season with a winning record. The Knights’ last playoff run ended with a 17-14 loss to Pusch Ridge Christian Academy-Tucson in the semifinals.
 It will be the first time that players from this current team will face postseason competition with the exception of quarterback Donny Fitzgerald, who played in a playoff game in California in 2018.
 Defensive end Jon Justice, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament last season, is ecstatic about getting a taste of playoff action for the first time.
 “To make the playoffs is a dream come true for me because I haven’t gotten to do that my four years,” Justice said. “This is the first year that I actually won a home game since I played for varsity so just even that is exciting for me. Mentality this week is to work hard, get up and get ready for this game.”
 In the week two matchup, the Cougars went on to score 45 consecutive points after Havasu tied the game 7-7 in the first quarter on a 5-yard touchdown from Fitzgerald to Aaron Bracamonte.
 The Knights struggled to contained Casa Grande’s rushing attack, which ran for 376 yards and scored five times. Cougars’ running back RJ Keeton led the ground game with 139 yards on seven carries. Casa Grande quarterback Angel Flores carried the ball 10 times for 94 yards and two touchdowns. Flores also had an efficient game through the air, passing for 148 yards and three touchdowns on 9-of-11 pass attempts.
 In his second game at Havasu, Fitzgerald passed for 124 yards on 11-of-19 pass attempts and rushed for a season-low 15 yards on seven carries.
 The senior has seen all around improvement since that early season loss.
 “We’re a totally different team from when we played Casa Grande week two,” Fitzgerald said. “No only offensively, but defensively, special teams, we’re a different team. Our timing with our guys has gotten better on offense, me and receivers. Our lineman have gotten better.”
 Isaac Stopke only had four carries in that game for 1 yard. Since then, Stopke has been a breakout player for the Knights, rushing for 871 yards and 11 touchdowns during the 4-1 stretch to close the season. He also had a three- game streak of 200-plus rushing games after the loss to Casa Grande.
 The sophomore should make an impact this time around after finishing the regular season with the 15th-highest rushing total in the state. Stopke rushed for 926 yards in this year’s shortened season.
 “We know they’re not going to let us get anything easy,” Stopke said. “You’re not going to be able to run the ball for 200 yards against them. It’s going to be, you’ll get three yards and then you just have to keep pounding the ball. It’s not going to be an easy game. It’s going to take everything that we have.”
 Friday’s game is scheduled to kickoff at 7 p.m. Winners of this week’s 4A play-in games will advance to the 4A state tournament. Matchups for the 4A tournament will be announced on Saturday morning on the Arizona Prep 365 website.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.
 Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.
 Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

As we celebrate National Rural Health Day on Nov. 19, we cannot ignore how the healthcare landscape has changed in the past year. Who could have imagined we would be in the midst of a global pandemic, fighting a deadly virus that has changed the way we live? The reality of this pandemic has taught us many things, but one thing we have learned for certain is that now, more than ever, it is vitally important that we acknowledge the importance, and the role of rural hospitals.
 Lawrence Medical Center and its clinics provide care for our families, neighbors, and friends close to home. During the year ending 9/30/20, LMC admitted 466 patients, saw 6,887 patients in our Emergency Department, had 57,531 outpatient visits (Laboratory, Physical Therapy, Radiology, Respiratory, etc.) and saw 25,826 patients in our clinics. We also collected almost 2,000 specimens for COVID-19 testing.
 During a pandemic, like any emergency, every day counts, and, without rural hospitals, many Alabamians would lose access to essential healthcare services. We believe that our hospital plays a vital role as a cornerstone of this community, and we promise you that we take this role very seriously. Lawrence Medical Center takes pride in providing access to quality healthcare, and we are committed to delivering care to our community for years to come.

Coronavirus cases are set to reach their highest number in Arizona since early August, despite efforts by state health officials to mitigate the ongoing pandemic.
 Reported cases in Arizona have followed a nationwide trend in recent weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,984 new cases statewide as of Nov. 11, after a gradual upward trend that seemed to begin in September, when an average of fewer than 300 cases were reported.
 In Mohave County alone, almost 450 new cases have been reported within the first two weeks of November, according to state health department records. With 99 confirmed coronavirus cases per 100,000 Mohave County residents, and more cases reported each day, Mohave County reflected a growing number of cases nationwide.
 Gov. Ducey addressed Arizonans Wednesday afternoon in a press conference to address the trend in new cases.
 “It’s been eight months since I issued a public health emergency in Arizona,” Ducey said. “Many are asking when it will end … that’s not on the horizon. We remain in a public health emergency, and getting back to normal is not in the cards right now.”
 According to Ducey, the impact of the coronavirus has been felt throughout Arizona, and conflicting attitudes toward mitigation efforts have at times hindered those efforts entirely.
 “This has been a long haul,” Ducey said. “We are not out of the woods, and there are no ‘easy asks’. But this is my ‘ask’. There are two extreme camps out there. One wants to lock everything down, and the other thinks it’s all a hoax. Both have been loud and vocal. Most of the public aren’t part of either camp, and neither am I. But masks work. Please wear them.”
 According to statements from Arizona Department of Health Services Director Cara Christ, there have been substantial increases in new coronavirus cases. Masks and face coverings have proven an effective method of preventing transmission of the virus, Christ said, but recent CDC studies have also show that face coverings can also offer a layer of protection against possible infection as well.
 Masks are already a required measure at bars, restaurants, fitness centers and other venues throughout the state. Combined with mandatory social distancing measures, Ducey says Arizonans can reduce this month’s influx of new cases.
 Ducey announced Wednesday that $25 million would be directed by the Arizona Governor’s Office to support staffing at hospitals statewide. The funding will be used to reward existing direct-care employees and pay staff costs at Arizona healthcare facilities.
 “We’ve been communicating with Arizonans since February about how to mitigate the risk of spreading the virus,” Ducey said Wednesday. “We’re asking the public to be smart, be responsible and to follow the public health guidelines Dr. Christ has put together.”
 According to Ducey, however, Arizonans are no longer the only ones at risk.
 “Thousands of people are arriving from the Midwest, the East Coast and elsewhere,” Ducey said. “We’re amplifying our message to make sure every individual in the state knows what steps to protect themselves.”
 Arizona health officials are already working with airports in Phoenix, Mesa and Tucson to inform arriving travelers about the potential risks of coronavirus in Arizona, Ducey said.
 The governor, however, was optimistic for the potential release of coronavirus vaccines next year, from manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna. With a possible solution to the crisis apparently close at hand, Ducey on Wednesday issued an executive order to collect information in reference to those vaccines, and to identify those Arizona populations that need them most.
 “Today we learned that the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective,” Ducey said. “The Moderna vaccine is also 95% effective. Our task force is actively working to ensure there will be effective distribution of the vaccines when they are released.”
 Since the start of the pandemic, 283,102 Arizona residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, and 6,365 have reportedly died from coronavirus infection.

When generally speaking about the Northside Lady Bears basketball team, contending for a championship is usually at the center of conversation.
   
 That will indeed be the case again this season, especially with the Lady Bears returning two recent Division I signees with prior championship experience.
   
 Last week, 6-foot-5 senior point guard Jersey Wolfenbarger signed with Arkansas while 6-2 senior forward Tracey Bershers signed with Oklahoma State. Both are incoming four-year starters who were part of Northside's 2019 6A title team as sophomores.
   
 "We expect to contend for championships," Lady Bear coach Rickey Smith said. "We return the first and only four-year players in school history."
   
 But whether Northside can make it to Hot Springs for a championship game remains a mystery, and not just the competition on the court. The uncertainty remains whether a full season will get to be played due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "Our motto this year is to expect the unexpected," Smith said. "At any time anything can happen.
   
 "So we are trying to stay in the moment and just enjoy the opportunities we currently have."
   
 Along with Wolfenbarger and Bershers, the Lady Bears bring back 5-10 junior forward Haitiana "Yonni" Releford. Smith noted Releford lost 20 pounds in the off-season and is drawing heavy interest herself from various colleges.
   
 "We return some very experienced players and very talented players," Smith said. "But we have very little depth, and the depth we do have is very inexperienced."
   
 Other players Smith is counting on to pick up the slack are guards Jalyn Ford, a 5-6 senior, and Ashya Harris, a 5-7 junior. Khassidy Warr, a 5-9 junior forward, is expected to provide depth in the frontcourt.
   
 "Our team has been working very hard on the floor," Smith said. "I really do like the makeup of the team. This team really embraces our coaching staff's mentality."
   
 The Lady Bears opened their season Tuesday night with a road game at Jacksonville. They will go to Charleston on Thursday before returning home next Tuesday to face Melbourne.
   
 Grizzlies
   
 There may not be a transcendent talent on this season's Northside Grizzly basketball roster like a Tevin Brewer, an Isaiah Joe or a Jaylin Williams.
   
 It will also be a Grizzly team short on experience.
   
 But coach Eric Burnett is optimistic the team can coalesce come March.
   
 It isn't Burnett's first rodeo. Three seasons ago, he lost four starters off his 7A state title squad save for Joe, and the Grizzlies made it back to the championship game.
   
 So can the Grizzlies quickly reload again?
   
 "The keys to this year is how well we come together as a team, believing in one another on and off the floor," Burnett said.
   
 "We do not have many varsity players with experience. ... We just have to play games for these players to get some experience together."
   
 One of the few returning players Burnett has at his disposal is senior Jacob Joe, a 6-1 guard. Burnett likes what he has seen from Joe thus far.
   
 "I look for Jacob to be a great leader for us this year," Burnett said.
   
 In fact, Joe is one of several guards that give the Grizzlies an advantage at that position.
   
 "We have some guards that can shoot the ball well," Burnett said.
   
 That also includes 6-0 junior Sundquist Church, 6-1 junior Ian Hardwick, 5-10 senior Avonte Tucker, 5-9 senior Keate Rose and a pair of six-footers in senior Connor Coats and junior Sam Roper.
   
 On the frontcourt, the Grizzlies are relying on 6-7 senior Jordon Wright and 6-4 junior Walker Catsavis, along with a pair of newcomers in 6-9 senior Tamaury Releford and 6-4 sophomore Denarion Whitmore.
   
 The Grizzlies opened their season last week with a home win against Subiaco Academy. They played at home again Tuesday night, facing Little Rock Hall.
   
 "We have some really good games to get us ready for conference play," Burnett said.
   
 Mavericks
   
 Southside's boys also won't be quite as experienced as the Mavericks were last season. But second-year coach Stewart Adams believes the team can be a more balanced unit.
   
 "We feel we are a more balanced team this season; our overall shooting ability is more spread out," Adams said. "We will miss the consistent scoring of Mykale Franks from last season, but we feel like we can have multiple guys who can hurt you this year.
   
 "Our bench is deeper this season, and we have a great mix of senior leadership and young energy contributing this year."
   
 The Mavs' lone returning starter is Josh Merrell, a 6-5 senior post who averaged five points and five rebounds a game as a junior.
   
 "Josh is a smart player who knows our system well, and offers some defensive and offensive stability," Adams said.
   
 Some reserves last season who are expected to get increased playing time include six-footers Caiden LaRoche and Ethan Vaughn, along with 6-4 Tristan Lane.
   
 Newcomers to watch include 6-4 Ki Kolls and 6-foot Xander Naegle, both juniors.
   
 Yazed Taforo, a 6-foot sophomore guard, and Levi Steele, a 6-4 sophomore forward, may also see some minutes.
   
 "We have a great group of kids to work with this year," Adams said. "This is a close knit group that expects to work hard each day.
   
 "We feel pretty good about playing 10 or more guys a night, and we could get scoring from anybody each night. We have a group that is experienced in our system both offensively and defensively, so we feel like we will be more efficient on both ends of the floor."
   
 Southside played at Siloam Springs on Tuesday night. This Thursday, the Mavs travel to West Fork.
   
 Lady Mavericks
   
 Last week, the Southside girls basketball team got to experience something they hadn't felt the previous two seasons, a post-game winning locker room.
   
 Though it was a benefit game, a win against Talihina (Okla.), the Lady Mavs were definitely not giving it back. Now they want to win some more ballgames.
   
 "We are very young and inexperienced; there are no players on this team that have more than one season of varsity experience," second-year coach Robert Brunk said. "Even with that, these girls compete everyday in practice.
   
 "We start the season with some really tough opponents, but everything is different with this team compared to last season. The energy level that these girls bring to practice each day has been something that has been nice to be a part of this preseason."
   
 Among the key players for the Lady Mavs are Ashlyn Roffine, a 5-8 senior, along with 5-1 junior Essynce Norwood, 5-8 junior Jaida Ndungu and 5-10 junior Addi Branham.
   
 Brunk also has a promising crop of newcomers, including 5-4 junior Keyairra Johnson, 5-6 sophomore Iana Perry, 5-7 sophomore Tinsley Freeman and Sierra Smith, a 5-7 freshman.
   
 "As a team, we have thus far been able to handle things well," Brunk said. "As soon as we were able to start practicing this summer, the girls started showing up and working to improve their game."
   
 The Lady Mavs will play at West Fork on Thursday and go to Van Buren next Tuesday.

"Cut the mustard" test


--DocBreak--
A few days after the election last week, when things were still a bit murky, I made an offhand remark to some friends about what kind of hat I should crochet for the march that would be taking place the day after Joe Biden’s anticipated inauguration.
 Of course, we won’t be needing any hats. There will be no throngs of women parading down the avenues of big cities like Washington D.C., New York and Philadelphia with needlework replicas of genitalia on their heads.
 That is so 2016, that super-spreader therapy session for pre- and post- menopausal liberal women, because the ladies are happy, happy, happy! The great grabber is gone, and the blinding light of Biden’s suspiciously perfect dental work will chase away the darkness in the valley.
 Biden does seem to be the winner, despite Donald Trump’s legitimate attempts to figure out whether the 600,000-vote margin in Pennsylvania melted away due to actual votes or because some deceased residents of Philadelphia rose up, like characters in the “Spoon River Anthology,” and filled out ballots.
 I am prepared to accept the election results, although I find the election to have a fishy, unpleasant smell to it, much like the odor which emanates from the Potomac swamp and never disappeared under Trump’s administration.
 In the days following the election, as the numbers and margins changed and morphed with each passing hour, Democrats separated into two distinct camps. On the one side were those who sought harmony, peace, conciliation and kumbaya. Biden and his running mate placed themselves on that side of the blue line in the sand. They are the squishy, albeit touchingly naive ones, who think that after four years of vilifying people who don’t agree with them they can extend an olive branch.
 But it’s the other camp that interests me more, the one that has no problem being open and in-your-face about its agenda. On Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez led the charge by suggesting the left should make up lists of those who had supported Donald Trump, in order to make sure that history did not forget what they had done and to ensure that they were no longer in a position to cause “harm” to others.
 That sentiment was echoed by others on the left, including once respected public figures like former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, who said there should be a “Truth and Reconciliation” commission similar to the one established in South Africa after Apartheid ended. The obvious implication was that supporters and “enablers” of Donald Trump should be held accountable for their alleged crimes. Sen. Elizabeth Warren suggested that the Justice Department might want to set up a task force to target former Trump administration officials, and the so called “conservative” Lincoln Project tweeted out a photo of two of Trump’s election attorneys with the comment, “Let’s make them famous.”
 You might say that anyone who either worked for or assisted Trump is fair game in the business and political world. A Washington Post reporter wrote a snarky article about how former Trump allies might want to update their resumes to make them more palatable for future employers. You might even think that the public harassment engaged in by those who listened to Rep. Maxine Waters is hunky dory. Having been born below the Mason Dixon line I will take a phrase from my southern ancestors (I must have some) and say, “Bless Your Heart.”
 But what you cannot legitimately do is support the compilation of lists, the establishment of “commissions,” the creation of task forces and the doxxing of private individuals who legitimately believed that they were advancing political goals that – let’s be honest – were supported and shared by a large plurality of the American public. You cannot do that and pretend to be Americans. And if you are capable of deluding yourself into feeling virtuous while persecuting others, I’m thinking you were that kind of person well before Donald Trump descended that escalator six years ago.
 So to those who are seeking reconciliation, good luck with that. And to those who are seeking Truth and Reconciliation commissions, you got a good look at what the #Resistance looks like when you were marching with those genitalia hats on your heads. This time, though, the #Resistance will be much better dressed.

Behind closed doors and with a raft of health safety measures in place, football's Indian Super League (ISL) will kick off here on Friday and become the country's first major tournament to be organised since the enforcement of a Covid-19 lockdown eight months ago. Former champions ATK Mohun Bagan and Kerala Blasters will start the proceedings with what is expected to be a blockbuster clash at the GMC Stadium in Bambolim, Goa. But the season's first biggest game will undoubtedly be the one between ATK Mohun Bagan and SC East Bengal in Fatorda on November 27, the two heavyweights renewing their more-than-a-century-old rivalry in a new avatar. ATK Mohun Bagan, playing in their first tournament after the merger of last season champion sides of ISL and I-League into one club, will start as the frontrunner for the title in the seventh edition of the lucrative franchise- based tournament. They have roped in some quality players like star India defender Sandesh Jhingan while retaining the core of last season champions ATK side such as Fijian international Roy Krishna who was on rampage against opposition defences. Roy was last season's joint-top scorer with 15 goals from 21 matches while also providing six assists. He was named captain in the final as ATK cruised to their third ISL title and will return as skipper of the newly-formed ATK Mohun Bagan outfit. FC Goa, who won the League Winners Shield last season to become the first side from India to qualify for the group stage of the AFC Champions League, will be hit hard by the departure of star forwards Ferran Corominas and Hugo Boumous. Both these players established themselves as feared goal scorers in the ISL over the years. They have, though, also added a few quality players and their knowledge of the home conditions will come handy in their bid to at least reach the play-offs stage. Former winners Bengaluru FC, under Carles Cuadrat, will be among the perennial favourites with an array of top Indian players and proven foreigners. Cuadrat has ensured that his key players from their 2018-19 title-winning squad are still around. Besides two-time Golden Glove winner Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and ISL's highest Indian goal-scorer Sunil Chhetri, the Spanish head coach has also managed to tie down defender Juanan and midfielders Erik Paartalu and Dimas Delgad. A number of their young and talented players have also been retained, including Ashique Kuruniyan and, most importantly, the high-quality Udanta Singh. Mumbai City FC are another side which will aim for at least a play-offs appearance after undergoing massive changes since last season. With Abu Dhabi-based City Football Group buying a majority stake in Mumbai City FC, the club has revamped the squad in a grand manner. The biggest name to have joined is head coach Sergio Lobera from FC Goa. Lobera led FC Goa to the final of the 2018-19 season, and was in charge for the large part of last season when the Gaurs cemented their place atop the league table. He has brought some high quality players from FC Goa in the form of Mourtada Fall, Mandar Rao Dessai and Hugo Boumous -- hero of the League with 11 goals and 10 assists in 15 matches. Newcomers Sporting Club East Bengal, under Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler, and two-time ISL champions Chennaiyin FC could be among the dark horses. The tournament, which will run from November to March, is being restricted to a single venue in view of the pandemic. As per the protocols shared with the cubs, everyone involved with the tournament will be required to provide daily health updates through an app especially designed for this purpose. All the teams have been staying in a bio-secure environment since their arrival in the coastal state. The 10 competing franchises have been divided into three groups with Group A comprising four teams and Group B and C consisting of three sides each. The ISL has also formed a central medical team and employed a League Hygiene Officer who will issue operational directives and ensure implementation of the same through the tournament. The ISL has also mandated that the clubs hire a Hygiene Officer of their own who will be in charge of ensuring the health and safety of the players/team officials throughout the season.

 Global drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday that their COVID-19 vaccine was found 95% effective in the final analysis of the Phase 3 trial, including in people aged over 65 years, paving the way for the companies to apply for emergency authorisation from US regulators within days.
 Further, Pfizer and BioNTech said they have concluded phase 3 study of their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate BNT162b2, meeting all primary efficacy endpoints.
 Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.

I am imagining a personal letter I would send to the new Coronavirus Task Force that has been assembled by the incoming administration of President- Elect Joe Biden.
 President Trump, who built his brand on being America First, needs to now truly put America first, end his stubborn refusal to concede and allow the new coronavirus task force to get to work. But as they do, I thought I would list a few suggestions for them to bear in mind.
 First off, know that there has been bi-partisan cheering of the long-awaited news that an effective virus vaccine has been developed by several pharmaceutical producers including Pfizer and Cambridge-based Moderna, and, amazingly, will be made available to essential workers within weeks.

On Parler and in a Facebook post he has since deleted, White referred to vice president-elect Kamala Harris as a “Hoe.”
 White also shared an image this week on Facebook, which he has deleted, calling for Democrats to be hanged.
 In recent weeks, White has engaged with several posts on Parler and Facebook that falsely state President Donald Trump won reelection and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory is fraudulent.
 In a now-deleted Facebook post, he mentioned “the deep state” and said it was “attempt(ing) to control every aspect of your life.”
 White didn’t respond to an interview request Wednesday.
 Gianforte, who is friends with White on Facebook, hasn’t spoken publicly about his appointment. His campaign also didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday.
 White has come under fire for his posts. The Montana Post, a liberal blog, wrote an article on Tuesday that criticized White’s posts. Several people have commented on White’s Facebook page asking why he deleted some of his more controversial posts.
 During the 2019 legislative session, White chaired the House Natural Resources Committee and served as a member of the House Taxation and Fish, Wildlife and Parks committees.

 In issuing the county’s first official public plea over the pandemic, the chairman of the Mesa County Board of County Commissioners, Scott McInnis, is asking residents to do what needs to be done to control the coronavirus, including refraining from putting themselves into close contact settings, staying away from confined spaces that have poor ventilation and avoiding being in the midst of large crowds or other places with a lot of people nearby.
 McInnis said his hope is to forestall more places from having to shut down or seeing access limited to a higher degree because of an even greater increase in COVID-19 infections over the next few weeks.

Trade is a recurring issue in both the leaked list and other official Chinese statements. Despite Australia on November 15 joining other Asia-Pacific countries in signing the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)—a move which China’s Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen claimed “sends a strong signal against unilateralism and protectionism, [and] strongly supports free trade”—the two nations have been at loggerheads on trade issues for all of 2020. China has targeted the coal, barley, and cotton industries, and Australian winemakers fear that an unofficial Chinese embargo on importing Australian wine could effectively neuter the $1.26 billion export industry. Beijing's list of issues with Australia seem to stem mostly from Morrison’s call for an investigation into COVID-19’s origins.

Not all opinions are free. If you pay for an opinion, there's no evidence it's worth more.
 The Bonneville Power Administration hired some experts to study why adult salmon don't return to spawn . According to expert opinion, most fish get lost in the ocean.
 The Astorian reports that fish from every river on the West Coast have been going missing. It's a developing story, and a growing mystery. If it's not those dams after all, are successive generations of hatchery stocks just plain dumb? Have we been breeding their brains out?
 My smoke alarm went off when I saw that this fresh narrative was first picked up by the Capital Press, where truth comes straight from the horse's mouth. Examine any issue, and you will find all things newsworthy are grounded in support of Oregon's rural economy. Pass me some oats.
 History records that in 1942, when the Grand Coulee Dam was completed, fish runs collapsed in the vast reaches of the upper Columbia. By 1967, with completion of the Hells Canyon Dam, runs in the upper Snake River basin were extinguished.
 I witnessed firsthand evidence of this fading bounty, as seen by the slow and tortuous decline in the local commercial salmon fishery. I remember the noon whistle from Columbia River Packers Association, and I roamed the floors of Union Fish cannery.
 Uniontown's docks were built to buttress a working waterfront, not a place where boutique beer joints flourish by picking upon an extinct fishery's bones.
