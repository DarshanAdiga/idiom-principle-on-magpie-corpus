Sports Ruins The Bundle, As Usual
 At close to or maybe even a little above $35 per month, that leaves just $5 for all the other channels in TVision Live. Considering that YouTube TV hiked prices $5 two years ago when it decided that it would bite the bullet to add Turner networks to its lineup, that's probably the last of Live's budget right there, for TNT and TBS. Even if you think they're cheaper than the full $5, what about Fox's sports nets, NBC Sports Network, and all of Fox's and Comcast's other cable nets?
 The last argument might be that some of the channels I just listed are only available in TVision's Live+ tier, giving T-Mobile an extra $10 per month to cover them. Fair enough, but that tier also includes the Big Ten Network, the NFL Network - which alone cost $1.67 per month three years ago - and most importantly, Comcast's regional sports networks (though not Sinclair's, which have been left out in the cold by yet another pay-TV distributor.)
 How much do the RSNs cost? Put it this way: AT&T (T) now charges a $10 RSN fee on its DIRECTV/U-Verse bills. After Comcast signed the Chicago Cubs' new Marquee Network in Chicago, it raised the local fee all the way to $14.45! Even if we cut the numbers in half, to reflect the lack of Sinclair's RSNs - not every TVision customer will have an RSN in their area - and the variances among different cities, very little is left to help cover the shortfall in the core Live package. In fact, Live+ might even be an extra dollar or two underwater. We have not counted the operating costs of the service yet, either, but let's stop here. I think the point has been proven.
 The only saving grace here might be non-wireless subscribers. T-Mobile has already signaled it intends to charge higher prices to non-wireless subscribers, how much higher exactly we don't know. The discount last time for wireless customers was $10, and it wouldn't surprise me to see the "non- customer surcharge" stay around the same ballpark. At that higher price, T-Mobile would probably be able to generate at least a little gross margin on non-wireless subscribers and help defray these expenses.

_Abu Dhabi, 20 nov 16:15 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- La compagnia aerea emiratina Emirates si sta preparando per trasportare i vaccini contro il Covid-19, mentre le case farmaceutiche si muovono per affrontare le sfide logistiche poste dalla loro distribuzione. La compagnia di Dubai, in particolare, ritiene di poter svolgere un ruolo importante nei prossimi mesi, quando il vaccino contro il coronavirus sarà prodotto in quantità massicce. “In uno scenario in cui il vaccino per il Covid-19 dovrà essere conservato a temperature estremamente basse, i produttori includeranno anche packaging contenente ghiaccio secco per mantenere i vaccini alla temperatura necessaria”, ha detto un portavoce di Emirates SkyCargo. Per parte sua, Emirates sarà in grado di fornire nel suo hub a Dubai “servizi di ri-refrigerazione, per mantenere i vaccini alla temperatura richiesta per un periodo di tempo maggiore. (Res)

The first deal brought speedy German guard Dennis Schröder to the Lakers from Oklahoma City in exchange for McDaniels’ draft rights and swingman Danny Green.
 Schröder, who averaged 18.9 points per game with a career-high 38.9% shooting on 3-pointers for the Thunder last season, seems an ideal fit with the Lakers to provide complementary scoring and steady ball-handling that can take pressure off LeBron James.
 The Lakers agreed to the trade earlier this week, but couldn’t announce it until immediately after the draft ended because NBA teams aren’t allowed to trade their first-round picks in consecutive seasons, which meant the Lakers had to make the pick for the Thunder. Los Angeles already sent last year’s first-round pick to New Orleans in its trade for Anthony Davis.
 With Schröder secured and many decisions still to make, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka declined to buy a pick in the second round, even though the team’s scouting department has a strong history of finding solid talent outside the top of the draft.
 In the previous five drafts alone, Los Angeles selected or acquired seven current NBA players chosen outside the top 20: Larry Nance Jr., Ivica Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Moe Wagner, Isaac Bonga, Svi Mykhailiuk and Talen Horton- Tucker. They subsequently moved all of those talents except Horton-Tucker, who earned a ring last month, as assets to build a championship roster.
 The Lakers had already traded their own second-round pick, the 58th overall, to Orlando for Horton-Tucker’s draft rights last summer.
 Los Angeles must assemble most of its roster in the next two weeks before training camp begins in its title defense season, and Pelinka apparently decided against adding any guaranteed money to the payroll.
 The futures of Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, JaVale McGee, Markieff Morris and Jared Dudley are all up in the air. Caldwell-Pope, McGee, Rondo and Bradley can decline player options in their contracts in favor of unrestricted free agency, while the 34-year-old Howard is a free agent likely to get interest around the league after his impressive bounce-back season.

Full approval of a vaccine will likely take several more months, and the vaccine makers are not expected to complete that step until spring or summer.

"Our guys really wanted to turn things and get back on track," Carroll said. "And even with all of the situations, with all the guys in and out in the lineup and all that, it just didn't matter. Guys played really well across the board."
 Wilson was flawless, erasing the mistakes from the past four weeks when Seattle dropped three of four, including losses in the past two weeks to Buffalo and the Los Angeles Rams. The skid left Seattle in a tie atop the NFC West with the Rams and Cardinals.
 For a few days at least, Seattle (7-3) will be back on top alone until the Rams play on Monday night against Tampa Bay. It was an important victory for the Seahawks heading into the softest part of their schedule, with four upcoming games against teams with a combined 8-28-1 record.
 Wilson was 23 of 28 for 197 yards and TD passes of 25 yards to DK Metcalf and 11 yards to Tyler Lockett in the first half. Wilson had committed 10 turnovers in the previous four games combined, a stretch that started with Seattle's 37-34 overtime loss to Arizona in Week 7.
 Lockett, who had 15 catches for 200 yards and three TDs in the first meeting with Arizona, had another nine catches for 67 yards.
 But the biggest boost for Seattle was the return of its run game. Hyde had a 2-yard TD run in the third quarter, and Seattle finished with 165 yards rushing.
 "It helped balance our offense out today," Hyde said. "We was able to hit passes, run the ball, move down the field. You know, how we play."
 Murray and DeAndre Hopkins couldn't rekindle the magic from their last-second touchdown to beat Buffalo last Sunday. Murray was 29 of 42 for 269 yards and two TDs, but Seattle was able to get the kind of pressure on the QB that was missing from the first meeting.
 "They definitely played for me in certain situations but like I said, we put up 21, had a chance to win the game at the end, but throughout the game, we started slow and kept shooting ourselves in the foot," Murray said.
 And that pressure came through in the closing seconds. On fourth-and-10 at the Seattle 27 with 38 seconds left, Dunlap got around the edge and tackled Murray for his second sack of the night. Seattle finished with three sacks and seven QB hits after not touching Murray in the first meeting.
 "(Pete) was fired up. He almost tackled me on the sideline. That was crazy to see a head coach that involved," Dunlap said.
