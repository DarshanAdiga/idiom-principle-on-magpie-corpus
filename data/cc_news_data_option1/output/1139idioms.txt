It was then time for Chiltern to lay the outbound shore end ready for the run to Suez, but this did not start out well. While Chiltern was paying out the shore end, the turn of cable paying out from the tank caught under two turns of the lower flake, “and in an instant the three were twisted together in an inextricable knot.” This tangle, known as ‘a riding turn’, tore away the bell mouth and part of the wooden framework leading to the cable trough, and the test room reported loss of continuity at the same time. After cutting out the damage and re-splicing the cable, the electricians found that while the cable on board ship had good continuity, there was a total loss of insulation to the shore. While they were trying to determine the cause, a boat from shore brought a message that, “At five minutes past eight A.M. (Greenwich), the cable suddenly disappeared through aperture, and has not been seen since.” [Note: The ship’s logs were maintained in GMT throughout the voyage] Before the Chiltern could be brought to a halt, the massive increase in tension caused by the cable jam had resulted in the end of the cable being dragged out of the cable house. A boatload of men was sent on shore, whereby digging three feet deep into the sand and towards the sea they discovered the missing end sixty feet from the cable house.

Ministries like RightNow Media, which has tremendous online discipleship resources, have begun to make their content available online for free. People can find the comforting words of scripture on almost any device, thanks to YouVersion. Using these great Bible studies coupled with Facebook groups or Zoom, we can continue to provide excellent discipleship opportunities for our communities. Just because we can't meet face to face doesn't mean the Church gets a pass on our obligation to be the ministering hands and feet of Jesus, offering hope, life, and love to a hurting world. For years, persecuted Christians in the Middle East have had to resort to using the digital Church as their only means of gathering and worshiping freely without fear of death or persecution. Now, their ministry experience presents tremendous learning opportunities for churches in the West to learn just how to build an authentic, Christian community online.      Churches across Europe are beginning to grapple with the difficulties of conducting services, particularly funerals, in an age where people cannot gather and find closure, comfort, or a shoulder on which to cry. Even at the most conservative of estimates, the reality is that almost every Church in the country may very well experience at least someone they know who is sick with the virus. Pastors may even be called on to conduct funerals virtually in the coming weeks and months ahead. We cannot afford not to build the type of community online that provides comfort to the hurting, peace to the distressed, and hope to the hopeless.

On 6 November 1869 Great Eastern left England’s Portland Harbor destined for Bombay, carrying 2,375 nautical miles of cable. Her companion ships, the Hibernia, Chiltern, and Hawk, held a further 1,225nm, making a total of 3,600 nautical, or about 4,140 statute miles. Great Eastern alone had on board 5,512 tons of cable, 3,824 tons of fuel, 6499 tons of coal, and apparatus and appliances, making up a freight of 21,000 tons in weight, and including the ship, a total value of about £2 million. The route to India was via Madeira, St Vincent, Cape Town, Assumption Island, and past the Seychelles to Bombay, where the ships of the expedition arrived on 26 January 1870 after a voyage of almost three months. It is reported that the ship burned an average of 200 tons of coal per day, having taken on an additional 3,000 tons at Cape Town.

 FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Spring training returned right on time in mid-February. The Boys of Summer were back in town.
 Aahhh, the familiar smell of popcorn and hot dogs wafted through the grandstands. Fans enjoyed some Buds with their buds and talked about their favorite players. Relaxed Red Sox players signed autographs and chatted with fans.
 All that changed on March 12. That's the day the commissioner shut down our National Pastime. Current score: coronavirus 1, baseball 0.
 Here in Fort Myers and from Tampa to Tempe, there is crying in baseball. The gates were locked and the players were told to go home. Those same stands at JetBlue Park are now empty and aroma free. It's a dark day in Florida and Arizona.
 Players were told they could stick around and use the Sox training facilities. A day later, though, Major League Baseball switched gears and told most players to go home.
 JetBlue Park was suddenly a ghost town. It's March. There's supposed to be the crack of the bat, not dead silence!
 Every February and March since 1993, when the Red Sox moved to Fort Myers from Winter Haven, thousands of New Englanders have come here to watch their heroes. Many bought homes here -- Florida is a tax friendly state and has no state income tax.
 Snowbirds fly or drive to Lee County, which is halfway between Tampa and Miami on Florida's west coast. It's a place where nearly 700,000 people make their homes. About a quarter of a million of them are part-timers who escape the snow and ice for a few months.
 It used to be you would rarely see a license plate from Massachusetts or Rhode Island or Maine, etc. When I first came here in 1987, most of the out-of-state plates were from Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Not anymore.
 The Red Sox are one of the most popular teams in Florida. Since moving to JetBlue in 2012, they have sold out every game -- 135 in a row. Incredibly, since coming to Fort Myers in 1993, it's been standing room only in all but one of the 249 home Grapefruit League games. They played for 18 years at City of Palms Park near downtown before moving 10 miles southeast into the new ballpark that was patterned after Fenway.
 For a time it appeared that major league players might return to their spring training sites. Originally, MLB said there would be a two-week delay to opening the season. A few days later a new start date was announced -- the second week of May. Realistically, no one has a clue when baseball will resume.
 Spring training is a significant financial boost for Florida and Arizona. Each year fans head south and west, bringing fat wallets and families in tow. A recent study showed that baseball visitors to Fort Myers alone spent nearly $70 million on their spring training visits. In the survey, of nearly 1,200 of those questioned, 50 percent said their primary reason coming to Fort Myers was for spring training.
 In other words, this area is taking a big financial hit since about half of the Grapefruit League schedule was canceled. People checked out early from their hotels, heading back to Pawtucket and Worcester and Hanover and all other parts of New England. Also gone from the area's economy are meals eaten at restaurants, beers guzzled in pubs and all the other places vacationers spend their money.
 Fort Myers is the most unique spring training city in baseball. There are actually four major league spring training parks here. The newest is JetBlue.
 There is Hammond Stadium, about five miles west of JetBlue and home of the Minnesota Twins, who came to town in 1991. City of Palms was built for the Red Sox and opened in 1993. Today, it's home to Florida Southwestern College's baseball team.
 And there is Terry Park on the east side of town. Built in the early 1920s, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics trained there beginning in 1925. The Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals also trained there. This spring a Korean Baseball League team used the ballpark.
 On the flip side of this national emergency, baseball fans have endured strikes, a canceled World Series, the Black Sox, cheating scandal, great teams, lousy teams.
 Baseball will be back this year this (we hope), but probably not here at JetBlue Park.

 COLCHESTER -- In light of recommendations from the CDC and orders from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, Colchester Mayor Frances Welch has decided to close Colchester City Hall until April 1.
 The announcement was made effective Wednesday evening, March 18. In order to keep up with water bills, City Clerk Donna Wetzel said a drop box is available to receive bills, and that city employees will still be working each day as normal.
 The drop box will also be available for those looking to sign up for Summer Ball, the city's summer baseball and softball organization. A Summer Ball Facebook post read that sign-up events planned for Thursday and Friday, March 19 and 20, had been postponed as well to an undetermined date. These events were to coincide with parent/teacher conferences at local schools, which were also cancelled.
 Summer Ball was among one of two committees to meet on Monday, March 16. Building and Grounds, the second committee, failed to meet due to no quorum. Two members were missing: Aldermen Will Terrill and Mike Eddy. Terrill was reportedly unavailable due to an unrelated illness, while those at the subsequent Summer Ball meeting said Eddy had chosen not to attend that evening's meeting in accordance with President Donald Trump's advice to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.
 Mayor Welch said on Monday that March and April were when her committees typically assembled their budgets for the next year, and added that her committees would continue meeting as scheduled. On Wednesday, coinciding with state-wide school and business closures and tightening restrictions on group gatherings, Welch changed course and announced that meetings would resume April 6, providing more than two weeks for committee members and concerned citizens to participate in social distancing.
 Colchester plans to hold its regular city council meeting on April 6 at City Hall. It is unclear whether this will be affected by Pritzker's tentative \"Shelter In Place\" order, expected to go into effect on Saturday, March 21.

As far as testing for COVID-19 goes, he said, the regulations around testing have been frustrating. Until a few days ago, if a doctor in the emergency room suspected a patient of having the coronavirus, he or she would have to notify the Public Health Department, which would send someone to assess the patient and determine if a test was necessary.
 While that may be changing, he said, there still aren’t nearly enough tests for everyone who might have the virus — and even if there were, the doctor added, it’s not clear how much good that would do since many people are asymptomatic.
 “We do have to be judicious,” he said. “In a perfect world, we have innumerable tests. But still, the only reason to test everybody is if you want to scientifically determine the percentage of people carrying it, and that’s going to do us no good right now. Right now, we need to focus on the sick.
 “We do have a limited number of tests,” he added. “We don’t have enough, so we should save it for the sickest people to make sure that if they do have the coronavirus, we isolate them.”
 One problem that St. Mary’s faces, though, is a lack of blood.
 “That’s a big problem,” he said. “We are so short of blood because people aren’t donating.”
 The doctor said the hospital isn’t using that much more blood than usual at the moment, but the supply has dried up. So, he said, people looking to help should donate blood.
 But overall, the message the doctor gave was that his hospital and the rest of the staff are prepared for what’s to come.
 “It’s stressful, but we’re going to be okay,” he said. “The most important thing to know in terms of COVID-19 is that we are doing the right thing right now for Long Beach.
 “We are all on the same page,” the doctor added. “We’ve got this.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first rapid coronavirus diagnostic test, with a detection time of about 45 minutes, the test's developer, California-based molecular diagnostics company Cepheid, said on Saturday.
 Cepheid said in a statement it had received an emergency use authorization from the FDA for the test, which will be used primarily in hospitals and emergency rooms. The company plans to begin shipping it to hospitals next week, it said.
 The FDA confirmed its approval in a separate statement. It said the company intends to roll out the availability of its testing by March 30.
 Under the current testing regime, samples must be sent to a centralized lab, where results can take days.
 "With new tools like point-of-care diagnostics, we are moving into a new phase of testing, where tests will be much more easily accessible to Americans who need them," U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said on Saturday.
 The diagnostic test for the virus that causes COVID-19 has been designed to operate on any of Cepheid's more than 23,000 automated GeneXpert Systems globally, the company said.
 The systems do not require users to have specialty training to perform testing, and are capable of running around the clock, Cepheid President Warren Kocmond said in the statement.
 The company did not give further details or say how much the test will cost.
 The U.S. FDA has been pushing to expand screening capacity for the virus while the World Health Organization has called for "order and discipline" in the market for health equipment needed to fight the outbreak.

Tom Brady has traded in his Patriots logo for one with a pirate. That's only one of many differences about to come for the future Hall of Fame quarterback.
   
 Brady will go from playing inside Gillette Stadium with its signature 130-foot high lighthouse behind the north end zone where the militia fires off celebratory musket shots. Now, his home will be Raymond James Stadium with its signature 103-foot long replicate pirate ship behind the north end zone where replica cannons fire off after each score.
   
 After signing a two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Friday, Brady will be starting a new chapter in his life next season.
   
 So, what exactly is he getting into?
   
 Between playing in the NFC and having new coaches, a new system and new teammates, Brady is about to enter a whole new world.
   
 Coaching
   
 If you're looking for an opposite of Bill Belichick, Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians is a good place to start.
   
 First, Belichick is a defensive-minded coach who started to flourish as the New York Giants defensive coordinator in the 1980s. Arians is an offensive- minded coach. He became popular as an offensive coordinator with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts.
   
 Then you have their demeanor. We all know that Belichick is a no-nonsense, business-like head coach. He treats everyone the same and isn't always viewed as a players coach. But he's the best of all-time. Arians is known as a players coach. According to ESPN's Jenna Laine, Arians greets everyone with "Hey babe," and wants to have beers in the parking lot after games. So, we're talking about polar opposites.
   
 Then there's the offensive scheme that Arians runs with offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich. Arians' offense pushes the ball downfield with deep passing plays. That's how Jameis Winston threw for more than 5,000 yards in 2019. With the Patriots, Brady has been running a modified Erhardt-Perkins offensive system. Receivers and tight ends utilize option routes and typically uses the run game to help set up the pass with play-action fakes.
   
 Arians already told NFL Media's Mike Silver that him Brady will "probably meet in the middle" when it comes to the Bucs system.
   
 Wide Receivers
   
 Brady has to be salivating at the thought of playing with receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.
   
 Evan is a 6-foot-5, 225-pound deep threat. He's coming off his third Pro Bowl season (2016, 2018 and 2019). He also made the NFL's second-team All-Pro squad in 2016. In six NFL seasons, Evans has six seasons of 1,000 receiving yards. Last year, in just 13 games, he caught 67 passes for 1,157 yards and eight touchdowns.
   
 Godwin is a 6-1 dynamic slot receiver. He's the type of target that would've been ideal for Brady in the Patriots system. Last year, he was named to the Pro Bowl and was a second-team All-Pro for the first time in his career. The 24-year-old had a breakout season in 2019, catching a career-high 86 passes for 1,333 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.
   
 Evans and Godwin were two of the most productive receivers in the NFL last season.
   
 It'll be interesting to see what the Buccaneers do offensively in addtion to their two star wideouts. It was reported on Friday that Tampa Bay is trying to bring back Breeshad Perriman. A 6-foot-2 speedy deep threat, Perriman caught 36 passes for 645 yards and six touchdowns last season as the Bucs' No. 3 receiver.
   
 Tight Ends
   
 Brady will play with two veteran tight ends whio have had varying degrees of success. He's not exactly getting Rob Gronkowski, but the cupboard isn't bare.
   
 O.J. Howard, 25, was one of the top tight ends in the 2017 NFL Draft. He was fairly productive in his first two NFL seasons -- 432 yards and six touchdowns in 2017 and then 565 yards and five touchdowns in 2018. Last year, however, wasn't great for Howard. He finished with 34 receptions for 459 yards and one touchdown. The lack of production led to trade speculation and it was reported that the Patriots called Tampa to inquire about Howard.
   
 There's also Cameron Brate. The 28-year-old has been a solid red-zone target for the last six seasons for the Bucs. He averaged just over six touchdowns a season from 2016-2018. He also had a down year in 2019, catching 36 passes for 311 yards and four touchdowns.
   
 Offensive Line
   
 A big part of Brady's success comes from pass protection. As we've seen in a couple of Super Bowl losses to the New York Giants, if you want to disrupt Brady, get to him early and often.
   
 Brady is heading to a team where the offensive line play will need to improve. According to Football Outsiders, Tampa Bay had a pass protection ranking of 23 out of 32 teams. The Pats last season were ranked ninth. In 2019, Winston was sacked 47 times. Brady was sacked 27 times. The most he's been sacked in a single NFL season was 41 times and that was in 2001.
   
 Tampa Bay entered this offseason needing to replace right tackle Demar Dotson. They signed Joe Haeg on Friday.
   
 Running backs
   
 Another area the Buccaneers will need to improve is their run game. In 2019, Tampa Bay ranked 24th in the NFL in total rushing (1,521 yards), averaging 95.1 rush yards per game.
   
 Last year, their leading rusher with Ronald Jones (724 yards and six touchdowns) and Peyton Barber (470 yards and six touchdowns). Jones led Bucs running backs with 31 receptions for 309 yards.
   
 They also need to make sure Brady has a reliable pass-catching running back. Throughout the years, that's been a staple for Brady. He worked wonders with James White over the last five seasons. Prior to that, it was players like Shane Vereen, Danny Woodhead and Kevin Faulk.
   
 It'll also be interesting to see if any former Patriots try to join Tampa. One option is Dion Lewis, who was released by Tennessee this offseason.

“It was determined to effect the splice on the Chiltern, which was lying by the shore-end buoy, some 200 yards astern; and the delicate operation was proceeded with at once. After the heavy shore end was picked up from the buoy, and a portion of the cable on the Great Eastern passed over her stern and on to the Chiltern’s deck, the laying each line open, the fusing the two slender copper cores, the melting and smoothing down by hand the layers of gutta- percha, the application of Chatterton’s compound, and the final closing up and re-twisting of the thick protective coil, occupied some hours, and it was a quarter past four P.M. before Mr London pronounced the splice complete. The chief of the Telegraph Construction Company’s electrical staff on board the Great Eastern, Mr Laws, sent messages through the entire line and to the shore long before this, and within a few minutes of the two copper wires being fused.”

With all of the uncertainty surrounding the current crisis, one thing churches and pastors can be sure about is that streaming your online service is simply not enough. As ministers of the Gospel, we have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to shepherd and care for the people that God has entrusted to us. Thankfully we live in the digital age where technology can be the most important tool at our disposal. Even a few weeks ago, the idea of the digital Church was a mystery and was also scoffed at by many as an inferior expression of the Body of Christ. That was before the Corona outbreak took its rapid escalation globally.      As more and more Americans are requested to isolate themselves, the Church must not have a defeatist mentality; rather, we should view this as an opportunity that could potentially position the Church for its greatest evangelistic growth in generations. People are scared and confused; anxiety abounds; this is where we have the chance to share the words of Christ and encourage the people not to fear. This is also the time for Christians to remind each other that not only do we serve a risen Savior, but we also serve the great Physician. Realistically, now is also the time for Churches to prepare prudently for the coming days ahead. Loneliness and isolation can be dangerous breeding grounds for depression. Shortages in stores also present an opportunity to love our neighbors in new and unprecedented ways. Now is the time where the Church can really be the good Samaritan to the communities we have been called to serve.
