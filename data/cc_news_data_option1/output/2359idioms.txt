The text messages, which were obtained by The Associated Press, were from a group chat involving Janicek and five other people, including the female staffer. At one point, he wrote that he had argued with her and then asked whether the campaign should spend money on “getting her laid."
 “It will probably take three guys," he wrote, before describing in graphic detail an imagined group sex scene involving the female staffer.
 He then tried walk back those comments as “a joke," and texted an apology to the group.
 “I'm going on no sleep and a bunch of exuberant excitement and I think I was out of line," he wrote.
 The female staffer texted back that she was appalled by his comments and could no longer support his campaign.
 “You are my boss and a candidate running for Senate, (an) office held by just 100 Americans representing approximately 330 million of her people," she wrote. “There is zero tolerance for what you said."
 Party officials said they demanded that Janicek withdraw as the party's nominee, which he refused to do.
 The campaign staffer, who has since quit, filed a formal complaint with the party alleging that Janicek violated its code of conduct that prohibits sexual harassment.

The government has been forced to defend the work of Mr Hilakari's brother Mat, a convener of Mr ­Andrews' Socialist Left faction, amid suggestions he spent his days on party matters. He works for Mental Health Minister Martin Foley and as an adviser to federal MPs ­Julian Hill in Bruce and Peta Murphy in Dunkley. Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said the claims represented further evidence that the government would "stop at nothing to ensure it tightens its control over Victorians".
