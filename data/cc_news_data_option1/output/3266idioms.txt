Obama's necklace was crafted the day after Koop direct-messaged Cuthbert on Instagram, out of the blue, in late July. The two had never previously met, nor had they worked together, yet Koop had taken note of Cuthbert's designs on social media. Cuthbert had made a limited supply of VOTE necklaces for herself and friends in 2016, and in 2018 to raise awareness about the primaries, and she intended to do so again in anticipation of 2020's presidential election. The timing of Koop's request was fortuitous.

Little Elaina Cox of Kewanee has had a tough introduction to the world.
   
 Born in April amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she has spent the first few months fighting for her life after being diagnosed with cancer while still in her mother's womb.
   
 "When she was a week old, doctors confirmed that Elaina has neuroblastoma," said Melanie Cox, the baby's mother. "Her DNA index-1 came back with no copies, causing doctors to recommended chemotherapy as treatment."
   
 Melanie said Elaina was a miracle for she and her husband, James. The couple had struggled with fertility issues with their first child, 3-year-old Savannah, but the pregnancy took more quickly this time after doctors had suggested a fertility treatment.
   
 She said the beginning of the pregnancy was filled with joy, with Savannah getting to go with mom to see her baby sister on the ultrasound. But then the joyful time was interrupted by COVID-19, causing visitor limitations and reducing the family's ability to be involved.
   
 "It took a personal, family oriented time and turned it into a time that was stiff and cold and sad," she said.
   
 And at 33 weeks into the pregnancy, more bad news came after Melanie went in for the usual growth checkup. The Coxes knew something was wrong: The ultrasound technician had noticed an anomaly and multiple doctors were called in to review the ultrasound.
   
 But there wasn't much time to be frozen from worry. The family was immediately sent to a high-risk OB in Iowa City, who told them that baby Elaina had a tumor. In less than a week after the growth checkup, the tumor had nearly doubled in size, causing doctors to perform an emergency C-section.
   
 By then, COVID-19 was raging and continued to make an already horrifying situation worse. Once Elaina was moved into intensive care and new mom Melanie was discharged from the hospital, only one parent was allowed into the hospital at the same time. When the parents received news about their daughter's condition, one was receiving it over the telephone.
   
 "When you're there and you are surrounded by all of these doctors and oncologists and nurses and surgeons and they want to tell you news about your baby's future, you know that's hard," Melanie said. "For (her dad]) to have to conference in on the phone call hearing your baby has cancer is hard."
   
 The Coxes also have had to manage the family dynamics of having a 3-year-old who doesn't understand her baby sister has cancer.
   
 "(She) doesn't understand why I can't stop to get her a drink because I am feeding Elaina," Melanie said.
   
 She said they've been given advice for how to help Savannah mentally process the situation that includes special books and a stuff duck with a chemotherapy treatment port like Elaina "so that she can see what is."
   
 She said the family has received lots of support from family and friends, as well as donations from residents of gas and restaurant cards, to help the family navigate it all emotionally and financially.
   
 And despite their lives being turned upside down in a year that no one will forget, the support has brought them peace and allowed them to make Elaina as comfortable as possible as she prepares for her final treatment - and then hopefully a life filled with potential.
   
 "We have been pretty lucky," she said of the outpouring of support.

I’ve heard that life passes in seven-year cycles. The theory is that humans tend to make major changes as each of these periods comes to a close. I have to say I find the argument holds water, especially in regard to child development.
 It seems like yesterday that I first held my daughter in my arms, but in reality, I recently sent her off to her first day of first grade. She has her own opinions now, and she rarely hesitates to voice them. It’s a habit that keeps me on my toes. I’m also noticing more distinct traits that seem to be here to stay.
 For instance, she’s always been creative. She loves to draw, as do I. She suddenly seems to notice shapes and proportion in the same ways that I do and at the same rate. We were tubing down the Cartecay River near my parents’ cabin recently, and we floated over a small rapid. As the tube spun around in the ensuing eddies, we had a good view of the tiny falls, and I took note of the way the water resembled glass as it smoothed over the rocks and then plunged into an expanding froth of bubbles and foam.
 The simple, curving mirror of the rapid against the curlicues of the whitewater put me in mind of a piece of art deco furniture.
 “Look at that!” my daughter exclaimed as the thought passed through my mind.
 “Did you notice that shape?” I asked.
 “Yeah! It was pretty!” was the response.
 I tried to develop the conversation and tell her about my impression, but she had already moved on and was pointing at a flock of Canadian geese on the water ahead.
 I, however, stored that interaction away for further reflection later.
 Another time recently, we were hand grazing one of our horses, a newly acquired gelding. He is a warmblood with show experience in his past, and portions of his musculature speak of years of careful training. As he stretched down for grass, my daughter exclaimed over the elegant bend of his bay neck and the ebony fall of mane that set off the distinctive shape.
 “Oh, that’s pretty!” she said.
 I had also admired the smooth curve that suddenly appeared as the gelding reached his chiseled head forward, but I wanted to make sure we had seen the same thing, so I asked what caught her eye. She pointed to the horse’s neck and explained that she saw a long oval in the gracefully articulated arch. I saw it, too, after she described it.
 It occurred to me in both of those moments how strange a thing it is to shepherd someone from a state in which they are totally dependent on you for sustenance and protection to a time when the two of you can have the same impressions and can, on however limited a basis, discuss that experience. It’s also a gift to realize that a part of me is being carried forward, and I don’t think it’s a result of any active effort. My daughter seems to have inherited my tendency to see enchanting shapes in natural things, and it’s a joy to share those perceptions with her.
 These seven years have passed like the blink of an eye, and time actually seems to be speeding up as my children get older. I feel what I believe is a natural tendency to cling to the past — the tiny shoes, the baby blankets, the adorable outfits … but I sense the future is approaching quickly and that I cannot control the passage of time. And so, I also remind myself to stay present today as much as I can.
 I have a good idea of what the next seven years will bring as I look back at my own childhood and I see my friends’ children grow, but I also wonder what sparkling little surprises there will be. What similarities in personality, both to their adult family members and to each other, will my children shock me with, and what differences will enchant me? I look forward to and hope for many more years of discovering life in these details.

The Floyd County Board of Elections heard complaints Tuesday about the Aug. 11 runoff but pushed back a full discussion to a later date.
 Instead, the three-member citizen board officially certified the results to send to the state, then went into a closed session to discuss personnel. No action was taken.
 Problems during last week's Republican primary runoff, including errors in the voting cards and delayed openings, led to an emergency court order keeping the precincts open until 9 p.m. Combined with late reporting of the results, it has sparked concerns about the county's readiness for the Nov. 3 general election.
 Poll worker Virginia McChesney said during the Tuesday public comment period that one polling place opened two and a half hours late, which she said was unheard of.
 Board member Melanie Conrad said they've been discussing ways to tackle the technical issues, including setting up what she termed a "geek squad" to handle any sort of equipment malfunctions on election day.
 Local NAACP president Ouida D. Sams talked to board members about the need for the community to be trained on using the new machines. There had been some demonstrations for the community to participate in when the elections office first received the new equipment, but Chair Dr. John Rees said not many people turned out for those sessions.
 "We all have to be working together," Sams said.
 Conrad and the other board members said they're planning to hold more training sessions for poll workers in the coming months and will specifically address issues from the primary and runoff at the sessions.
 Floyd County Commission Chair Scotty Hancock said that the commission fully supports the board and elections office -- but he also touched on some of the problems that were seen on election day, including the card errors.
 He said the county commission is ready to help in any way they might need, whether it is more training, more funding or more poll workers.
 "We appreciate the volunteer board and the work that you do," he said. "We're here to help and support you. We're a resource."
 Hancock also said that the commission will begin looking for a new location for the elections office to make it more "customer-service friendly." However, it won't happen until after the November election.
 "I can assure you that, after this election, that will be a priority for the county," he said. "We'll relocate the office from downstairs (in the County Administration Building) and give it a storefront where we'll have the ability for parking."
 Larry Morrow also questioned the board about when absentee ballots will be sent out for the Nov. 3 election.
 Chief Elections Clerk Robert Brady came off hostile as he said the latest they will be sent out is Oct. 12. While Morrow argued that Georgia law states that local elections offices can issue absentee ballots as early as Sept. 15, Brady kept going back to the Oct. 12 date.
 After a brief back and forth between the two, Conrad and board member John Scott Husser clarified that the ballots will be sent out once they are completed.
 Former election board member Steve Miller said he believes the board is doing a good job and that the social media complaints are "partisan." Miller went on to say that the card malfunctions were because of the vendor and that no one in the room was responsible for the problems.
 Right before the board adjourned, Rome City Commissioner Wendy Davis pointed that they did not discuss the problems from the Aug. 11 election. Rees said they will discuss the matters and official numbers at the next regularly scheduled meeting in September.
 After the meeting, Davis said she "continues to be disappointed that the elections board is not being upfront about the problems of the conduct of the last two elections."
 "I had the expectation today that they would say that the runoff would not meet the standards that they expect... and they haven't stepped up and showed leadership or responsibility. I think our community deserves better."
