One such retailer, CPW, a women’s clothing store, has been in business for 30 years on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. A three-month shutdown resulting from the virus meant the store retained only 20% to 30% of its sales as the owner, Linda Wolff, packed and delivered orders to customer homes. Though CPW reopened for curbside pickup a week ago, Wolff said she hasn’t rung up a single such sale.

"Everybody's starting from scratch, being out three months. I think it sort of levels the playing field. All teams are going to be healthy for the most part. Everybody's had time to heal bumps and bruises and injuries. I like our chances, I think we're still a pretty young team, we're an exciting group," Landeskog said.

Last Wednesday, the Recording Academy announced changes for next Grammy Awards, including renaming the “urban contemporary” category to “progressive R&B.” Stemming from long-time criticism the Recording Academy has received for use of the term “urban,” the move is also in reaction to recent protests against police brutality and systemic racism targeting the Black community.
 “Progressive R&B” makes more sense from a practical standpoint than “urban contemporary,” (urban contemporary is not a real genre of music and was a term coined in the radio industry when marketing to particular audiences). R&B can be progressive in terms of style and sound, but to music fans it’s so niche of a genre that when used by the Grammys it immediately strikes as tone deaf. At first read of this change one might think they’re reading satire on brand’s rampant empty symbolism and half-hearted attempts at showing solidarity in standing against racial injustice.
 The newly renamed category will “highlight more progressive elements of R&B and may include samples and elements of hip-hop, rap, dance, and electronic music. It may also incorporate production elements found in pop, euro-pop, country, rock, folk and alternative,” according to a statement by the Recording Academy.
 Besides its incorrectly specific naming, the category opens up a wide range of sounds to be considered for nomination, which would be exciting on paper, but in the hands of the Recording Academy it’s more likely Black artists on the forefront of new sounds have only been pushed farther into a corner.
 Even with Tyler, The Creator at the Recording Academy’s own event speaking openly on inclusion for Black artists in white dominated categories and acknowledging the box Black artists are consistently thrown into, the best they can do is a name change. If anything, the Recording Academy is further exposing their inability and/or unwillingness to listen.

Forward Jeff Skinner struggled in a second-line role, finishing with 14 goals and 23 points a season after signing an eight-year, $72 million contract.
 The decision to fire Botterill came a few days after defenseman Lawrence Pilut, a restricted free agent, caught the Sabres off-guard by leaving the team to sign a two-year contract to play in Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.
 Botterill took the brunt of criticism for getting little in return when trading unhappy center Ryan O'Reilly to the St. Louis Blues in July 2018.
 None of the three skaters acquired by Buffalo in the trade has made much of an impact at the NHL level. Forward Patrik Berglund abruptly left the Sabres a few months into his first season and had his contract terminated by the team.
 In Botterill's defense, he inherited a disjointed mix of a team put together by his predecessor, Tim Murray. The Sabres' farm system also lacked NHL-ready depth as a result of a series of poor drafts and questionable trades.
 Adams is a former NHL player who grew up in the Buffalo area and spent the past nine years working for the Sabres in various capacities.
 Kim Pegula, who also serves as Sabres president, most recently said she's been leaning on Adams' expertise in helping her oversee the franchise.
 "We are confident Kevyn and Ralph (Krueger) will work together to build a consistent contender," the Pegulas said.

Antibody testing will indicate if the donor's immune system has produced antibodies to COVID-19, regardless of whether or not they developed symptoms, according to the Red Cross. Donations will be tested using samples pulled at the time of donation and sent to a testing laboratory where they will also undergo routine infectious disease testing. A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity.

"At the end of the day I work for the Colorado Avalanche and it's what I love doing and it's my job and dream to play in the NHL. We're going to have to trust the NHL and NHLPA that there's going to be protocols in place that we're all safe and in an environment that gives us as much freedom as possible, but at the same time being safe," Landeskog said.

Young announced her resignation in February 2019 to take the post of director of the New York State Center of Excellence for Food and Agriculture at Cornell AgriTech in Geneva.
 The Senate had been the GOP’s last grasp on power in state government, having controlled the chamber for much of the previous century.
 Now, Democrats control 40 of the Senate’s 63 seats, a comfortable majority that would be difficult to overturn in a single election cycle. They are led by Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers.
 All 63 Senate seats are on the ballot this fall. Nine Senate Republicans, including Flanagan, are not seeking re-election.
 In a statement, Ortt said the state needs a “conservative, battle-tested fighter” leading the Senate Republican conference.
 “Our country, our state, and our party are worth fighting for,” he said. “I look forward to making the case to my colleagues of how I can lead our conference forward.
 At least two other potential candidates to succeed Flanagan — Sens. Fred Akshar of Endwell, Broome County, and Joseph Griffo of Rome — declined to enter the race, with Akshar throwing his support behind Gallivan.
 “I am grateful for those who have approached and encouraged me to consider the Minority Leader position,” Griffo said in a statement. “I understand the importance of the role and believe that I have the skill set necessary and have demonstrated the abilities needed to lead the Senate’s Republican Conference. However, after contemplation and reflection, along with family obligations, I have decided that I shall not seek nor accept this leadership position.”
 Flanagan, meanwhile, will become Northwell’s vice president of regional government affairs in Suffolk and eastern Nassau counties, according to the health care system.
 He is legally barred from lobbying his Senate colleagues for two years.

It's been several years since I was in the Marine Corps. On Nov. 25, 1995, I was honorably discharged and joined the ranks of "1st Civ Div." I had been to Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm with the 8th Marine Regiment; Turkey for training operations; Twentynine Palms, California, for back-to-back Combined Arms Exercises; Puerto Rico on the USS Nassau; and the Bahamas (because the USS Nassau needed repairs). I also spent three years at Recruiting Station Twin Cities. My time in the Marine Corps was a great six-and-a-half years, and I think about it every day. It showed me the importance of having a positive attitude, being able to persevere, not tolerating excuses and several other characteristics that have undoubtedly contributed to my success in business. These characteristics helped me survive several hurricanes, monumental floods, economic downturns, and extreme highs and lows throughout my post-military career.

HOUSTON (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court granted a reprieve Tuesday to a Texas inmate scheduled to die for fatally stabbing an 85-year-old woman more than two decades ago, continuing a more than four-month delay of executions in the nation’s busiest death penalty state during the coronavirus pandemic.

Why, in 2020, are the fundamental civil rights of human beings still seen as controversial?
 Great strides have been made to ensure equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community, but there is a long way to go. For example, transgender people are still banned from serving in the military. The Trump administration is still arguing that adoption agencies should be able to reject gay couples. Transgender people do not receive the same treatment as cisgender people when it comes to public restrooms and accommodations or school sports and programs. The LGBTQ+ community still faces discrimination in housing, health care and treatment in prison. Nearly one in five hate crimes in our country are motivated by anti- LGBTQ bias. These are all issues that have no place in 2020 and need to be addressed by concrete legislation.

The sides have exchanged proposals digitally, with an occasional video conference. They have not met in person since March 13-14 in Arizona.
 "Everyone here wants to get down to business as soon as possible and play games. From what I've discovered, the holdup is not about the number of games or money at this time," Levine said. "The commissioner has the right under the March agreement to schedule the games as long as the players are paid 100% prorated. The holdup, as I understand it, is about resolving the other items in the March 26 agreement."
 "They include final agreement on all of the health and safety protocols, deciding what happens if a season is interrupted by a second wave of the virus, which players can opt out and under what circumstances can they, and a host of issues like that."
 Union head Tony Clark said Saturday additional talks would be "futile." Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Monday the season with in jeopardy.
 Since Friday, MLB Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem and union chief negotiator Bruce Meyer have exchanged letters that appeared to be preparation for possible litigation.
 "I've been talking to the commissioner on a daily basis. He has been and continues to be dedicated to play a 2020 season," said Levine, who was MLB's chief negotiator from 1995-97. "We all recognize that the players are the heart and soul of the game. I've called them patriots in the past and I believe that today."
