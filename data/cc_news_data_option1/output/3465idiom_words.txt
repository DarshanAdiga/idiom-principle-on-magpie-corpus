The Sussexes worked alongside students in the school's garden and spent time talking with them about nature and healthy eating, according to the Assistance League of Los Angeles, which runs the preschool.      Harry and Meghan were seen in photographs kneeling down to interact with the preschool students at their level and getting their hands dirty in the garden, just as Princess Diana was known to do at engagements with kids.      Harry has remembered Diana as "one of the naughtiest parents" who "smothered" him and his brother Prince William with love.      "She was our mum. She still is our mum. And of course, as a son I would say this, she was the best mum in the world," Harry said in the 2017 documentary "Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy." "She smothered us with love, that's for sure."      "She was very informal and really enjoyed the laughter and the fun," Prince William said in the same documentary. "But she understood that there was a real life outside of palace walls."
