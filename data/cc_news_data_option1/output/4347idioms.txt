If having an extra screen in your house would annoy you, the Google Nest Mini makes another good smart home starting point. Google's small smart speaker is now in its second generation and offers all of the same Google Assistant- enabled voice commands as the rest, plus helpful extras like intercom functionality and stereo pairing with multiple Minis. Control compatible gadgets, search the web, play music and more just by asking. The audio quality of the Nest Mini is surprisingly good, especially in this second gen model.
 The Nest Mini is also cute and comes in four colors. At $50, it's the least expensive way to kick off your smart home without any sacrifices in voice control. The Nest Mini also makes for a good secondary device. If you put a Google Nest Hub in your kitchen, you can put a Nest Mini in a different room, and both will be able to control any compatible smart devices you set up. Even if they both hear you, only the closest one will respond.

Dalla norma sono dunque eclusi i condannati per terrorismo, mafia, corruzione, voto di scambio, violenza sessuale, maltrattamenti e stalking, e chi è già stato sottoposto o lo sarà dopo l'entrata in vigore del decreto a contestazioni disciplinari per disordini rivolte e sommosse. Viene inoltre previsto il divieto di scioglimento del cumulo di pena per reati associati a mafia e terrorismo. L'allontanamento dal domicilio è punito a titolo di evasione con pene detentive più elevate della pena da scontare (un anno nel minimo e tre anni nel massimo, senza considerare i casi di evasione aggravata), il che fa ritenere improbabile la violazione della restrizione domiciliare.

CHESTER, S.C. (AP) — A DNA sample taken from a South Carolina man after his arrest for pointing a gun while drunk has cracked a long-cold case, identifying him as the lead suspect in the slaying of a woman four decades ago, according to court documents. Charles Ugvine Coleman, 65, was arrested last week and charged with murder and rape in the killing of Elizabeth Ann Howell Wilson, who disappeared after her shift at a textile mill on March 20, 1976, officials said. South Carolina law required Coleman's DNA be collected and sent to state officials after his arrest in April, because pointing and presenting a firearm is a felony punishable by at least five years in prison if convicted at trial. He was also charged with using a firearm while under the influence. Coleman pleaded guilty in Union County in September and was sentenced to 2 1/2 years of probation, with seven years in prison suspended. Then, the DNA results came back, linking him to evidence found after Wilson's body and vehicle were discovered in Fairfield County, The Herald of Rock Hill reported, citing court documents and police. Wilson worked at a mill in nearby Chester County. Now Coleman could get a life sentence if convicted in the murder case. Coleman's lawyer, public defender Mike Lifsey, said his office plans its own investigation into the case and Coleman is presumed innocent. Coleman has convictions dating back to 1975, according to records. Records show that in 1977, Coleman was sentenced to 12 years in prison for Chester County convictions for assault and battery with intent to kill, housebreaking, and larceny.

After winning the 1984 Allan Cup Canadian senior hockey championship against a formidable Cambridge Hornets side, at the friendly confines of the Fort William Gardens, the 1985 version of the Thunder Bay Twins needed to forge a different path to another national crown.
 Finishing middle of the pack in the Manitoba-based CASH League, the players on the ‘85 squad still knew they were in good hands under general manager Gary Cook and head coach Ron Busniuk.
 Trailing to both the Morden Bombers and St. Boniface Mohawks in the playoffs, the steady force of Cook up top, and Busniuk behind the bench, paid dividends as Thunder Bay went on to claim the Pattison Cup league title.
 Despite a few bumps along the way, the players knew they had what it took to continue succeeding.
 “The key to coming from behind was we remained calm,” recalled Twins defenceman Gerald Bolduc. We each had a job to do. We didn’t panic; felt we could always score enough to win and as the games went on, we seemed to get stronger.”
 That certainly would be needed in the Patton Cup western final as the Twins welcomed a familiar foe to the Gardens for a best-of-seven affair.
 Having defeated the Spokane Chiefs in Washington State a year previously to win the west, their opponents arrived in the Lakehead this go-round with revenge on their mind.
 For a while, it looked like they would do just that as Spokane surged out to a three games to one lead.
 Despite another deficit, Bolduc recalls how Busniuk deftly pulled all the right strings on the bench, helping to get the Twins back in it and eventually prevail.
 “Ron would mix and match lines, keeping an eye on who had that extra reserve of energyand using them to full capacity,” Bolduc said. “He was simply masterful in getting the most out of each and every player on the team. He quietly would go with what, or who, was working that game and always seemed to make the right decision.”
 Rallying for a pair of home ice victories, the club bounced back yet again as they forced a seventh and deciding affair at the Gardens.
 In front of a jam-packed throng of over 5,000 faithful, the late Gerry Cizmar shovelled in a backhander at the top of the crease, off a Wally Presenger feed, with linemate Brant Kiessig driving hard to the net, during a third period power play to give the Twins the lead and an eventual 5-4 triumph to cap off the come from-behind triumph.

 # Detroit singer secures spot on NBC's 'The Voice'
 Maureen Feighan
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 A Detroit singer with a silky smooth "Motown" sound will compete on this season of "The Voice" after being tapped to be a part of crooner John Legend's team during Monday's episode on NBC.
 Rio Souma, 28, performed Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "Cruisin'" as part of the blind auditions for "The Voice." Three of the four judges turned their chairs to add Souma to their team.
 "Rio, you have an incredible gift," said judge Kelly Clarkson. "You took a song that is a classic to this real place. The thing that impresses me most is when vocalists go to places I just wouldn’t think of. It just makes for a very intriguing performance because not many people are capable of that."
 Souma, who describes himself as a singer-songwriter, called Monday's experience "surreal."
 "But as surreal as it feels, it is just a daily reminder that God is real and he is able," said Souma in a post on Facebook. "And so are you."
 During his audition, Souma said he was inspired to sing by the 1993 movie, "Sister Act 2."
 Legend said "Cruisin'" is one of his favorite songs but when Souma sang it, "you made it truly your own. "
 "You are a phenomenal vocalist," said Legend. "I would love to be your coach."
 "The Voice," now in its 19th season, airs Mondays and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on NBC.

Not everyone needs a giant microwave. A lot of people simply don't have the space. At a small, but practical 1.1 cubic feet, this 1,000-watt model is more than capable of handling most tasks.
 Measuring 20.3 by 12 by 15.6 inches, it won't take up tons of counter space. You'll still get plenty of presets, including Dinner Plate, Frozen Vegetable, Beverage, Popcorn, Baked Potato, Pizza, Time Defrost and Weight Defrost.
 It performed satisfactorily in all of our tests, passing thresholds for temperature and doneness in most scenarios. It feels a bit like a Jack of all trades, master of none microwave. Totally capable, yet unexceptional in design or results. However, if space is an issue, Magic Chef's microwave will get the job done with a minimal footprint.

If you're looking for a budget pick with plenty of space and power, this 2.0-cubic-foot Oster model is the best microwave to buy. At $90, you won't have to break the bank to get a good microwave.
 With 1,000 watts of power, it can handle large entrees and thick potatoes alike. This Oster model performed exceptionally well in Popcorn mode, leaving just an average of 11 kernels unpopped. That's the best of all the models we tested.
 It also includes a Beverage function that heated water to a toasty 200°F. A simple, flat-front design and stainless border means this microwave isn't an eyesore.

Over two months later, the moment _Below Deck_ fans been waiting for is here: the part of the _Below Deck Mediterranean_ reunion where we finally find out what happened with chief stew Hannah Ferrier’s firing. Or try to, anyway. After last week’s part one of the reunion found Ferrier defending herself after being away for the back half of season five, the second half of the reunion focused largely on the actual circumstances of her firing for having Valium and a CBD pen on board. And was it CBD, anyway? Host Andy Cohen teased last week that the manufacturer told Bravo that Ferrier’s model was a THC pen, although Ferrier claimed she used CBD oil in it. Whether her castmates believed her was another question, but the conversation quickly turned to boatswain Malia White’s decision to report Ferrier to Captain Sandy Yawn. Ferrier explained to White that her doctor sent a letter to producers 12 hours after she left listing her prescription, and an onscreen note confirmed the letter.

To be sure, if early results on election night show Biden with a strong lead even in traditionally Republican states such as North Carolina, Florida, or Texas, Trump would find it much harder to contest the result for more than a few days, and he would concede sooner. The problem is that anything short of a clear Biden landslide will leave an opening for Trump (and the foreign governments supporting him) to muddy the waters with chaos and disinformation as they maneuver to shift the final decision to more sympathetic venues such as the courts.

The _new_ Wyze Cam
 Not to be confused with the $50 battery-powered Wyze Cam Outdoor, the new indoor-outdoor Wyze Cam relies on an included weather-resistant adapter for power. It's the same size as the previous indoor-only Wyze Cam with the same white plastic finish, but Wyze made some notable upgrades to its design and specs, too.
 The speaker on the back of the camera has been updated to allow for an 80-decibel siren (more on that later), while the microSD card slot (optional for local storage; the microSD card is sold separately) and the setup button underneath the camera have been covered to protect them from the elements. The attached stand looks similar to the previous one, allowing you to raise, lower and angle your camera as needed, but you can also remove it for a tripod- or screw-mounted installation.
 It also increase the camera's field of view from 110 to 130 degrees, improves the camera's performance in low-light conditions (more on this in a bit too) and lets you simply press the "Speak" button to use two-way talk from the Wyze app, rather than having to hold the button down to speak.

Kanta Prasad and his wife - the elderly couple owning the 'Baba ka Dhaba' that made headlines after a video about their struggle making ends meet in the pandemic went viral on Tuesday underwent cataract surgery. The medical procedure has been offered to the couple by Delhi's Sharp Sight Eye Hospital free of charge. We spent so many years with hazy, unclear vision. But now we can see everything crystal clear. It's like getting a new eye. Our economic condition is such that we could have never afforded cataract removal, Kanta Prasad said. Prasad and his wife's plight came to light last month after a social media influencer captured the 80-year-old owner of the Malviya Nagar food stall tearing up while narrating the challenges his family had been facing since the lockdown, and posted it on social media requesting people to help the couple. Soon after the video went viral, help poured in from across the city, and the country for the couple. We saw the video and more than his helpless state, we were moved by the spirit of the old man and his wife to fight hunger and earn livelihood for their family during these challenging times, said Deepshikha Sharma, CEO, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals. While many of us are confined to our homes fearing COVID-19, here's a couple who have a bigger worry and that is to survive and have no choice but to open their eatery every single day, Sharma said. According to the statement from the hospital, their objective was to help the couple recover their vision so that they wouldn't have to be dependent on others. Our team escorted the old couple to our hospital, and did a thorough eye check up and during investigations realised that their vision had deteriorated due to cataract. We decided to perform cataract surgery along with implantation of the latest type of intraocular lens as our way of giving them support, said Samir Sud, director and senior ophthalmologist, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals. As a result, the old couple can lead a new life independent of glasses and see the world around them brighter and clearer once both their eyes are operated, he said. Sud added that surgery had been performed on one eye for both of them and the second eye was scheduled to be operated on next week.

I’m in a really good place in my life.” Just don’t expect her to name her baby Sandy, she added.

Ferrier, White, and Yawn continued arguing about the Valium and whether the pen was THC, while third stew Jess More tried to butt her way into the discussion and the rest of the exasperated crew cradled their drinks. Then, Ferrier turned the conversation with a question for White: “If it was not about the cabin arrangements and this wasn’t a revenge thing, when you said to Sandy, ‘Hannah had her freakout last night,’ why did you not bring up then that I’d ask you to go try and find Valium?” she asked. White replied, “I didn’t realize that you were taking Valium all the time until I found it in our trash can and on our counter. It was right there.” Then Ferrier asked if White found her Valium the night she had her panic attack, and White replied that she did. “No you didn’t, you’re such a liar!” Ferrier responded, claiming “it wasn’t on board.” White repeated that Ferrier had Valium wrappers throughout their room, but Ferrier clarified that she had been taking Advil PM — which White said would still be against the rules —and insisted she didn’t take any Valium on board. More then jumped back in again, insisting that crew should’ve been made more aware of yachting rules around drugs. “You have no idea what you’re talking about,” Yawn told her. (At one point, More’s ex- boyfriend Rob Westergaard, a deckhand, claimed she asked him to throw away her own weed pen on board.)

As for the necessity for dialogue, her invitation to engage with Government bodies stands. The most important dialogue, however, will be between the Government and civil society, including political opposition, she said. Immediate steps should include the release of all arbitrary detainees including prominent opposition leaders. She also urged authorities to respect the separation of powers and said the executive must stop interfering with the justice system. Turning to the situation of juvenile detainees in the context of the pandemic, she said there are no physical distance provisions, most of the trials have been held behind closed doors, visits have been restricted, access to water is limited, and no masks or gloves are provided to prisoners. The international community must continue to monitor the situation in Belarus and support civil society organizations which remain resilient, constructive and non-violent, she asserted.

AHMAD NASSER AL-MOHAMMED AL-AHMED AL-JABER AL-SABAH, Minister for Foreign Affairs of _Kuwait_ , said that his country’s faith in the importance of the United Nations — and in the collaborative efforts of its Member States — has increased amid COVID‑19. “Such close cooperation as we have witnessed during the COVID‑19 pandemic is only the fruit of the efforts the Organization undertook during the past 75 years,” he said, describing it as the result of decades of collective effort. Recalling that the United Nations supported Kuwait in regaining its freedom and sovereignty in 1991 following a brutal Iraqi invasion, he underlined the Organization’s important commitment to safeguarding international peace and security “through crystal clear positions” and decisive resolutions. Today, States are called upon to recommit to the purposes and principles of the Charter and reject violence and division, as they face the crises and conflicts that still afflict many countries. In the Middle East, the Palestinian question is foremost among those crises, he said, describing it as a “bleeding wound in the side of the Arab nation”.

Looking forward, Ping An said: "Consumer demand for insurance and other financial services have recovered in the short run, but demand was still weaker compared to before the COVID-19 epidemic. Meanwhile, credit risk is rising and the asset management business remains under pressure in terms of quality. However, in the long run, profound changes in the domestic and foreign environment will also bring new opportunities, and further economic growth will be driven by rising potential domestic demand. People's health awareness will be stronger after the epidemic, and their demand for insurance and other financial services will grow. Moreover, driven by policies and technologies, the health care industry will develop rapidly, bringing increasing upstream and downstream industry growth opportunities. In response to the State's call, the Company will pursue steady progress, by executing our "finance + technology" and "finance + ecosystem" transformation strategies. By accelerating technological empowerment, the Company will seize new opportunities in industries, including financial services and health care to create greater value for shareholders, customers, and society."
