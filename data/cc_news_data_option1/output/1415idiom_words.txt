"The first week of the lockdown was when we were going to go play our first game. So it's difficult, but I think that the most important thing is that obviously, everybody stays healthy, stays safe, and then we can take the advice of the governments and the places where we're going to be playing. But I think that that's the most important thing.

"As a former captain, first of all he is one of the most natural leaders I've seen," Wilson told Omnisport when discussing Arteta, who has recovered from being diagnosed with coronavirus last month. "He's hugely bright, he's hugely eloquent. You only have to listen to his interviews.

So we're really excited. We're really excited to be owners of the team. It's something that feels different, but it's special."
