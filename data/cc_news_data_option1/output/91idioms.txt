This means that manufacturers won't need to drill holes for volume buttons, or power buttons, or any buttons at all. Ultrasense says its sensors can detect different levels of force, and the sensors can work in tandem to create a drag-to-activate feature, in addition to simpler tapping. By replacing physical switches, ultrasound sensors will help manufacturers build waterproof and rigid phones more easily. Ultrasense also says that its switch technology is more amenable to the needs of future 5G phones and their finicky mmWave antennas.

Trudeau has been to the WEF twice as prime minister. In 2016, his first full year in office, he spent three and a half days in Davos at the head of a six- member delegation, touting the "Canadian opportunity" and meeting with the likes of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
 In 2018, his speech focused on the benefits of free trade, as well as a call for gender equality in business; his meetings included Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty.
 Chrystia Freeland's absence is also notable. The deputy prime minister's history with the WEF and its attendees extends beyond her time in government, going back to her time as a journalist and author. "The real community life of the twenty-first-century plutocracy occurs on the international conference circuit," she wrote in her 2012 book _Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else_ , singling Davos out as the invitation that "marks an aspiring plutocrat's arrival on the international scene." __
 As foreign affairs minister, Freeland used the 2018 meeting to advance NAFTA negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer; last year, she focused on the political unrest in Venezuela, and met with corporate leaders from firms like Alibaba and Blackstone. But she's now Trudeau's domestic fixer -- she's spent the start of this week in Alberta, meeting with local leaders -- and the main implementer on key files like climate change policy, child care and interprovincial trade.
 Trump is scheduled to be in Davos this year, after withdrawing the U.S. delegation in 2019 a week before the event amid a government shutdown.
 Johnson reportedly banned his ministers from attending the WEF, with an unnamed official telling Politico that his government plans to focus on "delivering for the people, not Champagne with billionaires." However, U.K. Chancellor Sajid Javid will attend.
 The three Canadian cabinet members who are attending will have full agendas. The U.S. and France are hoping to seal a deal at the event over the latter's new digital-services tax, which targets Big Tech; the Trump administration has threatened US$2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the measure. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to meet in Davos, and the outcome of that settlement could draw in Morneau -- the Liberals promised a similar tax during last fall's election.
 Meanwhile, then-international trade minister Jim Carr spent last year's WEF working on a Canada-led effort to reform the World Trade Organization, which has been incapacitated by the U.S. blocking appointments to its appeals body. Ng's mandate from Trudeau includes advancing that work.
 Bains has used the WEF stage to announce major projects under the flagship Strategic Innovation Fund in each of the last two years. Catenaro said the government will release more details about the ministers' Davos plans closer to the event.

Believe it or not, some folks haven’t heard of this … or been to one.


  These benighted souls might even wrongly imagine a chickenque as a long line of leghorns waiting for tickets to “Madame Batterfry.” It’s not that they’re dumb clucks, only that it’s not everywhere that churches, charities and other organizations out to advance the common good regularly grill a small flock of chickens, plucked and split down the middle over a room-sized bed of glowing Kingsford contained in an impromptu cinderblock and fence-wire grill, as a community fundraiser to build a nest egg.


  A lot of organizations have found the results something to crow about. As fundraisers, chickenques pull in more than just chicken feed – and popular as they are, a person can feel a bit hen-pecked by the flock of ticket sellers making you feel like a real turkey for trying to duck out on another donation.


  Still, getting folks together to eat and socialize and do good for the community at the same time truly is the breast of both worlds.

It’s town’s biggest ding-a-ling.


  Several times a week, the bells ring out over Winona, hymns and not-quite- hymns, played by a carilloneur perched high above the city, hammering the harmonies on the 14 tuned bells hung higher still in the Wesley United Methodist Church tower.


  The bell tower was born out of one fire and is the survivor of a second. In 1895, after their church building went up in smoke, the members of Wesley vowed to replace it with a structure that would withstand the fires of hell if need be.


  The test came close.


  On Jan. 23, 1961, fire was discovered in just an hour before Sunday school. The blaze took hold with a vengeance, destroying the organ and sanctuary, leaving the Guild Hall and bell tower smoke-stained and cased in ice, but still standing. Five days later, carilloneur John Duel climbed the spiral stairs and the bells – freed by an array of heaters from the ice that saved them from the flames – rang out triumphantly over the city.

A community of learners improving our world.


  And for many in the Winona State University community, their first task is following the school’s motto by improving Winona.


  While the number of alcohol-related incidents may jump at the end of every August, and everyone knows to avoid Huff and Main Street on move-in day, there are just as many and more WSU students and employees volunteering their time at the Winona Area Humane Society or any number of organizations around town, or getting their hands dirty planting and cleaning downtown.


  That community spirit goes all the way back to WSU’s founding, when the Minnesota Legislature provided funding for a normal school with the caveat that the school would go to the first city that could raise the initial funds and provide the land. Winona beat out the competition and raised even more than was needed, with city residents pooling $7,000 and a location in the heart of the city.


  Today, WSU has national presence, and plans are in the works for a regional Education Village to create a new model for improving teacher training.


  Not bad for the first normal school west of the Mississippi.

With lakes, ponds, backwaters, main channels and even the Shives Road ditch, Winona has no shortage of fishing holes—and no shortage of people trying to catch fish.


  Ever since someone first decided to put string to pole, it seems someone has been fishing in Winona. During the spring and summer months, you can usually find someone tromping down a sidewalk or riding a bike carrying a fishing pole to one of the many piers on Lake Winona. In the winter, the truly hardy come out, resting their butts on ice-cold five-gallon pails and waiting for elusive panfish to bite.


  With boat landings providing access all over the Mississippi River and Lake Winona, there is nowhere fish can hide from someone determined to get them. But it always seems those without a boat are the most inventive in their search for the best fishing spot.


  Anglers will crawl over the Prairie Island spillway, drop a line off the levee, even wade into the waters next to barges at the city’s commercial harbor in search of a choice catch. And the weekend fish fries held by neighbors all over Winona are a testament to their dedication.

OK, O’Hare it ain’t … But it’s been around just about as long, and if you’re up in the air in a single-engine Cessna, it’s probably a lot easier to get in and out of.


  Located on the far west end of the city, hard by the river and close to the west-end industries that ferry on private jets the VIPs whose time is money, the Winona municipal airport serves the needs of private and corporate aviation with fuel, ground services and—most critically—a flat place to land and take off again.


  Ever since rickety bi-planes barnstormed in and out on grass landing strips, aircraft have been touching down and taking off from Winona’s west end. In the 1920s and ‘30s, pioneer aviator Max Conrad—Winona’s Flying Grandfather, born in 1903—launched commercial air service to Rochester, the Twin Cities and from thence to the world beyond, taught hundreds to fly, and went on to set nine world records for light plane flight. The municipal airport is known as Max Conrad Field in his memory.

Winona is the capital of stained glass?


  Well, if you say so.


  While Winona’s undoubtedly a colorful city, its oft-cited designation as "Stained Glass Capital of America" may well be simply credited to a travel writer who made a career of chronicling American oddities -- if not a career out of exhaustively verifying her claims.


  Still, it’s hard to deny the presence of the industry in Winona, from the large studios to the small and the stained glass present in churches and businesses across the city.


  One of Winona’s most prominent stained-glass manufacturers, Willet-Hauser, was purchased earlier this year – but any fears that it might leave town and diminish Winona’s claim to stained-glass fame disappeared quickly, when it turned out that the new owner’s father had once worked for the company for many years.

For 125 years, when an apple a day didn’t do the trick, sick and injured people in this area have turned to Winona Health and the organizations and institutions that it is founded upon for care.


  In 1894, Winona citizens and physicians pooled their resources, raised $4,500, and remodeled and equipped the Langley home, 261 W. Sanborn St., as an 18-bed hospital. Demand for hospital care soon proved the improvised facility inadequate, and in 1898 the cornerstone was laid for a new hospital building on West Wabasha Street at the site of the present Heritage Apartments.


  That building, constructed with $35,000 in community donations, would be at the heart of health care in Winona until Community Memorial Hospital was opened near the east shore of Lake Winona on Mankato Avenue in 1962. Further expansion and merger with the Winona Clinic in 2006 lead to the formation of an umbrella health care organization offering comprehensive, state-of-the-art, womb-to-tomb care.

In this town, we make stuff.


  From the beginning, we’ve made stuff.


  It started out small, like the town. A man comes ashore, sees a guy eating a sandwich, and gets the idea his fortune might not lie in growing wheat, but grinding flour. The fellow next to him looks around at the treeless sandbar and remembers the tractless pine forests just across the river to the north and gets to thinking about sawing wood…


  A century and a half later, Bay State is still milling wheat just east of the old levee. Go west a few blocks and barley is made into malt on its way to becoming beer … just across Third Street where Winona folks made parts for rocketships and turned out materials like no man had ever made before.


  Over the years, we’ve just about made it all—wagons and buckboards at the wagon works, some of the first farm tractors to lumber over the prairies, our mills turned out shingles, sweaters, tire chains and gloves. We’ve made pickles, smoked hams, ground carloads of pepper and sweetened the air with the scent of vanilla and cloves.


  In this town, we make stuff. And we do it well.

There are two types of bars in Winona: Downtown bars and neighborhood bars.


  Winona residents wise to the ways of the city avoid the hustle and bustle of college students and those ready to whoop it up downtown, opting instead for a quiet drink in a neighborhood bar, a chill place to meet others looking to unwind.


  Every corner bar – and there are bars on lots of corners in Winona – has its own character, created by everything from the location and décor to the clientele. Walk into any neighborhood bar—the East Side Bar, Rosie’s, Schniepp’s, the Handy Corner, or any other—and everyone turns to look, wondering if they know you. If they don’t, they’ll go back to their conversations. But if they do, you’ll be met by a round of greetings.


  For many regulars, the bars become their own communities. People watch out for each other, trust each other, join in potlucks, become friends and sometimes more. Many have said they found their family – at the neighborhood bar.

Though seemingly random at first, the Redskins and Cowboys share one of the fiercest rivalries that traces back to the 1960s. The two teams faced each other for the first time in 1960 and the vicious rivalry expanded both on and off the field. In 1961, a few plucky Cowboys fans crept into the Redskins’ stadium and scattered chicken feed throughout the field, planning to release a flock of chickens during the halftime show. Their plan would be thwarted just moments before halftime when a Redskins’ representative found the crates of birds. In the 1980s, Dallas head coach Tom Landry would film several commercials poking fun at the Redskins. In one commercial for American Express, Landry entered a saloon and was immediately mobbed by Washington players, stating “you’ll never know when you’re gonna be surrounded…by Redskins.”

Cringe-Worthy Friends Moments That Happened Behind The Scenes

In 1857 Winona was a struggling village of mud streets and rough-sawn lumber on a treeless prairie with a three-story brick-and-stone mansion taking shape on a high spot on the west side.


  To the pioneer settlers and the Dakota camped nearby, Henry Huff’s elaborate homestead had to look as out of place as a steamboat climbing the bluffs. Lacking even a street to give it an address – though Huff would remedy that small omission by platting the new-born city, naming the street running past his front porch for himself and the streets immediately to the west for his wife, Harriet, and son, Wilson, his Italianate mansion was an instant and lasting landmark.


  But the Huffs weren’t to be long for the city. With his money made, Henry and family packed up for brighter lights and bigger things in Chicago, selling the house on Huff Street to Henry Lamberton, whose family would call it home until 1956, when the last of the Lambertons died and the many-roomed house, outbuildings and grounds was converted to an orphanage.


  It was placed on the National Register of Historic places in 1976 and in 1982 Sauer Memorial Home purchased the property for use as an assisted-living facility. The Huff-Lamberton House went back on the market in 2006 and sold in 2011 for $600,000, somewhat more than half of its 2006 assessed value of $1.1 million.

 Onstage, “Sing Street” is directed by Tony winner Rebecca Taichman (“Indecent”) and features a book by Tony winner Enda Walsh (“Once”) and choreography by Sonya Tayeh (“Moulin Rouge”).
 It joins a crowded Broadway season of new musicals, which has yet to premiere the Bob Dylan vehicle “Girl From the North Country,” the Princess Diana title “Diana” and the LSD-centric creation “Flying Over Sunset.”
 It will also be the fifth musical this season to be directed by a woman, alongside the Tina Turner bio-musical “Tina” (Phyllida Lloyd), the Alanis Morissette jukebox musical “Jagged Little Pill” (Diane Paulus), the Henry VIII pop sensation “Six” (Lucy Moss, with Jamie Armitage) and the gender-flipped revival of “Company” (Marianne Elliott).

Dwelling in the sweet spot between Gen X cynicism and millennial optimism, we represent the best of both worlds.

It’s no average graveyard.


  Yes, more than 20,000 people have found a final resting place in the grounds of Woodlawn Cemetery, situated at the south end of Huff Street in Winona.


  But whether to learn about the characters of Winona’s past at Winona County Historical Society’s annual Cemetery Walk or to visit a relative buried there, to get a morning’s exercise or just enjoy a peaceful walk, plenty of people hail from Winona and beyond to enjoy the property. From above ground.


  There’s plenty to enjoy. The grounds are comprised of 220 acres of lush hilly terrain that extends into bluffs, with 50 acres reserved as burial ground.


  Early burials in the Winona area occurred at the mouth of Burns valley, just beyond Sugar Loaf. But the area was subject to flooding and wouldn’t do the trick. Central Park was also used as an early burial site, but city leaders soon sought a more permanent place.


  Woodlawn was officially founded by E.D. Williams in 1862, just 11 years after the city of Winona itself. Many of Winona’s notable families—such as the Watkins, the Lambertons and the Huffs—are buried there, as well as John Latsch, one of Winona’s greatest benefactors, and Stephen Taylor, the only Revolutionary soldier buried in Minnesota.

Besides squirrels, it’s hard to think of what’s more ubiquitous in Winona than college students—August through May, that is. With backpacks and lanyards, shiny new electronics and longboards, obnoxious drinking habits and a general disregard for local traffic patterns, the annual influx of thousands of students brings plenty of annoyances to Winona each fall. Just ask anyone who tries to maintain a normal sleep schedule or dislikes litter in neighborhoods.


  But, of course, those images don’t tell the whole story. Students bolster Winona’s economy with their dorm-room decorating, late-night wing consumption, and early-morning study parties at local coffee shops. Performing arts at the colleges add flavor to the local scene, there’s always a sporting event to watch, and students serve as volunteers and interns at a plethora of community organizations, with many choosing to stay and put down roots after graduation.


  The student presence in Winona isn’t exactly a new development, either: WSU was founded in 1858, just seven years after Captain Orrin Smith created the first white settlement in Winona in 1851. SMU followed in 1912, and Southeast Tech in 1949.

Fastenal, the company that made peddling nuts and bolts a billion-dollar business, is pretty much the stuff of local legend.


  Folks love to tell how the blue-and-white logo spread from a little shop on Lafayette Street to Rome, Shanghai, and more than 2,700 places in between, headed up by a local boy who, even when he’d made more money than most folks could spend, wore second-hand suits and flew coach—the back of the plane doesn’t get there much ahead of the front, so why pay more?


  Started by Bob Kierlin and a circle of high school friends in 1967, the big idea behind what would become a big company was a simple one—be the place than someone could get any size, shape, grade or length of any kind of nut, bolt, screw, washer, toggle, or what-have-you—get any kind of fastener with one stop, in one order, in one place. A store where you could fasten-all things … and a name that’s probably more catchy than Bob’s Bolts.

"Over the last number of months, the profession has undertaken a comprehensive process to ensure that students are treated fairly, and that the due diligence completed is thorough," CPA Canada said in a statement Tuesday.
 "As a result of this work, we have every confidence in the integrity and reliability of the results of the September 2019 CFE (common final examination) and that all passing candidates have met the same entry requirement for the CPA profession as in previous sittings."
 A handful of candidates who were successful on the final examination expressed relief after receiving their results Tuesday morning, more than a month later than usual due to the circumstances.
 "I passed so I feel OK now," said one newly minted Ontario CPA, who had expressed frustration in earlier correspondence with the Post over what he described as longstanding technology issues with CPA Canada evaluations.
 Another CPA candidate, who wrote the final exam in Ottawa, called the offer of a free re-write -- along with a complementary course module to prepare for the final exam -- a "kind gesture." But he said the "compensation" would fall short for those who prepared for months and still feel they failed the final "because of the system's glitches."
 The independent review concluded that there were no examinations where the "threat to validity was too high to warrant scoring."

When Winona boasted more millionaires per capita than any other American city, this was where the millionaires lived.


  At the dawn of the 20th century, sawmills howled and towering piles of fresh sawn lumber lined the Winona levee—and rich profits lined the pockets of Winona businessmen. It was the Gilded Age, “if you’ve got it, flaunt it” was the rule, and the homes they built did proclaim, “Here lives a wealthy man!”


  Like birds of a feather, the lumber barons and merchant magnates flocked around the First Ward Park at the northeast corner of Huff and Broadway. The neighborhood had been the most prestigious in the city since Henry Huff built his multi-story mansion just north of the park fronting a street he named for himself, with the streets directly to the east – Harriet and Wilson – named for his wife and son.


  The owners of the homes in the neighborhood is an architectural who’s who of 19th century Winona – Hodgins, Tearse, Youmans, Windom … The neighborhood has since been designated the Windom Park Historic District, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
