In the land transport sector, the task of transferring freight from road to rail is ongoing. The port has made substantial investments in this area and will continue to do so. Examples include an upgrade of the Port Line to a double-track system, and new dedicated rail transloading terminals. Both these developments will ensure the Port of Gothenburg continues to have the world's highest proportion of rail-borne freight to and from the port. Despite this, there is still potential to move more freight from road to rail.      At sea, the port is creating incentives and conditions to bring about a green transition. On the local level, expansion of shoreside power for ships at berth is an important component, and the port also offers port tariff discounts to vessels that have made environmentally smart choices. The rapid emergence of digitalisation will also result in more effective calls and a reduction in emissions. The port is pursuing these issues both globally and on the EU level, including stricter demands regarding the climate footprint of shipping fleets.

PEORIA -- The Illinois Elementary School Association might have to suspend operations for the first time in its 91-year history as a side-effect of the COVID-19 pandemic regulations in Illinois.
   
 "We are in financial difficulty," longtime IESA executive director Steve Endsley said Wednesday. "We are like any mom-pop business impacted by COVID. We have no income. We're not able to stage tournaments, have any spectators permitted. Without that revenue we can't continue.
   
 "I would say we have enough left to operate for another five or six months. We're not going to fold, no. But there is a chance we might have to hit the pause button. We might have to suspend operations, be dormant for a while."
   
 The impact of the IESA is huge. The organization has 900 member schools and in 2019-20 offered 24 boys and girls sports that generated 156,843 participants.
   
 Endsley says the IESA is operating on an annual budget of about $1.6 million. He says tournament revenue accounts for about $1 million annually.
   
 Each IESA member school pays yearly dues of $100. In addition, each school pays $55 for each team in each sport in which it participates. A school with a boys and girls basketball team, for example, would pay a $110 yearly fee for hoops.
   
 "That of course is not enough to take care of our operating budget," Endsley said. "And the fees for 2020-21 have already been collected. We have enough to keep us going for a few more months. But if we can't have tournaments, we're going to have to take steps."
   
 Suspending operations is one such step. Getting a loan to make ends meet is another.
   
 "To be frank, though, the only asset we have (that can be used) to acquire a loan is our building. And if we go out and get a loan, what good does that do if we still can't have tournaments?" Endsley said. "Tournaments are our lifeblood. And schools are not going to continue paying member fees if there's no benefit from it. We're living on reserves right now."
   
 COVID triggered the loss of volleyball, wrestling and track tournaments for the IESA. Endsley said that accounted for $400,000 in lost revenue.
   
 The IESA had eight full-time employees and a part-time technical person in mid-summer.
   
 Amid the dim financial prognosis, two of those full-time employees left -- seeking job security.
   
 "I don't have the money to replace them," Endsley said. "The bulk of that is covered from revenue gathered by tournaments."
   
 The Illinois Department of Public Health is expected to announce its decision on the status of basketball and other winter sports on Oct. 28.
   
 But a green light to play doesn't necessarily help. The Peoria Rivermen and Quad City Storm (Moline), both in the Southern Professional Hockey League, have opted out of the coming SPHL season because current Illinois state COVID restrictions won't allow more than 50 people to attend an event. And that includes participants. In other words, no fans permitted.
   
 If IDPH does the same with winter sports next week -- allowing games, but only without spectators -- then IESA is still in trouble.
   
 "The side of me that wants kids to get a chance to participate in sports, that is great," Endsley said. "They need it, they need the competition, they need it physically and psychologically.
   
 "But from an IESA organization standpoint, playing without spectators is not good news. We would have all of the expenses of conducting tournaments, with no way of generating revenue.
   
 "It's so sad that an organization like ours, which has operated for 91 years, could be a casualty of COVID-19."

Suspicions were first raised at the school in Crumpsall, which has 1,800 pupils, in 2016 when it was discovered there was £30 in a school account, when there should have been around £8,000.
 Manchester Crown Court was told Crook was asked to look into the discrepancy, but failed to report any findings saying she 'hadn't had time'.
 A painstaking investigation was then launched by a fraud officer from Manchester council.
 Her investigation concluded that at least £27,672 of cash that she could prove the school had received, had gone missing - and that the person responsible for the loss must have been Crook.
 Most of the stolen cash was dinner money, which was paid by the pupils into a machine, which then credited their food account.
 The amount also included cash paid for uniforms, trips and clubs.

Stiamo quindi chiedendo alle scuole un sacrificio particolare: quello di individuare quali sono le linee di trasporto che, secondo il giudizio dei ragazzi, delle famiglie e delle scuole stesse, sono sovraccariche e quindi hanno bisogno del disallineamento degli orari, in modo tale da utilizzare più volte lo stesso mezzo, o del rafforzamento della linea con nuovi mezzi e autisti. Queste non sono risorse illimitate, ma siccome la situazione diventa sempre più complicata, abbiamo chiesto a tutte le scuole, per le ultime tre classi delle superiori, di andare da lunedì in didattica a distanza e quindi di fornirci poi questi dati, in modo tale da poter riattivare la didattica in presenza man mano che avremo meglio organizzato il rapporto tra le scuole e i vettori del trasporto scolastico.

Quibi also had the distinct disadvantage of arriving months after competitors like the one from Katzenberg's old studio, Disney, and Apple TV+, while vying for attention with HBO Max (from CNN parent WarnerMedia) and Comcast's Peacock -- two ventures that, notably, rely on the deep bench provided by library product as well as the appeal of new shows.
 Soon enough, Quibi was reduced to a punchline, which is never really the kind of publicity you want for this sort of fledgling venture. The fact that principals didn't appear to be entirely on the same page in interviews only added to the sense the concept might be in trouble.
 Since questions of Quibi's future arose, more jokes have flown in social media -- an inevitable byproduct, perhaps, but no less distasteful given that plenty of people who joined the company with the best of intentions will lose those positions.
 In an open letter, Katzenberg and Whitman acknowledged that they might never know exactly why Quibi failed, "because the idea itself wasn't strong enough to justify a standalone streaming service or because of our timing."
 The media migration from the traditional ad-supported template to a direct-to- consumer subscription model continues to basically fly blind, leaving companies largely guessing about where the saturation point resides. Additional casualties seem destined to follow, and as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told CNN Business in September, while well-defined brands such as HBO and Disney will likely survive, "We'll see what happens with the others. There'll be some consolidation."
 For Quibi, the speed of its fall suggests a near-perfect storm of factors, some perhaps unique. Yet its fate also serves as a warning that with so many services jockeying for limited time and money -- and not incidentally, the media attention necessary to help spur them -- newer players can only reasonably expect so many bites at the apple, quick or otherwise.

Quibi won't be the last casualty of the streaming wars, as studios and other new players vie for consumers' time. But its demise -- officially announced Wednesday, only six months after its launch -- will likely be recorded as one of the most predictable, reflecting a business plan founded on questionable demand that also came at the worst possible time.
 Founded by Disney and DreamWorks alumnus Jeffrey Katzenberg and former Hewlett Packard and eBay CEO Meg Whitman, Quibi billed itself as filling two distinct needs: An appetite for slickly produced content during the down time that people have while out and about, and the tendency to occupy those gaps by perusing phones.
 Hence, its much-lampooned "quick bites" formula, providing TV shows and documentaries sliced into 7-9-minute episodes, generated by marquee talent both in front of and behind the camera.

A total of 101,494 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to October 14 – a rise of 12% in positive cases on the previous week.
 The latest data shows that of 96,521 people transferred to the system, 80.7% were reached and asked to provide details of recent close contacts.
 This is up slightly on 79.9% in the previous week.
 Labour’s Justin Madders said it was time for ministers to admit that the private companies being paid millions of pounds to help run the system “aren’t up to the job”.
 Shadow health minister Mr Madders said: “To have over 40 per cent of people not even being contacted by the test and trace system is an interstellar sized black hole in the Government’s plan to reduce transmission.
 “How much longer are we expected to put up with this dangerous failure before ministers admit that the likes of Serco just aren’t up to the job?
 “The need for a circuit break is absolutely critical now and that time should be used to fix test and trace once and for all.”

When planning a vacation around water activities, most travelers would not consider the desert. The variety of such activities will surprise those who visit Mesa, Arizona.      There are three lakes and two rivers within 30 minutes of this third-largest city in Arizona. The lakes and rivers offer water sports from kayaking to water skiing, scenic desert views and relaxing while fishing from one of the many miles of shoreline.      Traveling to Louisville, Kentucky, or Memphis, Tennessee, one would expect to take a steamboat cruise. But, in the middle of the desert in Tortilla Flat, Arizona, it is unexpected. Here the Dolly offers a scenic, 90-minute nature cruise on Canyon Lake that spotlights the Superstition Mountains and their lore. As the captain guides the Dolly he tells of the stories and history.      Cruisers will most likely come upon bald eagles, elusive bighorn sheep and other desert wildlife while enjoying the beautiful desert mountain landscape. Learn about the desert flora and the magnificent saguaro cacti. Don't forget your camera, and maybe bring binoculars to help see those sheep that virtually hang on the mountain side. Visitors also will learn how the area was formed geologically.      The Dolly Steamboat has been cruising since 1925. Also available are a twilight dinner cruise and the Astronomy Dinner Cruise, including a presentation on the solar system with Dr. Sky and dinner.

HINGHAM - The goals for the Hingham High boys cross-country team had to be modified for this season because of what's happening with the pandemic.
 "We are trying to take each week as it comes. With all the COVID modifications we have to be very careful and try to protect the team," Head Coach Fred Jewett said. "This keeps our goals more closely aligned to the Patriot League schedule. We don't know if we will have a League Meet but there are no MIAA postseason meets this season in any sport."
 An early-season meet against Plymouth North had to be canceled so the Harbormen have had only two opportunities to race so far this fall. They've picked up a win over Duxbury and lost to Whitman-Hanson. Races that are still remaining on the schedule include Marshfield (Oct. 22), Silver Lake (Oct. 29) and Plymouth North on Nov. 5.
 The Harbormen have 38 runners in the program and the team captains are Noah Sharp, Kevin Ierardi and Sean McCay. Jewett praised their leadership skills, saying "we are in the best condition we've been in the last 10 years" because of the running they've done since the spring. Other top returning runners are Matt Hall, Tom Shetzline, Charley Donahue and Leo Burm.
 Junior Steve McDougle, a first-year runner, has been a great addition to the team and has slotted into the first spot in the running order. Donahue, a sophomore, has stepped up to take over the second spot.
 "Charley's emergence has been a nice surprise," Jewitt said. "He has a great future ahead of him."
 This season has been a challenge for everyone but Jewitt said he and the team are trying to make the best of it.
 "I want to thank my assistant coaches and the captains for being incredibly vigilant about masks and social distancing. There are so many restrictions that it is difficult to do many of the workouts that we used to do but everyone is highly motivated and trying to win despite the terrible conditions," Jewett said. "I applaud all the runners and coaches for the extra care and enthusiasm at this stressful time. We fight to stay healthy every day."

Paul Stevens Verner, age 63, died peacefully at his home on Monday, October 19. He was born on June 6, 1957, in Fort Worth, Texas, the third child of Mildred Broome and Walter Eugene Verner. He graduated from Raleigh Egypt High School and attended the University of Memphis. After working in several fields, he returned to school to become a nurse, graduating in 1998, and serving as president of the Student Nursing Government Association. He worked in Memphis for several years at local hospitals before settling in as a travelling Emergency Room nurse. He spent many years in California and also worked in Texas, Maine, and Arizona. He eventually retired from nursing for health reasons. Paul was a character, but not accidentally, he wasn't an oddball. He was a character in the way an artist is- cultivated and eccentric, not a good time Charlie but a bon vivant, not a guy who could spin a yarn but a raconteur. It's more than a difference in the wording. He was tender-hearted, sentimental, extravagant and wildly impractical. He spent hours sending illustrated letters to his family and friends. He loved literature, especially The Goldfinch, his cats, Miss Wina and Marie, classic automobiles, and staying in touch with friends from childhood and beyond. He especially loved his three special girls, who predeceased him, his sister Susan, his grandmother Margaret, and his beloved mother Millie, and his father Buck. He had close relationships with all of his grandparents and family. He leaves behind his sister Carol and her husband Dennis, his brother Tim and his wife Kathy, and his sister Susan's husband Larry. He adored his nephews, Jamie, Taylor, Nick and Camp, and also his niece Mary Stevens who predeceased him. He planned occasional movie nights to get the guys together, and also devoted many hours to entertaining the little ones in past decades. For one 4 year old nephew he orchestrated a months long series of letters, newspaper classified ads, photos, and a scavenger hunt, to solve the mystery of the Turtle in the Box. Arrangements will be handled by Forest Hill East, with a graveside service at Big Creek Cemetery in Millington, at 10 AM on Saturday. He will be serenaded with Bach's Air from Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, as he wished.

One exception to this rule, however, is if the suit requests money in the form of “nominal damages.” These damages are symbolic: Usually a court orders the transfer of $1 between the parties. But by putting this dollar in the dock, a case can stay alive and the government can be forced to concede wrongdoing. To do so, it must pay the dollar and enter a judicially-enforced agreement not to enforce its old code.

Sponges are sometimes referred to as the ocean's vacuum cleaners. They feed on tiny particles suspended in the currents, by filtering them from the seawater that passes through their highly porous tissues—which are supported by mineralized skeletons in many species. To assess their utility as bioindicators for microparticulate pollutants, Wörheide and colleagues studied 15 samples of a type of mineralized sponges belonging to the class known as "demosponges" from a coral reef off the coast of the island of Bangka in Northern Sulawesi (Indonesia). "We chose this site because Southeast Asia is a hotspot for plastic pollutants in the oceans," says Elsa B. Girard, lead author of the study. Girard recently graduated from the Master's Program in Geobiology and Paleobiology at LMU, and her contribution to the paper was part of her Master's thesis. "In light of the impact of global warming, and the overexploitation of marine resources, local sponge species could act as useful biomonitors of micropollutants, and help us to develop appropriate measures to reduce the deleterious effects of these substances on reef communities," she explains.

 When planning a vacation around water activities, most travelers would not consider the desert. The variety of such activities will surprise those who visit Mesa, Arizona.
 There are three lakes and two rivers within 30 minutes of this third-largest city in Arizona. The lakes and rivers offer water sports from kayaking to water skiing, scenic desert views and relaxing while fishing from one of the many miles of shoreline.
 Traveling to Louisville, Kentucky, or Memphis, Tennessee, one would expect to take a steamboat cruise. But, in the middle of the desert in Tortilla Flat, Arizona, it is unexpected. Here the Dolly offers a scenic, 90-minute nature cruise on Canyon Lake that spotlights the Superstition Mountains and their lore. As the captain guides the Dolly he tells of the stories and history.
 Cruisers will most likely come upon bald eagles, elusive bighorn sheep and other desert wildlife while enjoying the beautiful desert mountain landscape. Learn about the desert flora and the magnificent saguaro cacti. Don't forget your camera, and maybe bring binoculars to help see those sheep that virtually hang on the mountain side. Visitors also will learn how the area was formed geologically.
 The Dolly Steamboat has been cruising since 1925. Also available are a twilight dinner cruise and the Astronomy Dinner Cruise, including a presentation on the solar system with Dr. Sky and dinner.
 The boat is air-conditioned and a snack bar is on board offering snacks, water, soda and alcohol. Visit dollysteamboat.com for regulations and reservations, or call 480-827-9144. CDC COVID-19 safety recommendations are being followed on Dolly cruises.
 Canyon Lake has 28 miles of shoreline and offers RV and tent camping, boat rental and fishing. Visit canyonlakemarina.com.
