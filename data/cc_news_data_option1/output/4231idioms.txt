338Canada Poll - Neck and Neck in this riding


--DocBreak--
By Libby George and Alexis Akwagyiram


  LAGOS () - Authorities on Tuesday imposed a round-the-clock curfew on the Nigerian state of Lagos - including Africa's biggest city - in response to protests against alleged police brutality which they said had turned violent.


  The national police chief also ordered the immediate deployment of anti-riot forces following increased attacks on police facilities, a police spokesman said.


  The Lagos state governor's spokesman, Gboyega Akosile, said: "The curfew will not end tomorrow. A 24-hour curfew means all round the clock, day and night. It is indefinite. Nobody moves until we lift the curfew."


  Citizens in the commercial capital stocked up on food after the announcement. Staples such as tomatoes and eggs were sold out in some places as women in markets closed shops and people queued at cash machines.


  GT Bank, one of the largest lenders in Nigeria, said all its branches would remain closed for the duration of the curfew.


  Thousands of Nigerians demanding an end to alleged police brutality have taken to the streets every day for nearly two weeks across the country. Amnesty International said at least 15 people had been killed since the protests began.


  Rights groups had for years accused the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a police unit targeting violent crime, of extortion, harassment and torture. But a video allegedly showing SARS officers killing a man in Delta state sparked the protests. Police denied the incident, and disbanded SARS on Oct. 11, but protests have persisted.


  Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the curfew would apply to all parts of the state, including the metropolis of Lagos, Africa's largest city with 20 million inhabitants. Only essential workers were exempted.


  It had been imposed as the protests had turned violent, he said.


  "I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the wellbeing of our society," Sanwo-Olu said.


  A police station in the Orile Iganmu area of Lagos was set ablaze on Tuesday, TV news station Channels reported.


  The Lagos Chamber of Commerce said Nigeria's economy had suffered an estimated loss of 700 billion naira ($1.84 billion)in the last 12 days due to the disruption.


  Early in the protests, police fired on protesters in the Surulere area of Lagos and elsewhere. Armed gangs have attacked protesters in Lagos and the capital Abuja.


  The southwestern state of Ekiti imposed a curfew hours after the announcement in Lagos. Its governor said protests had been "hijacked" by criminals who sought to "rape, assault, rob and extort innocent citizens".


  The southern state of Edo on Monday imposed a similar curfew after a jailbreak by prisoners during protests. Police said they had strengthened security around prisons nationwide.


  The speaker of Nigeria's lower chamber of parliament, Femi Gbajabiamila, said he would not sign off on the federal budget for 2021 unless it included provisions to compensate victims of police brutality over the past two decades.


  Youth minister Sunday Dare said on Monday the government had met demonstrators' demands for talks on reforms in law enforcement and urged them to enter into dialogue..


  Officials say they fear a surge in coronavirus infections due to people attending demonstrations.

  Better Business Bureau issues warning about Flyest Kicks


  The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is warning consumers nationwide about online retailer The Flyest Kicks LLC. The company operates the website theflyestkicks.com, which says it "acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers" of upscale sneakers. The site was created in April. BBB has received 53 customer complaints since June from 19 states and Washington, D.C. The Flyest Kicks has failed to respond to 17 of the complaints, seven remain unresolved and another 18 are still pending. The Flyest Kicks has an F rating with BBB due to unanswered and unresolved complaints. In addition to sending individual complaints to the company as they were received, BBB of the Mid- South sent the company a letter by email and USPS on Aug. 19 expressing its concern about the number and nature of the complaints. BBB asked the company to submit a plan to address the underlying problems. The company has not responded to BBB's request. Complaints allege that customers placed orders online but never received their products. Some complainants said they received the wrong items. Complaints also cite a lack of responsiveness by the company when contacted with concerns about orders or requests for refunds. BBB encourages consumers to research companies prior to making an online purchase. Reading reviews or complaints filed by others can help you decide whether you want to spend your money with that business. To research companies, go to BBB.org. To read about scams, go to the BBB Scam News Feed. If you've been targeted by a scam, help others avoid the same problem by reporting your experience at BBB.org/ScamTracker.
