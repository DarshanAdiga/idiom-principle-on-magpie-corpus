AMRITSAR The four-member panel constituted by the Akal Takht to resolve the issue of statues of folk dancers on the Heritage Street that leads to Golden Temple, met Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon on Friday.The DC assured the panel that an amicable solution of the issue will be found out next week.After the meeting with the panel which pressed him to address the demand of Sikh bodies to remove the statues from the place, Dhillon said he is serious about the issue, but the rank and file of the government is busy in celebrations of the Republic Day falling on Sunday."Once the government functionaries are free from the busy schedule in two-three days, I will arrange a meeting of the Sikh representatives with the government to find out an amicable solution," he said.Speaking on behalf of the panel, SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said the busy schedule is an excuse. "If the government wants, it can take decision about any issue overnight. So, we request the government to take a decision on priority without any delay. This issue cannot be prolonged anymore as the Sikh sentiments are associated with it," he added.Meanwhile, the indefinite sit-in on the heritage street continued on Friday. Apart from the removal of the statues, the protesters are demanding cancellation of the case registered against the Sikh youngsters for vandalising the statues on January 15.SIKH MEN OPPOSE PROTESTERSA video has gone viral on social media, in which some Sikh men are seen confronting with the protesters on the Heritage Street and opposing them in harsh words.All these men were turbaned and they alleged that the protesters wanted to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of Punjab.

Editor's note: This is one of an ongoing series of stories written by Clinton High School seniors about their Senior Project internships.
 In our junior year at Clinton High School, we had to choose classes for senior year. We were told by the older students that there was a class where you leave during the seventh period to do an internship wherever you like. We went and talked to the teacher, Mrs. Ellen Welsh, to see what we could do for internships and we asked if it would be possible to do an internship with the police station since we knew a police officer in town.
 "A career in law enforcement was always an option for me but I wasn't sure If I would like it. I thought I would rather do an internship and not like it than go to college, get a degree, and find out the job isn't for me," Colby Armstrong said. "One of the main reasons we wanted to do an internship with the police station is because we love helping people and making the community a better place. After going to the internship for four months now we can truly understand why these hard-working individuals do what they do."
 "Since I was little I always had an eye on being a police officer," Nolan Neil said. "It started when I was really young on Halloween; I dressed up as a police officer and thought it was the coolest thing. I have always loved helping people and my neighbors whenever I could, I also love trying to figure out how to solve problems or see how others worked. Once we started the internship I knew for a fact this law enforcement is what I want to do and where I belong."
 Our intern host, Jim McNamara, is a patrolman for the Clinton Police Department. He reports to Chief Mark Laverdure. He has been a police officer for 27 years as of Jan. 10. Jim is a very nice guy who has taught us a lot of different things from how to go about dealing with certain situations to helping us plan out our careers and life after high school. He has been a great teacher and leader who has multiple people looking up to him day after day. Jim is one of the most experienced officers on the CPD and receives the utmost respect from his fellow co-workers and the community itself.
 Jim once told us, "You have to learn to adapt to the situation. If you don't improvise and think in the moment, it could be the difference between life and death." When he said this, it all made sense. You can read all the books in the world about how to deal with different situations and how to handle all sorts of different criminals, but if you only go by the book and your training and never adjust to the situation no matter how trained you are, you could still fail. Your life is always on the line so no matter how many books you read it is also about situational awareness and adapting to that specific case.
 During internship visits, we will go on ride-alongs, learn ways to defend ourselves and sometimes work out with Jim. He taught us about the "broken windows theory" \- if people make a mess of the community and nobody does anything about it, it will stay as a messy and ugly community. He gave us the idea to go around town and make a difference by finding graffiti and matching the original color of the wall that had the graffiti on it and paint over it. So that is exactly what we did.
 Since then, there has been someone going around putting new graffiti all over the place and making the community messy again. We know there will always be people like this out there, but if people don't do anything about it, that's when the community falls. That is why you will always find a few people in the community who want to make a difference and take it into their own hands just like Jim has taught us.
 We want to thank Officer Jim McNamara for being not only one of the best police officers in the Clinton Police Department, but also for being a great person outside of the job. We also want to thank the dispatchers and officers for allowing us to learn and take part in the department as a whole.

It's worth noting that being out of shape is not equivalent to being overweight. Stamina and endurance are both clearly correlated with overall physical fitness and, thus, necessarily, with weight. But to blame a player's lethargy on their weight without any concrete information besides appearance is undoubtedly a flawed way to evaluate their fitness on the whole. And while maintaining a certain weight is par for the course in limiting an athlete's risk for injury, crediting weight for a past injury or using a player's size to speculate about the length of their career is not only unfounded but also reckless.

This "potato thing" sizzled into my life when my 6-year-old son decided to cook a potato.      He grated a spud, heated oil in a pan and added the tangle of potato shreds, and had the sense to leave the pan on low heat before getting distracted, which might be the only reason he managed to cook Potato Thing. The human urge to mess with things unnecessarily may have no greater stage than the kitchen. Potato Thing prefers to be left alone. Until it's time to flip.      I was in the kitchen at just the right time to flip this sizzling disk that smelled of gold. Gazing at the browned side now facing up, I saw the bright, greasy matrix of crunchy potato fibers that I had been smelling. We gathered 'round the pan, attracted by the smell. When the other side was done, we feasted on the tater tot-like magnificence of a crispy exterior and its pillowy center.      Since then, I've been seeing Potato Thing everywhere. Even the gas station the other morning, when my hunting buddy got back into the car with a so-called "Potato Triangle" that looked familiar, or the local greasy spoon, which serves this side called "hash browns."      The kids kept asking me to make it again, and I tried, but couldn't recreate the magic of that original thing.      At the farmers market, where so much important information is shared, Big Nancy set me straight on Potato Thing, or "fries," as she calls them.      "You need a really hot pan," the potato grower said, nodding understandingly when I told her about my troubles.   "You know how to make Potato Thing?" I asked, eagerly.      "It's pretty much the only way I eat spuds."      For the next three weeks, I made Potato Thing. On weekends I'd visit Big Nancy at the market, buy potatoes and talk Potato Thing.      She recommends waxy potatoes like Huckleberry Gold, a purple skinned yellow- fleshed variety she sells, or its more common cousin the Yukon Gold. A lot of water gets released during the course of a batch, and Big Nancy covers her skillet with a tight fitting lid, which concentrates the steam and cooks the potatoes at a temperature that's hotter than boiling water. Her cast iron lid collects water, which she occasionally pours off.      When I make it, I squeeze out the water before frying. And that's not the only way my Potato Thing differs from hers. But we are perfectly aligned in the most important part, where you just stand there and don't do anything. No stirring. One flip. And it's done.      Potato Thing   The quantities listed are for a single Potato Thing that will fill a six-inch pan. You can grate and mix larger batches, and even use a larger pan, but keep the individual Potato Things small and manageable. Some cheese, egg or other goodies will add depth and contrast, not to mention protein, to Potato Thing.      For 1 six-inch Potato Thing   • 1 pound peeled potato   • 1 tablespoon high temperature fry oil (safflower and peanut are my favorites)   • ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper   • Optional toppings: cheese, chile flakes, jalapeno slices, egg      Grate the potato and save the small, French fry-sized piece that remains in your fingertips after you don't dare grate any further. Squeeze out the water from the grated potato in a colander, as if making a snowball, and then transfer the potato to a bowl. Add the salt and pepper (and chile flakes, if you wish) and mix.      Pat the ball into a hockey puck-sized disk that fits on a spatula.      Heat the oil on medium/high. As it heats, add the potato end you didn't grate, and adjust the heat to a temperature where the fry cooks gently, bubbling contentedly but not menacingly. That's your cue that the oil is ready.      Remove the small fry and add the puck of shredded potato.      Use a spatula, fork or even your fingers to shape the thing into a circle that's about a half-inch deep. Press gently on the thicker parts, first in the center and then the edges, while pulling in the rim to keep it sharp. By this time it should be sliding in the pan like an air hockey puck. Put the lid on and hover nearby on alert. The minute you start to smell a hint of overbrowning, flip it.   If you look at the bottom and conclude you flipped it too early, you can re- flip it again later. For now, let the new side cook, lid on.      If it looks like it needs oil, add just a little, or some butter. When you smell brown, turn it down, and let it slowly cook home. Turning down the heat at the end allows time to add toppings like cheese, a fried egg or both.      Put the lid back on to melt the cheese. Serve hot.      If it cools down, don't despair. Re-fried in oil, Potato Thing reheats as well as any leftover, but more golden.

There was next a move made to remove Dr. Marcus Allen from the board for cause and to remove Chairman of the Board Mr. Rick Matheny from the board for cause. Eight board members names were typed on the letters, but were not signed. Some of those whose names were listed stated they had not agreed to the letters and wanted to know who put their names on the documents.  Mr. Darryl Johnson took credit for the effort to remove the two members from the board and a lengthy free for all ensued between several of those present, with the parliamentarian trying to intercede.  The board ultimately voted to reject the letters submitted asking for the removal of Dr. Allen and Mr. Matheny due to failure to follow the procedures set forth by the bylaws.  State officials advised the board that the procedures were not in accordance to the bylaws of the agency.

So 4.8 times isn't unreasonable based on the makeup of the company's portfolio.

WEST BOYLSTON - After a successful fall festival, two members of the Celebrations Committee were ready to talk about more activities for the town.
 But to make things successful, more volunteers are needed.
 Michaun Fowler and Tony Sanders met with selectmen Wednesday, Jan. 22, to talk about some of the ideas and what is in the works.
 Fowler said they are forming subcommittees and involving volunteers.
 "These are passionate folks with great ideas and suggestions," she said.
 The first activity will likely be a spring clean-up, around Earth Day, which they will do in coordination with the DCR so there is one large event, rather than two smaller ones, like was held last year.
 A spring celebration could be an Easter egg hunt. While the existing town Celebrations Committee is retaining control of Memorial Day, the new subgroup will provide support.
 "They are adamant they do not want to change what they do, but improve it and get more people to come out," Fowler said.
 Then the group will hold a Fall Festival, which they hope will be even bigger than last year, when about 80 adults attended, along with their children. Fowler said it was like a family day and all the vendors involved have already signed up to return.
 "In the summer, we will partner with the DCR, which holds many events around the reservoir," Fowler said. "They have asked us to promote these activities. The subcommittee is also working on ideas for summer and winter activities."
 Fireworks, one activity residents have said they would like to see return to town, need a funding source. The town used to have business sponsor banners on Route 12, and that money was used to help pay for activities. But MassHighway reportedly asked the municipal light department to take them down.
 Town Administrator Nancy Lucier said she will be talking to a representative of MassHighway to see why that happened when other communities along state numbered routes have similar banners hanging.
 "The banners are a great way to raise funds for celebrations," Lucier said.
 Anyone who wants to volunteer to help the Celebrations Committee can contact the town administrator's office for information.
 In other business
 • Lucier recognized Town Accountant Leslie Guertin with this year's Town Administrator's Commitment to Excellence Award.  
 • With the popularity of programming at the library, Lucier proposed installing 17 parking spaces along the West Common on Church Street.
 She said DPW Superintendent Gary Kellaher explained the work could be done in- house with surplus supplies, keeping the costs minimal.
 However, selectmen expressed concern about whether the spaces closest to Route 12 would be used and whether there would be other challenges, including the quality of sidewalks and lighting.
 Lucier will continue to talk to the Planning Board and Kellaher, focusing on the five spots nearest the library.
 • The town continues to talk to Berlin about sharing a facilities manager. For Berlin, Selectman Lisa Wysocki will be the representative to the talks. West Boylston Selectman Chris Rucho volunteered to represent his board.
 • Selectmen OK'd new pricing for leasing rooms at the senior center during times when the facility is not needed for senior programming.
 The weekday rates for the multipurpose room and kitchen will be $60 an hour for residents and $80 for non-residents. On the weekends, the rates increase to $80 and $100, respectively.
 There is no cost for town groups and nonprofits. Out-of-town nonprofits will be charged the residents' rate. Fees were also set up for must the multi- purpose room, as well as the arts and craft room and the classrooms.

CLINTON - Work is progressing on a new look for downtown Clinton even as new walking trails are planned for those whose trek could prompt them to visit local businesses.
 The Mass Central Rail Trail is potentially growing, with the Clinton Greenway Conservation Trust seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
 At this point, the tunnel seems in good shape, according to Frannie Hodge, who noted engineering review of the old railroad tunnel off Route 70 that would be part of the purchase poised to add property to the trail system.
 In a years-long process, the Trust has been working on buying the property and improving the Boston and Maine Railroad route to add more trails, but only recently has an agreement been reached.
 Funding is proceeding, such as over $2,000 raised in a November fundraiser, but the bulk of funds will come from other sources, including a possible state agency grant.
 The tunnel will need some work and, once acquired, will initially be blocked off until any repairs are completed, Hodge said, taking into account advice from the town police and fire departments. So no tunnel parties, haunted tours or echoes will be possible until the tunnel is set to be added back to the trail that will be developed.
 At the spring town meeting, voters will decide on an article to purchase the four parcels totaling about 11 acres.
 But taxpayers can rest easy since the plan is to have the Trust match the grant funds, with the town eventually being reimbursed while owning the property.
 "The town would be putting money up front, but we would pay the match" needed for the grant, Hodge said.
 The overall purchase price of $110,400 from the town would be reimbursed, using an $88,320 MassTrails Grant from the Mass. Department of Conservation and Recreation and $22,080 from the Clinton Greenway Conservation Trust. The project cost, including purchase, engineering and other expenses, is estimated at over $160,000.
 "It's amazing," Selectman Michael Dziokonski said. "It's obvious a lot of people are walking there even now." He said there is a lot of opportunity, once the town gets the land, to have it developed as a trail and get the tunnel fixed up.
 Selectmen approved a letter of support to include with the grant application due next week.
 "This is really long-range planning at its best," Dziokonski said, with the plan for a trail from Northampton to Boston.
 Locally, he said, there would be a lot of traffic on the trails, a potential asset for town businesses.
 He also suggested lobbying to the get the causeway open over the dam as part of the trail.
 "With the tunnel, (the causeway) would be a huge draw," Dziokonski said.
 Downtown project
 While work moves forward on creating more trails for recreational walking, downtown Clinton is preparing for High Street improvements that focus on walking, prioritizing pedestrians.
 Phil Duffy, director of the Community and Economic Development Office, said the project is still on target and on budget. The project is slated to go out to bid by the end of February, with construction dependent on the bids. It could be more than one season of work, he said.
 Selectmen debated the High Street bump outs, originally built for business delivery use, with Selectman Ed Devault questioning the need for the wider areas, which also prevent some parking.
 But McGown explained that the bump outs were sought by the downtown businesses that had lobbied for them years ago when they were installed in another renovation project.
 Some practical considerations also enter into the equation.
 One is that removing bump outs only gains a space or two each, since some bump out is need for the crosswalks in an effort to ensure pedestrian safety. The idea is to get the pedestrians closer to the crossing in a protected area, rather than suddenly appearing from between parked cars.
 In addition, obstacles such as hydrants and alleys limit the amount of space that could be gained.
 Devault asked about eliminating the crosswalks midway between Union and Church streets, which would require pedestrians to walk to either of those intersections to cross High Street at crosswalks.
 "We have to weigh the need for a safe crossing in that area," McGown said. "No one is going to walk to Church Street to cross. You're still going to have people darting across the road. Because it's so busy in that stretch, we would maintain that crosswalk," McGown said.
 He said delivery trucks use the bump outs so as to not impede traffic.
 "We want downtown to be vibrant," he said, without traffic impediments and with safe pedestrian options.
 "We can't treat this as a strip mall," Selectman Sean Kerrigan said. "It's not that kind of place.
 "The only way it will be a success is if we design this people first," Kerrigan said. He said benefits of the plan included trees to cool the area in summer and lights so it is safer.
 McGown said there are usually parking spaces further down on High Street open, which they could use if they felt comfortable walking.
 "The lighting is by far the biggest part of the project," McGown said, and can help people "enjoy the walk."
 Devault also noted enforcement of parking targeting people who should not be parking there and paths from parking lots with better lighting.
 "We're hoping to light up some of those pathways," Dziokonski said.
 Electric connections will be ready to go as part of the project, McGown said, so that only getting permission from property owners along the paths would be an obstacle to lighting the alleys and paths.
 The board also accepted the Complete Streets grant award for $282,575 for Water Street area work including sidewalk and curbing upgrades.

WORCESTER -- The owner of a traveling zoo headed here, whose elephant died during the Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield last fall, defended his record amid growing scrutiny from animal rights groups.
 R.W. Commerford & Sons Traveling Petting Zoo, of Goshen, Connecticut, will be at the DCU Center from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Feb. 1 and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 2.
 Animal rights groups remain up in arms about the death of one of Commerford's elephants at the Big E on Sept. 15.
 Tim Commerford, owner of the traveling zoo, said the 54-year-old elephant died of a massive heart attack. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the cause of death was unknown.
 Commerford said his animals are treated kindly.
 Commerford said he typically does not consent to media interviews, but he suggested he was so fed up with "false propaganda," he spoke at length about the allegations.
 He said the elephant, Beulah, had been in his family for 47 years, his father having bought her from a game farm in Mendon. It was just a family hobby at the time.
 "We didn't call the Indian government and say, 'Go capture an elephant for us to do photo shoots or take her to the Girl Scouts camp for educational programs,' " he said.
 As the family acquired additional animals, the hobby turned into a business.
 He said Beulah never performed tricks because she wasn't good at them.
 The deceased elephant, he said, was used mainly for still photography or as an education tool for groups. The owner maintained Beulah died of a massive heart attack while on display at the Big E for photo opportunities.
 "She's been retired from giving any rides for over two years," he said.
 Activists are asking residents not to attend the show and to contact their state representative or senator to urge them to support a bill that would ban traveling zoos from using wild animals in Massachusetts.
 The bill focuses on elephants, big cats, primates, bears and giraffes because they suffer the most in traveling shows and are the greatest threat to the public, said Elizabeth Magner, animal advocacy specialist for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
 Magner said traveling zoos are "archaic, abusive toward animals, inhumane and dangerous to the public." She said that their behind-the-scenes training to do tricks is brutal and to a large degree unregulated as the animals are kept in small quarters for long periods of time and "dragged around the country."
 Sheryl Becker, president of the Western Massachusetts Animal Rights Advocates, said she expects 15 to 20 protesters outside the DCU on both days of the show.
 The demonstrators, she said in a statement, will "educate the public about the cruelty of using animals in traveling petting zoos, especially wild animals." She said Commerford Petting Zoo has 50 violations, accidents and injuries on file with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 The violations date to 1989. The most recent was in 2017, when the USDA cited Commerford for failing to provideBeulah, who was in need of foot care, with adequate veterinary services.
 Magner said that while the foot care violation may sound insignificant to a casual observer, it is a big deal because of how heavy elephants are. As they walk on concrete while in captivity, a foot ailment can quickly turn into a serious disorder, become infected and spread to the bone.
 At the Big E, the same Commerford elephant collapsed and died on the third day of the exposition. It was unable to stand the day before, according to the WMARA.
 The MSPCA official said Beulah's death was particularly sad as fairgoers saw it and took photos and videos. MSPCA received numerous phone calls and emails from supporters and others who were concerned and upset, Magner said.
 The proposed state law to ban traveling zoos was advanced by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Arts and Cultural Development last month. Versions are before the Senate and House Ways & Means committees.
 Braintree, Cambridge, Mendon, Quincy, Pittsfield, Plymouth, Provincetown, Revere, Somerville, Topsfield and Weymouth have adopted local rules banning traveling zoos from using wild animals. New York, Hawaii, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island as well as more than 40 countries have done the same.
 "We really feel like it's high time that these acts are no longer allowed in the state," Magner of the MSPCA said.
 With the 2017 shuttering of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Magner said, many people are surprised that shows by smaller businesses still occur in Massachusetts.
 She added that USDA inspections are infrequent and "just the bare minimum is required to essentially keep the animal alive and going."
 Speaking about the USDA violations over the years, Commerford suggested none involved mistreatment of animals.
 "After a snowstorm, there's two front gates that come into our farm, and we didn't have one shoveled out," he said. "So that's a violation. A cobweb in the barn could be a violation. A lid off a feed barrel in the feed room can be a violation.
 "We've never had one animal abuse citation," he said. "Our record is 100% clean that way. So, I mean, this is all a bunch of false propaganda to push their side across ... I'm about fed up with it because they're a bag of lies."
 As for the notion that the company prioritized financial interests over the welfare of its animals and the public, Commerford said his company's amusement rides and attractions pay for most of the animals' needs.
 Of his more than 300 animals, about 100 are retired and never leave the farm, Commerford said.
 "We don't take them to the auction and sell them for glue," he said. "We keep them. They go out to pasture, and however long they live, that's fine with us. They're pets. It'd be ruthless to get rid of your dog when he needs you the most. That's who we are. That's the truth."
 Asked about the venue's comfort level hosting Commerford, DCU Center general manager Sandy Dunn said: "From our perspective, we don't determine what people will or won't like, and what can or can't be booked here. We're a public building. We're open to anyone who's interested in booking the facility, as long as they follow the laws, as long as they obey the rules of the building and they fulfill their financial obligations."
 This will be Commerford's 16th year at the DCU Center.
 "They have a long track record with us," Dunn said. "They're good clients. Over 7,000 people attend the event, so that in and of itself is kind of a ringing endorsement of people interested in coming to this event. So there would be no reason why we would not book the event."

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday allowed 300 schools run by the Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools society to run their operations at the senior secondary level without having to pay any additional charges to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), whether by way of Floor Area Ratio (FAR) charges or otherwise.
 Justice C Hari Shankar directed the DDA to modify lease deeds, executed with the society, to the said effect. It, however, clarified that the right of the societies to run their institutions at the senior secondary level would not be conditional or dependent, upon such modifications.
 The move, affecting around 300 schools in the national capital, came after the society had moved to the Delhi High Court challenging the move of the DDA seeking additional FAR charges from primary and middle schools who, consequent to the modified recognition granted by the Directorate of Education (DoE) and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), are functioning at the senior secondary level.
 While stating that no additional charges would be taken, the court added, "It is hoped, fondly, that in future cases, statutory authorities such as the DDA, the DoE and the CBSE would avoid adopting conflicting stands, with respect to the functioning of educational institutions so that in the ultimate analysis, the right to education is in a position to prosper and thrive."
 "One must bear in mind the fact that, at the end of the day, the voiceless students are the ones who are sacrificed, in the tussle between the bureaucracy and the educational institutions. In a welfare state, such as ours, this in unthinkable," the judge added.
 Appearing for the society, its senior advocate Amit Sibal and advocate Kamal Gupta had said that despite clear instructions having been circulated by the DDA allowing such upgradation, subject to the schools having the requisite land area, the DDA is not justified for seeking additional charges.
 The court said the DDA stand was "completely unreasonable" and amounted to "an attempt to take away with the left hand that which is given with the right".
 "We will have to get details and then decide. However, we support education and if this helps in providing affordable education, the DDA may consider accepting," said a DDA official.

 WORCESTER - For the second night in a row, Worcester Catholic Schools administration sought to reassure parents that they expect the merger of Holy Name High School with St. Peter-Marian High School to go smoothly.
 At a forum Thursday night at St. Peter-Marian, Worcester Catholic Schools Superintendent David Perda and Michael Clark, associate superintendent of secondary schools, had few concrete answers, but said they will keep parents updated as the plan to merge the schools moves forward in the face of continued enrollment declines and financial pressure on the diocese.
 The administration held a similar forum Wednesday night at Holy Name. The schools will merge but the decision of which campus will asborb the other remains up in the air.
 That uncertainty led to questions from parents and students Thursday night that touched on broad themes like identity, morale, and recruitment, and that started to delve into more practical areas, like which school students will say they've graduated from, whether parents will have to buy new uniforms, and how the merger will affect timelines for financial aid and re-enrollment.
 Perda said the uncertainty introduced into each school's community with the December announcement of the merger wasn't lost on him. But he said he hopes the situation will come into better focus soon, hinting at a decision on which campus will remain by late February or early March. He said the administration is already working with engineers, architects and consultants to fully assess the strengths and weaknesses of each campus.
 Closing one of the schools could impact commute times and transportation needs. A parent asked if accommodations could be made to provide transportation to students living in towns north of Worcester if Holy Name is chosen as the preferrred location; Clark said if the need presents itself the new school could support that type of transportation.
 Clark said the New England Association of Schools and Colleges has already offered an extension to the district. He said both schools were up for NEASC reviews this year. He said both schools are in good standing with the accrediting organization.
 Clark said he doesn't anticipate a reduction in Advanced Placement offerings at the new school. In fact, he said that based on enrollment, the new combined school could actually increase its offerings. That economy of scale could extend to extracurricular activities, too, he pointed out.
 A Holy Name student asked what school he will put down when he applies to college, Holy Name, or the new, as-yet-unnamed school. Clark said the first graduating class, in 2021, will have the name of the new school on its diplomas. Another parent later in the meeting pointed out that she went through a similar situation with her daughter at St. Bernard's in Fitchburg. She said her daughter had transferred to St. Bernard's from another school and then transferred to St. Peter-Marian. She didn't have any trouble explaining that during the college admissions process, and her daughter got in to the College of the Holy Cross, the woman said.
 Some parents said the process already seems rushed, and asked why it couldn't be stretched out over a two-year period. Perda said that was considered, but said two years would mean a prolonged period of uncertainty during which enrollment could be impacted even more.
 Parents were also concerned about teacher morale ahead of possible redundancies after the merger. Clark shot down a rumor that four teachers at Holy Name have left since the announcement; he said three of the four \"in- year departures\" took place before the merger was announced. Perda said the faculty has been supportive, and said the union representing them has expressed a willingness to work with the administration.
 The administrators were asked why the diocese couldn't think a little more long-term and build a brand-new school on one of the campuses. Perda explained earlier in the meeting that the proceeds of the sale of whatever campus will no longer be used will be re-invested in the form of improvements to the new combined school. But he said the diocese simply can't afford a new facility.

India and Brazil are both regional powers within their own region and share similar developmental challenges. They were once known as 'emerging powers' in world affairs, and along with Japan and Germany, aspire to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. India and Brazil also co- operate in multilateral forums such as IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa) and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). Over the years, BRICS has become an important grouping and is attempting to redefine international economic order with initiatives such as the New Development Bank. For India, IBSA is, in fact, a more logical framework for furthering South-South co-operation and strengthening security partnership in the form of joint exercises and military training. In this visit, the revival of IBSA should be on the cards.

Deep-sea explorers scouring the world’s oceans for sunken Second World War ships are focusing on debris fields deep in the Pacific, in an area where one of the most decisive battles of the time took place.
 Weeks of grid searches around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands already have led the crew of the Petrel to one sunken warship, the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga. This week, the crew is deploying equipment to investigate what could be another.
 “When you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,” said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, D.C., who is onboard the Petrel.
 Until now, only one of the seven ships that went down in the June 1942 air and sea battle — five Japanese vessels and two American — had been located.
 The expedition is an effort started by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. For years, the crew has worked with the U.S. Navy and other officials to find and document sunken ships. The Petrel has found 31 vessels so far. This is the first time it has looked for warships from the Battle of Midway, which took place six months after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbour.
 The attack from the Japanese Imperial Navy was meant to be a surprise, a strike that would give Japan a strategic advantage in the Pacific. It was thwarted when U.S. analysts decoded Japanese messages and baited their enemy into revealing its plan.
 As Japanese warplanes started bombing the military installation at Midway Atoll, a tiny group of islands about 2,090 km northwest of Honolulu, U.S. forces were already on their way to intercept Japan’s fleet. U.S. planes sank four of Japan’s aircraft carriers and a cruiser, and downed dozens of its fighter planes.
 One of the American ships lost was the USS Yorktown, an aircraft carrier that was heavily damaged and being towed by the U.S. on the battle’s final day when it was hit by torpedoes. The other, the USS Hammann, went down trying to defend the Yorktown.
 Retired Navy Capt. Jack Crawford, who recently turned 100, was among the Yorktown’s 2,270 survivors.
 Japanese dive bombers left the Yorktown badly damaged, with black smoke gushing from its stacks, but the vessel was still upright.
 Then the torpedoes hit, Crawford told by telephone from his home in Maryland.
 “Bam! Bam! We get two torpedoes, and I know we’re in trouble. As soon as the deck edge began to go under, I knew . she wasn’t going to last,” said Capt. Crawford, whose later military career was with the naval nuclear propulsion program. He also served as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear energy in the Department of Energy.
 The Yorktown sank slowly, and a destroyer was able to pick up Crawford and many others.
 In May 1998, almost 56 years later, an expedition led by the National Geographic Society in conjunction with the U.S. Navy found the Yorktown 5 km below the surface.
 Capt. Crawford doesn’t see much value in these missions to find lost ships, unless they can get some useful information on how the Japanese ships went down. But he wouldn’t mind if someone was able to retrieve his strongbox and the brand-new sword he left in it when he and others abandoned ship 77 years ago.
 A piece of the Japanese aircraft carrier was discovered in 1999, but its main wreckage was still missing until last week.
 After receiving some promising sonar readings, the Petrel used underwater robots to investigate and get video. It compared the footage with historical records and confirmed this week it had found the Kaga.
 “On the occasion of the discovery of the Kaga, we send our thoughts and prayers to our trusted and valued friends in Japan,” said Rear Adm. Brian P. Fort, commander of U.S. Naval Forces in Japan. “The terrible price of war in the Pacific was felt by all our navies. From that painful lesson, we have become the closest of allies and friends committed to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
 The other three Japanese aircraft carriers the Akagi, Soryu and Hiryu and the Japanese cruiser Mikuma are still unaccounted for.
 The Petrel crew hopes to find and survey all the wreckage from the battle, an effort that could add new details about Midway to history books.
 Earlier this year, they discovered the USS Hornet, an aircraft carrier that helped win the Battle of Midway but sank in the Battle of Santa Cruz near the Solomon Islands less than five months later. More than 100 crew members died.
 The Petrel also discovered the USS Indianapolis, the U.S. Navy’s single deadliest loss at sea.
 Rob Kraft, director of subsea operations on the Petrel, says Allen gave him and his crew a mission to preserve history, educate people about the past and honor those who fought on these great ships. Allen died last year.
 “This originally started with his desire to honor his father’s service to our country,” Kraft said. “It really extends beyond that at this time. We’re honoring today’s service members, it’s about education and, you know, bringing history back to life for future generations.”

According to reports, senators are struggling to stay awake. It's the best part of all this. Elizabeth Warren spotted playing a game on a piece of paper. Dianne Feinstein left the trial over an hour early.
 Area 51 conspiracy theorist Roswell Rachel Maddow and her well panel of conspiracy theorists, they're angry. They're pleading now, begging the Democrats, their friends in the Senate, please pay attention, fake it, fake enthusiasm for the sake of the country, fake it.
 Wow. After all, she's been lying to her viewers for three years, just like the congenital liar. First, those Russia collusion, the hoax. Now, she's filling her viewers heads with these far-fetched fantasies about Trump in Ukraine -- more lies, more propaganda, more false hope, and the viewers are about to be let down spectacularly all over again.
 Now, unlike MSDNC, fake news CNN, they're obsessed -- by the way, there are some guys on fake news CNN, Humpty-Dumpty and his -- I don't know Humpty Dumpty and want to be some guy named Oliver, they stalked us. They should focus on their own failing network and their own failing shows.
 We have been right every step of the way. They should report that. Tonight, I could easily cut through all the B.S. and tell you the truth, now I'm getting serious, because this is hurting the country. Funny but serious.
 We know how this ends. We know the president will be acquitted. They are helping him. At this hour, 45 Republicans are ready to dismiss all these stupid charges by doing some pretty basic math. That means there are not anywhere near the 67 votes that would be required to convict, with just five more votes, this charade will immediately come to an end.
 And now, the Democrats, they have managed to offend at least one of those swing votes and that would be Senator Lisa Murkowski. Yes, I think Donald Trump helped Alaska and with opening up oil there helps her state.
 She's angry, rightfully so, the House impeachment managers accuse the Senate of a cover-up.
 Now, you have representatives, you have senators. There's a few weak Republican senators that are probably still wavering. You need to let your senator know how you feel about you -- their decision here, that they should not be validating what has been a corrupt, unconstitutional crisis that they are putting this country to, an ordeal, it is hurting the country.
 This article of impeachment is a farce. It's all politics. They have hated Donald Trump and that's all they've done every second, minute, hour of every hour day for three long years. And by the way, no crimes, no misdemeanor, there's no bribery, no reason. The House didn't even bother to subpoena the so-called witnesses that they're saying the Senate must subpoena.
 If you make a crime out of going to the courts when there's a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch and you go to the judicial branch, and you say, oh, we're invoking executive privilege which can be traced back to George Washington, you'd be destroying the power of the presidency and spitting on the Constitution. That's serious.
 And it's clear that the Schumer Schiff sham show is nothing more than partisan hackery and revenge. They have been dreaming about impeachment since 2016. If I had time, I'd run the tape again.
