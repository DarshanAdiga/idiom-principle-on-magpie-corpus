Two Richmond players were arrested at 3.30am on Friday after they allegedly became embroiled in a physical altercation outside a strip club in Surfers Paradise. The Courier-Mail has identified the pair. A Queensland Police spokesperson said both men sustained facial industries, and had been issued with a banning notice, which excludes them from Gold Coast nightclub district. They have both also been stung with a fine for public nuisance. Investigations are ongoing, but Liberal National Party leader Deb Frecklington said it showed “bad judgment” that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk “trusted these sporting stars to do the right thing”. “Annastacia Palaszczuk rolled out the red carpet for AFL players, officials and their families while everyday Australians with critical medical conditions have been ignored,” Ms Frecklington said. “If two players from the special AFL hub were in a strip club and then involved in a late-night brawl, then they should be sent back to Victoria.“Reckless behaviour like this puts the lives and livelihoods of Queenslanders at risk.”An AFL spokesman said the league was “aware of the matter and is currently investigation”. It comes as Queenslanders slam the “double standard” of strict border measures, which allowed 400 Victorian-based AFL contingents to quarantine in a luxury resort ahead of the October 24 grand final at the Gabba.

KILN, Miss. (WLOX) - Three days separate the Hancock Hawks from a new season.“They’re excited, you know. We’re all excited that it’s finally game week and we can actually play ball this week,” fourth-year head coach Neil Lollar told WLOX.However, three wins would’ve had them squarely in the playoff picture. Their 4-7 record in 2019 is a bit misleading when considering the fact they fell to Harrison Central in overtime and lost to Gulfport by only three.“We were a few plays away in about three ball games. I’m sure every coach could’ve said the same to a certain extent,” Lollar said. “Fourth quarter and we had a turnover or a mishap or something, you know? Some fine tuning on that and if we do I think those three wins would be there.”The win total should improve this year with quarterback Sema’J Robertson back for his senior season. After leading the team in total yardage with 1804, the dual-threat athlete is prepared for year two with the Hawks.“Run my reads. Like my reads and all that stuff,” Robertson said. “Ball security, so that’s really all I had to do last year.”“We ran him last year and we were able to throw and use our backs to accent,” Lollar added. “He’s allowed us to be able to expand a little bit our offense and have a few different things we were not able to do last year or even the year before.”The Hawks will be young up front, having just one returning starter for the offensive line. They will likely look to their veteran defensive line for depth to start the season.“It’s pure speed from what we had before, everybody’s quicker on both sides of the line actually. Speed is where we’re at right now, we’re quick now,” junior defensive end Da’Kyre Smith told WLOX. “Hancock prides itself on doing a lot of conditioning. Fourth quarter is our quarter. When all the teams are gassed out, that’s when we really punch it.”However, the biggest playmaker won’t be taking the field. The Hawks recently moved into their new state-of- the-art field house, a motivating factor for not just this season, but for the future of the program.“Everything in there is just luxury, you know. From the lockers to the new training room. More guys can get their reps in,” Smith said. “I’m glad that we can experience what those older guys put there for us, but yeah just luxury.”“They’re going to feel the H man, they’re going to feel the H,” Robertson said.The Hawks open up the 2020 season on September 4th at Gautier and seek to put an end to their streak of back-to-back 4-7 seasons.Copyright 2020 WLOX.

He is captured by the enemy, tortured and beaten and eventually is taken to a remote facility and introduced to the concept of inverted objects. We look at an object and it is traveling forward through time along with us. That’s obvious from elementary school science class. But what if an object could go in the other direction through history instead? Apparently, objects have been doing exactly this, and the Powers That Be need to control it because if a bullet could be sent back through time, what happens if a nuclear weapon takes the same trip?
 Teaming up with a mysterious partner named Neil (a charming Robert Pattinson), our hero tracks inverted objects to a villainous Russian arms dealer named Andrei (Kenneth Branagh). To get closer to this mega-wealthy madman, The Protagonist uses Andrei’s wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), who loathes her abusive husband but is being blackmailed into staying with him via threats that she will lose her son if she doesn’t do exactly what he says.
 On a very basic level, “Tenet” is about the extremes of unmonitored power. When one becomes so rich and powerful that they can literally shape world events, why not try to shape world history too? Sound a little familiar? Andrei is very much cut from the same cloth as classic Bond villains, complete with unchecked opulence, Russian accent and snarling line delivery. Blend Nolan’s obsession with time-twisting high concepts and his love of classic action construction and you have some idea what “Tenet” feels like.
 The film itself is very much like this for its entirety and thus, the view must be intent on following the story from the beginning in order to not be lost or misdirected as many of Nolan's movies can do. If you can stay on track throughout, it is a film that will keep you entertained from the beginning.
 Tenet started at the Blackfoot Movie Mill on Monday and will likely have a fairly long run, but don't waste any time in getting to the show, just in case you feel the need to view it a second or third time to really capture the essence of the movie.
 As always, we encourage you to visit the Blackfoot Movie Mill at their website in order to find the exact dates and show-times for the film that you want to see. You will also be able to reserve your favorite seat in order to enhance the viewing of the show and that always is a plus when watching a good movie.
 I rate this show a 4.5 on a scale of 1-5, but you must really follow the show to capture its full intent.

BEIJING (AP) — An American newspaper says one of its journalists was detained and then expelled from China’s Inner Mongolia region while covering tensions over a new policy that reduces the use of the Mongolian language in education.
 The Los Angeles Times said in a story published online Thursday that the reporter was interrogated at a police station, grabbed by the throat and pushed into a cell and held for more than four hours before being forced to leave the northern Chinese region.
 The incident comes amid broader tensions between the U.S. and China over journalists stationed in each other's country.
 The reporter was surrounded by plainclothes men at a school in Hohhot, the region's capital, and put into a police car to be taken to a police station, according to the account. It says she was not allowed to call the U.S. Embassy.
 “One officer grabbed her throat with both hands and pushed her into a cell,” the story says.
 Three government officials and a police officer went with her to a train station and stood at the window until the train left for Beijing, the Los Angeles Times said.

The Sri Lanka Navy, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard are currently working together to control the fire that erupted after an explosion of a boiler in the main engine room of MT New Diamond, an oil tanker sailing 38 nautical miles off Sangamankanda Point east of Sri Lankan seas, around 8.00 a.m. on 03rd September 2020. Accordingly, an MI 17 helicopter of Sri Lanka Air Force carried out several aerial operations, until the sunset of the previous day, in which water being spilled on the ship caught fire to control the flames. Meanwhile, a beach craft is conducting periodic air surveillance and a Dornier aircraft of the Indian Coast Guard also monitored the disaster situation from the air. Further, Sri Lanka Navy Ships Sayura, Sindurala and Ranarisi with 02 Fast Attack Craft have been deployed in this disaster management operation. The Indian Coast Guard Ship "Shaurya" which arrived at the location of the distressed oil tanker in the evening hours of 03rd September 2020, joined hands with the Sri Lanka Navy Ship ‘Sindurala’ in carrying out the cooling effect from both sides of the ship in distress. The mission was also augmented by two tugs ‘Rawana’ and ‘Wasamba’ at 1.00 a.m and 3.00 a.m. respectively after leaving the Hambantota port this morning (04th September). Around 2.00 hrs, the mission was also joined by the ALP ‘Winger’ another tug made ready by the foreign company that owns the ship in distress. Apart from that, the Indian Navy Ship (INS) ‘Sahyadri’ joined the disaster management operation this morning around 2.00 a.m. and two (02) other Indian Coast Guard ships are scheduled to join the operation by today’s (04th September) afternoon. The two Russian ships that took part in the disaster relief operation left the scene of action after providing necessary support, in the evening of 03rd September. Meanwhile, 21 crew members of the distressed oil tanker including the 19 persons, whom were initially retrieved by the MV Helen M were taken aboard SLN ships and have been safely isolated adhering to health guidelines. The health condition of the third engineering officer of the ship who was admitted to the Kalmunai Hospital after sustaining injuries is also returning to stable condition as of now. As such, the Sri Lanka Navy has rescued 22 of the 23 crew members aboard the oil tanker, however the preliminary information from the ship's crew confirmed that a Filipino seaman onboard had died in a boiler explosion. Furthermore, the fire on the ship has so far had no effect on the 270,000 metric tons of crude oil stored there and necessary steps are being taken to prevent the fire from spreading to those crude oil storage facilities. Meanwhile, there is still no risk of the ship leaking oil into the ocean due to the unfortunate turn of events. However, Sri Lanka Navy, the Sri Lanka Coast Guard, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the Marine Environment Protection Authority and other stakeholders are geared up to take necessary steps to mitigate and manage the risk of possible oil spill in future due to this disaster. The distressed oil tanker is now at sea at a depth of 3100 meters, about 25 nautical miles (approximately 50 km) off the shore by 5.00 a.m. this morning. Further, 03 main ships of the Sri Lanka Navy, 02 Fast Attack Craft, 01 Indian Coast Guard Ship, 01 Indian Navy Ship and 03 tugs are near the distressed vessel at 5.30 a.m. Firefighting will also resume by air from 5.30 a.m. this morning.

El ministro de Universidades, Manuel Castells, apuesta por un nuevo curso universitario con la maxima presencialidad, en clase o a traves de videoconferencia, a la vez que ha reconocido que no existe un _plan B_ para la Universidad, sino que "hay que sobrevivir a las condiciones de la epidemia". El ministro reitero que "si hay confinamiento las universidades sobreviviremos como podamos" en una rueda de prensa telematica junto al presidente de los rectores CRUE, Jose Carlos Gomez Villamandos, para detallar las medidas acordadas con el fin de garantizar la seguridad del curso que va a comenzar frente a la covid.
 "El _plan B_ no existe: es sobrevivir a las condiciones que nos encontramos", declaro Castells. Sin embargo, ha coincidido con el presidente de la CRUE en asegurar que estamos en mejores condiciones que en el curso anterior, tanto por la capacidad telematica como por la experiencia y la formacion de los docentes para las clases _online_.
 El ministro insto a "estar preparados para una agravacion de la epidemia" y "no volver a estar desprevenidos", mientras matizaba que "a dia de hoy" no hay estado de alarma ni una situacion como la de la pasada primavera. Ademas, ha anunciado que se va a garantizar la calidad de todas las universidades. Precisamente, la semana proxima se reune con las agencias de calidad para acordar "criterios homogeneos" y que no disminuya esa garantia en una universidad respecto a otra.
 Por ello, cuando no se de el caso de la distancia de seguridad, los alumnos se turnaran para asistir presencialmente al aula o seguir la clase _online_. Tambien existe la posibilidad de seguir desde una "aula espejo", es decir, una al lado por videoconferencia, como esta haciendo la Universidad Publica de Navarra. Pero todos tendran las mismas posibilidades de "presencialidad", auguro Manuel Castells.
 El presidente de los rectores explico que la mascarilla es obligatoria, asi como la distancia de 1,5 metros de seguridad dentro de las aulas, y la necesidad de ventilar las clases antes y despues de las enseñanzas. No se tomara la temperatura, ya que las personas se mueven continuamente por espacios amplios, pero ha llamado a la "responsabilidad" individual de las personas, que saben si tienen fiebre o se encuentran mal. Y ha instado a que los alumnos cumplan con las recomendaciones sanitarias.
 Villamandos hizo hincapie en la necesidad de que desaparezca la brecha digital, que se detecto en el alumnado, por lo que ha asegurado que se buscara financiacion otra vez para que todos los alumnos cuenten con equipos telematicos. Por otra parte, Castells ha recordado que se esta trabajando para derogar el reglamento de disciplina academica de los centros oficiales de Enseñanza Superior y Enseñanza Tecnica, "un decreto franquista del año 1954, que es simplemente un atentado a los derechos humanos". Y subrayo que se va a derogar pero que habra un desarrollo normativo para la mediacion de los conflictos dentro de las universidades.

After years of research, including one-on-one conversations with farmers, a businessperson from Kansas invented a new type of fertilizer toolbar.
   
 Although he grew up in diverse pockets of the world, Daniel Rauchholz, president of the newly formed Farmada, married a woman from Kansas and decided to make the Sunflower State home.
   
 Rauchholz previously traveled the world as an export manager for a top agricultural equipment company. Then, last year, he took the step to branch out on his own. Unfortunately, COVID-19 hit, but Rauchholz plowed ahead and opened his Assaria-based company, just south of Salina, this spring.
   
 Rauchholz' company, Farmada, developed a fertilizer toolbar that can apply anhydrous ammonia, liquid fertilizer, dry fertilizers, nitrogen stabilizers or any combination of these compounds into the ground. With the help of two manufacturers -- one in South Hutchinson and the other in Salina -- the company is able to produce this toolbar.
   
 The ground engaging components are sourced from ShieldAg Equipment out of South Hutchinson. Other components come from Salina-based Grain Belt Supply. Rauchholz said both companies provide knowledge and support.
   
 "They (Shield Ag) have years of experience, and more importantly, they have components that work very successfully in various ground and farming conditions," Rauchholz said. "We didn't feel we needed to reinvent the wheel, when ShieldAg already had exactly what the market needed."
   
 ShieldAg, which has been in business for more than 50 years, is honored to work with other Kansas-based companies in supplying farmers worldwide with Kansas-made products.
   
 "We worked together," said Mike Bergmeier, owner and president of ShieldAg. "That way, the dealers can stay inventing."
   
 The Farmada toolbar, which is tractor driven, has hitch extensions and can handle diverse ground conditions. The company's model Elxir64 is available with 15, 16 or 17 rows at 30-inch row spacing or from 35-40 feet working width. It also has a commercial grade Elxir66 that comes in three sizes and working widths. These are available from 18 to 26 rows at 30-inch row spacing.
   
 In addition, the machines are flexible. If there is rough terrain, it must still place the fertilizer into the soil at the correct depth. By having long wing flexes, the machines are able to travel over hilly or rutted ground and move up and down with the terrain while placing the fertilizer at the pre-set depth.
   
 "To put this into perspective, the outside wing of the 60-foot unit can flex down 125 inches and up 139 inches," Rauchholz said. "Another key feature is our oscillating axles."
   
 By incorporating farmer-driven ideas, he said, Farmada is able to produce a machine that farmers want.
   
 "The Farmada team is taking what the crop needs, what the farmer wants, what the field and road conditions will be and converting that into machines that allow farmers to improve productivity, reduce cost and improve their bottom line," he said. "You have to benchmark or compete against the best practices."
   
 Rauchholz said the new dynamic in farming is that the farmer is no longer competing against their neighbors, they are competing in a world market, and he wants to give them the best equipment to do the job.
   
 "We want to keep strengths and eliminate weaknesses," Rauchholz said. "It's key for farmers to apply the latest technologies to stay competitive."

The fear of the virus has affected the education system for all ages of students. Dr. Kenny Southwick, Executive Director of Cooperating School Districts of Greater Kansas City, who represents thirty-one school districts, said, "COVID is not a school problem, but a problem that has been thrust on all our schools." However, it remains educators' main priority to keep the community safe while providing top education. Because little guidance was given from the federal or local government, decisions on how to best navigate the school year varied from district to district. While some fully face to face made possible because of families who have chosen to go virtual, others are going completely virtual. Dr. Southwick said that to keep schools open at the end of that day, there needs to be a higher level of community responsibility. Community members must do their part to slow the virus's spread by social distancing and masking up, so schools don't find themselves in the same situation as last spring.

 The team announced Thursday it is moving its Sept. 12 home match against Real Monarchs SLC to Salt Lake City, a direct response to the organization’s effort to remain compliant with the state’s health orders with its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions currently prohibit large gatherings of people, which makes any kind of live sporting event impossible for the time being.
 The United (6-2-2) have played all 10 of their matches on the road this season and will have at least two more on the road as plans for home dates this weekend against El Paso and Sept. 12 against Real Monarchs SLC have been rearranged. New Mexico’s earliest chance for a home game is now Sept. 19 against Colorado Springs.

The schism between the two Hindu modes of engaging with food—Vedic (eater and eaten) and the later emphasis on purity and asceticism—helps us understand the assumptions underpinning belligerent calls for ‘vegetarian only’ canteens in newspaper offices. 2014 was a momentous year for this issue. First, questioning Shirdi Sai Baba’s status as a Hindu god, Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati said that Sai Baba was someone ‘who used to eat meat and worshipped Allah...a man like that can never be a Hindu god’. Furious devotees of Sai Baba led a PIL in the Supreme Court but the court prudently refused to intervene. In November of 2014, an organisation associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sent a letter to the central government asking it to ensure that only vegetarian food was served to students in the canteen of the premier Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). This letter along with twenty others was forwarded to the directors of these institutions by the Modi- led BJP government, with a note asking them to consider separate eating areas.

As for the prevention of the import of external cases, it is no doubt necessary to ensure that border quarantine and management measures are properly in place. But this is a radically different idea from shutting down the borders. A border shutdown is a blanket arrangement that blocks all points of access; it is not a quarantine measure that is formulated according to the risk of the virus' entry. Early this year, when the disease broke out in mainland China, there were vocal calls in Hong Kong society for a border shutdown. More than half a year has passed, and there has been tremendous change in the pandemic situation around the world. However, even now there are still some people in Hong Kong who will not let go of the talk of a border shutdown. The third wave of infections is related to the exemption from quarantine arrangements for sailors. Some groups and individuals have again offered simplistic explanations of the matter, saying that a border shutdown is the ''most realistic'' way to combat the pandemic.
 Hong Kong is a small, highly open economy. To allow social and economic activities to return to normal sustainably amid the pandemic, it is necessary to keep its doors open appropriately. The key is to prioritise an effective management of viral risks to facilitate the travel of personnel. As for the outbreak of the third wave of infections, the crux of the matter was the permission of high-risk people from abroad, who were exempt from quarantine arrangements, to act freely in the communities.
 The ''Health Code'' system began in mainland China. Its operation carries two functions. The first is the real-time tracing of a patient's close contacts and those who are suspected to have caught the virus. The second is its use as a health risk certificate for people who are travelling. A green health code is a pass for cross-province transportation. It is also a permit that decides whether someone can enter some public premises or even use public transportation. In recent months, there has often been discussion about the ''Health Code''. However, what is referred to when talking about the ''Health Code'' can vary substantially from one person to another. Some people deem the ''Health Code'' as a tracing and surveillance tool that infringes personal privacy. Some people advocate the ''Health Code'' and suggest that those who test negative can enter Hong Kong restaurants and shopping malls for 14 days. In their eyes, the ''Health Code'' is a tool that restricts some people's entry into some specific premises. Such a practice is likely to give rise to discrimination and unfairness.
 According to the Hong Kong government, the development of the ''Hong Kong Health Code'' was completed long ago. Its introduction was suspended due to the third wave of infections. The government says that if the pandemic stabilises, the scheme will be launched in two weeks at the earliest. It will be used initially for the restoration of travel between Hong Kong, Macao and Guangdong Province, and will pave the way for the creation of ''travel bubbles'' with other regions. No doubt the ''Health Code'', as a customs arrangement for the exemption from quarantine and isolation, will definitely enable both inbound and outbound travel.
 The government earlier announced that more private testing organisations will be introduced. It remains uncertain whether the testing fee will be reduced significantly. It is a possibility that cannot be ruled out that some people, out of protectionism or political considerations, have acted behind the scenes to make sure that testing fees remain high. The government must look into the matter.
 明報社評 2020.09.02：港康碼通關利復常 再談封關不切實際
 普及社區檢測昨天正式展開，社會經濟活動如何重開復常，亦提上議事日程。
 控疫之道離不開「外防輸入內防擴散」。內防擴散，必須有一套強大的病毒檢測、追蹤和隔離治療系統，至於外防輸入，當然是做好關口檢疫及管理措施，然而這跟封關鎖港是截然不同的概念。封關是中斷出入孔道的一刀切安排，並非針對病毒輸入風險高低而制定的檢疫把關安排。今年初內地爆發疫情，香港社會封關呼聲甚響。事隔大半年，世界各地疫情變化翻天覆地，不過時至今日，本港仍有一些人將封關掛在嘴邊。本港第三波疫情與當局豁免海員檢疫有關，一些團體和人士又將問題簡化為「封關」，認為這才是「最實際」的防疫方法，云云。
 香港是高度開放小型經濟體，疫下社會經濟活動要可持續復常，總得適度打開門戶，以有效管控疫情風險為前提，便利人員往來。第三波疫情爆發，問題核心是任由高風險入境人士免檢疫在社區自由活動。
 「健康碼」制度始於內地，實際操作有兩重作用，一是實時追蹤密切接觸者或懷疑感染者，一是作為民眾出行的健康風險證明，綠色健康碼既是跨省市出入的通行證，也是能否出入某些公共場所甚至乘搭交通工具的「令牌」。近月本港社會不時有人討論「健康碼」，然而不同人口中的「健康碼」，可以是完全不同概念。有人視「健康碼」為追蹤監控工具，侵犯個人私隱；有人提倡引入「健康碼」，檢測陰性者可於14天內出入本港食肆商場，在他們眼中，「健康碼」是限制部分人出入指定場所的工具，有關做法很可能衍生歧視不公。
 根據港府說法，「港康碼」開發早已完成，惟因本港第三波疫情爆發才暫緩推行。當局表示，只要疫情穩定，最快兩周後推出，率先恢復香港與澳門及廣東之間的人流往來，並為未來與其他地區建立「旅遊氣泡」鋪路。當然，「健康碼」作為豁免檢疫隔離的通關安排，一定是「有來有往」。
 早前當局宣布引入更多私人檢測機構，收費能否顯著下降仍是未知之數，不排除有人出於業界保護主義甚或政治考慮，從中作梗令檢測收費居高不下，當局必須留意相關問題。

At one time, the money had been earmarked to help build I-73, but the county announced it also wanted to use the money to pay for public safety in county- only areas.
 During the back and forth between the county and municipal leaders, each maintained their support for I-73. Myrtle Beach has since created its own 1% hospitality fee to continue collection that stays in the city’s pockets rather than being sent to the county to divvy up.
 Although the terms of the settlement haven’t been released, county officials have said part of the contention is what to do with the $19 million collected in hospitality fees between the time the roads were paid off and the judge’s ruling that the county had to stop collecting the fee within municipal limits.
 The courts have been charged with deciding what to do with the $19 million, and that answer is expected to be in the settlement.
 On Thursday, Loris leaders met behind closed doors for about an hour and a half. The vote was unanimous, though council members Joan Gause and Terrence Hardee were not in attendance.
 The decision came a week after Loris officials postponed a vote on the agreement, citing questions about the way it was written.
 At that time, Loris Mayor Todd Harrelson said council members wanted the city’s attorney to get some more information, though he declined to elaborate on what they wished to know.
 By Thursday, he said those questions had been answered. He again, however, declined to give specifics.
 “We had some questions and got those questions answered,” he said. “That’s why it took so long. We just needed some answers to those questions. I feel fine about it.”
 Harrelson has said the agreement is different than the one Loris officials refused to even consider last year. The former proposal, he said, was centered around I-73.
 “It’s a better agreement than I thought before when we looked at it last time,” he said of the new deal. “I feel better about that.”
 County officials had pushed for a deal that would continue the collection of the 1.5% fee countywide with the revenues from each community going back to the jurisdictions where they were collected.
 Gardner, the county council chairman, said the deal will provide much needed funding to cash-strapped local governments.
 “That will free up a lot of money for Horry County, a lot of money for Myrtle Beach, North Myrtle Beach, Loris, Aynor, so on and so forth,” he said. “We can start trying to redo our budgets to make up for the lost revenue that this COVID has ravaged on this county.”

Near Madrid airport, an army of cranes works round the clock to build a new pandemic hospital which is expected to open in November.
 But a second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak is already under way in Spain, straining the capital's public health care system.
 Around 400 builders have been working round the clock since July to build the 45,000-square-metre (484,000-square-foot) Isabel Zendal hospital, which will be able to care for over 1,000 patients during a health emergency.
 Concrete mixers churn at full speed at the vast building site as welders set off sparks from the pillars which will form the backbone of building.
 "Two months ago there was nothing here," said Alejo Mirando, the director general of health infrastructure in hardest-hit Madrid region.
 The regional government of Madrid is spending over 50 million euros ($60 million) to build the hospital, which will have bay windows which will allow doctors to monitor patients without becoming contaminated and large halls without individual rooms.
 The architecture was designed to "avoid transmission" of viruses and it was inspired by the design of a temporary field hospital set up at Madrid's sprawling Ifema exhibition centre between March and May, said Mirando.
 The opening of the new hospital however will come too late to deal with a surge in infections in the Madrid region, which Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called "worrying".
 \- 'Verge of collapse' -
 Spain was one of the hardest-hit countries when the coronavirus struck Europe this year before a strict lockdown helped reduce the outbreak's spread.
 But infections have surged since the lockdown measures were fully removed at the end of June, especially in Madrid, with the rise in infections often linked to the return of nightlife and social gatherings.
 The region, which is home to around 6.5 million people, accounts for 73 of the 191 Covid-19 deaths recorded in Spain in the last seven days, and for nearly a third of the country's total toll of 29,000 deaths.
 The rapid pace of the rise in infections is "similar to that at the beginning of the pandemic," said Silvia Duran, a spokeswoman for doctors' union Amyts.
 Public health centres are so far managing to contain the second wave but hospitals are preparing for a rise in admissions, she added.
 Covid-19 patients already fill 16 percent of all hospital beds in Madrid, compared to just six percent nationwide.
 "We are on the verge of collapse," said Jose Molero of the Csit union, adding doctors are "exhausted" because they are seeing up to 60 patients per day.
 "The next stage will be when people go directly to the hospital because they can't be seen by their family doctor," he added.
 \- 'High risk area' -
 Densely populated Madrid, Spain's transport hub, is "a high risk area", the health ministry's emergencies director Fernando Simon said on Monday.
 While the Madrid region's deputy health chief, Antonio Zapatero, acknowledged that infections have risen during the past month and a half, he said the "situation is bearable at the moment".
 Governed by the conservative Popular Party, the region has taken up the leftist central government's offer to send soldiers to help track people who have been exposed to those infected with virus.
 But some health experts feel the region is still not doing enough.
 A doctors group is planning to file a lawsuit against the regional government while hundreds of other doctors have signed an open letter demanding that the regional government "act to avoid a new collapse" in the health system.
 Among the demands of health care workers is greater use of telemedicine.
 "It is us who are going to get sick," said Duran of doctors' union Amyts.
 She recalled that in April healthcare workers accounted for around 20 percent of all Covid-19 cases in Spain, the highest proportion in the world, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

URI Prof. Brad Wetherbee seems to think his favorite shark may need a better press agent.
   
 "Makos are like a high-performance car, like a Lamborghini. They're fast, fast, fast," he says, lightly pounding the rail of the boat for emphasis. "Certainly, these makos are impressive animals. They get to be 13 feet long and 1,400 pounds. They can catch about anything, whereas white sharks … they might be big and get in the news, but …" His voice drifts off.
   
 Wetherbee's enthusiasm for makos is why he continues to catch and tag them with transmitters in a project that he began back in 2004. It's also why he's up before dawn on this day to pilot the 35-foot URI boat Hope Hudner toward the waters between Point Judith and Block Island.
   
 "[Makos] start out down South," Wetherbee says. "In the winter, some of them are off the Carolinas. And then towards the end of May, or the middle of May, they start showing up in off Maryland. Then from May until June, they start moving up the coast, past New Jersey and Long Island. From there, they start showing up in Rhode Island waters. By the end of the summer, there may be mako sharks that are up off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. At the end of the summer and even later into the fall, most of them head south to that cycle again."
   
 As the trip continues, a pod of half a dozen Atlantic white-sided dolphins performs seemingly choreographed dives through the waves. "For some people, that sight alone would be worth the price of admission," Wetherbee says.
   
 "Makos are overfished. Everyone wants to go after them," he says. Tagging the sharks provides a plethora of information about their movements, such as which country's waters they will pass through.
   
 "Our indications are that some of ours have traveled through 27 different countries," he says. Each time the shark is near the surface, the transmitter signals the animal's location. Since the start of the program, Wetherbee's sharks have produced some 60,000 signals, which paints a picture of how the fish spend their time.
   
 He has partnered with the Guy Harvey Research Institute in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, for his tagging and tracking. The institute maintains a website that allows scientists and lay people alike to watch the movements of makos and other tagged animals. (Find the site at http://www.ghritracking.org/).
   
 The ocean is surprisingly calm this day, and after a short ride, Wetherbee arrives at what he only half-jokingly calls his "secret spot." With him are URI seniors Bailey Jenkins and Colby Kresge, who quickly prepare the fishing equipment once the boat stops. (All those aboard are masked against the coronavirus.)
   
 "This is part of what you can do if you come to URI," Wetherbee says. "If you're able to do things like this as an undergraduate, it's a pretty good deal."
   
 Jenkins says the tagging has made her realize that "sharks are just the most important animals." Kresge, a sport fisherman himself, says he's also working on a project involving photographing stingrays. "We get to do a lot of stuff, working with makos, blue sharks, and others," he says.
   
 "This is like caveman fishing," Wetherbee says. "We just throw on a hook and bait and fish. People think we're crazy. We're just a few miles from shore, not where we're 'supposed to be.' We're just using handlines."
   
 The team uses circle hooks, which are designed to hook the fish in the corners of their mouths for safe release. The hooks are baited and tied to a nylon rope with a heavy wire leader. Then they're tossed overboard, along with a float like those used in marking lobster traps. After that, it's hurry up and wait as the boat drifts with the waves.
   
 The trio take turns dunking a bucket of frozen chum (ground fish) in the water, creating a slick of oil and tiny pieces of fish. The chum is intended to create a widespread scent field that will attract sharks from the 120-foot water.
   
 Less than 30 minutes pass before the first strike.
   
 "There's a mako!" Jenkins calls as one of the floats begins to splash back and forth in the water. It's time to secure the lines and be sure they won't get tangled. A moment later, the shark comes off. "We got his attention anyway," Wetherbee says.
   
 Shortly after that, another shark takes the bait. The rope is grabbed and pulled up. At first, the animal feels heavy but not particularly active. A moment later, though, it appears to realize that it's been hooked. That's when it makes a break for it, the rope flying through the crew's gloved hands.
   
 At one point, they must release their grip on the rope to avoid injury. A moment later the fish seems to pause, and the process of pulling it to the surface resumes.
   
 This time the team is successful, and soon a 5-foot female mako is hauled onto the deck. Jenkins and Kresge quickly move to subdue the head and the tail while Wetherbee gathers his tagging gear.
   
 Makos have a distinctive bullet-shaped head and row after row of teeth, continually moving forward and replacing old ones. Their eyes are large and black, and the skin tones are white, silver, blue and black, well suited for hunting.
   
 They take a series of measurements, and Wetherbee quickly places the tag on the dorsal fin. The device, which may last several years, will send signals to a satellite which will allow Wetherbee to track its movements. The tracking he does will aid in state and federal decisions regarding fishing limits and other protections for the sharks. "Everyone would like to be able to fish for mako for years to come," Wetherbee says.
   
 In less than five minutes, the shark is back over the side. The ropes that held it in place are removed, and with one angry flick of its tail she fades into the darkness. The crew baits the hooks, throw the floats over the side, and the process begins again.

Owner Harry Graham said they were lucky that the facility also had a restaurant license. Funds have been tight, but they were able to stay open and serve takeout food when many breweries were shut down entirely.
 “It's been tough, but the restaurant business is very rarely anything easy,” Graham said. “During these days of very slow recovery, every cent represents a significant opportunity cost and potential to jeopardize necessary cash flow.”
 He said he doesn’t think the licensing fees would make or break his business, but noted that he can’t speak for every other brewer.
 Another affected business is Cafe DaVinci in DeLand. Owner Dan Reed said they were able to reopen because they share the same physical address as Neighbors Artisan Taqueria, a takeout restaurant, but that it isn’t a sustainable business model.
 “We need to be a bar and do bar things,” he said. “We will continue to do what we can until that day.”
 Willacker had hoped the state would provide an extension or discount for licensing fees, considering the restrictions put in place on businesses like hers.
 Still, she said she was frustrated with the state’s crackdown on bars, when restaurants have been allowed to operate with restrictions in place.
 “The way the regulations stand right now, the state views sitting at a table with a beer and burger in front of me safer than me sitting at a table with only a beer sitting in front of me,” Willacker said. “From the hostess, to the server, to the kitchen staff, to the busser, I come in close contact with more people in a restaurant than I do going to a bar, ordering a beer, and having a seat. Bars and breweries can follow the same occupancy, social distancing and mask mandates that restaurants can.”

When former Gov. Joan Finney -- the first female governor of Kansas -- was campaigning for state office, there was always one person who was by her side.
   
 "He was easily her best campaign staffer. He drove her everywhere around the state of Kansas," said Larry Tenopir, an attorney who knew the Finneys for many years through political events.
   
 Her husband would just quietly wait in the background while Joan would be the center of attention in the many political events she held, Tenopir observed.
   
 "He's about as supportive as a spouse I have ever seen, and he did everything to support her and advance her ambitions in politics," he said.
   
 Spencer W. Finney, the first first gentleman of Kansas, died Thursday in Topeka of natural causes. He was 89, said his daughter Mary Holladay.
   
 Born January 20, 1931, in Chanute, Kansas, Finney lived in Topeka for most of his life. He was a 1994 graduate of Topeka High School and attended Washburn University. Afterward, he worked for a railroad company.
   
 Spencer and Joan Finney met each other through politics, their daughter said. Around 1952, Joan was serving then-Sen. Frank Carlson in Washington, D.C. She flew back to Topeka to open up an office for Carlson and would meet with Spencer's father -- involved with the state GOP -- to talk politics.
   
 The two married in 1957 and stayed together for 44 years until Joan's death.
   
 During his stint as first gentlemen, Spencer took his role with stride. He would host the many events a first lady would host at the governor's mansion, such as Easter Egg Hunts and fishing events, said Holladay.
   
 "I've heard various ladies' organizations would go out for teas and chores and whatever and he just fit into that seamlessly," said Tenopir. "He was just his pleasant, normal, welcoming self, and they all accepted him and spent a lot of time with him."
   
 He was a steady and stabilizing force for his wife as she ran statewide campaigns, Holladay said.
   
 Both Holladay and Tenopir noted the pioneering role he took on as first gentlemen in a day and age where women often took a secondary role.
   
 "He played a supportive role and was happy to accompany her. It worked well, as she was in a time period where women were struggling to break through," Holladay said.
   
 Along with Holladay, Finney is survived by children Sarah "Sally" Finney Timm and Richard Finney, six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

Joe Hiatt   Joe S. Hiatt, 90, of Charleston died Aug. 31, 2020, at his residence. He was born April 2, 1930, in Charleston to H. Clyde and Eula Y. Hiatt.   Joe graduated from Charleston High School in 1948 before attending Fort Smith Junior College and Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Later in his career, he completed degrees from Southwestern Graduate School of Banking at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., where he studied senior bank management.   In 1952, he wed Margie L. Moore, who would be his wife until her death in 2015. Joe began his career in banking at First National Bank of Fort Smith in 1954. A few years later, in 1957, they started their family. He decided to leave First National Bank and join his family's business, American State Bank of Charleston, where Margie had been employed for several years. They became partners in business as well as marriage. During their careers, they continued to invest in the business and eventually became majority shareholders of American Bancshares of Arkansas.   Over the next 40 years, Joe would serve as cashier, vice president, president and chairman of the bank. Concurrently, in the 1970s, he was a director and co-owner of First National Bank of Paris. During this time, he was a strong advocate of responsible, conservative banking practices. In 1967, Gov. Rockefeller appointed him to the State Bank Law Study Commission, which was responsible for the recodification of state banking laws through Act 179 of 1969. An active member of the Arkansas Bankers Association and American Bankers Association, he served on numerous committees and promoted the principles he believed to be in the best interest of the banking industry. He was instrumental in the creation of the Arkansas Bankers Bank, a cooperative which enabled community banks to operate more efficiently, and served as a founding director and the first chairman. In 1999, American State Bank was acquired by Simmons First National Bank of Pine Bluff, where he would serve as director and director emeritus until 2015.   In addition to a full professional life, Joe was committed to contributing through public service and civic involvement. After serving two years in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he served 14 years in the Army Reserve and Arkansas National Guard. He was especially proud to have been called to active duty during the Little Rock Central High School integration crisis in 1957. Other public service contributions include mayor of the City of Charleston, chairman of the Charleston Centennial Committee, chairman of the South Franklin County Fair, president of the Charleston Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the Franklin-Logan County Economic Development Corporation, and a member of Sparks Regional Medical Center Advisory Board. He was a lifelong member and faithful supporter of First United Methodist Church in Charleston.   Never one to be idle, he enjoyed many pastime activities including fishing, hunting, golf and travel. He also officiated high school football for over 20 years. However, snow skiing, which he first attempted at age 54, became a passion. Continuing to ski for over 20 years, he never tired of watching his grandchildren and other novices experience the sport for the first time.   After retiring from banking, Joe renewed his interest in cattle ranching. He was actively involved in the daily management of the ranch until an accident in 2014 limited his ability to do so. However, his interest in the ranch never waned. He continued to monitor the herd, hay and feed requirements, and methods and equipment which would better the operation.   Although their business and personal lives focused greatly on Charleston, Joe and Margie wanted their children and grandchildren to explore new things which would enrich their lives. Joe was adamant that they would benefit greatly from experiencing the Smithsonian Institute or World's Fair Exposition, observing a session of Congress or the Senate, witnessing the launching of a nuclear battleship, visiting noteworthy sites in America or abroad, or embracing and appreciating new people, places and cultures.   In addition to his parents and wife, he was preceded in death by three brothers, Paul Hiatt, Bill Hiatt and Clyde L. Hiatt; and a sister, Lucille H. Phillips.   He is survived by his children, J. Sherman Hiatt II and Misty D. Hiatt, both of Charleston, and J. Clay Hiatt of Fort Smith; his grandchildren, April L. Newhart, Wendy M. Lovett and husband Shawn and Katherine O. Gage; his great- grandchildren, Alexis Grandison, Addison Newhart, Avery Lovett, Mason Newhart and Anna Kate Lovett, all of Charleston. He is also survived by a brother, Don Y. Hiatt and wife Rebecca of Charleston; his sisters-in-law, Venoma Hiatt Newhart of Memphis, Tenn., and Loretta B. Hiatt of Fayetteville; and many nieces and nephews.   His family wishes to gratefully acknowledge his caregivers, Kathy Sampley and JoAnn Neissl Woods, for their many years of compassionate and devoted care.   A celebration of his life will be held at a later date. Cremation is under the direction of Brotherton Brothers Funeral Home with a family inurnment at First United Methodist Church in Charleston.   Memorials may be made to Joe S. Hiatt Memorial Fund c/o Arkansas Community Foundation, Union Station, 1400 W. Markham St., Suite 206, Little Rock, AR 72201; or the charity of one's choice.

“Part of this cost – but not all – is the NBN CVC charge. Even with NBN’s extra CVC COVID offer, we are either at cost or losing money on those plans.”
 Both Aussie Broadband and Telstra believe the CVC structure needs to be abolished altogether.
 “Even if NBN extends its COVID CVC offer, this is only a band-aid solution to a deeper problem,” Phillip Britt said in an email to Gizmodo Australia.
 “We need to scrap CVC altogether and move to a single access charge based on the speed tier chosen, with no usage or CVC component. This is how other countries, such as New Zealand, operate. CVC is something that appears to be unique to the Australian market.”
 “Given a lot of people will be continuing to work and study from home for the foreseeable future, we think it makes sense to extend the 40 per cent free allocation of CVCs for the locked down geographies for the time being,” a Telstra spokesperson said to Gizmodo Australia over email.
 Only time will tell if NBN Co will need to extend the 40 per cent extra CVC offer yet again.

Estevan Montoya, 17, accused of fatally shooting former Santa Fe High School basketball player Fedonta "JB" White at a party last month in Santa Fe County, will remain in custody pending trial.
 State District Judge T. Glenn Ellington ruled Thursday that Montoya could pose a threat to the public and also could be in danger himself if he were released.
 "Because of his affiliation, because of the notoriety of the case, but more importantly to the community as a whole, the court finds that there are no conditions of release that would ensure the safety of the community," Ellington said.
 Montoya, through his attorney, Dan Marlowe, pleaded not guilty to the charge of first-degree murder, among other counts.
 Montoya appeared by video conference from the San Juan County juvenile detention facility in Farmington and told Ellington he understood the charges filed against him and his rights.
 Prosecutor David Shapiro laid out the case for keeping Montoya in custody pending trial, citing everything from Montoya's school disciplinary records to a cellphone video he says shows Montoya holding and shooting a gun at a Santa Fe park earlier this year.
 Shapiro also said there were reports that Montoya threatened fellow students at Capital High School with a gun. He referred to a Jan. 29 Santa Fe Police Department report several times during the hearing.
 According to the report, a fellow student told police he witnessed a fight involving Montoya on Jan. 27 at SWAN Park.
 The unidentified student told police both his cousin and Montoya fired guns during the incident, the police report said.
 Marlowe said the person appearing in the cellphone videos of the fight is not Montoya and there is no proof it is him.
 Ellington took a brief recess during Thursday's hearing to review the video and later ruled it did appear to be Montoya.
 The same student told police Montoya sent him a picture of a gun on Jan. 28, "saying something along the lines of you better watch your back," the police report said.
 The student also said Montoya threatened him with a gun on Jan. 29 at the high school, the report said, but his retelling of the incident "was very inconsistent."
 The student later changed his story and said Montoya only made threats on Jan. 28 through Snapchat, the report said.
 Based on the information from students, officers searched Montoya's backpack for weapons and discovered a bag containing 57 grams of marijuana, the police report said. Officers never found a firearm in Montoya's backpack or at his home, but they did find a BB gun.
 Montoya was later charged with one count of distribution of a controlled substance, according to a petition filed in District Court in February.
 The police department stopped its investigation into the shooting at SWAN Park after the witness became uncooperative, city of Santa Fe spokeswoman Kristine Mihelcic has said.
 Shapiro also said Montoya is a member of a local gang — the Southside Goons. He characterized Montoya as a "proud gang member," referring to photos posted on social media in which the teen holds various firearms, magazines and cash and flashes what Shapiro referred to as gang signs.
 Several students told police it was common knowledge Montoya carried a gun and dealt drugs, Shapiro said.
 Marlowe argued this is the first time Montoya has been charged with a violent offense and should be placed on GPS monitoring and house arrest under the third-party custody of his grandmother — with whom he was living at the time of the shooting.
 "It is also pretty common knowledge that people jump to conclusions, you know, some girl at the party saying everyone knows Estevan carries a gun," Marlowe said. "Everyone doesn't know that."
 Shapiro also referred to a total of 38 incidents on Montoya's school record dating back to at least 2012 and said 11 of these were instances of violence.
 While Marlowe argued Montoya only had two prior delinquent acts in his criminal history, Shapiro said the motion for his pretrial detention was based on his history and character, not just his criminal record.

Pauline Frazier of Houma, La., celebrated her 107th birthday on Tuesday.
   
 "This is such a great achievement," said Frazier's daughter, Kathy Marion, who traveled to Houma from Florida to help her mom celebrate her big day. "So far she's gotten over 240 birthday cards. She is an amazing woman."
   
 Frazier, originally from West Virginia, was born Sept. 1, 1913. Woodrow Wilson was president, World War I would break out the following year, and 15 years later Huey Long took over as Louisiana's governor.
   
 As grew up, she helped her mother clean a one-room schoolhouse and studied to be a missionary. However, those studies were put on hold when she met and married Hugh Hebb on May 16, 1936. Today, many people know her as "Granny."
   
 She had 12 children, seven of whom were born in West Virginia. Frazier has called several other places home, including, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. However, she has lived in Houma for the past 40 years. Her husband died in 1966.
   
 "She raised 12 children and always had a house full of grandchildren and neighbors' kids," Marion said. "To make ends meet, she would babysit. One never knew how many children would be at her home. She always had an open lap. She's proud of her six sons and two sons-in-law who served in the military."
   
 Two of her sons served in the Vietnam War. Nine of her children were born at home and her family is spread out from coast to coast.
   
 Frazier saw a lot changes over the decades. She saw her first airplane flying overhead while she played in her yard when she was 4 years old. Manned flight had started just 14 years earlier.
   
 "The first time she saw an airplane it scared her," Marion said. "She didn't know what it was. Her stories are unimaginable to us. My older sister was just a little over a pound when she was born. They kept her in a man's boot box on top of a coal-burning stove. She used a man's handkerchief as a diaper."
   
 It's not clear what Frazier's secret is to a long life, but Marion suspects it could be a combination of several factors.
   
 "I really don't know," she said. "I ask her that all the time. She never drank. She never smoked. She walked everywhere because she never had a driver's license. One of her sisters was over 100 and another was 99, so her family has good genes. But I think her sense of humor is just phenomenal. She's always been a kidder and a jokester. At 107 she is still in good health and great spirits."
   
 At 92, Frazier was the oldest person to ride in a Houma Mardi Gras float, Marion said. She also helped deliver newspapers at the age of 93, becoming a fixture on local paper routes.
   
 She is one of the few people alive today who has experienced two global pandemics. Frazier shared stories of the flu pandemic of 1918, Marion said.
   
 "She said her father was downstairs with the boys who were sick downstairs," Marion said. "The girls were upstairs. Back then they didn't have the penicillin we have now. There was one person who took care of everybody. It's amazing to hear these stories from her."
   
 Marion said her mom loves to travel, make quilts, put together jigsaw puzzles and walk.
   
 "I didn't do a whole lot," Frazier said when asked how it felt to turn 107. "I try to make people happy."
   
 Marion said her mom has gone above and beyond that.
   
 "She's just open, fun and charismatic," Marion said. "She's been a great mom. That's what her life is all about."

Cormac Sampson has moved from tight end to O-line, back to tight end and now back to O-line in two years with the Wisconsin Badgers.
 The former Eau Claire Memorial Old Abe has certainly proven he’s adaptable. And that’s a useful trait to possess right now, when the next step for many football players like him across the country remains up in the air.
 “I’ve been taking it day-by-day, which is the approach that all the players have been taking just because we don’t know what the future’s going to bring in this uncertain time,” Sampson said.
 The Big Ten, along with fellow Power Five conference the Pac-12, announced the cancellation of the fall football season on Aug. 11. The league stated in a brief released earlier this week the decision was made after an 11-3 vote by Big Ten presidents and chancellors.
 Suddenly, Chippewa Valley alumni Sampson and Mason Stokke, a Menomonie grad, face a fall without football.
 “It’s definitely going to be weird without as much practice or games,” said Stokke, the Badgers’ starting fullback. “And probably watching football on TV too, which is going to be probably the weirdest part about it.”
 Seven days at the start of August brought a rollercoaster of emotions for Big Ten players, who were first encouraged when the conference released a revised league-only schedule on Aug. 5. Six days later, Wisconsin head coach Paul Chryst told his team the fall season had been canceled over Zoom.
 “With those rumors kind of circulating, somehow the press got a hold of it, saying the Big Ten canceled before it had officially said something,” Sampson said. “We knew something was up, but once the news broke to us, it was just a heavy sinking feeling.”
 “It was just devastation,” Stokke added. “But I guess, what can you do?”
 So what’s next? The idea of playing in the spring has been discussed since the announcement was initially made, though there has been some trepidation about players being able to play a spring slate, take a few months off and then go right into the next fall season.
 Playing in the winter in multiple domed stadiums has also been discussed, as first reported by the Columbus Dispatch. Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez told ESPN last week the league would prefer a winter schedule to one in the spring.
 And after an initial feeling of finality to the Big Ten’s decision, there’s also been reporting done pointing toward a potential fall revival after pushback from players, coaches, administrators and parents, as well as a conversation between Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren and President Donald Trump.
 Among the options the league is considering is a Thanksgiving start, as reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel’s Jeff Potrykus, which would give schools the opportunity to play 10 to 11 games.
 NBC's Dan Patrick said earlier this week a source told him a Big Ten schedule could start as early as Oct. 10 if the conference can pass updated safety measures and procedures. Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh told players an October start was possible before the Wolverines practiced on Wednesday.
 That all goes against an open letter Warren released on Aug. 19, which reiterated that the league has no plans to revisit the fall decision. Players are constantly dealing with updates pointing all sorts of directions.
 “You kind of hear it, get a little bit excited for it,” Stokke said, ‘but not try to look too much into it because there’s still so much uncertainty.”
 As a redshirt senior, Stokke is obviously following the latest happenings closely. While Sampson, entering his redshirt sophomore year, has years of college football ahead of him, this was supposed to be Stokke's last ride.
 Some Big Ten seniors have discussed skipping out on a potential spring season to prepare for the NFL draft, especially if the draft doesn't get pushed back from its current April 29-May 1, 2021 slot. That wouldn't be out of the question for Stokke, who ESPN NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. listed as the second best fullback in the 2021 class back in the spring. But for now, Stokke plans on sticking with the Badgers.
 “There’s definitely a little bit of questioning there,” Stokke said. “I want to play my senior year, so, if there’s football this year, I plan on playing it. Senior year is pretty special.”
 Stokke is coming off a season where he totaled 51 yards on the ground and 47 yards through the air in addition to his regular blocking duties. He also notched a pair of touchdowns while playing in 12 of Wisconsin's 14 games, including a memorable two-yard score against Oregon in the Rose Bowl.
 "I had a pretty good year," Stokke said. "I would have liked to stay healthy for those couple of games and there's definitely things I can improve on and could have been a lot better on. But yeah, I was happy with my junior year."
 Sampson played in 13 games for the Badgers last year, including two starts at tight end after injuries at the position moved him back to the end of the line in a blocking role. Now, he has to bulk up yet again.
 "I definitely have more of an understanding of how to put on that good weight," Sampson said. "I would say it's definitely easier to put on weight because you can still be eating the things you want to eat. When you're losing weight, you have to watch what you're eating. Now I'm up to 300 pounds, so I've taken what I learned when I went from O-line my freshman spring to now. I think it's really helped out a bunch."
 School started on Wednesday for Stokke and Sampson down in Madison, and the Badgers are allowed to practice this fall in a limited capacity. When they'll be back competing against other schools is anyone's guess.
 “I do think we’ll play football at some point this year,” Stokke said.
