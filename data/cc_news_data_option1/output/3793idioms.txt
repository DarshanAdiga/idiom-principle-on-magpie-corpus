Delta Air Lines has now banned about 350 passengers for refusing to wear masks on board planes, CEO Ed Bastian said on Tuesday.          "For political reasons, or other reasons, they insisted on not wearing a mask after being asked multiple times to put it back on," Bastian said, speaking at the Skift Global Forum. "So they're not going to fly Delta. They're not going to have the privilege."          Delta and other US airlines began requiring passengers and crewmembers to wear masks on flights in May. However, flight crews initially had little ability or direction on enforcing the requirements. In June, most US airlines, including Delta, said they would begin banning passengers who refused to cooperate.          "While that was a little choppy in getting going, because you don't want your flight attendants to turn into a police, having to monitor compliance, customers appreciate it," Bastian said.

With over $2.35 billion having been raised for community preservation funding in the past 20 years, some municipalities that have lost out by not having adopted the Community Preservation Act now want a piece of the pie.          Community Preservation Act, signed into law in 2000 by the late Gov. Paul Cellucci, provides state matching money to communities that have levied property tax surcharges up to 3% for funding of open space protection and outdoor recreation, historic preservation, and affordable housing. Over 12,000 projects have been approved locally.          To date, 177 cities and towns in the state have adopted CPA. Only about a dozen are in Worcester County, a much larger number is in Middlesex County. Nine municipalities have CPA on the Nov. 3 ballot, including Shrewsbury, Hopedale, Lancaster, Franklin, and Framingham.          Chase Mack, communications director for the Community Preservation Coalition, said, with the pandemic, it's been a tough year for campaigning to get communities to adopt CPA.          "I'm still impressed that nine communities still prioritized it with everything going on," Mack said. "Everyone who has adopted CPA doesn't want to give it up. It's been very successful."          Shrewsbury's recent annual Town Meeting approved a citizen petition warrant article to put the initiative before a town-wide vote in November. The Board of Selectmen did not support the initiative because the board is pushing for a ballot question for a debt exclusion to build a new police station and an upgraded town-wide emergency communication system. A special town meeting on Sept. 29 will decide whether that project will be on the ballot.          "It's not that we're not supporting the CPA. We're not supporting the CPA at this time," Selectmen Chair Beth N. Casavant, explained. "CPA could go before voters anytime. It doesn't have to be voted on in November."          A feasibility study funded by a $250,000 appropriation approved by the 2019 annual town meeting and a $50,000 state grant is near complete. The next step is voter approval of the project.          Casavant said the town has known about the need to replace the police station for 15 years, but it kept getting pushed back. Other projects, including some schools and the library took priority because - unlike the police station - they were all eligible for significant state grants.          "We believe it is critical to continue moving forward with this project now. We've come to the point that, if we don't do something as a community to address the aging police station, we're going to find ourselves making short-term repairs that aren't in the best financial interest of the taxpayer."          Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to MetroWestDailyNews.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.          Members of Community Preservation Shrewsbury said the town is missing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars each year that could go toward quality-of-life projects that the town usually does not have in its budget. Plans began two years ago to get CPA on the 2020 presidential ballot because it brings more voters out.          They point out that even though the town does not have CPA, it is paying into the state CPA trust fund that is being dispersed to CPA municipalities. The fund gets revenue from recording fees at the Registries of Deeds. The fee was increased in December for most documents filed from $20 to $50; and from $10 to $25 for municipal lien certificates. Last year the Legislature added $20 million to the trust fund. Magee said if Shrewsbury had CPA, it would have gotten more than $100,000 from the state trust fund in 2019.          "Our feeling is one (proposal) does not rule out the other. People can vote for two things at once. There will never be a year that we are not building something in Shrewsbury," said Melanie Magee, a committee member, who pointed out that she will also be voting for the police station debt exclusion. "CPA involves a very small amount of money from the taxpayer."          A local property tax surcharge of 1% would mean that the average Shrewsbury single-family homeowner would pay $47.21 a year or $11.80 on a quarterly tax bill based on the current tax rate. There are several exemptions, including the first $100,000 of the property assessed value.          That would generate about $600,000 annually. In addition, Shrewsbury would receive an annual variable match from the state fund. Last year's state match of 23.9% would have generated the town more than $100,000 from the state.          Magee said towns that already have CPA are doing great things with it.          "When you go to a town with CPA, the difference is amazing," she said. "My grandchildren live in Medway and they have beautiful playgrounds. Ours have been managed sufficiently. They're clean and neat. But, there's maybe a 20-year-old set of swings and a basketball court and there are no benches or trees."          Framingham 'really has lost out'          Framingham also tried to adopt CPA in 2001. Proponents went for the highest allowable surcharge of 3% and the measure was defeated. At the recommendation of a study group, the City Council voted unanimously in July to referendum on the ballot. The surcharge this time around is 1%. Most residential property owners will pay less than $50 a year. That would generate the city of 70,000 just over $1.5 million annually plus at least $300,000 from the state.          Steve Weisman, chairman of Framingham Community Preservation Now, said over the past 20 years, there were a number of opportunities to protect open space, preserve historic buildings and create outdoor recreation facilities, but there wasn't available local funding. With potential loss of revenue due to the pandemic, it is more important now than ever to take advantage of the funding source for the quality of life projects.          "Those are all things speaking to why this is such a good investment and a good time to do it," Weisman said. "Framingham really has lost out on a significant state match that was available, which would have provided a terrific return on investment from surcharges from residents."          'Absolutely necessary in Hopedale'          Hopedale property owners would also pay less than $50 a year, if they accept CPA at the November election. Voters, however, turned down a $1.3 million Proposition 2 ½ operational override Wednesday. A $430,000 override was successful last year.          Town Administrator Diana Schindler on Thursday said the town will have to hold a special town meeting to balance the budget. Nevertheless, she is hopeful that the CPA ballot question will still pass.          "The towns around us have been in CPA for some time. We're kind of late to the party," Schindler said. "It's absolutely necessary in Hopedale. The things it funds are things we need to look at: historic preservation, open space, and we're going to have to look at housing in the coming years."          The first few years of CPA, municipalities received a 100% match from the state trust fund because there were fewer communities that had adopted it. Over the years as more communities have come on board, and depending on collections at the Registries of Deeds, the state match figure has declined.          Currently, the match that goes out to communities in November, is projected to be higher than last year's. The Community Preservation Coalition said despite the pandemic, filings at the Registries each month have averaged out to be approximately 2.5 times higher than in 2019. The projected base match will be between 25% and 30% of what municipalities raise at the local level.          "Since we haven't seen the CPA collections for the trust fund dip at all, we suspect it's because the real estate market hasn't seen a real dip by the pandemic, Mack, the coalition's communications director, said.          Marlborough man considered the father of CPA          Robert A. Durand of Marlborough, a former legislator who later served as secretary of environmental affairs, is considered the "father" of CPA.          In 1984, he initially advocated for an open-space land bank as developers were converting vast farmland into housing developments and sprawling shopping centers. In 1988, affordable housing was added because young people were being priced out of homes in communities where they grew up in.          In 1997, the historic preservation component was added and Durand filed the first legislation entitled Community Preservation Act. But, it was not until when Durand served as Secretary of Environmental Affairs that he was able to garner the necessary support from the Legislature for approval of CPA. It was signed into law by his longtime friend, Gov. Cellucci, in September, 2000.          Durand, a representative of the Community Preservation Coalition and president of Durand & Anastas Environmental Strategies, said he is "overjoyed" by what has been accomplished with CPA. The father of six said he calls CPA his "other kid."          "Particularly with Proposition 2 1/2, money has always gone to education, public safety, roads and transportation, as it should. Historic resources, housing opportunities and ball fields have always taken second placed to those issues," Durand said. "This allows communities to have funding to protect their quality of life and chart their own destiny."

Oil futures finished higher on Tuesday ahead of data that are expected to show a second straight weekly decline in U.S. crude supplies. On average, analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday to report a fall of 4 million barrels in domestic crude inventories for the week ended Sept. 18. Oil's climb Tuesday was modest however, as energy traders struggled "to assess the uncertainty with U.S. production as we approach the last two months of hurricane season [and] how bad the demand outlook will get following the winter wave of the coronavirus," as Libyan oil production slowly bounces back, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. October West Texas Intermediate oil , which expired at the end of the day's session, rose 29 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $39.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The state Senate passed the bill in June.          Lawmakers cited a "catastrophic and unprecedented economic contraction," to Atlantic City and the surrounding area as result of the 107-day shut down of the casinos, which resulted in more than $112 million in operating losses for the gambling parlors and a nearly 50% reduction of the industry's workforce.

The park site consists of Rotary Pavilion the property previously used as a bank drive-through.
 During the discussion, councilwoman Nancy Goodloe suggested the park name might be tied into plans to recognize the inclusion and diversity various council sub-committees are currently researching.
 “There has been some good points made tonight despite a difference of opinion,” she said. “I appreciate the commission’s deliberations on their survey. In light of some of the things we’re hearing in our inclusion, diversity and equity discussions, it strikes me that we might have an opportunity to think bigger about the park’s name.
 “We have talked about possibly using monuments and plaques that different people that have made in their contributions to Ellensburg. I would like to see something that would reflect something along those lines. The name that was mentioned to me was something like Heritage Park.”
 Councilwoman Stacey Engel said times are significantly different than when the parks commission was tasked with sorting through the park names that included some 70 suggestions back in February.
 “Our lives looked a lot different in February when the questionnaire was distributed than it does now. There has been a lot of changes to our community and our country,” she said. “I think if we do the survey again, we’ll get a totally different response.”
 The council did agree that there is no specific timeline to naming the park and that further discussions can take advantage of a moment in Ellensburg history for a community that has always pulled together during difficult times.
 “We don’t get a lot of opportunities to name parks every day,” Councilwoman Tristen Lamb said. “I feel bad for Brad (Case) and his staff for putting in a lot of time and a lot of work.

If you live here, you need to be counted.          Unfortunately, many of us aren’t. Certain communities — such as rural, Black, Indigenous, Latinx, immigrant, and LGBTQ folks — are especially likely to be undercounted. Some experts warn this year’s census could be the worst undercount of Black and Latinx people in 30 years.          When communities are undercounted, they’re drained of their political representation and their resources. We can’t let that happen.          The more people your state counts, the more seats it gets in Congress. That gives your state — and you — a bigger say in making laws and selecting the president through the Electoral College. If you don’t get counted, you get less say.          The census also determines how the federal government spends about $1.5 trillion every year on programs like food stamps, unemployment, housing assistance, education, infrastructure projects, and Medicare and Medicaid.          During a pandemic and recession, states need every last dime to support these programs. If you’re uncounted, your state gets shortchanged — which could be especially devastating during a pandemic and recession.          Unfortunately, 13 out of the 15 poorest states have a lower response rate now compared to the previous census count in 2010. That means the most vulnerable communities, including those hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, are at risk of losing out on crucial support for recovery efforts.          There are poor counties in Mississippi and Louisiana, for example, where census response rates are as low as 30 percent. In West Virginia, response rates in some counties are hovering at around 23 percent. And in one poor New Mexico county, the response rate is just 18 percent.          Rates are even lower on many tribal lands. At the Jicarilla Apache reservation in New Mexico and the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in Montana, they’re under 15 percent. At the Gila River and Fort Apache reservations in Arizona, and the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota, they’re in the single digits.          An undercount won’t just harm these communities this year or next, but for a full decade into the future.          Please encourage anyone and everyone you know to take the census, especially if you are from a marginalized community. Taking the census will ensure you, your loved ones, and your neighbors get their fair share of federal funding — and representation in our democracy.          You matter. Your presence here matters. As peculiar as it may sound, you could save your life and livelihood, or your neighbor’s, just by filling out your census form.

The issues are many and varied - health, education, fisheries and agriculture, employment, economy, roads, mining, road and rail transport, and allied sectors of the economy.               The NPP, which panders to the capitalist ideology, and the NDC, which pursues social democratic policies, have sent clear messages to Ghanaians with regard to what they hope to achieve for them and the nation.               The campaign themes of the NPP are focused on development in freedom, One District, One Factory; One District, One Dam; One Constituency, One million dollars, free SHS, and job creation with its youth-based Nation Builders Corps (NABCO), and National Health Insurance Scheme. The NPP has also banned galamsey operations and introduced community mining with a view to protecting the environment, prioritized construction of roads and interchanges, restored training teachers and nurses’ allowances, among others.               The NDC lays claim to numerous infrastructure projects spanning education, health, roads, construction of interchanges and promises to enhance the free education with a progressively free version, and restoration of the ‘Okada’ form of transportation it banned before exiting governance.               The NDC has outlined in its manifesto development projects it intends to undertake when voted back into power. It intends again to “absorb 50 per cent of fees of tertiary students for the 2020/2021 academic year to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on students and parents”.

O'Neill was on board a flight on Wednesday, August 19, when he tweeted a selfie with the caption "I'm not a p----." Unlike a fellow passenger in a US Marine Corps hat and a flight attendant visible in the photo, O'Neill was not wearing a mask. The airline banned O'Neill the following day.          Delta recently strengthened its mask policy, requiring anyone claiming a medical exemption to consult with an airline-contracted telehealth medical professional before boarding.          "Any false claims of a disability or health condition to obtain an exemption from wearing a mask or face covering may result in the suspension of travel privileges on any Delta flight for the duration of the mask/face covering requirement," the airline said.          A review from Harvard's TH Chan School of Public Health found that the proper use of face masks on airplanes, combined with other measures, substantially lowers the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 virus being transmitted during a flight.

Still in the works and expected to be done by April of next year is a new palm tree-lined entryway that will mark a return to its original location where hotel guests in the early years would arrive by train. In another nod to the hotel’s historical roots, the original veranda that ran across the front facade, from the ballroom to the Crown Room, will be recreated as the hotel’s new “front porch.” Also targeted for an April completion is a remodel of the hotel’s lobby.          In addition, three of the property’s historic structures — the Ice House, Laundry Building and Power Plant — are being restored and repurposed.           The Ice House, built in 1889, is being transformed into a museum to showcase all the hotel’s historic images curated over the years and will be completed later this year. The restoration of the Laundry Building is complete, and the hotel is currently weighing possible uses for it, including event space or possibly a brewery, Rapoza said. And the Power Plant restoration, completed a couple of months ago, now has meeting space on the second level and on the first level houses the hotel’s engineering department.

What separates full-spectrum from other hemp products is the amount of cannabinoids they contain. You’ve probably heard this word before (you did click on this article, after all), but here’s a quick refresher: Cannabinoids are compounds found in the Cannabis plant that interact with your body to impact primary functions like pain, stress, appetite, and energy metabolism.           CBD “isolate” products contain a single cannabinoid (CBD), while a full-spectrum hemp product contains the full spectrum of the plant's cannabinoids—including CBD—as well as other beneficial compounds like terpenes and flavonoids. This is why “hemp oil” and “CBD” are not always the same thing, and why the difference matters.

The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing.                     We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time; and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day.                     And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now.                     So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply.                     And once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament.                     After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own.

Dallas, Texas, Sept.  22, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Seven weeks after city leadership forced the closure of their major event, YAL has filed suit against the City of Dallas, the Dallas Convention Center Hotel Development Corporation, and Omni Hotels Management Corporation                                    For months, YAL had coordinated with city officials and the Omni Dallas Hotel to launch its premier event, Mobilize 2020, from August 6-8. Altogether, travel plans had been finalized for 1,400 student activists, 250 investors, and 100 legislators to gather at the hotel, having taken every public health precaution the city demanded and approved just a week earlier.                                    Despite YAL going to incredible lengths to accommodate the city’s public health requests, the City of Dallas and public health officials forced the hotel to cancel the event three days before its start, costing YAL nearly $200,000 in damages.                                    “What we are fighting against in this lawsuit is exactly the kind of underhanded, double-dealing politics the American people are sick of,” said YAL President Cliff Maloney. “The city of Dallas needs to be asked: Why are unmasked protests being allowed to occur, but peaceful YAL events are being shut down? We look forward to seeing what discovery in this case reveals about what really went on here and how decisions were made behind closed doors to shut down a perfectly safe and peaceful event.”                                    Maloney is available to speak with accredited media personnel.

This type of fraud has to be perpetrated on real humans; it’s useless to stuff cookies in bots’ browsers because bots don’t typically buy stuff online. Real humans buy stuff, and the fraudsters want to get a commission for those purchases “by hook or by crook.” To increase their chances of earning those affiliate commissions, often the criminals load many urls of many affiliate programs in pop-unders, hidden browser windows, or invisible iframes on the page. Once the url loads, the cookies are stuffed into the browser, without the users’ knowledge or consent. The #FouAnalytics chart below shows what a cookie stuffing attack looks like in the data. One webpage is loaded in a browser, and then about 60 additional domains are loaded in hidden iframes — note all the consumer-facing domains like macys, hilton, marriott, hotels.com, etc. that were loaded. All of these urls contained affiliateIDs of the fraudster, so they could get paid an affiliate commission later. By loading so many urls at once, they increase their chances that the human would eventually buy from one or more of those merchants, which means the crook earns the commission.

San Diego County business owners surely breathed a collective sigh of relief Tuesday as the state’s latest COVID-19 reopening report showed the region in the red tier for another week.          Had the county’s collective case rate been over 7 cases per 100,000 residents, the COVID risk-ranking system would have automatically moved the home of the Padres to the more restrictive purple tier, reserved for locations where the novel coronavirus is thought to be spreading most quickly.          An average score of 6.8 cases per 100,000 residents and a positive test rate of 3.8 percent improved upon last week’s raw scores of 7.9 and 4.3 by enough to keep businesses, houses of worship and other organizations from having to move their operations back outdoors after only recently regaining the ability to resume fractional use of indoor spaces. San Diego’s score was adjusted up to 6.9 due to a coronavirus testing rate deemed to be lower than the statewide average.          The state ranking system requires a county to have out-of-bounds scores for two consecutive weeks in order to fall or rise from their current tier. This means that, even if San Diego County posted purple-worthy numbers again next week, it would take a similar result the following week to take a tumble.

The grown men are also horrified that their little sister is so rough around the edges -- no hat, no gloves, no worries about manners or decorum -- and decide that she must be sent to finishing school.

MAMARONECK, N.Y. (AP) — Mike Davis spent the last decade running the USGA, where he set up golf courses to provide an extreme test for elite players and searched for solutions to increasing distance. Now he wants to build golf courses, a lifelong passion. Davis announced Tuesday he will retire as CEO at the end of 2021, ending a 32-year career with the USGA that began with him overseeing ticket sales and transportation. He became the seventh executive director in 2011 and the USGA’s first CEO after an organizational shakeup in 2016. Davis, whose love of golf course architecture dates to when he was a junior golfer and would doodle holes on a piece of paper, said he will join Tom Fazio II in a new golf architecture firm called Fazio & Davis Golf Design. “One of the wonderful things these 32 years afforded me was I’ve gone out of my way to see most of the world’s great courses,” Davis said. “I’ve played them, studied them, read about them, taken pictures of them. I’ve read all the architecture books. I get as giddy with some architects as I do being around Jack, Arnold, Byron Nelson and Mickey Wright.” The announcement comes two days after Bryson DeChambeau crushed the notion that accuracy is tantamount to U.S. Open success. DeChambeau said he would hit driver as often as he could, even if it went into Winged Foot’s notorious rough, and he won by six shots by becoming the only player at par or better all four rounds of a U.S. Open at Winged Foot. The retirement, however, was in the works for several years. Davis had planned to announce it in September when the 2020 USGA championship season was over, so a successor could be found. Instead, the coronavirus pandemic forced the U.S. Open to be postponed from June until last week, with the U.S....

The other way would be to use her as a totally different character. Since Carrie Coon’s character required extensive CGI (you can hardly tell it’s her), it wouldn’t be out of the question if she made an appearance in the MCU as a totally different character. Who that character would be is anyone’s guess. But whatever ends up happening, let's hope Marvel brings Carrie Coon back to the table.

The EU relies on the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration to help execute its policies for dealing with people seeking sanctuary or better lives in Europe. Given the bitter divisions, much of the EU’s focus has been on preventing migrants from leaving North Africa or Turkey in the first place.          The two U.N. agencies underlined that “the current approach in the EU is unworkable, untenable and often carries devastating human consequences,” They are calling for “common EU action to take responsibility for search and rescue, and for disembarking people rescued at sea.”          Brussels is likely to use the fire that destroyed the overcrowded Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos on Sept. 9 as a “never again” moment. But aid groups had warned for years about the state of that camp, where more than 12,000 people lived in facilities meant for 3,000.          Other widely-criticized moves include the EU deal with Turkey, under which the EU paid billions of euros toward the protection of Syrian refugees there in exchange for Ankara stopping them from heading to Europe.

Desde ese momento, con el dolor a cuestas de perder a un hombre y militante excepcional, de esos imprescindibles de los que habla Bertolt Brecht, empezamos a diagramar un plan B. Y la idea era, en virtud del cerco que sufríamos, sacar provisoriamente la Agencia fuera del país y desde el exterior seguir informando. Así es que al tiempo, tanto Lucila como yo viajamos a Europa, y esperábamos a Lila que se nos uniría poco después. Lamentablemente, Lila fue apresada por los asesinos de la ESMA, y prácticamente allí se fueron al garete nuestras posibilidades de seguir con la Agencia. Yo seguí militando en la organización, en la revista internacional de la misma, y finalmente me desvinculé junto a un numeroso grupo de compañeros en 1979, cuando discrepamos sobre el regreso al país en el marco de la contraofensiva que planteó la conducción de la orga.

These things range from Amazon's Alexa and video doorbells to cloud computing and software to make sure they are secure.          Often I do this by replicating the actions of a malicious hacker in order to seek countermeasures to secure a system.

The new committee has only advisory authority, and members will not be paid.          At the same meeting, Joseph Trombetta was sworn in as a new Middle Township police officer. Officials cited Trombetta’s family history in law enforcement. His grandfather is a retired Middle Township officer and his father works with the Cape May County Sheriff’s Department.          Under continuing restrictions related to COVID-19, members of the public could not attend the Township Committee meeting on Monday, but the committee members gathered in the meeting room instead of attending virtually, in order to administer the oath of office to Trombetta in person.          It’s only the second time the committee has met in person since the state of emergency was declared for the pandemic, Donohue said.          “We feel it is necessary and proper to come here and put our suits on and make sure we do the right thing when we swear in our police officer,” Donohue said, adding that the governing body was honored to swear in Trombetta.          “We’re proud to have him,” he said.          Trombetta was joined by his mother, Christine Dahlen, who pinned his badge on him after he repeated the oath.          At the meeting, Leusner spoke of the connection Middle officers have to their community.          “One of the things that’s so special about Middle Township is that our officers grew up here. They’re invested here. They raise their families here,” he said. “And I know that you understand that.”          That commitment to community is important to the type of police work done in Middle Township, Leusner said.          Leusner said Trombetta’s grandfather helped him decide to become a police officer.

One look at the Tigers depth chart for this Saturday's game confirms Danielson's point. It is littered with former four and five-star recruits that have been waiting to step into the limelight. Now, they will get the chance to do just that. But, one interesting storyline to watch is how the offense reacts in games. As Danielson says, part of what made the Tigers combo of Brady and Emsinger so good last year was their ability to adjust on the fly to game situations, pointing to last year's Alabama game as an example.
