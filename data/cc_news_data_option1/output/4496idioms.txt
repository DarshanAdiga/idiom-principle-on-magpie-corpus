To deliver vaccination at the doorstep of every household, memoranda of understanding (MOUs) were signed between various state governments and international partners, thousands of volunteer mobilisers and vaccinators were engaged and trained, and vaccine logistics systems were overhauled in several states in the country. To improve acceptance of vaccination, religious and traditional leaders, particularly in the north, were brought on board. They in turn took ownership of the immunisation drive in their communities. Their support and involvement propelled the trust and confidence of their communities in the vaccination process. The result was improved vaccination of children across almost all communities in the country.

"Honestly, we think the Mountain America Center is a great project. It’ll be great for the community. We are excited to be a part of it," said Erik Hutchings, general manager of the PepsiCo location in Idaho Falls.
 The half-million-dollar donation is inching the project closer to its financial goal. Just before the pandemic struck, Spear had gotten a final guaranteed price from the general contractors: $57 million. The Auditorium District currently has $11 million in the bank for the event center. According to a financing plan made earlier this year, that puts the project approximately $2.5 million away from having the finances needed to begin construction.  
 Spear now plans to have the project rebid, hoping to lower that $57 million price.
 “We expect a more robust bidding cycle and more interest in the project. Even though there was significant interest before, we really think there’s going to be more opportunity to engage more subcontractors in the bidding process. Hopefully that results in better pricing for us,” Spear said
 Prior to the pandemic, things were looking good for the project that has been in the works for nearly 10 years. In February, Spear was “cautiously optimistic” on a March groundbreaking and a completion date of October 2021 if everything stayed on track financially.
 The coronavirus, however, has put a stop to such hopes. The Idaho Falls Auditorium District receives its main funding from a 5% room occupancy tax on all hotels, motels and other short-term rentals located within city limits. In 2019, the district received $2,407,599. When 2020 began, the room occupancy tax revenue was already exceeding the previous year’s numbers. Spear felt confident they would bring in that last $2.5 million needed to begin construction.

Nigeria waited with bated breath for the past four years when the last polio virus case was recorded in Borno state, North-east Nigeria. It was a long, hard fought battle that had been on for decades. Along the way, billions of dollars were spent by international partners and the Nigerian government.

2018 experiment in Ayres' lab offered proof of concept for that goal.

The team subsequently turned this observation into a treatment. In further experiments, they administered iron supplements to the mice and all the animals survived, even when the pathogen dose was upped a thousandfold.

While much of America was sleeping Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump’s leads in crucial battleground states began slipping — and that's when online falsehoods about the election started surging. More than 100,000 votes that Democratic nominee Joe Biden picked up in Wisconsin were evidence of “outright corruption,” one Twitter user surmised. The ballots were “MAGICALLY” found, claimed another. In fact, Biden's early morning comeback in the closely watched Midwestern state was simply the result of absentee and early votes being counted. With the outcome of the U.S. presidential race still in limbo, Trump and his supporters seized on — and spread — online misinformation about legally cast absentee and mail-in votes in battleground states. They used it as fodder to support the president’s baseless declaration on live television early Wednesday that Democrats were trying to “steal the election” from him. “They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!” Trump wrote in a tweet hours later. Trump’s campaign filed lawsuits Wednesday in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, paving the way for him to contest the election's outcome. It’s standard practice in the United States to continue counting votes after Election Day. Social media companies kept busy trying to counter the deluge of online misinformation, but experts say it is hard to completely blunt the impact. Researchers at the Election Integrity Partnership, a group of some of the world’s top misinformation researchers, found that mentions of voter fraud rose dramatically immediately following Trump’s early morning remarks. The unfounded allegations exploited public confusion over how elections are managed at a...

I wonder how some people can sleep at night! This is a time for some kind of national moral rearmament to save this country. This is the only country the black man has that possess a chance, all things being equal, to defend black humanity in an increasingly competitive and wicked world. Archbishop Justin Welby made this point also. But do our politicians realize that while we are still here on this side of the heavenly divide, we should help build a future where the labour of our heroes’ past will not be in vain? The foundation of that future must be laid on equity, justice, fairness, inclusion and political realism. There is no point burying our heads in the sand and saying all is well. All is not well. God will not come down from heaven to rule us. He has given us human intelligence and what we require is willpower to face our problems of population explosions, laziness, refusal to face the reality that in order to build a thriving future based on political stability, we have to rejig and restructure the governance architecture of this potentially great country which its temporary rulers have rendered largely unhappy. Those who make change impossible, as President John Fitzgerald Kennedy said, make revolution inevitable.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In an effort to address economic disparity laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic, San Francisco voters overwhelmingly approved several tax measures targeting property owners and big businesses with CEOs paid far higher than their average workers. Under the new law, any company whose top executive earns 100 times more than their average worker will pay an extra 0.1% surcharge on its annual business tax payment. If a CEO makes 200 times more than the average employee, the surcharge increases to 0.2%; 300 times gets a 0.3% surcharge and so on. Voters also agreed to sweeping business tax changes that will lead to a higher tax rate for many tech companies, and a higher transfer tax on property sales valued between $10 million and $25 million. “We’re not gonna shed any tears if penthouse dwellers have to cough up,” the San Francisco League of Pissed Off Voters wrote in its voter guide. The results “show that San Franciscans are concerned about growing economic inequality,” city Supervisor Matt Haney, the author of the measure titled the “Overpaid Executive Tax,'' said Wednesday. “The very wealthy are gaining more and more. They've gotten much richer during the pandemic, while everyone else has remained stagnant.” “We need the wealth that has been generated in the city to be shared more broadly with workers and residents,” he said. Critics call the surcharge a blatant attempt at redistribution of wealth and criticized raising business taxes in the middle of a recession. Since March, COVID-19 restrictions have shut down critical elements of San Francisco’s vibrant economy. Tourists are scarce, and legions of workers in tech and in the city's main business and financial districts have left, able to work remotely from anywhere....

Then, March hit. In March, hotel tax revenue fell by 29.87%. In March 2019, the Auditorium District received $137,349.48 in occupancy tax revenue. In March 2020, it received $96,322.39. April was the worst month for hotel revenue in 2020. The occupancy tax was down 74% from its April 2019 amount. However, each month since has been steadily improving. August is the most recent month for which data is available on local hotel tax numbers. In August, the Auditorium District received 72% of what it did in August 2019, meaning revenue was down just 28%.
 In total, the Auditorium District has received approximately $1.32 million from the room occupancy tax so far this year, from December 2019 through September 2020.
 “We’re trending in the right direction,” Spear said.
 The first two phases of the Mountain America Center, which would lay the groundwork for construction of the building, began prior to the pandemic: the construction work on Pioneer Road and the event center’s building pad. Both projects were completed in September.
 As for when construction will begin to bring the project vertical, Spear said there are too many unknown factors at this time to be able to make an estimate. In the meantime, he is focusing on gathering more donations.
 “The goal is to control what we can control. And what we can control is getting more contributions for this project until we recover from COVID eventually and get our tax revenue back up to normal,” Spear said.
 The Mountain American Center will be a 48,000-square-foot facility containing a 27,000-square-foot arena space. The arena is projected to hold 4,000 people. Spear said this seating will include 10 party suites that will have the capacity to seat between 13 to 24 people in each one. An additional 11,500 square feet will go toward meeting space.
 The auditorium district hopes to host events such as sporting events, rodeos, Disney on Ice, trade shows and conventions.
