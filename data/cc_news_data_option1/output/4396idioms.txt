CHARLOTTE, N.C. — If Kyle Larson had been a true free agent available to the highest bidder, Rick Hendrick doubts he would have entered the game.
 Hendrick had passed on Jeff Gordon’s advice years earlier to sign Larson out of sprint cars. It was Chip Ganassi who took the risk and spent the money to develop Larson into a NASCAR star. Hendrick recognized he’d whiffed, but didn’t want to outspend Ganassi to land the driver.
 “I think because of my relationship with Chip I couldn’t do it. I wouldn’t. I can’t,” Hendrick said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press. “If somebody is out there looking for a job, that’s one thing. But I do motors for Chip, we’re friends and, you know, I’d have a hard time with that.”
 There was no bidding war for Larson, who was fired by Ganassi in April for using a racial slur while competing in an online racing game. NASCAR suspended Larson and the driver spent the last six months educating himself on racial justice and understanding his error.
 Reinstated last week by NASCAR, Larson this week signed a multi-year contract with Hendrick Motorsports to drive the No. 5 Chevrolet next season. Hendrick has sold no sponsorship as of yet for Larson and only needed the blessing of Chevrolet, one of the partners that originally dropped Larson for using the n-word, to finalize the deal.
 Hendrick is willing to fund the No. 5 out of pocket for now, confident Larson is a better person from his experience. If Larson’s on-track performance meets Hendrick’s expectations, the team owner believes he can sell the sponsorship.
 “The plan is to let everybody get adjusted, let everybody see him and the performance I’m absolutely sure will be there,” Hendrick said. “As time goes on, they are going to see a story in him and I am a car salesman, you know?”
 Hendrick is indeed one of the largest car dealers in the United States as well as owner of one of NASCAR’s top organizations. His dueling businesses have been hit hard this year by the pandemic and Hendrick had to reorganize, renegotiate and readjust.
 Hendrick told AP he didn’t issue furloughs and paid employees 80% of their salaries. Contracts with sponsors were adjusted since NASCAR didn’t race at all for 10 weeks, and even after the season resumed, sponsors have not been permitted at the track to hold hospitalities or entertain customers.
 “I took a whack in April and a little bit of May, but we’ve come back and put together a really good year,” Hendrick said. “But living through that uncertainty, and the race teams, not knowing if you are going to have races and sponsors not being able to go to the track. It’s been one of the toughest years I’ve ever had trying to juggle everything.”
 He’s also had to be cautious with his own health. Hendrick is 71, battled chronic myelogenous leukemia two decades ago and is, in his own words, “overweight. I start each day on a diet and by 10 o’clock I want a cheeseburger and ice cream. I go to Dairy Queen, I get a Blizzard and then turn around and get a chocolate dip large cone on the way out.”
 Hendrick also told AP he underwent surgery on both a knee and an ear this year which required him to limit his personal interactions to avoid coronavirus. Aside from a two-week fishing trip, he said he’s been mostly connected to clients, customers and employees electronically.
 Because team owners are not permitted inside NASCAR’s bubble, Hendrick said he’s not attended races because he doesn’t want to watch from a suite. He does plan to attend the Nov. 8 season finale at Phoenix, the final race for seven- time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson before he retires.
 With one race to go to set the championship four, Hendrick has both Alex Bowman and Chase Elliott still in contention for a shot at the title. Should neither advance out of Sunday’s race at Martinsville Speedway, Hendrick will be locked out of the title round for the fourth consecutive year.
 If that happens, Hendrick still takes satisfaction in gains his organization has made this season.
 HMS suffered through growing pains following the retirements of Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Chevrolet’s 2018 introduction of the Camaro in the Cup Series bombed. Hendrick noted streamlining of his own organization — all the teams are now in the same building — as well as at Chevrolet, and a 2021 engine partnership between Hendrick and Richard Childress has improved his four-car program.
 His 2021 lineup will be his youngest ever as the four drivers combined average just 26 years old and Larson, in his seventh full season, will be the veteran. Hendrick doesn’t have a Cup champion among them — Johnson and Gordon won 11 titles between them — but the boss sees tremendous improvement in William Byron and Bowman, and a bright future for the organization.
 Hendrick last month promoted longtime executive Jeff Andrews to general manager and Chad Knaus, Johnson’s seven-time championship-winning crew chief, to head of competition.
 “I’m really pumped,” he said. “I believe on balance, we will be much stronger than we have been in a long time. And that’s across the board.”

Some perspective to the US Q3 advanced report yesterdayFor bank trade ideas, check out eFX PlusOn paper, the record rebound in US GDP in Q3 sounds stunning but it needs to be put into better context. Despite the bounce, overall economic output still remains well below pre-virus levels and there are caveats attached to it.After accounting for the figures, nominal GDP remained 2.7% below its level in Q4 2019 (⬆️) and in real terms, it is seen 3.5% below its level at the end of last year.While the rebound means that the US economy has recovered about 2/3 its output lost seen in Q2, the stimulus measures during the last few months were arguably a key reason helping to "prop up" the economy in the last quarter.All of that has been stripped away ahead of the election and with the virus situation worsening, the outlook bodes ill for another major rebound - if there even is one - in Q4.

MINNEAPOLIS - Minnesota's secretary of state said Thursday it's too late for voters to mail back their absentee ballots if they want to make sure their votes count, after an appeals court ruling indicated that mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day are at risk of being invalidated.
 A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that Minnesota absentee ballots arriving after Election Day should be separated from other ballots in case they are later invalidated by a final court order. The ruling doesn't block Minnesota's seven-day extension for counting absentee ballots outright, but puts the grace period in danger.
 “Voters should no longer place their absentee ballots in the mail,” Secretary of State Steve Simon said. “It is too late for you, practically speaking, to get it back. Don’t risk it.”
 The ruling doesn’t impact ballots received by the time polls close on Election Day, but sets the stage for post-election litigation. The case was sent back to a lower court for more proceedings.
 “What the court left unsettled was the question of whether, once and for all and finally, ballots will or won't be counted if received after Tuesday, Nov. 3,” Simon said. “The decision, to be candid, is not a model of clarity and it leaves open a lot of unanswered questions.”
 The decision is likely to create voter confusion, with people who haven't returned their absentee ballots scrambling to make sure their votes count. Simon said voters who still have absentee ballots in hand may drop them off at a designated location, vote early at an early voting station, or vote in person on Election Day. Those who already returned absentee ballots can track them online to see if they've been received.
 As of Thursday night, nearly 400,000 of some 2 million requested absentee ballots remained outstanding, Simon said.
 “The consequences of this order are not lost on us. We acknowledge and understand the concerns over voter confusion, election administration issues, and public confidence in the election," the majority wrote. But they said those problems were preferable to a post-election scenario where invalidated and valid votes are mixed.
 “Better to put those voters on notice now while they still have at least some time to adjust their plans and cast their votes in an unquestionably lawful way,” the majority wrote.
 The ruling is a win for Republicans, who argued that the extension — which had been approved in both state and federal courts due to the COVID-19 pandemic — violated federal law that establishes Nov. 3 as the date of the 2020 election.
 Democrats called the ruling “misguided” and “an attack on democracy."
 “Now, with just five days before election day, and Republicans surely heading for defeat at the polls, the Republican Party is responsible for potentially disenfranchising thousands of Minnesotans who were prepared to vote by mail in the coming days," state party Chairman Ken Martin said.
 State GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan called the ruling a “big win for election protection and freedom.”
 Minnesotans “already have six weeks for people to vote early,” Carnahan tweeted. She called the extra period “unnecessary and just a move by the left to play around with this election.”
 The case now goes back to U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel, who previously upheld a state court agreement that allowed ballots postmarked on or before Election Day to be counted if they are received by Nov. 10.

It is important to note that both pure protection life insurance covers and policies offering savings cum investment are important for individuals and have their own place. While, the former caters to life’s protection needs, the later secures the financial needs of an individual. Both these plans are different but equally important. When it comes to savings cum investment solutions offered by life insurers, they help customers create desired savings for long-term. In case an individual is looking to save and grow their money to achieve a long-term goal, saving and investment products offered by life insurance companies are a great option. These products offer completely tax free returns and the costs are extremely competitive when looked at from a long-term financial investment point of view. Additionally, these costs also cover mortality and offer an additional benefit of life cover which is anywhere between 10-20 times or more of the sum assured. So, if individuals are looking for pure life protection or life cover, they should look at insurance for sure. Additionally, if someone is looking for a savings plan, for a longer-term, in that scenario an insurance savings plan becomes highly comparable to any other financial instrument opted for a long-term benefit.

TAUNTON -- Have you seen the giant spider on the side of a house on Burt Street in Taunton? It's the handiwork of 42-year-old electrician Tim Isaacsen.
 Isaacsen said he's always been creative, inspired by his grandmother who was a great artist. But it wasn't until a few years ago when his wife Amy said she wanted some Halloween decorations that he combined his skills as an artist and an electrician to make something amazing.
 "My wife likes to decorate for Halloween. And it's probably her favorite. I'm a Christmas guy, but she likes to decorate for Halloween," he said. "And so I figured we'd do something in the in the front window. And I wanted to make it worth it."
 So Isaacsen had the idea for silhouettes, and used some tissue and construction paper to make some monsters for the window. Then, a few years later, Amy said she wanted a spider for the side of the house, so he figured he's take a crack at it.

 Using his skills as an electrician, he bent PVC pipe to make the legs, used a turtle-shaped sandbox for the body, horns from a fake viking helmet for the fangs and ball pit balls for the eggs.
 "The only thing scarier than a giant spider crawling on the side of a house is the potential for 1000 of them," he said, jokingly.
 Isaacsen said it took him a couple of days of staying up working in the driveway til 1 a.m. to create his masterpieces.
 "I think it feels better to see something up there that you put up yourself," he said. "I mean there are definitely a lot of cool Halloween decorations out there these days that you see. And I appreciate all of them. I like to drive around and see the other ones people put up. But if it's something that people took the extra step to do themselves, that makes it a little nicer."
 For now, Isaacsen isn't thinking of doing commissions, but he is planning to put more DIY decorations out in his yard. He hopes it inspires others to do the same.

DETROIT - Every day feels like a raw wound for Omari Barksdale.
 His sister, Laneeka Barksdale, died of COVID-19 in late March in Detroit — and since then, so have more than 226,000 Americans. Many were Black Americans whose communities were disproportionately devastated by the virus.
 Omari Barksdale, a Black man, watched with alarm as the toll of the country's racial injustice mounted. People of colour bore the brunt of pandemic-related job losses. Police shot and killed Breonna Taylor inside her Kentucky home, and a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into George Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd gasped, “I can't breathe,” in his final moments.
 The convergence of the pandemic, joblessness and police brutality has forced the U.S. to confront its centuries-old legacy of systemic racism this year. And for Barksdale and many Black Americans, it's turned next week's presidential election into a referendum on the future of race relations, an opportunity to take steps toward healing or the potential of a deeper divide.
 “It feels like half of me was taken away,” said Barksdale, who, in the weeks after his sister’s death, began leading a team of volunteers canvassing Michigan voters. “For many years, we’ve had this commentary about how far we’ve come, but if you look at the landscape and dynamics right now of America, we’re back in the ’50s and ’60s. The reasons for protesting are the same now as they were then: for the protection of Black lives, the opportunity for Black lives, and the understanding and value of Black lives.”
 Black voters will be decisive in shaping next week's results. Democrat Joe Biden is relying on strong turnout among Black voters in cities such as Detroit, Philadelphia and Milwaukee to tip critical swing states in his direction. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is focusing most of his effort on last-minute appeals to his core base of white voters.
 As of Thursday, more than 79 million votes had been cast in the 2020 general election, with Black voters making up almost 9% of that total, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the political data firm L2. In North Carolina, a battleground state seeing high turnout across the board, 60% of Black registered voters have already cast a ballot.
 “The soul of the nation is at risk,” longtime civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton said in an interview. “Another four years of Trump would completely set us back and the advancements that we’ve made towards equal rights, human rights and civil rights. It would take us 20 or 30 years, a generation, to get back what he would cement.”
 The election-year reckoning is the culmination of centuries of inequity and racism that far predates Trump's political career. But Trump has pulled at the nation's racial divide throughout his presidency.
 He blamed “both sides” for 2017 violence between white supremacists and anti- racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, and wondered why the U.S. was admitting so many immigrants from “shithole countries” like African nations. He said four Democratic congresswomen of colour should go back to the “broken and crime infested” countries they came from, ignoring the fact that all of the women are American citizens and three were born in the U.S.
 Trump was criticized in September for his initial refusal to outright condemn a far-right fascist group during a debate with Biden.
 “Donald Trump is an unabashed racist who not only revels in his ability to mock, scorn and create harm, he denies any culpability for the consequences,” said Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate.
 “I fear for our communities if he retains the seat of the presidency for four more years. I also have a deep worry that his continued occupation of that seat would result in those who intend us harm who will feel that they have carte blanche to do so,” said Abrams, who is Black. “My deep hope is that the demographic changes in our country, coupled with the consciences of white Americans who understand that he is wrong, they will actually do what’s right.”
 Trump points to criminal justice reform, opportunity zones and funding for historically Black colleges and universities as examples of what he’s done for Black Americans, but many critics argue his claims are exaggerated or undermined by his comments.
 After a summer of nationwide unrest that led to millions marching in the streets of America, Trump has billed himself as a leader who will restore “law and order” — an attempt to appeal to white grievances and allay white suburban fears.
 Just this week, Trump’s presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner said the president wants to help Black people in America, but they have to “want to be successful” for his policies to work, a comment that recalled racist stereotypes of Black Americans.
 “What we see is when racism goes unchecked and becomes institutionalized publicly and becomes a part of our administration,” said Jessica Byrd, who leads the Movement for Black Lives’ Electoral Justice Project and The Frontline, a multiracial coalition effort to galvanize voters. “We’ve seen firsthand the way that a vocal minority can become an extremist power building faction.”
 Biden has his own vulnerabilities on race. He has apologized for the poor treatment of Anita Hill when she testified before his Senate committee in 1991 to accuse then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. He's also expressed regret about provisions of a 1994 crime bill he supported that has been blamed for incarcerating a generation of Black men.

One of the Rays’ two charter planes had a lengthy mechanical delay in Dallas that caused one of the aircraft to be switched, and team said shortly after midnight that both planes had arrived back home.
 The commissioner’s office said it will consult with the players’ association as part of its investigation. The union was in the process of gathering facts on the events.
 Turner hit .307 with four homers and 23 RBIs in the pandemic-shortened season and .293 (17 for 58) with three homers and six RBIs in the postseason, including .320 with a pair of solo homers in the World Series.
 “Having a mask on and staying socially distanced, he wanted to come out and take a picture with the trophy, which can’t state strongly enough how big of a role he’s played in the success of this organization,” Friedman said.
 “But I think for him, just being a free agent, not knowing exactly how the future is going to play out, I don’t think there was anyone that was going to stop him from going out,” he said. “I think from at least my perspective and not watching it super closely with everything going on, but I think he was mindful of other people, especially other people that he hadn’t already been in contact with. This is something that we’re going to wrap our arms around tonight and in the morning and figure out where we’re going from here.”
 Turner, however, was visible on the field without a mask during the celebration. And Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was nearby, also not wearing a mask.
 “I haven’t seen the pictures,” Friedman said. “If there are people around them without masks, that’s not good optics at all. I haven’t seen them, so it’s hard for me to speak to it specifically.”
 “But I think from our standpoint, I think the people who were around him were people that would be in the contact tracing web, anyway, with just how closely a lot of us have been around each other,” he said. “And so now I think the subsequent tests we’re going to take are really important to figure out what we do and to make sure that any of us that are potentially positive do not spread it to other people.”
 Turner has served as a player representative on the union executive board and spoke about the protocols on Sept. 29, a day ahead of the Dodgers’ postseason opener.
 “Obviously there’s a lot of protocols and things that we’re allowed to do and not allowed to do in getting tested every day, and I would say it’s been a pretty successful season getting to this point and getting to the playoffs,” he said then.
 “I was probably in that category where I was optimistic that we were going to have a season, but there was definitely some doubt whether or not it was going to happen. So to be sitting here today watching playoff baseball as the American League kind of kicks off their wild-card round, I would say that we did a good job and I commend everyone for taking it serious and being responsible and making good choices and allowing us to get to this point.”
 He addressed the success of reaching the World Series despite the pandemic on Oct. 19, a day before Game 1.
 “I think it’s ultimately a testament to the players for being responsible and making good choices and doing everything that we had to do to ensure that the season was able to go on,” he said. “So I tip my cap to every player who put the uniform on and took that risk of playing and was responsible about it and did it the right way and enabled us to have a full season and now be able to participate in a World Series.”

She also announced that a community workgroup, the Equity Leadership Team, will follow up on conversations Gardner held with various small groups earlier this year as marches and protests for racial justice were held in Frederick and around the country.
 That group will consist of about 20 members and include Frederick Alderman Roger Wilson, Council Vice President Michael Blue and other county officials and community members.
 Hughes said he understands Frederick County has a wide range of political views and that it would be important to listen and “build bridges” between community organizations and county government.
 He pointed to the civil rights movement in the 1960s, when many civil rights leaders — Stokely Carmichael, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lewis and Huey Newton — had different followings.
 “They all wanted the same thing, but they came at it differently … but the context sometimes requires a different approach,” Hughes said. “They brought things to the table, but at the end of the day, they were pursuing the same thing, pursuing equitable and fair outcomes and opportunities for everyone.”
 He recognizes there is a different feeling about racial issues this year, and that leadership is needed to navigate those times.
 “People are taking to the streets, people want their voices to heard,” Hughes said. “There is an awakening—people who have not been in the struggle, and … who had maybe not an interest in it—are now having that awareness be increased, and so folks are looking for people and asking: What do we do?
 “I wouldn’t take a position to serve as a figurehead, I’m not taking a position to be a token,” he added about his role. “I’m taking a position and being supported to make a difference … some things take a little bit more time than others, but that doesn’t mean the ball stops moving.”

“The price-hike, unemployment and the dwindling economy have ruined the poor segment of the society while the rulers are taking huge loans from the international financial institutions and enjoying luxurious life,” the JI chief told media during his visit to Chakdara to condole the murder of two- year old girl child Hareem Shah. He said that the government had become dumb, deaf and blind, which did not see issues and incidents happening here and there every day.
 He said that people were being pushed to the wall by increasing prices of daily use items and medicines and their issues were ignored. The JI chief condemned the display of blasphemous caricatures in France and the genocide of Muslims across the world, saying the Muslims rulers had turned a blind eye towards the problems being confronted by the Ummah. The senator added that the murder of minor Hareem Shah was a question mark for the rulers and said that such incidents had become order of the day, which must be stopped forthwith.
 He suggested that Zainab Alert law should be amended to award exemplary punishment to those culprits involved in the rape and murder of minor children. He said that anarchy, obscenity, kidnapping for ransom, killing, kidnapping and rape and murder of children were on the rise in the country, which was a cause of concern for all and sundry. He said that people were paying taxes to the government hence they must be provided security and protection of life and property.
 Meanwhile, the Chakdara Bar Association in its meeting condemned the killing of girl child Hareem Shah in Chakdara, martyrdom of students and teachers in a bomb blast in a Madrassa in Dir Colony in Peshawar and display of blasphemous cartoons in France. The meeting decided that no lawyer would plead the case of the accused involved in the murder of Hareem Shah. The participants urged the government and district administration to arrest the accused and award an exemplary punishment to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in future. Also, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, Chakdara chapter, staged a protest against the exhibition of sacrilegious sketches in France. JUI tehsil chief Maulana Shah Hussain, district general secretary Javed Iqbal, Maulana Ghulamullah Haqqani, Maulana Gul Raham Daryar and others addressed the protest rally. Chanting slogans against the French government, the speakers demanded the rulers to sever diplomatic and trade ties forthwith.

Turner was pulled from the game following the seventh inning after MLB was notified that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He was quarantined in a doctor’s office off to the side, Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said.
 Turner later returned to the field with a mask to celebrate the Dodgers’ title. He then took down his mask and posed for a team photo on the field.
 “Immediately upon receiving notice from the laboratory of a positive test, protocols were triggered, leading to the removal of Justin Turner from last night’s game,” MLB said in a statement Wednesday. “Turner was placed into isolation for the safety of those around him. However, following the Dodgers’ victory, it is clear that Turner chose to disregard the agreed-upon joint protocols and the instructions he was given regarding the safety and protection of others.
 “While a desire to celebrate is understandable, Turner’s decision to leave isolation and enter the field was wrong and put everyone he came in contact with at risk. When MLB Security raised the matter of being on the field with Turner, he emphatically refused to comply.”
 Turner became a free agent when his $64 million, four-year contract expired following the victory.
 Turner’s agent, Greg Genske, did not immediately respond to a text from The Associated Press seeking comment.
 “Last night, nasal swabs were conducted on the Dodgers’ traveling party,” MLB said. “Both the Rays and Dodgers were tested again today and their travel back to their home cities will be determined after being approved by the appropriate authorities.”
 Both teams traveled home from the Dallas area on Wednesday in coordination with their local health authorities, a person familiar with the arrangements said, speaking on condition of anonymity because no announcement was made.
 No additional players received positive results from rapid PCR tests early Wednesday, the person said, but the wife of one Rays player tested positive, the person said. The wife and the player did not travel with the team and were to travel on their own, the person said.
 A private plane was being arranged for Turner’s travel, the person said.

“I was just so nervous,” Jack recalled in an email of his famous play. “I had just found out that morning what I was going to do. My dad helped me practice taking the handoff properly shortly before it happened. At the time, I didn’t know what the end zone line was. My dad just told me to keep running until the big white line at the end, so that is what I did.”
 Since then, Jack has experienced recurrences in 2014 and in 2018. His condition is treated with medication, according to his father, and extensive checkups and lab work every three months.
 “The whole situation is really overwhelming and feels like a nightmare,” Brianna Hoffman said in an email. “At the same time, I look at my husband and my kids and I know that they need me, so it’s easy for me to be strong for them. We know we have been given a lot of challenges, but together as a family, we will continue to fight. We believe in the power of prayer and continue to rely on our faith to guide us through.”
 Jack has adapted as his treatment has evolved. He takes nearly two dozen pills a day to manage his condition, which includes occasional seizures. “The treatment has just become part of my day and is kind of a habit now and just something I know I need to do daily, so I just do it,” Jack said in an email. “Luckily, the treatment that I’m on doesn’t cause any side effects on my body.”
 Although epilepsy is a side effect that keeps him from doing some things, Jack plays on the offensive and defensive lines as a freshman at West Holt High, the fifth Hoffman to wear No. 75 on the football field. He said also participates in baseball, basketball and track and field, he said. Andy Hoffman said, “I think he had enough snaps to letter this year.”
 Andy Hoffman spoke from home last week, preparing for his latest round of radiation treatment while Jack was in Omaha with his mother, receiving an MRI exam. Copies of the book Andy had written about Jack had just arrived. The father called “Yards After Contact” his “last hurrah.”
 Still, Andy had sports on his mind.
 “Hopefully we can squeeze in our New Mexico elk hunt — booked it in September. I’m not up to shooting, but I am going to have Ava shoot for me,” he wrote last week on the Team Jack Foundation website. “Jack is down for an elk as well. . . .

He doesn't feel like Trump or Biden has addressed issues that matter most to Latinos. He's still planning to vote, but hasn't decided whom he'll back.
 “A lot of people have friends who are immigrants, and they get discriminated against because they don’t have papers and they struggle," Gomez said. “The (president) says that he supports Latinos and immigrants, but I haven’t seen anything from him but putting us down.”
 But matters involving race are not only at the forefront for voters of color. As they've watched several forms of racial injustice collide this year, many white Americans have been forced to grapple with uncomfortable truths about racism.
 Detroit resident Colton Dale, a 27-year-old white man who is the vice president of the Grosse Pointe Democratic Club and a lifelong Democrat, said he's had conversations with family members and co-workers who support Trump. He's spent time trying to convince them, as well as potential voters he encounters, of the “chaos” Trump's presidency has caused.
 ”I think people, even Republicans and his supporters, they know who he is, especially four years down the road," Dale said. “I just try to draw a contrast and say that we would be living in a better and brighter America under a Joe Biden administration as opposed to another four years of Trump. People are just ready to end this nightmare."
 The Biden campaign has also spent a significant amount of time and resources to connect with younger voters, who turned out in droves over the summer to protest police brutality and racism.

The sponsor of “Marsy’s Law,” the crime victims’ bill of rights on this fall’s ballot, said Thursday the rights are needed to give victims a role in the criminal justice process they don’t currently have.
 Sen. Whitney Westerfield, a Hopkinsville Republican and chairman of the state Senate’s committee on judicial issues, sponsored the crime victims’ bill during this year’s General Assembly session. The bill was approved by lawmakers, but the bill would include the rights of crime victims in the state constitution, and must be approved by voters.
 Marsy’s Law was previously approved by lawmakers and voters in 2018, but the law was invalidated by the state Supreme Court, which ruled the language on the ballot was insufficient for voters to fully understand the law.
 Westerfield discussed the constitutional amendment in a webinar sponsored by Kentucky Wesleyan College’s Stanley Reed Pre-Law and Politics Society. The idea behind “Marsy’s Law” is that “crime victims deserve to be treated with respect and dignity in the (court) process,” Westerfield said.
 The rights for crime victims already in state law are few, and apply only to a narrow classification of people, Westerfied said.
 “We only have two or three rights in statute … but the kicker is those rights only apply to the victims of 21 crimes,” Westerfield said. Another bill passed during the session would expand crime victim rights to more people if Marsy’s Law is approved.
 The measure voters will decide on contains 12 rights, including the right of victims to be notified of court proceedings, the right to be present and heard at proceedings, to be notified if a defendant is released or escapes and the right to have judges consider the safety of the victim when setting a defendant’s bail, among others. Victims would also have the right to have those rights enforced in court.
 Just adding the rights to state statute wouldn’t put them on equal footing with the rights of defendants, Westerfield said.
 “We don’t want to give the victim (more rights) than the accused,” Westerfield said, but added that victim rights shouldn’t be subordinate to the right of defendants. The constitutional amendment would prevent victim rights from being changed or weakened by legislators, he said.

On paper, the record rebound in US GDP in Q3 sounds stunning but it needs to be put into better context. Despite the bounce, overall economic output still remains well below pre-virus levels and there are caveats attached to it.
   
 After accounting for the figures, nominal GDP remained 2.7% below its level in Q4 2019 (⬆️) and in real terms, it is seen 3.5% below its level at the end of last year.
   
 While the rebound means that the US economy has recovered about 2/3 its output lost seen in Q2, the stimulus measures during the last few months were arguably a key reason helping to "prop up" the economy in the last quarter.
   
 All of that has been stripped away ahead of the election and with the virus situation worsening, the outlook bodes ill for _another_ major rebound - if there even is one - in Q4.

"The simple action of Philae stamping into the side of the crevice allowed us to work out that this ancient, billions-of-years-old, icy-dust mixture is extraordinarily soft - fluffier than froth on a cappuccino, or the foam found in a bubble bath or on top of waves at the seashore," O'Rourke said.
 The data also allowed for an estimate of the comet's porosity. The researchers found that roughly 75 percent of 67P/C-G is empty space, consistent with a previous analysis. That's comparable to pumice. The rocks on the comet, the researchers said, are probably more like styrofoam than the heavy boulders they appear to be.
 It's a fascinating discovery. This sturdy-looking chunk of space rock (and ice) that has survived hanging around the Solar System for 4.5 billion years is barely holding itself together.
 "The mechanical tension that holds the comet ice together in this chunk of dust is just 12 pascal," explained astronomer Jean-Baptiste Vincent of the DLR Institute of Planetary Research Institute in Germany. "That is not much more than 'nothing'."
 This could be very useful information to bear in mind for designing comet probes in the future.

Luckily, 90 percent of people in the study who overdosed on paracetamol received the antidote within 8-10 hours, reducing their risk of liver damage and death.
 Yet most of these situations could have been avoided entirely. If paracetamol is not suitable for chronic pain, Burden says, then pack sizes should represent that. They shouldn't contain 40 tablets or more.
 "At the very least, packs of the 1,000 milligram tablets should contain a smaller number of tablets," says Burden. Even if a patient needs a higher dose, it might be safer to prescribe two tablets of 500 mg.
 While it's too early to determine the exact cause of the poisonings, public health experts have a few ideas. Patients might be mistaking stronger tablets for weaker ones, unknowingly doubling their dose. If this happens in young children, one pill is sometimes enough to put them well above the daily minimum and at risk of poisoning.
 Another part of the problem comes from a lack of communication. Many doctors and pharmacists don't take the time to explain to their patients how paracetamol can build up in the body, how it can impact the liver and how the drug is limited when it comes to chronic pain.
 These sorts of mistakes are easy to mitigate, we just need to draw attention to the problem.

But the temporary setback was probably what the industry needed to speed up some much-needed changes. Both Sunrun and Sunnova noted in their most recent earnings calls that they had shifted sales to a digital model. That is probably positive in the long term because digital marketing is more cost efficient than going door to door, according to Sophie Karp, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Overhead costs, including those involved in customer acquisition, had been rising as a share of residential solar pricing over the years.

Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel is expected at a court hearing Friday as Connecticut prosecutors decide whether to retry him for the bludgeoning death of a fellow teenager in 1975.
 Skakel has been free on bail since 2013, when a state judge vacated his murder conviction in the death of Martha Moxley, who was killed in their wealthy Greenwich neighborhood when both she and Skakel were 15 years old. The case went cold for 25 years until Skakel’s arrest in 2000.
 Friday is the 45th anniversary of the slaying.
 The nature of the hearing wasn't clear as the case remains sealed under a state juvenile offender law. But it was expected to be closely watched for any indication of how prosecutors intend to proceed in a case where the defendant, now 60 years old, already served over a decade in prison and the passage of so many decades would complicate efforts to retry the case.
 Moxley’s brother, John Moxley, said in an interview this week that he and his mother, Dorthy, would be comfortable if the state dropped the case, because they have grown weary after two decades of court battles. But they remain convinced Skakel is the killer.
 “My mom’s 88. She doesn’t need to go through another trial,” John Moxley said. “It’s like someone getting ready to run a marathon. You know there’s going to be pain. Do you really want to do it again?”
 Skakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy’s widow, Ethel Kennedy, was convicted of murder in 2002 and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Several appeals followed. After serving 11 years behind bars, Skakel was freed on $1.2 million bail when a judge overturned his conviction in 2013, saying his trial lawyer failed to adequately represent him.

Corbyn’s tenure was marred by persistent complaints of anti-Semitism in the party and criticism of the leader’s response.
 He was suspended after saying he did not accept all the report’s findings, that his attempts at reforming complaints processes had been stalled by “obstructive party bureaucracy” and that the scale of the problem had been overstated for political reasons.
 “In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation,” Labour said in a statement.
 The party added it had removed the Labour whip from Corbyn, meaning that the former leader will no longer be able to take part in House of Commons votes as a Labour lawmaker.
 Starmer said he accepted the EHRC’s report “in full” and would implement all its recommendations.
 “It is a day of shame for the Labour Party. We have failed Jewish people... I am truly sorry for all the pain and grief that has been caused,” said Starmer, who held a senior role under Corbyn’s leadership but has tried to stamp out the problem since taking over.
 “Never again will we fail to tackle anti-Semitism and never again will we lose your trust.”
 According to British media, there’s growing anger among the Unions - Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communications Workers’ Union, said the decision to suspend Corbyn is “fundamentally wrong and needs to change”.
 “The EHRC report is a serious and detailed document everyone in the Party should read and understand Keir Starmer’s political decision to suspend Jeremy Corbyn - a lifelong anti-racist campaigner - flies in the face of the report,” he tweeted.
 Jeremy Corbyn has urged his Labour supporters to “stay in the party” to fight for left-wing principles following the decision to suspend him.
 In a broadcast interview in Islington following the removal of the party whip in the wake of his reaction to EHRC report, the former Labour leader called for calm and for members to “make the case” for left-wing values internally.
 “Quite clearly the decision was made in a very quick way and I would just say, hang on a minute, let’s all keep a bit calm, let’s think again about this whole issue,” he said.
 “Our party comes together to fight racism and injustice but we also come together to bring about economic justice for the people of this country.”
 “That is what unites our movement and our party and that is what I appeal to members to focus on. Don’t go away, don’t leave the party. Stay in the party and argue the case for economic and social justice in our society.”
 During the interview, the MP refused to retract his earlier statements, saying the “public perception” about how many members were under investigation for anti-Semitism was “very different” to the reality.
 But he added: “I’ve explained what I said, I’ve explained what I meant by it. I’m not diminishing or minimising the issue of anti-Semitism.
 “It is serious, it is real, it does exist. I’ve explained what the statement was designed to say, simply the size of the issue. But one anti-Semite is one too many and I’ve made that clear to everyone in the party.”

“I fear for our communities if he retains the seat of the presidency for four more years. I also have a deep worry that his continued occupation of that seat would result in those who intend us harm who will feel that they have carte blanche to do so,” said Abrams, who is Black. “My deep hope is that the demographic changes in our country, coupled with the consciences of white Americans who understand that he is wrong, they will actually do what’s right.”
 Trump points to criminal justice reform, opportunity zones and funding for historically Black colleges and universities as examples of what he’s done for Black Americans, but many critics argue his claims are exaggerated or undermined by his comments.
 After a summer of nationwide unrest that led to millions marching in the streets of America, Trump has billed himself as a leader who will restore “law and order” — an attempt to appeal to white grievances and allay white suburban fears.
 Just this week, Trump’s presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner said the president wants to help Black people in America, but they have to “want to be successful” for his policies to work, a comment that recalled racist stereotypes of Black Americans.
 “What we see is when racism goes unchecked and becomes institutionalized publicly and becomes a part of our administration,” said Jessica Byrd, who leads the Movement for Black Lives’ Electoral Justice Project and The Frontline, a multiracial coalition effort to galvanize voters. “We’ve seen firsthand the way that a vocal minority can become an extremist power building faction.”

Before moving to the valley in 2017, she ran Rim to Rim in the Grand Canyon and the Oregon Coast 50k (her first ultra). While living in Colorado, she joined a running club providing a gateway to ultra events. She also did traditional solo bike touring.
 A central Massachusetts native, her family visited the valley to hike and camp, but it wasn’t until she moved here that she realized the full magnitude of its multi-sport opportunities.
 She recently started work as documentary film producer after being employed in digital marketing at a valley agency and also runs a small handcrafted art business called Mountains For Breakfast.
 To prepare for Vermont, Gorman spent long days in the saddle with a few overnight trips to dial in her gear — always a work in progress. Biking, running, yoga and meditation are ways for her to maintain balance.
 “This was more than a bike race,” she said. “It was a multitude of beginnings. A series of moments connected through landscapes and humans, new pathways and unknowns, fear and joy, resilience and perseverance. An opportunity to be fully present. An opportunity to practice discernment.”
 She had highs and lows. On her last day, 120 miles, the pint-sized dynamo relished a super strong grind up Brandon’s Gap. Some lows turned into highs like when she was unsure of her first ride at night. She texted the race director about the stretch, a rugged ATV trail hike-a-bike. She did it. The race director greeted her at the end at a campground at 2 a.m. with a warm smile.
 After a slog through a storm outside Chester she yearned to make camp in a safe and dry place, and to recharge herself and her devices. At camp, she had a conversation with a race host who made her think beyond the race to “realize that this bike ride was so much bigger than me. It was raising the bar for other women to face their fears and dreams.”
 She experienced trail magic, but also self-doubt when the route took her close to her truck and she weighed whether to continue or go home. A text from her 11 year-old niece inspired her to press on.
 She was also encouraged through dot stalking. Carrying a tracker, others could follow her “dot” along the route and message her, lighting up her phone with inspiration.
 “I hope this inspires anyone to not be afraid of knowing who they really are. When we stretch the limits of our comfort zone we are preparing our minds and our nervous system for the next time around,” she said.

CHICAGO - The mother of a 17-year-old accused of killing two demonstrators in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is among those slated to testify Friday during a hearing in Illinois to decide if her son should be extradited across the border to stand trial on homicide charges.
 Kyle Rittenhouse’s lawyers also planned to call an expert on self-defence, a prison-safety consultant and two former homicide detectives in a long shot bid to convince Judge Paul Novak in Waukegan, Illinois, not to turn their client over to Wisconsin authorities.
 The case has become a rallying point for some conservatives who see Rittenhouse as a patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during unrest in Kenosha following the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer. Others portray him as a domestic terrorist who incited protesters by showing up wielding a rifle.
 State-to-state extraditions are typically formalities and judges rarely refuse to OK another state’s request to transfer a suspect. Efforts to fight extradition are nearly always in vain but can help attorneys to buy time to compile evidence and prepare a defence.
 A recent defence filing listing witnesses it wants to call at the hearing in the Lake County Courthouse in Waukegan names Rittenhouse’s mom, Wendy Rittenhouse. The documents didn't offer details, saying she would discuss the circumstances of her son’s arrest.
 Prosecutors aren’t expected to call anyone to the witness stand, saying in filings of their own that it's the role of a Wisconsin judge, not one in Illinois, to gauge whether there are sufficient grounds for charges.
 The most serious charge Rittenhouse faces in Wisconsin is first-degree intentional homicide for fatally shooting two protesters, which carries a life prison sentence. He is also charged with attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third protesters, as well as a misdemeanour charge of underage firearm possession.
 The killings occurred Aug. 25, two days after a police officer trying to arrest Jacob Blake shot him seven times in the back after a brief scuffle, leaving Blake paralyzed from the waist down. A video of the shooting posted online sparked outrage and helped spur on the protests.
 Rittenhouse and the man he allegedly injured are white, as were the two men killed.
 A day after the shooting, Rittenhouse surrendered to police in his Illinois hometown of Antioch, just across the Wisconsin border and some 10 miles (16.09 kilometres) southwest of Kenosha.

But he's put Black voters at the centre of his 2020 campaign. His presidential hopes were rescued in February when Black voters in South Carolina rallied around him, powering him through Super Tuesday wins and helping deliver the Democratic nomination.
 Unlike Trump, he has acknowledged systemic racism and has pledged to address it.
 “Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, doesn’t believe that systemic racism is a problem, and won’t say that Black lives matter,” Biden said Tuesday in Atlanta. “We know Black lives matter.”
 In the final stretch of the campaign, Black voters are organizing to make sure their votes are counted. LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, said her organization has travelled across 15 states to galvanize voters, including in rural counties and smaller cities that are often ignored.
 “America is at its tipping point," Brown said. “We’re in a perfect storm of being at the intersection of a health pandemic, an intersection of a lot of uncertainty around the political future of this country, and the economic future of this country and blatant open racism. All of that is forcing us to deal with the evils of this country that we have not dealt with, which is quite frankly sexism and racism.”
 But some voters of colour are still making up their minds. Victor Gomez, a 39-year-old Latino man in Hayward, California, said the pandemic and immigration are top concerns.
 He doesn't feel like Trump or Biden has addressed issues that matter most to Latinos. He's still planning to vote, but hasn't decided whom he'll back.
 “A lot of people have friends who are immigrants, and they get discriminated against because they don’t have papers and they struggle," Gomez said. “The (president) says that he supports Latinos and immigrants, but I haven’t seen anything from him but putting us down.”
 But matters involving race are not only at the forefront for voters of colour. As they've watched several forms of racial injustice collide this year, many white Americans have been forced to grapple with uncomfortable truths about racism.
 Detroit resident Colton Dale, a 27-year-old white man who is the vice- president of the Grosse Pointe Democratic Club and a lifelong Democrat, said he's had conversations with family members and co-workers who support Trump. He's spent time trying to convince them, as well as potential voters he encounters, of the “chaos” Trump's presidency has caused.
 ”I think people, even Republicans and his supporters, they know who he is, especially four years down the road," Dale said. “I just try to draw a contrast and say that we would be living in a better and brighter America under a Joe Biden administration as opposed to another four years of Trump. People are just ready to end this nightmare."
 The Biden campaign has also spent a significant amount of time and resources to connect with younger voters, who turned out in droves over the summer to protest police brutality and racism.
 For the past several months, Tylik McMillan, the National Action Network's national director of youth and college, has focused on educating first-time voters, college students and young voters who have been disengaged with the political process about what's at stake.
 “The reality is when I step out of these doors, we're still just Black in America, and I can be the next George Floyd. I can be the next Ahmaud Arbery. And to have a leader at the highest office not understand that racism is real in this country, it's a problem," said McMillan, 24.
 But regardless of the election's outcome, America will be left to grapple with the “fault lines” and fractures of racism and inequity that have been made clear.
 “Nov. 3 will be a referendum on Black lives, it will be a referendum on structural change, and will be a referendum on whether, when we are experiencing all of this chaos, are we going to look to one another for solutions and embrace one another or are we going to look towards one another with fear and suspicion?” said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of Working Families Party, who is also a leader of The Frontline. “The movement, now the largest social movement in our country’s history, will be the story of 2020, whatever the outcome.”
