And of course, there's the problem of access. While insurance coverage for insulin pumps is widely established, this is not the case for the CGM component. Medicare doesn't cover CGM technology, meaning that people now must give up those devices or pay out of pocket when they reach age 65. The JDRF is one of several organizations lobbying to change that, as well as to make sure that all payers recognize both the health and economic advantages of new diabetes technologies.

A record-breaking number of early votes -- some 100 million -- have already been cast in an election that has the country on edge and is being closely watched in capitals around the world.
 The 77-year-old Biden, who served for eight years as vice president to Barack Obama, leads Trump in national polls and in many of the battleground states that will decide the White House.
 The former senator from Delaware, who is making his third bid for the presidency, began his day with a visit to the church in Wilmington, Delaware, where his son, Beau Biden, and first wife and daughter are buried.
 Trump, 74, who is seeking to become the first US president to win reelection after being impeached, dismissed the polls showing him trailing Biden. "I think we have a very solid chance of winning," he said on Tuesday morning on "Fox and Friends." "We think we’re doing very well everywhere. The crowds have been incredible."
 "Our country can never be the same country if they win," Trump said, adding that America would become a "socialist" nation. At the same time, Trump has cast doubt on the integrity of the election and threatened legal challenges, claiming the only way he can lose is if the results are "rigged."
 Casting her vote in New York, Megan Byrnes-Borderan, 35, said Trump’s threats were "part of why it is so scary." "I believe that Trump will go through all odds to try to win the election," she said.
 Trump has waged a campaign against mail-in voting for months, claiming it could lead to fraud and all ballots should be tabulated on Election Day. Several states, including battlegrounds Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, do not begin counting mail-in ballots until Election Day itself.
 Besides the White House, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are at stake, and Democrats are expected to hold and possibly expand their majority in the chamber. Roughly one-third of the Senate is up for grabs and Republicans risk losing their 53-47 majority.
 The bitter divisions and passions sparked by the bruising election campaign are sure to leave one side disappointed and have sparked fears of unrest. In Washington and many other cities, stores have been boarding up and law enforcement is on high alert.
 In a tweet flagged with a warning label by Twitter, Trump said a slow vote count in crucial Pennsylvania could lead to "rampant and unchecked cheating." "It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!" he tweeted.
 Biden has focused his attacks on Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic which has left more than 231,000 people dead in the United States, and the divisive nature of his presidency.
 "We’re done with the chaos! We’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility," Biden said at an election eve rally in Cleveland, Ohio. "We’re coming together for a big win tomorrow," Biden said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by pop superstar Lady Gaga. "It’s time to stand up and take back our democracy."
 Biden, like Hillary Clinton in 2016, is expected to win the popular vote but all eyes are on the 538-member Electoral College that ultimately determines the winner of the race. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win and it may come down to voters in the tossup states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 Trump won 306 electoral votes in 2016 and he predicted on Tuesday he would do even better this time. "I think we’ll top it," he said. Trump, who was briefly knocked off the campaign trail in early October by a bout with Covid-19, wrapped up his campaign with a whirlwind day of rallies, addressing supporters twice in Michigan and making stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Just like the rest of 2020, we're about to have an unprecedented Election Day.
 Election Day 2020 is really more like Election Week (or, God forbid, Election Month), thanks to the large number of mail-in ballots cast because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike years past, it's unlikely we'll be able to call a winner Tuesday evening in the presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. And beyond the time it takes to count the ballots, legal battles could follow results - lawyers have already lined up across the nation to challenge voting rules and individual votes.
 It is, quite frankly, overwhelming just to vote this year, let alone follow every election update and news development. We want to help you take care of your mental health while you stay informed.
 If you've already voted (and if you haven't voted yet, visit USA TODAY's voter resources page for help), we offer some wisdom, distractions and comfort in what is going to be a stressful week for everyone.
 Be patient, if you can
 We live in an impatient society. We want everything right now (two-day shipping! instant downloads!) and having to wait longer to find out the results of what has felt like an extra-long election cycle can be stressful.
 But preparing yourself for a long haul can help make this week easier. As USA TODAY editor-in-chief Nicole Carroll put it, "The number of mail-in and absentee ballots in many states means counting could go on for days. The delay doesn't mean there is a problem. It means the system is working, and states are ensuring every ballot is counted."
 Limit your news consumption to what you need to know
 You don't need to be glued to your phone or TV screen to ensure you hear important election news.
 "There is a fine line between being an informed citizen and making yourself crazy with all the headlines and social media conversations," says Dr. Linda Anegawa, a primary care physician with virtual health platform PlushCare. "These activities can become not only a time suck, but it can drain your emotional energy."
 If you aren't learning anything new and you are feeling anxious, it's probably a sign you need a break.
 Do something else
 It's OK to spend time this week taking care of your mental health. In fact, it's extra-important to do so when the news is stressful.
 "These are challenging times for us all, so it's critical that we care for our emotional and physical health more than ever," says Anegawa. "It's important that we all fortify ourselves in every sense of the word."
 Mediation, mindfulness, distraction and entertainment can help us relax during this crazy week. Here are some ways you might channel your jittery energy into a non-election activity:
 You can watch one of the best shows on Netflix. Or Hulu. Or Amazon. Or HBO Max. Or Peacock. There is so much TV at your fingertips ready for a distracting binge-watch.
 If you would rather watch a movie than commit to a TV show, here are film critic Brian Truitt's favorites from 2020 (so far). For a kid-friendly option, try one of these 25 great movies.
 Still need a movie? Try one of our 100 favorites. There's bound to be one on the list that you'll love.
 Or maybe you're more of a reader. There's nothing like curling up with a good book. Try downloading one of these top 20 for fall.
 Sam Smith, Bon Jovi and Dolly Parton all released new music in October. Spend some time zoning out with your headphones.
 Start your holiday shopping. There are plenty of sales already starting, but may we suggest one of these 15 products that will help with stress relief. Maybe you need them for yourself. Maybe you need them right now.
 If you don't want to spend money right now, you could also try your hand at DIYing some of these fall fashion trends at home without shopping.
 Plan your safe Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other medical experts have cautioned against big family get-togethers, but that doesn't mean Thanksgiving won't be festive. Special menus (maybe try Cornish game hens instead of a turkey), Zoom calls with your family, crafts and more can make your Thanksgiving special.
 Stress bake. It's time-consuming, fun and oh-so-tasty. We have recipes for beginners, moderate bakers and experts here. And if you are interested in bread and want it fast, here are some bread recipes that don't require yeast.
 Meditate. If you've never tried meditation before, here are some tips for getting started.
 We recently spoke to some astronauts about how they handle anxiety and isolation. Here are five tips they have for taking care of your mental health.
 Sleep. Daylight saving time is hard enough to adjust to without staying up too late.
 2020 has been trying for all of us. Do whatever you can to stay well during this crazy week in this crazy year. And if you need more support, USA TODAY's newsletter Staying Apart, Together is dedicated to helping you cope with the pandemic and other stressors in your life. It always has a cute pet picture. You can sign up here.
 And don't worry, the election will still be there when you turn back to the news. Follow USA TODAY's coverage for accurate, up-to-date results and analysis.

For his 45th documentary feature Frederick Wiseman trains his lens on his native Boston to record all things municipal unfolding in the cement encased corridors of Gerhard Kallmann's infamous Brutalist facade. The retrospective of how we operate and function in the Hub is an engrossing four-and-half-hour watch (yes, you heard that right) that amazingly goes by in a blip and serves as something of an eerie -- and taunting -- time capsule. Shot during 2018 and 2019, one segment has Mayor Marty Walsh and authorities preparing for the Wold Champion Red Sox Duck Boat celebration. Later we see fans chanting "Mookie, Mookie, Mookie." Betts famously left us in 2019 and recently performed his heroics in the 2020 World Series for that team we vanquished in 2018 (the L.A. Dodgers), and all that Wiseman's camera captures, strangely feels from another era as the city bustles in pre-COVID normalcy -- one can only imagine what a 2020-2021 version of "City Hall" might look like.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to MetroWestDailyNews.com to sign up for Entertainment Headlines and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 The Government Center delve unfolds in a series of chapter-esque meanders between the micro and macro with plenty of shots of Boston's iconic skyline and landmarks to root you. The rendering should make plenty of Beantowners proud and Walsh, seemingly ever aware of the camera, comes off crisp, progressive and inclusive -- a shining illumination that may pose something of an extra hurdle for upcoming challenger Michelle Wu and others. In Wiseman's classic observant, cinema verite style (fly-on-the-wall) there are several long takes of municipal proceedings such as the budget review where presenters effusively tout the investment in infrastructure as a win-win because it not only betters the community, but also makes the city's debt more appealing to bond investors. It's a cut-and-dry matter that under Wiseman's eye is more interesting and accessible than it sounds, but "City Hall' is most affecting when following the day-to-day operations of front liners, namely the 311 help center workers trying to iron out neighborhood issues or city magistrates mitigating parking tickets -- an anxious expecting father who parked in front of a hydrant and an incredulous old-schooler who didn't know there was resident parking along Congress Street -- and then there are those out in the community removing trash and providing subsidized veterinary care.
 What's truly amazing to note too is that Wiseman, at the age of 90, is still cranking out documentaries on a near annual basis and does all the editing to boot. For those not familiar with the works of the Academy Award honored documentarian, a law professor at BU and Brandeis before picking up the camera, they're slice of life exposes that quietly drink in their subjects without question, preface or prod the way you might get from a Michael Moore ("Roger & Me," or "Fahrenheit 9/11") or Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me"). The result conjures an uncanny sense of intimacy; there's no barrier, you are organically and viscerally part of the scene. "City Hall" in scope and focus feels like a natural addition to the the director's unofficial community series that began with "Aspen" (1991) and includes "Belfast, Maine" (1999)" and "Jackson Heights" (2015). Must see Wiseman films in my not-so-humble opinion are "Boxing Gym" (2010) and his controversial first film, "Titicut Follies" (1967) about the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, which, because of its graphic nature, was banned from being shown in Massachusetts until the early 1990s.
 The most moving and telling scenes in "City Hall" are those steeped in earnest reveals and communal conflict. Talking to veterans afflicted by addiction and PTSD, Walsh shares candidly his dark days as an alcoholic. The connection both onscreen and in the room is immediate and palpable, something that doesn't quite register as much when Walsh underscores his Irish heritage as a bridge to a Latino community. Then there's the Thanksgiving feast for those challenged by Down syndrome and similar arresting disorders where Walsh and crew dutifully serve expectant diners and cap it all off with dancing. Wiseman never lets his lens sway you, but if you don't have a bittersweet bump inside you, you probably didn't flinch when Old Yeller died. The big rub in the film comes during a community outreach meeting run by a predominately Asian coalition of businessmen seeking to institute a recreational cannabis facility in a predominately Black and brown section of Dorchester. The two sides talk at each other, the rhetoric's tinged with the annoyance of not being heard and there's the clear fear of being taken advantage of, with the city and the Massachusetts Canabis Control Commission -- who are not in the room -- taking the brunt of the shots. It's a telling back and forth that raises the question of equitable economic development and how to earnestly empower a community in the process without gutting them.
 One of the things that makes Wiseman's films so captivating is the sense of cadence and human rhythm he imbues them with. "Boxing Gym" and his 2009 ballet troupe portrait "La danse" are driven by repetition and pursuit of form. In "City Hall" there are mesmerizing long takes of mattresses and barbecue grills being obliterated and compacted by a garbage truck's compressor and long spindly tree limbs are methodically pulled in and consumed by a restless wood shredder -- activities quite mundane and everyday, that in Wiseman's purview magically become hypnotic wonderments. Also too, Wiseman's longtime collaborator, cinematographer John Davey artfully finds Escher-esque motifs and reflections within reflections amid our familiar facades. His upward angled framings cut aesthetic portraits of old Scollay Square and the bland Saltonstall building in ways one might not have imagined possible. "City Hall" in the end, is a dutiful reflection of who we are, where we came from and a piquant insider look into the vast municipal neural net that keeps us humming as a community.

CURRITUCK — Challenger Kelly Williams Peters and incumbent Dwan Gibbs Craft have election to two seats on the Currituck Board of Education.
 With 11 of 11 precincts reporting, Peters defeated incumbent school board member Will Crodick to lay claim to the school board's Fruitville Township seat.
 Peters garnered 6,426 votes or 51.6 percent to Crodick's 5,803 votes or 46.6 percent.
 Peters defeated Crodick in early voting by 100 votes. She also carried nine of 11 precincts, losing only in Moyock and Coinjock.
 Craft had no opponent on the ballot but was being challenged for re-election by write-in candidate Mary Suman for the Moyock Township seat.
 Craft garnered 9,465 votes or 84.3 percent. Write-in candidates, which could include Suman, attracted 1,756 votes or 15.65 percent.
 Turnout in Currituck for Tuesday's election was 73.53 percent, as 16,054 votes were cast.

For those who have a mail-in ballot but have yet to mail it or turn it in, state election officials highly recommend that such voters drop the ballots off by hand instead of mailing it to ensure it reaches the bureau of elections in time and is counted.
 The only drop-off location in Cumberland County is at the county’s Bureau of Elections, 1601 Ritner Highway, Suite 200, Carlisle. The bureau will accept dropped off ballots until 8 p.m. Tuesday, when polls close across the county.
 Cumberland County Bureau of Elections Director Bethany Salzarulo said the county issued 60,075 mail-in ballots for the general election, compared to about 37,000 mail-in ballots for the June primary. As of this past Thursday, 46,961 mail-in ballots were received by the county. Of the ballots requested, 30,932 went to Democrats and 21,021 went to Republicans.
 What happens with the mail-in ballots after that has attracted state and national attention.
 Cumberland County opted to not pre-canvass the mail-in ballots, or work on opening and tallying the ballots, which could have started as early as 7 a.m. Tuesday. The county instead will start canvassing the mail-in ballots at 9 a.m. Wednesday.
 Salzarulo said that by doing it this way, election staff can focus on only in- person voting on Tuesday, and then they can turn their attention to the mail- in, absentee, provisional and military ballots.
 The 13-hour delay means the county may not have results as quickly as other counties in the state, but Salzarulo said that even if they started early on election night, the county would not complete results by midnight.
 The delay in counting the mail-in ballots had some county residents concerned given recent rhetoric and litigation over what ballots will be counted in Pennsylvania. The most recent U.S. Supreme Court decision was to not expedite an appeal by the GOP in Pennsylvania regarding the extension for receiving postmarked ballots through Friday, Nov. 6. If, at some point, the Supreme Court rules that such ballots should not have been counted, as the lawsuit stands now, the ruling would only affect ballots mailed by Nov. 3 but not received until Nov. 6. The ruling would not affect any mail-in ballot that was received by the county before 8 p.m. Nov. 3, whether it is handed in or received via mail.
