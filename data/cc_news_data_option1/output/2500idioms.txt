Oscar Barajas has been helping serve community members in the Tri-County with his Mexican style food dishes for over 20 years. Now more than ever Barajas thinks of the patrons at Mi Casa in Corbin as his friends and family.
 What started as one restaurant 23 years ago in Williamsburg has expanded to three restaurants across the Tri-County. Barajas said he never dreamed of a growing business but is forever thankful.
 Years ago Barajas started out as a "chip guy" for his brother-in-law and although he was always a hard worker, he said he never planned to own the business, much less expanding it to the now three restaurants. Mi Casa is going on its 23rd year in business. Mi Jalisco also in Corbin has been in operation for 10 years and the newest edition, a London location of Mi Casa, opened six months ago.

Liverpool, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 26th Jun, 2020 ) :Liverpool's coronation as English champions for the first time in 30 years is the culmination of a dramatic journey since Jurgen Klopp's appointment as manager in 2015.
 Klopp is the charismatic face of Liverpool's transformation from top-four contenders to Champions League winners and now Premier League champions.
 However, the Reds' success on the pitch has been made possible by plenty of shrewd work on signings and sales behind the scenes.
 Of the 18-man squad named by Klopp in his first match in charge less than five years ago, only James Milner, Adam Lallana and Divock Origi have featured this season, in peripheral roles.
 The construction of Liverpool's title-winning squad has been a steady process.
 In Klopp's first summer transfer window, Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum arrived to help secure a return to the Champions League.
 The next year they were joined by Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
 By January 2018, a long pursuit of Virgil van Dijk resulted in the Dutchman becoming the world's most expensive defender for ï¿½75 million ($93 million).
 Inspired by Salah's free-scoring form, the instant impact of Van Dijk and growing maturity of full-backs Robertson and academy graduate Trent Alexander- Arnold, Liverpool reached the Champions League final in 2018.
 Two howlers from Loris Karius against Real Madrid delayed a sixth European Cup win for a year, but what happened afterwards showed the club's ruthless desire to get back to winning major trophies.
 Karius has never played another game for Liverpool as another world record fee, this time for a goalkeeper, was splashed on Alisson Becker from Roma.
 Fabinho, Naby Keita and Xherdan Shaqiri were also recruited in 2018 in a spending spree of more than 160 million.
 "Maybe this season finally you demand they win," jibed then Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho.
 Win is what they have done relentlessly for two years.
 A mammoth total of 97 points was still not enough to win the title last season due to Manchester City's own stunning levels of consistency.
 However, the upgrades for the 2018/19 season were rewarded in silverware with a Champions League triumph. On the way to the trophy Liverpool thumped Barcelona 4-0 in the second leg of the semi-final, even without the injured Salah and Roberto Firmino.

Dublin, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 26th Jun, 2020 ) :A three- party coalition to rule Ireland is set to be approved or vetoed on Friday, four months after a fractious general election upended the political orthodoxy of the Republic.
 Results of intra-party polls among the Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green parties later on Friday will reveal whether an alliance deal has rank and file backing.
 If the coalition deal is sealed it will represent an historic compromise between old civil war rivals Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, longtime stalwarts of Ireland's political centre-right.
 However, if blocked the Republic faces another general election as it claws its way out of coronavirus lockdown, and a rerun of the February poll which saw republican party Sinn Fein surge into the mainstream.

I also called for the script on my phone as the hard copy would have been touched by multiple people," the "Pyar Ki Luka Chuppi" actress told IANS.

Jesse Schlotfeldt won his first feature at Skagit Speedway in epic fashion, throwing a kamikaze slidejob for the win on the final lap. Kelsey Carpenter had led every lap comfortably until lap 23 when Schlotfeldt narrowed his advantage down to three car lengths. With a big head of steam coming out of turn two on the final lap, Schlotfeldt dove low on Kelsey entering turn three and closed the entire distance between the two and then some by mid turn. Surprised to see Schlotfeldt make such a huge move, Carpenter tried to counter but ended up looping his car at the exit of turn four as Jesse streaked past for his first win. Eric Turner and Sean Johnson also took advantage of the mistake, driving into second and third at the line.

Muslim-majority Malaysia has long been a favoured destination for Rohingya seeking a better life after fleeing a 2017 military-led crackdown in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh.
 But Malaysia, which does not recognise refugee status, has recently turned away boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya, amid rising anger towards foreigners who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and taking up scarce state funds.
 "We can no longer take more as our resources and capacity are already stretched, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic," Muhyiddin said in teleconference with other leaders of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar.
 "Yet, Malaysia is unfairly expected to do more to accommodate incoming refugees."
 The treatment of Rohingya has been divisive for ASEAN, with its two Muslim- majority members - Malaysia and Indonesia - criticising Buddhist-majority Myanmar and expressing growing frustration with Rohingya arriving on boats operated by people smugglers.
 Myanmar denies abuses against members of the minority in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, but says the Rohingya are not citizens but illegal immigrants from South Asia.
 Rohingya have for years boarded boats between November and April, when the seas are calm, to get to Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
 Muhyiddin urged the UN refugee agency to speed up the resettlement of Rohingya in Malaysia to third countries. The agency says there are more than 100,000 Rohingya in Malaysia though rights groups say the number is higher.
 He also called for more efforts to combat the trafficking of Rohingya, who he said were increasingly at risk for exploitation, slavery and recruitment by militants.
 "ASEAN must do more to help Myanmar, and Myanmar must also do more to help itself for this crisis to be put behind us," he said.
 Dozens of Rohingya died and their bodies were thrown overboard from a boat that later landed on a Malaysian island this month with 269 people on board, authorities said.
 On Thursday, nearly 100 Rohingya were rescued by fishermen from a boat adrift off Indonesia.

ORLANDO -- Amid calls to change the Splash Mountain theme park ride over its ties to "Song of the South," the 1946 movie many view as racist, Disney officials said Thursday it was recasting the ride based on "The Princess and the Frog," a 2009 Disney film with an African American female lead.
   
 Changes to the ride will be made both at Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, the company said in a post.
   
 Disney said the changes had been in the works since last year, but the announcement comes as companies across the U.S. are renaming racially charged, decades-old brands amid worldwide protests for racial justice after the police custody death of George Floyd in Minnesota last month.
   
 "The new concept is inclusive -- one that all of our guests can connect with and be inspired by, and it speaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks each year," the Disney post said.
   
 Splash Mountain first opened as a log-flume ride at Disneyland in the late 1980s.
   
 The revamped ride will follow the contours of the animated movie, "The Princess and the Frog," in which actress Anika Noni Rose voices the role of a 1920s aspiring chef in New Orleans who kisses a prince that has been turned into a frog and becomes one herself.
   
 With racist stereotypes and Old South tropes, "Song of the South" is a mix of live action, cartoons and music featuring an old black plantation laborer named Uncle Remus who enchants a white city boy with fables of talking animals.
   
 Groups including the NAACP protested the film's initial release. The film isn't available to the millions of subscribers of the company's new Disney Plus streaming service, and it hasn't been released in theaters in decades.
   
 "Disney parks should be a home for all to enjoy regardless of race, age, whatever your background may be," said an online petition asking for the ride to be changed. "While the ride is considered a beloved classic, it's history and storyline are steeped in extremely problematic and stereotypical racist tropes from the 1946 film Song of the South."
   
 But Splash Mountain had its supporters. Another online petition asked that the ride remain in its current incarnation.
   
 "Many adults and children ride this attraction because it brings back childhood memories," the "Keep Splash Mountain" petition said. "Disney already took out the racist songs which was a good move on their part."

Temperatures as we start off the week will be right around the 90 degree mark with those temps only rising as we go through the week. Just as important as the actual air temperature will be the rising humidity across the ArkLaTex. This will make it feel significantly more miserable if you will be outside for a prolonged period of time. Our best chance for rain during the work week next week will come on Thursday will potential showers for the ArkLaTex.So get ready for more potential rain for the ArkLaTex along with a whole lot of humidity on the way as well.

FIFA's plan means world football's governing body will dip into its reserves to provide national federations with a number of grants and interest-free loans to cope with budget hits.
 FIFA had already provided the immediate release of all funds from its 'Forward' projects and given the green light for such grants to be used for COVID-19 relief plans -- with a minimum of 50% of released funds to be allocated to women's football.
 The third stage of the plans, unanimously backed by the FIFA Council on Thursday, allows for a 'universal solidarity grant' of $1 million dollars to all national associations with an additional $500,000 specifically for women's football.
 Each regional confederation will receive a grant of $2 million.
 FA's will be able to apply for loans, amounting to up to 35% of their audited, annual revenues up to a maximum of $5 million with confederations able to request up to $4 million.
 "Both grants and loans can be directed by member associations to the wider football community in their respective territories, including clubs, players, leagues, or others that have been affected by COVID," said FIFA president Gianni Infantino.
 Infantino added that there would be strict controls on the use of funds, audit requirements, as well as clear loan repayment conditions.
 Olli Rehn, the deputy chairman of the FIFA Governance Committee, who is Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, will head a committee set up to administer the funds.
 The council also backed changes to the calendar to support confederations' desires to extend international breaks to allow for fixture congestion and rearranged matches.
 Infantino said no decision has yet to be taken on the rescheduling of the new Club World Cup tournament which has been postponed from July 2021 due to the postponement of Euro 2020 and the Copa America.
 The council also gave the green light to a new pan-Arab tournament to be played in 2021 in Qatar as a 'test event' for the 2022 World Cup.
 The invitational competition will be contested by Arab nations from Africa and Asia and feature home-based players only.
 The tournament will be held in from 1-18 December 2021 and be run by Qatar's World Cup organising committee.
