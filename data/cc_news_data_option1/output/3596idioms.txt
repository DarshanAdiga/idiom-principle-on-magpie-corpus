 A pair of Swampscott commercial property owners has for the third time been mailed official outreach notices by the local building inspector for allegedly violating the town's blighted property bylaw.
 The dilapidated properties the town argues remain in violation include the old gas station at 182 Paradise Road - owned by Best Petroleum - as well as the old General Glover House Restaurant at 299 Salem St. - owned by the Sunbeam Development Limited Partnership (Sunbeam).
 "We have given each property until Sept. 15 to address a list of building deficiencies," said Swampscott Town Administrator Sean Fitzgerald during the Swampscott Board of Selectmen's Sept. 2 meeting.
 Swampscott Building Inspector Max Kasper mailed initial violation letters in the winter and spring months, but Fitzgerald said the enforcement process stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in mid-March. Fitzgerald added the new letters, mailed in late August and early September, relay verbatim what preceding ones did.
 "What's different now is we are actually done with the initial outreach for compliance," Fitzgerald told selectmen. "We're going to level fines if they are not brought into compliance."
 A first offense comes with a $100 fine, a second offense with a $200 fine and a third and successive offenses come with a $300 fine.
 "Each violation of this bylaw shall constitute a separate offense," reads Swampscott's blighted property bylaw. "Each day that any such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense."
 The two properties served as case studies when town officials persuaded 2019 Swampscott Town Meeting members to adopt a blighted properties bylaw.  It established the town's building inspector as the enforcement authority.
 "To date we have not seen activity at the property indicating an effort to work towards compliance," wrote Max Kasper to not only Best Petroleum but also Sunbeam. "As previously noted, the quantity and degree of degradation of these building[s] is severe."
 299 Salem St.
 The General Glover restaurant sits on a 2.4-acre property where Swampscott, Marblehead and Salem lines meet in Vinnin Square. Patriot Properties assessed the entire parcel at $2.78 million - with the three dilapidated buildings comprising a collective $169,300 assessment, the land $2.6 million.
 Kasper lists 32 issues and concerns, too many to publish in full, with the buildings on the property, arguing they meet the town's standards for a blighted property.
 "Major components of the roof and wall structures are deteriorated. Additionally, the property is inadequately secured as evidenced by the numerous broken windows, gaping holes in the envelope, and open doors," wrote Kasper in a Sept. 1 letter. "There is also debris and rubbish accumulated on the property in the vicinity of the structures that further evidences the neglect of the property."
 Marblehead and Swampscott applied for a Metropolitan Area Planning Council grant to conduct a planning evaluation and assessment of the site and determine what re-use options may exist.
 182 Paradise Road
 The old gas station sits on a .270-acre property near Swampscott Clark Elementary School. Patriot Properties assessed the entire parcel at a collective $409,500 with the building assessed at $169,300, the land $379,600.
 Kasper listed 14 issues and concerns with this property, from "damaged exterior conduit and loose hanging wires" and "broken windows to "gutters and downspouts full and compromised" and "evidence of rodent activity and access to building
 "The property is inadequately secured as evidenced by the broken windows and easily compromised door. There is also debris and rubbish accumulated on the property in the vicinity of the structure that further evidences the neglect of the property," wrote Kasper in an Aug. 28 letter. "It is clear to me that this property meets the standards for blighted structures."
 Selectman Peter Spellios said the town knows about a commercial parking arrangement between the property tenant or landlord and Family Doctors, LLC. The town permitted offsite parking to continue at 182 Paradise Road even though the parcel is not zoned for such a purpose.
 "The town expressed a willingness to entertain a bylaw change that would effectively allow a street commercial parking lot here," said Spellios. "But one of the main conditions was that the blight - essentially the building had to be removed and the block properly landscaped."
 Spellios pointed out change has yet to occur.
 "I hope that we can continue working and helping get a resolution that allows Family Doctors to use this," said Spellios, "but it can't be used in this condition."
 It's important to note: The blighted-properties bylaw includes due-process provisions that permit property owners to appeal the building inspector's decisions.
 The Swampscott Reporter tried multiple times to call and track down the property owners for comment. Leigh Blander contributed writing and reporting.

FORREST COUNTY, Miss. (WDAM) - Public schools have only been playing football for the last week but the changes can already be seen.Fans are wearing masks in the stands and there are fewer of them. With a 25% capacity limit, ticket sales are down.‚ÄúMany of our sports are impacted by these gates, so obviously with the 25% rule, that‚Äôs going to be a challenge for us,‚Äù said Petal School District Superintendent Dr. Matt Dillon.Dillon said the district doesn‚Äôt plan on cutting any extracurricular activities because of the change.‚ÄúWe know the importance of academics obviously is what drives us but also there‚Äôs so much value in extracurricular, whether it be the arts or athletics,‚Äù said Dillon.Dillon did say the loss in revenue will impact the district‚Äôs budget, and athletics will have to be tighter with their spending.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make sure our athletes and our students have what they need and our coaches and directors have what they need,‚Äù said Dillon.Dillon is still excited for this week‚Äôs home opener despite the restrictions.In the Forrest County School District, low turnout completely canceled football season.‚ÄúThe district always supplements any time there‚Äôs a need to with all our athletic programs if it doesn‚Äôt produce funds," said Superintendent Brian Freeman. "Yea, football is a big moneymaker. It does fund other programs as well.‚ÄùFreeman said the 25% capacity rule would limit the program‚Äôs chance to bring in money.‚ÄúWhen you take into account officials and security and things like that, it could‚Äôve been a break even or even a money loss part of the program,‚Äù said Freeman.Freeman is hopeful more students will sign up to play.Copyright 2020 WDAM.

San Diego‚Äôs controversial Smart Streetlight cameras will be shut off, drawing applause from social justice activists, but removing police access to a tool they say helps solve violent crimes.
 Mayor Kevin Faulconer on Wednesday ordered that the more than 3,000 cameras installed on streetlights throughout San Diego be turned off until the city crafts an ordinance to govern surveillance technology.
 Mayoral spokesman Gustavo Portela said Faulconer made the call ‚Äúfollowing clear feedback‚Äù from council members and community leaders, who pressed to get a surveillance ordinance in place before the City Council considers using such technology.
 The surprise announcement came days after the city floated a plan to hand over the camera management and access exclusively to police ‚Äî a plan that drew immediate pushback from corners of the community for its lack of public oversight. The city hit the brakes on that plan hours before Faulconer‚Äôs decision was announced ‚Äî also a surprise.

Legislation is heading to Gov. Tom Wolf‚Äôs desk that would let local public and private school officials make decisions about allowing interscholastic sports and other extracurricular activities this school year, including how many people can attend them.
 The state Senate on Wednesday passed House Bill 2787, sponsored by Rep. Mike Reese, R-Westmoreland County, by a vote of 39-11, that ensures local school officials have this power and not the governor or members of his administration. The bill passed the House last week by a vote of 155-47.
 Despite the bill‚Äôs bipartisan support in both chambers, Wolf, a Democrat, is opposed to it, according to his spokeswoman Lyndsay Kensinger. It is unclear at this point whether the governor will veto it or allow it to become law without his signature.
 Along with clarifying that schools can decide whether to hold sports during 2020-21, the measure also would allow local officials to set spectator limits provided they ensure social distancing is followed along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rules for youth sports.
 Last month, the governor recommended that no sports be held through the end of this year, which despite only being a recommendation led some schools to decide to cancel their fall sports season.
 Initially, the Wolf Administration said no spectators would be allowed to attend these events if they were held, but last week he released new guidance capping attendance at outdoor activities at 250 and up to 25 for indoor events. Included in those count are the athletes, coaches, officials and other game-day workers, which in some sports leaves no room for any spectators to attend.
 Senate Education Committee Chairman Wayne Langerholc, R-Cambria County, said those limits are arbitrary and fall short of accomplishing the goal of allowing spectators, particularly in certain sports where the number of participants, coaches and officials already exceed those limits.
 ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt allowed indoor to watch their children or grandchildren if they exceed 25 but they are allowed to funnel into a big box store and rub elbow for hours at a time," Langerholc said. ‚ÄúThere is no basis in the guidance that has given here and House Bill 2787 is the first step in acting accordingly.‚Äù
 Some Democratic senators argued that there are public health risks associated with these events. Besides that, school districts already have the authority to make decisions about holding sports.
 Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre County, agreed that is the case right now.
 ‚ÄúThe problem with that is what the governor giveth, the governor can taketh away. At any point in time, next minute, hour, next day, next week, the governor could change his guidance to an order," Corman said. "If we pass this bill and it is signed into law, it would remain in the hands of the school districts.‚Äù
 Furthermore, he said this bill allows school districts to decide to exceed the governor‚Äôs attendance limits if they think more spectators can safely be accommodated while adhering to social distancing and CDC guidelines.
 Sen. Tony Williams, D-Philadelphia, was among those who saw this legislation as another attempt by the Legislature to get around COVID-19 restrictions that the governor has imposed through the use of expanded powers granted him through his disaster declaration, which he renewed for another 90 days last week. He said the governor has done a good job in handling the response to the pandemic and why Pennsylvania wins high marks in that regard.
 Sen. Lisa Baker, R-Luzerne County, spoke of the studies that show students who participate in sports have academic success in the classroom.
 ‚ÄúLet them play. Let them play safely and responsibly and this legislation is an important step forward in ensuring our students can play and have access," she said.
 Deciding which spectators get to attend an event is the subject of a meeting set for tomorrow by Mid-Penn athletic directors, who expressed hope that Reese‚Äôs bill would become law to make those decisions easier.
 Reese said he offered the bill after hearing from parents who wanted to watch their children participate in fall sports and activities. In urging his House colleagues to support the legislation last week, Reese spoke of some of the consequences of not allowing students to participate in extra-curricular activities.
 ‚ÄúWhen students are denied the avenues to interact with their peers, with positive role models in a meaningful way, there‚Äôs a very negative impact," Reese said. "We see increases in depression. We see increases in drug use, overdoses and unfortunately, we see increases in suicides and attempted suicides.‚Äù

John Esler is the Founding Committee chair of EforAll's new Greater Worcester program. EforAll is dedicated to helping under-represented individuals successfully start their own businesses. EforAll works to foster and accelerate social and economic impact through inclusive entrepreneurship in the community.
 What is your connection to Central Mass.?
 I grew up and Albany, New York, came to the Boston area in 1996 to get my MBA at Babson, and have been a resident of Sutton for 22 years. The business I started in 2004, Esler Companies dba Renewal by Andersen Windows, is located in Northboro.
 Can you describe your career trajectory?
 I am a lifelong entrepreneur who believes doing the right thing, in the long run, is always the most profitable thing. As a youth with a paper route and caddying at a local golf course, I discovered an appetite for working for myself. Engaging others to work with me began during the summer months through my college years, selling souvenirs at Saratoga Springs horse racetrack in upstate New York. Other entrepreneurial ventures include owning Subway franchises and a Betterliving Sunroom dealership before establishing Esler Companies, Renewal by Andersen's largest national affiliate, in 2004. While leading Esler Companies, I focused attention on structuring the organization around its core value of love, and to be a business in service first to teammates, second to customers, and third to the community. I am especially proud of establishing the company's philanthropic arm, Window of Giving, which enables team members to give back to those in need within the communities where they live and do business. Upon retiring from Esler Companies, my wife, Jeanne, and I established the Esler Family Foundation to support local, national and global organizations that advance educational and wellness opportunities for youth. Philanthropic pursuits also include Babson College, Worcester State University, The Greater Worcester Community Foundation, Strong Minds and Young Life, and EforAll. My passion for entrepreneurship is now channeled to mentoring others as a member of the Center for Entrepreneurship Advisory Board at Worcester State University, as chair of an effort to bring EforAll to Worcester, and with business students at Babson College, where I earned my MBA.
 How did you become invested in EforAll?
 Lately, I have been focusing on how best to meet the post-COVID, racially aware needs of Worcester, when Barry Maloney induced me to EforAll just three months ago. I believe entrepreneurship is one of the bedrocks on which Worcester's future should be built, and I loved what EforAll was accomplishing so much that I committed to lead the effort to bring EforAll to Greater Worcester. EforAll, which stands for "Entrepreneurship for All," is a nonprofit organization based in Massachusetts that provides mentoring and support to budding entrepreneurs in under-resourced communities. EforAll is currently in seven Massachusetts cities, and I'm spearheading the effort to bring it to Worcester. Since inception 10 years ago, EforAll has a strong foundation of success, having trained entrepreneurs who have launched over 500 businesses, with over 70% in business with 75% women-owned, 56% people of color, 53% previously employed and 54% immigrant-owned. In 2020 EforAll will launch 270 new businesses.
 Briefly describe the organization's goals and objectives for Worcester
 Our goal is to provide individuals with the support system and tools to start a successful business or nonprofit -- leading to new jobs and a more vibrant local economy. EforAll is excited to partner with Worcester's strong network of community leaders, small business owners and neighbors to help under- represented individuals launch and grow businesses and nonprofits while fostering a community-wide spirit of entrepreneurship.
 Has your model proven effective in other cities?
 EforAll has already successfully replicated its model in eight locations across Massachusetts including Berkshire County, Cape Cod, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, South Coast and Roxbury. Through 2019, participants in our business accelerators have started 500 businesses, with an additional 130 entrepreneurs/business owners expected to go through the program in 2020. These businesses have created 720 local jobs to date, generated over $25 million in revenue in 2019, and raised nearly $35 million in capital. And EforAll is growing outside the state, with its first site in Colorado launching in 2019. It also recently expanded its Spanish-language program (EparaTodos) in communities with a high percentage of Spanish-speaking residents.
 What are some of the challenges COVID has posed for your rollout?
 EforAll has been able to move its Business Accelerator programs and local Pitch Contests online during COVID without any meaningful disruption to the entrepreneurs we serve. While it has been disappointing not to be able to meet the community leaders and organizations championing our cause here in Worcester in person, we remain on track with fundraising and launch timing despite the COVID restrictions.
 How can the community get involved?
 There are so many ways that individuals and organizations can get involved with EforAll Greater Worcester. We are currently looking to hire a local executive director and program manager, who will then begin actively recruiting for aspiring entrepreneurs and volunteers who may want to become a mentor, read applications, or teach a class. And as the Founding Committee chair, I would be remiss if I didn't say that while we are close to our fundraising goal, we are still interested in talking with any individuals or organizations that may want to make a financial contribution to help us launch EforAll Greater Worcester and its partner organization, a peer-to-peer program called Entrepreneurs Forever (eforever) in which small business owners and entrepreneurs meet monthly to share their business experiences and learn from one another under the guidance of a trained facilitator, helping to ensure long-term success.

Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, released the complaint, which he said contained ‚Äúgrave and disturbing‚Äù allegations. He said Murphy has been asked to give a deposition to Congress as part of an investigation into intelligence collection by DHS related to its response to protests in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.
 ‚ÄúWe will get to the bottom of this, expose any and all misconduct or corruption to the American people, and put a stop to the politicization of intelligence," the California Democrat said.
 DHS did not immediately respond to a request to comment about the complaint. It came the same day that acting Secretary Chad Wolf, who has been nominated by Trump to lead the agency, gave a ‚Äústate of the Homeland‚Äù speech in which he seemed to take care to equate the danger posed by various extremist groups.
 ‚ÄúDHS stands in absolute opposition to any form of violent extremism whether by white supremacist extremists or anarchist extremists,‚Äù Wolf said. ‚ÄúWe will continue our daily efforts to combat all forms of domestic terror.‚Äù
 Murphy said in his complaint that he was directed by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy DHS secretary, to modify a section of a report to make the threat posed by white supremacists less severe. He was told to play up the threat posed by left-wing groups to echo administration talking points around civil unrest following the protests over the killing of George Floyd.
 Murphy said he refused to alter the report because doing so would ‚Äúconstitute an abuse of authority and improper administration of an intelligence program." He was then taken off the project.
 He said he made a number of reports on Russian disinformation efforts to senior DHS and administration officials between March 2018 and March 2020. The details are classified and not included in the whistle-blower complaint.
 Then, in July, Wolf told him to hold back any reports on Russian election interference because they ‚Äúmade the president look bad,‚Äù according to the complaint. He also said Wolf told him to report on interference by China and Iran, instead of Russia, and those instructions came from White House national security adviser Robert O‚ÄôBrien. Murphy said he objected and was excluded from future meetings on the subject.
