Sam Allardyce criticised referee Mike Jones after missing what he deemed was "obviously a sending off" in Crystal Palace's 3-0 FA Cup defeat by Manchester City on Saturday.
 Jones drew the ire of the home fans with half an hour played when, having booked Yaya Toure just two minutes previously, he failed to produce a red after the former Ivory Coast international fouled Jordon Mutch.
 Toure then went on to play a key role in City's win, scoring their third with a fine free-kick late in the second half, leaving Allardyce frustrated with the officiating.
 Speaking in his post-match media conference, Allardyce said: "They should have been down to 10 men, yes, no doubt about it. Mutch had been booked for less, much less.
 "Obviously that was a sending off so the referee hasn't done his job. He hasn't been consistent."
 On the defeat itself, Allardyce speculated that losing and being knocked out of the cup could prove to be a blessing in disguise.
 "Only time will tell whether that defeat is a blessing or not," he added. "Every game you play you want to win it. We've lost that habit of winning.
 "Our game is okay in parts, we sometimes look quite good and then a mistake creeps in and the opposition punish us."

Football Federation Australia (FFA) chief executive David Gallop believes the planned expansion of the FIFA World Cup reflects the growth of football, especially in Asia.
 On Tuesday, FIFA voted unanimously to expand the World Cup to a 48-team tournament in 2026 following a meeting in Zurich.
 The new format will see the finals feature 16 groups of three countries before a 32-team knockout stage.
 FIFA - led by president Gianni Infantino - has come under fire but FFA has welcomed the change.
 "Australia is part of the Asian Football Confederation [AFC] where the most significant growth and investment is occurring and we expect this trend to continue over the coming years leading up to the World Cup expansion," Gallop said in a statement on Wednesday.
 "As the quality of Asian football continues to improve, AFC Member Associations will justifiably deserve greater representation at the FIFA World Cup.
 "In the meantime we will stay focused on achieving qualification for the Socceroos for next year's World Cup in Russia and we hope all Australians will get behind the team for their final qualifying matches."
 Asian champions Australia are third in the third round of AFC World Cup qualifying, a point adrift of Saudi Arabia and Japan after five matches in Group B.

Yaya Toure believes his Manchester City team-mate Raheem Sterling should have dived to ensure he was awarded a penalty against Tottenham.
 Saturday's thrilling 2-2 draw turned on the controversial moment, with Pep Guardiola fuming City did not receive a spot kick when Sterling was shoved by Kyle Walker with the score at 2-1.
 Spurs then rubbed salt into City's wounds as Son Heung-min netted Tottenham's second moments later, securing a share of the spoils.
 Walker admitted pushing the winger after the match, and Toure feels England international Sterling should have gone to ground to secure a penalty, even if it is hard to criticise him for not doing so.
 "If you have a bit of experience like me, you would maybe dive in that situation and that is maybe what you have to do," Toure told reporters.
 "He is too honest. He wants to be proper in these sort of games. If the lad is like that, you can't tell him he is wrong, if that is what he tries to do.
 "But when you see it, he can't miss from there, he was so close and after that Walker pushes him in the back.
 "Raz [Sterling] is always in front and the guy's pulled him, kicked him. It is unfair sometimes."
 Toure found referee Andre Marriner's mistake tough to take and thinks officials need more help after what he feels was a costly blunder.
 "If he looks again, the ref will see something was very wrong," said the midfielder.
 "If he looks at the highlights he is also going to feel something is unfair. We all do wrongs in life but this is difficult to take. It is two points going away.
 "For me, if video can be involved in football it is going to be brilliant.
 "Something has to be done. When you see the highlights on the game, I think you will see it was harsh.
 "Tottenham are a fantastic team but we deserved three points. I will go home and watch the highlights and I will probably be angry to lose two points like that."

West Ham have suggested they submitted "a bid of £20m" for a "a player from Scotland" amid speculation heavily linking them to Celtic striker Moussa Dembele.
 In an article entitled "The Insider" on the club's official website, an anonymous writer – whose views it is stated are "not necessarily the views of West Ham United" – claiming to have intimate knowledge of workings behind the scenes at London Stadium said the bid represents "a figure close to the club's all-time transfer record".
 Celtic told Omnisport on Thursday they had no knowledge of an official approach from West Ham and would offer no further comment.
 Dembele has proved a big hit with the runaway Scottish Premiership leaders, scoring 19 goals in 36 goals across all competitions after signing from Fulham last year.
 Five of those goals have arrived against bitter rivals Rangers and Parkhead boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted Celtic will not be persuaded to sell the 20-year-old Frenchman this month.
 At a news conference to preview Friday's FA Cup third-round tie at home to Manchester City, West Ham manager Slaven Bilic refused to discuss West Ham's alleged interest in Dembele.
 He did talk about his desire to sign veteran Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe and Brentford striker Scott Hogan – ventures that were apparently backed up by "The Insider".
 The piece claimed "an £8m bid was made for a player who currently plies his trade in the Championship and a £6m bid for a current Premier League player".

A worker has died at one of the 2022 World Cup venues in Qatar, tournament organisers have confirmed.
 The 40-year-old British man, who had been employed at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, passed away on Thursday.
 "The relevant authorities have been notified and the next of kin has been informed," the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said in a statement.
 "An immediate investigation into the cause of this fatality is underway and further details will be released in due course.
 "The Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy shares our deepest condolences with the family for their loss."
 It is the second confirmed death of an employee at one of the venues for the 2022 tournament in the last three months. An unnamed worker lost their life at the construction site of the new stadium Al Wakrah last October.
 The SCDL published a worker's welfare report last February that revealed that two Indian employees had died, though the incidents were unrelated to their work.
 A 52-year-old painter suffered cardiac arrest during a lunch break in the canteen of the Khalifa International Stadium site last October, and later passed away in hospital, according to the report.
 In January, a 55-year-old vehicle driver also died following a heart attack at his accommodation, while a further six people sustained injuries.
 The SCDL introduced new labour regulations in 2014 to safeguard the welfare of workers, after human rights groups had raised concerns about safety standards and living conditions.

Frequently, the annual budget process plays out with the School Board asking for more money than it is entitled to under a revenue-sharing agreement, and the County Board ultimately acquiescing in full or in part. This year, however, both because of the dire economic situation and because the budget process is being done largely on the fly, the school system may have to make do with roughly what Schwartz is proposing.
 On March 25, as the extent of the impact of the public-health crisis became apparent, School Board members directed Johnson to revise her budget downward in anticipation of reduced funding, but gave her no specific dollar-figure guidelines.
 School Board members plan to congregate, in person or “virtually,” for a budget work session on April 21, then hold a public hearing that evening before adopting their own budget proposal two days later. The final school budget will be enacted after the County Board adopts its own budget package and sets tax rates at the very end of April.
 The single-year impact of the economic cliff-dive on the county and school budgets could have been much more dire than it will be: More than half of county-government revenue (about $800 million) comes from real-estate taxes, which will not be significantly impacted – at least this year – by the vagaries of the economy. Schwartz is guesstimating that real-estate-tax assessments next year will be essentially unchanged from 2020, where previously the estimate had been for a 3-percent increase.
 Schwartz has acknowledged that, even after the budgets are adopted, more revisions may be needed.
 “Our expectations of [economic] recovery change from day to day,” he said.

WASHINGTON -- The coronavirus shock to the U.S. economy won't push the country into a damaging bout of deflation given the Federal Reserve's response and its power to do more, Fed vice chair Richard Clarida said on Monday.
 "Demand is impacted very adversely. On net it is disinflationary. I don't think it is deflationary. I think we have the tools to keep the economy out of deflation," Clarida said in an interview on Bloomberg television.
 The distinction is important. The Fed targets an inflation rate of 2%, and a period of disinflation -- where prices are still rising but at a slower pace -- means it is falling farther from that goal.
 But deflation refers to a more chronic problem where goods and services on average are actually getting cheaper, and has been associated with more dire economic episodes like the Great Depression. With prices falling, wages tend to follow, and households pull back on spending.
 Clarida noted that as concerns about the coronavirus intensified in February and March, analysts at first regarded it as a potential shock to the global supply chain because of its impact on Chinese manufacturing.
 That would likely cause prices to rise.
 Clarida said it has instead been a blow to demand which, while deep, is something he feels the Fed has the power to counter.
 "I always thought that if we got hit it would be a shock to aggregate demand, and that is what I think it is," Clarida said. "We are trying to offset that" with programs that include lending to smaller businesses and state governments.
 The Fed has also cut interest rates to near zero, and any talk of an increase is "a long way down the road," Clarida said. (Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Mark Potter and Hugh Lawson)

Yaya Toure is adamant he is not thinking about leaving Manchester City in the January transfer window.
 The 33-year-old seemed likely to depart earlier this season after falling out with head coach Pep Guardiola at the start of the 2016-17 campaign, but he has been reinstated to the first team in recent weeks after apologising for comments made by his agent.
 The former Ivory Coast international has still been linked with a January exit, but the midfielder - whose contract is due to expire in June - has dismissed suggestions he could leave Etihad Stadium in favour of a lucrative move to China.
 "No, I will not speak to other clubs during the transfer window," Toure was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.
 "My focus is on City. The future is there because for now the league is not finished. Me and the guys are always focused. That is the main point. I am a footballer, I belong to the field."
 Leaders Chelsea will go 10 points clear of third-placed City if they beat Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Wednesday, but Toure is refusing to throw in the towel just yet.
 "Chelsea are in a good way but we are going to fight until the end, make it difficult. At the moment, we are not in our best form but we have to be able to deliver," he added.
 "City have always been a team who fight to the end to win a trophy and at the moment we are not happy with the position in the league. We have to fight. We are starting the second half of the season and I think we will have to be almost perfect.
 "We will have to win all the games when we play the top four. The lads, the fans, the manager, we are all understanding that and we will try to do our best to get there."

a Linear Guide (Linear rolling guide) allows a type of linear motion that utilizes rolling balls. By using circulating balls between the rail and the block, a Linear Guide can achieve high precision linear motion. Compared to a traditional slide, the coefficient of friction for a Linear Guide is only 1/50th. Because of the restraint effect between the rails and the blocks, Linear Guides can take up loads in both the up/down and the left/right directions. With these features, Linear Guides can greatly enhance moving accuracy; it is especially true when accompanied with precision ballscrews.

Both on and off the soccer pitch, Patriot senior Victoria Haugen always has the mindset that she needs to be doing something to improve herself, to better today that she was the day before.
 Whether it is doing a weightlifting session at the gym, putting extra touches on the ball, or even sneaking in extra reading or a project for one of her high school classes, Haugen said isn’t the kind of person that likes to be idle.
 “I am a very active person. I always have to be doing something,” Haugen said.
 Perhaps it is that personality trait, along with tremendous soccer talent and acumen, that has propelled Haugen onto an international stage, giving the FC Virginia defender the opportunity to play in several tournaments overseas as a member of Team Norway at various age levels, beginning at 16U. Haugen, whose father Nils is a native Norwegian who immigrated here at age 21 and mother Micki was born in America, has dual citizenship.
 So when Norway began to show interest in Haugen as a 16-year-old while playing for FC Virginia, she jumped at the chance to compete for the country, even though there were several things that gave her pause at first.
 “I took a chance on Norway and it paid off. It’s been a great experience,” Haugen said. “At first, I was kind of nervous because I understand Norwegian better than I can speak it. I also hadn’t met the coaches in person before playing for them. But the team and the coaches and players turned out to be very welcoming. [We all] have been able to communicate fairly well.”
 Haugen had a chance last October to compete with the U.S. U-18 National team after being called into a training camp, but declined due to her commitment to Norway in the U19 UEFA Euro Qualifiers in Belfast, Nothern Ireland at the same time.
 Haugen said she has enjoyed the opportunity to travel the world because she enjoys traveling, although that aspect of competition hasn’t exactly been a foreign concept to her for most of her life.
 “My family and I took a trip to Norway to visit my dad’s family just about every summer, so it’s not like getting on a plane and flying somewhere was new,” Haugen said. “But getting to see other places in the world has been fun. It’s helped me develop as a person and has really helped me mature.”
 Haugen has played for Norway at tournaments in Sweden at 16-and-under, in Scotland at 17U, and in Northern Ireland and most recently in a friendly tournament in La Manga, Spain as part of the Norwegian 19U team. Unfortunately, the team’s planned participation in the UEFA Euro Eliteround in Prague, Czech Republic, where the Norwegian team was a heavy favorite to win according to Haugen’s father Nils, was cancelled because of worldwide concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “That was definitely a bummer. We had been preparing for that tournament for awhile and I think we had a good chance to win it,” Haugen said.

While rival video conferencing platforms haven’t faced the same level of criticism, both Microsoft and Google pointedly outlined what their respective Teams and Hangouts Meet offerings are doing to ensure meetings remain secure.


  In a recent blog post, Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, stressed all of the security features Microsoft already offers Team users, including how it encrypts data and handles enforcement requests – two areas where Zoom has come under fire.


  Spataro also noted that Microsoft doesn't use Teams data to serve ads or track participants' attention in meetings, something else Zoom has been criticised for.


  “Now more than ever, people need to know that their virtual conversations are private and secure,” Spataro wrote in an April 6 post. "At Microsoft, privacy and security are never an afterthought. It’s our commitment to you—not only during this challenging time, but always."


  Google took a similar approach, publishing its own blog post on April 7, summarising how Google Meet ensures meetings are secure.


  In the post, Karthik Lakshminarayanan, director of product management for G Suite security and controls, and Smita Hashim, director of product management for Google Meet, Voice & Calendar, talked up Google’s efforts to combat abuse, block hijacking attempts, limit the need for frequent security patches and the platform’s “secure-by-design infrastructure.”


  Though Zoom was not called out by name, the beleaguered platform has been criticised for problems in all of those areas in recent weeks.


  “I think the moves of Microsoft and Google are partly defensive to reassure their existing users (both enterprise and personal), but also part offensive – trying to use the controversy over Zoom to take market share from them,” said Paul McKay, senior analyst at Forrester. “Zoom has been caught out in this regard because they have made claims in the past about their security which have later proven to be demonstrably incorrect.


  "This has eroded a lot of trust in Zoom specifically, but I think their error here is not practicing good product security as part of development and making marketing claims which were not technically correct. They now have the next 90 days to prove if they meant what they said when their CEO responded to the issues last month."


  Jarad Carleton, global program leader in cyber security at Frost & Sullivan, argued that many of Zoom’s problems stem from the “move fast and break things” culture it adopted early on. That mentality was easier to overlook because of the easy, intuitive and highly reliable nature of the platform.


  But companies like Zoom that were not set up with a strong organisational security culture can later find themselves in a retroactive scramble to fix issues that should be dealt with from the outset.


  Carleton thinks the recent attention on Zoom’s shortcomings will benefit users in the long run, forcing other video conferencing platforms to review their own security measures to avoid similar criticism. He also said that publicly announcing security audits could help show users that collaboration vendors take security and privacy seriously.


  “Solutions such as Microsoft Teams, WebEx, Zoom and others are business tools, first and foremost,” Carleton said. “Any public criticism about security issues can impact subscription revenue, so the enhanced focus on security now as more people use them will only serve to enhance trust over the medium and long-term.”


  While Zoom’s security flaws may have given a black eye to a platform that is now pulling in more than 200 million daily users, McKay believes other platforms have quickly re-doubled their security commitments because “Zoom- bombing” and session hijacking could be a danger to them, too.


  “I think the impact of this is that it has forced all market participants to pay attention, not just those impacted,” McKay said. “If the industry doesn’t respond positively, then I think it could erode user trust as enterprises have now become fully reliant on these solutions to allow any modicum of productivity to be maintained in the current pandemic.”

Cuando finalmente se levante la cuarentena y poco a poco las personas vuelvan a salir a las calles, el mundo será un lugar muy distinto del que era cuando comenzó el aislamiento social obligatorio. Por un tiempo, no habrá visitas a restaurantes ni eventos masivos, los cines y teatros tendrán que reinventarse (la Asociación Nacional de Salas de Cine proyecta una paralización de 15 a 18 meses para la industria del entretenimiento), los viajes deberán esperar a que se abran las fronteras y muchísimas personas se habrán quedado sin trabajo. Como indicó el economista Miguel Jaramillo en una entrevista publicada la semana pasada en este Diario (antes de la ampliación de la cuarentena), solo por contratos temporales finalizados se perdería casi el 20% del empleo formal entre marzo y abril. Si a eso se suman los despidos por coronavirus (que la consultora Mercer estima que el 18% de empresas grandes en el país aplicará) y la ampliación del frenazo productivo, el número será mucho mayor. No es el caso, tampoco, que la rotación laboral permita saltar de un empleo a otro con facilidad. Un informe del Instituto Peruano de Economía da cuenta de que el mes pasado las oportunidades laborales publicadas en un portal especializado bajaron de 8.406 en la primera quincena (antes de la cuarentena) a 3.440 en la segunda (durante la cuarentena). Se podría argumentar que el aislamiento redujo considerablemente esos números. Y eso en parte es cierto. Sin embargo, la data no dice que las cosas vayan a mejorar en el futuro cercano. Según el Banco Central de Reserva, las expectativas empresariales a tres meses (medidas de manera ascendente con valores del 1 al 100) cayeron de 54,9 puntos en febrero a 28,5 en marzo. Lo mismo ocurrió con las expectativas económicas, que pasaron de 48,2 a 21,8 en el mismo período. Además, según estimó Apoyo Consultoría, tras consultar a 300 empresas que representan casi un tercio del PBI peruano, los niveles de confianza se han desplomado y para este año se anticipan caídas sin precedentes en la inversión privada y el empleo formal. Si un número por debajo de cero significa una reducción en el ritmo de ejecución, y a principios de año estos se encontraban en positivo o bordeando el cero, para los próximos seis meses el sondeo coloca un valor de -76 para inversión privada y -46 para contratación de personal. Y estos cálculos fueron realizados antes de que el presidente mandara a todos a sus casas por dos semanas más. Así las cosas, lo más prudente es cuidar el empleo formal porque pronto será un bien escaso. Pero esto no va solo del lado del trabajador sino también del empleador. Y en este sentido, la coyuntura complica bastante la situación. Cuarenta días sin producir hace imposible sostener los pagos de planillas, de deudas y a proveedores para la gran mayoría de empresas (según una encuesta de la Cámara de Comercio de Lima, en la capital apenas el 8% podría soportar más de 40 días de para sin incumplir en sus pagos). Por ello, y con mayor razón tras la segunda ampliación de la cuarentena, muchas empresas han empezado a considerar opciones como la suspensión perfecta de labores. Se trata de una licencia sin goce de haberes que se da únicamente en situaciones fortuitas o de fuerza mayor y por un tiempo determinado (y es razonable creer que una pandemia global que obliga a paralizar la producción por más de un mes cumple con estas condiciones). Es una salida difícil, pero en el mediano plazo busca precisamente cuidar los empleos formales. Es también una propuesta lógica desde hace unas semanas para muchos abogados laboralistas, pero no para los representantes del Ministerio de Trabajo y Promoción del Empleo (Mintra). Tras afirmar desde el inicio de la cuarentena que “durante el período de emergencia nacional no está habilitada” esta figura, la ministra de esta cartera, Sylvia Cáceres, finalmente confirmó el último jueves que procederá “si no existe otra fórmula que garantice la continuidad del contrato laboral”. ¿Cómo pretendía el ministerio sino que las empresas que tuvieron que dejar de producir intempestivamente siguieran pagando sus cuentas como si nada pasara? Los créditos del plan Reactiva Perú no serán suficientes para sectores que seguirán golpeados muchos meses después de que se levante la medida de aislamiento. El Gobierno se ha comprometido en más de una oportunidad a luchar contra la informalidad, pero las decisiones del Mintra en tiempos de pandemia estaban yendo en sentido contrario.

  The production of food is a necessary component of society. Feeding an ever- growing population is becoming more difficult because we are continuously using up the precious resources of our planet, and population growth continues to skyrocket across the globe.


  Despite skilled farmers attempting to replenish nutrients to our soils, the demand is currently too great, and the balance of food production is not proportional to the actual needs of humankind on the planet.


  What do I mean by this? The current diet of the average American is close to abominable. We rely on fast foods and our knowledge of good nutrition is sadly lacking. Even the foods we think are good for us are not necessarily so. Take dairy and meat products for example. Cow's milk was never designed for the human body to consume. It was designed, just as mother's milk is, to provide nutrients to offspring with crucial hormones for survival.


  America's meat intake is also off the charts. Americans can consume meat products at almost every meal. The average daily diet recommendation for protein is between 8 and 10%, but Americans consume upwards of 40 to 50% of meat protein daily. What is not known is that the food nutrients of these two items, dairy and meat proteins, can be obtained from whole food, plant-based products. So how is the production of meat and dairy farming affecting our environment?


  According to Bruce Monger, Ph.D. and senior research associate at Cornell University, the production of meat is the leading source of pollution for streams in the United States, and probably for many other countries around the world. Meat production requires growing a corn product, which is fertilized and harvested primarily for a feed product, not for human consumption. Corn is fertilized and the rains carry fertilizers into streams and rivers, settling down to lower levels creating excessive growth of phytoplankton. These bacteria draw the oxygen levels downward, which can create hypoxic levels in the water, possibly eliminating anything that needs to breathe, like fish or any other marine life. In other words, our rivers, streams and water sources are continually becoming contaminated.


  Production of meat also requires huge amounts of water consumption, which is becoming a scarce commodity. contrary of public belief. In 2013, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that more than half of the streams in the United States are unfit for aquatic life largely due to nutrient pollution. Those rivers eventually empty into our coastal environments. So, as we grow corn to feed beef cattle, poultry, pork and most of our egg production, which is produced in industrial meat factories or corporate farms, we are polluting our waters that will be needed for human consumption now and in the future. According to Dr. Monger, to grow a ton of beef requires 4 million gallons of water, whereas to grow sugar beets requires 52,000 gallons, vegetables 85,000 gallons, and starchy roots 100,000 gallons per ton. So meat, by far, utilizes much more water to produce.


  Finally, corporate meat farming contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization indicated that livestock production contributes 18% to overall greenhouse emissions. Manure decomposition generates a large amount of methane as well. When forests are cleared for grazing livestock, those burned trees go up in smoke and the carbon that was in that tree is now released as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.


  In a 2014 article in the Ecologist, an opinion piece by the nonprofit GRAIN said that small farmers can feed the world. How can this be so?


  First, small farmers produce foods the PEOPLE eat, not a secondary product like corn or soybeans used to make other products. Small farmers prioritize food production, tending to focus on local and national markets and their own families.


  What they produce doesn't often enter into trade statistics, but does reach those who need it the most -- the rural and urban poor.


  Secondly, small farmers produce food on just 24% of the world's farmland according to GRAIN in 2014. While corporate farming is eating up the lands of the small farmer, particularly since the disastrous trade war experiment by the United States government this past year, small farmers are actually feeding the world due to producing foods that are oriented to human consumption, not animal consumption.


  If ever there was a time to support and insist on small farming, it is now. In a lecture by Dr. Monger, he indicates that if we cannot stop some of the practices negatively affecting our planet, we are heading for our sixth extinction. The former extinctions known to man were different, because as species used up the resources of the planet in their local environment, they could move to another location on the planet to start over. In our current life cycle, we have no planet B.
