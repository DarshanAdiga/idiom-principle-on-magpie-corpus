2020 is finally here and that means we’re only a few months away from seeing the revamped S-Class.

"I think the Iranians are shocked now, the Russians, the Chinese, no one would believe Trump would do that," he said, adding that Iran, in the short run, was likely to retaliate against the U.S. or its allies, and possibly against Israel. But he said in the long run, the loss of Soleimani — who had also been on Israel's radar for some time — would weaken Iran's capabilities across the region.

"AELP totally rejects his claim that the new level 2 standards in England fall short of the ILO definition of a 'proper apprenticeship' and the caricatures used bear no resemblance to the reality of what is actually being learnt by the apprentice.  Level 2 apprenticeship starts have slumped by a half since the levy started and if the Prime Minister is serious about doing more for the Midlands and the North, the reforms to the levy must reverse this damaging decline. These apprenticeships are essential for sectors such as construction and social care which will help galvanise the left-behind regions."

For the first time since 1997, the San Francisco 49ers are the top seed in the NFC playoffs, a stunning turnaround for a team that owned the second overall pick in the NFL draft just nine months ago.
 After four straight losing campaigns, including only 10 wins in coach Kyle Shanahan's first two seasons, the 49ers went from 4-12 to 13-3 this season.
 They emerged as the top team in the NFC thanks a big-play offense and a vastly improved defense sparked by Nick Bosa, whom they chose with that No. 2 draft pick.
 They earned the top seed with a thrilling finale at Seattle when rookie linebacker Dre Greenlaw made a stop inches from the goal line, earning his team a week off and up to two home games in the 49ers' quest to reach the Super Bowl for the first time in seven years.
