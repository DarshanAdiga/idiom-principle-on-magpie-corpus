I’m going to pitch for energy management as the first thing. Why? well first off it’s pretty much on everyone’s agenda, secondly UK plc really hasn’t done demand or consumption management well. Boards are all over tariff but few have really grasped the nettle of behaviour change from managing consumption down (and for a free ride carbon) as a core KPI measured corporate goal and finally, ‘fess up time, I have skin in the game, our company Optimal Monitoring has developed EMMA AI, what we believe is the first and best AI enabled energy management platform that more or less gets rid of all of the old arguments why demand management is important but not a priority.

But the city was overwhelmed by tens of thousands of people upset over what they saw as the inequities of capitalism and the exploitation of workers. Some black-clad anarchists broke windows and vandalized stores, hundreds of people were arrested and the then-mayor declared a downtown curfew to quell the unrest.In the 20 years since the WTO protests, Seattle has seen explosive growth, with Amazon adding tens of thousands of workers near downtown and other tech behemoths expanding operations.That growth has led to soaring housing costs and an economic divide that Berger said are underlying the current demonstrations."The issues of social justice and equity have increased because of this enormous disparity," he said.And being one of America's youngest cities allows people to use it as sort of a blank slate, Berger said, and encourages people to come who want to make big changes — whether in business, innovation or social areas.The city is also notoriously difficult to govern. It's rare for mayors to be reelected as they often try to satisfy the diverse demands of a booming business sector, an active labor community and a strident social justice movement.Its latest protest epicenter, also known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest area, has been peaceful so far, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday. She wants officers to return to the precinct without creating "something that devolves into a force situation.""We're really trying to take a methodical, practical approach to reach a resolution where everyone gets out of here safely," she said.Best expects the protests around the country to mark a historical turning point. "We are going to move in a different direction and policing will never be the same as it was before."On Capitol Hill, protester Mark Henry Jr. of Black Lives Matter said the current movement is broad and focused on change. But he said it incorporates many points of view."Seattle is a very diverse community, it would take me a long time to represent our community," he said.The call for police reform is re-ignited after a fatal shooting of a man over the weekend.___Associated Press photographer Ted Warren contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

On June 20, the Save A Lot will close. And for the time being, there is nothing to replace it.
 The store’s closure will leave a sprawling food desert in one of the city’s most vulnerable neighborhoods, an area northeast of downtown that is home to approximately half the city’s public housing.

Save A Lot, whose parent company is Moran Foods LLC, has been owned by its lenders, including JP Morgan, since it got out from under a heavy debt load of about $500 million earlier this year. The grocer had struggled in recent years, with declining same-store sales in fiscal 2018 and 2019, according to a report from credit-rating agency Moody’s Investor Service.
 Jared Chalk, interim director of the city’s economic development agency, said the city has been working with the property’s owner to pursue a grocery store to potentially fill the space Save A Lot is leaving. “We recognize the community needs for a grocery store in many areas of our city and the surrounding region,” he said.
 In the meantime, the city of Norfolk’s efforts to find a solution to the food desert in St. Paul’s were derailed by the COVID-19 crisis, said Councilwoman Angelia Williams Graves.
 “We started working with staff and some community partners when we started hearing they would close, late last year or early this year,” Graves said.
 With the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, and the mass unemployment that followed, she said the city had to turn its attention to the broader problem of food insecurity in Norfolk.
 But now, she said, the city is again focused on helping the St. Paul’s neighborhood. Less than a week remains before the store closes.
 “We are pivoting back to fill the void,” Graves said. One of the challenges, she said, has been getting U.S. Department of Agriculture approval to allow Virginia residents to use their food stamp benefits to order groceries online.
 Ordering groceries online, though, often comes with prohibitive fees. And community activists and residents worry that more comprehensive solutions might arrive too late.
 “To me it’s insult to injury, time after time in that community,” said Bev Sell, director of Feast Virginia, a nonprofit that works with food-insecure people in St Paul’s and other Norfolk neighborhoods. “We’re leaving the poorest of the poor to fend for themselves. And I would like to think we can do better.”
 Sell said she had spoken to city leaders about Save A Lot’s closure in January, before the COVID pandemic. The ideas she’d heard at the time involved expanding bus service to Harris Teeter and Walmart.
 “Nobody’s talking about that now,” she said, noting that the coronavirus pandemic makes bus transit a much more dangerous option.
 “What the food situation (in St. Paul’s) has been and continues to be is a reliance on the food bank,” Sell said. “We have to get some relief here.”
 The store’s closure “has the potential to be a devastating loss for our neighbors in St. Paul’s, a largely African American community already experiencing tremendous challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Ruth Jones Nichols, president and CEO of the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore.
 She said the Foodbank was committed to collaborating with partners and stakeholders to respond in a way that would “address the causes and consequences of hunger, including racial disparities in food insecurity rates disproportionately impacting African Americans and people of color. We have an obligation to do something meaningful at this moment, particularly since this community is in our very own backyard.”
 Sell had ideas of her own, from Amazon mobile delivery to food hubs bringing local farm produce into communities, or city planning that provides for grocery stores in walking neighborhoods rather than in places where people drive.
 “I have some thoughts,” she said, “but no funding.”
 Pledger said whatever solution is proposed, he’d want to make sure his community has some input. He works as a personal trainer, and said it’s important that the community gain access to nutritious food in a sustainable way.
 As it stands, he said, when the Save A Lot closes, the most accessible food options for people in his neighborhood will be fast food and mini-marts. And poor nutrition, he said, is especially dangerous during a pandemic.
 “Food insecurity is no laughing matter when you have viruses killing people,” he said. “A healthy diet could help stop that from being as lethal. That’s not a joke.”
