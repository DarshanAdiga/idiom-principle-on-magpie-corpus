Some outlandish theories followed his parting with the Easter Road club, because it allowed him to be free and available to assume the Celtic reins from Rodgers in what seemed a matter of hours. Some miffed Hibs fans claimed he deliberately engineered an exit because he knew that Rodgers wasn’t long for the world of Scottish football.
 “Oh yeah, me, Brendan and Claude Puel [sacked by Leicester] all got together to say ‘you leave there, and I’ll go in there’… As if that is going to work. A good conspiracy but unfortunately not true.”
 When Lennon unexpectedly found himself a manager at rest, he said the period would allow him to recharge his batteries. Within weeks, he was plunged into a frenetic environment as he was installed as the interim manager that daren’t fail to guide Celtic to a treble treble.
 His success in delivering that unprecedented feat allowed him to take charge permanently for a season in which the pursuit of a ninth-straight title has afforded him precious little downtime. Starting with last Saturday’s Scottish Cup win at Partick Thistle, with which Celtic returned after the break, they potentially face a humongous 19 games in little over nine weeks.

The leader of the US agency that says it applies a “new philosophy” to development aid was in Nairobi as part of an assessment to determine areas of need and funding structure, a process he said could take several months to be approved.
 Last November, Kenya and Mozambique were prequalified for programmes targeting the poor as well as reforms in key departments. Further assessments based on indicators by the World Bank will determine when the money will be made available and who the recipients will be.
 Kenya was qualified for the MCC Threshold, which means that once assessors approve of its progress on good governance indicators, Nairobi could access as much as $30 million (Sh3 billion) to run a three-year programme. According to MCC, the selection of Kenya for the programme is part of the US government’s efforts to reform institutions long clogged up with inefficiency.
 If approved, the funding for Kenya from MCC could be the first in nearly a decade. The country routinely failed on certain indicators of “ruling justly”. Kenya received $12.7 million (Sh1.27 billion) from MCC between 2007 and 2010 — during the Mwai Kibaki presidency.
 According to a programme profile provided to the _Sunday Nation,_ the money went to changing procedures at the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency, the principal State organisation charged with supplying drugs to public hospitals, to reduce corruption in procurement and stock taking. After the programme ended, however, MCC indicated the government had slackened in the criteria and didn’t approve any further programmes until now.
 “We are going to go through a process of several months of diagnostics and design to determine specifically how it is going to look like. There will undoubtedly be institutional and policy reform focus that is going to target corruption,” he told the Sunday Nation.
 Since 2010, however, Kenya has introduced county governments which means that the assessment will now involve both levels of government. Mr Cairncross indicated the lessons learnt in the first programme will drive the new way of working this time round.
 “It is an iterative process for us to learn to do things better.
 “One of the things that we learn is to bring on board real private sector engagement because without that you are not going to have a sort of real economy that is going to benefit the entire population.”
 The full interview touching on other issues is available in the East African.

To better support the integration of technology in the education system, the OECS Commission partnered with UNICEF to launch the GIGA/Project Initiative that will connect every school to fast and reliable internet, and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. The Commission is partnering with Ministries of Education towards improving student learning outcomes through the implementation of the OECS/USAID Early Learners Programme. This early grade reading intervention has impacted over 17,000 learners in reading programmes at the primary level and 750 classrooms in the OECS through 173,114 teaching and learning resources. In this project and other initiatives led by the OECS Commission, 97 schools benefited from grants valued at over 500,000 Eastern Caribbean Dollars. These grants have given rise to innovative ideas such as reading instruction through agricultural experiences and virtual reality to teach Science.      Despite the accomplishments, the OECS Commission acknowledges the need for key transformations in the education system to develop the ideal OECS, and by extension, 'Caribbean citizen'. Continued collaboration with educators across the OECS has created anticipation of some key changes to come, with a view to creating the best possible environment so that every learner succeeds. The Commission invites all citizens to celebrate life by celebrating education. Congratulations to all.

“The goal is to draw new visitors from outside our immediate area," he added. "As more people discover the wonders that our valley holds, the more the area will develop. Of course, with development comes economic growth, jobs and opportunities to enjoy a better quality of life for all our citizens.”
 Stein recently noted that the Lake County Visitors Bureau, rebranded as Remarkable Lake County, OH, plans to work collaboratively with the Ashtabula County Visitors Bureau to increase economic impact through a unified, regional tourism brand.
 This work will build upon the 2016 Grand River Branding Initiative, a private- public partnership with Lake and Ashtabula counties, to develop and help brand a shared identity for the Grand River Valley based on natural, social and economic development variables that exist in the region.
 Hamercheck said today's tourists are not concerned with political boundaries when choosing where to visit and spend their time and money.
 "Tourism and economic development go hand in hand,” he added. “Our goal is to increase activity in the region as a whole. This collaboration between Lake and Ashtabula counties is a model of how to leverage public and private resources for the continued growth of the Grand River Valley.”
 Stretching from Madison Township along the Grand River corridor through western Ashtabula County, the Grand River Valley is home to a plethora of wineries, distilleries, micro-brewers and fine dining opportunities. These destinations compliment the growing number of hotels, bed and breakfasts and cottages developing in the region.
 "Our commercial winery businesses are a critical part of the Lake County economy,” Cirino said. “We are pleased to support their efforts to bring more visitors to our county to appreciate the many fine establishments. This is true economic development.”

But in 1998 she rented the video and watched the movie again while recovering from a cold.
 “Halfway through,” she recalled in the 2002 interview with The Times, “I literally said: ‘Yes, this is it. I found it.’”
 She had not yet met Waters. By the time she did, she had acquired the rights and had sent him the first few songs for the musical, by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. When they finally did meet, Waters said in a phone interview, she promised him that she would make sure that the musical, about a chubby Baltimore teenager who wins a spot on a local television dance show, stayed true to his voice and vision.
 “She stuck to her word,” he said, “and we were lucky. It went right, right from the beginning. She honored everything about the original intentions of the movie.”
 The musical version of the Waters movie, with a book by Mark O’Donnell, opened on Broadway on Aug. 15, 2002, and ran for almost 6 1/2 years, a total of 2,642 performances. It won eight Tony Awards, including best musical.
 Lion’s other Broadway producing credits included the August Wilson plays “Seven Guitars” (1996) and “Radio Golf” (2007), as well as “Elaine Stritch at Liberty” (2002), “Caroline, or Change” (2004), “The Wedding Singer” (2006) and “Catch Me if You Can” (2011).
 Lion was an early supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential candidacy. In 2009 he named her to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.
 In addition to her son, she is survived by two grandchildren.
 In a 1997 interview with The Associated Press, Lion described what drew her to producing despite the long odds of making money.
 “There is something that is very compelling about the live theater,” she said. “It’s a family. You create this very warm community within the production. And, of course, you have the satisfaction of actually making something that may last.”
 Kushner commended both her nuts-and-bolts knowledge and her passion.
 “She was one of those people who really knows how to get things done,” he said. “A fantastic practical mind married to a great love.”

In the past, U.S. coaches have tried to manage Lloyd, keeping her on edge and building up that chip on her shoulder. And it worked: Lloyd is a two-time FIFA world player of the year as well as a two-time World Cup and Olympic champion. Mia Hamm is the only other player, male or female, who can say that.
 But Vlatko Andonovski, who replaced Jill Ellis as coach last October, said he plans to let Carli be Carli.
 “Carli plays well when she’s comfortable and uncomfortable. We’ve see her in lots of different stages and we’ve seen her score goals in every stage,” he said.
 Andonovski is part of the reason Lloyd is preparing for an Olympic tournament that won’t begin until six days after her 38th birthday. The timetable Lloyd and James Galanis, the personal coach she refers to as her guru, originally mapped out called for her to retire after the last Olympics. But when Lloyd scored a hat trick in the 2015 World Cup final and won consecutive player of the year awards, they extended that through last summer’s World Cup.
 Anything beyond that would depend on who the coach was. And when Andonovski, who coached Kansas City to two NWSL titles, was named as Ellis’ replacement, any talk of retirement was put away.
 “I am honestly not thinking past Tokyo,” she said. “I am living in the moment and enjoying it one day at a time. The appointment of Vlatko has given me an extra injection of confidence. I feel energized and enjoying the new approach.”

 PLAINVILLE -- The Thomas More Prep-Marian boys basketball team held off an upset bid from Hill City, escaping with a 49-45 over the Ringnecks in Friday night's Mid-Continent League Tournament semifinal at Plainville High School.
 After knocking off No. 2-seeded Plainville in the first round, the Ringnecks look poised for another upset, taking a lead into the fourth quarter.
 A 3-pointer from Jackson Schulte put the Monarchs in front in the fourth frame and TMP was able to hold off Hill City late.
 Schulte and Carson Jacobs each scored 15 to lead TMP.
 The Monarchs will meet Phillipsburg in the championship game at Plainville Cardinal Gym on Saturday night. Check hdnews.net and Tuesday's print edition for a recap.
 After upending top-seeded Hoxie in the first round, Phillipsburg took down No. 5-seeded Ellis 45-41 on Friday.
 On the girls side, Trego was set to meet Phillipsburg in the final Saturday night in Cardinal Gym.
 Trego rolled to a 47-18 semifinal win over Smith Center while Phillipsburg outlasted Hoxie 51-45 in overtime.
 The TMP grils fell 47-32 to Norton in the seventh-place game on Saturday.

“She is wired to win. A player that thrives in pressure, invites challenging situations and rolls the sleeves up and [is] ready to fight toe to toe until the end. That’s who Carli has become and that is why she is different.”
 Which brings us to a third thing you should know about Lloyd: She may be the best big-game player in soccer history. For sure she’s the only player, male or female, to score the deciding goal in two Olympic finals, winning gold for the U.S. in 2008 and 2012. And she’s also the only player of either gender with a hat trick in a regulation-length World Cup final.
 That’s a resume she can add to this summer — and beyond, depending on how long she decides to keep playing. After that, she said, it will be up to someone else to write the final chapter of her career.
 “I’m not sure how I will be remembered. I haven’t really sat back to think about that,” she said. “Since Day 1, I have gone to work and emptied the tank every single day. In professional sports you can’t live in the past. You must always keep pushing on to be better.
 “In our case it has always been a cycle of preparing for a World Cup or an Olympics, so reflecting on what I have done has never been something I [did]. How I will be remembered will be up to those that have watched me play. They will determine how good I really was.”

As he closed his 25 minutes of remarks, Buttigieg sought to use the disruptions at the fundraiser to make a broader point about the need for the Democratic Party to unite as one to defeat Republican President Donald Trump in November. Throughout the campaign, Buttigieg has pitched himself as representing a new generation of leadership and as the candidate best positioned to unite what he described Saturday as “Democrats, independents and a striking number of what I like to call future former Republicans.”
 “It’s going to be messy. We are talking about the most vulnerable moment our republic has faced in our lifetimes, but I am also still convinced — more convinced after a year of campaigning — that there is a powerful American majority that wants the same things,” Buttigieg said. “At the end of the day, we’re going to have one nominee. The 25 people who didn’t get to be the nominee — and their supporters — are going to have to come together around the one who does, because we know what we’re up against in this country, and it is not each other.”
 Then, the protester tried to interrupt again as Buttigieg finished his close. The crowd of more than 300 erupted into more than two minutes of roaring applause, drowning out both the demonstrator and the candidate.
