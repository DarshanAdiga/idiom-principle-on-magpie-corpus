The New York City Council has passed a sweeping package of police reform bills, some of which have been in the works since the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in 2014. The package includes requirements for officer badge numbers to be visible, an official ban on choke holds or any other maneuver that restricts blood or air flow, and a bill requiring oversight of the New York City Police Department's surveillance technology. It also creates a penalty system for police officers with disciplinary issues, and sanctifies the right to record police interactions. In Washington, things aren't progressing so quickly. Senate Democrats are trying to decide whether to block a Republican police reform bill they believe is too weak. If they don't block it, they could miss an opportunity to change the bill to their liking. Meanwhile, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has promised a thorough investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a black EMT who was shot by police in her home in March. Some believe her case has gone under the radar in the rapidly evolving push for police accountability.

"Me and Mahi bhai had planned to bowl him wide of off stump. I thought he will come down the track and that is why I threw the ball much wider and got the wicket," Chahal explained Maxwell's dismissal from the third ODI of that series.
 Chahal also said that, Maxwell had opted for an attacking approach against him from the word go.
 "He was impatient in that series and used to attack me as soon as I came into bowl. I had a chat with Mahi bhai on how to tackle this. He replied we'll mix it up and won't show him the wide delivery. So that when I bowl the ball outside off stump, it should be a wicket-taking delivery," Chahal recalled MS Dhoni's words.
 Chahal removed Maxwell thrice in the 50-over format and once in the second T20I on that tour.
 In that series, India won the ODIs 4-1 while the T20I series ended at 1-1 after the final game was washed out without a ball being bowled.

Las empresas no eran operativas, sino que tenían como única finalidad ser titulares de inmuebles sin ejercer actividad alguna.Así se determinó que las operaciones de transferencias de inmuebles se suman a la creación de las sociedades, con la única finalidad de impedir fraudulentamente el cobro de sus deudas.A través de este mecanismo, Giordano utilizaba la cadena de peluquerías para acumular deudas laborales, comerciales, pero fundamentalmente tributarias y previsionales.

“Thing that ticks me off about that, what we were trying to do was remain out of the spotlight and it got turned upside down,” Heyward said Thursday. “To know that we were looked at as leaving one of our brothers out and leaving Al out to dry (hurts).”
 Heyward isn’t concerned about the Steelers making that mistake again as they prepare for a season unlike any other. The wave of high-profile nationwide protests in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police office has professional athletes once again trying to piece together how to use their platform to bring about change.
 While Heyward, a nine-year veteran and longtime defensive captain, stressed everyone has a voice in the locker room, he expects any public display by the team on the field to be one of togetherness.
 “I think we want to stay united in what we do and what we want to accomplish,” Heyward said. “Coach (Mike Tomlin) has always told me if we win the Super Bowl, that’s not enough in the city of Pittsburgh. We want to leave lasting change among the community as well. For us, we’re going to have those opportunities to branch out and be individuals and affect our community (off the field).”
 Heyward is confident the climate in 2020 is more open to honest dialogue compared to 2017, when Kaepernick’s taking a knee to call attention to police brutality turned into a referendum on whether it’s appropriate to make that kind of stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
 “It was harder (in 2017) because I felt like ... no one really paid to the issues Colin was talking about at the time and they were mostly concerned with what he was doing rather than his message,” Heyward said. “I think this time around you see the evidence and you see what he was talking about. It’s not like he was blowing up smoke. These are real issues that effect our communities and this is a chance for a lot of guys to speak up. We all have backgrounds and we’ve all seen these tragedies happen. They’ve got to stop.”
 The 31-year-old Heyward, a married father of three whose wife is white, added “these issues hit home way more because my family is going to have to deal with it for the rest of their lives.”

 And as the number of cases increases in other states, such as Florida -- which saw an increase of more than 3,000 cases on Thursday, June 18 -- political officials often say it's because there is more testing, noted Cuomo.

It was July 13, 2011 and I was in my Cessna 150 N3606J over Tennessee, clawing my way up to 9,500 feet. I was racing the rising layer of broken clouds, searching for smooth air.
 Flying below the broken clouds in a light single-engine aircraft like a Cessna 150 can be an adventure, especially on a hot July day. The air is very turbulent under the clouds as the air that is in the clear heats up and the air under the clouds is cooler. So, the hot air rises, cool air falls and you get air currents tossing you around as you move from sunlight to shadow under the broken clouds.
 For short periods, you can deal with it, but this was a two-day journey from Sebring to Madison, Wisconsin and required two long flying days to get there. The turbulence was so bad, at times it would pop open the right-side door. It would get my attention, but the airflow kept the door slightly ajar, so I just had to lean over and slam it shut again. Clear smooth air was the place to be, I just had to race the rising clouds to get above them. As the day went on, the clouds went higher. I found that around 3 p.m. it was time to find a place to land and call it a day. That was Tullahoma, Tennessee ... the half way point of my trip.
 So, what is the best method to take a long cross-country trip in the summer in a light plane? Start at the break of dawn and get an early start. The air is cool and calm since the sun has not yet heated the air. With skies that are likely to be clear, you can put some miles behind you before it gets warm. There should be a placard on the panel of a Cessna 150 stating “Flight after 12 Noon in the summer is not recommended.” There are many things that need to be considered to have a safe and enjoyable flight, but the one thing above all others that will affect a flight is the weather.

Heyward called for more resources for law enforcement officers and having a national database that can track complaints against officers.
 “If you have a prior complaint, that needs to be filed,” Heyward said. “There’s no reason you should be right back on the street. There should be no reason why the color of my skin or the color of my child’s skin or the color of my friend’s skin should threaten you.”
 While Heyward, who said he is in contact with his teammates every day, is confident social progress can be made — pointing to the Steelers’ decision to close their offices on Friday in honor of Juneteenth — he’s a little less certain about how the NFL moves forward amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He is entering the final year of his contract and though he wants to remain in Pittsburgh there hasn’t been much movement when it comes to a possible extension.
 “If I have to go into this year thinking it should be my last year, so be it,” Heyward said.
 Either way, 2020 feels like a last ride of sorts. Several younger players — namely linebacker T.J. Watt and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster — will be in the market for raises soon. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is playing on a rebuilt right elbow at age 38. For a team that’s missed the playoffs each of the last two seasons, Heyward has become acutely aware of a window potentially closing.
 “We know this team is not going to be the same next year,” he said. “I stress that a lot. ... We’ve got a great group of guys but some guys have outplayed their contracts and have to move on to greater pastures. That’s just how the game is ... I want everybody to get paid as much as they can ... whatever this last hurrah is we’ve got to be ready for it.”
 What that last hurrah looks like remains to be seen. The NFL and the NFL Players Association are still ironing out the details on how teams can safely get back to business. Heyward, an asthmatic, admits he’s still not sure how it’s going to work.
 “I know the NFLPA and the NFL have been working on this for a while,” Heyward said. “There’s so many different parts that have to be clear before me and my family feel comfortable about me playing.”
 The Steelers are scheduled to play in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton in early August. Heyward doesn’t see it happening.
 “The Hall of Fame Game is probably out,” he said. “We talk so much about safety and how, why would we want to expose two teams to an extra game a week early?”

The recent Supreme Court order that ruled in favour of DoT on its interpretation of AGR asking the industry to pay dues as high as Rs 1.47 lakh cr with VIL to pay an estimated over Rs 53,000 crore which could deal the final knockout blow to the already battered telco. The company having clocked consecutive losses in all quarters since its merger announcement in 2017 reported the highest ever corporate loss in the country at Rs 50,922 cr in Q2 of the current financial year which is over 10 times higher than that of the previous quarter. The mammoth amount came as a result of making room for AGR provisioning of Rs 25,680 cr in relation to the additional statutory dues following the apex court ‘s order.
 Its rival Airtel too listed massive net losses of Rs 23,045 cr in the same quarter- highest ever during its entire tenure on the back of provisioning for its dues in line with Supreme Court’s order. It made an overall provisioning of Rs28,450 crore.Mukesh Ambani-led Jio, which stands better than the incumbents, posted net profits of Rs 990 cr in the September quarter.

Skipper Jack Grealish admits Aston Villa’s Premier League return felt like a friendly as they prepare to welcome Chelsea. Villa host the Blues on Sunday, with games behind-closed-doors for the rest of the season amid the coronavirus pandemic.Villa restarted the Premier League on Wednesday, drawing 0-0 with Sheffield United and missing the chance to escape the Premier League drop zone.They earned a point after goal line technology failed when goalkeeper Orjan Nyland carried Oliver Norwood&rsquo;s free-kick over the line but referee Michael Oliver&rsquo;s watch did not register the goal.But Grealish, who has been charged with driving without due care and attention and failing to stop at a scene of an accident after he broke lockdown rules in March, has found adapting to an empty stadium tough.&ldquo;People said it would be different once we got out there because you would know it is on TV and there are millions watching,&rdquo; he told Villa TV.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird. You do feel it is like a game behind closed doors, probably like a non- competitive game. &ldquo;You try not to think like that because it is a competitive game and you are fighting for points.&ldquo;But it is hard, if I am honest. All we can do now is give our all to the end of the season and try to get results&ldquo;I love playing with fans and performing in front of fans and showing what I can do.&rdquo;Chelsea loanee Danny Drinkwater, who missed Wednesday&rsquo;s draw through injury, cannot play against his parent club, while John McGinn will be assessed as he returns from a fractured ankle.Bjorn Engels (Achilles) is out along with long-term knee injury victims Wesley and Tom Heaton. Keinan Davis could earn his second Premier League start after a full top-flight bow on Wednesday and boss Dean Smith feels the 22-year-old can help Villa survive.&ldquo;I thought his impact was really good but it was what I&rsquo;d seen in the last four weeks of training and in the practice matches we&rsquo;d had,&rdquo; he told a press conference.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be a top player. He&rsquo;s a lad who has come through the academy and I&rsquo;ve always said I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of him and that the biggest problem is keeping him fit.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s had a few little niggles and injuries over the last 18 months, and he needed a long period without injury.

 It also means that, should he wish to utilise all of the substitutes available to him, he will have to make a double change at some point during the game.
 It was a rule that wasn’t given too much thought ahead of the restart of the league on Wednesday but did cause a dilemma for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta when his team took on Manchester City.
 Two separate injuries in the first half of the game, to midfielder Granit Xhaka and defender Pablo Mari, meant that the Gunners’ head coach was forced to use two of his three substitute breaks before 45 minutes.

Initial newspaper accounts referred to fewer than 10 people killed, including two whites. However, in the aftermath, an investigation by the NAACP said interviews with townspeople suggested between 30 and 60 black people were killed. The NAACP called for an official investigation but none occurred.
 The Ocoee massacre was just one of many that engulfed communities across the country during the Jim Crow era. The better-known Tulsa Massacre, considered one of the country’s deadliest race riots, broke out just months after Ocoee.
 In 1923, the predominantly African American town of Rosewood, Florida, was destroyed by white mobs. The massacre drew widespread attention when it became the subject of a feature film. In 1994, the state of Florida agreed to compensate survivors and their descendants.
 Bracy and state Rep. Kamia Brown, both Democrats, wanted similar compensation for descendants of the Ocoee riots but failed to muster support from the Republican-controlled Legislature.
 Instead, lawmakers unanimously approved legislation meant to raise awareness about the 1920 riots — the bill now before the governor. The bill also includes a provision that would designates the second week in November as “Holocaust Education Week.”
 “It’s really important that people know this history, so that we are able to move forward especially in the climate we have going on in our country,” Brown said.
 Over the years, the massacre in Ocoee had become mostly forgotten. A few modest memorials have gone up in recent years.
 But the Orange County Regional History Center will commemorate the massacre’s centennial this fall, hoping to foster understanding of the forces that led up to it and the racial tensions that endure decades since.
 “We need to tell the story because it shows how far we’ve come today and how far we haven’t, especially in light of recent events,” said Pam Schwartz, the chief curator of the exhibit called “Yesterday, this was home: The Ocoee Massacre of 1920.”
 Amid global protests inspired by the police killing of George Floyd, Schwartz hopes the exhibit will provide some historical context for the Black Lives Matter movement and what she called the “racial terror” that still flares up across the United States.
 ”This is part of a collective history that hearkens back to a century ago,” she said. “Nothing has changed. It just looks different now.”

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says wantaway winger Ryan Fraser has played his last game for the relegation-threatened club. Fraser, whose contract expires later this month, declined to sign a short-term extension to remain at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the prolonged Premier League season.The 26-year-old will not be involved in Saturday&rsquo;s home game against Crystal Palace or next week&rsquo;s trip to Wolves as the 18th-placed Cherries scrap for survival. Howe expressed regret at the circumstances of Fraser&rsquo;s impending departure on a free transfer but wants to select players who are prepared to fight &ldquo;tooth and nail&rdquo; for the cause.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was particularly surprised by his decision. I think it&rsquo;s been clear to us as a club for some time that Ryan wasn&rsquo;t going to sign a new contract with us,&rdquo; Howe said at a press conference.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s now played his last game for the football club, he won&rsquo;t be involved with us for the last nine games.&ldquo;I only want players who are fully focused on the relegation battle that we have ahead and I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing that with my squad.&ldquo;These are the most important games this football club has had in recent times and we need everybody in the same position mentally, fighting tooth and nail, giving everything for the football club and Ryan unfortunately, due to his contractual situation, can&rsquo;t commit to that.&rdquo;Scotland international Fraser joined the Cherries from Aberdeen in January 2013 and made 208 appearances, scoring 24 times.He won the supporters&rsquo; player of the year award for the 2018-19 campaign.&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t deserve this ending but circumstances have arose that has made this happen,&rdquo; Howe added.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad for him because he&rsquo;s had a really good link with the supporters, they&rsquo;ve really loved him in his time here.&ldquo;For it to end the way that it has done is uncomfortable for me, lots of sad emotions for me because it shouldn&rsquo;t have ended like this.&rdquo;After a season blighted by injury, Howe believes the current squad at his disposal is the &ldquo;strongest&rdquo; he has been able to select from this term.The enforced break in action caused by the coronavrius pandemic has allowed influential winger David Brooks additional time to recover from a long-term ankle problem. Brooks has not appeared for the club for almost 14 months and Howe is optimistic the player&rsquo;s overdue return will provide a significant boost.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s looked very good in training so far, he&rsquo;s overcome – touch wood – the ankle problem that he had,&rdquo; said Howe.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got better and better as the training has gone on. In terms of his game involvement, that&rsquo;s a difficult one to predict. Time will tell on that. Will he play every minute of every game? Probably not.&ldquo;Will he be able to hopefully contribute majorly to our fight against relegation? Hopefully, yes.&rdquo;Bournemouth spent lockdown in the bottom three after being beaten 2-1 at runaway leaders Liverpool before the suspension of play.With constant speculation about how the season would be concluded, Howe feared his team could have been relegated without another ball being kicked.&ldquo;It was a big concern through lockdown – all the media stories that we were reading – that would it be taken out of our hands, would we lose our Premier League status with the season suspended,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;That was a big worry. I tried not to spend too much time focusing on things I couldn&rsquo;t control. (I&rsquo;m) very, very pleased to be back to football and the results will define our future long-term, not elsewhere.&rdquo;

Juneteenth marked a turning point in the fight to free African-Americans from bonds of slavery, and African-Americans in Texas (one of the last hold outs) and nationwide celebrated it as a day of freedom. There were other proposals for designating an official holiday to celebrate the end of slavery, but Juneteenth was the event that stuck.

China would not like to see any attempts by the Indian army to buffer in this area because it exposes the plateau of Aksai Chin, which they have illegally occupied for over five decades.  China has also been troubled by India's rapid strides in refurbishing infrastructure in critical sectors in Arunachal Pradesh and in Ladakh, including bridges along the key Darbuk-Shyok- Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road. India, however, is determined to continue to build border infrastructure, despite the hazard of face-offs with the Chinese.

TALLAHASSEE — Gov.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. spent his whole life chasing meaningful rewards.
 He waited longingly for a pat on the back from his famous father, worked diligently to generate compliments from crew members and other drivers and reveled in the roar of his fans -- those he inherited from his father and the new ones he brought along for the ride.
 NASCAR's longtime fan favorite received the sport's biggest honor Tuesday, being selected to join his father in the series' Hall of Fame. Earnhardt will be inducted in Charlotte, North Carolina, along with the late Mike Stefanik and 87-year-old Red Farmer, who is planning to race on Talladega's dirt track this weekend. Ralph Seagraves was named the Landmark Award winner for his contributions to the sport.
 Despite never winning a series championship, Earnhardt still received 76% of the votes cast on the modern era ballot.
 "Just talking about it, it's really emotional because I feed off affirmation," he said wistfully. "It's such a great feeling to know people think I made an impact. I know what my numbers are and I feel like I was chosen because of that but also for the impact I made off the track, being an ambassador for the sport."
 Being an Earnhardt name certainly comes with its advantages.
 Junior's grandfather, Ralph, went into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1997 and was named one of the NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998. Junior's father, The Intimidator, also made the list and even before finishing his career with 76 wins and a record-tying seven Cup titles.
 The team-owning father even gave Dale Jr. his first big break, a full-time ride in the Busch Series in 1998. It didn't take long for Junior to prove he was a natural -- on and off the track.
 He won Busch championships in each of his first two seasons, then two races as a rookie Cup driver in 2000.
 But when the elder Earnhardt was killed during the 2001 Daytona 500, Junior suddenly found himself in a place he never imagined.
 "I knew when dad died I was going to assume most if not all of his fan base and I feel like I took care of that," he said. "I didn't squander that, I didn't ruin that and I also introduced myself to a lot of people who never heard of Dale Earnhardt."
 Suddenly, the brash 26-year-old Earnhardt emerged as the face of the sport and started adding his own chapter to the family legacy. He won 26 races before retiring as a full-time Cup driver following the 2017 season, including two Daytona 500s and the 2001 Pepsi 400, the first Cup race held at Daytona after his father's death.
 Still, fans watched to see if he could replicate the fearless style that made his father so popular. Junior never tried to compete with that image.
 "There was a point in my career where i started to think I'm not going to win seven championships; I might not even one. I'm not going to win 100 races; I might not even win 40," he said. "There were a lot of people that wanted me to be as successful as he was and be as aggressive as he was and spin people out or whatever. So I started to think about what I could do outside of that and what else I could do to help the sport."
 Junior introduced stock-car racing to a new fans through different news outlets, social media and podcasts. The result: Fifteen consecutive Most Popular Driver awards.
 While Earnhardt will be the headliner at the induction ceremony, he's impressed by his new classmates, too.
 Stefanik won seven titles in NASCAR's modified series and two more in the Busch North series. The nine total victories is tied for second in series history with Richie Evans and Stefanik was named the second greatest driver in modified history in 2003.
 The 61-year-old Stefanik, who died from injuries sustained in a plane crash in Connecticut last September, edged out Ricky Rudd for the second spot on the ballot with 49% of the vote.
 "Phenomenal when you think about what he did. Nine championships," Kyle Petty said during NBCSN's announcement show. "Phenomenal record, phenomenal amount of wins."
 Farmer, one of the three original "Alabama Gang" members with brothers Bobby and Donnie Allison, beat out Hershel McGriff by earning 71% of the vote on the pioneer ballot.
 The 87-year-old Farmer won four Late Model Sportsmen season titles, an estimated 700 to 900 races and also was a member of NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers. He also is a member of the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2004 and this week with the big series returning to Talladega, he's scrambling to put together a car for two nights of racing on the dirt track across the street.
 "I had a little fender-bender in a 40-lapper last weekend," he said. "They had a three or four-car pile up right in front of me and I slid into it and messed up the nose pretty good. So I'm getting my backup car ready."
 Seagraves helped find new sponsors, including former title sponsor Winston, as well as refurbishing tracks.

With so much uncertainty, Larry Quinn can't predict just how severe the NHL's financial losses might be due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 That doesn't stop the former Buffalo Sabres managing partner from providing a bleak assessment, at least for the short term.
 "They've got big challenges ahead," Quinn said. "And the problem is that you don't know the answers to the questions you have to ask."
 The questions are many at a time the NHL hopes to go ahead with a 24-team expanded playoff format in a bid to conclude the season with no clear timetable of when to open the next one. It could be as late as January, though Commissioner Gary Bettman has said it would be a full 82 games.
 Many NHL issues are similar to those facing North America's other major professional leagues, such as when fans will be allowed to attend games. Others are more distinct to hockey, such as the effect the drop of the Canadian dollar will have on a league with seven of its 31 teams based north of the border.
 The NHL was a $2.3 billion business with a $39 million salary cap coming out of the lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season. It broke the $5 billion mark in 2018-19, with an $81.5 million cap this past season.
 Quinn said the NHL's bottom line could be sheared in half in the short term, effectively erasing the gains made since owners and players reached a revenue- sharing agreement following the lockout. The anticipated drop in revenue has already caused a large ripple through the league.
 At least 10 teams have laid off employees or announced indefinite furloughs, with many executives taking pay cuts. Just this week, the Sabres made a drastic series of cost-cutting moves by firing general manager Jason Botterill and his assistants, 12 of 21 scouts and their entire minor league coaching staff. Owner Terry Pegula specifically cited uncertain times raised by the pandemic, and a desire to become a "leaner" and "more efficient" operation.
 Players are bracing for lost salaries by continuing to defer whether to receive their final paychecks. They are also in jeopardy of losing the portion of pay put aside in an escrow account, which rolls over to the owners should revenue fall short of projections; players have lost upward of 10% of their pay to escrow over the past seven-plus seasons and it is a major issue in upcoming labor talks.
 Former NHL executive-turned-broadcaster Brian Burke said the pain will be felt by teams and players alike.
 "I said seven weeks ago, if we lost this season and part of next season, I could foresee a $40 million salary cap," he added. "I don't think it's going to get to that point. And I know one option that's being discussed is deferral of some of these wages they're paid and see what happens, and when the revenue bounces back they can get paid."
 Bettman recently said gate receipts, while significant, don't make up a majority of league revenue. But gate revenue is key to the NHL because it lags behind its counterparts in television dollars.
 The NHL has a 10-year, $2 billion deal with NBC, that expires after next season. It has a 12-year deal with Canada's Rogers TV that began in 2014-15, and is worth $5.2 billion Canadian. In comparison, the NFL makes more than $5 billion annually from broadcasting rights agreements.
 The Canadian dollar plays a major role in league finances, with player salaries paid in U.S currency. That wasn't an issue in 2007, when the Canadian dollar briefly jumped above par, which was reflected in the NHL's salary cap making its largest two-year gain, going from $44 million in 2006-07 to $56.7 million in 2008-09.
 That's not the case today, with the Canadian dollar at the 75-cent range. Teams north of the border project losing $400,000 each time the Canadian dollar drops a penny, putting a strain on their ability to compete for or retain high-priced talent.
 The uncertainty has led to all general managers unable to assess their rosters and payrolls beyond this season.
 "What happens to the cap? Does the cap go down because revenues are going to decrease? Do they artificially keep it where it's at?" Washington Capitals GM Brian MacLellan said. "Those are just open-ended questions, and we discuss them, but we don't come up with any answers."
 Issues arising from the pandemic have slowed negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement, with the current deal expiring in September 2022.
 "What's the revenue going to be next year? If you tell me that, the bargaining's pretty easy," NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. "If you don't know that, it becomes a little more complicated."
 Questions remain even if fans are allowed to attend games next season. There are concerns fans won't return at the same numbers if there is no vaccine available. Others worry fans won't have the same disposable income for luxuries like games.
 "(Sports is) the first casualty of economic hard times," Burke said. "So you've got smaller crowds or no crowds. ... You've got no suite revenue. So it's very corrosive."
 Attorney Irwin Kishner, who has represented numerous teams and leagues, said the NHL must consider out-of-the-box promotional ideas to generate revenue. Tarps on empty seats carrying sponsor logos. Sponsorships on jerseys. Maybe reviving the World Cup of Hockey tournament, which was last held in 2016 and generated an estimated $40 million.
 "This too shall pass. The question is, how do you develop these alternative revenue streams?" Kishner said.
 Burke expressed confidence in the NHL enjoying a quick turnaround.
 "We'll get through it. I think if anything, this pandemic has demonstrated is how much people love the game and how much they miss the game," Burke said. "The next 18 months are going to be hard. But I think we'll be just fine after that."

The assessment states: “The new facilities are required to provide purpose- built space to meet the future operational requirements of these new aircraft at RAF Waddington.
 “Currently the exact size, height and layout of the proposed buildings has not been finalised and this will evolve following an internal design process with the RAF, Boeing and MoD.
 “However, for the purposes of this request, the proposed new buildings are anticipated to total approximately 65,500 sq m and will likely be over two floors, but potentially three as a worst-case scenario.”
 The plans would also see a new access route from the A15 Sleaford Road for use once the development is up and running, although the exact location of this is yet to be finalised.
 The existing taxiway would also be upgraded as its condition has degraded and it would not be wide enough for the new aircraft to use.

 The Collier County community, with roughly 24,000 residents, has logged nearly 1,200 cases as of Wednesday, according to the Florida Department of Health.
 But members of the tightly knit agricultural enclave say it isn’t the farmworkers’ fault that they are getting sick.
 They maintain the federal government has deemed them “essential workers” and the state has been slow to provide the community with the resources farmworker advocates have requested to slow the spread of the highly contagious virus.
 Antonio Tovar, executive director of the Farmworker Association of Florida, accused DeSantis of ignoring pleas from a coalition of 50 groups that asked the governor for help in late April.
 “We sent this letter to the governor more than two months ago and now he is realizing that foreign workers are more suitable to get infected. That is very shameful because he was advised, he was told when we sent the letter,” Tovar told The News Service of Florida on Wednesday.
 The letter asked DeSantis, Florida Cabinet members and state lawmakers to expand access to COVID-19 testing in rural areas, provide more personal protective gear to farmworkers and offer alternative housing options to workers who live in crowded conditions.
 When the request went unanswered, Tovar said the association enlisted three women to make more than 200 cloth face coverings for workers.
 Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried also highlighted the farmworkers’ plight in a 10-page report submitted to a task force set up by the governor to make recommendations about reopening the state following widespread shutdowns in response to the novel coronavirus.
 Fried asked the task force to provide better health care services to farmworkers to prevent the spread of COVID-19, noting that less than half of farm workers have health insurance. She also called on the state to provide more face coverings for workers and less crowded housing options.
 DeSantis’ spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre said the governor long ago targeted the agriculture industry as potentially high risk for the spread of COVID-19.

Founded in 1998, the shop, Kaguraya, has dedicated itself to producing kagura outfits with their meticulously designed embroidery.
 But its cash flow situation started to deteriorate in February, when orders from local kagura communities — themselves grappling with the economic fallout of the pandemic — stopped coming in.
 With the resumption of orders still nowhere in sight, the shop was eventually forced to lay off all of its seven employees, including four full-time workers, at the end of May.
 “We had artisans who had worked for us for more than 10 years,” lamented Hidemi Sugezawa, 62, president of the shop, adding that he felt sorry to have to let them go. The layoffs have now left Sugezawa as the only person keeping the shop running.
 Each outfit is typically the result of months of hand stitching by artisans, making it difficult for the shop to earn revenue on a daily basis. The most elaborate costumes require more than six months of work and sell for around ¥2 million apiece, but even they are not as profitable as many may think.
 “I’ve had some rough patches over the years, but I’ve been able to get through them because of the sheer passion I have for kagura,” said Sugezawa.
 “This time around, though, I just don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s tough.”
 His dismay is shared by his 64-year-old brother, Yoshinori, who, as an artisan of the traditional masks worn by kagura dancers, runs his own business at a studio in the town of Kitahiroshima.
 Yoshinori, too, saw the flow of new orders stop after February. As a show of support, a couple of kagura fans bought masks that cost them ¥30,000 to ¥40,000 a piece, but that has done little to allay his concerns over the future of the business.
 Kagura communities have been unable to commit to buying new costumes because the cancellations of their shows have cut off their main source of income. Shows slated to be performed at Hiroshima Prefectural Citizen’s Culture Center, for example, have all been called off, with the fate of fall festivals now in jeopardy. Not only that, it costs a lot just to maintain the trucks they use to carry equipment.
 “Even if the shows resumed, I wonder if profitability would be good enough because they would have to keep some seats empty” for social distancing purposes, Yoshinori said.
 “Orders for masks will remain sluggish as long as the shows continue to be scaled back.”
 Shinji Ueda, a representative of a kagura community in the Otsuka district of Kitahiroshima, says he has been making purchases from the Sugezawa brothers, placing great trust in the services the two provide.
 “We’ve known each other for a long time, and they have always been meticulous in responding to even my most abrupt and minute requests,” Ueda said.
 It’s the kind of relationship of trust that Sugezawa cherishes.
 “What I think is ideal is the tradition of kagura being supported by local artisans and fans. I want to keep my shop afloat no matter what,” Sugasawa said.

This COVID-19, pandemic has become a test for faith practising worse than even, Terrorism, Islamophobia, Crusaders and Zionism. Saudi was earliest to declare lockdown and now in 1st week of April they applied Curfew. The pilgrimage rituals of Umra stopped and now Hajj was announced unlikely to be taken place this year. Which is a right decision circumstantially. Saudi makes large profit from Pilgrimage. Other than Saudis profit making, the faith practitioners desires and emotion is the factor been put on the back burner. Since there is a lockdown situation, Pilgrimages not allowed to take place, why not, Saudi government in this time, meanwhile, get on with improvement of Mina Sanitation facility to be upgraded to international acceptable hygiene regulation.

Sebring Assistant City Administrator Bob Hoffman said the show’s price tag is $20,000, the same as last year. The City of Sebring put $7,500 toward the bill. Contributions from local businesses and individuals pick up the rest of the tab. Hoffman said they were still a couple hundred dollars short but was confident the difference would be made up by July 4.
 The fireworks in Sebring can be seen from many different spots. Hoffman suggests Veteran’s Beach, Hidden Beach and along U.S. 27. There is no parking on the lake side of U.S. 27, so parking would have to be done on privately owned land. Several public parking spots are available near the lake downtown. Patriotic music will be provided by Mobile Music and More DJ Services.
 Avon Park will follow suit with fireworks being set off at 9 p.m. over Lake Verona of July 4. Donaldson Park is a favorite viewing area.
 Good news of live performances: Highlands Lakeside Threatre, at 356 W. Center Ave. in Sebring, will be hosting its traditional Patriotic Revue with limited capacity. The shows will start at 11 a.m. and run on the hour until 3 p.m. The performances last about a half hour. The performances are free, but donations are appreciated. Funds will be used for scholarships and camperships. For more information, call 863-382-2525.
 The 26th annual Firecracker 5K will look far different as it is being held virtually this year. Complete your 3.1-mile or 5k run/walk distance between now and July 4th on a route in your neighborhood, on a treadmill or park.
