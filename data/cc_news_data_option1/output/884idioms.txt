Coronavirus is spreading fast in India, and has infected close to 30 people. But the investors are not disheartened and do not see any long-term impact when it comes to betting on India.


  "Some of the best companies that you might want to invest in are now within a stock price range that you could afford. As for our portfolio companies, we just have to ensure that we stand by them through this time. We'll help them through the crisis. We see a long term demand slowdown of maximum two years due to this which is not a large impact," said Sandeep Naik, Managing Director & Head India and Southeast Asia, General Atlantic, according to Livemint.


  Naik was speaking at the Mint India Investment Summit being held at Mumbai.


  Anuj Ranjan, Managing Partner, Brookfield Asset Management and CEO of India and Middle East, said, his company invests in businesses for the long term.


  "We are an investor and we invest in businesses for the long term. Geo- political events keep happening but we look at businesses from a 10-year horizon," said Ranjan, according to Livemint.


  Many companies across the country are taking a slew of precautionary measures to contain the spread of coronavirus.


  IT firms in Haryana's Gurugram have asked staff to work from home. Nagarro, a Gururgam-based software company, asked its employees to avoid non-essential travel, and work from home unless it was necessary to come to the office. The companies have also asked their staff to take preventive measures and avoid crowded areas.


  Manesar-based exporters and those in Udyog Vihar have restricted foreign travel and asked their buyers to postpone visits to India.


  Hundreds of people who could have come in contact with the three patients are being closely observed while the authorities work up a plan to trace the possible spread of the virus.


  Coronavirus has spread to as many as 60 countries across the globe and has claimed over 3,000 lives worldwide.

When Autumn de Wilde was asked to make a pitch for a new film adaptation of Jane Austen's "Emma," she "kind of flipped out."


   


  De Wilde gathered silk ribbons, postcards, newsprint and 19th-century fashion illustrations to bring to the pitch meeting, laying all the material on a table.


   


  "I think by spreading it out, you could get this sort of side view of the film, because it was in all the chaos of the cards. You can see the colors of the film emerge," de Wilde told the American-Statesman on the phone in February.


   


  "Emma" follows Emma Woodhouse, portrayed by the wide-eyed Anya Taylor-Joy, as she plays matchmaker in the early 1800s in the English village of Highbury. Emma, who is rich, young and beautiful, traverses first loves and missteps.


   


  De Wilde's film is the latest in a line of screen adaptations of Austen's 1815 novel, including a 1996 Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle and "Clueless" (yes, that "Clueless"). "Emma" -- de Wilde's feature directorial debut, though she's well-known as a photographer -- opened in select Austin theaters last weekend and expands to more theaters this week.


   


  This "Emma" is delectable. De Wilde infused her take with inspiration from screwball comedies like "Bringing Up Baby." Viewers peer into a tightly wound imagining of Highbury. Every scene disarms the audience with Seussian hairdos and bright colors straight out of an Easter basket; chatty townspeople fling dialogue back and forth.


   


  When de Wilde learned she had booked the movie, she flew to New York the same day to ask Taylor-Joy to be her Emma Woodhouse.


   


  De Wilde said of learning she had won the directing job, "I think when you're a kid, you imagine something like that, you're jumping up and down screaming, but I think it was just like this long silence. And then, I kind of had to spring into action."


   


  Taylor-Joy, known for roles in indie films like "The Witch" and "Thoroughbreds," agreed to the part during a lunch that was supposed to last one hour but turned into five, de Wilde said.


   


  In Taylor-Joy's hands, Emma is precise and polite but given to causing offense. She's sometimes her own worst enemy. Peeking into de Wilde's "Emma" world might make you feel like you're back in middle or high school, experiencing first loves, embarrassments and mistakes all over again. It's nice to remember how warm a brand new friend who just gets you feels, or how divine it can be when a romantic love appears, causing butterflies and a lump in your throat.


   


  We talked with de Wilde about first loves, directing and more. Here are a few highlights from our conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity.


   


  American-Statesman: What do you hope people take away from your "Emma"?


   


  I think that this book is so legendary that it could be interpreted and reinterpreted so many different ways. ... I think, honestly, that the world is pretty rough right now, you know? It's pretty dark out there. We're seeing it really clearly, and I think it's healthy to have a couple of hours off to do a little time travel and escape. Because whether we're at war or not, people still have crushes, and they still disappoint their best friend.


   


  I hope that people feel that they get a sort of delicious escape into Emma's fantasy world and feel some connection to her and that town of Highbury.


   


  Whether things were funny or serious in the movie, the physical movements the actors made were methodical and small. What was behind that directing choice?


   


  I studied ballet for 14 years when I was younger, and that's probably why I love old movies so much. A lot of old movies feel kind of like a musical, but no one sings. There's a stylized type of talking and moving. I really wanted to approach (the movie) this way, and the actors were really game.


   


  I did choreograph every scene almost like a ballet, and then the actors would sort of bring that choreography to life and sometimes move against it. What's cool is if you start with a structure and a character needs to rebel against that clockwork movement, it was significant because everyone was sort of moving in circles. I told everyone that this movie was like Emma's cuckoo clock, with all these mechanisms -- and dancing, like a music box with a ballerina in the middle. I said, ''Everything physically needs to work effortlessly and gracefully and slowly." ... It made it funnier when someone was awkward.


   


  I really loved the love story, of sorts, between Emma and her friend, Harriet (played by Mia Goth).


   


  That was really important to me, and that was part of my pitch. I felt like what I see in that friendship is ... that (your) first best friend -- especially, it feels like, between two girls -- is a passionate love. Especially the friendships that happen before anyone has their first kiss. I think it's a deep love that happens early in your years, and possibly too early for you to realize the fragility of it and the power of that kind of friendship, and how important it is and how much of it relies on trust.


   


  There's recently been a lot of talk about women directors, especially after none were nominated at the Oscars this year. Is that something you think about? Do you have any ideas, from your position, about how that problem can be fixed?


   


  I don't think it's healthy to think of myself in another category, like another breed. I definitely came up against a lot of walls in my career as a photographer, and especially in rock 'n' roll (photography) I was a bit outnumbered.


   


  Every challenge that I had, I just decided to take that challenge to be better. ... I just wanted there to be no excuse why I shouldn't have the job. Which you shouldn't have to do, but what's wrong with getting better and better at what you do?


   


  As a photographer, I think that a big problem is that women aren't being documented at work in a fascinating, cinematic way.


   


  Studios should be investing in the fantasy documentary of that pertinent work, because that's unfortunately also how when you vote for a politician, you tend to vote for the person you could imagine at work. And women have to deal with people going, "Well, can she do it on her period?" I think it's really good to see people, like women, also looking tired and overwhelmed in that exciting, passionate way.

The US conducted Wednesday its first airstrike against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, a military spokesman said, days after signing an ambitious peace deal with the militant group in the Mideastern state of Qatar.US military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett said in a tweet that the "defensive" strike was the first US attack against the militants in 11 days. He said the attack was to counter a Taliban assault on Afghan government forces in Nahr-e Saraj in the southern Helmand province.Leggett added that Taliban forces had conducted 43 attacks on Afghan troops on Tuesday in Helmand. According to a spokesman for the province's governor, Omer Zwak, at least two police officers were killed and one other wounded in the Washir district of southern Helmand.Leggett called on the Taliban to stop the attacks and uphold their commitments based on the agreement signed on Feb. 29 between their leaders and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Doha, Qatar, which lays out a conditions-based path to the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan.President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he spoke on the phone to a Taliban leader, making him the first US president believed to have ever spoken directly with the militant group responsible for the deaths of thousands of US troops in nearly 19 years of fighting in Afghanistan.The Afghan Defense Ministry said in another statement on Thursday that a Taliban attack on a checkpoint in northern Kunduz province had killed seven of its soldiers.The statement said that ten Taliban fighters were killed in the shoot-out.Kandahar police spokesman Jamal Naser Barekzai told The Associated Press that a police officer was killed and one wounded in a string of Taliban attacks across the province.The Taliban have not claimed responsibility for any of these attacks so far or commented on the US airstrike Wednesday.However, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the AP Wednesday that a week of reduction in violence that started midnight on Feb. 21 had ended.Based on the US -Taliban deal, peace negotiations between the warring Afghan sides are supposed to begin on March 10. However, the Afghan government has already rejected releasing Taliban prisoners ahead of launching the talks, a precondition which the militants say was part of the US agreement.Leggett said that US forces are responsible for defending their Afghan allies according to agreements between US and Afghan governments.

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah told his cabinet on Tuesday that he has ordered the purchase of 5,000 coronavirus testing kits and the release of Rs100 million for adopting preventive measures against the viral emergency in the province.


  Shah chaired the meeting of the advisory group at the CM House, where the chief secretary and provincial ministers, advisers and relevant secretaries were also in attendance.


  The CM said that after the first coronavirus case was diagnosed, he started holding daily meetings and formed a task force that he himself is overseeing.


  "I'm holding regular meetings of the task force in which all the people concerned, including experts, doctors, airport and aviation authorities, the FIA, Nadra and the WHO, are on board," he said, adding that so far 53 tests have been conducted, of which only two were positive.


  He disclosed that isolation wards have been established at nine hospitals with 118 beds. He said the Indus Hospital and the Aga Khan University Hospital have been helping out a lot in this regard.


  "I have tasked the Indus Hospital with looking after all of the coronavirus issues, from conducting tests and keeping the suspects in isolation to providing them with treatment, and my government has given them a grant of Rs100 million to purchase kits and other necessary equipment," he said.


  Sindh water act


  The local government department presented a draft of the Sindh Water Act 2020 regarding the use of ground and surface water for commercial purposes. The CM said ground water and agriculture water are being dealt with by different departments, so this task cannot be transferred to a single authority.


  Therefore, he constituted a committee headed by him, with the CS, the LG minister, the irrigation minister, the agriculture minister and the public health minister as members. The committee will review the draft and may form a separate body to regulate the matters of ground water.


  Tractor scheme


  The agriculture department told the cabinet that three phases of tractor purchase on government subsidy had been completed but the fourth phase came to a standstill after the


  National Accountability Bureau (NAB) took up the issue.


  Under the plan 6,200 tractors would be given on the basis of a government subsidy. The government had released Rs450 million to the Sindh Bank for the subsidy when the fourth phase of the programme was halted.


  Now NAB has issued guidelines in accordance with which the cabinet approved to start the fourth phase. The cabinet was told that the balloting for the applicant who had applied for the programme was conducted when the scheme was launched.


  Wheat plan


  The food department told the cabinet about the wheat procurement plan for the crop season 2019-20. Under the plan fair distribution of bardana among growers will be ensured, as particularly district-wise procurement target will be fixed on proportionate basis.


  The cabinet also approved the purchase of 20 per cent jute bags and 80 per cent PP bags for wheat procurement. The advisory group also decided that functional flour mills will be allowed to retain wheat stock of 90 days as per their sanctioned or grinding capacity.


  The food department proposed Rs1,400 as the price of wheat per 40 kilograms. On this the CM said the federal government has fixed Rs1,365 per 40kg as the support price and it is going to revise it. He directed the CS to coordinate with the federal government so that the Centre and the provinces could fix the same minimum support price. He said that this decision should be taken within the next four days because the harvesting of wheat has already been started.


  Economic zone


  The cabinet approved the transfer of 1,530 acres of land located in Deh Gharo, Dhabeji, District Thatta to the investment department to establish it as the Dhabeji Special Economic Zone under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.


  The advisory group also fixed the price of the land at 25 per cent of the market value of an acre, which the investment department would pay to the revenue department and would start development of the economic zone. The CM said the economic zone would provide new vistas of employment opportunities and prosperity in the province.


  Vice chancellors


  The cabinet granted another term to eight vice chancellors who are eminent academics: NED University's Dr SH Lodhi, Mehran University's Dr Aslam Uqaili, Shah Abdul Latif University's Prof Parveen Shah, LUMHS Jamshoro's Prof Bikha Ram, IBA Sukkur's Prof Nisar Siddiqui, JSM University's Prof Tariq Rafi, Dawood University's Dr Faizullah Abbasi and BBS University Khairpur's Dr Madad Ali Shah.


  Mirpurkhas university


  In Mirpurkhas, a campus of the Sindh University was established in 2009 that was offering bachelor's and master's programmes. At present the campus is running nine bachelor's and master's programmes with a 1,000-strong enrolment.


  The CM said the Mirpurkhas division has no full-fledged university, so the campus may be upgraded to university. He added that the division has three districts -- Mirpurkhas, Tharparkar and Umerkot -- with a population of 4.5 million, so there should be a university for such a huge population. The proposal was supported by minister Hari Ram, an MPA from Mirpurkhas, as well as all the other cabinet members. The universities & boards department presented the draft bill of the University of Mirpurkhas Act 2020, which the cabinet approved. The advisory group directed the law department to vet the draft so it could be presented in the assembly.


  Shaikh Ayaz University


  The cabinet also approved the jurisdiction of the Shaikh Ayaz University, Shikarpur. Under the jurisdiction, all the degree colleges of the Larkana division would be affiliated with the Shaikh Ayaz University.


  The degree colleges and law colleges of the division are presently affiliated with the Shah Abdul Latif University Khairpur, which falls under the Sukkur division. Now, public and private degree colleges, law colleges and other institutions affiliated with the Shah Abdul Latif University will switch over to the Shaikh Ayaz University. The cabinet approved the proposal.


  Film censors


  The culture department presented the matter of providing remuneration or fee to the members of the Sindh Board of Films Censors for the censorship of films. The cabinet approved different rates for 12 categories. The cabinet also approved the de-notification of two additional advocates general as well as four assistant advocates general.

Iraq said a 70-year-old Muslim cleric died on Wednesday from the novel coronavirus, the first death from the outbreak in a country where 31 people have been infected.


  The Iraqi preacher had been quarantined in the northeastern city of Sulaimaniyah before his death, a spokesman for the Kurdish autonomous region's health authority said.


  According to local sources, he had recently met with Iraqis returning from neighbouring Iran, which has recorded the third deadliest outbreak outside China, the epidemic's epicentre.


  Across the world, 3,155 people have died from the virus, with China recording 2,943 deaths, Italy 79 while 77 people have died in Iran from the disease.


  Iraq is one of Iran's largest export markets and a popular destination for Iranian pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala.


  Many Iraqis also cross the frontier for business, tourism, medical treatment and religious studies.


  Iraqi authorities have closed land borders with Iran and banned the entry of foreign nationals travelling from there and other badly affected countries.


  Schools, universities, cinemas, cafes and other public places in Iraq have been ordered shut until March 7 to further contain the outbreak, but many continue to operate normally.


  Responding to Wednesday's death, Sulaimaniyah Governor Haval Abu Bakr told reporters that all rallies in the province will be banned and that all football matches will now be held behind closed doors.


  Local religious authorities for their part announced a ban on mass prayers, including on Fridays, until further notice.


  The outbreak has fuelled public panic among Iraqis who say the war-ravaged country's healthcare system cannot handle the epidemic.


  Many hospitals in Iraq are poorly equipped or in disrepair after successive waves of conflict.


  According to the World Health Organization, there are fewer than 10 doctors for every 10,000 people.

The opening moments of Onward whisk us back to a world of wonder, populated by galloping centaurs, spell-casting wizards and fire-breathing dragons. Speaking of which, you'll be forgiven for briefly wondering if you've stumbled into a How to Train Your Dragon sequel by mistake. The digital wizards at Pixar Animation Studios pride themselves, with good reason, on their originality and ingenuity, but this particular once-upon-a-time scene-setter feels curiously, even knowingly derivative. It means to remind us of an era when magic ruled the Earth, and to assure us that it will rule again.


  Real magic, by which I mean genuinely transporting fantasy, isn't an easy thing for a movie to promise in this day and age. The major studios - including the ravenous hydra-headed content factory that is Disney - are often content to deliver spectacle without wonder, churning out familiar stories and prepackaged life lessons to be wearily received by a seen-it-all audience.


  And so it's understandable that Onward, Pixar's 22nd animated feature, would express some nostalgia for a purer, grander storytelling past, even as its title points with insistent optimism toward the future.


  And I'm pleased to report that said optimism is not entirely unfounded. Although it does not join the likes of The Incredibles and WALL-E in the pantheon of company masterworks, Onward is a touching, lovingly crafted oddity - a movie that acknowledges its borrowed elements at the outset and then proceeds to reinvigorate them with tried-and-true Pixar virtues: sly wit, dazzling invention and a delicacy of feeling that approaches the sublime.


  The result may sound like an incongruous pileup of genres on paper - picture an ancient storybook quest, a rowdy '80s-flavored buddy comedy and an out-and- out male weepie in a noisy three-way collision - but there are glimmers of real enchantment and honest feeling amid the rubble.


  You'll forgive the car crash metaphor, but it seems appropriate, since Onward, most of which unfolds in the present day, boasts more vehicular recklessness than any Pixar movie outside the Cars franchise. The protagonist is a blue-skinned, pointy-eared elf named Ian Lightfoot (voiced by Tom Holland), who has just turned 16 and is thus old enough to learn how to drive - a prospect that, like nearly everything else in life, fills him with dread and anxiety.


  He couldn't be more different from his older brother, Barley (Chris Pratt), a goofy, boisterous slacker who tears up the streets of their suburban hamlet in a rattletrap van named Gwinny (short for Guinevere).


  The conceit of the movie - written by Dan Scanlon (who also directed), Jason Headley and Keith Bunin - is that although we are in a land populated entirely by trolls, centaurs, mermaids and other mythic creatures, magic itself is a thing of the past, having long been eclipsed by science and modern technology. Ian and Barley have a pet dragon, but they also have smartphones, boomboxes and kitchen appliances.


  Their loving mom (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is introduced watching a workout video. Later on, a key supporting character - the lion-bodied, bat-winged, scorpion-tailed manticore (Octavia Spencer) - will agonize over having traded in her life as a fearsome beast of legend for a job in medieval-themed restaurant management.


  The crass commercialization and relentless standardization of modern life has been a choice satirical target for Pixar movies as different as Ratatouille and Toy Story.


  Onward, grounding its fantasy in a dull-hued world of suburbs, freeways, fast-food joints and liquor stores - the Midwest by way of Middle-earth - is no exception.


  Still, those ancient magical traditions have not been entirely forgotten. They have a staunch defender in Barley, a scholar, geek and born adventurer with a deep knowledge of fantasy lore. And naturally, in one of those ironic twists that will force two very different personalities to embark on a long, strange trip, it's not Barley but the shy, magic-averse Ian who turns out to have a natural gift for sorcery when an enchanter's staff falls into their possession - a gift from their beloved father, who died years ago.


  Scanlon, who made his Pixar feature-directing debut with Monsters University, has noted that this movie grew out of his own experience as the younger of two brothers who lost their father at an early age. The untimely death of a parent is, of course, a timeless fairy-tale trope and something of a Disney narrative specialty, but Onward employs the cliche in ways that feel both more personal and more daring.


  Through a series of enjoyably odd contrivances, Ian and Barley's father is magically brought back to life for a day - or rather, the lower half of his body is, thanks to a spell that goes awry in Ian's unskilled hands.


  Perhaps only a company with Pixar's proven track record with unpromising high concepts could see the logic of turning a pair of disembodied, khaki-trousered legs into a major character, even at the risk of inviting a few below-the-belt jokes. It's an initially amusing, sometimes disquieting story choice (shades of the Oscar-nominated I Lost My Body) that eventually wears out its welcome as a sight gag.


  But as a striking image of a father's lingering presence beyond the grave - always there beside you, yet never able to speak - it's not without a certain ghostly resonance. If Scanlon was thinking of his own late father while making this movie, it's only fair for me to admit that I thought of mine while watching it.


  I don't offer this up as unqualified praise, since this is merely the latest (and far from the most seamless) Pixar adventure to double as a poignant meditation on love and loss. Nor would I suggest that the emotional relatability of Onward is its most admirable or remarkable quality. There are mediocre movies that can drain our tear ducts, and great movies that bypass them completely.


  What makes this one pretty good, and sometimes inspired, is that despite the occasional canned sentiment or overly familiar conflict, all those emotions seem to spring naturally from the story's intricate roots. And even at its most unabashedly wacky, that story - stuffed with goofy in-jokes, pulse- quickening action scenes and a supporting cast of leather-clad sprites on mini-motorcycles (what else?) - has been imagined and conceptualized with a recognizably Pixarian rigor.


  It should also be noted, with an up-to-the-minute understanding of popular culture, particularly the tastes of the young men who will make up this unapologetically brotastic movie's key demographic. Holland and Pratt have a winning rapport, in part because they could be starring in a parallel-universe Avengers spinoff with Spider-Man and Star-Lord. The wild adventure they find themselves on has unmistakably Spielbergian undertones, from a climactic set- piece that evokes Indiana Jones to the laughs extracted at the expense of their mom's annoying centaur boyfriend (Mel Rodriguez).


  The puzzles they must solve, the incantations they must utter and the bolts of lightning that erupt from Ian's staff will return more than a few members of the audience to the days they spent happily reading Harry Potter or playing Dungeons & Dragons, even if those days were just last week. Sound like something you've seen before? It is - and somehow, it isn't. Maybe real magic isn't dead after all.

Shah chaired the meeting of the advisory group at the CM House, where the chief secretary and provincial ministers, advisers and relevant secretaries were also in attendance.


  The CM said that after the first coronavirus case was diagnosed, he started holding daily meetings and formed a task force that he himself is overseeing.


  “I’m holding regular meetings of the task force in which all the people concerned, including experts, doctors, airport and aviation authorities, the FIA, Nadra and the WHO, are on board,” he said, adding that so far 53 tests have been conducted, of which only two were positive.


  He disclosed that isolation wards have been established at nine hospitals with 118 beds. He said the Indus Hospital and the Aga Khan University Hospital have been helping out a lot in this regard.


  “I have tasked the Indus Hospital with looking after all of the coronavirus issues, from conducting tests and keeping the suspects in isolation to providing them with treatment, and my government has given them a grant of Rs100 million to purchase kits and other necessary equipment,” he said.


  Sindh water act


  The local government department presented a draft of the Sindh Water Act 2020 regarding the use of ground and surface water for commercial purposes. The CM said ground water and agriculture water are being dealt with by different departments, so this task cannot be transferred to a single authority.


  Therefore, he constituted a committee headed by him, with the CS, the LG minister, the irrigation minister, the agriculture minister and the public health minister as members. The committee will review the draft and may form a separate body to regulate the matters of ground water.


  Tractor scheme


  The agriculture department told the cabinet that three phases of tractor purchase on government subsidy had been completed but the fourth phase came to a standstill after the


  National Accountability Bureau (NAB) took up the issue.


  Under the plan 6,200 tractors would be given on the basis of a government subsidy. The government had released Rs450 million to the Sindh Bank for the subsidy when the fourth phase of the programme was halted.


  Now NAB has issued guidelines in accordance with which the cabinet approved to start the fourth phase. The cabinet was told that the balloting for the applicant who had applied for the programme was conducted when the scheme was launched.


  Wheat plan


  The food department told the cabinet about the wheat procurement plan for the crop season 2019-20. Under the plan fair distribution of bardana among growers will be ensured, as particularly district-wise procurement target will be fixed on proportionate basis.


  The cabinet also approved the purchase of 20 per cent jute bags and 80 per cent PP bags for wheat procurement. The advisory group also decided that functional flour mills will be allowed to retain wheat stock of 90 days as per their sanctioned or grinding capacity.


  The food department proposed Rs1,400 as the price of wheat per 40 kilograms. On this the CM said the federal government has fixed Rs1,365 per 40kg as the support price and it is going to revise it. He directed the CS to coordinate with the federal government so that the Centre and the provinces could fix the same minimum support price. He said that this decision should be taken within the next four days because the harvesting of wheat has already been started.


  Economic zone


  The cabinet approved the transfer of 1,530 acres of land located in Deh Gharo, Dhabeji, District Thatta to the investment department to establish it as the Dhabeji Special Economic Zone under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.


  The advisory group also fixed the price of the land at 25 per cent of the market value of an acre, which the investment department would pay to the revenue department and would start development of the economic zone. The CM said the economic zone would provide new vistas of employment opportunities and prosperity in the province.


  Vice chancellors


  The cabinet granted another term to eight vice chancellors who are eminent academics: NED University’s Dr SH Lodhi, Mehran University’s Dr Aslam Uqaili, Shah Abdul Latif University’s Prof Parveen Shah, LUMHS Jamshoro’s Prof Bikha Ram, IBA Sukkur’s Prof Nisar Siddiqui, JSM University’s Prof Tariq Rafi, Dawood University’s Dr Faizullah Abbasi and BBS University Khairpur’s Dr Madad Ali Shah.


  Mirpurkhas university


  In Mirpurkhas, a campus of the Sindh University was established in 2009 that was offering bachelor’s and master’s programmes. At present the campus is running nine bachelor’s and master’s programmes with a 1,000-strong enrolment.


  The CM said the Mirpurkhas division has no full-fledged university, so the campus may be upgraded to university. He added that the division has three districts — Mirpurkhas, Tharparkar and Umerkot — with a population of 4.5 million, so there should be a university for such a huge population. The proposal was supported by minister Hari Ram, an MPA from Mirpurkhas, as well as all the other cabinet members. The universities & boards department presented the draft bill of the University of Mirpurkhas Act 2020, which the cabinet approved. The advisory group directed the law department to vet the draft so it could be presented in the assembly.


  Shaikh Ayaz University


  The cabinet also approved the jurisdiction of the Shaikh Ayaz University, Shikarpur. Under the jurisdiction, all the degree colleges of the Larkana division would be affiliated with the Shaikh Ayaz University.


  The degree colleges and law colleges of the division are presently affiliated with the Shah Abdul Latif University Khairpur, which falls under the Sukkur division. Now, public and private degree colleges, law colleges and other institutions affiliated with the Shah Abdul Latif University will switch over to the Shaikh Ayaz University. The cabinet approved the proposal.


  Film censors


  The culture department presented the matter of providing remuneration or fee to the members of the Sindh Board of Films Censors for the censorship of films. The cabinet approved different rates for 12 categories. The cabinet also approved the de-notification of two additional advocates general as well as four assistant advocates general.

Season three of Westworld, the robot sci-fi drama, will be coming to HOT HBO, YES Edge and CellcomTV on March 16.   The Internet is awash with fan theories that try to make sense of the cliffhangers from season two, some rather outlandish, but viewers have learned that in Westworld, just about anything can happen. One of the biggest debates among fans is whether or not the world outside the parks, where Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and other characters ventured toward the end of the second season, is real or just another brilliantly constructed fake landscape that actually (but secretly) extends the territory of the parks.   The show is extremely well done. The acting is excellent and the special effects are arguably the best ever put on the small screen. For many, this show is addictive and fun, but if you lack the fascination with robots and AI that is at the heart of the show, all the special effects in the world won't get you excited about it.


  Two much-awaited series are coming up on Netflix at the end of March.   Deborah Feldman wrote a controversial and critically acclaimed memoir, Unorthodox, about her life in an ultra-Orthodox community and how she eventually fled to Germany with her son, and her book has been adapted for a fictionalized Netflix miniseries, premiering on March 26. The series was directed by Maria Schrader, one of Germany's top actresses, who also directed the adaptation of Zeruya Shalev's acclaimed novel, Love Life, in Israel with an Israeli cast. Israeli Shira Haas plays the lead, and she is one of the most interesting young actresses these days, who has starred - and was the standout - in such television dramas as Shtisel, The Conductor and Harem, and has also appeared in the movies Foxtrot and The Zookeeper's Wife.


  If you got addicted to Ozark, you're not alone, and the good news is that season three will start streaming on Netflix on March 27. There's just something about the Byrdes, a middle-class family drawn into high-level crime, characters who are somehow as appealing as they are amoral, much like with the series Breaking Bad. It has been confirmed that the main cast is returning for the third season and the showrunners have hinted that there will be more character development for Ruth (Julia Garner, whose mother is Israeli and who is starring in a new movie inspired by the Harvey Weinstein scandal, The Assistant), a young redneck woman who, like Marty (Justin Bateman) and Wendy (Laura Linney), is just too smart and tough for the role she born into. Helen Pierce (Janet McTeer), the chillingly efficient lawyer for the drug cartel for which the Byrdes launder money, will also be back, and apparently her daughter will be joining the mix.


  Shia LaBeouf plays a character based on his father in the powerful, semi- autobiographical Honey Boy, for which he also wrote the screenplay.  The movie, which chronicles the actor's often painful childhood and was directed by Israeli Alma Har'el,  who won the Outstanding Directorial Achievement in First-Time Feature Film from the Directors Guild of America. The movie will be shown on CellcomTV, HOT VOD Cinema and YES VOD, starting on March 12.


  There really were no bad seasons of The Americans, but season 5, which starts running on HOT VOD on March 9 and is running on YES Edge in the middle of the night and very early in the morning is quite gripping. It's hard to even talk about the main plot points without spoiling the series for anyone who hasn't seen it, but the main plot of the season has the Jennings investigating possible agricultural sabotage. As always, they do some interesting disguises and Elizabeth even pretends to work in fashion.   It sets everything up for the brilliance of the final season, which contain some of the finest writing, acting and suspense in the history of television.

On the first of every month, when you visit any ATM kiosk, you will read a notice outside the ATM kiosk 'Sorry, ATM is out of order'. What is the use of such facility if it fails to cater to the needs of its customers in a timely manner. Salaried people wait very anxiously for the first of every month because it is the date on which they can withdraw their salaries but all their hopes are dashed to the ground when they have to return empty-handed from the banks. In this period of phenomenal inflation, every salaried person is short of money. They have to pay utility bills. They have to pay the fees of their school/college-going children. They have to provide ration for their families and all this is possible if they receive their payments on time. Those days are long past when people would keep and maintain cheque books to withdraw their payments from the banks. Nowadays, people solely depend on ATMs or debit cards but the way the bank management deals with them is highly cumbersome.


  Bank management must ensure the proper functioning of the ATM booths especially during the salary drawing days. In the same way, enough cash must be kept in ATMs. The onus also lies on the State Bank to issue strict orders to all bank branches to keep ATMs in order across the country. A carrot-and- stick policy should be adopted and bank branches which fail to follow the instructions must be penalized and those that follow the rules must be rewarded. Hopefully, the relevant authorities will take this up on a priority basis and work to find a viable strategy so that people enjoy this facility without any trouble.

The Proteas needed to avoid defeat against the already-eliminated West Indies to top Group B and with the match in Sydney abandoned without a ball being bowled, they earned a point to ensure that happened.


  “I couldn’t have asked for better, our first goal coming here was to get to the semi-finals,” said skipper Dane van Niekerk. “Generally in these tournaments, we’ve lost at crucial times, whereas in this tournament, whenever we’ve been down we’ve got up again. It’s nice that everything is slowly but surely coming together.”


  South Africa have never beaten four-time champions Australia, who suffered a big blow Tuesday with star allrounder Ellyse Perry ruled out of the tournament with a hamstring injury.


  “What better way to do it (beat Australia) than in a World Cup semi-final. We’re not used to the bigger-stage games, but hopefully everything comes together for us,” she added ahead of the match in Sydney on Thursday.


  Group B runners-up England, the 2009 champions, play unbeaten Group A winners India on the same day. Earlier, qualifiers Thailand ended their inaugural World Cup on a high, posting their biggest ever T20 international score before the heavens opened and their clash with Pakistan was also called off.


  They had lost all three of their previous games, with a highest total of 82. But, after winning the toss at Sydney Showground, they stunned Pakistan with their aggressive batting approach, racing to 150 for three off 20 overs.


  Pakistan, who upset 2016 champions West Indies in their opening game before losing the next two, would have needed their record run chase to win but didn’t face a ball.


  “The openers were positive and aggressive and they did very well,” said Thai captain Sornnarin Tippoch. “We had an opportunity to come here and play against the big teams. I think it is good for us. We want to keep doing well. People at home will be happy, same as us. They will be cheering.”


  Natthakan Chantam and Nattaya Boochatham posted the second highest opening partnership of the tournament, 93, before Boochatham fell for 44. Chantam made 56 with some late big-hitting from Nannapat Khoncharoenkai and Chanida Sutthiruang ensuring Thailand passed their previous record of 133 for eight recorded against the Netherlands last year.


  “It gave us the lesson that during cricket no team is bigger or smaller, you have to be on your toes every time,” said Pakistan skipper Javeria Khan, adding that overall the tournament had been positive for her team. “We’ll walk away with our heads held high and our girls played some good cricket.”

Bengaluru, Mar 4 (PTI) The FIBA 3x3 basketball Olympic qualifying tournament, scheduled to be held here from March 18 to 22, was on Wednesday postponed in view of the coronvirus outbreak.


  This is the first sporting event to be put off in India owing to the virus outbreak that has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and infected more than 94000 people across the world after being first detected in Wuhan, China.


  "The FIBA 3x3 Olympic Qualification Tournament, which was scheduled to be held in Bengaluru, India, from March 18 to 22, 2020, has been postponed," Federation Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) said in a statement.


  "FIBA is now working in close collaboration with the International Olympic Committee, on the best solution possible in the circumstances, considering that this tournament needs to take place before the FIBA 3x3 Universality Olympic Qualifier Tournament scheduled to be played in Budapest, Hungary, from April 24 to 26, 2020," it further said.


  Twenty teams each in men's and women's events were to participate in the event jointly organised by FIBA and Basketball Federation of India in a year which will witness the Olympic debut of 3x3 basketball.


  Both the men's and women's teams are broken into four pools each. India are placed in Pool D alongside Latvia, Croatia, Canada and The Netherlands in the men's section while the women find themselves bunched together with Italy, Chinese Taipei, Switzerland and Spain.


  Six Olympic spots (three each from men's and women's) are up for grabs which would then have the top two teams from each pool qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition.


  Former India cricket captain Anil Kumble had launched the logo of the tournament at a function here on Monday.


  The coronavirus outbreak has already seen the postponement of numerous sporting events across the globe, including the World Indoor Track and Field championships, the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix, Moto GP races in Qatar and Thailand and several Serie A football games in Italy.

On the first of every month, when you visit any ATM kiosk, you will read a notice outside the ATM kiosk 'Sorry, ATM is out of order'. What is the use of such facility if it fails to cater to the needs of its customers in a timely manner. Salaried people wait very anxiously for the first of every month because it is the date on which they can withdraw their salaries but all their hopes are dashed to the ground when they have to return empty-handed from the banks. In this period of phenomenal inflation, every salaried person is short of money. They have to pay utility bills. They have to pay the fees of their school/college-going children. They have to provide ration for their families and all this is possible if they receive their payments on time. Those days are long past when people would keep and maintain cheque books to withdraw their payments from the banks. Nowadays, people solely depend on ATMs or debit cards but the way the bank management deals with them is highly cumbersome.

SYDNEY: South Africa will face defending champions Australia in the women's Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals after their match against the West Indies was washed out Tuesday, leaving India to take on England.


  The Proteas needed to avoid defeat against the already-eliminated West Indies to top Group B and with the match in Sydney abandoned without a ball being bowled, they earned a point to ensure that happened.


  "I couldn't have asked for better, our first goal coming here was to get to the semi-finals," said skipper Dane van Niekerk. "Generally in these tournaments, we've lost at crucial times, whereas in this tournament, whenever we've been down we've got up again. It's nice that everything is slowly but surely coming together."


  South Africa have never beaten four-time champions Australia, who suffered a big blow Tuesday with star allrounder Ellyse Perry ruled out of the tournament with a hamstring injury.


  "What better way to do it (beat Australia) than in a World Cup semi-final. We're not used to the bigger-stage games, but hopefully everything comes together for us," she added ahead of the match in Sydney on Thursday.


  Group B runners-up England, the 2009 champions, play unbeaten Group A winners India on the same day. Earlier, qualifiers Thailand ended their inaugural World Cup on a high, posting their biggest ever T20 international score before the heavens opened and their clash with Pakistan was also called off.


  They had lost all three of their previous games, with a highest total of 82. But, after winning the toss at Sydney Showground, they stunned Pakistan with their aggressive batting approach, racing to 150 for three off 20 overs.


  Pakistan, who upset 2016 champions West Indies in their opening game before losing the next two, would have needed their record run chase to win but didn't face a ball.


  "The openers were positive and aggressive and they did very well," said Thai captain Sornnarin Tippoch. "We had an opportunity to come here and play against the big teams. I think it is good for us. We want to keep doing well. People at home will be happy, same as us. They will be cheering."


  Natthakan Chantam and Nattaya Boochatham posted the second highest opening partnership of the tournament, 93, before Boochatham fell for 44. Chantam made 56 with some late big-hitting from Nannapat Khoncharoenkai and Chanida Sutthiruang ensuring Thailand passed their previous record of 133 for eight recorded against the Netherlands last year.


  "It gave us the lesson that during cricket no team is bigger or smaller, you have to be on your toes every time," said Pakistan skipper Javeria Khan, adding that overall the tournament had been positive for her team. "We'll walk away with our heads held high and our girls played some good cricket."

Iraq said a 70-year-old Muslim cleric died on Wednesday from the novel coronavirus, the first death from the outbreak in a country where 31 people have been infected.The Iraqi preacher had been quarantined in the northeastern city of Sulaimaniyah before his death, a spokesman for the Kurdish autonomous region's health authority said.According to local sources, he had recently met with Iraqis returning from neighbouring Iran, which has recorded the third deadliest outbreak outside China, the epidemic's epicentre.Across the world, 3,155 people have died from the virus, with China recording 2,943 deaths, Italy 79 while 77 people have died in Iran from the disease.Iraq is one of Iran's largest export markets and a popular destination for Iranian pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala.Many Iraqis also cross the frontier for business, tourism, medical treatment and religious studies.Iraqi authorities have closed land borders with Iran and banned the entry of foreign nationals travelling from there and other badly affected countries.Schools, universities, cinemas, cafes and other public places in Iraq have been ordered shut until March 7 to further contain the outbreak, but many continue to operate normally.Responding to Wednesday's death, Sulaimaniyah Governor Haval Abu Bakr told reporters that all rallies in the province will be banned and that all football matches will now be held behind closed doors.Local religious authorities for their part announced a ban on mass prayers, including on Fridays, until further notice.The outbreak has fuelled public panic among Iraqis who say the war-ravaged country's healthcare system cannot handle the epidemic.Many hospitals in Iraq are poorly equipped or in disrepair after successive waves of conflict.According to the World Health Organization, there are fewer than 10 doctors for every 10,000 people.

The US conducted Wednesday its first airstrike against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, a military spokesman said, days after signing an ambitious peace deal with the militant group in the Mideastern state of Qatar.


  US military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett said in a tweet that the "defensive" strike was the first US attack against the militants in 11 days. He said the attack was to counter a Taliban assault on Afghan government forces in Nahr-e Saraj in the southern Helmand province.


  Leggett added that Taliban forces had conducted 43 attacks on Afghan troops on Tuesday in Helmand. According to a spokesman for the province's governor, Omer Zwak, at least two police officers were killed and one other wounded in the Washir district of southern Helmand.


  Leggett called on the Taliban to stop the attacks and uphold their commitments based on the agreement signed on Feb. 29 between their leaders and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Doha, Qatar, which lays out a conditions- based path to the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan.


  President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he spoke on the phone to a Taliban leader, making him the first US president believed to have ever spoken directly with the militant group responsible for the deaths of thousands of US troops in nearly 19 years of fighting in Afghanistan.


  The Afghan Defense Ministry said in another statement on Thursday that a Taliban attack on a checkpoint in northern Kunduz province had killed seven of its soldiers.


  The statement said that ten Taliban fighters were killed in the shoot-out.


  Kandahar police spokesman Jamal Naser Barekzai told The Associated Press that a police officer was killed and one wounded in a string of Taliban attacks across the province.


  The Taliban have not claimed responsibility for any of these attacks so far or commented on the US airstrike Wednesday.


  However, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the AP Wednesday that a week of reduction in violence that started midnight on Feb. 21 had ended.


  Based on the US -Taliban deal, peace negotiations between the warring Afghan sides are supposed to begin on March 10. However, the Afghan government has already rejected releasing Taliban prisoners ahead of launching the talks, a precondition which the militants say was part of the US agreement.


  Leggett said that US forces are responsible for defending their Afghan allies according to agreements between US and Afghan governments.
