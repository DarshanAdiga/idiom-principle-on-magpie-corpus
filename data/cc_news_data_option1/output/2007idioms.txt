“It’s a touchy one,” said Grand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg. “You don’t want to be a prosecutor in a tourist town who has to tell people not to come here. But at the same time, we’ve worked really hard to flatten the curve.”
 She’s not the only one concerned.
 “People I’ve talked to said they’ll go out, but they’ll wait until after people from out of town go back home,” Moeggenberg said, adding she has gotten complaints about full hotel parking lots.
 Whitmer’s order allows social gatherings of 10 or less and reopening retail stores, offices, restaurants and bars, provided they limit capacity and adequately space seating.
 It’s not a lifting of Whitmer’s broader Stay Home, Stay Safe order, which was extended Friday to June 12.
 Locals are still urged to remain home as much as possible, and travel within the state is prohibited.
 Those with second homes in northern Michigan are welcome to bunker down at them, but loading the car for an up-north camping trip or trekking to a Traverse City hotel from Detroit remains illegal.
 Violating the order can mean 90 days in jail and up to $500 in fines, and businesses refusing to comply could face licensing issues.
 But enforcement comes in shades of gray.
 “It’s not like we’re going to go around with a ticket book, pulling people over and asking where they’re from,” said Leelanau County Sheriff Mike Borkovich. “A person who’s from Illinois or Ohio might have a cottage up here in Suttons Bay or Gull Lake. How do you know who they are, where they’re going? We don’t have tax records of what they own or what they don’t.”
 Moeggenberg said her biggest concerns are hotels and short-term rentals, but that doesn’t mean licensing challenges are necessarily in store. Without clear guidance on enforcement from the attorney general’s office, she has little direction on how to treat infractions.
 “The onus is not on the hotel owner to say, ‘Why are you staying here?’ It’s on the people who are visiting to follow the guidance,” Moeggenberg said.
 Hotels prepping for weekend crowds are doing what they can to limit contact and keep people safe.
 “We have very stringent guidelines on cleanliness and sanitation,” said Tom Maloney, assistant general manager of the Park Place Hotel in downtown Traverse City.
 Park Place will only rent out a portion of rooms, and common areas like the pool and lounge will stay closed, he added — as directed by the governor. The hotel’s restaurant offers takeout-only options, and stickers along the lobby and near elevators remind guests to keep social distance.
 “I think we’re eager to get back to work, I think people are coming up to enjoy the weekend,” Maloney said. “I think it’s a lot safer and better than it was two or three or four weeks before the lockdown, when there were no guidelines in place.”
 For most, it’s not much of a choice.

 "Looking into the future, we will have to utilise everything we've got, including what we can grow ourselves," said Mr Williams.

 "What we won't be able to afford to do is have a fridge full of premium produce and then, if a member of staff has Covid and the restaurant has to suddenly close, we won't lose it all."
 He added: "What I have discovered during these last few months is how much I love what I do.
 "It's lighting that flame in the kitchen, and nothing is going to beat what I love doing.
 "When we do get back up and running, I'm going to go and say thank you to all the people who have booked tables."

 Our Texas cities have begun to reopen, but many museums have decided to err on the side of caution and remain shuttered a while longer. Many institutions see hundreds or upwards of thousands of visitors on a weekend roaming through their hushed spaces and now want to make sure that they have new protocols in place to ensure everyone has a safe and engaging experience. We're optimistic that soon enough, we'll be able to wander through the galleries of our world- renowned arts institutions again and soak up Vermeers and Van Goghs galore.

 "The Gazette Company has honored Gray Television by entrusting us with the future stewardship of KCRG-TV, which it has built into a true powerhouse," said Hilton H.

 "We realized that we have done all we can do as a single television station with the business and for the people of KCRG TV9,” said Chuck Peters, President and CEO of The Gazette Company. “We look forward to seeing what the very talented KCRG TV9 team can do with the scale and connections of Gray Television."
 Gray will continue to partner with Gazette, however, since the latter owns _The Cedar Rapids Gazette_ , which works with KCRG in the region.

 “Nathan has really come on,” Lober said. “He’s the fastest kid in the school. “The biggest thing with not having a season is these kids didn’t have the chance to make their mark. The whole thing is kind of sad.”
 The cuts drop the Chippewas from 18 sponsored athletic teams to 16, exactly the threshold to remain in the Division 1 Football Bowl Subdivision. CMU is the first school in the state to cut athletic programs, although many around the country have trimmed from their athletic offerings in recent months as revenues shrunk drastically from the pandemic’s financial impact.

 NUEVA YORK (AP) — El gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, eliminó el viernes la prohibición total a reuniones de cualquier tamaño con una orden ejecutiva que estipula que ahora se permite que hasta 10 personas estén en el mismo lugar siempre y cuando se apeguen a otras normas de distanciamiento social adoptadas durante la pandemia de coronavirus.
 La orden, emitida la víspera del fin de semana del Día de los Caídos en Guerras, representa uno de los pasos más grandes que el estado ha dado para levantar las restricciones adoptadas en marzo que prohibían las reuniones de cualquier tipo, excepto a trabajadores esenciales y quienes habiten la misma vivienda.
 La nueva medida no necesariamente allana el camino para los asados en los jardines traseros y los días de campo grupales que son distintivos del feriado. La orden todavía requiere que las personas que se reúnan se apeguen a “protocolos de distanciamiento social, y protocolos de limpieza y desinfección requeridos por el Departamento de Salud”.
 Eso significa que las personas todavía deben mantenerse a una distancia mínima de 1,8 metros (6 pies) unas de otras, o utilizar mascarillas o protectores faciales cuando no puedan mantener esa distancia en público.
 Nueva Jersey adoptó reglas similares y permite grupos de hasta 25 personas al exterior y reuniones al interior de hasta 10 personas. Connecticut ha permitido que los restaurantes con mesas en el exterior presten servicio en el lugar.
 Cuomo ya había aprobado esta semana una orden que permitía reuniones de hasta 10 personas exclusivamente para servicios religiosos y conmemoraciones del Día de los Caídos en Guerras.
 Esa restricción generó una demanda de la Unión de Libertades Civiles de Nueva York (NYCLU), que afirmó que si era seguro reunirse con el objetivo de honrar a los veteranos y para ceremonias religiosas, la Constitución requería que el mismo derecho se extendiera a reuniones por otros motivos.
 La NYCLU presentó la demanda a nombre de la residente de la ciudad de Nueva York Linda Bouferguen, quien según el grupo fue arrestada dos veces afuera del Ayuntamiento por protestar el cierre del estado. La mujer quiere organizar otra protesta el sábado.
 El director legal de NYCLU, Christopher Dunn, dijo en un comunicado que la organización estaba “satisfecha de ver al gobernador dar marcha atrás”.
 El vocero de Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, dijo que la nueva orden se apega a las directrices de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos (CDC), que indican que las reuniones de hasta 10 personas son seguras si mantienen la distancia entre ellas.

 I have worked, lived and played in Gainesville for over 30 years. During that time I have heard much rhetoric from municipal elected officials, city managers, department heads, etc. about how they want us to be No. 1 in the state and a model for cities around the world. Yet, this has yet to come to fruition during that time.
 We have all heard myriad promises made over the years: development of east Gainesville, elimination of chronic homelessness, fiscal responsibility, attention to core services, transparency, increase in well-paying jobs and on and on. While slow progress has been made on some of these promises, others have not moved at all in 30 years.
 So, with all these unfulfilled promises, the city of Gainesville has the distinction of being known for having high utility costs, a high property tax rate, high gasoline costs, high crimes against property for a city our size and other similar distinctions. Are these seriously the items for which you wish to be known?
 Now our elected officials and new city manager are talking about shortcomings in the upcoming budget, while launching a costly program to help businesses and citizens to cope with the global pandemic (GNVCares). This is not a surprise as just last year they chose to raise taxes for pet projects and other items that do not really benefit our standard of living, the divide between east and west, nor our infrastructure.
 Rarely do you hear of the crumbling roads, eroding pipes and other items of maintenance. As a reminder, no positions were cut and individual commissioner projects were not cut during last year's budget meeting (the vote was not unanimous). These people instead have their heads in the clouds, wishing for a utopian dream and cementing their political legacy.
 Then comes a recent City Commission meeting, where they start talking about raising taxes and funding of pet projects. Any reasonable person would also be talking about reduction in revenues, job losses, potential layoffs, decreases in non-essential services and public-private partnerships. Instead we listen to the same old talk and pie-in-the-sky ideas.
 It is time for our elected officials to focus on core service funding in the existing budget first and foremost -- and then some of the other projects can be sprinkled into the mix as funding allows.
 The focus needs to be on the low-hanging budgetary fruit. Why do we need three assistant city managers when other cities our size typically have one? Why do we have positions created on a whim that were not a need and duplicate others duties such as the director of mobility?
 Why hire a city manager with a poor infrastructure record at an excessive cost? Since when is it government's responsibility to fund non-profits too when this need can be filled by individuals and grants? A consolidation of some city and county services needs to be discussed.
 Here we are Gainesville, at a crossroads. Residents are financially strapped during this time and it seems like officials want nothing more than another program that will eat into the budget to provide temporary relief to those affected by our current health crisis. It would not surprise me to see them wanting to make this program permanent with no funding mechanism (just like the Regional Transit System bus replacement program).
 Citizens may not recover as quickly as decisions on higher costs of living are made. I have many colleagues and friends that are considering or have found other places of residence with much lower costs of living, with better infrastructure and just as many parks and other places to visit.
 Hence I see Gainesville reaching No. 1 in the number of people moving out of town, homes on the market and failed businesses.

After two months of being pitted under the yellow flag version of coronavirus, NASCAR's race teams have returned to green flag racing, one of the first professional sports leagues to resume operation.
   
 And while one Gaston County man is among those glad to be back at the race track, he admits it's different racing in front of thousands of empty seats like they'll do this Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
   
 Scott Denton, 54, has been involved in auto racing for the past 17 years. He's spent the last 10 working for Hendrick Motorsports as a member of race teams featuring drivers Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.
   
 He's currently a member of Hendrick's No. 88 team that's led by driver Alex Bowman and crew chief Greg Ives. Denton is the backup driver for the No. 88 race team hauler, but also is a part of the pit crew on race day. As a member of the support crew, he's responsible for throwing the rear air hose and catching the gas can during adrenaline-pumping pit stops that last less than 15 seconds.
   
 Prior to NASCAR stopping racing in mid-March, the 88 team had been on a roll as they were coming off a win March 1 at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Calif. The win was the second career victory for the 27-year-old Bowman, who is in his third full season driving for HMS.
   
 And once racing resumed, the Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet made another strong showing, finishing second in the May 17 race at Darlington (S.C.) Speedway.
   
 "Sunday was awesome, but it was also different," Helton said Wednesday. "It was strange, surreal, but it went well because everybody there did what NASCAR asked us to do."
   
 All of the race team members had to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They had their temperature checked before entering the race track and had to wear a mask and practice social distancing once inside.
   
 "We had to follow all the protocols that NASCAR wanted and HMS wanted," Helton said. "Pretty much all day you had a mask on and gloves and you were six feet apart to keep your distance. It was different because you usually mingle and say 'Hi' to guys, but all you could do basically was just wave at them instead of high-fiving and stuff like that."
   
 The big difference was the quiet and emptiness of the track's grandstands.
   
 "You miss the fans because of the screaming and yelling," Helton said. "When I'm doing my duty, you don't really think about it, but yeah, we miss the fans."
   
 On a typical race week, Denton works Monday through Thursday at the Hendrick Motorsports shop in Concord. He spends his time "turning the tool box around" and "turning the trailer around", which basically means he's going through a six-page checklist and making sure the equipment used on race day is serviced, in place and ready for use.
   
 He's normally off work on Fridays and Saturdays and then flies out to the race track with members of the race team on Sunday. After assisting the pit crew during the race, he drives the hauler back to its shop in Concord.
   
 While they weren't in the shop from mid-March through early May with social distancing restrictions, Denton's days were filled with plenty of video conference meetings through the Microsoft Teams software. Sometimes, there'd be three meetings per day.
   
 He also devoted a large amount of time to mountain biking and doing workout videos at home. With the physical demands of working as part of the pit crew, it was important for the 6-foot-1-inch, 194-pound Denton to stay in shape. The work paid off as he dropped 10 pounds while social distancing.
   
 A 1983 graduate of Ashbrook High School, Denton makes his home in Belmont with his wife, Christyn, and their 6-year-old son, Jack. One benefit of the downtime has been the chance to be at home, Denton said.
   
 "That's a blessing in itself to be able to be home with the family," he said. "It's been a lot of family time."
   
 While currently serving as a backup hauler driver, when he started at Hendrick Motorsports, Denton was the primary driver for Gordon's colorful DuPont transporter and Junior's Mountain Dew-splashed tractor-trailer. He made the switch to a backup driver after he got married in order to spend more time at home.
   
 "When I'm on the road, I'll do a lot of Facetiming, especially on the West Coast trips," Denton said of races at Sonoma, Calif., Las Vegas and Phoenix. The 2,800-mile drive to Sonoma from Concord runs more than 40 hours each way, he said, while Phoenix takes 34 hours.
   
 The drivers follow Department of Transportation regulations that limit them to 11 hours of driving per shift. On the long trips, he and the other driver will often rotate, switching out every 10 hours.
   
 "When you're driving the truck, it's the open road, it's like freedom," said Denton, who says Interstate 10 through southern Arizona is his favorite stretch of road. "It's unbelievable. There are beautiful mountains and scenery you just don't expect to see. If you didn't leave Gastonia or Belmont, you wouldn't think something like that exists."
   
 Racing has long been in Denton's blood. He started out racing super late-model cars at Cherokee Raceway in Gaffney, S.C., with his grandfather, Toy Bolton.
   
 "I love racing in general," Denton said. "I grew up in racing and I was always a race fan growing up. I used to watch those transporters go by and I used to tell my granddad, 'Hey man, I'm going to drive one of those one of these days.' He said, 'Oh, it's a lot of work.'"
   
 Denton's longtime friend, Mark "Hollywood" Armstrong, who was working in auto racing and now works for JR Motorsports, suggested Denton, who was working part-time at FedEx and attending Gaston College, get his commercial driver's license and he would help him land with a race team.
   
 After obtaining his CDL, Denton started out driving a motorhome for race team owner Chip Ganassi and then worked his way up through the ranks, culminating with the offer from Hendrick Motorsports in 2010.
   
 This weekend's trip to Charlotte Motor Speedway is their shortest trip of the year, as it's almost literally across the street from their race shop. The Concord track and race week is a special time for Denton.
   
 "I can bring my family. My son and wife can come to the garage and see what I actually do for a living," he said. "Charlotte's always been special because of that."
   
 However, Charlotte will also be without fans as NASCAR's social distancing restrictions remain in place. Denton will miss having his family there beside him.
   
 He says the fellowship among the racing community is what he likes best about his job.
   
 "I enjoy racing. I enjoy going to victory lane. It's pretty awesome."

Y el ejemplo castellano leones ha sido el de una gestion propia de la mejor lealtad federal, con una atencion rigurosa al asesoramiento experto. El de una comunicacion institucional ejemplar y un cumplimiento extremo, casi mas alla de lo prescrito, de las obligaciones de transparencia. El ejemplo de la movilizacion de los laboratorios de investigacion para incrementar de forma exponencial el numero de test realizados y la fiabilidad de los mismos. El de una prudencia absoluta a la hora de proteger ante todo la vida y la salud de los ciudadanos, frente a cualquier otro calculo. Ha sido el ejemplo del brillante y combativo procurador de Podemos, que tanto ha contribuido en Cortes a velar por la Sanidad publica, haciendo oir ahora en sede institucional su reconocimiento al ejecutivo regional por la labor desempeñada, y el ejemplo de un gobierno y de su oposicion socialista que ya se han puesto a trabajar conjuntamente en los ejes basicos de la recuperacion.

If it completes its acquisition of Cablevision Systems, Altice is expected to try to lower its costs, including programming costs.
 In a research note, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne said Altice did not explicitly mention content savings when talking about how it planned to operate Cablevision. "However, given Altice's track record of focusing on cost, we would expect its combined U.S. footprint (about 3.7 million video subs) will be used to push back on programming costs,” he said.
 Swinburne added that Suddenlink, which Altice agreed to acquire earlier this year, “has already dropped Viacom's networks, a previously unprecedented move in the U.S. media business. For this reason, we view this transaction as a negative for the media business, where we have a Cautious industry view.”
 In Europe, where Altice does business, cable operators have higher profit margins than in the U.S., partly because of content costs and competitive intensity, Swinburne says.
 Analysts note that Altice faces a tough battle growing Cablevision. “We remain concerned with the potential for growth at the Cablevision Systems of both EBITDA and subscribers given the high level penetration of its existing customers into its footprint and the high exposure (53%) to Verizon’s FiOS, a chief competitor,” said Tom Eagan of the Telsey Advisory Group.
 “Altice will face a high bar for cost reduction if they are going to make a go of paying north of 9 [times earnings for Cablevision],” said Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research. “Altice is already guiding to $900M in synergies – slightly higher than the synergies expected to be produced by Charter and Time Warner Cable in a transaction that, by subscribers at least, will be roughly five times larger.”
 Moffett said that kind of cost cutting will be difficult in New York while competing with FiOS. “It will mean slashing customer service; repair and maintenance, and sales and marketing (specifically, channel mix optimization, and back-office upgrades). It’s hard not to imagine that that might have at least some impact on market share,” he said.
 Cablevision CEO James Dolan had previously warned that the MSO could lose big bundle video subscribers to cord cutters and over-the top.
 “To offset that kind of loss of video revenues, Altice will need to grow broadband revenues dramatically. Unfortunately, Cablevision’s broadband subscriber base isn’t growing. So Altice will need to raise prices. A lot. Verizon’s FiOS brand managers must be licking their chops,” Moffett said.

That meant that Ruth—who was primarily a pitcher in the 1917 season, with a 24-13 record, 2.01 ERA and a career-high 35 complete games—had to play more games in the field. Ruth went on to lead the league in home runs that season with 11. Ruth had only hit nine home runs in the previous four seasons and went on to hit 714 home runs in his 22-year career.

I have worked, lived and played in Gainesville for over 30 years. During that time I have heard much rhetoric from municipal elected officials, city managers, department heads, etc. about how they want us to be No. 1 in the state and a model for cities around the world. Yet, this has yet to come to fruition during that time.
   
 We have all heard myriad promises made over the years: development of east Gainesville, elimination of chronic homelessness, fiscal responsibility, attention to core services, transparency, increase in well-paying jobs and on and on. While slow progress has been made on some of these promises, others have not moved at all in 30 years.
   
 So, with all these unfulfilled promises, the city of Gainesville has the distinction of being known for having high utility costs, a high property tax rate, high gasoline costs, high crimes against property for a city our size and other similar distinctions. Are these seriously the items for which you wish to be known?
   
 Now our elected officials and new city manager are talking about shortcomings in the upcoming budget, while launching a costly program to help businesses and citizens to cope with the global pandemic (GNVCares). This is not a surprise as just last year they chose to raise taxes for pet projects and other items that do not really benefit our standard of living, the divide between east and west, nor our infrastructure.
   
 Rarely do you hear of the crumbling roads, eroding pipes and other items of maintenance. As a reminder, no positions were cut and individual commissioner projects were not cut during last year's budget meeting (the vote was not unanimous). These people instead have their heads in the clouds, wishing for a utopian dream and cementing their political legacy.
   
 Then comes a recent City Commission meeting, where they start talking about raising taxes and funding of pet projects. Any reasonable person would also be talking about reduction in revenues, job losses, potential layoffs, decreases in non-essential services and public-private partnerships. Instead we listen to the same old talk and pie-in-the-sky ideas.
   
 It is time for our elected officials to focus on core service funding in the existing budget first and foremost -- and then some of the other projects can be sprinkled into the mix as funding allows.
   
 The focus needs to be on the low-hanging budgetary fruit. Why do we need three assistant city managers when other cities our size typically have one? Why do we have positions created on a whim that were not a need and duplicate others duties such as the director of mobility?
   
 Why hire a city manager with a poor infrastructure record at an excessive cost? Since when is it government's responsibility to fund non-profits too when this need can be filled by individuals and grants? A consolidation of some city and county services needs to be discussed.
   
 Here we are Gainesville, at a crossroads. Residents are financially strapped during this time and it seems like officials want nothing more than another program that will eat into the budget to provide temporary relief to those affected by our current health crisis. It would not surprise me to see them wanting to make this program permanent with no funding mechanism (just like the Regional Transit System bus replacement program).
   
 Citizens may not recover as quickly as decisions on higher costs of living are made. I have many colleagues and friends that are considering or have found other places of residence with much lower costs of living, with better infrastructure and just as many parks and other places to visit.
   
 Hence I see Gainesville reaching No. 1 in the number of people moving out of town, homes on the market and failed businesses.

Gray Television said this week it would close its deal to buy KCRG-TV for $100 million by fourth-quarter 2015 "following receipt of FCC and other approvals." It already has one of those, a clean bill of competitive health from the Justice Department.
 Gray announced Tuesday that it had closed on its purchase of the station's nonlicense assets, which means the deal had been in the works for some time, enough time to submit it to the relevant agencies.
 At $100 million, the deal was large enough to need a Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust review from either the Federal Trade Commission or Justice. They don't say which has done it, but TV station deals are almost always by DOJ.
 The FTC this week signaled that the Gray-Gazette deal had gotten early termination of its review, which means the government found was no reason to block it or seek conditions on antitrust grounds
 The FCC must still give its thumbs up or down based on a broader public interest standard, but they usually coordinate their reviews so that is a good sign for a thumbs up from the FCC.
