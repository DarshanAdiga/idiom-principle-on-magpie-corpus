Thanks very much. Let me ask you a couple of questions on ARPU, if I can. First off, if you're down another CAD60 million year-over-year in the third quarter on overage revenue, correct me if I'm wrong, you should be basically at zero by then should you not so that -- so that this will stop being such a big headwind as the crisis and then the migration to unlimited gotten you down to sub 1% of service revenue coming from overage now?

And Jeff on the wireless retail environment, as I said in the last part of June, early part of July, we've seen a lot of good retail traffic and we've had some volume days that are reminiscent of sale periods in the back half of the year as a whole. Mall traffic has been good given the circumstances. I would say to you that, our factory capacity is down a bit just because of the conditions we're employing to keep customers safe and hygiene, intact, etc. Think of it this way. Depending on the size of the store footprint, we limit the number of people in the store. So, in some of the mall locations, we actually have line-ups and people kind of come in as one person, goes out. Just of the nature of COVID right now, we have to work through that sort of trade-off. So, at the end of the day, our goal is to continue to execute well on the physical bricks-and-mortar side. And as I recall, we have a strong advantage on that front with 2,500 locations across the country.

Drew, on the 5G, I'll make a few comments and Jorge Fernandes, our CTIO is here with us. So I'm going to ask him to help support with some commentary. So on 5G, it's full steam ahead in terms of our focus and development of 5G. As you know, we're the first to launch. And we also have a very advantageous position with 600 megahertz spectrum across the country. And Jorge will talk about the deployment plans on that spectrum. And, yes, the 3,500 megahertz auction regrettably has been delayed. But bear in mind that we have other spectrum available to us in the mid-range frequency and Jorge will kind of cover our plans on that front including the tranche of 3,500 megahertz we already own.

Hi, Batya. I'll take the churn question and I will ask Tony to cover the capex question. On the churn front, no question. We've seen a massive improvement in churn this quarter and going from 0.99% postpaid churn wireless to 0.77%, I mean, that's not sustainable in an open market as a whole. Yes, we will continue to improve churn because we've been on that path for the last few years. We'll continue to see the right sort of march to better churn over time, which is great. But also bear in mind that gross additions were down as I said earlier for us about 38% or 135,000 year-over-year. So, as gross additions come back, we'll see more froth in the marketplace and therefore churn will get back to that normal, improving trajectory that we've seen in the last few years. But it's just not sustainable at 0.77%, in that range outside of COVID.

A group of parents on Wednesday gathered in front of a private school in Kolkata’s Park Street, held posters and raised slogans. The parents said that since the school was not open, they did not want to pay the full school fees for their wards studying in the school. Several private schools in Kolkata, and in other towns and suburbs of the State, have witnessed similar protests over several months since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic forced educational institutions to close down.
 The protests on Wednesday came after two developments on Tuesday. A group of parents had approached the Calcutta High Court demanding appropriate discounts on account of reduced costs in the running of the schools over the last four months. The Calcutta HC had on Tuesday directed that the outstanding dues of each student, as on July 31, had to be cleared to the extent of 80% by August 15. The Court also directed that none of the 112 schools involved should discontinue making online courses available to any of their students, or prevent them from participating in online examinations, unconditionally, till August 15.

It's fair to say that outside of COVID, it was going to happen in the Q3 period. COVID has made that a little more complicated because of the additional pressure on the overage that we talked about. So, all things being equal -- all things being equal, yes. The question, if your hesitation is, I don't know what's going to happen with COVID in the second half of this year, right. I'm looking at what's happening in different parts of the US economy with -- I said the seesaw around, let's go out, let's come back in, etc. I don't know how that's going to play into this dynamic. But if we were to hold the current conditions constant, absolutely we see coming out of this, somewhere in the Q3, Q4 time period, as we've said before.

While representing less than 15% of our revenue and less than 3% [Phonetic] of our total adjusted EBITDA, our Sports and Media business saw the most pressure in Q2. The material loss of advertising revenue with the suspension of live sports affected the entire industry, including Sportsnet. The lack of game day revenue and in-stadium promotions from delayed Blue Jays baseball also contributed to a tough quarter. Similar to Wireless and Cable, we are seeing some positive signs. With live sports scheduled to come back, advertisers are calling, eager to participate in the return of live sports. Our sports and broadcasting resources are an incredibly valuable set of assets and their contributions to our business will recover gradually with this pent-up demand for sports entertainment. Live sports, above all other types of content, drives a loyal and permanent appetite by fans and audiences.

And on the question of the funding, Maher, we did qualify for and received some funding for our media business that essentially ground to a halt. And we availed ourselves with that funding for the reasons you'd expect. So, the choices were to either furlough employees and have them go on individual subsidy or to keep employees here, take advantage of that support mechanism, trying to figure out in anticipation of when the games might resume. And I think that trade-off worked out well for us because the games now are coming and they're all coming at once fast and furiously and having few people on standby and ready versus having to call them back from furlough was an advantage to us as a whole. So it was really kind of a -- think of it as a flow-through either would have happened directly for individuals or as a flow through by keeping them ready for the games to come.

Britain’s government announced Wednesday that it will open a new special pathway to obtaining U.K. citizenship for eligible Hong Kongers as of January, taking another step toward solidifying a policy denounced by China.
 In a statement, the Home Office said holders of the British National Overseas passport and their immediate family members can move to the U.K. to work and study. The change to immigration rules was introduced after Beijing imposed a new, sweeping national security law on Hong Kong.
 "Today’s announcement shows the U.K. is keeping its word. We will not look the other way on Hong Kong, and we will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.

Just a few comments before we go. I think it's important to bear in mind this is the way we look at the business. There's a solid business with a strong and resilient base of recurring revenue. I mean, in Wireless, 90% of the revenue is in that strong recurring base. We spent a lot of time today talking about the 10%, the vast majority of which is impacted by COVID and will recover [Technical Issues] being one and activation fees being another, but it will recover over time. And as I said earlier, we're making our way through the curve on unlimited and the overage amount roughly to the same schedule that we discussed overall. So, it's a solid business, strong base of recurring revenue in Wireless.
