The former Leeds forward steered home a Borna Barisic cross in the 50th minute as Rangers improved on last weekend’s goalless draw with Livingston. However, a bizarre kit blunder meant that he celebrated his first strike for the club with his name misspelled as “Roffe” on the back of his shirt.

Kautilya’s Arthsastra acknowledges and emphasises the need of “labh”, profit for sustenance of a business enterprise. Profit, according to Indian Dharmasastras, is a legitimate return for taking risk in business. That means “higher the risk, higher the profit” was an accepted norm.

The Celtic manager Lennon said: “We got our just rewards, it was a great performance and great win. The only disappointing thing is the scoreline – we should have won the game very comfortably. So you have to credit Dundee United or [Benjamin] Siegrist in goal who made a couple of great saves. We were a little bit loose in the final third but the performance was really good … I don’t think we’re hitting top form just yet … We deserved even better out of the game but we’ll take the win.”

“It’s just an unusual year as far as how guys were going to stay in shape, and some guys were in better shape than others,” Gase said. “At the end of the day nothing replaces this environment because of the competition — you’re fighting for a job . . . I mean, that’s real. Everybody has to get in shape as fast as possible.”

"Business has been terrible," she said, "I've sold one scarf, it's pointless being here".
 Around the corner in Figuiera Square, a shop sells official football merchandise, focused on the Portugal national team and their star player Cristiano Ronaldo.
 They too have seen no impact from the presence of eight top teams playing in the capital in recent days.
 "The people didn't visit us to see the game. Maybe next year the world will be much better," said shop assistant Jose Martino.
 Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa had encouraged fans and tourists to visit the country but his appeal appears to have fallen on deaf ears.
 The buzz of a Champions League final will certainly be felt in Munich and the French capital, however.
 In Paris, the Champs Elysee avenue will be pedestrianised on Sunday evening although wearing face masks will be compulsory, officials said on Saturday.
 Bayern's players, like their opponents locked in a secure 'bubble' of hotel and training facilities, wrote an open letter to their supporters in an attempt to keep the connection with the fans.
 "We know you'll be supporting us at home with all your heart during this final - no matter where you are. Whether in Lisbon, Munich or elsewhere in the world, we see our club as a family, and so we're going into this huge game with you by our side," the players wrote on the club's website.
 Despite the absence of fans in the stadium, the mini-tournament to finish off the delayed season has produced exciting football throughout and PSG's French forward Kylian Mbappe said there was still a special feeling to the game.
 "Of course, it feels strange to play behind closed doors but it's still the Champions League. You can feel it the intensity of the matches, the tension that reigns," he said.
 A thriller is expected between the German and French champions - such a pity that no fans will be able to witness it.

Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden said he would listen to government scientists on the coronavirus — even if it means shutting the country down.
 “I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus. That is the fundamental flaw of this administration’s thinking to begin with,” the former vice president told ABC News on Friday. “I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.”
 President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged state and local governments to ease Covid-related restrictions on schools and businesses in order to boost the economy.
 In an interview to be broadcast Sunday, Biden also denied Trump’s charge that he would defund police departments, as some Black Lives Matter activists have proposed in the wake of police killings of Black citizens.
 “First of all, there has to be national standards that in fact apply to every police department in the country,” Biden said. “I don’t want to defund police departments. I think they need more help. They need more assistance. We have to make it clear that this is about protecting neighborhoods. Protecting people, everybody, across the board.”
 Biden spoke to ABC News in his first joint broadcast interview with his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, the day after accepting the Democratic party’s nomination for president.
 Harris brushed off insults from the incumbent president, who has called her “nasty,” a “madwoman” and the “meanest” U.S. senator for her treatment of Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.
 “There is so much about what comes out of Donald Trumps mouth that is designed to distract the American people from what he is doing every day, that is about neglect, negligence and harm to the American people,” Harris said.
 “And incompetence,” Biden added. “The idea that he would say something like that. No president has ever said anything like that. No president has ever used those words.”
