"I'm very excited for her, and to turn down Division-I scholarship offers, that lets you know what kind of a kid she is," St. Pauls coach Mike Moses said. "She was stern about what she wanted; she wanted to be close to home, she wanted to be in a program that was established and winning, she wanted a coaching staff where she had a good relationship. And she wanted to go to an HBCU, so she got everything she needed, and I'm proud of her."

WASHINGTON — An obscure South Carolina company may be in line for millions of dollars in U.S. government funding to produce a coronavirus treatment after a former Republican senator with a financial stake in the business lobbied senior U.S. government officials.
 Plasma Technologies LLC has received seed money to test a possible COVID-19 fighting blood plasma technology. But as much as $65 million more could be on the way — a windfall for the company that operates out of the founder's luxury condo in Charleston — according to internal government records and other documents obtained by The Associated Press.
 The story of how a tiny business, which exists only on paper, has managed to snare so much top-level attention is emblematic of the Trump administration's frenetic response to the coronavirus pandemic.
 And it's another in a series of contracts awarded despite concerns over their proposals voiced by government scientists. The others include a $21 million study of the heartburn drug Pepcid as a COVID therapy, and more than a half- billion dollars to ApiJect Systems America, a startup with an unapproved medicine injection technology and no factory to manufacture the devices. In addition, a government whistleblower claimed that a $1.6 billion vaccine contract to Novavax Inc. was made over objections of scientific staff.
 At the center of these deals is Dr. Robert Kadlec, a senior Trump appointee at the Department of the Health and Human Services, who backed the Pepcid, Novavax and ApiJect projects. Records obtained by the AP also describe Kadlec as a key supporter of Plasma Tech, owned by Eugene Zurlo, a former pharmaceutical industry executive and well-connected Republican donor who lives in Charleston. Three years ago, Zurlo brought Rick Santorum, who spent 12 years as a GOP senator from Pennsylvania, aboard as a part-owner.
 Kadlec has come under pressure from the White House to act with more urgency and not be bound by lower-level science officials whom Trump has castigated as the "deep state" and accused of politically motivated delays in fielding COVID-19 vaccines and remedies.
 The AP reached out to more than a dozen blood plasma industry leaders and medical experts. Few had heard of Zurlo's company or its technology for turning human plasma into protein-rich antibody therapies, and would not comment.
 In an email, Zurlo told the AP that the shortage of plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients, which is needed to make these therapies, underlines the need for the technology he's patented to harvest as many of these proteins as possible.

"She had so much potential to achieve whatever she wanted to in life; she had such a fabulous personality and we are devastated she is no longer with us.
 "Our school community has been rocked to the core by Jessica’s tragic death and we will work with our students to create a fitting tribute in memory of her life."
 Her teachers paid tribute to the popular student who had a "real zest for life".
 Mr Sievewright, who knew the teenager well, said: "Jess was larger than life, she would light up a room and she lived for the moment. She was bright, articulate, infectious through her personality, her confidence and laughter, and had a real zest for life. Jess was, and will always be remembered as, a character.
 "Jess was always passionate about what she liked and believed in, from issues in society, TikTok, and her take on school uniform!"

I have to say it probably wasn't a great interview, but ever since then I have not been intimidated of anyone I've spoken with."

Being black is who God made me to be. Being black is who I am: Not better than anyone else, but simply who I am. And I want you to know that being black does not make me any less of a person, or diminish my value as a person. As a black person in America, my life matters and should be valued equally. And although being black is who I am, through conversations with the Lord, I also understand that I am much more than that. (Meaning some people only see the color of person but not who an individual really is). I am a man of God and that’s what’s most important in my eyes.

Which leads me to make the point: What is asked of black Americans and has always been unspoken but true is that I or anyone who looks like me doesn’t have the margin for error not to be perfect within a system not built for us to survive. When I wore Taylor on the back of my jersey I thought that could been me. I thought me being a black American, must I and others feel we have to be superhuman to see the blessing of tomorrow? I also know that no one in America—in particularly black Americans—should be forced to live under the unmerited pressure of being perfect. It's not sustainable, especially if we want future generations to grow up to reach their full potential and to thrive in a country which claims to uphold the ideal that everyone is entitled to the equal pursuit of life, liberty and happiness.

Growth Catalysts
 _Lennox International, Inc. in the Time of Pandemic_
 As the pandemic struck different industries, almost all of the companies in the US felt its scourge and Lennox was not an exemption. From the decline in sales and earnings in 1Q 2020 due to its divestitures, the pandemic came a few weeks later. The impact was keenly felt during 2Q but the company remained sound, given the potentially drastic decrease in sales and earnings was prevented. Although the values were lower compared to the previous year, both sales and earnings remained within the range and remained adequate to keep its operations intact and firm. In 3Q, the company proved the line "Comeback is real."
 Sales and earnings grew again which gave an offsetting effect to the decrease during the first half although the accumulated amount remained lower. Everything is slowly adapting to the situation; the employment is going up again and the company has coped with it fully. Given this, the company is expected to do better during the fourth quarter. The increasing purchasing power and the current situation where many still work in the comfort of their homes may give upward pressure on the demand for its products. The adaptability of the company and its strategic operations may increase sales and earnings in 4Q. Further growth is expected as everything has fully adapted and gone back to normal.
 _Feel the Love Program_
 Through its Feel the Love Program, Lennox International, Inc. honors those who are going through physical, mental, and social disabilities and those who inspire through military and community service. Now, the company honors those who serve in the front line such as the medical workers and the security forces. Since its creation more than a decade ago, the program has become successful and helped a lot of people.
 With this, the program may entice benefactors, public and private institutions, and other companies to make partnerships or attract investments for this program. It may stimulate the company's operations that may also increase the frequency and impact of this initiative. Hence, it may help the company receive more popularity, partnerships, demand, and even investments that may cause further growth in the long run.
