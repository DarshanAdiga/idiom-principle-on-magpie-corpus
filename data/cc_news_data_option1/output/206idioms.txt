It didn't help that my mom, dad, brother, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins were all lean and could eat whatever they wanted. And then there was me. I couldn't help but compare myself, and I didn't understand why I was so different.
 My mom tried to help. She had my thyroid tested and had me meet with various therapists and nutritionists. At the end of the day, her idea of helping was to put me (and only me) on a so-called diet. I'd watch my little brother eat McDonald's, while I had to eat Subway. He could eat Gardetto's, Pringles, and Gushers for snacks, while I was forced to eat yogurt and baby carrots.
 I developed a very unhealthy relationship with food. I'd binge at friends' houses, buy snacks with my own money, hide them in my room, and get yelled at when empty containers of Oreos were found under my bed.
 Fast-forward to college where I had access to unlimited food in the cafeteria and started binge-drinking four days out of the week, and the weight piled on fast.

_"we are confident that with continued iteration and feedback, privacy- preserving and open-standard mechanisms like the Privacy Sandbox can sustain a healthy, ad-supported web"_
 Um, no, because those goals are diametrically opposed. As long as ads are targeted, privacy cannot be preserved.
 But really, the concept of an "ad supported web" is the problem. A few companies have now made the experiment, and discovered that blasting ads onto the Internet does not actually buy them anything. FWIW, I can anecdotally support this: I used to run an AdWords account for a small company. We tried various strategies for 2-3 years. The only inquiries we got, were inquiries that we didn't want. It was useless, a complete waste of money.
 Personally, I believe the only people who think ads on the Internet work are people whose jobs depend on them working. Stop internet advertising, fire all the marketing types who buy the ads, sell the ads, produce the ads. No one would notice a difference, except for the marketeers standing in the soup line. Oh, and companies like Google, who would have to find some other way to fund themselves.

Following an uproar over the vote, Salvini, a Euroskeptic and immigration hawk, said he saw Segre's motion as a way to limit free speech and censor "the right to say 'Italians first.'" He said that he too is the target of many threats on social media.
 But Salvini also said contemporary antisemites are "mentally ill," and that he is not minimizing the problem.
 This week, he held his event titled "The New Forms of Antisemitism," featuring remarks by Eydar, Gold, British intellectual Douglas Murray, and President of the Italian Senate Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati among others.
 Gold said after the event that that it was an "important meeting," because "Salvini as a national figure in Italy taking on antisemitism is a big deal."
 "He sets a tone now for conservative politics across Europe. That is something I hope others imitate," he added.
 Gold recounted that when he was director-general of the Foreign Ministry, there were constant deliberations about Israeli relations with far-right parties in Europe like the League.
 "What I feel is that when somebody shows friendship for our most fundamental interests, we have to reciprocate," he stated. "When I got the request to come to Salvini's seminar, I immediately said yes. I think that will help promote more sympathetic views of Israel and our most important interests in future contacts with Europe.
 "Imagine if he goes out on a limb and no one from Israel comes. That would be terrible," Gold said.
 Similarly, Eydar said it is important to Israel that as many countries as possible adopt the IHRA definition and he went to encourage it.
 Salvini and Eydar tied anti-Israel sentiment to antisemitism in their addresses, a theme found in the IHRA definition, which includes comparing Israel to Nazis or denying Jews self-determination, among other examples.
 "Those who want to wipe out Israel have us as opponents, now and always," Salvini stated. "Those who want it to be destroyed are antisemitic and should be challenged."
 The Italian opposition leader lamented: "We have an EU that denies its Judeo- Christian roots and labels Israeli products, a UN that in 2018 condemned Israel with 18 resolutions but did not adopt even one against Iran."
 Eydar said the Jewish people "cannot exist without a political and a sovereign center, our homeland."
 "The State of Israel is the insurance policy of all Jews in the world. Anti- Zionism means to oppose our full existence. Anyone who opposes the existence of the Jewish state is antisemitic," he said.
 In his remarks at the event, Gold gave an overview of antisemitism throughout the from antiquity, through the Middle Ages and modern times.
 "Today its form is changing again. Anyone with eyes in his head can see that in recent years there has been a veritable explosion in the number of antisemitic incidents…in the heart of Western civilization," he said.
 Gold called to combat antisemitism from the "Red-Green Alliance," including Iranian influence around the world. He also pointed to connections between European NGOs and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, recognized as a terrorist organization in Europe.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — An air ambulance crashed while taking off at a major fishing port city in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, municipal officials said Thursday. A LifeMed medevac aircraft with three people crashed about 8 a.m. after taking off from the Unalaska Airport, acting city manager Marjie Veeder said in a news release. The aircraft ended up in the ocean between the end of the runway and Hog Island in Unalaska Bay. The three people on board were picked up and taken to the Iliuliuk Family and Health Services Clinic, Veeder said. There was no immediate word on the nature of their injuries Unalaska is home to Dutch Harbor, the largest fishing port in the nation by volume of seafood landed. The crash is the second at the airport in three months. A commuter airplane carrying 42 people, including a high school swim team, went off the runway Oct. 18 and came to a rest just short of the Bering Sea. One man was killed in the crash. The crash occurred as the pilot made a second attempt to land on the runway. Parts of a propeller blade pierced the cabin. Unalaska is about 825 miles (1,330 kilometers) west of Anchorage.

 Pennsylvania's most significant recent hunting developments have been all about weekends.
 How do the commonwealth's hunters and other residents feel about hunting on Saturday and Sunday? It's a question that Pennsylvania Game Commission officials and state legislators dealt with throughout 2019.
 Eventually, the PGC voted to open deer firearms season on a Saturday, ending a 55-year tradition of Monday opening days.
 Later in the year, state legislators passed a bill that allows for hunting on three Sundays beginning in 2020, and Gov. Tom Wolf signed the bill into law. That broke another long tradition of Sunday being off limits for Pennsylvania's big-game hunters.
 The first Saturday opener took place Nov. 30. As a Pennsylvania hunter for almost 40 years, I was initially skeptical. After the first year, though, I'm a cautious supporter.
 Admittedly, I have a self-interest in the change because I shot a nine-point buck on the morning of the opening Saturday.
 My initial skepticism was based on breaking more than 50 years of tradition. My hunting camp had a number of weekend rituals before each Monday opener. Plus, we had out-of-state hunters who had to travel long distances to camp.
 However, we adjusted our camp schedule and didn't experience too much disruption.
 Travis Lau, the Pennsylvania Game Commission's press secretary, said that early feedback from hunters about the Saturday opener varied from region to region.
 He said PGC regional offices that received negative feedback were often in places where hunters had to travel to camps.
 Some regions reported more hunters in the woods, and others reported less hunting pressure.
 The PGC's original motivation behind the change to a Saturday opener was the hope that it would lure younger hunters and stop the decades-long exodus of licensed hunters.
 Lau said the license sales through December were down 0.4 percent from the previous year, and even though that was a drop, it was a smaller drop than recent years.
 The Pennsylvania Game Commission will meet Jan. 25 in Harrisburg, where it will listen to more comments from the public. In March, the PGC's deer harvest report will be ready for analysis to measure how the Saturday change might have affected the deer kill and key demographics, including younger hunters.
 As it awaits the findings, the Game Commission has scheduled a 2020 Saturday opener on the draft agenda for the January meeting. Although it's a preliminary schedule, that's an early sign that Saturday openers might continue.
 The PGC also has tentatively scheduled Sunday hunting for three consecutive weekends in late November to include deer archery season, bear season and buck season.
 One year from now, the PGC is sure to be doing a second evaluation to see if hunters supported Sunday hunting.

Wrestling is coming back to Hiram College.  
 Athletic Director Todd Hibbs announced Friday the board of Hiram College approved plans to revive the Terriers' men's wrestling program, as well as establishing a new women's wrestling program.  
 Hibbs noted he had been thinking about reviving wrestling at Hiram since he was first hired as athletic director in May.  
 "At different places I had been, we had resurrected the wrestling programs there," Hibbs said. "I just started to receive calls from alumni and from people who supported wrestling. My hope was to be able to add it within the first year of my time here. We set a drop dead date of Feb. 1 in order to be able to wrestle next winter."  
 "I'm very grateful to the alumni for support they have given," Hibbs said. "We've got a lot of work to do."  
 The Terriers plan to compete in men's wrestling in time for the 2020-21 season and a search for a head men's wrestling coach/director of wrestling operations will begin immediately.  
 Hibbs said he would like to have the position filled "sometime during the month of February."  
 "We'd like to have that person named by the time the OHSAA wrestling postseason starts," Hibbs said. "I've received many phone calls and e-mails from people interested in the position."  
 Hibbs noted the position has not been officially posted by the college, but will be "no later than next week" on Hiram.edu and NCAAJobs.com  
 "I think we will get a broad range of candidates," Hibbs said. "We'll have a committee on campus, similar to what we did when we hired a new football coach. It will be an exciting."  
 Hibbs said the men's coach will hire a graduate assistant to help to coach the men's program and then aid him in hiring the women's coach during the fall of 2020. The women's program is expected to begin competing in 2021-22.  
 Hibbs noted Hiram will join Tiffin University as the only Ohio-based women's college wrestling program. He noted starting a women's program is partially strategic, as starting the women's program will bring Hiram into compliance with Title IX gender-equity rules along with reviving the men's program.  
 However, Hibbs notes bringing in women's wrestling will also keep Hiram "ahead of the curve."  
 "It's just such a fast growing sport right now," Hibbs said. "We will be only the second women's collegiate program in the state of Ohio. I'm excited to get in front.  
 "We'll recruit from everywhere." he added. "The reason for adding women a little bit later is, when we reviewed the number of wrestlers in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, there was something like 40,000 boys wrestling, but only 2,500 girls.  
 "We were not confident that we could hire a women's coach at this late a time and be able to recruit a full team. We'll use the entire 2020 season to do so."  
 Hibbs has plenty of background in wrestling. An All-American at the University of Mount Union, Hibbs served as an assistant coach at Michigan State University before reviving the NCAA Division III programs at Olivet College and Alma College in Michigan.  
 The addition of men's wrestling re-establishes a program that previously ran from 1954 to 1987 at Hiram. Ten Terriers earned Division III All-America honors. Hiram will be the third member of the North Coast Athletic Conference to support wrestling.  
 Hibbs noted the college is receiving private funding from outside the college to cover the start-up costs for the program.  
 "We wanted to raise the funds to hire our coaching staff, purchase new mats and purchase the equipment we need to get the program going," Hibbs said. "We wanted to raise those funds so that it cost the university is $0 dollars to start. Until [the wrestlers] come in the fall, we don't see any return on our investment."  
 Hibbs said he was not ready to release amounts donated or the names of those who had donated to support the program, noting such disclosures could come when the new men's coach is named.  
 "We're still having conversations with the lead donors," Hibbs said. "Some people have been really generous. There have been efforts to bring back wrestling to Hiram in the past that have come up just short."  
 Within three years, Hiram hopes to have full teams for wrestling, including 35 to 40 male wrestlers and 25 to 30 female wrestlers.  
 "We're confident we can get to both those numbers," Hibbs said. "A lot of wrestlers make their college decisions for Division III in the months of March April and May. We're confident we can get 15 to 20 guys for next year."  
 Hibbs said he wants to concentrate on building from local communities, as he is aware of the strength of wrestling in Portage County.  
 "When you think about high school wrestling, there are three places everyone talks about: The Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh area and Northeast Ohio," Hibbs said. "We will no doubt dig in here in Northeast Ohio and Portage County is a big part of that. This will be the backbone of our school. We'll be after all those student-athletes."

CNN) -- The third Senate impeachment trial of a US president in history convened on Thursday with the swearing in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts as well as all present members of the US Senate.
 Earlier Thursday, the seven House impeachment managers who will prosecute the case against the President marched the articles from the House to the Senate, beginning the ceremonial functions of the impeachment trial in which senators will decide whether Trump should be removed from office.
 LIVE UPDATES: The latest on President Trump's impeachment
 House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and the lead impeachment manager, read the articles in the chamber shortly after noon ET. Roberts was sworn in shortly after 2 p.m. ET. After Roberts swore in the senators, each member of the chamber came forward and signed the oath book on the floor of the Senate.
 The outcome of the trial is all but determined, as the two-thirds vote required to remove the President would need 20 Republican senators to break ranks. But that doesn't mean the trial itself won't have twists and turns — and potentially some surprises — as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell navigates the demands of his Senate conference, pressures from Democrats and the whims of Trump and his Twitter account.
 Already this week, indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas has upended the impeachment conversation by providing the House Intelligence Committee with a trove of evidence about his work with Giuliani's efforts to oust former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch last spring and then pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
 And the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, said Thursday that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld Ukraine security aid that Congress has appropriated.
 That evidence is likely to be incorporated into the House Democratic case against the President, which they will begin presenting next Tuesday when the substance of the trial gets underway. Democrats charge that Trump withheld the security aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine while pushing for an investigation into the Bidens.
 On Thursday, the Senate dispensed with the ceremonial functions of the impeachment trial.
 The House impeachment managers began the proceedings by reading aloud the two articles of impeachment on the floor of the Senate. It was the second time they took the articles from the House to the Senate — the managers took the same walk on Wednesday to notify the Senate of the articles, in an odd bit of ceremonial flair that comes with an impeachment trial of the President.
 Next Tuesday, the Senate is expected to vote on a resolution setting the rules of the trial, and then arguments will get underway.
 The trial is only beginning this week after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi withheld the formal sending of the articles for four weeks while Democrats pushed for Republicans to agree to calling witnesses and obtaining new documents for the trial.
 Pelosi said at her weekly press conference Thursday that Senate Republicans are "afraid of the truth," when asked what her response is to Senate Republicans who say they shouldn't have to consider new evidence like the Parnas material because it wasn't included in the House investigation.
 "They don't want to see documents, they don't want to hear from eyewitnesses," Pelosi said. "They want to ignore anything new that comes up."
 McConnell has rejected the Democratic demands, saying the question of witnesses should be taken up after the House and the President's legal team make their opening arguments. Republicans are expected to pass the rules to put off the question of witnesses without Democratic votes.
 McConnell on Thursday criticized Pelosi on the Senate floor for distributing souvenir pens while signing the impeachment articles on Wednesday.
 "Nothing says seriousness and sobriety like handing out souvenirs, as though this were a happy bill-signing instead of the gravest process in our Constitution," he said.

HIGHLAND — The future of the Highland Scotties women's basketball team remains uncertain after carefully controlled discussions over the course of four hours on Wednesday produced no official action.
 The Highland Community College Board of Trustees assembled at the David Reist Administration Building of the HCC main campus in Highland. Board Chairman Tom Smith requested a motion to enter into closed-door executive session, which carried on a 5-0 vote. Behind closed doors, the board proceeded to hear from each member of the basketball coaching staff, beginning with Second Assistant Coach Jered Ross, continuing with First Assistant Coach Brad Zinn, and concluding with Head Coach William "BJ" Smith.
 Each coach spoke with the board for an extended period, one at a time. None of the coaches spoke with support from any assistants, colleagues or representatives, and HCC human resources manager Eileen Gronniger, who prepares the board's official minutes for the public record, also didn't attend. However, Smith arrived and departed with a large tote, apparently containing documents. He made no statement outside the meeting room.
 The coaches are believed to be on indefinite paid leave following the recent manifestation of certain complaints to the National Junior Collegiate Athletics Association (NJCAA), which governs all sports operations for junior colleges like Highland. Assistant Coach Jon Oler of the Scotties men's basketball team is steering the women's basketball program in place of Smith.
 College President Deborah Fox declined to comment in any respect after the board finished its business, and wouldn't say whether or not the coaches remained on leave as of Wednesday night.
 The nature of the complaints made to the NJCAA haven't been specified in any public manner, Gronniger said on Wednesday. Reached via phone, the NJCAA said it never discusses the nature, progress or findings of complaints made to it involving a member school.
 It is up to the schools to decide what they wish to say about such matters, a spokesman said. The board voted to adjourn for the night after closed-door discussions ended, more than an hour after Smith left.
 While there as yet remains no reason to believe the NJCAA complaints pertain to Smith's past, in 2014 the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri based in St. Louis, Missouri, sentenced Smith to three years of probation for his involvement in a complex auto theft conspiracy. The court found Smith had been one of 21 people involved in a scheme to steal luxury motor vehicles, and foment other forms of criminal conduct related to the autos, according to Hiawatha World archives. According to CBS 12 KFVS-TV of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the criminal activities affected at least 100 different vehicles across four states.
 Smith had served for four seasons as head coach of the Southeast Missouri Redhawks women's basketball team at that institution in Cape Girardeau, before he resigned for personal reasons in December 2006, according to KFVS-TV. During his tenure, Smith had achieved at that time a better win-loss record than any other women's hoops coach in the NCAA Division I Ohio Valley Conference, according to Southeast Missouri State; the Redhawks achieved their only berth to the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament in 2007.

Not only does she overtly refuse Palpatine's invitation to join him and serve the Dark Side, renouncing her heritage in the process, but she chooses to preserve a different legacy — one of her own making, taking the Skywalker name as her own in order to honor Luke and Leia's memory.

BROCKTON -- Flu season is underway and hospital emergency departments are seeing more patients come in with symptoms than in recent years, doctors say.
 "There has been an uptick in the past few weeks," said Dr. Laura Griffin, associate chief of Signature Healthcare Brockton Hospital's Emergency Department.
 Since the end of December into the new year, hundreds have been tested for the flu at the hospital and Good Samaritan Medical Center. Among those, between 15 and 20 percent of tests have come back positive, according to hospital officials.
 We can deliver news just like this directly to your inbox. You can sign up for This Just In (a daily 7:30 p.m. newsletter with items we've posted that day), News Alerts (so you don't miss anything important) and more. It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.
 Dr. Kenneth Lawson, chief medical officer of Good Samaritan Medical Center, said so far this year 100 people have tested positive for the flu through the hospital's emergency department. Of those, 11 people have been admitted for treatment.
 "The flu is one of those things that cycle through," he said.
 Compared to the past three years, Lawson said the medical center has seen more patients.
 This year, flu season began about three weeks earlier than the previous year, Lawson said. So far this season, there have been 6.4 million flu illnesses nationwide that have resulted in 55,000 hospitalizations and nearly 3,000 flu deaths, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 At both hospitals, staff at the emergency departments have taken precautions to stay safe while working with the flu.
 Griffin said staff members are vaccinated, frequently wash their hands and often wear face masks.
 Lawson said people who come to the hospital showing flu symptoms are given tissues and a face mask. Those who have been admitted are kept away from others to prevent the flu from spreading, he said.
 In any population, people at the extremes -- the young and elderly and those with ongoing medical conditions -- can be affected by the flu and need to be admitted for care, Lawson said.
 Many people are able to recognize flu symptoms and may not need to come to the hospital, Lawson said. If they need help deciding whether to come in, they can talk to their primary care doctor, he said.
 Most who do come to the hospital are discharged and are able to recover at home with rest, fluids and over the counter medicine like Tylenol for a fever, Lawson said.
 "You're giving your body the time to get through it," he said.
 To avoid getting the flu, Griffin said people should get a flu shot if they haven't already and keep their hands washed.
 "It's not too late to get vaccinated," she said.
 Lawson added that people can avoid the flu by limiting time in congested public areas where sick people may be.

A lot of canoe camping equipment from the '60s hasn't stood the test of time, but Calvin Rutstrum's advice on paddling and camping gear remains timeless.  
 In his book "North American Canoe Country" -- published in 1964 -- Rutstrum advises against trying to pack too lightly.  
 "The difficulty will be to arrive at a point of compromise between too much equipment and too little," he writes.  
 When it comes to ultra light gear, Rutstrum cautions, "All too frequently, piddling novelties are passed off for 'go-light' equipment, which seriously impair practical living and create needless physical and mental stress."  
 These days, paddlers have lightened their load with Gore-Tex fabrics, titanium cookware and carbon fiber canoes and paddles. (Carbon fiber boats also will lighten your wallet.) But, as Rutstrum rightly points out, "Going light for mobility's sake is, of course, sound in principle if utility does not suffer."  
 In a previous column, I wrote about Rutstrum's take on solo canoe tripping -- comparing notes from my own experiences. This week, I'll take a look at his approach to outfitting. (My friend and mentor Bill Conrad gave me a copy of "North American Canoe Country" last March and is patiently awaiting a book report.)  
 Rutstrum's advice is spot on. We venture into the wilderness for enjoyment, to be as comfortable as possible in challenging conditions. Why sacrifice that to shed a few pounds of gear? Or select a too small a boat?  
 He advises us to opt for larger, heavier canoes when appropriate, specifically to handle "rougher seas." Case in point: One year, on a mid-October trip on the Muskingum River, I used my 17-foot Grumman -- an aluminum behemoth weighing in at 72 pounds. The following October, on the same stretch of river in Zanesville, I used my 33-pound, Old Town Pack solo canoe. Both years I encountered high winds and waves of two to three feet. There were whitecaps on the river! With the Grumman, I was able to soldier on with confidence. With the solo boat, the waves nearly swamped me four or five times. I had to pull off the river at Kirkbride Marine and wait for the wind to settle down.  
 On the other hand, there are times when a heavier boat would "cause utility to suffer," as Rutstrum puts it. I take my solo boat when bushwhacking in the headwaters -- or on my Algonquin Provincial Park trips with frequent and demanding portages.  
 Rutstrum also advises against opting for too small a tent.  
 "Tents get meager and 'doghousy,' and a week of steady rain makes camp a form of imprisonment," he writes.  
 I have to differ with him on this count. Today's backpacking tents are far superior to the pup tents of Rutstrum's day. The higher-end tents are watertight and surprisingly roomy. Granted, most people wouldn't want to be cooped up in one waiting out torrential rains hour after hour, day after day. That problem is easily solved. A nylon rain tarp suspended from tree trunks with paracord provides roomy shelter, where campers can sit back, relax and stay dry.  
 Then there are those who go to opposite extremes.  
 "The risk of suggesting practical equipment over go-light gear is that the uninitiated are apt to take this as license to being along all manner of cumbersome, heavy equipment -- even worse in its consequences than the piddling variety," Rutstrum writes.  
 This brings to mind the first time I saw my friends Joe Hughes and Curt Redding in their canoes on Lake Fork of the Mohican River. I paddled up behind them and was astonished at how little freeboard they had -- four inches at most. They're hefty guys to begin with and liked to pack heavy.  
 As I got to know Curt and Joe and started canoeing with them, I began to more fully appreciate their approach. Joe's collection of cast iron skillets sure came in handy at mealtime.  
 As Rutstrum would advise, outfit yourself appropriately for the kind of trip you want. To which I would add, let your canoeing buddies do the heavy lifting.

It was during Vajpayee’s tenure that 12 major enterprises were sold to corporates.

The playoffs may be out of the question right now, but if things continue going south and they are unable to recover, the Timberwolves might be feeling pressure to do something with their franchise superstar. Towns has missed 14 consecutive games and the team has been shaky (at best) without him. The good news is he will finally return to the floor tonight.

She called Navarro College head coach Monica Aldama her 'second mom' on Instagram.
 For anyone who's watched even one episode of _Cheer_ , it's obvious how much Monica's support on and off the mat means to every member of the team.

 "If Monica believes in me enough to put me in, then I should be able to trust myself," Morgan says in the series. "I'd do anything for that woman."
