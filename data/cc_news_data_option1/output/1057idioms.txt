One of the classic confusions these days is when you go into a gallery and are confronted by a dizzying smorgasbord of photographs, paintings, sculptures, installation and video.

Hand sanitizer is a hot commodity right now.
 We all know the advice: Wash your hands often with soap and water to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. When you can't, use hand sanitizer.
 But actually finding hand sanitizer anywhere is another story. Bottles of Purell and other sanitizers are few and far between on store shelves, and if you do manage to come across a solution with at least 60% alcohol, chances are it has a hefty price tag.

“I don’t think you can be viable in the car business without a service department,” Rick said.
 “We ride the roller coaster anymore. It’s almost like the stock market.
 “ Some months we are on top of the world and another month we are wondering where everybody went to. The service department adds some stability.”
 The business traces its roots back to 1992 or 1993, depending on who you ask.
 Rick believes it was 1992 based on a memory he has, but says his brother Ray thinks it was 1993.
 “We keep having this disagreement,” Rick joked.
 The business began with Ray, who had worked many years for Outwaters Pontiac and Cadillac, but left to pursue his own venture once it was purchased by local businessman Randy Williams.
 At the time, Rick was the service manager at Fairfield Auto Group, and began working at his brother’s business to build up sales experience so that one day he could move up to a general manager position or similar position in the industry.
 There, he also gained experience with buying cars at auction.
 “I had a little bit of an advantage there being in service all my life and coming up through as a technician,” Rick said.
 Because of this, he was able to spot issues that others might miss.
 Rick moved on to other dealerships in leadership positions.
 When Ray retired, Ray leased to Golden Mile Auto Sales, but continued being a part time dealer in Towanda Township, according to Rick. When Golden Mile Auto Sales went out of business, Ray brought the sales license back to the Wysox Township location.

People can travel freely, but Wolf and Health Secretary Rachel Levine are urging residents to refrain from nonessential travel and any large gatherings. Essential medical services and mass transit remain open, as do supermarkets, pharmacies, and gas stations.
 Philadelphia, unlike its surrounding counties, is not included on Wolf’s shutdown list. And Mayor Jim Kenney has thus far taken a different approach to the crisis.
 Philadelphia law gives the mayor broad powers, allowing the city to “forbid congregation of persons” when facing an epidemic, and ordering isolation or quarantine of people who are infected or exposed to the virus. Kenney used that power Thursday when the city announced a ban on all events with 1,000 or more people.
 And if Kenney determined that the city is in imminent danger of civil disturbance, disorder, or “other occurrence which will seriously and substantially endanger the health, safety, and property of citizens,” he could declare a state of emergency, per the city code. That would give him tremendous power to cut off activity within the city limits, including shutting down traffic in and out of the city and establishing a curfew.
 But Kenney administration officials have bristled at some of Wolf’s decisions in the wake of the virus’ spread. On Friday, they vowed to keep schools open, then changed course an hour later, expressing frustration and anger with Wolf for forcing their hand. And on Saturday, Kenney said Philadelphians should “go out and have dinner and tip your waitstaff.” He later walked back that statement in a tweet, suggesting takeout instead.
 “We have to figure out a way that we can continue moving forward without panicking to the point where everything shuts down,” Kenney told reporters Saturday afternoon. “We may be healthier, but the economy would be in a tank and we can’t have that.”
 Asked about the tension, Wolf on Saturday said “there will be disagreements.”
 “In the case of Philadelphia, I will continue to ... talk with the mayor and his administration to make sure that we are on the same page when it comes to addressing the needs of this crisis," the governor said.
 Left unsaid: that Wolf’s disaster declaration could, effectively, trump Philadelphia’s rules.
 Still, there are limits on the governor’s powers, even in an emergency. There could be lawsuits. And the state legislature could at any time rescind the disaster declaration, which is in effect for 90 days — although longtime political observers could not recall a time that has happened.

After being temporarily managed by Tim Vanbuskirk, Rick came on board on Jan. 1, 2018 and purchased the business from his brother on Jan. 1, 2019.
 Ray remains a 25% owner of the company.
 “The reason I purchased it is that I have a 23-year-old son (Phillip), and Ray Green Jr. I think at some point would like to get back into the car
 business. So, to keep Green’s Auto Mart as Green’s Auto Mart, at 60 years of age, I’ve decided that’s the right and proper way to do it,” Rick explained.
 Upon returning in 2018, Rick said he knew they would one day have to build a garage. There was a shed where some work could be done, “but you couldn’t wash cars in it. If it was a truck, you couldn’t get the truck in and close the doors.” Because of this, Rick ended up subletting a lot of work.
 Rick said he is adamant that not only are the vehicles he sells ready to pass Pennsylvania state inspection, but that he implements a standard to fix anything that could cost the new owner within their first year of ownership.
 Plans for the garage solidified when Rick was able to bring technician Alan Cron – another former Outwaters employee – on board.
 “He is an extremely good technician,” Rick explained. “What makes him so is that he can work on almost anything that comes through the door and has the ability, even if he has not seen it before, to put it together. He will get it done.”
 And Cron brought many of his old customers to Green’s Auto Mart with him.
 MAC Builders of New Albany began construction on the service garage in September 2019.
 “They were hustling. They were really on it,” said Rick.
 The garage opened for business on Feb. 10 with four service bays and a drive- through reconditioning area that starts with washing and ends with detailing. They can also perform state inspections at the site.
 “It gives us the ability to do our own cars, so we aren’t waiting for other folks, that everyone is under the same plane and knows what to expect and what we want vehicles to be, and if there is something that doesn’t pass muster, it goes back out and goes back to the auction,” he said. “No matter what, we just aren’t going to sell that car. Same thing with anything that we would trade.”
 The garage was also designed with the ability to expand easily to accommodate future growth.
 As the temperatures continue to warm, Green’s Auto Mart plans to implement new lighting, repave the lot, and add a stone fascia to their newest addition.
 Green’s Auto Mart is located at 1503 Golden Mile Road.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Twenty-nine Wisconsin residents who were quarantined on a cruise ship in California because of the new coronavirus were escorted to their homes early Monday by members of the Wisconsin National Guard, Gov. Tony Evers said. The Grand Princess cruise ship carrying thousands of passengers docked at the port of Oakland on March 9 after being held out at sea for days. People have been disembarking the ship in waves. Evers said the Wisconsin residents were returned to their homes in the pre-dawn hours. None of the passengers from Wisconsin have tested positive for the coronavirus but they will all self-quarantine for the required 14-day period, Evers' office said. There were more than 3,500 people on the cruise ship and 21 have tested positive for COVID-19. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Two Wisconsin residents remained in quarantine in Texas under the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, citing personal reasons, Evers said in a statement. Seven other passengers on the ship who are Wisconsin residents remain in HHS custody in California, Evers said. “We’re glad to finally have our folks back home in Wisconsin,” Evers said. “These individuals have gone through a harrowing experience full of uncertainty and fear over the past several weeks.\" The Wisconsin residents landed at the National Guard's Volk...

It should also be noted that ford crossing of streams is permitted but skidding across fords is never allowed.
 The Conservation District receives a fair number of logging complaints. Sometimes, the complaint is mud on the roadway. Remember those Chapter 102 regulations?
 Loggers (same as everyone else) are not permitted to drag mud into the public roadways. They would need a BMP in place to control sedimentation (such as a rock construction entrance, to trap sediment as they haul out).
 Sometimes, people complaint about the time of year that loggers are working. While there isn’t a regulation that prohibits logging during certain times of the year, planning the timber harvest to match seasons and soil types IS a Best Management Practice that will save the logger time, money, and potential environmental damages.
 Some complaints are from people who had a logger on their property and aren’t happy with the way their property looks afterwards.
 Often, disturbed areas haven’t had seed and mulch applied, or haven’t been returned to preexisting grade. Sometimes stream banks at crossing areas have not been restored.
 These are things that should be noted in a contract, because oftentimes after a logger leaves the property, E&S violations can fall back on the landowner.
 The best advice is to vet your logging operator and have a solid contract in place before the operation begins. It is advisable to speak with a lawyer about drawing up this contract. A little money up front could save you a lot of money, time, and frustration in the long run!
 One final note: The Conservation District is going to be hosting a logging workshop this spring. Final dates haven’t been set, but we are planning for April.
 The workshop will be comprised of a classroom session followed by a field visit to a logging site. If you are a logger or know someone who is that would benefit from this training, contact the Bradford County Conservation District and we will contact you when the training dates are announced!
  _The Bradford County_ Conservation District _is committed to helping people manage resources wisely.   You can visit the Bradford County Conservation District at 200 Lake Rd in Wysox across from the Wysox Fire Hall. Contact us at (570) 485-3144 or visit our web page at www.bccdpa.com._

Everyone kvetches about how much modern art costs, but this is more to do with our grim fascination with money rather than our specific interest in the works. If an oligarch chooses to spend his millions on a pile of bricks and rubber, at least they are supporting an artist and a gallery, indeed a whole ecosystem in which other, smaller artists can thrive. The general public, meanwhile, isn’t asked to spend millions to enjoy the same stuff, even if it’s true that the cost of a modern exhibition can seem steep.
