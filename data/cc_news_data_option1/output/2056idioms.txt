SWANSEA - Two teachers at Case Junior High were recognized on Saturday as part of a surprise retirement parade, and the event offered a chance for colleagues and even former students to give them a proper sendoff.
 Joe Monteiro, an eighth-grade history teacher, and Jayne Cestodio, the media center secretary, were honored after their last days as educators were cut short to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both teachers had tremendous impact on their students, other faculty members, and the community, as evidenced by the dozens of cars that turned out to say goodbye.
 Cestodio, who ran the media center for 30 years, is a passionate teacher who took pride in developing her students academically, but in turning young boys and girls into young men and women, she said.
 "Seeing them grow from sixth grade to eighth grade always amazed me," she said. "They came to our school nervous, but very excited and then by the time they reached the eighth grade they were much more confident and mature."
 Every year, Cestodio would join her students in going on the Washington, D.C., field trip. She recalls these memories as some of her favorites as a teacher. "You would form a bond with the eight students that you were responsible for," Cestodio said. "For me they were 'my kids' for those couple of days."
 The retirement parade came as a big surprise to Cestodio, as she never would have expected an event honoring her, especially in a time of isolation and social distancing. However, Cestodio said she appreciated the event and its creativity. "Fortunately during this pandemic, people have started to take a step out of the box to try and honor or celebrate a special time in people's lives."
 The retirement parade provided some closure, Cestodio said, in a time where the closing of schools has altered the everyday interactions teachers have with their students. When asked about what made this event special for her, Cestodio commented, "After working with people for so many years it is nice when they reach out to you. It makes you feel special."
 When asked about the impact he's had on his students, Monteiro said, "You sometimes don't realize that at the time."
 Two years ago, Monteiro received the Teacher of the Year award at Case Junior High, an accomplishment that speaks volumes about his impact on students' academic and social lives.
 Monteiro was very grateful and appreciative of his wife, Susan Monteiro, and colleague Julie Silva for organizing the event. "My wife is amazing and how she put this together with Julie Silvia was totally unexpected and completely appreciated!"
 Monteiro had no idea it was being planned. "How she kept it a surprise was amazing and the turnout by my coworkers and past and present student was overwhelming ... stunned," he said.
 Just like Cestodio, Monteiro emphasized the idea of closure and how it was so important, especially because of the sudden end to this school year. "Closure is so important and it wasn't able to happen this year in a traditional setting. What happened today provided Jayne and myself with that experience," he said.
 "I spent my days, my years with these people who became my family," Cestodio added. " I was truly blessed to have made many lifelong friends while loving what I did every day."

PLYMOUTH - Although he didn't get the extended playoff run that he and his teammates were looking for, Jake Fleet's senior season with the Plymouth North boys hockey team was still filled with nothing by great memories.
 "Everything just seemed to come together for us this season," said Fleet, a senior captain who helped lead the Blue Eagles to their first league championship since the 1992. "This team in particular was really close on and off the ice and I think it showed in the way we played together as a team. Everyone was on the same page and we were all pulling for one another to be successful."
 Blue Eagles Head Coach Tim Drew said that sounded very much like something Fleet would say.
 "Jake is a great hockey player and he was just as good of a captain of this program," Drew explained. "Jake was never about getting the individual accolades. He had his eyes set on the overall team goals above everything else.
 "He was all about the team, all the time."
 There were a lot of those individual accolades Drew mentioned coming Fleet's way after his breakout senior season. His 18 goal, 25 assist effort added up to a second Patriot League All-Star selection as well as the Keenan Division MVP award. He was also named to the prestigious Shriners All-Star squad as well as the all-scholastic teams for The Boston Globe, Boston Herald as well as The Patriot Ledger.
 Fleet's success extended to the entire team as the Blue Eagles flew to their first league title in nearly three decades. They finished with a record of 15-4-2 (10-2-1 in league games), taking the title after a close season-long race with Duxbury. Plymouth North grabbed a second seed in the Div. 2 South bracket and were upset in the opening round in overtime by Bishop Feehan.
 "It was really an amazing season," Fleet remembered. "We did some good work together in the off-season and when we beat Plymouth South and Martha's Vineyard in the tournament to open the schedule I thought we had something. When we beat Duxbury in the middle of the season that's when I knew we could do some good things."
 Offensively it was no secret why the Blue Eagles were so successful last season. Fleet teamed with brothers Jason and Kevin Norwood to form one of the more potent top forward lines in the state. Opponents threw everything you could imagine at the trio with little to no success in most cases.
 "I've been coaching for 25 years now and that line had to be one of the top one or two that I have ever coached," Drew said. "The most impressive thing about that line was their anticipation. The three of them knew each other so well that their passes would go to where they were going to be rather than where they were at that moment."
 Fleet grew up playing Plymouth Youth Hockey with the Norwood brothers. He played on a line with Jason as a sophomore and then skated with Kevin as a junior. The trio finally came together this season and made some sweet music together.
 "The three of us just have a connection, on and off the ice," Fleet said. "When we're on the ice together we can always find one another."
 Fleet also played with the Ultimate Frisbee team at Plymouth North and skates the Boston Breakers AAU hockey team. He will play club hockey at Bridgewater State University.

The House's return to Washington for voting Wednesday comes after Senate Republicans — who are on recess after spending the past three weeks in Washington — have been knocking the decision by top Democrats to largely stay out of session during the pandemic.
 House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy’s office announced it was filing a lawsuit Tuesday against the new system of proxy voting. Approved by House Democrats earlier this month, the first-of-its-kind rules change will be in practice this week as dozens of lawmakers sign up to have another vote on their behalf so they can avoid travel to Washington. Republicans call it unconstitutional.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the lawsuit a “sad stunt” as the nation's virus-related death toll approaches 100,000.
 It appears the House could be out of session for much of June as well. The House, which has more than four times as many members as the 100-person Senate, is operating under the Capitol physician’s guidance, as Washington, D.C., remains under stay-home orders.
 Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said there isn't much legislation ready for floor votes, and committees are just beginning to write must-pass legislation like agency budget bills, the annual defense policy measure and a major reauthorization of water projects.
 Hoyer said political messaging bills, usually a feature of election years, are likely to take a back seat for now, as voting in the House has become an arduous and time-consuming process because of social distancing rules.

Okay. I may come back on that one offline. And then just lastly on ABA, you indicated that earnings will be up modestly in fiscal ‘20. And if I look at year-to-date earnings, they were 95 million this year and then last year was 118 million. So it implies the next few quarters you're in the $10 million to $15 million range for ABA. And just curious if I'm in the ballpark? And what would be the big headwind? Is this more of a -- is this a credit issue that you foresee? Is this just loan growth going the other direction, just hoping to get some color because that's been a decent growth driver and has been a stable part of the business. Hoping to just get some color on what you're seeing in the Cambodia business?

Yes. Thanks. I'll start off and maybe Stéphane can add in. But similar to what we described in the retail, we think that early on in the crisis, there was a lot of uncertainty of -- if you remember back very early on of, if and when the government programs would come up to speed. And I think proactively a number of customers really wanted to have some flexibility until they got a sense of what the future would be. And I think that was a wise and proactive thing to do. In terms of the split between the corporate and commercial, there is very little in corporate but -- or smaller amounts in corporate than commercial but Stéphane do you -- give some anecdotes of.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Deadlocked over the next big coronavirus relief bill, Congress is shifting its attention to a more modest overhaul of small-business aid in hopes of helping employers reopen shops and survive the pandemic.
 Bipartisan legislation that would give small employers more time to take advantage of federal subsidies for payroll and other costs is expected to pass the House this week, as lawmakers return to Washington for an abbreviated two- day session.
 Yet absent from the agenda is formal talks between congressional leaders on the next phase of the federal coronavirus response. Democrats have already pushed a $3 trillion-plus measure through the House, but negotiations with the GOP-controlled Senate and White House have yet to begin.
 “We can’t keep propping up the economy forever,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday in Lexington. It was one of his first public appearances in his home state of Kentucky since mid-March because of the pandemic.
 “The ultimate solution is to begin to get back to normal,” he said. “There are three things that are essential to have full normalcy — testing, treatment and vaccine.”
 Senate Republicans are divided on the next steps and wary of another sprawling negotiation where Democrats and the White House call the shots. They are also split on a central element — how much aid to provide state and local governments and other coronavirus response after earlier relief bills totaled almost $3 trillion.

Yes Gabriel, it’s Lucie. So I would say that our assumptions evolve on a weekly basis with the pace of the reopening measures implemented in the different markets. So let's say we monitor and maintain three components of customer behavior. The first one would be loan activity and then the credit behavior and also the customers’ liquidity position. So in the past week, we've seen positive signs of recovery in loan activities, where we see a slowdown, not collapses. So to give you some color, the week of April 6th we faced rock bottom in terms of activity. So mortgage originations were down 50% year-over-year that week, auto lending was down 80% year-over-year, and as well the credit cards purchase volume was down 35% month-over-month compared to February. And we have seen significant improvement since then. And as of last week, for example, mortgage originations are down 5% year-over-year, and auto loans are down 35% and it's also interesting to see that the number of transactions improved quicker than the volumes themselves and do not follow completely the same trend. So that implies to me that growth activity is coming back, but involving lower amounts, showing prudent behaviors from consumers.

Here in the U.S., as Memorial Day Weekend kicks off the country's first post- COVID summer, most Americans are opting for holiday destinations they can drive to. According to a survey by Skift, 66 percent of Americans plan to travel by car for their first post-lockdown vacation. If datapoints such as these should coalesce into a trend, the resultant mobility mix would be a net positive for gasoline demand and could persist until at least an affordable vaccine starts to become available at scale.

Just maybe sticking with regulatory capital. One thing that just caught my eye was the decline in RWA related to market risk, which just surprised me in light of the environment that we're in. I would have expected that to have gone the other way. So I'm just curious as to what happened there? And then on the market risk component of it, the credit, you talked a bit of it, the market risk component of it, how should we think of that evolving over the next few quarters?

Sure. Nigel it's, Bill. I'll take that question. I can understand your question. The shape of the path on some of those variables is very unusual. It is not a normal forecast going forward. And when we -- when our economist team was building this scenario, intra-quarter there is significant changes and shocks that the way that it's sliced and diced and presented in that table, I can understand it's hard to get a feel for the severity of it. I think in the language on the next page, actually it's on the same page, 73. So if you look a little down further, because it's hard to see from those forecasts, there's a little more color given about some of the magnitude of changes of GDP, more than 30% down, unemployment around 12% and things which don't stand out. But that's really because of the unusual nature. That's why as I mentioned earlier, there are different parts of the IFRS 9 ACL or the economic scenario is one of them. You really need to look at what the results are and compare it to the risks. So just in the magnitude as I mentioned earlier in these scenarios, all three scenarios are recession scenarios. And if you look at on the next page, Nigel, the 100% upside scenario, so our most optimistic scenario this quarter generates an ACL that is pretty darn close to a number to what we showed in Q4 as our a 100% pessimistic case scenario. So, the impact on the ACLs is what I think should guide you in assessing the scenarios, just because slicing and dicing next 12 months and future periods just doesn't capture well the significant downturn in the variables. Does that help you answer the question -- help you through the answer Nigel?

I'm so sorry, I guess, that question was answered. So you can look at the transcript, I'm kidding. I think I'll start -- I think, I may have -- I think we answered it earlier, it was just twofold, it was me and Bill. So going back to your point, at the end of the day, never mind stage one and stage two losses. I think the real criteria of outperformance going forward will be phase three losses. And on that, I think as a team, we're still confident that we're going to look pretty good on a relative and absolute basis. The other thing derived from experiences when we identify an issue, we tend to go out at it very proactively. So, historically, that's what we've done with oil and gas. That's what we've done with ABCP. So in this, I think it's more the prudence that you see is more our corporate culture and the way we've been managing the bank for the -- as many last years. And we want to -- we feel that's the right way to manage the business. And that's more a continuation of that way of managing the business than us being wrong in our forecast or positioning in terms of risks. Bill?
