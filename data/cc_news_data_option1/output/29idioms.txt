The cast and crew of _Line of Duty_ have been generous of late, what with creator Jed Mercurio dropping a plot clue for series six and Martin Compston sharing a glimpse of episode one's script.
 So, to follow suit, the BBC has since teased a premiere date for the upcoming season - and it looks like AC-12 will be back before the year is out.
 In a brand new trailer for BBC One's 2020 schedule, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot of _Line of Duty_ is featured, with a concerned DI Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) taking centre stage.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - This holiday break, children at the Cabbage Patch Settlement House in Louisville are learning about the celebration of Kwanzaa.Kwanzaa is the African American holiday celebrated over seven days during the winter, and each day has a different theme.The Cabbage Patch created an activity to represent each day, and Thursday, which was day five, was all about the principle of Nia, which means ‘purpose.’Students learned about helping build up their community by designing a service project.“We have definitely a high African American population, but a lot of our kids had never really heard about Kwanzaa or celebrated themselves, which is a shame because it is a holiday designed for African Americans,” Brandi Giles with the Cabbage Patch Settlement House said.This is the first year the Cabbage Patch has celebrated Kwanzaa.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

A conservative-led attempt to end Wyoming’s death penalty officially kicked off in Cheyenne this week, as a Republican lawmaker there officially announced he would be introducing legislation for a second straight year to bring a stop to the practice.
 Sponsored by Rep. Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, death penalty repeal failed to gain traction in the Wyoming Senate last year after a strong surge of support in the House of Representatives, a significant victory for legislation that has consistently failed to pass muster among Wyoming lawmakers.
 Kylie Taylor, the Wyoming coordinator for Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty (which arrived in the state in June), said this is the year they push death penalty repeal across the finish line.

LAWTON, Okla. (TNN) - A Lawton woman is warning others after she says a stranger tried to kidnap her 2-year-old son.Crystal Phillips says 12-year-old Makayla Phillips was eating lunch with her 4-year-old sister, 2-year-old brother and her grandmother Dec. 23. As they were getting seated, a strange woman approached them."She walked up to them and gave both of them a kiss. My grandma, she thought it was weird and not right, so she decided to move us to a different table,” Makayla Phillips said.The woman walked away but quickly came back to the table."She picked him up and took one step, but I grabbed him back from her and yelled at her and said don’t touch my brother. I thought she was going to towards my sister but my grandma was already on my sister so I said don’t touch my sister, stay away from my siblings and don’t touch my siblings. We were just yelling and she was saying my brother was her baby and I was just yelling back at her saying that’s not her baby, that’s my brother,” Makayla Phillips said.Makayla Phillips said the woman was asked to leave, at which point she began saying disturbing things."She was talking about how she had a baby and she decapitated her baby and how she did all these things to her baby. She was a very disturbed woman. A very disturbed woman,” Makayla Phillips said.Crystal Phillips was at work when this all happened and couldn’t believe the story she was told."Especially in a public place where there are so many eyewitnesses, so many people around, there was no shame, no nothing. It’s terrible,” Crystal Phillips said.Crystal Phillips said it only got worse when she saw the surveillance video."That’s hard to watch. Anyone grabbing my child, even for just a split second, I think the worst. What could have happened, what would have happened if she wasn’t there,” Crystal Phillips said.Lawton Police were called and are investigating. Sergeant Timothy Jenkins said situations like this show how important it is to always know your surroundings and to teach your kids to not talk to strangers."It’s more applicable and easier to talk to a stranger because you have social media, you have gaming systems, stuff like that. So, people don’t think about it in that regard. But even in the real-life aspect, when you’re out and about somewhere, people don’t think about it because it’s common. Your kid may know somebody before you know somebody. They may know them from a sporting event or something. So, we still try to encourage make sure you know everybody your kid is talking to. If you’re out and about and you have no idea who this person is, ask questions,” Jenkins said.Crystal Phillips said she hopes this can serve as a warning to others out there that this could happen to anyone. She said she’s thankful her daughter quickly jumped into action to prevent the situation from being much worse.Copyright 2019 Texoma News Network. All rights reserved.

The ambiguity of Tippit’s stenciled drawings expands and intensifies in her canvases. In “Follow,” “Mine,” “Sheer” and “Loose,” background and foreground flip-flop. In “Peer,” “Cinch” and “Toll,” the picture-plane seems to wrap around the figurative element, snuggling up yet leaving it free to slip away.
 “Enter,” “Sold” and “Skirt” are abstract compositions intruded upon by figurative elements. The seemingly flat expanses of “Bell,” “Dress” and “Lune” turn into infinitely deep spaces only to snap back. The ensuing tug of war — between what you think you see and what’s really there — invites double takes, second thoughts, second looks.
 Throughout the exhibition, confusion breeds pleasure. Kitty Brophy’s electrifying images of women come to mind, as do John Wesley’s deliciously painted pictures of cartoon-inspired mischief. But Dickinson is the guiding light behind “Still Life With Volcano,” illuminating the silent poetry of Tippit’s slippery imagery.

PERRY COUNTY, Miss. (WDAM) - Perry County Sheriff Mitch Nobles is sending out a warning to gangs responsible for recent shootings in the area. Within the span of a week, multiple shootings have left at least four people injured and others fearing for their safety and peace of mind.The first shooting happened at a McLain gas station in Greene County on Christmas Eve. Another happened a couple of days later at Oakwood Apartments in Beaumont, while a third happened Sunday night in the Little Creek community of Perry County.Nobles said all of those shootings involved a rivalry between the Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples street gangs.Six men have been arrested in connection to those shootings, charged with gang-related crimes. Four of those men are already out of jail.The other two, Jordan Martin and Joshua Griffin, went before a judge Thursday morning and had their bonds set at $100,000 each.The sheriff said gangs have no place in Perry County and his department is working to put a stop to them.“When it comes to senseless shooting in my county and my job is to protect the people of this county, and I’m not going to tolerate it," Nobles said. "I’m not going to put up with it. I’m going to do whatever it takes. If I have to sit here, day in, day out, work my guys and we lock up every gang member that’s in this county, you know, to put them in jail for something, I’m going to put a stop to this senseless shooting.”All of those injured in the shootings are expected to recover.Copyright 2020 WDAM.

 Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes fell from record highs on Friday after a U.S. air strike in Iraq killed a top Iranian commander, sharply escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and sending investors scurrying to safe-haven assets.
 Iran vowed revenge after Qassem Soleimani, head of its elite Quds Force, was killed in the air strike that was authorized by President Donald Trump.
 Benchmark bond yields fell to their lowest level since Dec. 12, dragging down bank shares, including those of Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc. Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were in the red.
 "The market is just on edge and giving up a large portion of yesterday's gains," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
 "There is a question of what this (air strike) is going to turn into and if it's going to be something long lasting."
 The CBOE Volatility index, an options-based gauge of investor anxiety, hit its highest level since Dec. 10.
 At 10:22 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 243.50 points, or 0.84%, at 28,625.30, the S&amp;P 500 was down 24.97 points, or 0.77%, at 3,232.88. The Nasdaq Composite was down 72.91 points, or 0.80%, at 9,019.28.
 The three main indexes had closed at record highs on Thursday as fresh steps by China's central bank to boost its economy added to investor optimism over trade and the global outlook.
 But denting sentiment further on Friday, data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade.
 Benefiting from higher gold prices, miners Newmont Goldcorp , Kirkland Lake and Barrick Gold gained between 0.7% and 1.2%.
 Weapons makers Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman added more than 3% each.
 Meanwhile, American Airlines Group Inc and Southwest Airlines Co fell 4.9% and 2.4%, respectively, as oil prices jumped about 4%.
 In a bright spot, Tesla Inc's shares hit a fresh record after beating Wall Street estimates for vehicle deliveries in its fourth quarter and meeting the low-end of its full-year delivery goal.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.65-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
 The S&amp;P index recorded nine new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and eight new lows. (Reporting by Manas Mishra and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)

Iran’s supreme leader warned that a “harsh retaliation is waiting” for the U.S. after the airstrike, calling Soleimani the “international face of resistance.”How Iran will respond remains in question as well. It could include anything from challenging U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf, firing ballistic missiles or deploying the asymmetrical proxy forces Iran has long cultivated.Soleimani’s death is the latest in a series of escalating incidents tracing back to Trump’s decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers.The killing, and any forceful retaliation by Iran, could ignite a conflict that engulfs the whole region, endangering U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and beyond.Oil prices surged, reflecting investors’ jitters about Mideast stability. Iran vowed revenge against Americans.Twitter users turned “WWIII” into a top trending term. But there was praise from Israel and a right-wing opposition leader in Italy.Pompeo worked the phones, calling world capitals to defend the killing.Over the last two decades Soleimani had assembled a network of powerful and heavily armed allies stretching all the way to Lebanon and Israel’s doorstep.He enjoyed the fierce loyalty of tens of thousands of fighters in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Gaza Strip who received aid, arms and training from Tehran. Many of them are within easy striking distance of U.S. forces and American allies, including Israel.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says Trump has “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox" with the targeted killing.The former vice president is joining other Democratic White House hopefuls in criticizing Trump’s order, saying it could leave the U.S. “on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East."Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling the attack “dangerous," while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says it was “reckless."Israel’s prime minister has welcomed the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s top general, saying Trump “deserves all the credit for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”Benjamin Netanyahu said the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force was “responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people.

Israel has long viewed Iran as its greatest threat and has carried out airstrikes in recent years against Iran-backed forces in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.Global powers are also warning that the world has just become a more dangerous place.The United Nations secretary-general is urging leaders to “exercise maximum restraint." The U.N. chief stressed in a statement from his deputy spokesman that “the world cannot afford another war in the Gulf.” The spokesman said Friday the U.N. chief “is deeply concerned with the recent escalation" in the region. China, Russia and France, all permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, took a dim view of the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani.A French deputy minister says “We are waking up in a more dangerous world.”Russia’s Foreign Ministry condemned the U.S. airstrike as “an adventurist step” that will inflame that Mideast. China said it was “highly concerned.”But Britain and Germany also suggested that Iran shared blame for provoking the targeted killing that dramatically ratcheted up tensions in the Mideast.A German government spokeswoman says the U.S. strike is “a reaction to a whole series of military provocations for which Iran bears responsibility."Urgent reconciliation efforts are being launched behind the scenes, and calls for restraint are growing.A European Union top official urges all parties involved to avoid further escalation “at all cost."The minister of state for foreign affairs in the United Arab Emirates, which sits across the Persian Gulf from Iran, calls for rational engagement and a “calm approach, free of emotion.”And Iraq’s president urges Iraqis to remain united to spare the country more violence after decades of bloodshed.Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton is congratulating all involved for “eliminating" Iran’s top military commander.Bolton said in a Twitter post on Friday, that “long in the making, this was a decisive blow against Iran’s malign Quds Force activities worldwide. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran."Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved. ",

Oil prices surged as much as 3 a barrel as gold, the yen and safe-haven bonds all rallied on Friday after the U.S. killing of Irans top military commander in an air strike in Iraq ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Tehran.Traders were spooked after the death of Major General Qassem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force who was also one of Irans most influential figures, and by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneis vow of revenge. Mideast-focused oil markets saw the most dramatic moves, with Brent oil futures leaping as much 4.5 to 69.20 a barrel. That was the highest since the attacks on Saudi crude facilities in September, though the impact hit almost every asset class.Europes broad STOXX 600 index fell as much as 1 and shares on Wall Street almost the same as New Year optimism, which had pushed equity markets to new records, evaporated. The yen rose half a percent against the dollar to a two-month high, the Swiss franc hit its highest against the euro since September and gold prices climbed to a four-month peak, racing past the key 1,550 an ounce level.Geopolitics has come back to the table, and this is something that could have major cross-asset implications, said Salman Ahmed, Lombard Odiers chief investment strategist. What is critical is how it pans out in the next few days, Ahmed said. Whether it turns into a theme depends on Irans reaction and then the U.S. response.Iran promised harsh revenge. Soleimanis Quds Force and its paramilitary proxies, ranging from Lebanons Hizbollah to the PMF in Iraq, have ample means to mount a response. In September, U.S. officials blamed Iran for attacking the oil installations of Saudi Aramco, the state energy giant and the worlds largest oil exporter. Iran has denied responsibility for the strikes and accused Washington of war-mongering.The Trump administration then did not respond, beyond heated rhetoric and threats, and markets settled down within a week after Brent surged 14.6, its biggest one-day percentage gain since at least 1988. The U.S. government and others on Friday urged their citizens in the region either to return home or to stay away from potential targets and public gatherings.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a round of TV interviews that the United States remained committed to de-escalation with Iran but that it had needed to defend itself. He Soleimani was actively plotting in the region to take actions - a big action as he described it - that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. We know it was imminent, Pompeo told CNN.MSCIs gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.43, while its emerging markets index lost 0.32. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 210.81 points, or 0.73, to 28,657.99. The SP 500 lost 18.86 points, or 0.58, to 3,238.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 58.26 points, or 0.64, to 9,033.93.The global gauge and Wall Street indices set record closing highs on Thursday, extending the year-end rally in equities. Brent hit a peak of 69.50 a barrel, its highest since mid-September, though it later traded up 2.40 to 68.65.West Texas Intermediate WTI crude rose 2.20 to 63.38 a barrel, after earlier spiking to 64.09 a barrel, its highest since April 2019. SCRAMBLE TO SAFETYYields on German Bunds and U.S. Treasuries - the worlds benchmark government bonds that are typically seen as the safest assets - fell sharply. The 10-year Bund yield fell 7 basis points to a two-week low of -0.299, while Bund futures were up 0.51 percent, at 172.13 euros.Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 2332 in price to yield 1.802, from 1.882 late on Monday. The dollar index fell 0.08, with the euro up 0.06 to 1.1177. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.59 versus the greenback at 107.94 per dollar.The focus on geopolitics meant markets paid little attention to stronger-than- expected data from France, where inflation rose 1.6 year-on-year in December, beating analysts expectations for a 1.4 rise. German inflation figures were also higher, although unemployment in Europes largest economy rose more than expected.The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade, with order volumes crashing to near an 11-year low and factory employment falling for a fifth straight month, the Institute for Supply Management said. Investors also were looking forward to the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserves Dec. 10-11 meeting due at 2 p.m. 1900 GMT.

Lawyer Digby Johnson, representing Fretwell, said police were contacted because staff were unhappy about the presence of the co-accused at his flat.
 "He was a malevolent influence and cuckooed himself into the address," he said.
 This offence was Fretwell's first offence of dishonesty in 53 years, and he had made his admission at the earliest opportunity at the lower court.
 Fretwell was on a three-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, when this offence was committed.
 "It is a dissimilar matter," added Mr Johnson. "He is obviously someone who has mental health and physical health problems. He has badly ulcerated legs.
 "He had travelled the world, and worked for some time in Australia back in the early 1990s."
 Recorder Kelly said when Fretwell came into court for him to deal with the matter, it had been in his mind he was going to go to prison to serve the three months of the suspended sentence.
 But he said he had been persuaded by what was said by Mr Johnson.

Mississippi State fired head coach Joe Moorhead after two seasons on the job, according to multiple reports Friday.
 Formerly the offensive coordinator at Penn State, Moorhead was 14-12 with the Bulldogs -- 6-7 this season.
 His final game on the sideline was the Music City Bowl on Monday, in which Mississippi State squandered a 14-0 lead to Louisville and lost 38-28.
 After a 3-1 start to the season, the Bulldogs lost four straight and were 3-5 in Southeastern Conference play. Mississippi State posted just its second losing season in the decade.
 The end of his tenure was marred by an incident on Dec. 20 when starting quarterback Garrett Shrader and a teammate reportedly engaged in a post- practice scuffle and suffered a broken orbital bone. He was unable to play in the bowl game.
 Mississippi State was the first FBS head coaching job for the 46-year-old Moorhead. He has the head coach at his alma mater, FCS program Fordham, from 2012-15 before moving on to Penn State. He previously worked as an assistant at UConn (2009-11), Akron (2004-08) and Georgetown (2000-03).

Wall Streets major indexes fell from record highs on Friday after a U.S. air strike in Iraq killed a top Iranian commander, sharply escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and sending investors scurrying to safe-haven assets. Iran vowed revenge after Qassem Soleimani, head of its elite Quds Force, was killed in the air strike that was authorized by President Donald Trump.Benchmark bond yields fell to their lowest level since Dec. 12, dragging down bank shares, including those of Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc. Nine of the 11 major SP 500 sectors were in the red. The market is just on edge and giving up a large portion of yesterdays gains, said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.There is a question of what this air strike is going to turn into and if its going to be something long lasting. The CBOE Volatility index, an options-based gauge of investor anxiety, hit its highest level since Dec. 10.At 1022 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 243.50 points, or 0.84, at 28,625.30, the SP 500 was down 24.97 points, or 0.77, at 3,232.88. The Nasdaq Composite was down 72.91 points, or 0.80, at 9,019.28. The three main indexes had closed at record highs on Thursday as fresh steps by Chinas central bank to boost its economy added to investor optimism over trade and the global outlook.But denting sentiment further on Friday, data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade. Benefiting from higher gold prices, miners Newmont Goldcorp , Kirkland Lake and Barrick Gold gained between 0.7 and 1.2.Weapons makers Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman added more than 3 each. Meanwhile, American Airlines Group Inc and Southwest Airlines Co fell 4.9 and 2.4, respectively, as oil prices jumped about 4.In a bright spot, Tesla Incs shares hit a fresh record after beating Wall Street estimates for vehicle deliveries in its fourth quarter and meeting the low-end of its full-year delivery goal. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.65-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The SP index recorded nine new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and eight new lows.

NORFOLK, Va. (NNS) -- Winter weather is here, and there will be a significant increase in traffic as people travel to various destinations to spend the holidays with family and friends. During this time of the year, the Naval Safety Center (NAVSAFECEN) reminds travelers to practice deliberate consideration of safety in winter conditions and practice overall risk management when operating a motor vehicle.
 Drivers should plan to get plenty of sleep, ideally between 6-8 hours before a road trip. If you become drowsy or start to fall asleep while driving, take a break. Pullover in a safe location where you can get some rest. Drowsy driving can be as dangerous as driving under the influence.
 It is also important to share the details of road trips with family members or friends. This information sharing includes when you are leaving for a trip, your intended route, and the approximate length of time to destination.

Investors rushed into safe-haven assets on Friday after U.S. air strikes in Iraq killed a senior Iranian military official, sending the Japanese yen to a two-month high, while the weakest U.S. factory activity in a decade sent the dollar reeling. In addition to the yen, U.S. Treasuries, German bunds and gold rallied after the overnight air strike in Baghdad killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of Irans elite Quds Force and architect of its growing military influence in the Middle East.Overall, geopolitical risk premia have risen substantially overnight. Youre looking at inflows into the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen - investors really looking for safe havens and a port in the storm, said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments. The U.S. dollar index initially benefited from the move into safe-havens, but those gains were erased after the report of a contraction in the manufacturing sector in December. It was last unchanged on the day at 96.846.The Japanese yen had risen as high as 107.91 per dollar and was last up 0.54 on the day at 108. The yen is often seen as a haven from risk, given Japans status as the worlds largest creditor nation. A holiday in Tokyo also made for thin conditions, exaggerating the move. The attack sparked concerns about crude supply disruptions, lifting oil prices more than 3. Petrocurrencies gained slightly on the higher crude prices, but those were then largely offset by the overall move away from risk, said Schamotta.The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade, with order volumes crashing to a near 11-year low and factory employment falling for a fifth straight month, according to a report from the Institute for Supply Management released on Friday. That is a depressing number, said Schamotta.It suggests trade war-related uncertainty has actually damaged the manufacturing sector on a sustained basis and that points to weakness in GDP, particularly in the coming quarter because what youre likely to see is an inventory drawdown as opposed to continued build. The longer-term effects on the dollar are unclear. Though down on Friday, the greenback may ultimately benefit if weak U.S. manufacturing dents hopes for global growth in 2020.The idea that other countries that are large exporters to the U.S. might see a large rebound in the near term - that idea is losing traction here, said Schamotta.

If the Series 5 is still too pricey for your budget, Best Buy is taking $15 off multiple Apple Watch Series 4 models. After discount, pricing starts at $384.View Deal
 The Editor's Choice Apple Watch Series 5 has all the bells and whistles you could ever want in a smartwatch. It features an always-on display, built-in GPS/LTE, and it's also swim proof. That's in addition to its heart health diagnostic tools.
 By comparison, the Series 4 -- which is only available through third-party retailers -- doesn't have an always-on display and it uses the previous-gen Apple Watch CPU. That's not a bad thing, but the Series 5 is the model to get if you want the latest and greatest.
 That said, if the Series 5 is still too pricey for your budget, Best Buy is also taking $15 off all Apple Watch Series 4 models with prices starting at just $384.

Yakoub clearly communicates to brands that the sponsored content must align with her other posts. "For example, when I've partnered with airlines in the past, I've kept the content destination focused on the feed while tying in the brand messaging in the caption rather than posting a photo of an airplane on the feed, which is hard to make interesting," she said.
 Yakoub said she no longer actively seeks work. Instead, brands reach out to her if they see her as a good fit for their campaign, and she believes her move to New York from Chicago in 2016 is part of the reason why. "Networking has played a huge role in the campaigns I'm offered," Yakoub said. "When I moved to New York, I started to get invited to all of these PR events, and I would go to all of them so I could meet all of the PR companies and go out to lunch with them."
 "Once you're on the PR lists, you receive regular sponsorship and campaign offers from brands," Yakoub explained.
 # Looking to the future
 Yakoub says her goal for 2020 is to expand the brand further beyond Instagram. "I recently hired an editor for the blog, and I'm looking to scale the blog and make it bigger than it is right now," she said.
 Outside of the blog, Yakoub is releasing a book titled "Live The Spirit of Adventure" in March of 2020 with Ten Speed Press, a Penguin Random House imprint. After Yakoub was featured in the Washington Post in 2017, a publishing company reached out to her and referred her to a literary agent. After putting together a proposal and sending it to 40 publishers, Ten Speed Press picked it up. The book is set to include photos and travel stories from approximately 100 women who have been featured on the Dame Traveler Instagram account.
 She's also considering selling Dame Traveler merchandise or even creating a Dame Traveler wine brand. "Right now, I need to figure out what will be best and focus my energy there," she concluded.

There are very few objective truths out there that everyone can seem to agree on. But one of them is most certainly the fact that playing guitar through headphones sucks. Whether you're using a dedicated headphone amp (which often look like relics from the 1980s) or just plugging your trusty over-ears into a tube amp that would wake the neighbors even at the lowest settings, the experience is underwhelming at best. A number of companies have tried different things to try to improve the situation, but Boss' Waza Air are probably the most novel I've seen. For one, this is the first time I know of that a company built a guitar amp directly into a set of headphones. And secondly, the Waza Air includes some pretty unique features that make it feel more like you're listening to an actual amp in a room, rather than just blasting a raw guitar signal into your ears.

Your vehicle gets “plastered” with the stuff in every nook and cranny underneath by direct “upswish” from your tires and general updraft. The rest of the vehicle gets that whitish salt look all over it from the splashing of other vehicles around you, most notably trucks and buses. It is quite easy to write “Wash Me” into such coatings !
 The parts of the vehicle most affected are the exhaust pipes, mufflers, clamps and hangers; the hydraulic brake lines, wheel components, coil springs, axles, transfer cases, frame, shields, fasteners and, well, just about anything that is made of a metal that can corrode. Most notably, the braking and steering systems are primary concerns for safety.

 In addition to maintenance and winterization, there are additional precautions before hitting the roads in frigid weather, such as warming up the car before driving. While it is warming up, take this opportunity to clean the external windows, cameras and side-view mirrors to provide for better visibility around the vehicle. Remove dirt, ice and snow from sensors to allow assistive driving features like automatic emergency braking to work effectively.
 “Create an emergency kit for your car. Include a blanket, first aid kit, water, granola bars, a flashlight, reflective triangle or flares and a small bag of sand in case you get stuck on ice,” said Wilson. “If driving into colder weather, be aware that shaded areas and bridges may have ice on them even though the roads are clear.”
 Fleet readiness begins with following these tips and practicing good risk mitigation both on and off-duty.

By Shreyashi Sanyal Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Chilean and Mexican pesos slid to two-week lows against the dollar as investors turned risk averse after a U.S. air strike in Iraq killed a top Iranian commander, causing tensions to flare in the Middle East. Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, died in a strike on Baghdad airport, prompting Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to vow harsh revenge. "It (Iran) would certainly have to weigh the risk of a significant military conflict with the U.S., a possibility that market participants may now have to take into account," Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank wrote in a note. MSCI's index for Latin American stocks fell 0.6%, while currencies in the region dropped 0.4%. A cooling of trade tensions between the United States and China had helped raise demand for riskier Latin American assets, with the equity index poised to register its fifth straight week in the black. The Latin American currencies index, on the other hand, is set to snap a four-week winning streak as it eyed a flat end to the week. Chile's peso was 1.1% weaker at 761.65 to the dollar, its softest level since Dec. 16. Mexico's peso weakened to 19.036 to the dollar. Mexico's creditworthiness came under increasing scrutiny in 2019, with two rating agencies flipping their sovereign outlook for the country to negative and one downgrading its rating. Investors are now worried that Mexico and state-run oil company Pemex could risk downgrades in 2020. The Brazilian real slipped on Friday. Data showed on Thursday, Brazil's trade surplus shrank 20% to $46.67 billion last year, as upwardly revised exports in recent months failed to mask a widespread slump in overseas demand for Brazilian goods over the course of 2019.

One area that is less significant than in the past is the possible loss of Iranian production. Due to the reimposition of U.S. economic sanctions that have greatly hindered the sale of Iranian oil in the U.S. market, Iranian production has dropped from 3.8 million b/d in the middle of 2019 to 2.15 million b/d at present, according to S&P Global Platts. Exports are now measured in a few hundred thousand barrels per day. If the Iran-U.S. conflict escalates and drone or other military attacks are launched at Iranian oil facilities, the reality is that sanctions have taken many barrels of Iranian supply off the market already.
