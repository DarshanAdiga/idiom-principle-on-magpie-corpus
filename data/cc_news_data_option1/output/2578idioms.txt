Color is another easy, subtle way to call to mind a vacation destination, Wood says.
 “Think about the bold pops of color you might see on an island getaway. Or opt for layers of serene blues and seafoam greens paired with neutral hues to evoke the sea and sand and create a calming backdrop,” she says.
 If a sophisticated hotel is more what you long for, Wood has suggestions.
 “Chic hotels have a few key components: luxurious materials, sleek furniture and restrained styling. If you’re feeling bold, start with a saturated wall color. Choose case pieces that have an interesting material burl or metallic textured finish. Add glam accents such as velvet and gold, and finalize the look with abstract or geometric art, sculptural vases and art books,” she says.

Faced with the prospect of playing 60 games in 66 days, time-consuming safety protocols, the responsibility to remain diligent health-wise off the field and the general anxiety of working amid a pandemic, Boone believes focus and toughness can be as important to a team this season as baserunning or bullpen management.

There were no scheduled workouts Wednesday or Thursday, but the team planned to allow players to work out on their own or with a position coach if needed.
 Almost every team, including the Mariners, scheduled the first official workouts for Friday.  With the spacial limits of T-Mobile Park, the plan is to have two workouts – a morning and afternoon – featuring pitchers and position players in each, spread out across the facility to take advantage of the field, the bullpen mounds, both the home and visiting weight rooms and batting cages and the concourses.
 A limited group of media will be allowed to cover the workouts from the press box starting Friday, with player and coach availability via Zoom.
 The Mariners’ 60-man summer camp roster is a mix of players expected to use the 60 regular-season games to generate MLB experience and top prospects who will remain on the “taxi squad” for the entire season, but will benefit from the daily workotus and expected intrasquad or simulated games to be played at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma.

The Yankees won't hold their first full-team workout until Saturday, even though manager Aaron Boone said players began intake testing Wednesday. That's when he plans to address the team for the first time — also in waves.
 “We’ll have to get creative with how we communicate,” said Boone, who plans to make the same speech three or four times.
 Faced with the prospect of playing 60 games in 66 days, time-consuming safety protocols, the responsibility to remain diligent health-wise off the field and the general anxiety of working amid a pandemic, Boone believes focus and toughness can be as important to a team this season as baserunning or bullpen management.
 “How do you deal with that mentally and emotionally?” Boone asked. “How you’re able to separate that out when you take the field each and every night? There’s an advantage to be had there."
 After gauging workloads for pitchers during the shutdown, Boone expects his starters will be ready to face live hitters on the first day of summer camp. He plans to stay flexible on usage and may consider using a six-man rotation or openers, but nothing has been determined yet as all teams adjust to a new norm.
 “An injury can wipe out a season in a hurry,” Boone said, adding that he’s likely to be cautious with players early after New York placed a major league record 30 players on the injured list a total of 39 times last season.

He got depressed, wondering if he could have done more even though he wore masks and gloves outside the house prior to becoming ill.
 Hottovy spent eight hours at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago on the 12th day and was prepared to stay overnight. Instead, he got sent home with a breathing apparatus.
 “If my story, if my journey through this, helps one person realize how severe this can get — and if that saves one life — then I want my story to be heard," he said. "Again, I’m sorry I’m emotional. It’s still fresh.”
 Hottovy coughed so much during one Zoom meeting with pitchers that manager David Ross took over for him.
 Hottovy kept a cooler filled with drinks in the spare room because he didn't want to risk exposing his family by going to the kitchen.

The IMO Guidelines provide further detail about the requirements for developing the IHM. The preparation of the IHM for new ships seems, on the face of it, more straightforward as it simply requires declarations from suppliers at an early design and construction stage (in relation to Part I) as to the hazardous material content of products used. However, experience of compliance with similar requirements in other established EU waste law, particularly ROHS (Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electronic and Electrical Equipment), suggests that establishing materials used in the production of many thousands of components is likely to be a significant endeavour.

NEW YORK (AP) — The St. Louis Cardinals have replaced the New York Yankees as the opponent for the Chicago White Sox in the Field of Dreams game on Aug. 13 at Dyersville, Iowa.
 The schedule change caused by the new coronavirus pandemic meant the White Sox no longer play the Yankees this season. The new opponent, first reported by The Des Moines Register, was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the arrangements who spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the matchup has not been announced.
 Major League Baseball hopes to announce its new schedule next week. Each team will play 60 games, 40 against division rivals and 20 against teams in the corresponding regional division in the other league.
 “We hope to have the option to play,” MLB said in a statement. “Construction is continuing and we are following all CDC and state protocols regarding recommended safety practices, including social distancing, washing hands, and temperature checks before arriving to the site."
 It remains unclear whether fans would be allowed at the game, which is to be televised nationally by Fox.
 "We are monitoring ongoing events and plan to remain as flexible as these circumstances demand,” MLB said.
