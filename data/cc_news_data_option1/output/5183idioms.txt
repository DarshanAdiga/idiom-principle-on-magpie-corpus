"Un augurio sincero a tutti voi, un traguardo che ci eravamo posti lo scorso anno e che adesso abbiamo raggiunto - ha aggiunto la prof.ssa Vania Patane -. Siete tutti componenti di una grande squadra che condivide sforzi necessari per raggiungere i traguardi e superare momenti difficili". "Mi piacerebbe che il personale che stabilizziamo in questi giorni considerasse il contratto a tempo indeterminato come un momento di partenza e non come la fine di un percorso - ha aggiunto il direttore generale dell'ateneo, prof. Giovanni La Via -. Non posso e non voglio trascurare il valore della garanzia occupazionale, comprendo a pieno che la stabilizzazione e il raggiungimento di un obiettivo. Ma sono sicuro che ognuna di queste unita di personale avra voglia di continuare a scommettersi e di proporre soluzioni innovative per la nostra amministrazione anche dopo il raggiungimento di questo traguardo, proprio perche ha la possibilita di farlo in totale serenita".

Stanionis pressed forward behind the jab in the eighth. A thunderous uppercut sent Gonzalez down for the second time close to round's end. Once again - the rugged Gonzalez got back to his feet and survived the round. Although he looked like he didn't want to come out for the ninth, Gonzalez went straight to swinging on his man. An overhead right, however, put Gonzalez down and out - the referee wisely waving off the bout without bothering to count.

The council voted unanimously to approve the decriminalization of marijuana ordinance. The ordinance makes the possession of less than an ounce of marijuana a civil offense punishable by a progressive fine as opposed to a criminal offense that will show up on an individual’s criminal record. The civil penalty would be a progressive scale based on the number of infractions. For the first offense, the fine will not exceed $100, on the second offense the fine should not exceed $200 and for the third and any subsequent offense, the fine should not exceed $350.

But not everyone was on board with the City Council’s proposal.
 The California Grocers Assn., which counts large chains such as Kroger and Albertsons among its members, said it was concerned by the council’s decision and called it “limited in scope.”
 “By singling out the grocery community, and by the same turn, failing to consult with store operators, we are concerned the city will make policy decisions based on flawed information and reasoning,” the group said in a statement.
 Cases of the coronavirus have been skyrocketing throughout the region. On Tuesday, Long Beach reported _4,702 cases_ per 100,000 people, up from 3,592 cases just two weeks before. Fewer than 1% of all ICU beds in Southern California are available, according to state data.

It was also a significant victory because Boonen was far from guaranteed another success. His last victory dated back to 2009 and the two previous years were rather lackluster by Boonen standards. Some even started saying that he was over the hill. But I remember talking to him at the team’s pre- season presentation in Brussels, and if memory serves me, he even referred to Muddy Waters, saying that he was ready to get his "Mojo Working" again. And he very much did, not only winning Roubaix, but doing it in dramatic fashion with a long solo breakaway. It was a magnificent victory with Boonen clearly at his best.

So Norfolk looks likely to remain in Tier 2, which is probably sensible, and does at least mean that our hard-pressed restaurants can stay open and try to rescue what should be the busiest time of the year. The days leading up to Christmas seem to be when everybody wants to eat out.   Although dining in a restaurant is for me one of life’s most wonderful pleasures, this is a time of year when I normally avoid them. It’s a month when what I regard as one of the single biggest annoyances in life is commonplace. It is something which in an instant can ruin an expensive night out, make even the most lovingly-cooked food taste sour, and is certainly one of the most selfish things known to man.   I refer to the braying, shouty, self-centred noisy table, which always seem to be seated right next to the couple trying to have an atmospheric and romantic night out.   I don’t mean those tables where everyone is having a genuinely good time, laughing and chatting in the way that restaurants are made for. No, I’m on about the restaurant show-offs, whose noise is deliberately aimed at showing everybody else what a great time they are having, or how wealthy and successful they are, when really all they are doing is demonstrating to everybody else that they are selfish oafs.   Often this is exacerbated by the restaurant itself pumping out music so loud you could be in a nightclub Perhaps this is an attempt to cover up the unpleasant braying from table five, but in reality it just encourages the shouters to up their own volume, in an unnecessary and wearing aural arms race.   It is too common for both restaurateurs and selfish customers to forget that as well as coming for the food, most people who eat out are mainly there to talk to each other. Which is practically impossible against a deafening cacophony of piped music and shouty customers.   Up until now the only recourse has been to vote with our feet, which is deeply unfair on the restaurant, but an inevitable consequence of most establishments’ reluctance to ask noisy tables to tone it down a bit for the benefit of everybody else. I say ‘up until now’, because it looks like the tide might be turning, and for this we have to thank coronavirus. The pandemic has mainly brought much misery and suffering, but every cloud has a silver lining, and banishing restaurant loud-mouths might just be the shiny halo around the Covid cloud.   Because it turns out that not only do such people spread noisy misery, but they are in danger of spreading the dreaded disease as well. A scientific paper recently published in Asia has suggested a close link between ‘loud talking or shouting’ in restaurants and an increased rate of Covid infections.   It would appear that the most annoying boors can spread infection over a 6.5-metre radius – far more than the two metres which we have all learned to respect. It’s the reason that hospitality venues have been instructed to turn down the music (hooray, let’s hope that lasts beyond the pandemic), so that people don’t have to shout at each other.   To protect us all, restaurants need to do more If serving staff are nervous that their entreaties to quieten down for good manners’ sake will fall on deaf ears, maybe the threat of being thrown out for being super spreaders might have the desired effect. All but the terminally thick or incredibly selfish have by now accepted we have to modify our behaviour for the sake of others’ health.   Like most people, I can’t wait for the day when we all feel safe going out to crowded places, without the need for constant hand sanitising, wearing a mask, and keeping our distance from strangers and friends alike. But if we can keep just one thing from the pandemic, could it please be quieter restaurants, with no or minimal music, and above all with the noisy brigade being told to shut up for good.

"Hoy hemos recibido la confirmación del laboratorio Pfizer-BioNtech, que durante este mes de diciembre aterrizará en Chile el avión con las primeras 20 mil dosis de vacunas, lo que nos permitirá empezar a vacunar de inmediato a todas las personas que trabajan en las Unidades de Cuidados Intensivos de nuestro Sistema de Salud en las regiones con mayor incidencia de coronavirus, como la Región del Bío Bío, Araucanía y Magallanes, y a parte del personal de la Región Metropolitana", declaró Piñera.      Sobre el plan de vacunación, este contempla 3 grupos prioritarios, quienes deberían recibir el fármaco entre este mes y el primer semestre del 2021: Primero, personas desplegadas en la emergencia Covid, segundo, adultos mayores y enfermos crónicos, priorizando a los de Centros de Larga Estadía, y tercero, los otros grupos de la población objetiva, según su grado de riesgo.      Las siguientes dosis de la vacuna llegarán en enero, las que estarán enfocadas en inocular a la población crítica y de mayor riesgo durante los primeros seis meses del próximo año.

Looking at reporting and discussion of the 2020 presidential campaign, has any word been misused as often as “misinformation”? In much political debate, it was used to mean “information I don’t like,” rather than something that was provably false. That confusion extends to a new survey of American attitudes done by Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The survey questioned 2,752 respondents and was conducted in mid-November.
 Gallup found that 64% of Americans believe they were subjected to more “misinformation” in the 2020 campaign than in earlier campaigns. That number included 52% of Democrats, 66% of independents and 79% of Republicans. “Majorities of those who say they were exposed to misinformation this election year believe they were exposed to it on social media and cable TV news,” the study says. “This finding is in light of the fact that major internet companies handled misinformation differently in the run-up to the election and afterward by enacting measures to label false information — something they largely did not do before this year.”
 The surveyors found some common ground between the political parties but also major differences. Start with where people believe “misinformation” is coming from. Gallup asked, “Where do you think you were exposed to misinformation about the election this year?” Everyone — Democrats, independents, Republicans — pointed to Facebook. But Facebook was mostly an aggregator of other media reports. And there were big differences between the parties about the original sources of “misinformation.”

When the World Health Organization declared 2020 the Year of the Nurse, no one could have imagined just how fitting that title would be. I have always believed nursing is a noble vocation. However, as I reach the culmination of 50 years as a nurse, at the height of a pandemic, I couldn’t be prouder to be among some of the most incredible health care professionals in the world.
 At Parkview Health, our nurses’ careers and lives were forever changed on March 8, when we had our first confirmed case of COVID-19 in one of our hospitals. Teams in every facility quickly learned to adapt to changing protocols, new information, new treatments and the responsibility of caring for some of the sickest patients they’d ever seen.
 Through it all, they’ve displayed incredible bravery and relentless determination. Whether they work at the bedside in a hospital, in a Parkview Physicians Group office, or in the Parkview Access Center answering calls from patients around the clock, our nurses have been an integral part of our response to the pandemic.

C'e chi ha brindato a casa, in smart working, chi in ufficio. Tra lacrime e applausi, rigorosamente "a distanza", ieri mattina 44 lavoratori precari dell'Universita di Catania hanno "festeggiato" insieme con il rettore Francesco Priolo l'agognato traguardo: il contratto di assunzione a tempo indeterminato. "È bello vedervi qui, anche se a distanza - ha detto il prof. Francesco Priolo alla presenza del prorettore, la prof.ssa Vania Patane, e del direttore generale, prof. Giovanni La Via -. Ci tenevamo ad essere in aula magna, nonostante la pandemia, per una cerimonia degna dell'importanza di questo momento cosi come lo scorso anno quando in 140 firmarono il contratto a tempo indeterminato. Abbiamo proseguito questo percorso insieme con i sindacati, in modo congiunto, e ringrazio il direttore generale per il lavoro svolto. Ricordo che fino a qualche anno vi erano 249 unita di personale da stabilizzare". "Oggi e un giorno di festa per l'Universita di Catania - ha sottolineato il rettore Francesco Priolo -. Dopo tanti anni di precariato e di attese abbiamo dato piena dignita a numerosi lavoratori e lavoratrici, e alle loro famiglie, che con dedizione e senso di responsabilita hanno dato tanto a questa istituzione perche la nostra e una comunita universitaria, un posto di lavoro speciale dove studenti, docenti e personale si confrontano di continuo. Un traguardo importante in un momento difficile a causa della pandemia e un plauso va a tutti i colleghi impegnati in campo sanitario e a coloro che garantiscono la nostra sicurezza negli uffici". "Purtroppo non possiamo brindare di presenza, lo facciamo solo virtualmente con voi per festeggiare questo momento importante. Adesso ci attende un 2021 di grandi sfide per tutti noi come la valutazione della ricerca e l'accreditamento fondamentali per il piazzamento del nostro ateneo" ha aggiunto il rettore a conclusione del messaggio ai 44 firmatari del contratto a tempo indeterminato che da diversi anni svolgono il proprio servizio negli uffici dell'amministrazione centrale, dei dipartimenti, dei centri di servizio e, adesso, non saranno piu precari inseriti grazie alla stabilizzazione avviata con la procedura della Legge Madia, ma entreranno a pieno titolo nei ruoli dell'Ateneo.
