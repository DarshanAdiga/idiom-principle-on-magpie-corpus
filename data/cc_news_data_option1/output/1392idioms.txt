First with social distancing guidelines and later because of Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order, municipal governments have been tasked with finding creative solutions to continue functioning while being as transparent as they can be about decisions.
 While Cumberland County has the capability of livestreaming its commissioners’ meetings on YouTube, few municipalities have dabbled with alternative methods to meeting in-person. Many in March had to move ahead with boards voting on issues that required attention, even if the public was not allowed to physically attend the meetings.
 With most of the emergency votes completed for the next two months, municipalities now must figure out how they can get the public back in the loop.

Demand for electricity has plunged with the onset of South Africa’s Covid-19 lockdown, removing the threat of load shedding for its three-week duration. It could be several months before the economy is up and running normally again, but it would be a big mistake to forget the power constraints which plagued South Africa in the weeks before the pandemic struck.

It’s just the logistical availability of it is what’s forcing the prices up,” Hamilton said. “Say Walmart stocks their shelves in the morning and say the first 10 people wipe it out, well the next 100 people that come by, they don’t see any out there, so they panic and then they go to the next store and wipe it out, and it puts stress on the store and on the market in general because people can’t get what they need.”
 Hamilton said the business has tripled since the outbreak and more people have been hired to keep up with the workload.
 “We seem to be working harder in the same amount of time,” Hamilton said.
 Two factors led to this busy period for butchers: canceled livestock shows led to a surplus beef and pigs, and grocery stores started running out of meat, Key said. Buying, selling and processing of livestock normally goes on during stock show season, but now scheduling is happening all at once.
 “I’m hoping that people realize that going to a local producer is maybe a little bit smarter way to go and have beef in their freezer and not have to worry about if there is a shortage, they know they have meat in their freezer,” Key said. “Right now, generally people go week to week to the grocery store, and they rely on the grocery store to have what they need, but in a situation like this, if the grocery store is out then they’re in trouble.”
