OCEAN CITY -- About six months removed from a particularly violent stretch in Ocean City in June and about six months away from a potential recurrence next summer, the issue boiled to the surface again this week.
 In the span of about two weeks in mid-June, there were at least two stabbings and several major altercations on the Boardwalk including a major fight that resulted in the severe beating of a young man. Fifteen guns were confiscated in nine days. The pattern continued throughout the rest of June as the incidents intensified with more significant altercations and packs of young people running wild on the Boardwalk. The incidents reached a crescendo on one particularly violent Friday night when law enforcement was forced to utilize a tear gas-like substance to break up unruly crowds.
 The reasons for the outbreak are likely many. For example, the unruliness seen in Ocean City was likely a symptom of the unrest and riots that were unfolding around the nation. The COVID pandemic was in full swing, diminishing the typical June crowds somewhat and making hotel rooms and rental units readily available and less expensive for the unruly crowds.
 The J-1 foreign seasonal workers were not in Ocean City because of COVID, making those lower-priced accommodations more readily available. On top of that, most major June events were cancelled or postponed, including the Firemen's Convention and the OC Air Show, which attract a different clientele to the resort during the month.

 The police and revenue officials rushed to the spot and pacified the agitators following which they dispersed.
 Meanwhile, following the Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s visit to the district and assurance to take stock of damage to the crops, Horticulture Additional Director Tamivendan inspected the locations in Tirupuvanam, Illayankudi and Kalayarkoil. He told reporters that the survey indicated that at least 10,000 acres of chilly and another 125 acres of onion in these pockets were damaged in the rain. He said the district administration would take stock of the damage independently.
 ## Novel stir
 Tesidents of Devakottai resorted to a novel demonstration of transplanting seedlings on the roads. Though the government had promised to complete the underground drainage work in the Karaikudi Municipality covering all the 36 wards by March, not even 50 % of the work had so far been completed. The TWAD Board had taken up the work at a cost of ₹ 112.50 crore in 2017 to lay pipes for 155 km and create 5,559 manholes, among others. With the roads being dug up for the work, buses to Devakottai too have been suspended.
 The farmers submitted a memorandum to the Agriculture and PWD officials to immediately drain the rainwater stagnating in at least 400 acres as the standing crops may totally be destroyed. They said that the Nadamangalam big tank near Sivaganga had surplussed in the recent rainfall and the water could not be drained from the lands. There has not been any action despite repeated pleas, they said.

But, this overreach regarding KHG and its reform-minded position paper is consistent with Woelki's more reactionary turn of late.

 Murray went onto expand on the topic of having a 'super sub' in the team and whether a manager would refrain from placing a player in the starting XI if they continue to make an impact on the substitutes bench.
 "Have you ever been in incidents where, and you've probably heard it in dressing rooms, the manager feels he makes a fantastic impact so why would you start him?" asked Murray.
 "We really like him (Riis), he gets in behind but he makes a good impact."
 Begovic responded, saying: "That can be a role that you play in a team. If the manager feel comfortable using him like that, then that's the way it stays.
 "I think overall most players would want to start the games and play as many minutes as they can."
 With North End facing a much kinder sequence of fixtures on paper, there's no doubting Riis' quality lies with a spot in Neil's starting eleven.

"Everything's a blur," said Katie Hobbs, Arizona's Secretary of State. "I don't even know what day it is."


  Since Election Day, every single avenue of communication to her office -- every phone line, every social media account -- has been inundated with attempts at contact from angry supporters of President Trump who believe the 2020 election was somehow rigged or stolen, Hobbs said in a recent interview with _Phoenix New Times_.


  The top election official in the state, Hobbs said she couldn't even classify the deluge as political pressure, given that her office has already done everything demanded of it to ensure the election was conducted fairly; there's nothing to pressure her into. Rather, the Secretary of State says, the flood of fervor, vitriol, and threats of violence from these irate disbelievers amounts to pure harassment. She described Trump's moves to delegitimize the election, and the vitriol and threats of violence that's rising out of his loyal base, as being tantamount to an attempted coup.


  "I think that the ultimate end goal for the President and his supporters -- who are continuing to cry foul, and screaming for all of these things -- they want to overturn the results of a free and fair election that was conducted according to the laws of the state of Arizona, and the other states of this country," Hobbs said.

The European Central Bank on Thursday kept its key interest rates at historic lows and expanded its stimulus program.
 The 25-member governing council left its benchmark refinancing rate at 0% and its deposit rate at negative 0.5% — meant to encourage banks to lend money rather than to hold onto it.
 It also expanded its emergency bond-buying program by €500 billion ($604 billion), bringing it to a total of €1.85 trillion.
 This will be achieved with newly-printed money; it aims to drive down longer- term borrowing costs and help keep credit affordable and plentiful for consumers, businesses and governments.
 The program has been extended to the end of March 2022, from its original expiration date of June 2021.
 ## Uncertainty remains high
 "The monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favorable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability," the ECB said."At the same time, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs."
 The decisions were largely in line with market expectations.
 The move was made as the bloc battles a second wave of coronavirus over the winter, seeking to help businesses survive until the pandemic eases, and help support governments that are borrowing heavily to pay for aid to businesses and workers.
 Many national governments have already instituted heavy lockdown measures, and more lockdowns are being considered which will affect economic output.
 With the pandemic worsening, the eurozone economy is expected to shrink again in the last quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the eurozone rebounded in Q3 after a Q2 period blighted by initial lockdowns in a string of countries. Year-on-year growth rates are down across the board since the pandemic reached the continent.
 Mass vaccinations should begin early next year, but it could take many months for enough people to be vaccinated that it properly limits the spread and helps the economy open up fully.
 Separately, EU leaders will meet on Thursday to try and push through a €750 billion recovery fund that is currently being held up be Poland and Hungary, who object to provisions tying the assistance to upholding standards on the rule of law.

 # US stocks wobble as pandemic damage to economy piles up
 Stan Choe
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _New York_ – U.S. stocks are wobbling on Thursday, following more evidence that the pandemic is tightening its grip on the economy and as investors wait to see if Congress will do anything about it.
 The S&P; 500 was virtually unchanged in morning trading after erasing an early loss of 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9 points, or less than 0.1%, at 30,062, as of 9:58 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.
 Treasury yields swayed up and down but were holding relatively steady after a report showed 853,000 U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That was more than economists expected and an acceleration from the prior week. It’s also the latest reminder that the pandemic is doing more damage to the economy in the near term, even if prospects are rising that a COVID-19 vaccine will get the economy healthy in the longer term.
 Economists and investors have been imploring Congress to deliver more financial support in the meantime, to help carry the economy until it can stand on its own. After months of partisan bickering and no progress on Capitol Hill, momentum seemed to swing higher recently for a deal. But talks are still mired in deep uncertainty. A bipartisan group of senators has made one proposal, while the White House has made another.
 Through this pandemic, when investors have been worried about the health of the overall economy, they’ve often piled into Big Tech stocks for safety. Profits for these companies have proven more resilient to stay-at-home orders, and they’re benefiting from an acceleration of work-from-home and other trends.
 But some big internet stocks were nevertheless weaker on Thursday. A day earlier, the U.S. government and 48 states and districts sued Facebook, accusing it of abusing its market power. Its shares dipped 0.5% in morning trading.
 Google’s parent company fell 1.2%.
 In Europe, stock markets were subdued even though the European Central Bank delivered another half-trillion of euros ($600 billion) in stimulus for the economy. Coronavirus counts are also spiraling higher on the continent, and its central bank is promising to buy more bonds to push the economy along. Germany’s DAX lost 0.8%, and France’s CAC 40 fell 0.3%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up by 0.2%.
 In Asia, markets made modest moves. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2%, South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.3% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.3%. Stocks in Shanghai were virtually unchanged.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 0.92% from 0.93% late Wednesday .A government report released Thursday morning showed that inflation was slightly stronger last month than economists expected, though it still remains modest.

 # Airbnb, resilient in pandemic, goes forward with IPO
 Dee-Ann Durbin
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 Airbnb proved its resilience in a year that has upended global travel. Now it needs to prove to investors that it sees more growth ahead.
 The San Francisco-based home sharing company makes its long-awaited debut on the public market Thursday. The company priced its shares at $68 apiece late Wednesday, giving it an overall value of $47 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who was not authorized to speak because the amount had not yet been made public. The shares will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “ABNB.”
 Airbnb raised $3.7 billion in its offering, making it the biggest U.S. IPO this year, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks IPOs. The company had initially set a price range of $44 to $50 for it shares, but raised that to a range of $56 to $60 earlier this week indicating rising investor demand.
 Airbnb’s listing comes a day after another San Francisco-based company, DoorDash, soared through it initial public offering, the second largest after Airbnb’s. DoorDash’s stock jumped 85.8% to close at $189.51. The meal delivery app raised $3.4 billion with its offering.
 Airbnb wants to add more hosts and properties, expand in markets like India, China and Latin America and attract new guests.
 First, it will need to recover. Airbnb – which has never posted an annual profit – said its revenue fell 32% to $2.5 billion in the first nine months of this year as the coronavirus forced travelers to cancel their plans. The company delayed its IPO – initially planned for the spring – and funded operations with $2 billion in loans. In May, Airbnb cut 1,900 employees – or 25% of its workforce – and halted programs not related to its core business, like movie production.
 But in the months since, Airbnb’s business rebounded faster than hotels as travelers felt safer booking private homes away from crowded downtowns during the pandemic. In Miami, for example, short-term rental occupancy reached 83% in October, while average occupancy for hotels was 42%, according to STR, an accommodations data firm.
 Airbnb said the number of nights and experiences booked, which plummeted 72% in April compared to year-ago levels, were down 20% in September. Airbnb debuted experiences – from cooking classes to surfing lessons – in 2016.
 Airbnb now has 7.4 million listings, from castles to treehouses, in 220 countries. They are operated by 4 million hosts. The company controls around 39% of the global short-term rental market, according to Euromonitor. It’s the market leader in Europe but trails VRBO, a vacation rental company owned by Expedia, in North America.
 Looking ahead, Airbnb thinks it could see a surge in business from people who are able to work remotely.
 “We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere,” Airbnb said in a recent financial filing.
 It could also expand its offerings further into boutique hotels, as it signaled with its 2019 purchase of last-minute hotel room supplier Hotel Tonight.
 Still, Airbnb acknowledges it will be difficult and expensive to attract new hosts and guests. Its revenue growth rate was already slowing in the years leading up to the pandemic.
 “I do think the company will benefit from the pent-up travel demand once the vaccine is widely distributed, but why would someone want to buy into a travel-related, unprofitable business with slowing growth?” said Scott Rostan, the CEO of Training the Street, which advises Wall Street analysts.
 Airbnb was born 13 years ago in the San Francisco apartment shared by Brian Chesky – now the company’s CEO – and Joe Gebbia, who leads its design studio and Airbnb.org, its charitable arm.
 Chesky and Gebbia were looking for a way to subsidize their apartment. When they learned a design conference was coming to town and hotels were full, they set up a website – AirBedandBreakfast.com – and rented out air mattresses. They got three takers. In 2008, they formed a company with Nate Blecharczyk, a software engineer.
 Home sharing wasn’t new. VRBO was launched in 1995. Booking.com, another older rival based in Amsterdam, mainly offers hotel rooms but has also branched into vacation rentals.
 What Airbnb did differently was focus on affordability, letting hosts rent out spare rooms and sofa beds, said Tarik Dogru, an assistant professor in the Dedman College of Hospitality at Florida State University who studies Airbnb. Guests strayed further into neighborhoods than they would if they stayed at a hotel.
 “Airbnb offered that feel of authenticity for those who are looking for it,” Dogru said.
 That has sometimes been a problem. The company has angered some cities, which accuse it of promoting overtourism and making neighborhoods less affordable by taking housing off the market. Los Angeles, Paris and even Airbnb’s home city of San Francisco have passed laws restricting its rentals.
 Airbnb’s rapid growth – the number of hosts and active listings grew more than 20% in both 2018 and 2019 – has also made it difficult for the company to ensure quality. Last November, Airbnb promised to verify all its listings to make sure they match the photos on its site. It also spent the last year removing party houses and tightening rules for guests after a deadly 2019 shooting at an illegal Airbnb house party in California.
 Relationships with hosts and guests have been rocky at times. After multiple reports of racist behavior targeting guests, Airbnb instituted a nondiscrimination statement that all guests and hosts must sign. It won’t display a guest’s profile photo until a property is booked, so a host can’t deny a room based on a guest’s race.
 And earlier this year, hosts revolted after the company let guests cancel bookings and get full refunds due to the pandemic. Airbnb responded by promising $250 million to hosts to help make up the shortfall.
 Cary Gillenwater, a university professor and Airbnb host in Duivendrecht, The Netherlands, said the company didn’t provide much financial assistance to him, even though he let many guests cancel without penalties.
 Gillenwater usually makes more than $21,000 each year renting out a room on his property with its own entrance. This year, he’ll be lucky to make $2,500. He’s looking into renting the room to office workers to use during the day.
 Despite his experience, he’s considering investing in Airbnb and thinks it will continue to grow. Home sharing is invaluable for his family of five, he said, because it’s difficult to find hotel rooms that are large enough.
 “I feel like there is a future for them, but we have to get through all this first,” he said.

Phyllis Coleman Mouton learned from her mother at a young age how to play poker. By the time she was 13, she formed a neighborhood poker club where players bet with sticks of gum.
 It was her mother, she recalled, who went lengths that were uncommon in the segregated era of the early 1960s to expose her to new things. Like attending academic events at Southern University at age 15. Or helping integrate Mount Carmel Academy in Lafayete at age 16.
 Coleman Mouton, who was honored with the Trailblazer Award during Wednesday’s Women Who Mean Business awards, credited her mother and others during her formative years for her success as a professional.
 “My mother was a person who taught me great values,” Coleman Mouton said. “She taught me that I had an obligation to help others, our families, our neighborhood friends and our community. She encouraged me to use my voice, my abilities and my will to create positive change.
 “She taught me to open those doors and emphasize the need to help others come through. She said, ‘Pull somebody up, Phyllis.’”
 Coleman Mouton was one of 10 honored during Wednesday’s virtual event presented by Home Bank and the United Way of Acadiana.
 Others honored included Tina Begnaud with the City of Breaux Bridge Tourism, Kalli Christ, executive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Acadiana; orthodontist Dr. Melanie Fowler; Holly Howat, director of Beacon Community Connections; Anita Levy with The Levy Cancer Foundation; Dr. Amanda Case Logue, chief medical officer with Oschner Lafayette General Health; Linda Peters with LA Cardiovascular and Limb Salvage Center; Leigh Rachal, executive director for Acadiana Regional Coalition on Homelessness and Housing executive director and Lafayette Parish Schools Superintendent.
 Mouton, who was born and raised in Lafayette, was vice president of workforce and economic development at Baton Rouge Community College from 1997 until her retirement in 2017 when she was named Distinguished Retiree.
 She was also the first African-American women to be named president of the Rotary Club of Baton Rouge, the fourth-largest club in the world with over 500 members. She was also the first African-American to be named interim CEO of the Capital Area United Way.
 Women should work together to increase female representation on public and private boards and leadership positions, she said.
 “I have always looked for ways to use my voice to open doors to positive change and success, especially success for Black girls and Black women,” Coleman Mouton said. “We should be committed to impactful change. We should help each other as women to ensure that our voices are heard.”

In a heart-rending incident, three members of an impoverished family — a middle-aged woman and her two daughters, both in their late 20s — allegedly committed suicide by consuming a toxic chemical used for polishing gold ornaments at their rented house in Gandhi Chowk here late on Wednesday night.
 The tragic incident shook the neighbours and relatives of the deceased, leaving the head of the poor family G Prakash, 58, a worker of a gilt polishing shop, in untold misery. The deceased were identified as Govindamma, 48, and her daughters Radhika, 29, and Ramya, 27.
 The trio allegedly entered into a suicide pact unable to come to terms with the acute financial problems and ended their lives by consuming the highly toxic chemical substance late on Wednesday night. Prakash, who returned home from work late in the night, knocked on the door several times but did not get any response. He grew suspicious and alerted the police, who in turn broke open the main door and found the trio lying dead on the floor in the second room.
 Sources said that the COVID-19 pandemic-induced crisis exacerbated the financial problems of the poor goldsmith’s family leaving them in penury. Radhika, a graduate, and Ramya, who discontinued her studies after SSC, had taken up tailoring to surmount the financial difficulties but in vain, sources added.
 Radhika’s marriage was fixed with a youth from the erstwhile undivided Warangal district in January next year. However, Govindamma was terribly upset over the hand-to-mouth existence of her family and her inability to afford the minimum expenses for her elder daughter’s wedding slated to be held in less than a month.
 The town-based social worker Annam Srinivas Rao shifted the bodies of the trio to the mortuary at the District Headquarters Hospital in the Annam Seva Foundation’s ambulance and counselled a devastated Prakash. Some relatives of the deceased on Thursday came forward to perform the last rites of the trio as per the customs even as the grief-stricken Prakash remained penniless, sources said.

"We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere," Airbnb said in a recent financial filing.


  ## Could expand offerings


  It could also expand its offerings further into boutique hotels, as it signaled with its 2019 purchase of last-minute hotel room supplier Hotel Tonight.


  Still, Airbnb acknowledges it will be difficult and expensive to attract new hosts and guests. Its revenue growth rate was already slowing in the years leading up to the pandemic.


  "I do think the company will benefit from the pent-up travel demand once the vaccine is widely distributed, but why would someone want to buy into a travel-related, unprofitable business with slowing growth?" said Scott Rostan, the CEO of Training the Street, which advises Wall Street analysts.


  Airbnb was born 13 years ago in the San Francisco apartment shared by Brian Chesky -- now the company's CEO -- and Joe Gebbia, who leads its design studio and Airbnb.org, its charitable arm.


  Chesky and Gebbia were looking for a way to subsidize their apartment. When they learned a design conference was coming to town and hotels were full, they set up a website -- AirBedandBreakfast.com -- and rented out air mattresses. They got three takers. In 2008, they formed a company with Nate Blecharczyk, a software engineer.


  Home sharing wasn't new. VRBO was launched in 1995. Booking.com, another older rival based in Amsterdam, mainly offers hotel rooms but has also branched into vacation rentals.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghan government negotiators and the Taliban have agreed to have Islamic law and teachings guide them in peace talks underway in Qatar. That's according to a document obtained on Thursday by The Associated Press. It details a 21-point list of rules and procedures for the negotiations and sheds light on what the talks, which are taking place behind closed doors, actually look like. The warring sides signed the document last week in Qatar, where the U.S.-brokered talks began in September. It warns warring sides against leaking documents or speaking to the media. It also calls for the negotiations to be conducted with “honesty, sincerity and in good atmosphere.”

Research from around the world supports the idea that transmission of the virus can be feast or famine.
 In one notable case from Washington state in March, one sick member of a choir sang in a room with 60 other people for two and a half hours. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report found that 87 percent of the people there got sick; three were hospitalized and two died.
 On the other hand, stories abound about people living in close contact with an infected person for weeks without getting sick.
 With COVID-19, it appears that a small number of infected people often are responsible for widespread transmission.
 Efrem Lim is a virologist with Arizona State University who leads his institution’s collaboration with the Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union, an alliance of researchers from across the state that collects viral samples, sequences their genomes and shares the findings.
 What they’ve found is the virus is constantly mutating, albeit usually in a way that doesn’t make it more or less dangerous to humans, Lim said.
 These tiny changes, however, do cause it to leave a paper trail in its genetic code as it spreads from person to person. If someone has an identical version of the virus as another, they likely contracted it from that person, or at least the chain of transmission between the two is short.
 The researchers have examined more than 3,000 positive samples and recently published an analysis of their data in the American Society for Microbiology journal mBio.
 They found that the virus started circulating in Arizona in February and these first instances of community spread were imported from the outbreak in Washington state.
 Lim’s group determined that the state’s first COVID-19 case – a member of the ASU community who had recently returned from China – resulted in no additional cases.
 “So that was the opposite of a superspreader, someone who was very compliant, followed the rules, isolated, and there you go,” Lim said. “You see evidence of it completely shutting down the chain of transmission.”
 Their data also showed where one infection resulted in many others, whether through a single superspreader event or through a chain of transmission.
 This quality of the virus – that some can give it to no one and others to many – does not have to do with its genetics, Lim said.
 For various reasons, he added, it is possible that some people may shed more virus than others, but an undoubtedly important factor is the choices an infected person makes.
 “A lot of it is actually driven by human behavior, which is why it’s important that people should still keep wearing a mask,” Lim said.

Reports that vaccines produced by drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna appear to be safe and effective, along with the deliberate emphasis on science-based guidance from the incoming Biden administration, are likely to reverse uncertainty in a big way, said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University School of Medicine.
 "I think that's going to flip the trust issue," he said.
 The shift is already apparent. A new poll by the Pew Research Center found that by the end of November 60% of Americans said they would get a vaccine for the coronavirus. This month, even as a federal advisory group met to hash out guidelines for vaccine distribution, a long list of advocacy groups — from those representing home-based health workers and community health centers to patients with kidney disease — were lobbying state and federal officials in hopes their constituents would be prioritized for the first scarce doses.
 "As we get closer to the vaccine being a reality, there's a lot of jockeying, to be sure," said Katie Smith Sloan, chief executive of LeadingAge, a nonprofit organization pushing for staff and patients at long-term care centers to be included in the highest-priority category.
 Certainly, some consumers remain wary, said Rupali Limaye, a social and behavioral health scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Fears that drugmakers and regulators might cut corners to speed a vaccine linger, even as details of the trials become public and the review process is made more transparent. Some health care workers, who are at the front of the line for the shots, are not eager to go first.
 "There will be people who will say, 'I will wait a little bit more for safety data," Limaye said.
 But those doubts likely will recede once the vaccines are approved for use and begin to circulate broadly, said Offit, who sits on the FDA advisory panel set to review the requests for emergency authorization Pfizer and Moderna have submitted.
 He predicted demand for the COVID vaccines could rival the clamor that occurred in 2004, when production problems caused a severe shortage of flu shots just as influenza season began. That led to long lines, rationed doses and ethical debates over distribution.
 "That was a highly desired vaccine," Offit said. "I think in many ways that might happen here."

The treated varieties will be used for crisp and French fry manufactures, and a limited tonnage can only be used from long-term storage to supply the nominating companies.
 DMN will be applied to stored crops by contractors who are members of the National Association of Agricultural Contractors’ (NAAC) Post-Harvest Treatment Group.
 To qualify for treatment, under the EA, other sprout control products must be known not to have worked or be able to work, AHDB explains.
 Crops will also be tested to ensure they meet eligibility criteria agreed with CRD as a condition of the approval.
 Potatoes may only be supplied to factories where the waste will be segregated as part of a stewardship process.
 This is because it is also a condition of the EA that treated potatoes cannot be used to feed livestock.
 Adrian Cunnington, Head of Crop Storage Research at AHDB said that without access to DMN for the final three months of storage, the crisping sector would’ve had to resort to bringing crops in from overseas to fulfil the storage-gap.
 "We estimate this would have cost £20 million and left British growers without a market for their crops," he added.
 “Gaining this EA has been a long and complex process, especially when you include our original application made in the summer that would have covered over 500,000 tonnes of potatoes – but we are glad to have got it over the line in the nick of time.
 “AHDB applies for 70% of the emergency approvals in the potato and horticulture sectors, and has robust research programmes to show that other products do not work in certain situations.”
 An application for full UK approval of Sightä, the product containing DMN, has been submitted to CRD by manufacturer DormFresh and is currently under consideration.
 It is hoped that this product will become more widely available for the whole industry to use once fully approved, and also that waste segregation will not be necessary.
 It is currently authorised for use in eight European countries.

A new adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front is set to be one of the biggest budget movies to ever come out of Germany – and Netflix has scooped the release rights. Daniel Brühl is set to lead the war drama, his previous work including roles in _Inglourious Basterds_, _Rush_, and _Captain America: Civil War_. He’s also due to star in the upcoming MCU series _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_ with Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan.
 Based on the 1929 classic novel about World War I by former German infantryman Erich Maria Remarque, the script has been penned by former Washington Post journalist Ian Stokell and producer and actor Lesley Paterson. The novel follows teenagers Paul Baumer and his friends Albert and Muller, who voluntarily enlist in the German army. Initially passionately patriotic, their preconceptions about what’s right and wrong quickly crumble away as they witness the horrors of life on the front.
 Edward Berger is on board to direct, who’s previously helmed projects like the Showtime series Patrick Melrose starring Benedict Cumberbatch and AMC’s The Terror featuring Tobias Menzies and George Takei. _Earlier this year_, Berger called the project a “physical, visceral and very modern film that has never been told from my country’s perspective. We now have the chance to make an anti-war film that will truly touch our audience.”
 This isn’t the first time the novel has been adapted – a version made for the screen soon after its publication went on to win Best Picture at the 1930 Oscars and a Golden Globe-winning TV movie followed in 1979. However, this is the first time it’s been adapted by a German filmmaker.
 There’s no release date for All Quiet on the Western Front yet, but in the meantime, you can check out our list of the _best Netflix movies_ you can stream right now.

 The judge agreed with Mr. Stalin’s counsel P. Kumaresan that people holding high office and those in public life must show some tolerance and should not waste the time of the courts by filing criminal defamation cases at the drop of a hat.
 He also concurred with State Public Prosecutor (SPP) A. Natarajan that politicians must show restraint and should avoid making scurrilous remarks. The judge said there must be a bonhomie among political leaders, and they must set an example to others.
 Though as many as 12 quash petitions filed by the DMK president had been listed before the judge on Thursday, he quashed four of them since it was reported that the co-accused in those cases had already obtained favourable orders from the High Court.

 When it was brought to the notice of the judge that the defamation case in 2012 was filed because Mr. Stalin had accused Jayalalithaa of vacationing in Kodanad when there was an outbreak of cholera in Chennai, he wondered how the State would prove the charge.
 “It is an admitted fact that the then Chief Minister was residing in Kodanad and discharging her official functions from there. What is the defamation in this? How are you going to prove it? In what way has this statement affected her official functions?” he asked.
 In reply, the SPP stated that it was not right on the part of the petitioner to have accused the then Chief Minister of having gone on vacation to Kodanad. He also said that the State was ready to prove its case during trial by producing witnesses.
 Further, during the hearing of the petition to quash the prosecution launched for reprehending the opening of Chembarambakkam lake in 2015, the judge appreciated the State government for the precautionary measures taken during the recent monsoon.

Rebounding faster than hotels


  But in the months since, Airbnb's business rebounded faster than hotels as travelers felt safer booking private homes away from crowded downtowns during the pandemic. In Miami, for example, short-term rental occupancy reached 83% in October, while average occupancy for hotels was 42%, according to STR, an accommodations data firm.


  Airbnb said the number of nights and experiences booked, which plummeted 72% in April compared to year-ago levels, were down 20% in September. Airbnb debuted experiences -- from cooking classes to surfing lessons -- in 2016.


  Airbnb now has 7.4 million listings, from castles to treehouses, in 220 countries. They are operated by 4 million hosts. The company controls around 39% of the global short-term rental market, according to Euromonitor. It's the market leader in Europe but trails VRBO, a vacation rental company owned by Expedia, in North America.


  Looking ahead, Airbnb thinks it could see a surge in business from people who are able to work remotely.

 The tragic incident shook the neighbours and relatives of the deceased, leaving the head of the poor family G Prakash, 58, a worker of a gilt polishing shop, in untold misery. The deceased were identified as Govindamma, 48, and her daughters Radhika, 29, and Ramya, 27.
 The trio allegedly entered into a suicide pact unable to come to terms with the acute financial problems and ended their lives by consuming the highly toxic chemical substance late on Wednesday night. Prakash, who returned home from work late in the night, knocked on the door several times but did not get any response. He grew suspicious and alerted the police, who in turn broke open the main door and found the trio lying dead on the floor in the second room.

 # Biden taps Susan Rice as domestic policy adviser, Denis McDonough for VA
 Julie Pace and Zeke Miller
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ — President-elect Joe Biden is naming Susan Rice as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, giving her broad sway over his administration’s approach to immigration, health care and racial inequality and elevating the prominence of the position in the West Wing.
 The move marks a surprising shift for Rice, a longtime Democratic foreign policy expert who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser and U.N. ambassador. She worked closely with then-Vice President Biden in those roles and was on his short list to become his running mate during the 2020 campaign.
 Biden is also nominating Denis McDonough, who was Obama’s White House chief of staff, as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, a sprawling agency that has presented organizational challenges for both parties over the years. But he never served in the armed forces, a fact noted by a leading veterans organization.
 In selecting Rice and McDonough, Biden is continuing to stockpile his administration with prominent members of the Obama administration. He will make the formal announcements Friday, along with his nominations of Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Katherine Tai as U.S. trade representative and Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary. Vilsack filled that same role during Obama’s two terms.
 “The roles they will take on are where the rubber meets the road — where competent and crisis-tested governance can make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, enhancing the dignity, equity, security, and prosperity of the day-to-day lives of Americans,” Biden said in a statement.
 In choosing Rice to oversee the White House council, advisers said Biden is signaling the importance of domestic policy in his early agenda. Though the council was created with the intention of being on par with the White House National Security Council, it traditionally has had a lower public profile, including for its directors.
 Rice is expected to be more of a force, both inside and outside the White House, and her appointment creates a new power center in the West Wing. She’s discussed replicating some elements of the National Security Council in her new role, including a principals committee of Cabinet secretaries and others that could bring more structure to domestic policymaking, but also pull more power into the West Wing.
 She’s expected to play an active role in the Biden administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Health care, immigration and tackling racial inequality are also expected to be among the top issues for the domestic policy shop next year.
 The 56-year-old Rice will be among the most prominent Black women in Biden’s administration. Rice was also in the running to become Biden’s running mate before he picked California Sen. Kamala Harris.
 Since then, Rice has been discussing other roles with the Biden team and was initially seen as a contender for secretary of state. But as a longtime target of Republicans, her prospects for a Cabinet position faded after the election, given the close makeup of the Senate. A pair of runoffs in Georgia next month will determine which party has control, but either configuration will be exceedingly close.
 Rice’s role overseeing the council does not require Senate confirmation.
 Although Biden has insisted his administration will not simply be a retread of Obama’s presidency, he is bringing back numerous familiar faces. His team has defended the moves as a nod toward experience and the need to hit the ground running in tackling the pressing issues facing the nation across multiple fronts.
 Shirley Anne Warshaw, a professor at Gettysburg College who has studied the presidency and Cabinets, said following Obama as he builds out his team gives Biden an advantage.
 “This is a much better bench than Obama had because these people have the experience of serving in the Obama administration,” Warshaw said. “In that way, Joe Biden is the luckiest man in the world.”
 McDonough, the VA nominee, is an experienced manager who was chief of staff throughout Obama’s second term. McDonough was previously Obama’s deputy national security adviser, including during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, and was a longtime congressional staffer.
 McDonough was credited with helping Obama try to bridge divides on Capitol Hill, including around one of his most substantial second-term legislative achievements: the Veterans Choice Act. The legislation, for which President Donald Trump tries to take credit, gave former service members more options to seek care and the VA secretary more authority to fire underperforming staffers.
 The bill came about following exposes during the Obama administration into mismanagement at some VA hospitals and mounting complaints by advocacy groups. As chief of staff, McDonough was also deeply involved in an overhaul of VA leadership after the scandals, which led to the ouster of the department’s secretary.
 “We are surprised by this pick. No way to deny that,” said Joe Chenelly, national executive director of AMVETS, or American Veterans. “We were expecting a veteran, maybe a post-9/11 veteran. Maybe a woman veteran. Or maybe a veteran who knows the VA exceptionally well. We are looking forward to hearing from President-Elect Biden on his thinking behind this nomination.”
 McDonough’s wife, Kari, co-founded the nonprofit group Vets’ Community Connections, which helps veterans and their families develop stronger ties to their communities.
 Biden is balancing numerous priorities as he fills out his Cabinet, including making good on his pledge to have a diverse group of top advisers. That’s created some tensions over top jobs, including agriculture secretary.
 Allies of Fudge made no secret of their desire for her to lead the department, given its oversight of food stamps and other programs meant to address food insecurity — one of her longtime priorities. Instead, Biden went with Vilsack, a longtime friend and advocate for Democrats paying more attention to rural America.
 A transition official said Vilsack and Fudge spoke Wednesday to lay the groundwork for cooperation between their two agencies on those and other initiatives.

"articleBody" : "Potato processors have been given the go-ahead for use of sprout suppressant DMN following fears growers could have been left without a market for their crops.The approval of dimethylnaphthalene (DMN) is limited to the supply chains of some major processors, AHDB, which secured the emergency authorisation (EA), says.The Chemical Regulations Division (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) turned down an original wider application made in August.Approval has instead been granted for controlled use of the sprout control product on a limited number of varieties, pre-nominated by member companies of the Potato Processors Association (PPA).The treated varieties will be used for crisp and French fry manufactures, and a limited tonnage can only be used from long-term storage to supply the nominating companies.DMN will be applied to stored crops by contractors who are members of the National Association of Agricultural Contractors’ (NAAC) Post-Harvest Treatment Group.To qualify for treatment, under the EA, other sprout control products must be known not to have worked or be able to work, AHDB explains.Crops will also be tested to ensure they meet eligibility criteria agreed with CRD as a condition of the approval.Potatoes may only be supplied to factories where the waste will be segregated as part of a stewardship process.This is because it is also a condition of the EA that treated potatoes cannot be used to feed livestock.Adrian Cunnington, Head of Crop Storage Research at AHDB said that without access to DMN for the final three months of storage, the crisping sector would’ve had to resort to bringing crops in from overseas to fulfil the storage-gap.\"We estimate this would have cost £20 million and left British growers without a market for their crops,\" he added.“Gaining this EA has been a long and complex process, especially when you include our original application made in the summer that would have covered over 500,000 tonnes of potatoes – but we are glad to have got it over the line in the nick of time.“AHDB applies for 70% of the emergency approvals in the potato and horticulture sectors, and has robust research programmes to show that other products do not work in certain situations.”An application for full UK approval of Sightä, the product containing DMN, has been submitted to CRD by manufacturer DormFresh and is currently under consideration.It is hoped that this product will become more widely available for the whole industry to use once fully approved, and also that waste segregation will not be necessary.It is currently authorised for use in eight European countries.",

“Even if it is in a remote setting, there were different ways that we reached out to the children. If they can’t follow along in the remote setting or that remote setting wasn’t the best for them, we would do a one-on-one phone call or would do a one on one Google session with them,” said Joanne Poitier, Special Ed at Benjamin Franklin.
 “All our students had access to Google Classroom so that they could get their instructions through videos. The videos allowed the children to stop and pause and take as much time as they needed to get through them and this accommodation works well for a lot of our students and we provided extended time to turn in work,” Poitier said.

 Rebecca Riess, a mother of two boys on the autism spectrum – one of whom also is diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – has run the gamut of special education programs in the Southeast Valley trying to get the best education for her boys.
 “I have not seen any good special education programs to be real honest, before and during COVID-19,” Riess said. “I have had them in public school, private school and charter schools and nobody offers a specific program geared to a kid with autism unless they attend an autistic specialty school.
 “Maybe they might offer it, but I haven’t run into one of those and the opportunities that I have been given have never been specifically geared towards autism,” said Riess.
 Riess had her boys enrolled in brick-and-mortar schools when COVID-19 hit and both schools were unable to keep up with the IEP needs of either son.
 She ended up finding them online platforms that cater to special needs students and said that while she still does not receive additional support as a parent from the school, at least the boys are somewhere that they can focus and achieve.
 “I’m just treading water, trying to keep them on the rails like every other parent trying to keep them focused on what they need to do on a day to day basis,” Riess said.

Now, this would almost certainly be a non-starter from Brooklyn's point of view, because breaking up the Durant-Irving pairing before the former ever got a chance to take the floor seems completely out of the realm of possibility. This does, however, hammer home that Houston is negotiating from a place of strength for now, as Harden is under contract for two more years and they are under no obligation to make a move. Whether this changes as the year begins and the market for his services does something the Rockets don't expect is one thing, but if they are steadfast that a deal centered around guys like Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen and a whole lot of picks isn't enough, it seems hard to imagine that Harden will get to Brooklyn via a trade between the two teams.

In the gospel of Luke in chapter 1 we are introduced to a man by the name of Zachariah. He was a priest and would soon become the father of John the Baptist. He and the people of God had waited for the promised messiah for 700 years, and nothing had happened. However, this day in Luke chapter 1 would be life changing. You see it's important to note that this day was already the most important day of Zechariah's life. A priest could go years without pulling Temple duty; there were that many priests in Jerusalem. But Zechariah was about to have a dream come true. Not only had his name been drawn for Temple duty, but he was assigned to offer incense, which was a once-in-a- lifetime privilege. When a priest offered incense, he was just outside the Veil, behind which was the Holy of Holies where the Shekinah Glory of God's presence was manifest. Only the high priest got closer to the revealed presence of God, and that was only once a year. Jewish tradition described a priest who gets to offer the incense as "rich and holy" for the rest of his life.

Eskom warned on Thursday that while no load shedding was immediately anticipated, there was a "high probability" should any further capacity be lost.
 The system was severely constrained, Eskom said in a statement shortly before 18:00.
 This was caused by the loss of multiple generation units and high load losses, as well as generation units that were already in planned maintenance - the latter alone amounting to over 7 500 MW. Over 10 800 MW of capacity was out on unplanned maintenance, Eskom said.
 Teams were "working around the clock", it added.

 "It was moving to see elderly people with tears in their eyes as they considered the impact of the vaccine for a lot of people who've been forgotten about and shut away."
 "Even I was sceptical back in March that a vaccine could be produced so quickly", she admitted.
 "But once these vaccines have been around for a couple of years, I think we will see that they are, in fact, quite reassuring.
 "The problem is we have forgotten how devastating infectious diseases can be. Vaccinations have got rid of childhood diseases like polio, which were previously so devastating."

 # Gaston DA warns troubled club
 Adam Orr
 The Gaston Gazette
 Gaston County District Attorney Locke Bell warned a Union Road restaurant and night club last month that it was in danger of being deemed a nuisance following a shooting that injured six people.
 That warning is as far as Bell said he's gone on Wednesday with regard to Remedies Restaurant and Night Club. Remedies, at 1225 Union Road, was the site of a shooting and its chaotic aftermath on Nov. 12. Two Gastonia Police officers were injured in the gunfire, along with four other patrons.
 Police later charged Alonzo Lewis Hamilton, 30, and Allen Slaughter, 29, both of Charlotte, each with six counts of felony assault with a deadly weapon in the incident.
 "When a company is notified that there is a nuisance, they have to stop the nuisance," Bell said. "If they stop, then they're in conformity with the law and we would go no further with it."
 Following last month's warning, Bell said no additional complaints have been made regarding Remedies.
 "If we continue to find things wrong or violations of the nuisance statute, then we'd take action," Bell said. "We have not done that."
 Attempts to reach Remedies ownership Wednesday were not immediately successful.
 Security camera footage captured a Remedies employee who wasn’t working Nov. 12, punching a man, which sparked a brawl between 20 to 30 people on the bar’s patio, according to police affidavits.
 Gastonia Police Sgt. E. Nelson and Officer M. Lewis, who were both working security at the club that night, intervened and attempted to break up the fight.
 During the incident a man fired a gun into the crowd.
 Nelson, 35, and Lewis, 41, were working off-duty at the time. Four other Remedies patrons were also injured by gunfire Thursday night, including Laquan Keech of Kannapolis, Anthony Davis of Grover, Jaerel Campbell of Concord and Ralchael Williams of Charlotte. None of the injuries for the six were life- threatening.
 The club has seen heavy police presence over the past two years, including more than 200 calls for service - a figure which includes more than 20 civil disturbances and nearly a dozen assaults.
 Last month, the Alcohol Beveridge Commission had charges filed against Alisa Dawn Edwards, ABC permit holder and Remedies owner, with failure to superintend and knowingly allow violations of ABC law to occur and on Nov. 14.
 The North Carolina Alcohol Beverage Control Commission summarily suspended the nightclub's alcohol sales permits.

 # ‘Under the rug:’ Sexual misconduct shakes FBI’s senior ranks
 Jim Mustian
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ – An assistant FBI director retired after he was accused of drunkenly groping a female subordinate in a stairwell. Another senior FBI official left after he was found to have sexually harassed eight employees. Yet another high-ranking FBI agent retired after he was accused of blackmailing a young employee into sexual encounters.
 An Associated Press investigation has identified at least six sexual misconduct allegations involving senior FBI officials over the past five years, including two new claims brought this week by women who say they were sexually assaulted by ranking agents.
 Each of the accused FBI officials appears to have avoided discipline, the AP found, and several were quietly transferred or retired, keeping their full pensions and benefits even when probes substantiated the sexual misconduct claims against them.
 Beyond that, federal law enforcement officials are afforded anonymity even after the disciplinary process runs its course, allowing them to land on their feet in the private sector or even remain in law enforcement.
 “They’re sweeping it under the rug,” said a former FBI analyst who alleges in a new federal lawsuit that a supervisory special agent licked her face and groped her at a colleague’s farewell party in 2017. She ended up leaving the FBI and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
 “As the premier law enforcement organization that the FBI holds itself out to be, it’s very disheartening when they allow people they know are criminals to retire and pursue careers in law enforcement-related fields,” said the woman, who asked to be identified in this story only by her first name, Becky.
 The AP’s count does not include the growing number of high-level FBI supervisors who have failed to report romantic relationships with subordinates in recent years – a pattern that has alarmed investigators with the Office of Inspector General and raised questions about bureau policy.
 The recurring sexual misconduct has drawn the attention of Congress and advocacy groups, which have called for whistleblower protections for rank-and- file FBI employees and for an outside entity to review the bureau’s disciplinary cases.
 “They need a #MeToo moment,” said U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who has been critical of the treatment of women in the male-dominated FBI.
 “It’s repugnant, and it underscores the fact that the FBI and many of our institutions are still good ol’-boy networks,” Speier said. “It doesn’t surprise me that, in terms of sexual assault and sexual harassment, they are still in the Dark Ages.”
 In a statement, the FBI said it “maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment” and that claims against supervisors have resulted in them being removed from their positions while cases are investigated and adjudicated.
 It added that severe cases can result in criminal charges and that the FBI’s internal disciplinary process assesses, among other factors, “the credibility of the allegations, the severity of the conduct, and the rank and position of the individuals involved.”
 The AP review of court records, Office of Inspector General reports and interviews with federal law enforcement officials identified at least six allegations against senior officials, including an assistant director and special agents in charge of entire field offices, that ranged from unwanted touching and sexual advances to coercion.
 None appears to have been disciplined, but another sexual misconduct allegation identified in the AP review of a rank-and-file agent resulted in him losing his security clearance.
 The FBI, with more than 35,000 employees, keeps a notoriously tight lid on such allegations. The last time the Office of Inspector General did an extensive probe of sexual misconduct within the FBI, it tallied 343 “offenses” from fiscal years 2009 to 2012, including three instances of “videotaping undressed women without consent.”
 The latest claims come months after a 17th woman joined a federal lawsuit alleging systemic sexual harassment at the FBI’s training academy in Quantico, Virginia. That class-action case claims male FBI instructors made “sexually charged” comments about women needing to “take their birth control to control their moods,” inviting women trainees over to their homes and openly disparaging them.
 In one of the new lawsuits filed Wednesday, a former FBI employee identified only as “Jane Doe” alleged a special agent in charge in 2016 retired without discipline and opened a law firm even after he “imprisoned, tortured, harassed, blackmailed, stalked and manipulated” her into having several “non- consensual sexual encounters,” including one in which he forced himself on her in a car. The AP is withholding the name and location of the accused special agent to protect the woman’s identity.
 “It is the policy and practice of the FBI and its OIG to allow senior executives accused of sexual assault to quietly retire with full benefits without prosecution,” the woman’s attorney, David J. Shaffer, alleges in the lawsuit.
 One such case involved Roger C. Stanton, who before his abrupt retirement served as assistant director of the Insider Threat Office, a division at Washington headquarters tasked with rooting out leakers and safeguarding national security information.
 According to an Inspector General’s report concluded this year and obtained by AP through a public records request, Stanton was accused of drunkenly driving a female subordinate home following an after-work happy hour. The woman told investigators that once inside a stairwell of her apartment building, Stanton wrapped his arm around her waist and “moved his hand down onto her bottom” before she was able to get away and hustle up the stairs.
 After Stanton left, he called the woman 15 times on her FBI phone and sent her what investigators described as “garbled text” complaining that he could not find his vehicle. The heavily redacted report does not say when the incident happened.
 Stanton disputed the woman’s account and told investigators he “did not intend to do anything” and only placed his arm around her because of the “narrowness” of the stairs. But Stanton acknowledged he was “very embarrassed by this event” and “assistant directors should not be putting themselves in these situations.”
 Stanton retired in late 2018 after the investigation determined he sexually harassed the woman and sought an improper relationship. He did not respond to requests for comment from AP.
 Earlier this year, the Inspector General found that the special agent in charge of the Albany, New York, office, James N. Hendricks, sexually harassed eight subordinates at the FBI.
 Hendricks also was not named in the OIG report despite its findings. He was first identified in September by the Albany Times Union. One current and one former colleague of Hendricks confirmed his role in the case to AP.
 Hendricks now writes a law enforcement blog in which he touts his FBI accolades but makes no mention of the misconduct allegations. He did not respond to requests for comment.
 Becky, the former analyst, told AP she once believed FBI’s “organizational values and mission aligned with how I was raised.” But she was disabused of that notion after reporting to management that Charles Dick, a supervisory special agent at the FBI Training Academy at the time, sexually assaulted her at a farewell party.
 Becky told AP her assailant had threatened her at least two times before. “Once while we were waiting for the director he said, ‘I’m going to touch your ass. You know it’s going to happen.’”
 “His boorish behavior was well known,” she added. “He was getting away with everything.”
 In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Becky accused the former agent of wrapping his arm around her chest while posing for a photograph and “reaching under her and simulating” penetration of her “with his fingers through her jeans.”
 Dick denied the charges and was acquitted in state court in Virginia by a judge who ruled it “wholly incredible” that Becky would “stand there and take it and not say anything,” according to a transcript of the proceeding. Dick retired from the FBI months before the Inspector General followed up on Becky’s internal complaint, Becky alleged in her lawsuit, adding she faced retaliation for coming forward.
 “It’s much easier to suffer in isolation than it is to go public,” she told AP. “But if I don’t report it, I’m complicit in the cultural and institutionalized cover-up of this sort of behavior.”

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — NASA says a newly launched European-U.S. satellite designed to continue a decades-long record of tracking global sea levels has sent back its first measurements. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite was launched Nov. 21 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Controllers spent several weeks activating instruments and making sure operations were normal. NASA says Thursday that the first measurements provided information on sea surface height, wave height and wind speed off the southern tip of Africa. Later this month, Sentinel-6 will be moved higher from an initial orbit to its operational orbit.
