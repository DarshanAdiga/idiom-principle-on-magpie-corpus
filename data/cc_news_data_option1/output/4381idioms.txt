The Shiv Nadar Foundation launched its third initiative in the field of higher education - the Shiv Nadar University, Chennai.
 The University is the first private University to be legislated in Tamil Nadu after 90 years (since Annamalai University Act in 1928), upon the passing of the Shiv Nadar University Act 2018. R.

 "My father received his education from this state (Tamil Nadu). If it has not been for his education he received his dream of setting up a global organisation like HCL would not have become a reality," said Roshni Nadar Malhotra, Chairperson, HCL Technologies and Trustee, Shiv Nadar Foundation. “My father, Mr Shiv Nadar, is a product of education and strongly believes in its power to transform people’s lives. Shiv Nadar University Chennai will be a catalyst for new research, novel discoveries and creation of new forms of expression…eventually helping create responsible, well rounded citizens," she added.
 The University also plans to introduce a four-year undergraduate program in Business Management (BMS) in the following academic year (2022 – 23). "Over the next five years, Shiv Nadar University Chennai will continue to introduce new programs and expand its offerings, including establishing a School of Law at the University," Mr R Srinivasan, Founding Chancellor, Shiv Nadar University Chennai said.

The rainforest of Lope National Park in central Gabon is one of the last safe havens for the endangered forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). But in a new study in Science, researchers warn that elephants and other keystone species in the park, such as western lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, and mandrills, could be facing famine. Climate change is disrupting the yield of fruit trees, a critical food source for many larger mammals. Scientists from Gabon's national parks agency (ANPN) and the University of Stirling in Scotland, found a staggering 81% decline in fruit production in the protected area between 1986 and 2018. Their analysis of an extensive photographic database covering a twenty-year period showed a critical decline in weight and body fat of forest elephants. An 11% decline in the body condition of forest elephants since 2008 is primarily attributed to decreased fruit consumption. The researchers draw on a rare longitudinal data set funded by the EU's ECOFAC-6 programme and collected by the ANPN. Every month for 34 years, botanists observed the crowns of more than 2,000 tropical trees and scanned the canopy for flowers, leaves, and both ripe and unripe fruits of 73 species important to the diet of elephants, gorillas and chimpanzees. "The changes are drastic," says Emma Bush, co-lead author of the study. "The massive collapse in fruiting may be due to missing the environmental cue to bear fruit." Some tropical trees depend on a drop in temperature to trigger flowering, but since the 1980s, the region recorded less…This article was originally published on Mongabay

The Bledisloe Cup is held annually between the Wallabies and the All Blacks. Photo: VCG
 New Zealand haven't had to wrap up the Bledisloe Cup on Australian soil in 11 years and for coach Ian Foster that's a massive motivation to snuff out Wallaby hopes of keeping the series alive when the two sides meet Saturday in Sydney.      After a 16-16 draw at the opening game in Wellington, it was back to business as usual for the All Blacks at their Eden Park fortress in Auckland, where they won 27-7.      It means Australia must win on Saturday to stand any chance of lifting the trans-Tasman trophy for the first time since 2002 at the fourth and final game in Brisbane on November 7.      While the match is the third Bledisloe fixture, it is also the first game of the Tri ­Nations - the former Rugby Championship, ­rebranded after world champions South Africa pulled out - also ­including Argentina.      In the hosts' favor is that New Zealand have not won the Cup in Australia since 2009, and that they have come out on top in two of their previous three matches against them at home, including a 47-26 walloping in Perth last year.      "None of our players, even our experienced ones, have had to win the trophy in Australia," said Foster ahead of Saturday's game. "In the past the deciding game has always been in New Zealand, so I think it's a great challenge for us."      "It's a real chance for us to come into their home patch, a place which they take a lot of pride in playing and for a trophy which means a lot to them, and we need to show them how much it means to us," he added.      New Zealand have made three changes to the run-on side, handing No.8 Hoskins Sotutu a starting debut, welcoming back veteran lock Sam Whitelock and recalling prop Karl Tu'inukuafe.      Whitelock returns after missing the Auckland Test with concussion, the same injury that has kept Joe Moody out of Saturday's fixture, opening the way for Tu'inukuafe.      Sotutu comes in for Ardie Savea, who is on paternity leave, while all eyes will be on their new weapon, young wing Caleb Clarke whose rampaging runs in Auckland sparked comparisons to the great Jonah Lomu.      Faced with Clarke and the ever-present danger posed by Beauden Barrett, Australia have their work cut out, with coach Dave Rennie desperate for his team to cut down on missed tackles and turnovers.      Australia head into the game without experienced pair Matt To'omua and James O'Connor, who are injured - potentially a crushing blow.      Rennie has drafted in debutants Noah Lolesio at fly-half and Irae Simone at inside center to take their place, while dumping fullback Tom Banks for veteran Dane Haylett-Petty.      The explosive Jordan Petaia will play his first Test in Australia after being preferred to Hunter Paisami at outside centre, while Allan Alaalatoa got the nod ahead of Taniela Tupou at tight-head prop.      "We're [keeping] an eye to the future but also about winning on Saturday," said Rennie of his decision to blood new talent, with two other debutants - Fraser McReight and Tate McDermott - on the bench.      "We're going to get a lot better over time, but you've got to get results now too and we're well aware of the quality of the opposition," he said.      Because of coronavirus concerns, Australia are hosting the entire Tri Nations. The Wallabies and All Blacks will both play Argentina twice, with the last game on December 5.

Stephen Bradley feels that the FAI need to give managers and coaches more of a say in the direction of Irish football and the League of Ireland. The Shamrock Rovers boss has praised the Abbotstown hierarchy for some of the on-the-field changes they have overseen, including the national underage leagues that have proved contentious in some circles.Bradley is a strong backer of that plan and - in a lengthy interview on the LOI Weekly podcast - offered the view that there should be a countrywide division that starts at a younger age than the divisive U-13 level.However, the league- winning manager holds the view that football people need a greater input in decisions around strategies and formats for the league, which are due to take place in the coming months, with uncertainty hanging over the 2021 season on account of Covid-19 concerns.&quot;I don't feel we're asked our opinion enough,&quot; said Bradley, &quot;Stephen Henderson (Shels coach) has done tremendous work setting up a managers association. I know it's still not where he wants it to be but it's definitely something that needs to be in place.&quot;I just think that when football decisions are being made that affect everyone, the coaches and managers deserve an input. I don't think we get one. We get things relayed through your club.&quot;The secretary or someone from your club will go and represent the club but, for me, that's not good enough. I don't see the harm in inviting managers into a room and having a chat and saying 'this is where we're going and what's your opinion on it.' We won't all agree. That's fine.&quot;I understand we might have an opinion and someone might come back with a financial reason why it's not possible. But we should be asked for one.&quot;Bradley said the discussion around the FAI needs to look to the future after the turbulence of the end of the John Delaney era and he says new CEO Jonathan Hill should be supported.&quot;What went on off the pitch, it's happened now. It's wrong, what went on was scandalous but we've got to give the new CEO a chance and hope they can bring us forward&quot;On the pitch, there's some really good work going on behind the scenes. Ruud Dokter deserves tremendous credit for the national leagues. It's a positive step.

We're in a good place. But off the pitch we need to improve.&quot;In a wide-ranging chat, Bradley also spoke of Rovers' future plans after ending their nine-year wait for the trophy, asserting that his group of players are only getting started and would have hit another level this year if they'd been given a full season to show what they can do.He admitted that they will have to plan for 2021 scenarios both with and without Jack Byrne, with the Ireland international sure to be the subject of winter interest.Bradley added that other clubs should be looking to follow the lead of Rovers by entering a second team in the First Division.

Expressing serious concern over the law and order matter, Dhankar said terror groups like al-Qaeda were spreading their tentacles in the state while the IAS and IPS officers have abdicated their responsibility.   Speaking to reporters in the national capital, he said, "I could never imagine that there could be such abdication of authority by senior members of IAS and IPS. We have a state security advisor who is a retired DGP, what does he do? Is he there only to carry out political acts?"  
 "al-Qaeda is spreading its fangs, people being arrested. We have illegal bomb- making...and bombs are freely flying in every event, being carried even in ambulances. So what are these people doing?" he asked further.

Dhankhar is on an official visit to Delhi from Oct 28-30. He met Union Home Minister Amit Shah at his residence today.

The public are losing faith in the police as many offenders are not brought to justice, a report has found.
 Ex-officer Alan told LBC that the problem lies within the structure and management of the force itself. He pointed out that if a company was losing countless workers, they would question why - yet the same is not being done in this sector.
 Officers are leaving "a lot sooner" than the thirty year mark, which is when an officer earns the right to a lifetime pension, and instead people may be leaving two or three years before that time.
 "They've got a countdown on their job computer telling them exactly how many days they've got to work," Alan said.
 "The reason why they're doing that is they're sick to the back teeth of working for spineless people, and it's great being able to say that now and out of the job," Alan said, explaining that when he worked in the transport unit at the Metropolitan Police his superintendent wanted officers on buses surveying people about their journey instead of arresting people.
 He told Nick that that to add fuel to the fire, the organisation now has people coming in to it who "six weeks ago were packing shelves in Asda" and are simply handed a detective badge.

With these lines drawn in the sand, the conventional wisdom was that both the Israelis and the Palestinians would need to be compensated for historic wrongs in order to guarantee stability and peace in the Middle East. The Israeli- Palestinian conflict was the key to unlocking a process of diplomatic normalization across the region. Thus, by agreeing to normalize relations with Israel in the absence of a deal for the Palestinians, the UAE has essentially swept all of this history under the rug. Its embrace of the Abraham Accords, where it was quickly joined by Bahrain, marks a regional paradigm shift.
 In recent years, Arab elites’ threat perceptions have changed. If their primary enemy in the 1960s and 1970s was Israel, today it is Iran, followed by Turkey. As the United States has pulled back from the region, many Gulf leaders have come to believe that a regional axis with Israel will be crucial to safeguarding their interests. And on the Arab street — where most of the population had not yet been born when Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin agreed on a path to a two-state solution — public opinion has followed suit. Moreover, in recent years, the Palestinians have been out-victimized by other waves of oppression and violence, whether in Iraq after the U.S. invasion, in Libya under Muammar el-Qaddafi, or in the conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
 The UAE leadership is surprisingly frank about its decision to make peace with Israel. While it continues to support the idea of a Palestinian state, it no longer trusts the Palestinian leadership to leverage Emirati support effectively. In response, Palestinian critics argue that the UAE has thrown away the most powerful card that could be played on their behalf. But the reality is that the UAE, like most others in the region, has wider interests beyond creating a Palestinian homeland. Strengthening ties with the U.S., and securing U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, is a higher priority. As Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz put it this month, “The Palestinian cause is a just cause, but its advocates are failures, and the Israeli cause is unjust but its advocates have proven to be successful.”
 For their part, the Israelis are hoping that the Abraham Accords will open the way for a new wave of normalization with other Arab powers, so that the road to regional security will no longer run through Jerusalem. By separating the Palestinian question from relations with other countries in the region, Israel has managed to turn it into merely a domestic problem. The “international community’s” position on the issue will now be more diffuse, and thus weaker. With each new normalization accord that Israel secures, it will gain an ever- more explicit endorsement from the Arab world.
 The deals with the UAE and Bahrain thus amount to a triumph for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy of the past decade. But Netanyahu would do well to remember that a victory in the Middle East always contains the seeds of its unraveling. If he makes the two-state solution impossible, he will have laid the groundwork for a challenge to Israel’s future as a Jewish- majority democratic state.
 After all, if the Palestinians can no longer negotiate for their own state, their best alternative will be to pursue a one-state solution by pressing for civil rights within Israel. The writing is on the wall. According to the United Nations’ 2019 demographic profile of the Palestinian territories, there are five million Palestinians who could potentially join with the 1,916,000 Arabs living in Israel, thus outnumbering the 6,772,000 Israeli Jews.
 Considering how ineffective and divided the Palestinian leadership is, an organized challenge seems unlikely anytime soon. Yet long before Palestinians become capable of winning an electoral majority in Israel, a more competent leadership could start to raise serious questions about the health of Israeli democracy itself. Such arguments would reignite debates about whether Israel is an apartheid state, potentially leading to a renewal of international pressure. And that, in turn, could have far-reaching implications for how other powers relate to Israel, not least the European Union, which accounts for about one-third of the country’s total trade.
 For these reasons, leading Israeli national-security analysts have argued that if a negotiated two-state solution is not possible, Israel should develop an unnegotiated one, by establishing a viable Palestinian state unilaterally. But this approach would seem to require a complete re-configuration of the occupation in the interest of settler maximalization, which could fatally undermine the legitimacy of any eventual Palestinian state. That is why other Israeli leaders with a more strategic outlook — including six former Mossad directors — have begun to look for ways to develop real statehood for the Palestinians through a process of de-occupation.
 If Netanyahu fails to develop a viable Palestinian state, his escape from history could prove very short-lived. As William Faulkner observed, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”

       China still have a period of important strategic opportunities for its development, although both opportunities and challenges the country faces have changed, reads the communique of the fifth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) released on Thursday      The communique was passed at the session in Beijing from October 26 to 29.      The plenum analyzed the profound and complex changes in China's development environment. It concluded that the world is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation are being evolved and developed.      The balance of international forces has adjusted, but peace and development are still the themes of the times.      The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, but the uncertainties in international community have increased significantly.      China has shifted to a stage of high-quality development, with significant institutional advantages, improved governance efficiency, long-term economic improvement, solid material foundation, abundant human resources, broad market space, strong development resilience, overall social stability, and multiple advantages and conditions for continued development.      At the same time, the problem of inadequate development in China remains prominent, and the reform tasks in key areas are still arduous. For example, the innovation ability does not meet the requirements of high-quality development, agricultural foundation is unstable, the gap between urban and rural regional development and income distribution is large, ecological and environmental protection has a long way to go, and there are shortcomings in the livelihood environment and weaknesses in social governance.      The plenum requires the CPC to formulate a deep understanding of the new characteristics and requirements brought about by changes in society, and to understand the new contradictions and challenges brought about by the complicated international environment.      It also requires the Party to enhance awareness of opportunities and risks, maintain strategic determination, and focus on our own affairs. It also requests the Party to promote a fighting spirit, seize opportunities and respond to challenges.      Global Times

Australian scientists found a detached coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef that exceeds the height of the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower, the Schmidt Ocean Institute said this week, the first such discovery in over 100 years. The “blade like” reef is nearly 500 metres tall and 1.5 kilometres wide, said the institute.
 It lies 40 metres below the ocean surface and about six kilometres from the edge of Great Barrier Reef.
 A team of scientists from James Cook University, led by Dr. Robin Beaman, were mapping the northern seafloor of the Great Barrier Reef on board the institutes research vessel Falkor, when they found the reef on October 20. “We are surprised and elated by what we have found,” said Beaman.
 He said it was the first detached reef of that size to be discovered in over 120 years and that it was thriving with a “blizzard of fish” in a healthy ecosystem.
