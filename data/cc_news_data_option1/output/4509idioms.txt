The Job Retention Scheme, which was introduced alongside the national lockdown in March and helped keep a lid on unemployment, was due to expire at the end of October and to be replaced by a less generous program. However, it was reinstated on Saturday when the government abruptly announced another lockdown for England to last until Dec. 2.
 The lockdown will see millions of workers going idle once again as it requires all non-essential venues such as pubs, restaurants, and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, to close. The support package for self- employed workers was also made more generous.
 “It’s clear the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses than the duration of any restrictions, which is why we have decided to go further with our support,” Sunak told lawmakers.
 The extension was welcomed by all types of businesses as it relieves the pressure on them in what would traditionally be the busiest and financially most important time of the year — the run-up to Christmas.
 “Hospitality is facing a tough winter, so this enhanced support is crucial and will safeguard jobs and help businesses to plan for more certain future,” said Kate Nicholls, CEO of the U.K. Hospitality lobby group.
 The Bank of England estimates that the number of people on furlough will more than double in November to 5.5 million. At the height of the program in the spring, around 9 million workers, or around a third of the workforce, were on furlough.
 The government had for months balked at calls for an extension, arguing it wasn’t its role to support every job in the economy forever. It was no doubt also concerned about the cost of the program, which has reached 40 billion pounds.
 While welcoming the move, the main opposition Labour Party criticized Sunak for failing to act sooner, a delay that it says generated uncertainty and prompted some firms to dismiss staff in recent weeks. The government said the furlough scheme could be backdated so anyone who was on a payroll on Sept. 23 but then made redundant, can be re-employed.
 “This cycle of bluster, denial and then running to catch up is costing jobs and causing chaos,” said Labour’s economy spokeswoman, Anneliese Dodds.
 Though the furlough program prevented mass unemployment, the jobless rate has edged up from a four-decade low of 3.8% to 4.5%, with the likes of British Airways, Royal Mail and Rolls-Royce all laying off thousands.
 On Thursday, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s became the latest big company to announce hefty cuts. It said it will shed around 3,500 jobs as part of plans to permanently close its meat, fish and deli counters, as well as some of its Argos standalone stores.
 Sunak’s latest change came after the Bank of England warned that the British economy is set for another downturn in the winter, with the economy forecast to contract a further 2% in the fourth quarter. It laid out the hope that a recession — widely defined as two straight quarters of contraction — may be avoided but said the outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”
 Given that backdrop, its nine-member policymaking panel agreed to increase the bank’s bond-buying program in an attempt to ensure banks carry on lending to the wider economy. The stimulus was bigger than the 100 billion pounds anticipated in financial markets. The Monetary Policy Committee also unanimously kept the bank’s main interest rate at a record low of 0.1%.
 “We believe there is value in acting quickly and strongly to support the economy and avoid the risks of any short-term disruption,” Bank Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The venerable New Orleans funk band Galactic purchased the historic music club Tipitina’s in late November 2018 and, according to bassist Robert Mercurio, was making a go of it. “It’s a tight- margin business but we were making our notes and fulfilling our bills and whatnot. So, it was moving along in a good direction,” he said. That was before the coronavirus pandemic forced shutdowns of public gatherings. Audiences last packed into Tipitina's for a March 12 performance by the Stooges Brass Band. Now, Mercurio is worried that COVID-19 could prove fatal to Tipitina's, a New Orleans cultural touchstone founded in the 1970s as the performance home for the late Henry Roeland Byrd, better known as rhythm and blues keyboard genius Professor Longhair. For Mercurio, the problem is twofold. Galactic is a band with nowhere to tour and a business whose operating model — packing hordes of people in front of a stage for hours — doesn't work in a pandemic. “It's terrifying,” he said. “It's extremely difficult to be a now-nonworking musician owning an unopened nightclub.” Such fears aren't limited to New Orleans. Independent music clubs all over the nation — pop culture icons like the Troubadour in West Hollywood; the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, Tennessee; The Bitter End in New York's Greenwich Village — are shuttered. And owners fear for the future of their businesses and of a musical way of life. “There's no amount of history or legendary status that will protect you,” Audrey Fix Schaefer said. She is a spokesperson for the National Independent Venue Association, which was formed in the wake of the pandemic to raise awareness and money for the newly struggling clubs. She points to the iconic jazz club Birdland in New York City....

Those recommended personnel-related cuts are part of the college’s attempt to cut its budget by $4.1 million for the upcoming fiscal year 2022 budget, which starts next July.
 Schaffer originally planned to target around $3.5 million in cuts this year, but in a memo he wrote the board Tuesday, he said the college will need to make even deeper cuts.
 “Unfortunately, over the past few months, we have developed a better understanding of our actual budget impacts, and $3.5 million simply will not cover our anticipated deficits in funding,” he said.
 Schaffer said his budget reduction proposal tilts toward making more cuts now instead of waiting to restructure the budget later.
 “You could decide that the target needs to be less,” Schaffer told the board.
 “The downside is that the lower amount we decide to cut, the greater the risk that we’ll have to go through budget-cutting exercises again. And as I’ve shared, the pressure and the strain on those 33 employees worrying about the outcome of those cuts creates a strained environment and makes it difficult to stay positive while working with students.”
 If and when the state’s economy recovers, Schaffer said he wants to make sure LCCC is ready to keep moving forward as a college, and not held back by financial burdens it can’t support.
 However, Trustee Wendy Soto said morale is already low regarding possible layoffs at the college.
 “I understand, and I’m skeptical about Wyoming’s revenue picture and that it will improve. ... I want to discuss if these cuts are too deep for the moment,” said Soto, who noted that until the Wyoming Legislature finds new sources of revenue, things will remain uncertain.
 “We’re already in a position where we’re anticipating more cuts. Can we send Dr. Schaffer back to the drawing board and develop a plan that is less painful than this?”
 Over the summer, Gov. Mark Gordon directed all state agencies to prepare to cut 10% of their budgets to address an estimated $1.5 billion shortfall to the state’s overall budget. A combination of the rapidly declining mineral industry and the recession created by COVID-19 has created the need to make continued drastic reductions to the college’s budget. The college won’t know exactly how much more it might need to cut until the Legislature adjourns next spring.
 About half of LCCC’s operating budget comes from state-level funding, which has historically come from state mineral revenues. Over the summer, the college used one-time funds to balance a $93.3 million budget – and froze employee raises to make it happen – for fiscal year 2021. Schaffer told the board Wednesday that keeping employee raises frozen in the upcoming budget would save an estimated $656,000.

When All Elite Wrestling first launched in early 2019 both president Tony Khan and executive vice president Cody Rhodes promised the promotion would have a more "sports-centric" presentation compared to what other promotions around the country were offering. That started with AEW putting a heavy emphasis on wins and losses, posting a wrestler's annual record at the start of every match and releasing weekly power rankings in each division.
 "The term people are using is 'alternative,'" Rhodes told _Variety_ back in May 2019, days before AEW's first official event. "For many years throughout my youth and plenty of other fans' youths, pro wrestling has been essentially just one company and that's not really the case. I want to be the sports- centric alternative in the pro wrestling world and I think we're on a good path to get there."
 However, some fans have argued in recent months that the idea has been abandoned, particularly when Chris Jericho and MJF took part in the polarizing "Le Dinner Debonair" musical segment on a recent Dynamite. Khan was asked about that criticism this week in an interview with PWInsider and defended the segment, pointing out how it took place on the same show that featured solid matches like Wardlow vs. Jungle Boy and Rey Fenix vs. Penta El Zero Miedo.
 "I think that segment [Le Dinner Debonair] is sports-oriented," he said. "Like when I watch the ESPYs or when I watch...you watch music videos, it's not unusual to see a big athlete in a musical number, and the key thing to me was that it wasn't done in an unrealistic context because the idea that we ended up settling on to me was a very realistic idea. Chris Jericho and MJF are like two of the biggest showboats in wrestling, they're really cocky guys and of course they would love to sing their own praises and go out and do this hammy performance together because they're both egomaniacs and of course like the ambiance and the whole thing is very on-brand for the two of them.
 "It was also key to me that it was not something behind an invisible camera where these two guys were just having a dinner and they weren't aware they were being filmed and they just broke into a song," he continued. "They were looking into the camera, they were singing to the camera, it was for the fans. Clearly they were doing it for themselves as these characters but it was very much for the benefit of the fans. So it's like to me, in their minds it was for the benefit of the fans. So to me, it's very much...it's still a realistic segment. I don't think it's...people talk about a sports-based feel but I've seen athletes do tons of musical numbers and you know, the Super Bowl Shuffle? Was the Super Bowl Shuffle not real sports? Because that's about as real sports as I can remember. That's an era when sports felt very real and that's the throwback era that all the people complaining about are probably fondly looking back at. So, if you're going to take an honest look at it, look at all the times athletes that have sang and danced in music videos."

Election Expert Sean Trende Says Arizona Is 'Still Up In The Air'

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig has defeated Republican Tyler Kistner in Minnesota’s swing 2nd District. Craig won the seat in 2018 by ousting Republican U.S. Rep. Jason Lewis in a rematch of their 2016 race, in a year that control of the House flipped from Republicans to Democrats. She was a former medical technology executive and former newspaper reporter before turning to politics. She was Minnesota’s first openly gay member of Congress. Kistner, a veteran making his first run for office, campaigned on the slogan “Send in the Marine.” He served four overseas tours during his nine years as a Marine Corps officer. The death of a third-party candidate on the ballot threatened to delay the election by three months.

ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has given the Vatican secretariat of state three months to transfer all of its financial holdings to another Vatican office following its bungled management of hundreds of millions of euros in donations and investments that are now the subject of a corruption investigation.Francis summoned the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, his deputy as well as the Vatican’s top finance officials for a meeting Wednesday and gave them a three-month deadline to complete the transfer, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.The Vatican released the letter that Francis wrote to Parolin on Aug. 25 in which he announced he was stripping the secretariat of state of its ability to independently manage the money.Francis cited the “reputational risks” incurred by the department’s previous investments in speculative operations that have cost the Holy See tens of millions of euros, some of it money from the Peter’s Pence donations from the faithful.Francis' decision was an embarrassing blow to the secretariat of state’s standing as the most powerful Holy See office, reducing it to essentially any other department that must propose a budget and have it approved and monitored by others.Its financial holdings are now to be held by the Vatican’s treasury office, known as APSA and incorporated into the Holy See’s consolidated budget, Francis wrote. The economy ministry will oversee spending.The outcome is essentially that which was sought years ago by Cardinal George Pell, Francis' first economy minister who clashed with the secretariat of state over his financial reforms and efforts to wrest control of the department’s off-the-books funds. He famously boasted in 2014 that he had “discovered” hundreds of millions of euros that were “tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet” — a reference to the secretariat of state’s in-house asset portfolio.Pell had to abandon those reform efforts in 2017 to face trial for sexual abuse in his native Australia, but he was acquitted and returned triumphantly last month to Rome, where he was granted a well-publicized audience with Francis.Francis moved against his own secretariat of state amid a year-long investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the office’s 350-million-euro investment into a London real estate venture.Prosecutors have accused several officials in the department of abusing their authority for their involvement in the deal, as well several Italian middlemen of allegedly fleecing the Vatican of tens of millions of euros in fees.The scandal has exposed the incompetence of the Vatican’s monsignors in managing money, since they signed away voting shares in the deal and agreed to pay exorbitant fees needlessly to Italians who were known in business circles for their shady dealings.In his letter to Parolin, Francis cited the London venture as well as the secretariat of state’s investment in a Malta-based investment vehicle, Centurion Global Fund, headed by the Vatican’s longtime external money manager.According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Centurion invested in such ventures as the “Rocketman” film on Elton John as well as a holding company headed by Lapo Elkann, one of the more flamboyant members of Italy’s Agnelli clan.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 California’s season-opening game Saturday night against Washington is in jeopardy following a positive coronavirus test Wednesday on the Golden Bears that has caused what coach Justin Wilcox said is a “significant” number of players needing contact tracing.

 “If it is feasible for us to play we are going to play the game,” Wilcox said on a Zoom call. “Are there hurdles? There are hurdles, yes. With the players in question the game is in jeopardy. If we have the bodies available to play the game we will play the game. Several people are being held out and that’s a legitimate threat to the game.”
 Wednesday’s practice was limited and some team drills were not doable based on the number of players held out. Wilcox wouldn’t specify how many players were sidelined. The player with a positive COVID-19 test is asymptomatic.

The Job Retention Scheme, which was introduced alongside the national lockdown in March and helped keep a lid on unemployment, was due to expire at the end of October and to be replaced by a less generous program. However, it was reinstated on Saturday when the government abruptly announced another lockdown for England to last until Dec. 2.The lockdown will see millions of workers going idle once again as it requires all non-essential venues such as pubs, restaurants, and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, to close. The support package for self-employed workers was also made more generous.“It’s clear the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses than the duration of any restrictions, which is why we have decided to go further with our support,” Sunak told lawmakers.The extension was welcomed by all types of businesses as it relieves the pressure on them in what would traditionally be the busiest and financially most important time of the year — the run-up to Christmas.“Hospitality is facing a tough winter, so this enhanced support is crucial and will safeguard jobs and help businesses to plan for more certain future,” said Kate Nicholls, CEO of the U.K. Hospitality lobby group.The Bank of England estimates that the number of people on furlough will more than double in November to 5.5 million. At the height of the program in the spring, around 9 million workers, or around a third of the workforce, were on furlough.The government had for months balked at calls for an extension, arguing it wasn’t its role to support every job in the economy forever. It was no doubt also concerned about the cost of the program, which has reached 40 billion pounds.While welcoming the move, the main opposition Labour Party criticized Sunak for failing to act sooner, a delay that it says generated uncertainty and prompted some firms to dismiss staff in recent weeks. The government said the furlough scheme could be backdated so anyone who was on a payroll on Sept. 23 but then made redundant, can be re-employed.“This cycle of bluster, denial and then running to catch up is costing jobs and causing chaos,” said Labour’s economy spokeswoman, Anneliese Dodds.Though the furlough program prevented mass unemployment, the jobless rate has edged up from a four-decade low of 3.8% to 4.5%, with the likes of British Airways, Royal Mail and Rolls-Royce all laying off thousands.On Thursday, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s became the latest big company to announce hefty cuts. It said it will shed around 3,500 jobs as part of plans to permanently close its meat, fish and deli counters, as well as some of its Argos standalone stores.Sunak’s latest change came after the Bank of England warned that the British economy is set for another downturn in the winter, with the economy forecast to contract a further 2% in the fourth quarter. It laid out the hope that a recession — widely defined as two straight quarters of contraction — may be avoided but said the outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”Given that backdrop, its nine-member policymaking panel agreed to increase the bank’s bond-buying program in an attempt to ensure banks carry on lending to the wider economy. The stimulus was bigger than the 100 billion pounds anticipated in financial markets. The Monetary Policy Committee also unanimously kept the bank’s main interest rate at a record low of 0.1%.“We believe there is value in acting quickly and strongly to support the economy and avoid the risks of any short-term disruption,” Bank Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Also, if you form some kind of business alliance with another boss, you can get them to take somebody out for you. The down side of that is that they get all of their empire. You want to whittle down that empire first. On the money aspect of it, pretty much any strategy game is learning how to min-max that. Another way I try to play, there are synergies you can have in the empire. If you have two or three of a specific business, that will give you a synergy. It all has to be in the same neighborhood. There are five different synergies, and then you can buy a hotel. At that hotel, the concierge will funnel people into your businesses. That will give you extra draw. This is the nerdy level I go to.

By 1876 – 11 years after the end of the Civil War – all the Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union, and Reconstruction was in full swing. The Republicans were strongest in the pro-Union areas of the North and African- American regions of the South, while Democratic support coalesced around southern whites and northern areas that had been less supportive of the Civil War. That year, Republicans nominated Ohio Gov. Rutherford B. Hayes, and Democrats chose New York Gov. Samuel Tilden.

Add to that racial turmoil in our cities, the unsteady economy and climate change that has fueled widespread wildfires and other natural disasters.

My thought was that I will get excited when I’m actually on set. Until then, I stayed very low-key because we’re still living on a ticking time bomb and anything can happen.”

She said: "Brynmawr Rotary has been going since 1968 and supporting charitable causes both in Brynmawr and abroad, but I'm particularly proud of the work we have done during this period.
 "Our motto here is service above self, and we always strive to do that in everything we do, be it through donations or any other work, but Covid really has shown the importance of supporting our community at this time.
 "One of our initiatives during lockdown was to create a supplementary food bank known as the ‘Together We Are Stronger Project’ which was really busy throughout lockdown.
 "The project is spearheaded by a number of Rotarians who have teamed up with Tesco and other local businesses to provide food, toiletries and good will gestures to lift people during this time.      "Other groups including Abertillery and Blaina Rotary in Blaenau Gwent, have also come on board and assisted with donations of sanitary products to local people, and it was decided that we would continue with the project after the pandemic."
 Brynmawr Rotary was nominated by Anne Baker as one of our Covid Heroes this year.

As I stated during our phone conversation, we are also always in need of additional personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N-95 masks and gloves which can be hard to secure. We are also interested in learning more about whether FEMA will be able to reimburse for vaccine supplies that are not provided by the CDC. And finally, I am hopeful that we can re-connect in a couple of weeks to touch base as the pandemic response continues. Thank you for your consideration.
