Bills: visit the New England Patriots for a Monday night game on Dec. 28.


--DocBreak--
Nothing felt right in TD Garden on Friday night.
 The empty seats were hidden by curtains bearing the Celtics logo. The Boston Bruins hockey boards were up to act as a barrier between the media section and the players. When the game was about to begin, the player introductions were made with very little fanfare.
 And once the game tipped off, it was pretty clear the Boston Celtics probably didn’t want to be there.
 For the second straight preseason game, the Celtics looked mostly lethargic. They quickly fell behind the Brooklyn Nets and, save for an early third quarter run, rarely showed any fight.
 “We got outplayed,” Brad Stevens said after the 113-89 loss. “We can talk about techniques and coverages and all that other stuff, but it doesn’t really matter. I thought that they played with great poise and purpose and did a great job, they outplayed us in every which way.”
 Preseason games aren’t about wins and losses. They’re not even necessarily about the ball going through the hoop or stopping the other team. It’s mostly about showing progress and effort. Boston did neither.
 “I think we’ve got a lot of room for improvement,” Jaylen Brown said. “We got some young guys we’ve got to bring up to speed, and also just build some chemistry, and it’s on all of us. Definitely doing a better job of communicating on defense, but I feel like as the season goes along we’re going to grow and improve in the right direction.”
 The effort issues are magnified by the short turnaround from a disappointing end to the Eastern Conference Finals. Fans want linear improvement, and see this team as a contender who should be roaring into this season with chips on their collective shoulders after that Miami series. Seeing them look sluggish is, to put it mildly, off-putting to many who were hoping to see more urgency from this team right away.
 Still, despite this game being played on Dec. 18, this was a preseason game. It didn’t count for anything besides some indigestion.
 “We haven’t played well in the majority of these two games,” Stevens said. “And certainly our first group has not played well, or just generally the guys that are going to play the share of the minutes, so we’re going to have to make sure we get a lot better and get ready for Wednesday. We’ve got a really good team, Milwaukee, coming in. At the same time, these games are exhibition games for a reason, so we’ll learn from them and move on.”
 The short turnaround from that Miami series, coupled with injuries to a few important players, has contributed to this mess, but the team is not leaning on that crutch for excuses.
 “Just part of it. But it’s not like we’re the only team that’s going through it. Everybody is,” Jayson Tatum said. “We acquired them guys, and we don’t have that much time. We’ve got to figure it out. Everybody’s a professional, high IQ. So we’re going to figure it out, the chemistry part, but yeah, I mean, we’ve got to figure it out.”
 Stevens also added that the effort, while absent throughout most of these two games, has been there in practice.
 “We’ve practiced really hard,” Stevens said. “I thought that these guys played, again, with better purpose than us tonight. It hasn’t been something that I’d say is a concern based on what I’ve seen in camp.”
 The on-court product has not been good, but expecting it to be good given the circumstances might have been asking too much. That’s the issue with this short turnaround; the games matter very soon, but progress can only go so quickly with injuries, rookies to integrate, and new veterans building chemistry with their teammates. The Celtics have less than a week before the wins and losses start to count, and there is zero chance they’ll be ready for it.
 That’s why the effort is important. Even if they’re not fully cohesive, they can at least work hard while they’re figuring it out.
 “We’re not even close to that group that was in the bubble,” Stevens said. “We’ve got a lot of work to do to get to that point, we have to play a lot better than we have. Ultimately we have to make sure we’re building the right habits.”

West Virginia University’s football team had to cancel its regular-season showdown with Oklahoma not just once but twice. The original Nov. 28 meeting with Sooners was postponed until Dec. 12 because of a COVID-19 outbreak within the OU program, and the rescheduled game on Dec. 12 was also scrapped because WVU’s program experienced virus issues of its own and had to pause all football operations.
 That doesn’t mean the Mountaineers’ 2020 season is over, though.
 As of Friday night, West Virginia’s testing results appeared to have enough players in the clear to participate in a bowl game. It’s expected to learn the details of when, where and against whom on Sunday.
 Unfortunately the coronavirus isn’t going away anytime soon, so this bowl experience doesn’t figure to be like those of the past.
 “It’s probably going to lean a little more toward a normal road game, considering you are trying to keep the young men and the staff in the bubble,” explained WVU Director of Athletics Shane Lyons. “The bowl will do some things that will give a little flair to experience, but it’s not going to have all the entertainment factors we’re used to.”
 West Virginia’s bowl destination is not locked in yet, but it could be the Dec. 26 Guaranteed Rate Bowl in Phoenix or the Dec. 31 Liberty Bowl in Memphis.
 “Depending on where we go, some states will allow a limited number of fans,” noted Lyons. “If it’s Phoenix, Arizona is not allowing fans. It’s going to depend on the site, but it’s not going to be a normal bowl game where you go out there for three or four nights and have a lot of functions, some with the other team.”
 As the Mountaineers have seen, no game this year is a sure thing. The rug can be pulled out in a moment’s notice. In the midst of all the turmoil this fall, though, losing just one game was not shocking, Lyons said.
 "I'm very happy that we completed nine games," Lyons said during an interview on WVUSports.com. "If someone had told me in September that we would have completed nine games, I would have taken it in a heartbeat."

As chairman of the NCAA’s Division I Oversight Committee, Lyons has played a major role in how college football has operated during the pandemic. That group faced a myriad of hurdles as it navigated uncharted territory.
 “We didn’t have a crystal ball as an Oversight Committee,” said Lyons. “We knew there were going to be challenges and postponements and cancellations.
 “As a whole, we completed roughly 82 or 83% of the games in college football. Again, as I look back to August in chairing that committee, if you had said we would complete 80 to 85% of the games, I would have said, ‘Count me in.’
 “How many we did get to play is what I think is important. Originally the talk was about the number of games being canceled, but I talked to some national media people, and I said, ‘Why don’t you flip that? Look at how many games are being played.’”
 West Virginia fell one game short of the Big 12’s 10-game regular-season limit.
 “If we hadn’t lost the Nov. 28 game, and it was Oklahoma’s situation at that time, we would have gotten all 10 games in,” said Lyons. “It worried me the day I got the phone call that [the Sooners] weren’t traveling. I knew there were a couple of weeks between games that could get us.”
 Lyons’ intuition was correct. By the time the Dec. 12 date for the postponed OU game neared, WVU had 35-40 football players who had either tested positive for COVID or had been ruled out because of contact tracing, according to Lyons.
 “We traveled to Iowa State — not our best performance by any means — and we came back and we had a young man on that trip who the next day tested positive,” he noted. “Then the day after that it was another couple of athletes, and on Tuesday it was a couple more, and on Thursday it was three or four more. In addition there were a large number who were contact traced. Based on my discussions with other athletic directors across the country, when they had to shut down, sometimes they waited too long. It was a matter of do I shut this down now or do we try to get to Oklahoma, and now we may have a serious, serious problem.
 “It was a tough call, but I had to make the call along with Coach [Neal] Brown. We made the call with the thought we could preserve our opportunity to go to a bowl game. We could have taken the risk to try to continue to play, but we may have had lot of young men get the virus.”

Oregon State finished with 20 turnovers that led to 31 WSU points and also gave up 17 offensive rebounds leading to 15 second-chance points.
 “The offensive rebounds were the difference in this game, in my opinion, down the stretch,” Rueck said. “That was it. I felt like we made them miss their initial shot enough to win, but we gave him second chances and those are, just like in boxing, it's like a body blow. Just like a body blow, body blow. And typically all percentages will go up if you get a second or third chance.”

When I did work for my doctoral dissertation at the Wharton School of business for the department of Strategic Planning; a dissertation on of the teaching business ethics in business schools, I slowly realized that when companies were talking about business ethics or business social responsibilities, they were all doing so from the prism of socialist values. Importantly, only an infinite minority where talking about abortion as an ethical matter and if they did, they were all for it. Since then, the majority of large corporations is decidedly for in support of abortion. Also, under my radar, I followed the Levi-Strauss company organizing pro homosexual training seminars and offered them to all of Fortune 500 companies. I learned to be very mistrustful of large companies when they speak of ethics.

DENVER (AP) — The Buffalo Bills captured their first AFC East title in a quarter-century Saturday when 24-year-old quarterback Josh Allen threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more in a 48-19 rout of the Denver Broncos. The Bills (11-3) scored twice in a 17-second span in the third quarter to ice their fourth straight victory that officially ended the New England Patriots’ 11-year reign atop the division. The Broncos (5-9) have their fourth consecutive losing season for the first time since they had 10 straight sub-.500 campaigns from 1963-72. They also became the first team ever to go five years without making the playoffs following a Super Bowl title. Allen threw for 359 yards, hitting Stefon Diggs 11 times for 147 yards before a foot injury in the fourth quarter, and Cole Beasley eight times for 112 yards. Allen also tied Jack Kemp’s record of 25 career touchdown runs with his second TD scamper, a 1-yard keeper to the right that was set up by Andre Roberts’ 55-yard return of Taylor Russilino's short second-half kickoff. The Broncos turned to Russolino, whose vagabond career included stops in the XFL, the Canadian Football League and even the Chinese arena league after Brandon McManus went on the COVID-19 reserve list. Russolino missed a 51-yard field goal and two extra points on a windy day that didn't adversely affect Bills kicker Tyler Bass, who made both field goal attempts and all six extra points. After Allen's 1-yard TD run to start the second half, cornerback Tre’Davious White strip-sacked Drew Lock on Denver's first offensive play. Defensive end Jerry Hughes scooped up the ball at the 21 and weaved his way through several Broncos to make it 35-13.

"The way I look at it is, I completely agree with inclusivity, but at the same time it's like - these people are just as talented as any other wrestler on the show. At the end of the day it's not necessarily inclusivity. We're just as talented, it's not like we should be included - like [having one] women's match - just to fill a quota. That was one of the big problems that I had, even with postering. You see a poster and… there's maybe one or two people representing - you know, that's not white or whatever. The point I'm trying to make is that it should be based off of talent, regardless. Inclusivity, that's dope. But at the end of the day it doesn't matter. Gay, straight, it doesn't matter. Girl or guy, black or white, if you're talented you're on the show. That's how it should work."

As is wont in romantic comedies, there are missteps and miscue and signs that turn out to be portents of an entirely different nature. Blunt is endearing in her pure anti-romanticism. The primal urges sprung from hormones and the pull of being part of the tapestry of local life are compelling, making Anthony’s equivocation palpably frustrating to the point of madness. There is something in the clear-eyed way she takes Anthony’s measure that combines longing and frustration that is a marvel of complexity and emotional immediacy. The arrival of Adam in a flashy car becomes an opportunity for Shanley to wax grandiloquent on the differing sensibilities of the rural Irish and the cosmopolitan New Yorker, with the latter coming off the loser, of course. Further of course, he finds himself charmed by this forthright, no-nonsense woman who fails to acknowledge his attraction. She has eyes only for the skiddish Anthony, even when she finds him waving a paddle in mid-air and muttering to himself while floating in the middle of a pond, or when the latest rumor has him proposing to a mule.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months as I continued pondering my future.  Meanwhile, Yellow Boy and All-Fam Team member Snow opened corner stores, and Red Man, a fellow team member, opened a sports bar in Gulfport, Mississippi. I felt like a failure. I was finally getting money, but I felt smothered, trapped, and useless. I was going to die in the streets, and this mental discomfort boiled my spirits like I was constantly stepping into a tub of scalding hot bath water. I began having nightmares of being murdered or going to prison. I was so torn on the inside that I wouldn't sleep for days. Even those closest to me started having nightmares about me. My grandmother told me that she had a nightmare that I was in prison.  A woman that I was romantically involved with at the time once called me while I was out of town doing business to tell me that she had a nightmare that someone had murdered me.
