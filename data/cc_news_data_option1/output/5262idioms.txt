SILVER SPRING, Md. - A closely-watched gauge of U.S. consumer confidence tumbled in December as rising coronavirus cases dragged American optimism to its lowest level since the summer.
 However, rising pessimism is now spreading during the crucial holiday season, which could make or break a number of retailers, airlines, restaurants other sector that have been hammered financially during the pandemic.
 The December reading of 88.6 released Tuesday by the Conference Board is a sharp decline from last month, which was revised downward to 92.9, and it is far worse than economists had expected.
 It may be an ominous sign for an economy in which consumer spending accounts for 70% of all economic economic activity.
 The Commerce Department reported last week that U.S. retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in November, the biggest drop in seven months, and also worse than most were expecting. The drumbeat of weak economic data may be providing a grim preview of Christmas receipts, which can account for a quarter or more of a retailer’s annual sales.
 The index measuring consumers’ assessment of current business and labour market conditions also fell sharply, from 105.9 last month to 90.3 in December. Consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labour market conditions ticked up slightly from 84.3 in November to 87.5 this month, possibly because of recent approvals for COVID-19 vaccines.
 It remains to be seen how Congress' $900 billion relief bill, which was passed Monday and too late for the survey, will affect consumer behaviour this winter.
 The bill combines coronavirus-fighting funds with financial relief for individuals and businesses. It would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theatres and money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction.

The tour was four events into the season in the middle of February when tournaments in Thailand, Singapore and China were canceled. A week before the tour was to begin the domestic portion of its schedule, the pandemic shut down sports. Women’s golf did not return until the first weekend in August, a new event with a $1 million purse, the smallest of the year.
 They lost 18 tournaments. They added two. They played four of their five majors.
 And they finished.
 The most amazing part of the season was a Symetra Tour player named Sophia Popov, saddled by injuries that nearly made her quit playing. She got into a tournament in Ohio, played well enough to earn a spot in the Women’s British Open and then won at Royal Troon.

Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways, or bronchial tubes, that allows air to come in and out of the lungs. The narrowing and swelling of the airways, and excessive production mucus makes it hard to breathe and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when breathing out and shortness of breath.
 Eosinophilic asthma (EA) is a type of asthma that is characterised by high levels of white blood cells, called eosinophils. These cells are a natural part of the body’s immune system and they fight infections and attack invading bacteria. However, in people with eosinophilic asthma, these cells cause inflammation and swelling in the airways and respiratory system. The severity of the asthma symptoms depends on the levels of eosinophils in the blood.
 However, cases of eosinophilic asthma are rare. It is estimated that about 5 percent of all adults with asthma have EA.
 Symptoms of EA are similar to the typical asthma symptoms, but there are a few symptoms that are more likely to occur in EA patients. These include -

“We’ve had several challenges to try to get off the ground this year — whether it was Schreiber’s arena not being available, Nipigon arena not being available to have the dressing rooms for our teams,” Gribben added. “Everyone’s playing out of the Tournament Centre because they are a little bit more flexible regarding the dressing room situation.”
 The third-year president also had to grapple with the ongoing pandemic.
 “At the onset of this season we looked at what our options were to keep going,” said Gribben. “We were waiting on the 14-day quarantine period between changing cohorts. Once that happened we were able to action a season and it’s based on 14 days of playing, two teams competing against one another with a 14-day break after that.”
 The newest 14-day Northern Ontario lockdown comes an opportune time with the league essentially shutting down for the Christmas break anyway. There is no schedule yet for January.
 “Getting all four teams going was the priority,” said Gribben. “Luckily enough, Malcolm worked alongside Irwin Nichol, a long-time Nipigon force, and got it off the ground. Hopefully that’s a good sign for us to develop into the new year. Through this whole process our ownership groups have told us that the ‘want to play’ is based on what their players are telling them. These young guys are looking for something to do to remain active and to have these experiences in any form we can give them.”
 The LJHL hopes to complete a 20- to 24-game season with a best-of-three playoff series to crown a champion.
 To date, the Northern Hawks are once again dominant, winning all four games against the Thunder Bay Bandits. The Schreiber Filane’s Falcons swept Nipigon over the weekend for their first-ever 2-0-0 start.
 “It is definitely challenging. Obviously it changes the normal way of doing things,” said Schreiber coach Mario Filane-Figliomeni.
 “I’m really proud of the boys, too. They been committed for two, three months. They’ve come to practice, they haven’t missed,” he said. “They’ve been willing to be on board with whatever we have to do to follow the rules. I’m proud of the league for the effort they’ve put forward, but also really proud of the group for whatever hockey we can get this year.”
