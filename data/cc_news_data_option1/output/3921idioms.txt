Williams, 67, was accused of conspiring with others to cover up the source of cash for boozy meals, premium cigars, golf and lodging in Palm Springs, California.
 The union’s Region 5 leadership, which was based in Missouri and headed by Jones, would hold weeklong retreats in Palm Springs and invite Williams along. He said he stayed beyond “what my union business required.”
 Williams told a judge that he wondered if money was being misused but that he was assured by Jones that “everything was above board.”
 “I made the deliberate and conscious decision not to press the matter. ... I could have investigated the source of these funds or directed my staff to do so,” Williams said. “It was my duty as a UAW officer to do so. But I deliberately looked away.”

LUFKIN, Texas (KTRE) - The Trauma Service Area located in Deep East Texas has risen above the 15-percent mark of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the third-straight day.Gov. Greg Abbott announced on Sept. 17 that counties could reopen businesses to 75 percent capacity and allow resumption of elective surgeries in certain counties. However, counties in Trauma Service Areas with over 15 percent COVID-19 hospitalizations for seven consecutive days would be excluded from that reopening.Tuesday’s report states the TSA has a 16.4 percent rate of hospitalizations with COVID-19 cases. This follows rates of 16.6 percent on Monday and 16.3 percent on Sunday. This would mean if the rate stays above 15 percent for four more days, counties in that TSA would have to roll back to 50 percent capacity in businesses.Counties in the Deep East Texas TSA include Angelina, Nacogdoches, Polk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto and Tyler.The TSA last exceeded the threshold on Sept. 21 and again on Sept. 24 but dipped below the threshold the next day each time.Copyright 2020 KTRE.

People joke, at the same time, about men who “get lost in the sauce” of sex and beauty, yet they can marry and confer citizenship.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held an “extensive conversation” Wednesday on a huge COVID-19 rescue package, meeting face to face for the first time in more than a month in a last-ditch effort to seal a tentative accord on an additional round of coronavirus relief.After a 90-minute meeting in the Capitol, Pelosi issued a statement saying the two would continue to talk. “We found areas where we are seeking further clarification,” she said.“We made a lot of progress over the last few days. We still don’t have an agreement,” Mnuchin said after meeting with Pelosi and briefing top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell.At the very least, the positive tone set by Pelosi and Mnuchin represented an improvement over earlier statements. But there is still a considerable gulf between the two sides, McConnell said.“I’ve seen substantial movement, yes, and certainly the rhetoric has changed,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said.Despite the optimism, the Democratic-controlled House will vote Wednesday night on a partisan $2.2 trillion virus relief bill that is strongly opposed by Republicans.At issue is a long-delayed package that would extend another round of $1,200 direct stimulus payments, restore bonus pandemic jobless benefits, speed aid to schools and extend assistance to airlines, restaurants and other struggling businesses. A landmark $2 trillion relief bill in March passed with sweeping support and is credited with helping the economy through the spring and summer, but worries are mounting that the recovery may sputter without additional relief.Mnuchin said Wednesday morning that he would tender a new offer resembling a plan released a couple of weeks ago by the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. That proposal was previously rejected by Pelosi and other top Democrats as inadequate. It totals about $1.5 trillion and would provide additional jobless benefits if unemployment remains unacceptably high.Pelosi and Mnuchin have ramped up talks in recent days but remain far apart. The two have worked effectively together in the past and were key forces on the “CARES Act” in March, but the bipartisan spirit that drove that measure into law has all but evaporated. Neither side has publicly offered the kind of concessions that would generate tangible momentum.McConnell said the two sides remain “very, very far apart,” though he spoke before being briefed on the Mnuchin-Pelosi meeting. Aides said the two sides are not close.Even if Pelosi and Mnuchin were able to reach a tentative agreement on “top line” spending levels, dozens of nettlesome details would need to be worked out. A particularly difficult issue, Pelosi told her colleagues earlier in the day, remains McConnell’s insistence on a liability shield for businesses fearing COVID-related lawsuits after they reopen their doors.“Let’s see if we can get a compromise agreement with the Speaker, something that works, and then we’ll continue to work with both sides on all the exact language and the policies,” Mnuchin said earlier.Pelosi’s latest bill would revive a $600-per-week pandemic jobless benefit and send a second round of direct payments to most individuals. It would scale back an aid package to state and local governments to a still-huge $436 billion, send a whopping $225 billion to colleges and universities and deliver another round of subsidies to businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program. Airlines would get another $25 billion in aid to prevent a wave of layoffs that are coming this week.The proposal represents a cutback from a $3.4 billion bill that passed the House in May but remains well above what Senate Republicans are willing to accept. Republicans have endorsed staying in the $650 billion to $1 trillion range.The specific numbers are also fuzzy because both sides are using offset spending cuts or new tax revenues to pay for part of their respective bills. The Congressional Budget Office has not scored either the most recent Senate GOP measure or the Democratic plan slated for Wednesday night’s vote.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The group stated that they want more transparency and clear explanations by governments when instituting measures in any emergency situation present or future. “The burden of proof for instituting measures is on the government. People are afraid mainly as a result of confusion due to mixed messages and a lack of explanation other than the repetitive fear-based message constantly putting the blame of infection on the general public when 90% of the deaths in Quebec, as an example, occurred in long-term care facilities.”
 “We have to question why the government is not talking about the issues surrounding the real culprit causes of COVID-19 deaths, such as substandard care in long term care facilities. We cannot simply ignore facts.”
 FC members do not criticize the emergency measures taken in March, seeing as is there was no local data to rely on at the time. “We are past 6 months in, there exists data which has been investigated and assembled voluntarily by world experts who by default discovered parallel correlations in their findings.”
 “The question we are posing to the government, the media responsible for covering all angles impartially as well as ourselves is: why are these facts not being considered and brought to light?”
 “We are not vested in one government or another. We are not anti-maskers; we are 'anti-government measures' that do not coincide with science.”
 “We also want to encourage others to ask themselves the same questions and where they sense censorship, to dig deeper. Since when is the democratic process in Canada allowed to be suppressed?”

Credit the Bears back end adjusting, knowing Ryan's other receivers couldn't pick up the slack. Chicago took advantage of the Falcons missing linemen up front, battering Ryan often. Akiem Hicks generated a whopping five QB hits and 1.5 sacks. Khalil Mack was a monster off the edge, earning two QB hits, half a sack, and disrupted many more plays. The Bears gave up chunk plays early. Once they took those away, the Falcons offense was dead in the water. And Atlanta couldn't adjust."

That direction was to merge their Western coal mines under the same operation umbrella while also merging the neighboring North Antelope Rochelle, owned by Peabody, and Arch’s Black Thunder mines in southern Campbell County. It also would have included Peabody’s Rawhide and Caballo mines and Arch’s Coal Creek mine in Wyoming and two Colorado coal mines, Twentymile (Peabody) and West Elk (Arch).
 Separately, NARM and Black Thunder are the nation’s top producing coal mines.
 Together as a single operation, the companies stood to realize tens of millions of dollars a year in efficiencies, according to their joint venture proposal filed in June 2019.
 Under the terms of the joint venture, Peabody would have owned 66.5% of the new company and have operational control while Arch would have had 33.5%. It would have created an estimated $820 million in net value for the companies off the bat as well as streamlining operations to the tune of another $120 million in savings a year for a decade.
 Arch and Peabody already control more than two-thirds of the overall coal production from the Powder River Basin, according to the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. Their five PRB mines produced 182.4 million tons of coal in 2019, about 68% of the overall 293.5 million mined. NARM and Black Thunder alone produced 157.3 million tons, or nearly 59% of the basin’s output last year.
 They also employ a proportional number of people. Overall, the companies employ 2,441 people, or about 60% of the 4,090 as of June 30 reported to MSHA.
 That the companies won't appeal the ruling isn’t a surprise, Godby said.
 Historically large mergers like the one proposed in the joint venture haven’t fared well with appeals.
 “Arch and Peabody could appeal, but typically in these sorts of cases … this pretty common the companies give up on the plan,” he said.
 Although the state of Wyoming and Gov. Mark Gordon spoke out in favor of the joint venture, the court wasn’t persuaded.
 “What this leaves us now is what we started with — four large suppliers, plus some smaller ones, competing for an ever-shrinking market,” Godby said, referencing the next largest PRB producers, Eagle Specialty Materials and Navajo Transitional Energy Co. “There’s no doubt this would’ve made Arch and Peabody more competitive.”
 While the joint venture may have been the best solution for Peabody, Arch and the overall long-term future of coal production from the PRB, Tuesday’s decision also probably is being met with some relief by other basin coal companies.
 “You can’t argue against the idea that this is a bad day for Arch and Peabody and probably not a great day for the Powder River Basin,” Godby said. “It underlines how bad conditions are when you need a merger like this to help overall current conditions in the basin.”
 For other PRB coal producers, the decision “probably means they're breathing a sigh of relief they won’t have a mega-company to compete with,” he said.
 The basin’s coal industry remains in the same boat it’s been in, he said. The math says the PRB already is overdue for contraction with plummeting production and the same number of mines competing for fewer customers. This year’s production is on pace to be 203 million tons, or about 24% less than 2019 and more than 52% less than the 426 million tons mined a decade ago.
 With or without the joint venture, contraction is going to happen, Godby said. But it could make that transition much more smooth for the basin and Wyoming.
 “What we really need here to firm up the industry is take some of that excess supply off the market,” he said. “Without this merger, that’s going to happen one way or another. It becomes more likely we'll see more failures and disorderly consolidation than orderly consolidation in the Powder River Basin.”
 Other industry analysts agree.
 Ben Nelson, vice president-senior credit officer and lead coal analyst for Moody’s Investors Service, said that without the joint venture, the outlook for PRB coal continues to be bleak.
 “The U.S. District Court’s decision to uphold the FTC objection to the joint venture between Arch Resources and Peabody Energy is credit-negative for both companies,” Nelson said in a statement to the News Record. “We expect the Powder River Basin coal production region will remain under significant pressure in 2021 and at least a few coal mines in the region could close in the early 2020s.”

"If you blow a lead of 15 points for a second straight week, you get an 'F,'" Breech writes. "Those are the rules here. A big reason this loss happened is because the Falcons offense absolutely disappeared in the fourth quarter. Matt Ryan didn't complete his first pass of the quarter until there was under two minutes left, and shortly after he did that, he threw a pick that sealed the win for Chicago. If we learned one thing about the Falcons in this game, it's that no lead is ever safe in Atlanta, no matter how big."

We tested 60 people that day, and there was only one positive case, an older man who called himself Z. He had no symptoms aside from feeling a bit under the weather. The diagnosis hit him hard, and he began talking about connecting with his estranged son to discuss his last rites. He was an American, and didn’t want to follow protocol and isolate himself in a Covid hotel because he was afraid he would be taking advantage of our universal health care. I convinced him that isolating himself would help out the community and flatten the curve. I waited with him as the city coordinated transportation from the shelter to a hotel, which took a total of five hours. We had a long conversation about Bacteriophage Lambda, a group of viruses that multiply inside bacterial cells and have had a huge impact on the course of evolution. I was embarrassed it was taking so long for a van to arrive, but Z was in no rush. “When you're living on the street you do a lot of waiting.” After he finally left, one of the staff at the shelter approached me. “I have a medical condition, I’m immunocompromised and I just spent six hours with him," he asked. "What is my risk?” He'd been wearing a mask and practising physical distancing, so I asked him to self-monitor carefully.

 Some debt collectors prey on a person's emotions and lack of confidence. If you don't know your rights, they can scare you by using bogus threats. Understand what I'm saying here, Paul. If you have debt, you have a legal and moral obligation to pay it. At the same time, you need to calmly and confidently control these kinds of conversations. You might have made some financial mistakes, but that doesn't mean you should allow someone to abuse you.
 When it comes to dealing with debt collectors, keep track of all the calls and emails. Write down the names of anyone you talk to and when they called. A record of all contact is important, and it will make it easier to report them if they violate the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If the collector agrees to settle the debt, get it in writing and keep the document as proof in case they "forget" they made the offer.
 Also, be completely up to speed on your accounts. Know what you owe, who you owe, and have a record of all the payments you've made. Knowing the facts gives you the upper hand in any situation. Don't be intimidated by debt collectors, either. Calmly explain your situation, the reason you're behind on the debt, and how you plan to pay it off. Don't get emotional and let yourself get drawn into an argument or shouting match. If they insult you, or yell or curse at you - yes, this happens sometimes - hang up immediately.
 Financial troubles like debt can make every aspect of your life feel messed up. If you want to get back on track, start living on a written, monthly budget, and attack your debts using the debt snowball system. It's not easy, and it takes discipline, hard work, and sacrifices, but it's worth it!

Arch operates the Black Thunder and Coal Creek mines in Campbell County, which together employ nearly 1,140 people and produced 74.5 million tons of coal in 2019, 72 million from Black Thunder alone.
 That Arch would react to the court’s decision to uphold the FTC objection to the joint venture isn’t a surprise, said Rob Rob Godby, Director of the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at the University of Wyoming College of Business.
 “Arch has been pretty clear for while now thermal coal is not in their future,” he said. “They even took ‘coal’ out of their name.
 “It was clear from the get-go that Arch wanted out of the basin, which is why Peabody would’ve been running the joint venture. It’s been pretty obvious Arch has wanted out of thermal coal.”
 In May, Arch changed its name from Arch Coal Inc. to Arch Resources.
 The companies could have appealed the decision and continued to push for the joint venture, but that apparently won’t happen.
 “Arch strongly disagrees with the verdict and continues to believe that the joint venture would have served the best interests of all stakeholders,” Arch says in its statement. “Nonetheless, after extensive consideration and discussion, Arch and Peabody have agreed to discontinue legal efforts … ”
 For Arch, that means it will move forward with a focus on its metallurgical coal operations, said Chief Executive Officer Paul A. Lang.
 “While we are disappointed with the court’s decision, we intend to move full speed ahead with our strategic pivot toward steel and metallurgical markets,” Lang said. "In the wake of today’s decision, we will be intensifying our pursuit of strategic alternatives for our thermal assets — including, among other things, potential divestiture.”
 Arch has been a major player in PRB coal since it bought its Wyoming mines from Atlantic Richfield in 1998.
 Peabody Energy also is “deeply disappointed” with the ruling, said President and CEO Glenn Kellow in a press release.
 "Our focus now is on continuing to be the low-cost PRB coal provider to best compete against natural gas and subsidized renewables,” Kellow said. "We remain committed to ensuring our customers continue to have access to a reliable and affordable fuel source.”
 What the decision means is the federal court upheld the argument of the FTC that the joint venture would essentially make the Peabody/Arch partnership a monopoly that could result in higher energy prices for customers, Godby said.
 In a statement responding to the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, FTC Bureau of Competition Director Ian Conner hailed the ruling as a win that will maintain a free market for thermal coal.
 "Peabody and Arch Coal's decision to abandon their joint venture will preserve competition in the market for thermal coal, which is sold to power-generating utilities that provide electricity to millions of Americans," Conner said. "The joint venture likely would have raised the price of coal to the utilities, and ultimately to consumers."
 What the ruling means for the pair of Powder River Basin powerhouse coal producers is more business as usual, which “is not good, that’s for sure,” he said.
 “It’s not great news if you’re Arch and Peabody, that’s for sure,” he said. “It really puts a wrench in their plans because a lot of their planning was based on moving in this direction.”

One sweltering July day, a month after he’d been granted yet another court delay, I pulled up in front of the three-storey brick house, on a quiet cul- de-sac. I knocked on the door. Inside, a dog barked maniacally, but no one answered. Then the garage door lifted and an SUV backed out. Rootenberg was alone behind the wheel, white AirPods in his ears. A cool puff of air hit my face as he lowered his window. I asked if he was Shaun. He said evenly that he was, peering out at me, his eyes beady in the sun. I explained why I was there and asked if he’d care speak to me for the story I was writing about him. His demeanour turned cold and his sentences clipped. “Why would I talk to you? The press is biased,” he said. “All that ever gets printed about me is lies.” Then he rolled up the window and drove off, slipping around the corner and out of sight.

 # Blue Springs adopts 'chugging along' spending plan
 By Mike Genet mike.genet@examiner.net
 While the city of Blue Springs budget for 2020-21 approved in September is more than 11 percent less than the 2019-20 budget, no employees have been cut amid the pandemic, and there will be a 2.5 percent pay raise across the board in the spring.
 The budget unanimously approved by the City Council checks in at $69.15 million, down from last year’s budget of $78.27 million, as revenues from taxes and various fees are down in every area due to the pandemic. But the 309.5 full-time equivalent positions remain the same, thanks to some savings from less in capital expenses, City Administrator Eric Johnson said.
 “I’m so proud of our team of people here in place, in all departments, who have been asked to do things over the last six months,” Johnson said, echoing in large part what he told the council back in August when staff first presented the budget.
 “I’m most proud of the fact we’ve had no layoffs, no furloughs, and we will give an across-the-board 2.5 percent raise. There aren’t many cities right now that can say that.”
 Keeping those jobs, he said, is as important as ever right now.
 “We probably have several employees whose spouses no longer have jobs. My goal is to keep chugging along here.”
 Johnson said the city had some fortunate timing in that it had recently completed some expensive one-time projects in recent years, such as water and sewer improvements and the City Hall renovation, for which it didn’t need to budget.
 Regular planned projects such as street maintenance and parks renovations didn’t need to take any cuts, he said. Some vehicle and equipment replacements, like in public works or the police department, won’t happen at the same scale as originally planned.
 “Maybe we do one or two trucks in public works instead of four, and three police cars instead of seven,” Johnson said, giving some general examples.
 Assistant City Administrator Christine Cates said the city saved nearly $800,000 for this year by bidding out health insurance services.
 Council Member Chris Lievsay had proposed earmarking $60,000 for a household hazardous waste program for residents, to be determined in the future. One option, he said, could be to rejoin the Mid-America Regional Council program that the city opted out of last year. That proposal got voted down 4-3, as some council members preferred to get more finite cost numbers before they committed city funds.
 Council Member Kent Edmondson proposed adding $1 million to the annual pavement maintenance program, making it $3.8 million – a “one-time hit to help get it back in line,” he said. The council unanimously approved that move.

Chaki remembers his mother glued listening to the radio to learn if any of her relatives or friends from Greece remained alive. Chaki never knew his grandmothers, grandfathers, uncles, aunts, or cousins. They were all killed in Auschwitz.
 “In the early ‘60s, I never wanted to be associated with the Holocaust,” said Chaki. “I felt it was holding back my thinking. It wasn’t until I met my wife’s family in Montreal when I saw everybody together on Friday nights with relatives coming and going. Then I understood”
 It was then that Chaki started some drawings, mostly of those who died in concentration camps. These barely recognizable figures have become the basis for the exhibition. Each of these hundreds of portraits are drawn and painted with ink, acrylic, and latex paint on paper. Every drawing of the obscure faces is earmarked with numbers, signifying to the numbers the Nazis tattooed on the flesh of their captives.
 The pictures are unframed, scattered on the floor.
 “Framing means something is finished.” said Chaki. “But these are never finished. Maybe in time some of the corners will tear. They will become worn and look almost like they to came out of a concentration camp.”

"Mike Pettine has had the Green Bay Packers' coverage unit operate in a far more diverse scheme than it did in 2019," PFF's Anthony Treash writes. "They are one of five teams so far this year to not run at least 25% of their coverage snaps out of one specific coverage concept. Whether playing press-man or in a zone concept, Alexander has excelled in coverage for the Packers to the tune of top-10 coverage grades in both man and zone coverage. That combines to form an 88.6 coverage grade on the year."

NEW YORK — A wealthy benefactor of the disgraced leader of an upstate New York self-improvement group has been sentenced to more than six years in prison in connection with a federal sex slave case.
 Seagram’s liquor fortune heiress Clare Bronfman appeared in federal court Wednesday in Brooklyn, where a judge handed her an 81-month prison sentence. She was immediately taken into custody to begin her sentence.
 Bronfman's lawyers wanted her to get only three years of probation, but prosecutors said she deserves five years behind bars for her support of Keith Raniere.
 Raniere was convicted of charges last year accusing him of turning some of his followers into sex slaves branded with his initials.
 Raniere is known as the leader of the group NXIVM. Prosecutors say the organization operated like a cult, in which members formed a secret sorority comprised of brainwashed female “slaves” who were forced to have sex with Raniere.
 Long affiliated with NXIVM, Bronfman reportedly provided millions of dollars to bankroll Raniere and his program of self-improvement classes and paid for lawyers to defend the group against a lawsuit filed by critics.
 Last year, Bronfman admitted in a guilty plea that she harbored someone who was living in the U.S. illegally for “labor and services.” She also claimed to have committed credit card fraud on behalf of Raniere.
 Bronfman’s lawyers argued that she deserved leniency because she didn’t have direct involvement with the most disturbing allegations in the case, but prosecutors said she deserved severe punishment because Raniere likely couldn’t have gotten away with what he did without her.

FALCON: FAIR. Water lightly stained north and clear south; 84 degrees; 37.12' low. There is not a ton of traffic on the lake, but rain, white bass, and crappie are here to catch in bunches. Black bass are fair with submerged houses, natural formations, and brush piles. You just got to keep moving. Most catches come on the first cast, and the hotspots aren't holding more than one or two black bass. The black bass haven't made a big push shallower quite yet. Large plastic worms and plastic crawfish are great if you can find them with a few supply issues, and square billed crankbaits have been good, especially on the rocks where you will also catch some white bass. The white bass are great on the rocks on crankbait. Crappie are excellent over brush piles. Catfish are always biting, and constant cloudy water help. Remember to stay on the Texas side unless you possess a Mexican fishing license.
