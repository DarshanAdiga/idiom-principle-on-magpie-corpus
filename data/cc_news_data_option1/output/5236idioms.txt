Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.

“I thought he had great poise out there, great leadership,” Doug Pederson said of Hurts after the game. “[He] played physically tough, mentally tough, made some really good throws down the stretch, especially in the second half when we had to put a couple drives together. He played really well, took care of the football, he did those things really well and led the team into the end zone.”
 The Pederson comments are interesting, as he was much less complementary after his first NFL start, a win against the Saints last week. He still would not commit to Hurts starting going forward.   “He’s a motivated athlete, a motivated quarterback," Pederson continued. "He’s a self-starter, great leadership ability… you saw today how well he can throw from the pocket and outside the pocket. He’s doing a good job. I would say there's room to grow, just learning the details of our game, he can do better there. But he gave us an opportunity to win today.”  
 There's a saying — I am sure I heard it said with great corniness by Troy Aikman or someone else broadcasting a football game many times — that if you have two quarterbacks you have no quarterbacks. The Eagles will have a lot to figure out as they've got, at the very least, an extremely talented and high- potential hot hand in Hurts, and a former star who has been shaken to his core in Wentz.  
 Philadelphia's potential draft slot in 2021 could still potentially fall anywhere from the top 10 to the low 20s — so more than the QB controversy and their push to try and win the division, every snap has ramifications for next season. And each success on the field (win or loss) makes it less likely that regime change — for better or worse — will occur at season's end.
 Interestingly, Washington's loss to the Seahawks earlier helps keep the NFC East drama alive for the Eagles for another week, and things could get even more interesting with a Giants' loss on Sunday Night Football. The report on Wentz, paired with the high level play from Hurts assures that the Eagles will have non stop drama this entire offseason.

Stop your laughing I'm serious! Matt Moylan had a nightmare 2020, with injuries limiting him to just eight games with his longest burst of uninterrupted availability being three games on the trot. Moylan faired barely better in 2019 either injuries again limiting him to just the 11 games. So why should you take a risk on him for 2021 I hear you ask; in short because while there's plenty of risk there's reward here too. The Sharks will be without chief playmaker Shaun Johnson (Achilles injury) for the opening 8-10 rounds of the regular season and that opens the door for Moylan to take charge of the team. If, and it's an all caps IF, Moylan can find his 2016-2018 form then you're getting a player capable of averaging double his asking price and that's some reward.

Los Angeles was sixth in the league converting on third down at a 44.8% clip, but it was a woeful 2 of 11 against the Jets.


  "They did a good job defensively to prevent us getting to rhythm. In second half we bounced back but it was too little, too late," said Goff, who completed 22 of 34 passes for 209 yards with two touchdowns and a pick.


  Most of the attention will be focused on the offense, but all three phases had breakdowns.


  On special teams, Johnny Hekker had a punt blocked in the second quarter, which led to the first of Sam Ficken's three field goals and a 10-0 deficit for the Rams.


  The defense failed to generate a turnover for the first time in eight games and had a three-game streak snapped where it scored a touchdown. The Jets were second-to-last in the league on third-down conversions, but were 7 of 17 on Sunday.


  Next Sunday's NFC West showdown at Seattle was already important, but it takes on greater significance if the Rams want to claim the division. Los Angeles has to beat the Seahawks to at least gain the tiebreaker for sweeping the season series. The Rams then finish on Jan. 3 by hosting Arizona while Seattle faces San Francisco.


  "We have two division opponents coming up. We missed a chance to clinch, now it's even more important to win the next two games," safety John Johnson said. "Certain teams have that knack for winning. We're still learning that."

  # The hopes and fears of all the years


  Rev. David Wilson Rogers


  View Comments


  The desolation of warfare and its bitter divisions loomed large in the recent memory of Philips Brooks. As the pastor of a large urban Congregation, he had prayerfully led his parishioners through several years of bitter fears and deadly ambitions as the embattled armies of the North and South pitted brother against brother. Hopeful in the days following the war’s end, he again found himself reeling in the frightening reality that the nation’s beloved leader lay dead from an assassin's bullet.


  In the months that followed the end of America’s Civil War and the death of President Abraham Lincoln, Brooks left for a spiritual journey and faithful retreat to the dark streets of a tiny village half way across the globe. Then, on Christmas Eve, he found himself riding quietly into her dark streets as he prayerfully remembered the Everlasting Light that first shined there.


  Brooks struggled to come to terms with the violent and bloody world from which he came and was prayerfully anxious about returning to the United States and his Philadelphia church. The end of military conflict, he clearly understood, would not end the bitter divisions, or heal the deep wounds, that existed in the great conflagration between North and South.


  He also recognized, with great distain, that as passionately as he preached for an end to slavery and unification of the nation in the name of God, those whom he opposed also used their pulpits to evoke God’s name in their faithful opposition. So many hopes! So many fears! As he walked the silent streets of that ancient village, he realized that hopes and fears of all the years—the whole scope of human history—converged there in a stable where a young virgin gave birth to the savior of the world. Moved by his experience in the little town of Bethlehem, Brooks penned the words that would later become a great Christmas Carol.


  Brooks saw in Jesus Christ a reality that Christians often tragically overlook. Throughout human history, there have been realities and situations that have caused us unrelenting pain and fear, as well as motivating unquenched hope and joy. Yet frequently, these hopes and fears clash. One group of believers faithfully hold fast to the Biblical acceptance of slavery as a part of God’s plan as outlined in scripture and another faithfully hold fast to the Biblical calls for freedom and equality as God’s plan as outlined in scripture. With economic, political, and cultural priorities at stake, the two sides hung their most profound hopes and greatest fears on their ability to make their dreams come true, as well as defend against the fears that the other side may seek to do.


  As the hopes and fears of so many years are met in Christ, something miraculous happens. The deadly chain of human sin and hatred is broken. Even in the midst of genuine (and often very significant) differences over how imperfect humans seek to faithfully understand and live by God’s word, a wondrous gift is given as God imparts to human hearts the joys of highest heaven.


  Some eighteen centuries after the miracle of God’s Salvation first graced those sacred streets, Brooks found the power and promise still radiating with reassuring brilliance that is the ultimate blessing of the whole Christmas story—God is with us! Recalling the angelic pronouncement made so many years before, Brooks wrote for his time and day a reminder and heartfelt prayer to Christ for today. “O come to us, abide with us, our God, Emmanuel.”


  The beloved Carol “O Little Town of Bethlehem” calls us to live the promise of God in Jesus Christ at Christmas as we let our differences melt away in the joy of God With Us!

INGLEWOOD, Calif.


  The Los Angeles Rams were poised to celebrate wrapping up a playoff spot with a win on Sunday. Instead, they have to grapple with letting a golden opportunity slip away after handing the New York Jets their first victory.


  The Rams' 23-20 loss makes them the fifth team since 1978 to go down to defeat when favored by at least 17 points. Not only did Los Angeles (9-5) fail to wrap up its fourth postseason berth in five years, but it fell out of the NFC West lead.


  "We're all sick to our stomachs. Everyone is upset," defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day said.


  The obvious question after the game was if they overlooked a winless team? Los Angeles came in rested after a 24-3 win over New England on Dec. 10, but it looked dazed for most of the game.


  "That question is always going to be up in the air. With the room we have I don't think that's the case," offensive tackle Rob Havenstein said. "Obviously it didn't translate to a winning game."

  “We had a little bit of a layoff and weren’t sharp. The penalties were really hurtful,” coach Sean McVay said.

CINCINNATI (FOX19) - For the first time in a long time, a rescued horse named “Dan” is getting the love and attention rescuers say he deserves.The 38-year-old horse showed up at an auction, Kim Kinder with Fighting Chance Rescue says, and they ended up buying him from his owner for $300.“Just devastated that another human can do this to an animal, so emotionally wise, we just, ya know, we cry. We’re upset. We try to love the horse back to health as best as we can,” said Kinder. Right away, they could tell his health was declining fast. After examining him, Kinder says they discovered a list of health problems.Not only is he severely underweight, Kinder said he has a disease in his teeth, which she says is so bad, he will have to have all of them removed.“Someone purposely did this and they profited off of their abuse,” said Kinder.Dan got worse before he got better, according to rescuers. Kinder and her husband Joe, who is a former EMT, say they slept in the barn for several days to monitor Dan overnight.His organs were initially shutting down, but Dan’s rescuers say they are now starting to function better.“His health was declining little by little, and then he collapsed,” Kinder said, “It’s always a shock, no matter how many times you go through this.”One week into his care, rescuers say they are seeing improvements. They believe without a doubt that his condition was caused by neglect.“Body score is from one to 10, and he was a one, which is the closest to death and still be breathing,” said Kinder. So far this year, they’ve taken in 60 horses, and Kinder said six of them died.Dan’s rescuers say they are doing everything they can to make sure he is not number seven.“Most of the horses that we lost were due to organ damage, and the horse could not overcome the starvation,” said Kinder. “He is gaining weight. He is improving, but he has a long way to go.”Kinder said there is no excuse for what happened to Dan because there are always resources available and rescues willing to help. The rescue is accepting donations, especially now, to help them cover the cost of Dan’s care. Anyone who would like to donate can do so through the rescue’s website or Facebook page.

  The offense got off to another slow start by coming up empty on the first six drives, including a blocked punt and interception. Jared Goff was 11 of 20 for 86 yards with an interception in the first half before throwing two touchdowns in the second half.

One of those was an 18-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter that would have tied the game at 23 pending the extra point. Instead, it was nullified due to a holding penalty on Austin Corbett.

“(The project) totally saved the day in these COVID times,” Orr said. “We projected a 25% revenue decrease when we did our budget. We are (now) sitting at an over 20% increase year to date. In September alone, we had an 82% increase in sales and use tax revenue from September of 2019.”
 Orr noted the city of Cheyenne has recently signed a 30-year lease with NextEra Energy to lead the project on the Belvoir Ranch west of Cheyenne. Any change to the state’s tax policies, Orr argued, would be changing the game for companies committed to working in the state.
 “We’re going to change the pieces on the game that we’re playing with them – how fair is that? And what does that signal to other businesses that are looking at coming in?” Orr asked the committee.
 Several others, representing both wind-energy companies and local governments, spoke against the tax increase, which was also opposed by the Wyoming Business Alliance. Tom Darin, director of western affairs for the American Wind Energy Association, told the committee that Wyoming already has a high tax rate on wind energy compared to other states in the region.
 “Increasing our taxes with these low regional prices, where the market – not legislators – pick winners and losers, may well be at a tipping point with a winning project,” Darin said. “Most importantly, the revenue and the jobs go to a neighboring state, not staying here in Wyoming. This is truly a case where a higher tax rate might seem attractive at first blush, but please listen to me and to the developers and others that will follow me today.”
 Others argued the wind energy industry has been crucial for the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. Troy Udell, a Riverton resident who has worked on the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project near Rawlins, said the repercussions of raising the tax would be severe for those who found work on wind farms.

Los Angeles was sixth in the league converting on third down at a 44.8% clip, but it was a woeful 2 of 11 against the Jets.
 "They did a good job defensively to prevent us getting to rhythm. In second half we bounced back but it was too little, too late," said Goff, who completed 22 of 34 passes for 209 yards with two touchdowns and a pick.
 Most of the attention will be focused on the offense, but all three phases had breakdowns.
 On special teams, Johnny Hekker had a punt blocked in the second quarter, which led to the first of Sam Ficken's three field goals and a 10-0 deficit for the Rams.
 The defense failed to generate a turnover for the first time in eight games and had a three-game streak snapped where it scored a touchdown. The Jets were second-to-last in the league on third-down conversions, but were 7 of 17 on Sunday.
 Next Sunday's NFC West showdown at Seattle was already important, but it takes on greater significance if the Rams want to claim the division. Los Angeles has to beat the Seahawks to at least gain the tiebreaker for sweeping the season series. The Rams then finish on Jan. 3 by hosting Arizona while Seattle faces San Francisco.
 "We have two division opponents coming up. We missed a chance to clinch, now it's even more important to win the next two games," safety John Johnson said. "Certain teams have that knack for winning. We're still learning that."

The expert panel’s recommendation next goes to the CDC director and to states as guidance to put together vaccination programs. CDC directors have almost always signed off on committee recommendations. No matter what the CDC says, there will be differences from state to state, because various health departments have different ideas about who should be closer to the front of the line.


  Federal officials expect that vaccine doses will be limited for several months. CDC officials say up to 20 million are projected to start getting shots this month, another 30 million next month, and 50 million in February. That’s 100 million out of a population of more than 330 million.


  Pfizer’s shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used the next day, kicking off the nation’s biggest vaccination drive.


  Public health experts say the shots — and others in the pipeline — are the only way to stop a virus that has been spreading wildly. Nationwide, more than 219,000 people per day on average test positive for the virus, which has killed over 316,000 in the U.S. and nearly 1.7 million worldwide.

South Carolina interim football coach Mike Bobo wasn't going to spill all the tea about the Gamecocks' uncertain roster situation heading into the Gasparilla Bowl.
 There might be new opt-outs or absences, he admitted, but anything that's not public won't be shared until the day before Saturday's game. South Carolina had 51 or 52 scholarship players Sunday at the first official practice of bowl week, Bobo said. There are three known key absences because of players preparing for the NFL Draft -- and some questions about filling those spots.
 After the season, wide receiver Shi Smith, offensive lineman Sadarius Hutchinson and linebacker Ernest Jones all declared For the draft and didn't return to the team. The plan to replace Jones was on display in the season finale, and it involved throwing every remaining body on the field (there aren't many). Things are a little trickier with Smith.
 "Guys like Dakereon (Joyner) are going to have to step up," Bobo said. "Trey Adkins in the slot. We might move Josh Vann in the slot and Ger-Cari Caldwell stepping up outside.

In that one, JMU played the Pirates of the American Athletic Conference to a tie during the 35 minutes preseason CAA Player of the Year Matt Lewis was on the floor. But it was during the short stretches Lewis, who finished with a game-high 19 points, went to the bench for a rest that ECU (6-1) was able to build a cushion and hold on for the victory.
 Lewis’ value to JMU (3-2) was just as evident again on Sunday with the senior from Woodbridge scoring 20 points in the first half before finishing with 29 to go along with three assists and three steals. With conference play looming once the calendar flips to 2021, the Dukes now need to figure out who else can rise to the occasion.
 “We’ve got a lot of guys,” Lewis said. “Terrence Edwards played a really good game today. He’s a guy who can step up once he starts to feel the game out and gets some more minutes. He’s just a freshman so I think he’s a guy who is going to be really good for us.”
 Edwards finished with nine points, six rebounds and eight assists without a turnover.

Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema kept up his impressive run of form by scoring and providing two assists in a 3-1 win away to Eibar on Sunday, taking the champions level on points with La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid. The French forward got Real off to a flying start by scoring in the sixth minute, trapping a chipped pass from Rodrygo with his right foot and calmly finishing into the net with his left for a fifth goal in his last four matches in all competitions.He was the architect of Madrid's second goal in the 13th, beating a defender by the byline and cutting the ball back to the edge of the area, where Luka Modric was waiting to slam it high into the net with one touch. Eibar got back into contention with a curling long-range strike from Kike Garcia in the 28th minute. However, Zinedine Zidane's side sealed the points with a Lucas Vazquez goal in stoppage time, created by another fine pass from Benzema, to make it five wins in a row in all competitions.The win means second-placed Real Madrid join leaders Atletico Madrid on 29 points, although Atletico have two games in hand.Madrid were lacking a bit of firepower in attack due to the absence of Eden Hazard and Vinicius Jr, but once again Benzema was happy to do most of the heavy lifting in attack.The man who Zidane described last week as the best French forward of all time combined superbly with Rodrygo for the opening goal, timing his run to perfection to beat the offside trap before producing an exquisite control and finish.Benzema showed his more generous side to set up Modric for the second goal and should have scored again moments later when he failed to properly connect with a Modric cross.He looked to have found his second goal after Garcia's sumptuous curler but his strike was ruled out for offside.Eibar improved greatly after the interval and spurned a number of chances to equalise.Japanese midfielder Takashi Inui latched on to a disastrous pass from Real captain Sergio Ramos but failed to find the target, while his compatriot Yoshinori Muto struck the woodwork soon after.Eibar then had loud appeals for a penalty turned down when the ball struck the arm of Ramos.But just as in Madrid's last victory over Athletic Bilbao, they rode out late pressure and scored right at the end of the game to leave with a 3-1 scoreline that again masked some obvious defensive frailties.

The $300 per week bonus jobless benefit was one half the supplemental federal unemployment benefit provided under the $1.8 billion CARES Act in March and would be limited to 11 weeks instead of 16 weeks. The direct $600 stimulus payment to most people would also be half the March payment, subject to the same income limits in which an individual's payment began to phase out after $75,000.


  The CARES Act was credited with keeping the economy from falling off a cliff amid widespread lockdowns this spring, but Republicans controlling the Senate cited debt concerns in pushing against Democratic demands. Republican politicians, starting with President Donald Trump, focused more on reopening the economy and less on taxpayer-financed steps like supplemental jobless benefits.


  Progress came after a bipartisan group of pragmatists and moderates devised a $908 billion plan that built a middle ground position that the top four leaders of Congress -- the GOP and Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate -- used as the basis for their talks. The lawmakers urged leaders on both sides to back off of hard-line positions.


  "We put our heads down and worked around the clock for nearly a month to produce a bipartisan, bicameral bill to address the emergency needs of our country," the bipartisan group of about a dozen lawmakers said in a statement. "Our consensus bill was the foundation of this final package."


  Republicans were most intent on reviving the Paycheck Protection Program with $284 billion, which would cover a second round of PPP grants to especially hard-hit businesses. Democrats won set-asides for low-income and minority communities.


  Late-breaking decisions would limit $300 per week bonus jobless benefits -- one half the supplemental federal unemployment benefit provided under the CARES Act in March -- to 11 weeks instead of 16 weeks as before. The direct $600 stimulus payment to most people would be half the March payment, subject to the same income limits in which an individual's payment begins to phase out after $75,000.


  After the announcement, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced additional details, including $25 billion in rental assistance, $15 billion for theaters and other live venues, $82 billion for local schools, colleges and universities, and $10 billion for child care.


  Still, Democrats wanted more. Pelosi, in a letter to colleagues, called the package an initial step. "In 31 days, when Joe Biden enters the White House, more help will be on the way," Pelosi said.


  The governmentwide appropriations bill would fund agencies through next September. That measure was likely to provide a last $1.4 billion installment for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall as a condition of winning his signature.


  The bill was an engine to carry much of Capitol Hill's unfinished business, including an almost 400-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental and coastal protection projects. Another addition would extend a batch of soon-to-expire tax breaks, including one for craft brewers, wineries and distillers.


  It also would carry numerous clean energy provisions, $7 billion to increase access to broadband, $4 billion to help other nations vaccinate their people, $14 billion for cash-starved transit systems, Amtrak and airports.


  Democrats failed in a monthslong battle to deliver direct fiscal relief to states and local governments, but they successfully pressed for $22 billion would help states and local governments with COVID-19-related health expenses like testing and vaccines.


  The end-of-session rush also promised relief for victims of shockingly steep surprise medical bills, a phenomenon that often occurs when providers drop out of insurance company networks.

It’s stories like these, as much as any sense of personal tradition, that push Vassar onward.
 “I mean, there’s just millions of stories you hear out there,” Vassar said. “I just can’t quit until I can’t do it. I just can’t. Too many people get the joy.”
 Vassar Village has been a staple of the community for about 20 years, but like so many traditions, Vassar can’t remember exactly how or when it started. She said she’s been collecting the pieces for at least 25 years and spent countless thousands of dollars on them.
 The tradition began during the days when she roamed the courthouse as an employee, which she did for 39 years until 2015, because the place was like a second home to her and its people were a large extended family.
 It’s a living art installation in the sense that it’s never the same as it was the year before. Vassar maps out the layout once, setting the small houses and Santa’s workshop and skating rinks to make sure they look right before she’ll pick them all up again to make sure where and how strings of lights need to run and do it all over again. When each house, building, tree and figurine, there are many hundreds of pieces that must be individually placed.
 “It’s like a major jigsaw puzzle,” Vassar said.
 The display space is a low-slung L-shaped platform just inside the main entrance to the courthouse. The work wreaks havoc on Vassar’s knees and back, especially after four days of stooping over it.
 “Oh, (it’s) horrible, just horrible,” she said of the aches and pains.
 On the Friday morning after Thanksgiving, this year’s village was at most a third completed, which was still a lot of individual pieces in place. But it only served to highlight just how large her collection of miniatures must be.
 “There’s a big space in the basement plumb-full of this stuff,” said Tammy Eastin, Vassar’s niece who was helping her that day.
 “Yeah, I could fill this probably three times, full,” Vassar said, pointing at the display space. “Plus, I have storage units that have more.”
 Her newest addition is a tree adorned in crystal to pair with a crystal palace that she rarely sets out. She said she was just trying to do something to “break up the ho-hum” of this year’s display. Though well-established, tradition need not be stale.
 Holiday traditions persist as a bridge to the past. They’re a solemn admission that we’re not interested in wholly new ways of doing things; the ways we’ve always done them have served us well. They’re an anchor in a storm, and when a year like 2020 comes along to thrash us around, to take so much from so many, traditions are a semblance of normalcy. They remind us of better days and that better days are still ahead of us.
 Hazel Vassar knows this all too well as her traditions have become our traditions.
 But a smaller conception of family will undoubtedly be on her mind when Dec. 25 rolls around. It’s Christmas Day, and therefore a natural time to think of family and take stock of who’s there and who isn’t.
 For Vassar, Dec. 25 isn’t just Christmas Day, and that fact makes Don’s absence all the more significant.
 Everything in front of Vassar, every tradition, large and small, will have foundations in that day. In addition to Christmas Day, Dec. 25 would have been her and Don’s 57th wedding anniversary.

Jacques had "been around dog sledding my whole life" and worked for Continental Divide at Togwotee when she began dreaming of her own dogs and business. She had seen during the busy parts of winter that the business "turned away hundreds of people" who asked about tours just because there weren't enough sleds and hours to give a ride to everyone who expressed an interest. She also found that being far from Jackson and offering half-day and full-day tours also cut into potential customers.
 So a location right in Teton Village and offering hourlong tours meant she could plug in to a segment of the public that wanted a tour but was dissuaded by the time and distance involved, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports.
 "I knew there was a market," she said. "We have customers who don't have a half day or a full day, so we have our own little niche."
 Being based at the horse corrals near the Village's parking lots, in sight of big fancy hotels, is another advantage. Another plus was that she had worked for the National Elk Refuge and Scenic Safaris, knew people at the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce and had worked some hotel front desks: "I had a few contacts who knew this was something I was trying to start," she said.
 Tours run north from Teton Village into open space along Moose-Wilson Road toward the entrance to Grand Teton National Park. The runs are a bit under 4 miles and take about 45 minutes.
 The distance is perfect for her crew, which she calls "old and fuzzies." While racing dogs and a great many sled haulers must be young, hers are mostly 8 or 10 years old, dogs that have worked in other operations and whose careers might be nearly done if not for a chance to work on shorter runs.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Forward Kyle Kuzma has agreed to a three-year, $40 million extension to remain with the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers, a person familiar with the deal said Sunday.
 The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Lakers didn't disclose the terms of the deal in their announcement of an extension. ESPN first reported the terms of Kuzma's rookie contract extension, which begins in 2021 and includes a player option for the 2023-24 season.
 Kuzma has been a key component of the Lakers' core for three seasons since the team acquired him in a draft-day trade in 2017.

We also hope that Ramaco will do the right thing by being a good neighbor here in the valley and be open to talking with the neighbors," said nearest landowner to the mine Anton Bocek, in a statement released by PRBRC Wednesday.
 The appeal included several issues for hearing, including a patently deficient mine permit, the DEQ's inability to remedy deficiencies through a permit condition, the application not include all facilities, haul roads and traffic plans for the haul roads, inaccuracy in estimating the amount of coal that will be mined and lack of identification of the coal mine operator.

INGLEWOOD, Calif.
 The Los Angeles Rams were poised to celebrate wrapping up a playoff spot with a win on Sunday. Instead, they have to grapple with letting a golden opportunity slip away after handing the New York Jets their first victory.
 The Rams' 23-20 loss makes them the fifth team since 1978 to go down to defeat when favored by at least 17 points. Not only did Los Angeles (9-5) fail to wrap up its fourth postseason berth in five years, but it fell out of the NFC West lead.
 "We're all sick to our stomachs. Everyone is upset," defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day said.
 The obvious question after the game was if they overlooked a winless team? Los Angeles came in rested after a 24-3 win over New England on Dec. 10, but it looked dazed for most of the game.
 "That question is always going to be up in the air. With the room we have I don't think that's the case," offensive tackle Rob Havenstein said. "Obviously it didn't translate to a winning game."

Last night's "Saturday Night Live" performances were a long time in the making for Dua Lipa. She was originally scheduled to be the musical guest on March 28th, but at that point everyone, including Lipa, was living under lockdown. So the artist postponed her performance and spent the majority of 2020 promoting her highly anticipated sophomore album, _Future Nostalgia,_ virtually. There was her neon orange _Tiny Desk set_, the _beamed-in AMAs performance of "Levitating,"_, and her _online-only rendition of "Boys Will Be Boys"_ for Billboard's annual Women in Music event. After a string of digital gigs, it must've felt good to be in front of a live audience. At least, it looked like it did.


  Dancing in front of a cube constructed out of flashing neon lights, Lipa performed her hit "Don't Start Now." The song is a break-up banger, a synthy sad-pop masterpiece, and watching a smiling and sweaty Lipa almost run out of breath as she made her way through it was the closest I got to actually going to a concert in 2020.
