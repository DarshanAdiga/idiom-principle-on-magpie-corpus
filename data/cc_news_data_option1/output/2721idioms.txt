This year, I didn't do any of this. Technically, I made one trip for a few herbs and a tomato plant, but I didn't buy any flowers. I couldn't. Something inside me didn't feel like celebrating. It was a hard decision, but I decided to go on strike.
 I don't have to explain that 2020 is a year for upsets of massive proportion. So many things are different, and the world has been described as one big game of "Jumanji." We have braced ourselves for the terrible upset in the months to come and didn't even flinch at the threat of "Murder Hornets" two months ago. My decision to go on "strike" with my happy flower time was all about me, allowing myself to feel all the "big feels" this year is bringing. It has been said that there are several seasons and a time for everything under the sun. This is the time for something alright, and by golly, if we are not all feeling it. The great part about embracing the turbulence is knowing that it isn't permanent, and better times will come. If we don't honor our selves when experiencing pain, it is hard to see beauty when it finally arrives. And it will come.
 How do we honor ourselves right now? It can be a scary thing to be reacquainted with grief and loss. For many of us, when dark feelings and emotions come a-knocking, it can be hard to kick them to the curb, as they sometimes hunker down and stay. Embracing them seems to be the last thing we want to do. To truly see grief for what it is, we have to experience it so we can get through it. To do this cautiously, we establish scaffolding first to ensure our safety. People who love us, routines to cling to, goals to set, and future dreams help accomplish this task. We need to talk more, listen more, and be as gentle with ourselves as a mother is with a newborn baby. We give ourselves time, patience, understanding, and love until it is time to rally again and rise.
 I went on strike, yes. I'm feeling big feels; it's true. I'm also experiencing times of great joy. I'm making time to go camping and being outdoors. I'm making plans to paint my house without the fear of trampling and crushing all my colorful blooms. I made a simple syrup from mint and basil and take time each day to smell my herbs and really taste their freshness. I'm doing things a bit differently to adapt. Like nature, I'm finding another way. I'm not really fearing the second half of 2020, instead, I'm looking for adventures. I still get down from time to time and find myself discouraged with daily news and social media. It's then that I put down my phone and focus on the things I can control. I can make my world a better place, with or without flowers on my front porch. I can let people know that they matter and inspire others to do the same. You matter and deserve to feel safe, accepted, and validated. Be you and embrace 2020, even if it means by finding another way. #YouMatterBemidji.

Although he played his first league game in Plymouth aged 18, James was 14-years-old when he started competing.
 He would spend the summer hustling other kids out of their pocket money.
 He said: "My family were all into darts when I was growing up. I started playing in my granddad's garage when I was nine or ten-years-old.
 "He used to put a bed sheet over the bonnet of his Ford Escort to stop bounce outs. Sadly for him, it didn't work very well.
 "I began playing darts at Snowlands caravan park in Par, Cornwall. My mum had a caravan on site, so I used to spend most weekends there and almost the whole six week schools holidays.
 "They had a little club house on site and it had a board. There wasn't much else to do down there.
 "Around 15 of us would meet on an evening and play games for £1 coins.

The film “Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets” premiered as part of the documentary competition at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, where it was described as a portrait of the closing night at a long-running dive bar in Las Vegas. In reality, the movie was shot over several nights at a bar in New Orleans, not scripted but definitely staged, with the subjects hand selected by the filmmakers.
 So if it’s not a strict documentary and it’s also not a conventional fiction feature, then what exactly is this movie? Does the distinction matter? The most important thing is that it is genuinely great, a singular and moving glimpse of loneliness, community and finding the strength to face another day.
 Filmmaking brothers Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross have been among the most eccentric and exciting documentary filmmakers for more than 10 years now, with films including “45365,” a snapshot of a small town; “Tchoupitoulas,” a coming-of-age portrait; and “Contemporary Color,” an erstwhile concert film. They have long played with form, and the playful bobbing and weaving of their new film — something that feels so naturalistic and happenstance, yet is constructed to build in momentum and impact — may be their finest achievement yet.
 The denizens of the bar, this ad hoc community, have a thrown-together diversity of age, race, gender, orientation and identity, which makes it feel like a snapshot of America, with all the good and bad baggage that implies. Names are caught on the fly, sometimes not at all.

It’s hard for the first thing you notice about a HD remake not to be the updated visuals, and in the case of _Rehydrated_ , the graphics are beautifully vibrant, crisp and yet perfectly loyal to the original game as well as the SpongeBob cartoon itself. Jellyfish Fields is bristling with stunning fauna, the updated models for the enemies and Bikini Bottom characters are bursting with life and personality, and the new facial expressions and animations make for a hilarious and charming accompaniment to the true-to-form comedic dialogue ever-present in the SpongeBob franchise. Though occasional graphical errors do slightly detract from the polish of _Rehydrated_ ’s visuals, these are few and far between.
