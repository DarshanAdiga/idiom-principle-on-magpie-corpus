"I started out by checking out what happened with the heart transplant in 1968," said Jones in an interview with CBS Local's DJ Sixsmith. "I started looking at what happened to this man named Bruce Tucker and in a nutshell, he was a working man, a Black man and a factory worker in Richmond. He had just finished his work day and work week and he was hanging out with some friends. He was sitting on a wall and had the misfortune of falling back and hitting his head. He was rushed over to the emergency room at the Medical College of Virginia and his vital signs were good. He was agitated, but he was still very much alive. He went into a coma that night and 21 hours later, the hospital had pulled the plug on him and had removed his heart, without any consent by his family and they also took his kidneys. I spent three years digging into this story and I found out it linked to a whole darker side, not only of medicine in the South, but in the entire United States."
