 The festival enables tour operators, hoteliers, guides, transporters and a myriad of handicraft artisans and restaurant owners to earn enough to sustain them through the lean monsoon season, Mr. Yepthomi said.
 We have absolutely no tourist traffic since February and we are certain that if this situation continues then the entire industry will collapse in another six months,” he added.
 The festival, for which thousands of people make travel plans not only to Nagaland but also several other States in the Northeast, is being held over the last 20 years.
 Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for Aatmanirbhar Bharat, Mr. Yepthomi said small-scale theme-based events, such as Made in Nagaland, Crafted in Nagaland, Flowers of Nagaland, can be organised in district headquarters so as to manage crowding. This will also act as the right platform in giving opportunities to local entrepreneurs in rebuilding a community towards sustainability, which has always been the goal of Hornbill Festival, he added.
 The State’s tourism industry will also get an opportunity to revive itself, he said.
 The scale and the type of the festival may be considered after studying the ground realities in October- November, he said.
 Stating that the Tourism Department is working out a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for a steady reopening, Mr. Yemtphomi said the sector will have to redesign its services and utilities and institute certain protocols, including social distancing rules, contactless payment, besides management of the number of people within a facility.
 The department is working to set up Destination Management Organisations in coordination with representatives from key departments of the State such as Health, Home, Transport and Municipal Affairs to ensure efficient flow of tourists, and safe and sustainable use of tourism services and infrastructure, he said.
 Mr. Yepthomi, an MLA, said the Tourism Department would hold a consultative meeting with Kohima-based tribal hohos for their views before taking any decision on the Hornbill Festival.
 He said the government has started gathering details of around 20,000 people who came back to the state from other parts of the country due to the lockdown to conduct training for skill enhancement so that they can be provided employment in the hospitality sector.
 We are trying to provide employment opportunities to these people and will come out with the modalities within a couple of weeks, he said.

Players cannot leave the Disney campus due to concerns about contracting COVID-19, which continues to spike in Florida. More than 10,000 cases have been reported in nine of the last 10 days within the state, with 360,000 confirmed total cases. NBA players are being testing frequently inside the bubble and are wearing biometric devices that measure vital signs.
 The Pacers could be inside the bubble for up to three months, depending on how far they advance in the playoffs.
 “It’s what I expected,” Pacers guard Edmond Sumner said. “I didn’t expect much. I came down here for business anyways. It’s not bad. Everything is fine.
 “I only told them how the first few days, I’m a very picky eater, but once I was able to kind of venture off, order my own food, I mean, I’m fine. I have really no complaints. I’m not really a high-maintenance guy.”
 Sumner has passed the free time in his hotel room watching Apple TV and playing video games.
 “I kind of do what I do at home,” Sumner said. “I don’t do much when I’m in Indy, either. I just stay home, watch TV, chill with my girlfriend, but now I’m down here by myself, so I just stay in the room.”
 Pacers forward Doug McDermott said the toughest part was staying in the team hotel in quarantine for more than 48 hours before the first full practice in Orlando.
 “We were all in a good rhythm playing back in Indy, working out, lifting and then having those two days of nothing and diving right into training camp -- but for the most part I think we’ve handled it pretty well.” McDermott said. “The NBA has done an incredible job of putting us in a good spot here. The food has gotten a lot better, they take really good care of us and there’s no surprise there because the NBA does things over the top, so it’s been first class all of the way.”
 McDermott took teammates T.J. McConnell and Victor Oladipo out for a golf outing during an off day last week.

If presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins the presidential election in November, Iran could suddenly turn from a bullish driver for oil prices into a bearish factor if it resumes up to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil exports.   Currently, there is a consensus among analysts and international agencies that the oil market is tightening and will continue to tighten, lifting oil prices through next year.  
 Oil demand is expected to rise next year by between 5 million bpd and 7 million bpd compared to this year's lows, according to OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA)--in the absence of a mass return to lockdowns. The OPEC+ group is set to further ease its collective production cuts. In theory, the current expectations of supply and demand in 2021 are bullish for oil prices.
 Yet, the market shouldn't discount one political and geopolitical factor that could upend current oil price forecasts for next year. The U.S. presidential election in November could install a new administration in the White House - of a President Biden - that would be inclined to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal and potentially ease the current sanctions on Tehran's oil exports.
 The return of 1-2 million bpd of Iranian oil on the global market would cap oil price gains next year, a leading oil analyst said last week.
 "If you have Joe Biden as president he could basically take the US back into the [Iranian] Nuclear deal and you could see a million plus Iranian barrels hit the market. These are the kind of things I think will be very important into the trajectory of oil into 2021," Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider in an interview last week.

The Dakota Access Pipeline is currently mired in a legal battle that has no definitive end in sight. Earlier this month, the extremely divisive pipeline that has been the subject of widespread protests and sociopolitical conflict from its inception, was ordered by a district court to shut down operations and dry out by August 5.
 This ruling immediately sparked huge waves of both celebration and backlash, as well as a near-immediate appeal. As long as the matter remains tied up in litigation, however, a U.S. appeals court has ruled that the Dakota Access Pipeline can continue running. Despite this temporary permission to continue business as usual, this litigious quagmire is causing local oil companies to ask a lot of questions and reconsider their business model as "the oil industry is grappling with uncertainty as it ponders how to keep shipping Bakken crude to market," as described by North Dakota's Bismarck Tribune.
 As the oil industry waits with bated breath to see what will be the outcome of the Dakota Access Pipeline appeal, oil transportation has become a hot topic of conversation. If this pipeline can be shut down, why not others? What happens then? "Many observers anticipate a shutdown could result in a resurgence of trains carrying Bakken crude," reports the Bismarck Tribune, "a prospect that has rail safety advocates and farmers concerned." If the Dakota Access Pipeline is shut down, experts project that the shuttering of this major oil artery "would eventually prompt oil companies to ship another 200,000 barrels per day of Bakken crude via rail, the equivalent of about three more oil trains leaving the region each day."

Made by Veggiecraft Farms, these cups are ready after just three-and-a-half minutes in the microwave. This saves you so much time because you don't have to wait for water to boil or for noodles to cook. For those who have trouble getting in their suggested daily dose of vegetables, these noodles are made from cauliflower and sweet potatoes, but are flavored with cheddar cheese so you still get that creamy taste you expect from traditional mac.
 There's also a marinara flavor that is ready in the same amount of time, so you can switch it up every once in a while if you're not in the mood for something cheesy. According to the Veggiecraft site, these microwavable cups are made to be high in protein, fiber, and nutrients, with each cup clocking in at 11 grams of protein,
 Like most microwavable meals, all you have to do is add water before putting it in the microwave. From there, you'll be able to stir in the cheddar cheese or marinara to finish up the meal. These cups were spotted at Walmart by @dadbodsnacks, and although the label suggests these are great for kids, I'd think adults would love these things as well. I won't tell if you don't!

Surfing through the cable TV channels this past Saturday afternoon, I happened upon ESPN expecting to see live Corn Hole, which has dominated the weekends over the past few months.
   
 But it wasn't on. Instead, I got caught up in the Clint Eastwood baseball movie "Trouble with the curve."
   
 When the movie ended, I went on about my business. Left the television on.
   
 Moments later, I looked up and noticed a baseball game on the screen. I just figured it was a replay of the 2018 World Series or something like that.
   
 Besides, isn't that what we've been relegated to since sports as we know them came to a screeching halt four months ago.
   
 Wrong.
   
 It was live baseball. Live baseball? Are you kidding me?
   
 It was true.
   
 The Pittsburgh Pirates were taking on the Cleveland Indians in a "spring training'' game.
   
 The game grabbed my attention. I didn't recognize many of the players, didn't care.
   
 All I know is that it was baseball and it was live. That's all I needed to know.
   
 After four months of wallowing in the outbreak of COVID-19 and the coronarivus pandemic, it was a relief to actually watch live sports.
   
 Granted, it was just an exhibition game and didn't mean much. But it was real, with real pitchers, catchers and hitters.
   
 Those of you who know me know that I am a baseball guy.
   
 When the Runyon Sports Complex opened up last Monday, I was the first to volunteer to go cover a doubleheader. Besides, it's what we, as sports writers do. And give me a doubleheader to write about any time.
   
 Thanks ESPN for broadcasting that "game" on Saturday. It's a prelude of what will be the real thing on Thursday when Major League Baseball opens its season with each team scheduled to play 60 games. The shortened season will be different but at least it will be live.
   
 So what that there will be no fans in the stands and fake cheers will be piped in the stadiums.
   
 So what that players won't "high-5'' or fist bump and instead will pantomime air-fives and chest bumps.
   
 So what that umpires and some players will be wearing masks.
   
 This is the coronavirus baseball era. Strange as it may seem, it'll still be live baseball. And isn't that what we've yearned for since this pandemic hit in mid-March.
   
 I, for one, am all in and praying that no more hurdles will stop American's Game from being played ever again.
   
 There's a different feel, for sure. But like everything else, we'll get used to it.
   
 Just give me live baseball every day and I can live again.

Los trabajadores afirman que sus condiciones laborales supuestamente no son las más adecuadas en medio de la emergencia por el coronavirus.      “Usan a los mismos empleados para limpiar, no traen a profesionales, y es lo que estamos exigiendo”, dijo María Rodríguez, trabajadora de McDonald’s. “Nosotros somos humanos y merecemos los mismos derechos de todos”.      Como parte de este día de Acción Nacional también se llevó a cabo una protesta en la universidad de USC para exigir le quiten fondos a la policía de esa universidad y lo inviertan en apoyo a las minorías.      En cuanto a trabajadores de comida rápida, Telemundo 52 contactó a McDonald’s y la empresa señaló que ha extremado sus protocolos de seguridad y repartido más de 100 millones de máscaras a empleados y ha colocado barreras protectoras en sus restaurantes.

At this point, there’s little excuse for any of us to not be doing our part.
 In explaining her decision, School Superintendent Angela Hairston cited the high numbers of cases in North Carolina and the cost of keeping students and staff safe inside school buildings, money that the district doesn’t have.
 Our schools have been underfunded for quite some time now; asking teachers and administrators to take on the extra duty of coronavirus safety monitor would be too much, especially when Forsyth County is one of the eight counties in the state running the greatest risk of rapid spread.
 Hairston also noted a staff survey that indicated nearly 20 percent of teachers say they were fearful of coming back or needed special accommodations.
 “We must have their full support and endorsement if we are to reopen safely,” she said.
 Lori Farrington, a teacher at Walkertown Middle School, was among those reluctant to return. “Plan B says I should be a martyr,” she said.

Plenty of food brands have tried to get into the fashion space and as someone who has seen them all, I say this with love...most of them are not exactly fit for fashion week. But sometimes a brand comes along and makes merch that is not only fun but also truly fashionable and chic. Leave it to Dunkaroos to create merch we'd wanna wear anywhere.
 The brand, which made its glorious return this summer, announced its merchandise line today. We got to see a ton of it and it's a pretty much a dream come true for everyone from nostalgia-loving '90s kids (me!) to hip Gen Z-ers who are dressing like it's the '90s all over it again (I would know, I am on TiKTok, OK??).
 This merch collection features "the glory of the '90s," according to the brand, and is full of neon and bold patterns, much of which is made to look either like Dunkaroos packaging, its mascot, or the snack itself.
 The collection ranges in price from $25-$60 and includes things like dunking cookie socks, which come in a two-pack for $25, a watch with the Dunakroos logo on it for $25, a yellow bucket hat with cookies on it for $35, and my personal fav, a "camp shirt" with the Dunkaroos mascot on it for $50.
 If you're already planning your next Dunkaroo-inspired outfit to wear while you snack on Dunkaroos and Sunny D while binging _Saved By The Bell_ re-runs, you're in luck. The merch collection will be available on dunkaroos.com starting this Wednesday, July 22, at 11 a.m. ET. Set an alarm, break out your debit card, and prepare to feel really fashionable...and maybe a little hungry.

Central head coach Patrick Nix’s debut with the team was set to be a good one given the Red Devils were hosting a Peach County team that has consistently been in the hunt for a state championship. While Nix and his staff were beginning to weigh their options for the season opener, he explained they are going to sit tight and wait on the AHSAA to announce its own decision.
 Nix’s plans to lead the Red Devils onto the field for the first time may very well have to wait one more week given Monday’s developments. Either way, Nix explained his focus is on making the most of what is in his control and waiting for guidance from the governing body on what to do next.

We appreciate the deliberation that went into the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County school board’s decision to move forward in the fall with remote learning. We’re sure the decision was difficult, but of all the options possible, the board wisely chose the safest option for the health of our children and the community, which must be paramount.
 School board members listened to a variety of opinions from parents, teachers and students before voting 8-1 on Friday to proceed with full-time remote learning for the first nine weeks of the 2020-21 school year, which begins Aug. 17. After the first nine weeks, if progress has been made against the coronavirus, the school board could opt for a partly virtual, partly in-person model, known as Plan B.
 A lot of that will depend on whether local residents can practice good pandemic hygiene, made evident by a decrease in the number of those infected and a reduction in deaths.

I'm pretty sure in the Bush or Reagan years you could get similar charts of official woke positions. Though gay marriage was largely the furthest frontier. Global warning didnt have serious effects yet. Plus war & overpopulation & poverty/starvation were still the overwhelming worries. 20 years of "war" in the Mideast hid that there wasn't that much war there, and even less elsewhere. Hypersensitivity to "security" Is one inherited feature of this much less dangerous landscape - on left and right. While we didnt actually "cure" our social ills - many just subsided with increased trade And relative prosperity and freedom of movement (sans the more totalitarian states), we've been left with the confused notion that we solve the big problems rather than put in infrastructure to hold back the worst.

More importantly, she shows them what they can do to change themselves and dismantle this pernicious system.

He survived to become a senior member of Congress, to be awarded the Medal of Freedom by the nation’s first African American president and to be considered a national hero. None of it ever seemed to go to his head, though. There was too much work still to do.
 When Lewis spoke to groups of young people, he often began by telling of his childhood near Troy, Ala. His parents were former sharecroppers who had scraped together enough money to buy their own little spread, and one of his chores was the care and feeding of the family’s chickens. He would take a Bible out to the yard and preach to the poultry, intent on saving their souls. It was a calling that led him to study at a Baptist seminary in Nashville, where he met leaders of the nascent civil rights movement — and found his higher calling.
 Lewis would urge young audiences not to follow the rules but to “get in good trouble” by pushing for fairness and justice. “Get in the way,” he would exhort activists who were pushing, often rudely, for positive change. “Keep getting in the way.”
 He marveled at the Black Lives Matter protests because of their unprecedented size and diversity. He saw this movement as “so much more massive and all inclusive” than the protests he had led and witnessed in his youth — and allowed himself to hope that this time, there would be “no turning back.”
 But Lewis was never under the illusion that the road ahead would be easy. He had lived to see the 1965 Voting Rights Act — whose passage was spurred by the way Lewis and others were brutally attacked on the Selma-to-Montgomery March — have its guts ripped out by a conservative Supreme Court, giving Southern states license to impose new laws designed to limit African American suffrage.
 So please, no crocodile tears or soaring words of praise for Lewis from Republicans whose strategy for winning in November is to keep African Americans from voting. If you are trying to take away the rights this great American suffered a fractured skull to win, you don’t really admire him at all. You spit on his legacy and dishonor yourselves.

“Kind of babysitting them,” McDermott said. “They haven’t really golfed a whole lot in their life, so I had to teach them how to swing. So it took just about three-and-a-half hours to play nine holes, so I’ll leave it at that.”
 Pacers guard Aaron Holiday said those kind of team-building activities -- golfing together, going out to eat -- could translate on the court when the Pacers begin their season restart Aug. 1 against the Philadelphia 76ers.
 “Hanging out with your teammates, that’s great,” Holiday said. “That’s all we have right now, so that will be good for team camaraderie.”
 Pacers coach Nate McMillan has used the time to not only get his team better on the court but teach lessons off the court as well. McMillan held a movie night last week to watch the documentary 13th, which explores the intersection of race, justice and mass incarceration within the United States.
 Afterward, the team held a discussion on race relations in the United States and the protests that are still going on in the wake of George Floyd’s death in late May.
 Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon said the documentary reiterated a strong social justice message the NBA intends to convey once the season restarts.
 “That’s the point of all of these protests,” Brogdon said. “Everything that’s going on is to make the country better, is for people to see the humanity in the black community -- and black people specifically -- and to stop discrimination, to stop all the racial profiling, to stop all these things that are going on and to actually change the system.”
 On the court, Brogdon said at first it was difficult to get into a routine because practices were scheduled for different times during the week due to court availability.
 “You can’t have a steady routine because practice (time) changes,” Brogdon said. “But you can know, 'Today I’m going to lift, today I’m going to get my core work in, today I’m going to get a massage.' I always have a routine. That’s what gives me my confidence.”
 Brogdon also said it’s important for NBA players to show perspective and appreciation for everyone working on Disney’s campus to ensure things are running smoothly and safe.
 “There are people here working extremely hard to make this as comfortable for the NBA players as possible,” Brogdon said. “So it’s not my job to complain or insult food or do anything like that. The food has been good. The food has been enough.
 “We just have got to be grateful. There are a lot of people outside of this bubble who are struggling, so we need to keep that in mind.”

The famed Hornbill Festival in Nagaland is unlikely to be held this year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior official said on Monday. The 10-day Hornbill Festival that usually starts on December 1 celebrates the culture and heritage of different tribes of the State. It is attended by lakhs of people from across India and abroad.
 The tourism industry is in a dire condition due to the pandemic and if the situation doesn’t improve, the government may not be in a position to host the festival, Tourism Advisor H Khehovi Yepthomi said.
 The tourism industry in Nagaland is largely dependent on the mega event with the festivities starting as early as mid-October at local levels and culminating in December.
 The festival enables tour operators, hoteliers, guides, transporters and a myriad of handicraft artisans and restaurant owners to earn enough to sustain them through the lean monsoon season, Mr. Yepthomi said.
 We have absolutely no tourist traffic since February and we are certain that if this situation continues then the entire industry will collapse in another six months,” he added.
 The festival, for which thousands of people make travel plans not only to Nagaland but also several other States in the Northeast, is being held over the last 20 years.
 Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for Aatmanirbhar Bharat, Mr. Yepthomi said small-scale theme-based events, such as Made in Nagaland, Crafted in Nagaland, Flowers of Nagaland, can be organised in district headquarters so as to manage crowding. This will also act as the right platform in giving opportunities to local entrepreneurs in rebuilding a community towards sustainability, which has always been the goal of Hornbill Festival, he added.
 The State’s tourism industry will also get an opportunity to revive itself, he said.
 The scale and the type of the festival may be considered after studying the ground realities in October- November, he said.
 Stating that the Tourism Department is working out a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for a steady reopening, Mr. Yemtphomi said the sector will have to redesign its services and utilities and institute certain protocols, including social distancing rules, contactless payment, besides management of the number of people within a facility.
 The department is working to set up Destination Management Organisations in coordination with representatives from key departments of the State such as Health, Home, Transport and Municipal Affairs to ensure efficient flow of tourists, and safe and sustainable use of tourism services and infrastructure, he said.
 Mr. Yepthomi, an MLA, said the Tourism Department would hold a consultative meeting with Kohima-based tribal hohos for their views before taking any decision on the Hornbill Festival.
 He said the government has started gathering details of around 20,000 people who came back to the state from other parts of the country due to the lockdown to conduct training for skill enhancement so that they can be provided employment in the hospitality sector.
 We are trying to provide employment opportunities to these people and will come out with the modalities within a couple of weeks, he said.
