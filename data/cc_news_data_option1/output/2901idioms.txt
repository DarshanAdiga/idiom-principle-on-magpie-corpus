I played in a league with some of my friends in college for three or four years. However, in 1994, I was invited to join the Clarinda Baseball League and am still actively involved in the league. We held our annual auction to select our players for the shortened 2020 season last Sunday.
 However, like so many other things in society, baseball has been dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to safety concerns over the virus, the start of the season was delayed and only 60 games will be played during the regular season this year instead of the traditional 162. Various other rules changes have also been implemented and the teams will be playing in empty stadiums.
 Other sports have also slowly eased back into action over the last month as NASCAR has returned to the track, the PGA Tour is underway and both the NBA and NHL are working to salvage their playoffs. The NFL moved held its player draft as scheduled in April and has announced plans to open training camp at the end of July.
 However, given the health concerns, political unrest and economic conditions facing the United States at this time, many people are probably wondering if we should really be worrying about playing some silly games.
 Well, I believe the answer to that question is very simple: We need a distraction and sports have always helped us through the most challenging times in our nation’s history.
 During World War I and World War II, Major League Baseball supported the war effort. The game raised the morale of soldiers overseas, while stars like Iowa native Bob Feller left successful careers to join the military.
 Then, in 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. This opened the door for many other great African Americans to not only compete in sports, but enter professions they were previously restricted from.
 Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Americans were left asking the same questions we face today. The games, races and matches continued and they provided fans with an outlet to cope with the aftermath of that horrific day. Sports provided fans with something to cheer about and in the process helped shape how people responded to their new reality.
 Again, we are faced with a new reality and again I believe sports will help set an example on how to respond to the challenges existing in the world today. For that reason I say, “Play Ball!”

Inspector Nick Butler, responsible for neighbourhood policing in Mansfield, said: “This was a significant and sophisticated cannabis grow that appears to have been operating for some time.
 “There are hundreds of plants inside and early estimates suggest they have a value of at least £650,000.
 “The community have been telling us for some time that they are concerned and that drugs are a real problem, so we are tackling all kinds of illegal drug use.
 “I am totally aware that some people feel we should be focussing on Class A drugs, but it is also crucial that we tackle these cannabis factories because vulnerable people are being exploited within them – quite often locked inside and left without food and water by the by the organised gangs who are doing this.
 “And this isn’t the kind of cannabis people know about from years ago; this is extremely strong, cultivated cannabis that does an awful lot of harm.
 “This is one of many cannabis factories in Nottinghamshire. We know about them and we are working our way through them systematically dismantling them, arresting people and bringing people to justice. So keep the information coming to us and we will keep busting those doors.”

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the gold smuggling case on Thursday grilled Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's former principal secretary M Sivasankar. He was suspended from service last week after his alleged link with one of the accused in the case Swapna Suresh surfaced.He was interrogated by the Customs department for nine hours on July 14. He was instrumental in getting a key post for Suresh in Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT department. She allegedly used her proximity with the powerful principal secretary to dabble in corridors of power.There are reports that he arranged a flat just outside the secretariat for the husband of Swapna Suresh and another accused PS Sarith. The accused had later used this flat for their smuggling activities. Sivasankar had earlier told the Customs that he arranged this over friendship and he did not know about their illegal activities. A senior IAS officer, he was the CM's blue-eyed boy and was instrumental in bringing many IT and social projects to the state. In another development, the NIA has sought the CCTV footage of the state secretariat and sent a letter to chief secretary Biswas Mehta in this regard. Earlier, when customs sought this, his office had told them that the cameras developed snags during lightening in May. The NIA has also sought details of the service provider.When asked about this, the CM did not give a direct reply. "Let the NIA carry out its investigation. Its probe is going in the right direction. Why do you want to jump the gun," he retorted. But the opposition has stepped up pressure on him. "The probe has reached the office of the CM. He has no moral responsibility to remain in power," said BJP state president K Surendran. Congress state chief Mullappally Ramachandran also sought his resignation. The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5 when PS Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate in the state capital, was arrested when he went to receive a consignment in the name of an official of the consulate. Later, 30 kg of gold was retrieved from the consignment. Five days later, Swapna Suresh, a senior IT official and her friend Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru. Later the case was handed over to the NIA.The Customs department has deferred the transfer of key officials who are investigating the gold smuggling case following an outrage. The Union Home Ministry has also expressed serious reservations over the issue saying such a controversy should have been avoided when the investigation was going in the right track, a senior official familiar with the development said.The sudden transfer of six superintendents and two inspectors attached with Kochi unit of the Customs who are part of the ongoing investigation was issued by Mohammad Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, late on Wednesday. After the issue triggered a controversy the Customs department made it clear that it was a routine transfer and it had been deferred for the time being.

New Delhi Safdarjung, Palam and Lodhi Road stations in Delhi have already recorded 50%, 37% and 64% rain in excess for July. The monsoon deficiency (since June 1) which was 29% on July 21 reduced to 16% on Thursday, according to data with India Meteorological Department (IMD).An excess of 19% to a deficiency of -19% is considered the normal category by IMD, so Delhi is not categorised as rain-deficient anymore.Most of the rainfall which helped cover a massive monsoon deficiency of 52% (as on July 16) was recorded in the past four days between the evening of July 18 and July 22. "The heavy and moderate spells of rain received within four days helped cover the deficiency. Since July 1 though, Delhi has received rain in 20 or 21 days but it has been extremely light or trace rainfall at most," said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.But now rainfall over northwest India, including Delhi, will reduce significantly with the western end of the monsoon trough moving northwards. "The monsoon trough is moving to the Himalayan foothills and the wind direction has changed to northwesterly over north-west India. Even in the hills there is no wind convergence as such. So, there will be very light rain in the hills and northern plains, if at all. Around July 26, the eastern end of the monsoon trough will start shifting, bringing a lot of rain to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and other parts of north-west India," added Shrivastava.The western end of the monsoon trough at mean sea level is close to the foothills of the Himalayas and the eastern end is near its normal position. It is likely to shift southward towards its normal position around July 25 onwards. The eastern end of the monsoon trough is likely to shift close to foothills of Himalayas from July 26 onwards. IMD warned of very heavy rains in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from July 26 to 28 and over Punjab and Haryana from July 27 to 29. Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread and heavy rain is likely over the east and north-east of India in the next five days. IMD has also forecast widespread rain for the west coast and scattered rain over north-west India.Moderate to severe thunderstorms and lightning are likely over south Bihar, Jharkhand, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Telangana on Friday.

Yoenis Cespedes expects to be the designated hitter for the New York Mets on Friday when they open the season against the Atlanta Braves.
   
 It will be his first major league game in more than two years. Injuries to his feet and legs have sidelined him since July 20, 2018.
   
 Cespedes said he's feeling good and is confident that he'll also play left field at some point this season. But he told reporters through a translator Tuesday that "at least for the first game, for opening day, I'll be the DH."
   
 The 34-year-old slugger, an All-Star in 2014 and 2016, had surgery on both heels and then broke his right ankle in a nasty fall at his Florida ranch. Now he's healthy and eager to help the Mets.
   
 "I think the strongest part of me is my mind, is my mentality," Cespedes said. "I think whether it's a good day or a bad day, my mentality has always been strong. I'll be ready to play once the time comes."
   
 BRUISED
   
 Astros second baseman Jose Altuve bruised his left leg in Houston's exhibition win over Kansas City on Tuesday.
   
 The 2017 AL MVP was injured in a collision at home plate in the fourth inning of the 15-6 win that was the Astros' last tuneup before their opener on Friday against Seattle. The team said he is listed as day to day.
   
 Altuve hit .298 with 31 homers and 74 RBIs in 124 games last season while missing time with leg injuries.
   
 Altuve was one of three Astros who were hit by pitches against the Royals. Kansas City right-hander Jorge Lopez plunked Altuve and Alex Bregman, and George Springer was hit by Jackson Kowar, who took the loss.
   
 ON THE MEND
   
 Masahiro Tanaka threw 20 pitches during batting practice Tuesday and is on track to miss one turn in the New York Yankees' rotation before making his first start July 31 against Boston.
   
 Tanaka walked two in his one inning. It was his first time facing batters since he was hit in the head by Giancarlo Stanton's line drive on July 4. Tanaka is to throw batting practice again on Sunday.
   
 "If everything comes out OK, I should be ready to go," he said through a translator.
   
 He did not use a protective screen. Tanaka thought about getting hit only before delivering his first pitch.
   
 "After I threw that, it was back to business, back to normal," he said.
   
 The 31-year-old right-hander is 75-43 in six major league seasons and is entering the final year of his contract.
   
 POCHE OUT
   
 Tampa Bay Rays left-handed reliever Colin Poche will miss the season after being placed on the 45-day injured list with a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. The team said Tommy John surgery has been recommended.
   
 Catcher Kevan Smith was added to the 40-man roster to replace Poche, who went 5-5 with a 4.70 ERA in 51 appearances last season.
   
 BRAVES ADD VETERAN
   
 The Atlanta Braves signed right-hander Jhoulys Chacin, who pitched for Milwaukee and Boston in 2019, to a one-year contract. Chacin was 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA in five games with Atlanta in 2016 after signing a minor league contract with the team. Chacin was released by Minnesota on Sunday.
   
 The 32-year-old Chacin could provide depth as left-hander Cole Hamels recovers from left triceps tendinitis. Hamels won't be ready for Friday's season opener at the Mets.
   
 Chacin was a combined 3-12 with a 6.01 ERA with the Brewers and Red Sox last season. For his career, he has a 77-87 record and 4.03 ERA.
   
 NORRIS RETURNS
   
 Detroit Tigers left-hander Daniel Norris returned to camp Tuesday after testing positive for the coronavirus last month.
   
 Norris threw a bullpen session on Tuesday and is scheduled to pitch a simulated game on Thursday.
   
 Norris said he was tested while still in Florida but didn't receive his positive result until he arrived in Detroit for the start of camp.
   
 He said he was taking precautions while in Florida.
   
 "It was crazy down there. Everything was like open and semi-normal, but I wasn't partaking in all that," he said. "I just kind of figured I was doing enough to not get it."
   
 Norris said his symptoms didn't seem major at first -- he woke up sweating a bit and achy -- but in retrospect, he realized those symptoms may have been more significant.
   
 "The heavy symptoms only lasted a few days," Norris said. "A few days after that test, I was like, 'I feel like 100 percent.'"
   
 He said he sent out a message to teammates telling them not to take the virus lightly.
   
 RED SOX TRADE
   
 The Boston Red Sox acquired right-hander Dylan Covey from the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday.
   
 He has been added to the club player pool. Left-hander Bobby Poyner was removed from the pool but remains in the organization.
   
 The 28-year-old Covey has made 63 appearances with 45 starts in a three-year career with the Chicago White Sox. He is 6-29 with a 6.54 ERA.
   
 OPENING DAY FILL-IN
   
 Left-hander Tommy Milone will start on opening day for the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night in Boston.
   
 Manager Brandon Hyde made the announcement Tuesday before the Orioles closed out their brief exhibition schedule in Washington.
   
 John Means was originally selected to start the opener for Baltimore, but the 2019 All-Star lefty has a sore arm and will be held back in the rotation.
   
 The 33-year-old Milone signed as a non-roster invitee in mid-February. He was 4-10 with a 4.76 ERA with Seattle last season.
   
 IN THE BOOTH
   
 Astros television play-by-play announcer Todd Kalas will miss the start of the season after testing positive for the coronavirus. Kalas is asymptomatic but is quarantining as part of MLB's health and safety protocols.
   
 Kevin Eschenfelder will fill in for Kalas until he can return.
   
 The Braves are also without one of their announcers after former Atlanta outfielder Jeff Francoeur also tested positive for the virus. Francoeur said on Twitter he is asymptomatic.
   
 Francoeur's 12-year career as a player from 2005-16 included five seasons with the Braves.
   
 UNDER THE ROOF
   
 The Texas Rangers' new ballpark with a retractable roof didn't play too big for the Colorado Rockies, though it was only an exhibition game.
   
 Nolan Aranado and David Dahl hit two-run homers, and Daniel Murphy hit a solo shot, all in five innings off Rangers starter Kyle Gibson, as the Rockies won 5-1. Colorado was the first visiting team to play in Globe Life Field, and will also be there for the regular season opener Friday night.
   
 As will be the case for most of the hot Texas summer nights, the roof was closed.

Il terzo matrimonio di Patty Pravo si celebrò nel 1976 a Bali dove Patty Pravo si unì con Paul Jeffery, chitarrista inglese. Nel 1978 sposò in California il bassista statunitense Paul Martinez, e anche queste nozze non sono trascritte. Ricordate Pensiero Stupendo, il magnifico brano dell'ex ragazza del Piper del gennaio del 1978? Una storia sensuale e trasgressiva che parlava di un rapporto a tre. Patty Pravo, Paul Jeffery e Paul Martinez in quegli anni ebbero una situazione simile, fu la stessa cantante a raccontarlo a Candida Morvillo per il Corriere della Sera. " _Lavoravo con Vangelis all'album Tanto, entro nel suo studio e vedo un bellissimo ragazzo che suona il basso, Paul Martinez_ \- raccontò Patty Pravo - _Poi un altro, bellissimo, che suona la chitarra, Paul Jeffrey. Amarci in tre fu naturale. Abbiamo anche abitato insieme a Roma_ ". Il matrimonio con Paul Jeffrey fu un errore, i musicisti avveno lo stesso nome di battesimo e da questo nacque un equivoco molto divertente: " _Partivo per Bali di notte, squilla il telefono. 'Sono Paul'. Pensavo fosse Martinez e gli dico di partire con me. Invece, si presenta Jeffrey vestito di bianco, con la valigia. Però a Bali stemmo bene e ci sposammo_ ". Le nozze non erano valide. " _Però sono vere quelle con Martinez_ ", precisò la cantante.

Johnston's 20-foot (6.09-metre) bass boat, equipped with a 250 horsepower engine, can not only cover water but also handle whatever Mother Nature throws at it. But Johnston must also take weather into consideration when figuring how much time he needs to reach the weigh station on time.
 Johnston comes by his fishing passion honestly. There's are numerous lakes around Peterborough that offer top-notch fishing for a variety of species. Not surprisingly, many host tournaments.
 "My dad was into competitive tournaments and I've been in a boat since I could walk," Johnston said. "I fished my first tournament when I was 11 years old and ended up winning it with my dad and I've been hooked on it ever since.
 "When you're paying US$4,500 to get into a tournament, there's a lot on the line . . . a lot of stress but I wouldn't have it any other way when it comes to fishing."
 When on the water, Johnston and his brother are competitors and rivals. But afterwards, they'll get together to talk about the day that was and what might lie ahead.
 "We try to keep separate spots but we compare notes," Johnson said. "If I'm catching them in 35 feet of water I'll tell him to look at that.
 "I want to beat him, for sure, for money and bragging rights. But if I don't win I'd like to see him win."
 The Johnstons are also close with the other Canadian on tour, Jeff Gustafson of Keewatin, Ont. In fact, the three sometimes travel together.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly impacted the Bassmaster Elite series. Competitors are tested prior to each event and must complete daily health screenings.
 In past years, anglers would share their boats with a tournament marshals but now ride alone. And when catches are weighed, only one competitor waits at each water tank with his fish while others remain in their boats.
 Everyone at the weigh-station must wear a mash and exercise proper social distancing. Fans are no longer permitted to watch.
 But those measures haven't negatively impacted the goodwill and comradery among competitors.
 "We keep our distance," Johnston said. "But we're all here and hanging out.
 "It (pandemic) has thrown a curve into things but we're back fishing, all is good and everyone is happy."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 23, 2020.

Surprise, Swifties! Taylor Swift just announced a brand new surprise album, _Folklore_ , and it already looks so different than her previous era, _Lover_.
 Taylor announced the big news on her social media with a note on how it all came together, along with one of the covers for the album.
 "Most of the things I had planned this summer didn't end up happening, but there is something I hadn't planned on that DID happen. And that thing is my 8th studio album, folklore. Surprise 🤗Tonight at midnight I'll be releasing my entire brand new album of songs I've poured all of my whims, dreams, fears, and musings into," she wrote on Instagram.
 "I wrote and recorded this music in isolation but got to collaborate with some musical heroes of mine; @aarondessner (who has co-written or produced 11 of the 16 songs), @boniver (who co-wrote and was kind enough to sing on one with me), William Bowery (who co-wrote two with me) and @jackantonoff (who is basically musical family at this point). Engineered by Laura Sisk and Jon Low, mixed by Serban Ghenea & Jon Low."
 "The album photos were shot by the amazing @bethgarrabrant. Before this year I probably would've overthought when to release this music at the 'perfect' time, but the times we're living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed," she continued. "My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world. That's the side of uncertainty I can get on board with. Love you guys so much ♥️"

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the gold smuggling case on Thursday grilled Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's former principal secretary M Sivasankar. He was suspended from service last week after his alleged link with one of the accused in the case Swapna Suresh surfaced.
 He was interrogated by the Customs department for nine hours on July 14. He was instrumental in getting a key post for Suresh in Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT department. She allegedly used her proximity with the powerful principal secretary to dabble in corridors of power.
 There are reports that he arranged a flat just outside the secretariat for the husband of Swapna Suresh and another accused PS Sarith. The accused had later used this flat for their smuggling activities. Sivasankar had earlier told the Customs that he arranged this over friendship and he did not know about their illegal activities. A senior IAS officer, he was the CM's blue-eyed boy and was instrumental in bringing many IT and social projects to the state.
 In another development, the NIA has sought the CCTV footage of the state secretariat and sent a letter to chief secretary Biswas Mehta in this regard. Earlier, when customs sought this, his office had told them that the cameras developed snags during lightening in May. The NIA has also sought details of the service provider.
   
   
 When asked about this, the CM did not give a direct reply. "Let the NIA carry out its investigation. Its probe is going in the right direction. Why do you want to jump the gun," he retorted. But the opposition has stepped up pressure on him. "The probe has reached the office of the CM. He has no moral responsibility to remain in power," said BJP state president K Surendran. Congress state chief Mullappally Ramachandran also sought his resignation.
 The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5 when PS Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate in the state capital, was arrested when he went to receive a consignment in the name of an official of the consulate. Later, 30 kg of gold was retrieved from the consignment. Five days later, Swapna Suresh, a senior IT official and her friend Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru. Later the case was handed over to the NIA.
 The Customs department has deferred the transfer of key officials who are investigating the gold smuggling case following an outrage. The Union Home Ministry has also expressed serious reservations over the issue saying such a controversy should have been avoided when the investigation was going in the right track, a senior official familiar with the development said.
 The sudden transfer of six superintendents and two inspectors attached with Kochi unit of the Customs who are part of the ongoing investigation was issued by Mohammad Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, late on Wednesday. After the issue triggered a controversy the Customs department made it clear that it was a routine transfer and it had been deferred for the time being.

New Delhi:
 The long-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, which visualises a decongested and pedestrianised heritage market along the 1.5-km road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, will be thrown open to the public in the first week of November, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said after inspecting the site on Thursday.
 The project's aim is to have a pedestrian-friendly stretch that is devoid of the clutter caused by electrical and telephone wires in the skyline and noisy vehicles on the road.
 "The heart of Chandni Chowk or its main area is getting a complete makeover. It is a historical place. We will bring back the historical glory of this area by beautifying it in every way possible. This 1.5-km stretch will be a non- motorised vehicle (NMV) area from 9am to 9pm," Kejriwal told reporters.
 Kejriwal hoped the area will attract tourists from across the world. "We hope the place will be opened by the first week of November. It was supposed to start in May but the process was delayed due to the coronavirus," he said.
 Stating that the project has seen a cost escalation of around Rs 25-30 crore, he said, "The delay owing to the pandemic has now increased the estimated total project cost to Rs 90 crore."
 Work on the project started in December 2018 and was scheduled to be done by March 2020. The deadline was pushed to May 31 due to an embargo imposed by the National Green Tribunal on construction to control pollution.
 The coronavirus disease and the shortage of labour that stemmed out of the nationwide lockdown forced the authorities to further postpone it to the end of October .
 Garima Gupta, managing director of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), said major works such as laying underground electricity and water lines and constructing a stormwater drain were 95% complete and trials on energising these would begin.
 "Now mostly superficial works are left such as covering the roads and beautifying them. A major time-consuming work that will soon begin is laying granite slabs. Granite is very delicate and often breaks if not handled carefully. Footpaths and benches have to be built and poles need to be installed with signage," she said.
 Asked if the CM issued any directions, Gupta said, "Not really. The CM just wanted to take stock of the project."
 Gupta said the 1.5km stretch has been divided into four parts -- 1) Red Fort to Fountain Chowk or Gurudwara Sisganj; 2) Fountain Chowk or Gurudwara Sisganj to Town Hall; 3) Town Hall to Ballimaran; 4) Ballimaran to Fatehpuri Masjid. The entire stretch will be ready by October-end.
 "We have created five zones for works to continue simultaneously. Zone 1 and 2 are the footpaths, 3 and 4 are the carriageways and 5 is the central verge," Gupta said.
 Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, who interacted with Kejriwal during his inspection on Thursday, said the government should also focus on maintenance of the beautified area.
 "I gave the chief minister a copy of the heritage corridors built in Amritsar and requested the government's help in two areas -- maintenance of the redeveloped stretch and redeveloping the facade of old buildings. Kejriwal said a lot of onus lies on traders and residents too and we said we will fully cooperate and keep the beauty intact," he said.
 To this, the SRDC MD said upgrading the facades is part of the second phase. "Once this first phase is over, we will take up facade redevelopment. After the second phase, we will redevelop the Jama Masjid precincts," Gupta said.
 Dheeraj Pabbi, a resident, however, said social distancing norms went for a toss during the chief minister's visit. "It will be good for our children once this is ready. But, today no social distancing rules were followed," he said.

A letter shot off by a State bureaucrat has stirred a debate over the legal validity of the off-campus centre of the Bengaluru-based Jain (deemed-to-be) University functioning in Kochi since 2018.
 Following the University Grants Commission’s grant of graded autonomy in 2018, the centre admitted students the next year. The UGC, however, in a letter to the Higher Education Department in July 2019 said it had not granted approval to the university to establish the off-campus centre. It was asked to discontinue courses in Kochi.
 The UGC letter was in response to the department seeking clarification over the status of the off-campus centre and the Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth, Kochi. The government cautioned students over the validity of courses offered by the university.
 The issue reared its head again when the Higher Education Department wrote to UGC Chairman D.P. Singh on June 20 seeking action against the institution that ‘functioned without government approval.’
 Usha Titus, Principal Secretary, Higher Education, said the government had received complaints regarding non-compliance with the UGC’s directive. “As far as we understand, the off-campus centre is illegal. It remains so until the UGC informs the State of having sanctioned its operations,” she said adding that the government had not issued no-objection certificate for its functioning. The government is yet to receive the UGC’s response to the letter.
 ## University’s version
 However, the university maintained it had been functioning in line with the regulations laid down by the UGC. “We have also obtained approval for the Kochi campus in line with the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019. We do not require the State government’s concurrence as we function under the regulations of by the Centre and the UGC,” J. Letha, Pro Vice Chancellor of the university’s Kochi centre, said.
 Dr. Letha said a UGC panel had inspected the premises in December 2019. The UGC met in May to discuss a compliance report submitted by the university and recommended its approval. The first batch of 1,000 students admitted in 2019, would have no difficulties in establishing the validity of their certificates, she said.

New Delhi: Five months after the Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who have joined the Indian Army through Short Service Commission (SSC), are entitled to a permanent commission, the defence ministry on Thursday issued a formal sanction letter in this regard. The order will pave the way for "empowering women officers to shoulder larger roles in the organisation", an army spokesperson said.
 "In anticipation, the Army Headquarters had set in motion a series of preparatory actions for conduct of the Permanent Commission Selection Board for affected women officers," the army said in statement. The board will be scheduled as soon as the SSC women officers exercise their option and complete the requisite documentation. The statement said the army is committed to providing equal opportunities to all personnel including women officers to serve the country.
 The Supreme Court in February ruled that women should be considered for command roles and that all women officers are entitled to permanent commission. It asked the army to give them permanent commission within three months in a major boost to gender parity.
 The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the Supreme Court's verdict after it moved an application before the apex court seeking the extension of the deadline by another six months citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread from March 25.
 The army, in May, made the Battle Physical Efficiency Test (BPET) mandatory for all women officers including those commissioned before 2009 and over the age of 35 (these officers were previously exempt). In March, it made a junior command course at Army War College, Mhow mandatory for women officers. There are around 600 women officers eligible for permanent commission, and a third of them are over the age of 40. Both moves have come in for criticism for women officers who have pointed to their timing -- after the SC's verdict.
 The Supreme Court's judgment was hailed for creating a new equality paradigm in the armed forces. It upheld a 2010 Delhi high court verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through SSC, are entitled to permanent commission even if they have more than 14 years of service. It also held that there cannot be an "absolute bar" on women officers being considered for command appointments, paving the way for their elevation to such roles. The case before the Supreme Court was only about permanent commission and command roles in the army's non-combat streams.
 The defence ministry's sanction specifies grant of permanent commission to SSC women officers in 10 streams--Army Air Defence, Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps, and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General and Army Educational Corps.
 Advocate Aishwarya Bhati, who represented women officers in the Supreme Court, said it was wonderful to finally see the defence ministry's sanction. "I am elated," said Bhati.
 Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), who is from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the 1990s, said the government should be lauded over the defence ministry's move. "As they say 'a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.' The government needs to be lauded for this leap. The equity has been achieved. However, equality still remains a goal to strive for," said Joshi. She said the army should allow women in combat roles too.
 The Supreme Court in February ruled the army's SSC women officers are entitled to permanent commission and they have to be considered for it irrespective of their service length. It held the Centre's policy of restricting the permanent commission to SSC women officers with less than 14-year service as violative of the right to equality.
 The judgement was delivered on defence ministry's petition challenging the 2010 Delhi high court verdict that ruled that SSC women officers in the army and IAF should be granted permanent commission on par with male SSC officers.
 The Centre issued a notification in February 2019 granting permanent commission to SSC officers of the army. However, as per its proposal, only SSC women officers with up to 14 years of service were to be considered.

Liman and Cruise have made multiple movies together: the true-life drug runner tale _American Made_ and the sci-fi modern classic _Edge of Tomorrow_. But interestingly, Liman has a reputation for difficult shoots and seems to relish changing things on the fly. That approach doesn't seem like a great fit in this case, where the simple act of shooting the movie literally involves life and death stakes and the margin of error is razor-thin. But the other important thing to note about Liman is that despite those horror stories about his sets, he often ends up making terrific, thrilling films which bear no visible proof of any behind-the-scenes turbulence. Here's hoping everything goes smoothly for this one, since, as Variety also notes, Cruise might be well over 60 years old by the time he straps into that rocket and heads into the stars.

PSG are Ligue 1 champions and, with a League Cup final versus Olympique Lyonnais and a Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta coming up, victory on Friday would keep Thomas Tuchel's side in contention for an unprecedented quadruple.
 "This will be our first official match since March. I have the feeling that we are prepared for this final as best as possible," Tuchel told a news conference on Thursday. "The best thing to prepare for big challenges is to win titles."
 PSG showed little rust preparing for their return to action, scoring 20 goals and conceding none in friendlies against Le Havre, Waasland-Beveren and Celtic, with their prolific strike partnership of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe looking in fine form.
 The French champions, who have won the French Cup a record 12 times, have 16 wins in their last 18 games against St Etienne in all competitions which will bolster their confidence.

Gurugram The number of samples awaiting confirmatory tests for Covid-19 infection in the district has been reduced by 55% over the past five days, said officials of the district health department. Since July 1, the number of samples has incrementally built up due to a paucity of equipment and logistical challenges in reporting the test results. However, with the addition of the new generation of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, the backlog of pending samples is gradually being cleared, with the number of pending samples down to 614 from 1,358 on Saturday. This backlog too would be cleared soon, said health officials. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that the health department has begun using three new RT-PCR kits. Each test kit has a cycle time of about three hours, while the labs can run two to three cycles daily. "We can test up to 90 samples at a time using the new test kits, which can produce results in about three hours. This has allowed us to test 600 new samples each day, and, more importantly, report the results sooner. Traditionally, RT-PCR can take at least 12 hours to produce a confirmatory result," Yadav said. RT-PCR tests are considered to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing and are used to determine the amount of viral RNA in a sample. Health department officials, however, did not provide details on the make, sensitivity or specificity of the new RNA test kits. "I am unable to recall these details at the moment. However, the new test kits have been validated and provided to us by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)," said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme's (IDSP) district surveillance officer in Gurugram.Sharma added that there are only about 44 samples collected prior to July 23 whose test results are awaited. "Of the current lot of 614 pending samples, almost 570 were collected on July 23 itself, and their results will be received by late in the night, and shared in the next day's (Friday) bulletin," Sharma said, emphasizing that the new kits have significantly improved the turnaround time in reporting results. From the earlier turnaround time of nearly 12 hours, the new test kits are being able to provide results in three hours. A doctor with the IDSP in Gurugram, seeking anonymity, explained that the introduction of rapid antigen detection tests in the city earlier this month had necessitated an upgrade in health department's RT-PCR testing capacity. "About 10% of the antigen test samples are being retested via RT-PCR. As per the norms, in antigen testing, a positive test is always a true positive, while a negative test requires a follow-up test, via the RT-PCR method, especially if a patient is showing symptoms. This adds to the RT-PCR's testing load by anything between 80 to 100 samples per day, which is why the backlog had initially built up." Officials said that, on an average, about 1,500 to 1,700 samples are being tested in the district everyday, of which rapid antigen tests make up about two third of the total number of tests. These tests are being conducted in the large outbreak regions and containment zones. The health department's target in the coming weeks is to increase this capacity to at least 2,000 tests per day, if not more. A total of 74,720 tests have been carried out in Gurugram so far (including both anitgen and RT-PCR tests). While it took three and a half months for the health department to carry out the first 50,000 tests (which it achieved on July 10), the subsequent 24,000 odd tests have been carried out in less than two weeks.

“We want to let people know they can still vote from the comfort and safety of their own homes,” Wellhausen stated, adding, “and we had wonderful turnout from that the last time.”
 The supervisors questioned how much it might cost to mail the requests and when they could go out. Wellhausen explained it had cost $4,000-$5,000 to mail the absentee ballot requests for the primary election in June, so that was the expected cost this time. She said if the supervisors approved the mailing, her office could get started working on them and then mail them out around Aug. 1.
 Wellhausen clarified that this was absentee ballot requests they were mailing out, not ballots. These forms could be filled out and sent back by county residents to request the absentee ballots, which could not be mailed out before Oct. 5.
 Page County Public Health Administrator Jessica Erdman advised the board there was not much new to discuss regarding COVID-19. There have been 22 cases in the county, and two cases are still active. When asked, she agreed the issue looked like it would continue long-term, and the county should continue arrangements for door monitoring and other safety measures.
 When asked how door monitoring was working out and how busy it had been, Angie Dow said when her office had been acting as the door monitor they were seeing 40 to 60 people per day, and it was her understanding from the current door monitor that the number was staying around 60 people. The supervisors will continue to monitor the situation weekly and adjust practices as needed.
 The supervisors discussed the five-year conservation farm lease last made with Hilger Farms to farm the county’s 14 acres by Rapp Park. That lease agreement was up and the board had been told by the state auditor a new lease was needed.
 The board noted the last time the lease had come up for bids, they had contacted all of the surrounding farmers and no one other than Hilger Farms was interested due to access issues. They debated whether they needed to contact all of the other farmers again, or could just renew the agreement with Hilger Farms if they were still interested.
 The Page County Conservation Board receives between $2,400 to $2,900 in income from this farm ground every year. The board approved contracting with Hilger Farms for another five years.
 Page County Treasurer Angie Dow and Attorney Carl Sonksen discussed the annual June 2020 tax sale, and whether to hold it this year. Currently, the county treasurer and county attorney are able to decide if the sale should be held for delinquent taxes. Recognizing the current state of the economy, Dow suggested the county should cancel the sale and not send out delinquent tax notices this year to give taxpayers more time to make payments. Dow said as of the July 13, $235,000 was outstanding in taxes, and she hoped to see about $100,000 of that come in within the next 10 days or so. It was suggested the treasurer and supervisors continue to monitor new rules or changing advice from the governor or attorney general about the situation.
