Those had been our 3 stipulations, and it went proper as much as the chairman, who I consider noticed the ultimate movie about that plant, and he stated sure. He’s a maverick, he believes in transparency. Now, in a Chinese industry, as you'll be able to believe, it’s a privately owned industry. Once the chairman says sure, the solution is sure all of the method down the road. Even if other folks didn’t like it. Some of the vice presidents and HR other folks may now not have preferred that we had been there always.

For example, consider how often the parties exchange power in Congress and the presidency. Why do we elect a liberal like President Obama and then eight years later elect President Trump, who has been enacting and promoting the conservative agenda?

“(Complementary scoring) wasn’t there, and we do need to help him more,” Pirate coach Joe Dooley said of Gardner, the American Athletic Conference’s leading scorer. “Part of that is making layups in the first half and some free throws. To me, the free throw (misses) in the first half were almost energy sucking. ... That can be a little disheartening, and then obviously when the ball is clanging off the rim from 3, it doesn’t help.”
 Houston (16-4, 7-1) moved into sole possession of first place in the American. It ended the first half on a 12-1 run for a 33-21 cushion, then the Cougars’ lead stayed around 10-12 points for most of the rest of the way.
 The Pirates were 2-of-6 from the free throw line during the first 20 minutes. They finished 17-for-26.
 ECU’s final lead was 6-4. The closest it got to a tie after halftime was an eight-point deficit.
 Brandon Suggs’ 3-pointer made it 46-38 with 12:01 left, followed by a key 9-2 run by the Cougars for a 55-40 advantage. The triple was a rare outside make for the Pirates, who finished 4-of-23 on 3-pointers.
 “You have to make shots, at the end of the day,” Gardner said. “It happens that quick. Last game we were hot and this game cold, so you just have to be consistent. Credit to them because they are really long and they challenged shots and got after it.”
 ECU still was 43-43 rebounding with the Cougars, who are the top team in the nation in that regard and often use their length for putbacks and high- percentage shots.
