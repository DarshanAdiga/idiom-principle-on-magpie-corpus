But why opt to spend time and resources on a ‘3D’ audio presentation for what is essentially a ‘2D’ game? Well, first off _Ori and the Will of the Wisps_ may have most of the gameplay action in 2D, but it still has a lot of depth within the world. It has so much detail and dimensionality in its environments that alludes to a ‘there’ beyond the playable area, we wanted the audio to add to that sense of space and immersion.

Sally’s passion in life was her only daughter, Elvis, taking pictures and party planning... not necessarily in that order. She loved bringing people together and making sure every last detail was perfect.


  Later in life, she walked into Bedford’s First Christian Church and was active in every way possible, serving on committees, being a Deacon, visiting the homebound and of course, cooking up everyone’s favorite sweet potato casserole for every dinner, whether it was Easter, Christmas or July 4.


  She was a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a momma, a mother-in-law and a gramma, as well as dearest friend to so many!


  She will be loved and missed forever, ‘til we meet again.


  Visitation will be from 4-8 p.m. on Thursday at Ferguson-Lee Chapel of Thorne-George Family Funeral Homes.


  Funeral services will be 10 a.m. on Friday at the funeral home with Pastor Judi Early officiating. Burial to follow at Pinhook Cemetery.

BERLIN (AP) — German business confidence has risen for the second consecutive month, a closely watched survey showed Wednesday. The result was slightly better than economists' expectations.


  The Ifo institute said its monthly confidence index rose to 86.2 points in June from 79.7 in May. Economists had forecast an increase to 85. Managers' assessment of both their current situation and, in particular, the outlook for the next six months brightened.


  The Ifo said it was the strongest monthly increase it has ever recorded and “German business sees light at the end of the tunnel.”


  The German economy, Europe's biggest, went into a recession in the first quarter that is expected to deepen in the current quarter. A panel of economic experts that advises the government said Tuesday that output won’t completely bounce back to pre-virus levels until 2022 after a sharp plunge of 6.5% this year.


  However, the government is seeking to boost the economy with a 130 billion- euro ($147 billion) stimulus package, including a six-month cut in value-added tax that takes effect next week.


  Germany started loosening restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic in late April and that process has gathered pace since, despite some concern over local outbreaks.


  The Ifo index is based on monthly responses from managers at about 9,000 companies.

  _"Evolu ţia acestui tip de fals la nivelul anului 2014 a fost una spectaculoasă, fiind pentru prima dată in istoria falsului de monedă din Romania cand aceasta era identificată in circuitul financiar, cu precădere in centrele de procesare de numerar, ceea ce indepărta practic momentul punerii in circulaţie de momentul identificării bancnotei.

Bosch Ltd., the Indian unit of the world’s largest auto-parts supplier, plans to join its parent, Robert Bosch GmbH in cutting jobs as the South Asian nation witnesses one of its worst auto sales slowdowns in decades.
 The German company will cut “a couple of thousand" jobs in India in the next four years, India Managing Director Soumitra Bhattacharya said. About 10% of 3,700 white-collar jobs and a slightly higher percentage of 6,300 blue-collar jobs will be cut, he added in an interview in Bangalore on Dec. 30.
 “There is a transformation happening across the industry," Bhattacharya said. “We looked at that as an opportunity to transform the company even before the downturn started."
 Carmakers across the world will shed 80,000 jobs in the coming years amid shrinking demand. That will hit sales at autopart makers. In India, Bosch expects auto sales to only recover in the next two-three years after plummeting in 2019 because of regulatory changes, threat of electrification, a liquidity crunch and an economic slowdown.
 Still, the German component maker sees the demand for internal combustion engine vehicles leading growth in the auto industry in India. Both ICE and electric powertrains will coexist for a long time, Bhattacharya said. He forecast that 80% of the vehicles will run on ICE the rest on electric by 2030 in the nation.
 Bosch India’s profit fell 66% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from a year earlier. Its share price dropped 22% last year.
 India’s auto sector is going through a cyclical and structural changes because of electrification, technological shift and the advent of shared mobility, Bhattacharya said.

Is there still room for both linear and sandbox games? Of course! You don’t have to pick one or the other. That’s the greatest thing about being a gamer in 2020. There’s so much more choice, and so much more… well, _everything_. More consoles. More developers. More genres. More games – so, _so_ many more games. And while there’s no doubt 60-hour sagas offer the best value for money, especially for those able to wring out every last side mission and collectible, there’s a part of me that will always favour the punchier, streamlined adventure of a linear game. At least I’m able to finish those ones.

My degree was in mathematics and I initially spent three years in a housing company interrogating various databases. It was actually quite interesting, but it wasn’t my passion. When I decided that I wanted to build a career in games, it took a lot of applications to even get an interview, but I was determined to find a role in a mobile games company. When I got to an interview my degree and work experience was useful – but it was undoubtedly my passion and knowledge of mobile games that sealed the deal. Back then I was all over _DragonVale, Dungeon Raid, Angry Birds_ and _Candy Crush_ and I think the people interviewing me realised I was playing more mobile games than most people in that studio.
