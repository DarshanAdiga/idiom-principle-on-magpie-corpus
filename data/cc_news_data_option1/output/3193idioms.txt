What we've seen of Intel Xe for gaming so far has been in the form of its Xe- LP ('low power') GPU. The Intel DG1 graphics card that first excited us (and that might actually never hit the market in a discrete form) - the company's first discrete graphics card since its circa 2010 cancelled Larrabee project - is made from this Xe-LP architecture, and we've already seen that Xe-LP can run Battlefield 5 on high settings.

"It is unconstitutional for Governor Newsom and the State of California to discriminate against churches by treating them less favorably than other organizations and activities that are not protected by the First Amendment … This is especially the case when the government has given free rein to protestors, and is not similarly restricting marijuana dispensaries, large retail outlets and factories, and abortion providers," noted LiMandri.

With all the expectation surrounding upcoming Nvidia Ampere and AMD Navi 2X graphics cards, you could be forgiven for forgetting all about Intel Xe. The company's latest graphics architecture has been in the works for a while now and has gained the spotlight thanks to its promise of a third discrete graphics vendor to potentially rival both Nvidia and AMD in the gaming space. Well, now it looks like Xe might get hardware ray tracing, too.

Now is the perfect time to get in the ray tracing game, too. Perhaps if Xe gaming GPUs actually hit the market a couple of years ago they could have got away with no ray tracing - AMD's current RDNA GPU generation doesn't have hardware-accelerated ray tracing, after all. But with next-gen consoles supporting it, Nvidia's upcoming RTX 30-series GPUs being expected to dramatically increase ray tracing performance, and AMD's upcoming Big Navi and Navi 2X GPUs being expected to support the technology, it makes sense that Intel's upcoming gaming GPUs should also support it.

In many cases, using the money you have instead of borrowing or raising is a great approach. In fact, some entrepreneurs continue to bootstrap until their business is profitable. This can be beneficial because it means you won't have extensive loans and monthly payments that can weigh you down, and investing some of your own money will usually make investors and lenders more willing to partner with you down the line.
