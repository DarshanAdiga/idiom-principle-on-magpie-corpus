That's because every quarter policymakers have to give individual forecasts for economic growth, the unemployment rate, inflation and interest rates for the end of the year in progress as well as for the next two or three years and the longer term.
 Next week's projections will give insight into whether any policymakers foresee a recession, and if so, how deep and how long it might be. The range of forecasts, which are anonymous, will offer clues on how divided policymakers are.
 "I think the most important thing will be the dispersion of views," said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. "Is this a Fed where there is broad agreement?"
 The central bank slashed interest rates by half a percentage point to a target range of between 1per cent and 1.25per cent in an emergency move just over a week ago as fears about the prospect of a global recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic caused stock markets to drop sharply.

The price you pay when you lose a beloved animal is so steep that every time I lose one, I always say, “Never again.”
 I’ve written about this topic before, but after following the adventures of a friend of mine’s dog on Facebook for a number of years, the news of the pup’s passing brought a tear and the need for an homage.
 When you lose a pet, the same thing happens repeatedly as time passes. The pain fades as their physical presence becomes part of the past, but they leave behind joy, and memories of complete dedication and unquestioned love.
 I’ve often said that it’s easier to lose some people than it is a pet. People have questioned my sanity for making that comment. But, that’s OK. Maybe they’re right.
 Maybe giving so much of my heart and soul to an animal is nuts. Honestly, I’ve trusted a dog or a cat with my deepest feelings far more often than people.
 I believe that one of the best gifts God gives each of us is the opportunity to welcome a pet into our family. There are those who never do — often due to allergies, but sometimes by choice. I respect their right to choose not to have a pet, but I so wish that I could help them see the pure joy they are missing. The pure joy that only a pet can give.
 A pet never questions your motives. They’re supportive when you’ve made a mistake or poor choices. A pet will give you a hug — no questions asked.
 Most importantly, a pet doesn’t pass judgment or say, “I told you so.”
 A number of years ago, a friend with whom I attended high school stopped at a Dairy Queen in Buffalo, Texas. He left with a food order and a black and white collie mix.
 Little did the pup know that he was embarking on a life which any other dog — or human for that matter — would be envious.
 My high school buddy is a writer, photographer, and world traveler. For the next decade, Daniel and his new adopted friend ‘Kirby’, made their way to wherever their Airstream took them.
 I always enjoyed the photos of Kirby standing on a beach, looking intently at something or running from a field toward Daniel and his camera.
 When Daniel posted that Kirby had passed, all of the memories of losing my pets came flooding back. And I heard the words I had always said — “Never again.”
 But I remembered the joy, love, and companionship that always outweighed the loss. It’s why after losing a number of pets over the years, my wife and I eventually give our hearts to other companions. Currently, we have a cat named “Cola” and a peacock named “Fred.”
 The answer to the question is, “No,” the cost of losing a pet isn’t too much. If anything, we owe the animal a debt of gratitude when they leave us.
 I forget who said this, but it’s true: An animal is just part of our life, but we are all of theirs.
 I’m sorry, Daniel. I know it hurts. I also know Kirby loved you. He would have told you how much if he could talk. But I’m guessing he didn’t have to. You always knew.

MIAMI (AP) — Florida has never been known as a place of stability, especially in its politics.And yet stability is what has been on the minds of many Democrats in the state who say they'll vote for former Vice President Joe Biden in Tuesday's presidential primary election instead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders."I like some of Sanders' ideas, but he's a little too extreme for me," said Jeanne Hilburn, a 76-year-old retired teacher who lives in the suburbs of Tampa. "A lot of Democrats are like me — we want stability."As the race for the Democratic nomination enters a penultimate phase, with Sanders' campaign on the brink of collapse and Biden's ascendant, attention is turning to places like Florida, which is holding its primary on Tuesday along with Ohio, Illinois and Arizona. Florida has 219 delegates, the biggest prize of next week's election.Few places hold the electoral cachet of Florida, which has been among the most coveted swing states in the last three decades, including during the contentious, chaotic recount of 2000. It is a vital state for President Donald Trump, who would have almost no path to reelection without it.Biden's advisers are banking on a decisive Florida victory that sends a clear message that he is much better positioned to win the state and deny Trump a second term.In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton here by 1.2 percentage points."Florida, as always, is pivotal in the outcome," said Nikki Fried, who is the state's agriculture commissioner and top elected Democrat and who endorsed Biden. "We are the ultimate swing state."Sanders' support in Florida has always been tenuous. In the 2016 primary, he lost to Clinton by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. This year, Sanders angered a potentially large voting bloc — Cuban Americans — by praising Fidel Castro for implementing a literacy program in the communist nation."There is nothing positive you can say about the conditions in Cuba. If he doesn't understand that, it is hard to conceive that he will get any votes," said Xavier Suarez, who was the first Cuban-born mayor of Miami and is now running as an independent in the county mayoral race. "It's gonna be a massacre."That leaves many Florida Democrats looking beyond the primary to November. Several groups have banded together to register people to vote and mobilize for November.One of the four groups, Organizing Together 2020, is led by Fried. It will hire employees, register voters, train volunteers and then turn everything over to the party after the July convention. Another of the groups is For Our Future, a super PAC that is made up largely of Mike Bloomberg's campaign apparatus.A strong turnout in the Florida primary could give hope to Democrats, though it would be difficult to draw any conclusions for November given the state's high number of independents. And, to be sure, the coronavirus outbreak could keep some voters away from the polls and muffle any message from the turnout.Democrats know it will be a challenge to sway voters here. About 3.6 million of the state's 13.6 million voters are registered independents, which means they can't vote in Tuesday's primary but are eligible to cast ballots in the general election."Florida is an interesting state. Depending on where you're at, we can be very conservative, or we can be very progressive," said St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, a Democrat. "We also have a strong moderate and independent streak. Biden, I think he'll do well here with Democrats and independents. And with Republicans who are looking for an alternative to President Trump."Ashley Walker, of Organizing Together, said a priority is grassroots door-knocking in counties that were close in 2016, like Pinellas, home to St. Petersburg, which Trump won by 5,500 votes, and in Pasco, a suburban county just north of Tampa where voters moved to Republican candidates in the 2018 Senate and gubernatorial races.Walker says the aim is to siphon off votes there."The margins matter. We're probably not going to win Pasco County, but we're going to need to close the margins so we lose less badly," she said. "And in those counties that go back-and-forth between red and blue, like Pinellas, it's especially important to get organized early. To build relationships early."Similarly, Biden's supporters have been paying visits to Spanish-language TV shows and broadening "diaspora outreach" efforts in South Florida. John Kerry, the former secretary of state and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, spoke about Latin America policy on behalf of Biden's campaign at a restaurant in Doral, the hub of Venezuelan exiles."We feel good about where we are in the state, but we are not taking anything for granted," said Carmen Torres, of Florida Hispanics for Biden.Democrats don't have a lock on the Latino vote in Florida, particularly among the nearly 2 million residents who are originally from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, where authoritarian socialist regimes have soured many exiles toward any left- leaning politicians.A third of Cuban American midterm voters identify as Democrats, according to AP Vote Cast, a wide-ranging survey of the elecotrate. But the survey said a majority, 56%, of Cuban American midterm voters expressed approval of the way Trump was handling his job as president.Daisy Baez, a former Democratic state lawmaker, is leading a group called "Dominicanos con Biden" to rally her fellow Dominican Americans to support the former vice president. A similar effort to rally Venezuelans will roll out on Sunday."We wanted to address our message to a specific community," Baez said. "We needed to piece it down in smaller parts."As Sanders' chances diminish, Biden may also need to win over his challenger's fervent supporters if an endorsement follows. Some may not follow suit.Nick Mora, 24, a Florida International University Student, marched alongside 20 students on a recent afternoon on campus to persuade others to vote early for Sanders. Mora acknowledged Sanders' defeat earlier this week was disappointing but said they were not ready to give up yet."Let's just say Joe Biden does not have the same policy proposals as Bernie," Mora said. "I feel like the progressive movement is being pushed down, and there's not much we can do about it if we vote for Joe Biden, so we are still trying to fight till the end."___Lush reported from St. Petersburg, Fla.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

 At the conclusion of next week's meeting - if not before - the Fed is seen announcing a further reduction in borrowing costs by as much as three quarters of a percentage point, with financial markets predicting the Fed will be forced to cut to zero by April to boost the economy.
 DEEP UNCERTAINTY
 The breakneck speed with which the coronavirus outbreak has altered business and government decisions that could impact the U.S. economy, as well as deep uncertainty about how severe and long-lasting the effects will be, make the forecasts more difficult than usual. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump imposed sweeping restrictions on travel from Europe.
 "A situation like this, they don't have a basis. What kind of assumptions will condition the forecast?" said Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro. "You don't know exactly how it will play out."
 So far, the most-watched economic indicators have yet to deteriorate, but if the United States is forced to impose more severe measures to slow down the spread of the virus, that could quickly change. Fear can also play a large part in dampening consumer spending - the main engine of U.S. economic growth - if the public is too scared to go out.
 The virus is already reducing demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services.
 Economists expect policymakers to make cuts to their forecasts, but will be looking to see if they expect the impact on economic growth to be concentrated in the first half of the year with a rebound in the second half.
 Complicating matters further could be the recent hit to the U.S. energy sector, which is now a net exporter. Crude prices have plunged, a drop that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. That could cause a further downturn in business investment, which has been negative for three straight quarters.
 "Usually what would offset that are consumers," said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global. "I do expect they can't ignore that many parts of the United States are in shutdown mode."

As we chatted, Rodgers and Andrew spoke comfortably, like old friends. Both have been integral to Houston's music scene for some time and it's hard to believe they just met through this project. While building a new stage for Rudz, they built something else that's special, too.
 "I think that we just turned out to be a good pair working together," Andrew said. "I don't push my ego too forward on anybody. I mean, I've got strong opinions but Lelia's a businesswoman. I came in here and thought I'm not gonna bullshit somebody who's been doing this. I had to prove myself in conversations and prove that I cared and was someone she could trust."
 "I think I have a pretty good read on people. I tend to sort of give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm okay with that. It hasn't bitten me so hard that I've been like 'I'm never doing that again!'" Rodgers said." "She's completely into the whole music scene to the point of having a record company, doing posters and just talking with her - she's smart and articulate and really, really knowledgeable. She's smart and has done her homework and has synthesized it into a narrative she can share with somebody who doesn't have the technical expertise. I sort of had to wrap by head around it to green light it."
 "I came in here to do this because I wanted to do it," Andrew said, "and it's just been worth it to build this relationship."

But she mostly had lots of loose notes until she had a fortuitous lunch with Rachel Hulsey, a friend and fellow artist, and learned during that meal that Hulsey had a background in single-family home architecture. It wasn't long, she said, before she "Tom Sawyered" Hulsey into providing some missing design expertise to the project. She said her friend was happy to help.
 "She drafted up this really great looking plot that these guys understand," she said. "She was like a total game-changer, life saver, just came in and did it."
 Rodgers kept the work in-house with Mickey Wolf, who's managed all of Rudyard's recent renovation work, overseeing this project, with help from Charles Truwitt. They were literally running wood saws and pounding hammers while we discussed the build-out. They day we met was day three of a project which had to be complete in five days, before tonight's show.
 "We had to do this right in the middle of an active calendar, which was crazy," Andrew noted.
 The old stage was set in a corner of the spacious upstairs room, which, Rodgers said, was once apartment space long ago. The new stage is centered along the back wall of the room. Andrew said it is 16 feet wide and 14 feet deep, so there will be plenty of room for bands to create manic antics and memories for Rudyard's show-goers.
 "There's not another stage like this in Houston right now," Andrew said. "It's got that front wall, which sort of reminds me of the old downstairs stage at Fitzgerald's. There's a ramp on the right side for gear but also for handicap access, which this room has struggled with for a long time."
 Other amenities include a side stage door which leads to band gear storage space. Later, they plan to create a green room to help draw more touring acts to the space. Each end of the stage will boast panels and speakers and the room's camera system will be trained on center stage. Since 1997, wall dimmer switches controlled the stage lighting. The new system will include back lighting and new spotlights.
 "It's going to be completely different. There's an actual light board now, you can control it, set scenes, the whole thing," Andrew said. "I think every step of the way we were worried that Joe was gonna sink his nails in and we were gonna have to drag him down the road with us, but he showed up yesterday and he was like, 'I stayed up all night and I know everything about these lights now, let's go!'"

What are we to do? How much self-quarantine can theatergoers endure without a healthy dose of art to inoculate us against the slings and arrows of everyday life?
 We will see, I guess. Many theaters in Houston (Alley, Catastrophic, Stages, Miller Outdoor, Houston Ballet, Classical) have already postponed their current season until the end of March, if not April - God forbid! - but the panic has set in and there's no stopping it. The virus is haunting us. The Alley's new production of _1984_ opened this Wednesday, March 11, and played one performance before the management closed the theater. We expect other houses to announce postponements soon.
 When the lights of Broadway go dark, and NYC's august Metropolitan Opera and the city's most illustrious concert venue, Carnegie Hall, closes shop for the foreseeable future, what hope is there for Houston's arts and culture?
 What are our artists supposed to live on? Prior applause doesn't pay the rent. What about the stagehands, costumers, lighting designers, ushers...critics? (All right, maybe a few theaters wouldn't be so sad to see us reviewers take a respite for a while, but we're still worried about the state of the art.) And the audience - those wonderful people out there in the dark - let's not forget them. They pay the rent.
 And what's to become of the smaller theaters? Without income for even a month, they will struggle to break even. Some may fail. It will take months for their finances to come into the black. Usually, they live show by show, getting only enough money to pay for the next production. The prospect looks bleak.

The World Health Organization is considering changing the way it classifies and describes international epidemics, amid a protracted public debate over whether to call the outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic.Officials at the Geneva-based WHO who this week described it as a pandemic for the frst time - are reviewing how the health agency communicates its risk assessment of disease outbreaks in the future, said two people familiar with the discussions. They said that included use of the term pandemic as well as PHEIC, which stands for public health emergency of international concern. Among ideas that have been discussed is whether to use a more graded approach to capture different levels of severity, rather than binary terminology, the two people said. That would enable the WHO to dial up the severity of its messaging to prompt global cooperation on issues such as funding and drug development across the public health and scientific community, but without causing unnecessary public alarm.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has publicly signalled support for a more nuanced approach, saying the current system of declaring a public health emergency is too blunt. Its either red or green, Tedros said during a Jan. 29 conference with news media. I think we have to now revise that. You cannot have just yes or no. There could be some intermediate situation. He suggested a yellow stage that could be a warningserious enough but not really red.The agencys emergency committee on the new coronavirus, which is made up of independent experts, alluded to the internal discussions the following day. In a Jan. 30 statement following a meeting at which it declared a public health emergency, the panel said it recommended that the WHO continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between PHEIC or no PHEIC. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said that currently the decision on declaring a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, is binary. She said the WHOs emergency committee on coronavirus suggested, and the director general agreed, to meet to review whether the existing instrument is still fit for purpose.The discussion around the agencys messaging on epidemics comes as it seeks to coordinate the global fight against an outbreak of infection with the newly identified coronavirus, which emerged in December. Now known as COVID-19, it has spread from China to more than 100 countries, killing thousands of people with more expected to die. While many public health experts say the WHOs response to this epidemic has been timely and decisive, the agency has also drawn criticism from some commentators who say it has been too quick to heap praise on China a criticism Tedros has strongly rejected, saying Chinas drastic measures have slowed the virus spread and allowed other countries to prepare. The agency also came under intense media scrutiny in recent weeks as it refrained from calling the infectious diseases spread a pandemic, even as it took grip in scores of countries around the world.When the WHO did on Wednesday describe COVID-19 as a pandemic, Director General Tedros said the agency was concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity of coronavirus. While the characterisation doesnt trigger any formal change in what the agency does or it recommends countries do, some public health experts said it might prompt governments to move more swiftly to make interventions, such as banning or restricting public gatherings or travel. GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY Under the WHOs International Health Regulations, the agency can formally declare a PHEIC pronounced fake, or global health emergency, which it did with COVID-19 on Jan. 30. Such declarations are made when an epidemic meets two criteria The outbreak poses a risk to more than one country and it requires a coordinated international response. The formal designation triggers various moves, including calls for increased funding and resources, recommendations to countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross- border spread of disease and boosting public health measures.The WHO has declared PHEICs on five previous occasions, including the West Africa Ebola outbreak starting in 2014 and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak that spread from Brazil. In 2009, the WHO declared the outbreak of H1N1 flu a pandemic. That move later drew criticism from some governments that it triggered some countries to take expensive measures, including stockpiling and prescribing anti-viral drugs and undertaking mass vaccinations against a flu that ultimately turn out to be milder than originally thought. The then-director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, has defended her decision as the right call.How the WHO communicates around global epidemics was under review even before the COVID-19 outbreak began in December, according to the two people familiar with the discussions. According to one of those people, the discussion was prompted in part by last years outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which the WHO declared a PHEIC in July 2019. WHO officials wanted to sound an alarm and prompt a global response in terms of funding and vaccines, but there were questions among some officials at the WHO and member states about whether it was truly an international issue because the Ebola outbreak affected only Congo and neighbouring Uganda, the person said. They added that these questions focused discussion on whether a graded approach might be more appropriate.When COVID-19 began spreading beyond China, global health officials and experts looked to the WHO to declare a PHEIC. Even after it did so in late January, the agency faced repeated questions from international media on whether or not the outbreak was a pandemic. PANDEMIC CONTROLSome WHO chiefs have expressed concern that using the label pandemic might signal to governments and the public that the coronavirus outbreak had developed to a level where there was no longer action they could take to control its spread. That was a key part of the WHOs message when it did ultimately call the coronavirus as a pandemic. We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. This is the first pandemic that can be controlled, Tedros said in a tweet Wednesday.WHO officials and some global health experts said the medias focus on the word pandemic was an unwanted distraction for them because, unlike the PHEIC classification, it doesnt trigger specific responses within countries. There is an unhelpful alignment in peoples minds between this pandemic word and some sort of major shift in approach - but this is not the case, Mike Ryan, head of WHOs health emergencies programme, told reporters at a March 3 briefing for news media.A sign of the WHOs frustration was visible during a news conference this week one of around 30 hour-long briefings the WHO has held for international media since the COVID-19 outbreak began. A senior official who had been asked repeatedly by journalists about whether the disease constituted a pandemic gave a half-joking but tetchy response This is a word you love, right You just cant wait, can you Some specialists agree that the external focus on the label pandemic have been a distraction, including Lawrence Gostin, a global health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. Gostin has been openly critical of the WHO in the past - in particular for what he considered to be moving too slowly to declare international emergencies over Ebola and Zika. With the COVID-19 outbreak, however, Gostin said the WHO was right to not describe it as a pandemic prematurely because the word tends to generate fear.Global health specialists say that more subtleties in how WHO messages around epidemics could be useful, but say they doubt it will make much practical difference. In the end if you move from a binary to a three or four stage process, youll always have these semantic arguments, said Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity. And is there really a difference between a global epidemic and a pandemic And does it make a difference to what we do he said. I dont think so.

Leader' and 'perfectionist' were two of the words the 1995 edition of Maghera's school magazine, 'The Patrician', used to describe MacRory winning captain Sean Martin Lockhart.   In school tradition at the time, every senior panel member would have a short synopsis penned about them. Lockhart was described as one of the most 'complete' colleges' players for a 'long time'.   “He was as solid as a rock, as you'd imagine and he was always on the dangerman,” adds Padraig McKaigue who, with no previous goalkeeping experience, played behind him for both Derry minors and Maghera.   McKaigue also points to a 'roasting' Lockhart dished out to current Cavan minor manager Mickey Graham in an Ulster minor semi-final.   Damian McErlain, who played on the 1995 team with Lockhart, rated Maghera's full-back line that year – John Heaney, Niall Farren and Micheal Kelly – as the best he has played with or managed.   “Nobody will ever appreciate how good they were,” he states.   And then there was Lockhart. McErlain remembers the 'No Fear' t-shirt Sean Marty would often wear and the jovial Niall Farren giving him plenty of stick for wearing it.   “You can practice, practice, practice – I'll still beat you,” read the slogan on the back.   It was made for him reckons McErlain, who played at centre-forward. His battles with Lockhart 'at least once' a week at training were 'savage'.   “Some days you just never got a ball,” McErlain remembers. “Then, you'd have a good day and hit 1-1 or something. You knew about it the next day – he took to you like a day's work.”   Now, 25 years after captaining Maghera to a 12-point final win over St Colman's, Lockhart leads Maghera into another final against their Newry rivals.   The return nearly didn't happen. Lockhart had initially planned to leave school after fifth year to become an electrician. There were also murmurs of a route into accountancy.   “I would never have saw myself as a teacher or a manager. Back then, I had a job in an accounts office,” Lockhart recalls, but now there are no regrets.   “It's a flash,” said Lockhart, of his memories. “I am talking to you about this year's final...that was our year and I can't believe it is 25 years.”Back in the day, the careers' room was the hub for pre-game meetings. Adrian McGuckin would address the panel with a detailed and pristinely bound portfolio, specially commissioned for every game.   It had everything from bus times to warm-up details. From a team list to a synopsis of the other team's strengths and weaknesses. There was a plan for playing with an extra man or having a man sent off. Every base was covered.   Now, that corner on the second floor of the three-storey building houses the school staffroom. The faces have changed, but constant murmur of football chat competes with the aroma of hot tea.   Lockhart's MacRory career spanned three and a bit seasons. In 1992, as a fourth year, he was added to the panel towards the end of the campaign. The following year, he was corner-back. They needed two games to get over a St Patrick's Armagh attack that had the bustling Des Mackin on the edge of the square.   “Dessie's gonna get you,” came the chants in the direction of Seanie McGuckin, who would win the battle. The final was a different story against St Colman's. Mackin's county minor team-mate Diarmuid Marsden missed a penalty, but the Violet Hill men still took the cup, on their way to a Hogan title.   In 1994, Seanie McGuckin was now the fulcrum of the attack, leaving Lockhart to wear the number three jersey. Maghera went one better with St Patrick's Armagh in the Athletics Grounds. Lockhart gave away height and weight to full- forward Conor McGurgan, but not much else in assured performance.   Another masterclass, as McKaigue put it, came against Pat Spillane's nephew (Eamonn) in a landslide win over St Brendan's Killarney to set up a date with St Jarlath's Tuam and a chastening 3-11 to 0-9 defeat.   It was a team that included Michael Donnellan, Padraig Joyce and Tommy Joyce, John Divilly, Declan and Tomas Meehan.   “We had no specific plan to go for goals, but we were encouraged to go for them if they were on,” reveals former Donegal player John Haran, who was on that Jarlath's panel.   “If you ever watch that game on video, Maghera actually had a lot of possession and missed a lot of chances. History is cruel, as it looked like an easy win.”   Full-forward for Jarlath's was underage superstar John Concannon. He scored 1-4 that day, but failed to reach the same inter-county heights as the rest of the crop. Haran's St Eunan's team-mate Kevin Winston lashed in the first goal, before the Concannon show kicked in. It was a 'humbling' hour for Lockhart.   ”All through that year, there was a chant ' you'll never beat Sean Lockhart' but after 10 minutes he (Concannon) had skinned me, scored 1-1 and the chant just stopped.”

Over the course of the last several weeks, as the number of infected people across the globe has exploded, communities are realizing the safest way to avoid spikes in infections and protect limited healthcare services was to advise "social distancing," to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Setting aside sporting event crowds, the proximity of players, particularly in contact sports, makes them particularly vulnerable to infection.
 It could be months before the virus is under control in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some areas will most certainly be harder hit than others. So, leagues will have to balance the greater good against not only the cost to themselves but to all of their partners and staff members. Dallas Mavericks owner Marc Cuban announced he would continue to pay arena staff members during the suspension and it is expected many other owners may follow suit.

Interest rate cuts won't cure the coronavirus but investors are still hoping the Federal Reserve can take some actions to help soothe the roiled stock market.
 Only days after a rare emergency rate cut, the Fed is expected at its regularly scheduled meeting next Wednesday to slash its target rate another 75 to 100 basis points to near zero, according to the CME FedWatch website. The U.S. central bank also may announce measures to ensure sufficient liquidity and lending or to purchase assets by restarting the quantitative easing that the Fed employed during the financial crisis.
 A move like that could offer some comfort to investors after Thursday's bruising decline, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its biggest one-day drop since 1987. "If the market feels the Fed is responding appropriately and is helping investors and consumers, and feel like somebody is in charge, maybe that can help settle things down,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
 Indeed, stocks briefly pared losses on Thursday after the New York Fed said on it will introduce $1.5 trillion in new repo operations this week and start purchasing a range of maturities as part of its monthly Treasury purchases. But the rebound was short lived and the S&P; 500 ended down 9.5% on the day. Expectations for a more significant rate cut have increased this week as the market decline deepened over fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. As of Thursday, the S&P; 500 had fallen more than 26% from its Feb. 19 record closing high, including a drop of more than 16% so far for the week.
 Traders currently expect the Fed to cut its target rate from its current range of 1-1.25% to as low as 0-0.25%. Some market watchers wonder if the central bank could even eventually go into negative territory. "Central banks must bolster confidence that they are willing to test the limits of where they view the effective bound on rates," JPMorgan Chase economists said in a note this week.
 Markets will respond "poorly" should the Fed fail to cut rates, said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones, but added that "the risk of aggressive action now is that you sacrifice valuable ammunition in the short term to boost short-term market sentiment." "You might need the ammunition further down the road if unemployment increases or deflation starts," Richardson said.
 Of course, rate cuts may not help equities. The S&P; 500 ended up falling 2.8% on March 3 despite the Fed's surprise half-percentage point cut, which boosted sentiment but also led investors to speculate on what other actions the Fed could take. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said last week that the central bank needed "to think broadly about what tools we would use" if the virus continues to weigh, and that it "could be important" to let the Fed buy assets other than U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.
 Such asset purchases aimed at stimulating the economy, known as quantitative easing (QE), were a key tool used by the Fed to emerge from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. "Should the Fed gauge that reducing rates is not providing for easier financial conditions, we expect it to quickly turn to quantitative easing," Morgan Stanley economists said in a note.
 Whatever actions the Fed takes, some investors said they are ultimately secondary to the responses of the world's governments. In the United States, partisan gridlock threatens to derail the government's ability to contain the economic damage. Democrats in the House of Representatives have unveiled a plan that would expand programs including food assistance and unemployment aid. The Republican-led Senate will delay its recess to work next week on its own legislation.
 "While we think central bank policy is important, we think the fiscal is much more important at this stage," said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. will ban the entrance of travelers from all European countries except the UK for the next 30 days. This is the same measure Washington took against China during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, and now it is imposed on the European continent as the virus is spreading across the globe. The World Health Organization officially declared on Wednesday COVID-19 a pandemic, the highest level of alert for an infectious disease.      Cutting off the human exchange with Europe is an unprecedented, radical measure for the U.S., as Europe and the U.S. have shared the same destiny as the Western Bloc and intertwined with human and commercial exchanges. Severing human exchanges with Europe is almost reminiscent of the times of the First and Second World Wars. With the WHO declaring a pandemic on COVID-19 and calling for more aggressive responses, President Trump has decided to keep a good distance between countries, nay, between continents now.      Trump’s decision is in a way unavoidable to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, but it is in the same vein with his protectionism and nationalism, which has eroded the order of the free world. The massive influx of refugees from the Middle East and Africa into Europe stoked fascism, triggered BREXIT, and ultimately led to America’s “Trumpism.” In fact, Trump’s America is now erecting walls against immigrants, waging trade wars, and championing protectionism. And the isolating wall of the virus has been added to the list.      The coronavirus pandemic has brought about the fear of the perfect storm to the global economy. After the temporary rallying, stock markets are collapsing across the globe. Previous global economy crises stemmed from financial sector, but the impact from the current pandemic will be even more devastating as it is cutting off trade and production, shaking the very root of the real economy. Companies and small business owners will take the fall, and with the mounting cases of bankruptcy, some countries will be on the brink of a total collapse. Heavy-handed measures such as travel bans or violation of privacy will prevail in the name of safety.      Of course, a temporary cut-off will not necessarily cripple the world community connected through globalization and sharing of information. But the psychological trauma might prove abiding, which could change the modus vivendi of international community. Pandemic is a new reality, and South Korea stands at the center of it. The increase of confirmed cases is not as steep, and the U.S. has yet to impose an entrance ban, but it is never a time for complacency. Now is the time for South Koreato build a comprehensive strategy for national security covering not only quarantine, but international coordination, diplomacy, and a measure to boost the local economy.

A brief downpour not out of the question but average rainfall totals stay around 0.25-0.50″. High temperatures today in the low to mid 50s. Cold front pushes through early with winds staying strong through the afternoon our of the west northwest 15-25 mph and gusts over 30 mph possible. Showers linger into the afternoon but we see some clearing in the skies and even some sunshine to end the day. Tonight we remain dry with lows chilly, falling into the mid to upper 20s.

"We didn't have our best game in terms of passing and controlling, and it wasn't easy on that pitch with this ball, but at the end of the day we scored five goals, we are happy and ready to come back to Manchester.

“We want to bear in mind that in addition to considering the actual direct impacts on our campus, we want to be responsible from a public health perspective, recognizing that if we felt that after spring break people's travels had placed us more at risk, we might do more kind of social distancing of you know, creating fewer large events or we're doing some things differently,” Byerly said.

It was his last chance at a Hogan Cup medal. The following year, 1995, he was one of six players, including starters David O'Neill, Mark Diamond and Fintan Martin, who were overage for the All-Ireland series. Panellists Sean McPeake and Dominic Lynn, who would've been in contention, were also ineligible.   The MacRory would be his last hurrah. In the quarter-final against St Macartan's Monaghan, with Lockhart now as captain, goals from David O'Neill and Mickey Gribbin put them on their way.   Six days ahead of the semi-final, Maghera – with eight starters missing – defeated St Jarlath's Tuam, who had 11 of the Hogan winning team on view, in a low-scoring challenge game in Aghadrumsee. It was the perfect ending to the preparations.   “We had a strong upper six and a strong lower sixth group. We were coming off the back of winning the Rannafast and there was great character in our team with a never say die attitude,” Lockhart feels.   “We played Abbey (in the semi-final). They had John McEntee, Tony McEntee, Enda McNulty and Aidan O'Rourke at a snow-swept Armagh.”   Leading 0-7 to 0-0 at the break, Maghera had to face the elements in the second half but a Mark Diamond thunderbolt ot the net, into the driving snow, quashed any Abbey hopes.   Now preparing for the final as a manager, Lockhart can now fully appreciate the support structures from his playing days.   “Back then, as a player, you are in a wee bubble and Adrian protected us and he kept our feet firmly on the ground   “Now as a manager, you have to organise food, travel, promotion and the media, so you see the whole package. But one thing you do see, you see the impact on the school. As a player, you thought it was about us in the team. It didn't go totally to plan for Lockhart in 1995.   “I remember breaking my finger the year before the final. I was playing pool with a few of my mates and we were just messing about.”   It didn't matter, the final was a walk in the park. Colman's got the first point of the game, the only time Maghera were behind all year. That was as good as it got for the Newry side. They failed to score for over three quarters of the game and Lockhart – who also kicked a point - was left to lift the cup.   It wasn't long until he received the call from Derry senior manager Mickey Moran. Within three years of leaving school, he would pick up an All-Ireland U21 medal and was full-back on the last team to win the Ulster SFC, in 1998.   He never gave Tony Boyle a kick in the Ulster final and combined with a performance on Padraig Joyce later in the year, he picked up an all-star.   It was a baptism of fire in the early seasons as an inter-county defender. He vividly remembers a league clash with Clare and a tough afternoon marking Gerry McInerney. Lockhart has never forgotten the name.   “I was wing-back and he scored 1-3 off me and skinned me. The older boys, like Henry Downey and Kieran McKeever, came over and said 'Sean Marty, you have made the county, your learning starts now'.   “I went back into full back and you had to educate yourself. You had collective training and there was the individual work yourself. I had plenty of battles with boys after it.”   Over the next week, Maghera's defenders don't need to look any further for advice on how to curb the St Colman's attack.   As our conversation finishes, Liam Kielt appears on the scene. After a brief, general, natter on football, his former Corn na nÓg manager enquiries about the Newry challenge. Lockhart recites a litany of names and dangers.   “They have a good forward line,” was the sweeping statement centred on next Tuesday's task   The preparations had long since begun. The 1995 school magazine wasn't far off the mark. Leader. Perfectionist. And so the cycle continues.
