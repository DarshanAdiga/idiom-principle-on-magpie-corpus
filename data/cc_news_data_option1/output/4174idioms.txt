The stock market "does not represent all of the economy by any means," Joy elaborates. "It doesn't represent the public sector, which is a significant component. So, federal government, state and local governments, not represented. And it doesn't represent the financial condition of the vast majority of Americans, who don't own stocks. And so, as a result, the performance of the stock market doesn't necessarily reflect the performance of the economy. The two tend to go hand in hand. But one is a subset of the other."

 ##  Joanna Bache Tobin
 The first time I met Joanna Bache Tobin was in a parent/teacher conference re: her daughter Diana. Diana was one of my excellent students, now a freshman at the College of Wooster in Ohio, and Joanna was making the rounds at Annapolis High School to meet Diana’s teachers.
 Right away I connected with her and knew she was a parent who cared. She also cared in a deeper way through her active involvement in the Parent Teacher Student Association at AHS. While Diana was her priority, it was clear to me that Joanna believed Diana’s success was also inextricably linked to AHS’s success in meeting the needs of all students.
 When I learned of Joanna’s interest in running for the Anne Arundel County Board of Education, I was on board right away. When I heard her compelling personal story and read about her qualification, both educationally and through her personal experience as an educator, it was clear to me that Joanna had the depth of knowledge and the breadth of experience to meet whatever challenges AACPS would confront as a member of that Board.
