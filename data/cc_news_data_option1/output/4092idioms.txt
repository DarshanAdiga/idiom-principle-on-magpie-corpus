Five years after Israel signed a landmark agreement to develop large offshore gas fields over the objections of antitrust authorities, environmentalists and consumer advocates, ordinary Israelis have yet to see the windfall promised by the government. less

“Outside of that one instance where they scored the goal, I thought the defenders did very well tonight,” veteran goalkeeper Evan Bush said after the game. “I thought Erik (Godoy) was great, I thought Ranko (Veselinovic) was very good to step in as a young guy, to step into that position, I thought he did very well, by and large. And then having Derek (Cornelius) come in to fill out the third centre back and then our outside backs did very well too.”

Corey Harawira-Naera wants to repay Canberra's faith in him before returning to the tools this summer with those who helped him through his darkest days.
 Harawira-Naera's 2020 rollercoaster is 80 minutes away from ending in an NRL grand final, after at one point staring down an entire season out of the game.
 Deregistered by the NRL in March for his role in the Canterbury sex scandal, Harawira-Naera had all but given up hope of playing again in 2020.
 He engaged in talks with the Raiders about a possible return, but did not believe there was any chance it could come this season.
 Eventually, his deregistration was overturned, before a drawn-out negotiation with the Bulldogs to be released from his contract for an immediate exit for Canberra.
 "It's pretty crazy. I couldn't have imagined (I'd be playing finals football) four or five months ago," the 25-year-old told AAP.
 "I thought best-case was a year off. Never did I think it was going to be this year.
 "It was a bit of a mess early on but once I heard that Canberra were going to be keen it was quite an easy decision."
 A Kiwi Test star, Harawira-Naera was almost an 80-minute player last year starting for the Bulldogs.
 But after 11 months between games, he has only had limited bench time at Canberra this year.
 "I'm not going to kick stones if I only play five minutes (against Melbourne in Friday's preliminary final)," Harawira-Naera said.
 "Whatever Rick wants out of me is what I'll get. All I can do is try and impress him with whatever time I do get.
 "I was kicking stones a few weeks ago but then you think about it. I could still be landscaping in 30-degree heat.
 "I was happy to work for the rest of the year, but obviously it doesn't compare to trying to win premierships."
 Not that Harawira-Naera is opposed to returning to landscaping in the heat of the summer.
 He has previously spoken at length about the mental demons he battled in his three months in limbo.
 But he now credits his time with Dredge Brothers landscaping in south-west Sydney for helping his life get back on track after a friend set him up with a job.
 One day became two, before he eventually began working close to full weeks and some Saturdays.
 "For the first two months when I got deregistered I was just drinking and stuff," Harawira-Naera said.
 "Then I got hold of a mate who helped me out with it.
 "It helped me de-stress. It did help."
 Which is why he intends on returning to help again this summer.
 "It'll be grounding," he said.
 "I will probably go back and do a bit of work with them in the off-season to try and stay busy.
 "At the moment we're not going to be back until January so I will go back and do that."

Teachers are a keystone of the nation's economic recovery. We need to return to classrooms so that students can learn, and parents can return to work.
 Yet, across the country students, teachers and families are in limbo, contending with virtual schooling, which isn't an ideal learning environment.
 To get teachers like me safely back in schools as soon as possible, we must reduce the risk of spreading this disease to our colleagues and students. I want to get back in the classroom just as much as the families whose kids I teach. By routinely taking COVID-19 tests, even if asymptomatic, we can reduce the school outbreak risk that would significantly set back reopening timelines.
 A major barrier to achieving this testing peace of mind is the lack of cost certainty around COVID-19 diagnoses. If teachers like me have to worry that COVID-19 tests might generate ruinous medical bills, we will be far less likely to get the care we need and our students deserve. Testing price transparency is the solution.
 I speak from personal experience. This spring, I tried to get a COVID-19 test but didn't fit the profile required to receive one at the time. Instead, I was forced to go to the ER to get a chest X-ray, but I also received an EKG, IV fluids, a flu test and a pregnancy test, because I was in rough shape when I arrived. I was hit with $4,500 worth of associated bills, brought down to $3,200 by insurance, in the ensuing weeks. (It turned out that I had contracted COVID-19. While my medical health has recovered, my financial health has not. Fighting these bills has been a part-time job in and of itself.)
 I'm not alone. There are countless stories of patients like me who are denied COVID-19 tests, yet receive five-figure bills for other related exams. Patients who do receive COVID-19 tests have been charged roughly $6,500. While these bills are outliers, tests regularly range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
 According to a Gallup Poll, nearly one in six Americans with COVID-19 symptoms would not get tested for fear of unknown costs. Hidden health care prices are, therefore, not only a financial threat but also a public health menace. Hidden prices will delay the safe reopening of classrooms and the associated economic growth.
 If teachers -- and all Americans -- knew exactly what they had to pay for a COVID-19 test and that they wouldn't be subject to additional related charges, more people would get tested and fewer would get infected. This price certainty would give us the freedom and control to get tested when and where we want.
 Health care price transparency offered systemwide can provide health care consumers with cost certainty over all their care, ending the bizarre status quo where patients are blinded from prices until they receive their bills in the mail weeks and months after treatment.
 Price transparency can also lower runaway health care costs. With access to real prices, patients can shop around for less expensive care and find better value the same way we do for auto repair, hair styling and life insurance.
 Empowering patients with prices will enable us to steer clear of price-gouging providers who charge $6,500 for COVID tests, $20,000 for broken arms or $600 for Band-Aids. Vast price differentials for the same health care services in the same market will converge. Ensuing market competition will put further downward pressure on prices.
 According to a recent nationwide poll, nearly 90% of Americans and 98% of women under the age of 40 support this commonsense reform. Almost no other issue in today's politically polarized environment enjoys such overwhelming bipartisan support.
 By providing COVID-19 testing cost certainty to teachers, health care price transparency can make classrooms safer and return children faster, allowing parents to return to work, boosting the economic recovery.
 Just like how students rely on teachers to provide them with knowledge, teachers and all Americans need health care price information.

The first to write in a serious way about this sense of panic was Michael Anton, whose pseudonymous essay “The Flight 93 Election” appeared in _The Claremont Review of Books_ in September 2016. In it, he explained why so many Republicans were willing to fall in line with Donald Trump. A critical mass of conservatives believed that another four years of Democratic rule would not only be disastrous for the country. They feared that the left’s continued conquest of the administrative state, as well as popular culture, would undermine individual liberty and the rights of religious believers in ways that would transform the United States into something unrecognizable and alien to basic republican principles.

ATLANTA (AP) - Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia is set to face Democrat Jon Ossoff in the first debate of their U.S. Senate race Monday afternoon.
 The debate will be held virtually with candidates joining by video conferencing from separate locations. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 213,000 people in the U.S., is likely to be front and center.
 Ossoff has already sought to make Perdue's handling of the pandemic a central part of the campaign, accusing him of downplaying the risk of the virus and undermining scientists.
 Perdue's campaign has fired back, saying Ossoff is skewing his record and that the senator has helped secure billions of dollars in economic assistance, as well as protective medical gear and drugs for treatment.
 While statewide races in Georgia tend to favor Republican candidates, public polling shows a neck-and-neck battle between Perdue and Ossoff. That's led to huge sums of money being spent on advertising by both the candidates and outside groups with a stake in the outcome.
 Georgia's other Republican-held U.S. Senate seat is also up for grabs this year, and more than $150 million has been committed to ads in the two races combined, including past spending and future reservations.
 Perdue, 70, is a former business executive who is seeking his second term in the Senate. Ossoff, 33, heads a media company that investigates crime and corruption for news organizations.
 Monday's debate will take place the same day the Senate Judiciary Committee is set to begin hearings in Washington on President Donald Trump´s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, opening another potential avenue of contention between Ossoff and Perdue.
 Republicans including Perdue are pushing for a quick confirmation of the judge, while Democrats have said that any appointment should wait until after the election.
 Perdue has lauded Barrett, saying in a recent statement that she "will be an exceptional Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court."
 Ossoff meanwhile has raised questions about what confirmation of Barrett would mean for the future of the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law passed by Congress in 2010.
 "Will Judge Barrett impartially uphold the rule of law and defend the public interest by upholding the Affordable Care Act, which prevents insurance companies from denying health coverage to Americans suffering from cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other pre-existing conditions?" Ossoff asked in a recent news release.
 The Supreme Court will soon hear arguments in a challenge to the law by the Trump administration and Republican-led states including Georgia.
 Monday's debate, which is the first of three debates scheduled in the race, will also include Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel.

 # Squicquero's tale demonstrates the travails of Italian immigrants
 By Louise Carroll
 For The Ledger
 ELLWOOD CITY – Life was not easy for the Italian immigrants who help create the community, including Angelo Squicquero.
 Italian immigrants helped build the railroads that opened the area to industries. They helped build the roads, streets and houses. Some returned to Italy, but many stayed to work here and build the community.
 They faced all the challenges of immigrants in a foreign land, including the language barrier. Because of all the difficulties, they formed the Sons of Italy Lodge 608 in 1916, just 25 years after Ellwood City became a borough.
 During the period when the Sons of Italy Lodge was growing and having an impact on the community, a key figure was Angelo Squicquero. His story highlights the gladness and sadness and one of the unbelievable tales of separation and struggles that many of the immigrants lived through.
 In 1906, Squicquero came to Ellwood City and worked at Aetna Standard. He returned to Italy in 1912 and served for six months in the Italian Army, and in 1913 he married Angelina Minnocci and returned to the United States. In 1914, he went to work at the Ellwood Forge. Squicquero sent for his wife, but war had broken out in Europe and she could not travel.
 In August 1918, Squicquero enlisted in the U.S. Army, served as a bugler with the Corps of Engineers with the American Expeditionary Force and was sent to France. He tried to have his wife meet him in France, but these efforts failed.
 At the end of hostilities, Squicquero applied for permission to leave his company and go to Italy to visit her and the daughter who had been born on June 7, 1914, soon after he had left Italy over four years earlier. Government red tape become snagged and Squicquero was forced to leave with the other troops back to America without receiving permission or passports for the trip to Italy. They were received the day after his departure and followed him back to the United States.
 When Squicquero returned to Ellwood City, he applied for citizenship, and in 1920 he applied for passports for his wife and Leta, the daughter, he had not seen in six years. In early January 1921, his wife and daughter were held up at sea for 10 days and then held in quarantine in New York for 12 days because of precautionary measures taken against the typhus plague.
 Squicquero left Ellwood City about Feb. 1 to meet them in New York, but did not return back to Ellwood City with wife and daughter until the middle of March.
 After such a long wait, the Squicqueros had many happy years in Ellwood City. They lived on Franklin Avenue. And in 1922, son Salvatore was born, who later became a physician in Youngstown. Another son, John, was born in 1926 and lived on Rosanna Street, and a daughter, Rose, born in 1928, who married Felix Cistolo. His daughter, Leta, that he had waited six years to see, married a Jones.
 Squicquero was one of the charter members of the local SOI. He was affiliated with Victor Emanuel Lodge, the Hungarian Club, Workingman's Social Club, American Legion Post 152 and VFW Post 252.
 Squicquero's wife, Angelina, died in 1968, and Squicquero in 1975.
 His grandson, Angelo, of Ellwood City, the only member of the family who is a member of the SOI, has many memories of his grandparents and close-knit family. He said his grandfather was of a serious nature, a disciplinarian who was respected by the family and community.
 "He enjoyed his grandchildren. He was always dressed up in a suit and tie, sometimes a bow tie, and he always sat at the head of the table," Angelo said.
 He remembers his grandmother always dressed in a house dress and apron and he recalls what a great cook she was.
 "There was fresh bread, and on Friday we had pizza and Sunday and Tuesday were pasta days. At Christmas, we had the traditional seven fishes, and I still do that. At Easter, we had polenta served on the board with sauce," Angelo said.
 To accommodate the large family, the adults ate in the dining room and the children in the kitchen.
 When Squicquero was 86, the SOI honored him with a testimonial dinner with over 300 people including state Sens. James Ross and W. Thomas Andrews. He received many commendations and awards for his service to the community, including one for being one of the founders of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church in 1916.
 They honored a man who came to the borough as an immigrant and left his legacy on the community.

Five years after Israel signed a landmark agreement to develop large offshore gas fields over the objections of antitrust authorities, environmentalists and consumer advocates, ordinary Israelis have yet to see the windfall promised by the government. less

However part of the reason why premiums have not risen as sharply as some people might have expected is that claims from trial are generally uncommon, according to executives. This is because patients have often signed so-called informed consent agreements, they said.
 Jim Walters, managing director of Life Sciences & Chemical Group at broker Aon, said such agreements outlined the risks that patients were taking by participating in the trial.
 "So, you know, everything from you could have a sore spot on your arm. To you could potentially die. And you know, they would literally go that far in some of these protocols," he added.
 "Those generally tend to hold up in courts and in legal systems around the world. That means that the loss experience coming out of clinical trials is not very dramatic."
 Claims are often limited to circumstances linked to the improper conduct of trials or any wrongdoing, rather than side-effects of the treatment, executives said.
 Such have been the worries about the vaccine race among some members of the public, who fear safety standards could slip, that nine developers issued a joint pledge last month to "uphold the integrity of the scientific process".
 ASTRAZENECA TRIAL SUSPENSION
 AstraZeneca and Oxford University's suspension of global Phase III trials of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine early last month due to a participant's illness brought the risk of side effects in clinical trials to the public fore.
 But the insurers said such delays were not unexpected, and could even reflect the extra caution of vaccine developers given the lack of data about COVID-19.
 "Side effects always happen with clinical trials, but these are typically mild and expected. It is not very common to delay or suspend trials, it does happen though," said Piazzi at AGCS, whose main peers in underwriting trials include Chubb, HDI and Fairfax's Newline.
 "Pharma companies and insurers alike are even more careful than usual with COVID-19 trials because there is so much at stake, particularly for the patients' safety."
 All trials of the vaccine candidate have resumed, with the exception of the U.S. study.
 There have been examples in recent memory of drug trials going catastrophically wrong, though.
 In 2016, for instance, one participant died and five were hospitalised in a Phase I trial run by French company Biotrial in the city of Rennes, testing an experimental mood brightener made by Portuguese drugmaker Bial.
 In 2006, six patients required intensive care after receiving a potential treatment against leukaemia and auto-immune disease in London. One was described as looking like "the elephant man" after his head swelled. Another lost fingertips and toes. Germany's TeGenero, the initial developer of the medicine, folded.
 But insurance executives stress such disasters are rare, given the thousands of clinical drug trials being carried out every year.
 Walters of Aon, speaking about the 2016 trial, said it was "obviously a horrible situation".
 "But that's one of very few incidents of really bad loss experience that the industry has faced. So, clinical trial insurance is not hugely expensive. Let's put it that way."

“So, overall I think it was quite a good effort in terms of the defensive structure of our team tonight. Sometimes, you lose guys in the box and you try obviously not to make that happen, but we'll look at it, we'll see what we can do and it's not always the defenders or tracking guys in the box either. It's also pressure on the ball from outside and stuff like that. There's a number of things you can look at. But at the end of the day, it's much better to look at those things after you get three points.”

Suffice it to say that if Trump somehow wins, Democrats—Jewish or otherwise—are going to be extremely unhappy. The same is true for Republicans if former Vice President Joe Biden retains the lead he’s currently holding in the polls. Many Americans are starting to think that one of the basic elements of democracy—the obligation to grin and bear it when your opponents win an election—may not be something they are willing to accept. More importantly, many on both sides are increasingly convinced that their opponents won’t respect that principle and are succumbing to dark speculations that heretofore have been limited to the imaginations of those who dwell in the fever swamps of American politics.

 And then Carroll rattled off the reasons, starting with the fact it gives himself the chance to test his ability to coach with cool and aplomb in the crucible of white-hot tension. And also because it adds to the reservoir of belief that he is certain the Seahawks will have to call upon again.
 “We’re making memories, you know? Making memories. … It’s just going to make us that much stronger facing whatever the odds are, the issues are, that are coming down the road.”

“It’s not good for my side,” said veteran Republican pollster Whit Ayres. “Pretty obviously, in many ways down-ballot Republicans are in the boat with Donald Trump. That’s good for Republicans in deep red states, but more problematic for those in swing states.”
 Asked for any bright spots for the Republican field, Mr Ayres said: “I’m wracking my brain and just struggling.”
 This account of Mr Trump’s re-election effort was compiled from interviews with nearly two dozen White House and campaign officials and Republicans close to the West Wing, many of whom were not authorised to publicly discuss private conversations. It describes how a campaign that was generally stable for months is enduring a series of historic jolts.

 Republicans began sensing warning signs last month.
 The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg animated conservatives but also electrified Democrats, driving a tsunami of cash toward Mr Biden and down-ballot Democrats. Mr Trump’s heavily derided debate performance only exacerbated the problem, as even his own supporters found him rude as he so frequently interrupted Mr Biden.
 Reviewing data afterwards, campaign aides worried as they started to see Mr Trump’s support begin to slip. The president’s coronavirus diagnosis only compounded the problem, particularly with older voters.
 “It’s not good,” said Alex Conant, a senior campaign adviser to Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign. “It’s been a long time since Donald Trump has had any good news, and when he does have good news, he manages to step on it.”
