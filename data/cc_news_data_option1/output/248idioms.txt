In recent years, some of the most noteworthy breakthroughs in the world of business have come from the field of Green Technology. Be it renewable fuels, solar and wind solutions, software solutions that minimise wastage, technology that cuts back on power consumption, or even the most spectacular success of all - electric cars.


  A decade ago, electric cars were a novelty; but today, they are part of India’s roadmap for a sustainable future. And while there are concerns about India’s ability to create adequate charging infrastructure in time, the overall outlook is decidedly in favor of electric. One of the first movers in this market is Volvo Cars with their recharge car line.


  Volvo Cars have pledged that 50% of all cars sold by 2025 will be pure electric, and have already begun introducing their pure electric models. Plans to launch a new model each year are underway, as is their commitment to reducing the CO2 footprint per car by 50% of 2018 values, also by 2025.


  Volvo Cars commitment to green technology goes beyond pure economics. With a ‘people first’ philosophy, Volvo Cars directs all it’s efforts in creating and designing products with the stated aim of making people’s lives better, safer and easier. This is extended not just to the drivers and passengers of their vehicles, but anyone near and around the car. In a nutshell, everyone.
