Experts say improvements to the city’s sewer system have contributed to declining fecal bacteria levels, and that the scheduled completion of the city’s Headworks Project by the end of the year, will continue the decade-long trend. That federally mandated project involves constructing underground tanks to capture sewage that otherwise overflows into the Jones Falls during heavy rains that overwhelm the city’s antiquated sewer system.
 The Headworks Project is “on schedule and on budget,” said Matthew Garbark, acting director of the city’s Department of Public Works, during a press conference about the Harbor Heartbeat report Wednesday. That means the tanks will likely be up and running in early 2021, he said.
 While bacteria levels have mostly improved over the past decade, other water quality indicators, like acidity and dissolved oxygen levels, haven’t changed significantly in the harbor and its tributaries since 2013. The partnership attributes that to the city spending less on stormwater management as it works to improve the sewer system.
 Excess nutrients, chemicals and salts are flowing into the Jones Falls and Gwynns Falls, negatively impacting wildlife and increasing the chances of harmful algae blooms, according to the report. Since 2013, the harbor has only consistently scored well for dissolved oxygen. Its scores for water clarity and nutrient levels have remained lackluster.
 “Both streams and the Harbor have received increasing amounts of excess nutrients over time, causing a variety of algae to bloom and discolor the Harbor too frequently,” the report read. “And there is still too much sediment flowing into the Harbor from stormwater and constant stream erosion.”
 As part of Wednesday’s report, the partnership also released its action plan for the next decade. It calls for an increased focus on pet waste cleanup, adding that pets and wildlife “may play a much larger role than originally thought” in bacteria issues.
 The partnership’s plan also calls for a “pay-as-you-throw” program that would charge households based on how much waste they generate, and an end to single- stream recycling in the city, which they argue increases contamination in the recycling stream.
 Meanwhile, a handful of projects are already underway to beautify portions of the harbor and encourage recreation, including The National Aquarium’s Waterfront Campus plan, which includes the installation of a network of floating wetlands between Piers 3 and 4.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked the state development department to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a technology developed by Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) scientists for decomposition of crop stubble and provide an alternative to the practice of residue burning.
 Kejriwal directed the department to explore the possibility of using the technology at farms in the peripheries of Delhi, a statement issued by the chief minister's office said.
 "Crop stubble burning is a major source of winter pollution in Delhi. I congratulate the Indian Agriculture Research Institute scientists for developing a low-cost, effective technology to deal with crop stubble burning. Governments need to listen and work hand in hand with scientists to address the issue of stubble burning," Kejriwal said.
 The technology, called Pusa Decomposer, involves making a liquid formulation using fermented farm inputs, and then spraying it over the fields to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of crop stubble. At an estimated cost of Rs 20 per acre, the technology can effectively deal with 4-5 tonnes of raw straw, the statement said.
   
   
 "Research over the last four years in the farm fields in Punjab and Haryana have shown very encouraging results on the benefit of using this approach for reducing the need for crop stubble burning and at the same time reducing fertiliser consumption and increasing farm productivity," it said.
 On Wednesday, a group of scientists briefed the CM, who is scheduled to visit the institute for a live demonstration of the technology on Thursday, the chief minister's office said.
 "He instructed officials from the development department to carry out a detailed cost-benefit analysis and explore implementation of this technology across all farms in outer Delhi that face the issue of crop stubble."
 Smoke emanating from crop stubble burning by farmers in Punab, Haryana and elsewhere in north India causes the air to plunge to hazardous levels every winter in Delhi and nearby areas.
 Every year these farm fires usually begin in full swing by mid-October. Last year, early fires were detected by September 25.
 This year, farmers have already begun burning crop residue in parts of Punjab and Haryana, Nasa satellite images have shown.

The Trump administration may also use its investigative power to force universities to change their approach to racism on campus. Princeton's president, Christopher Eisgruber, recently stated that his university needed to take steps to combat systemic racism at the school, noting, "Racist assumptions from the past … remain embedded in structures of the University itself." In response, the Department of Education has opened an investigation. The department notes that under federal laws and regulations, higher education institutions like Princeton are not eligible for federal research funding or Pell Grants and other financial aid for their students unless they certify that they do not discriminate on the basis of race. The department is now questioning whether Princeton lied when it stated that it did not discriminate, in light of the president's statements.

“Another group of white classmates mocked slavery and pretended to whip each other,” he added. "These were two very public events. I didn’t want to be part of a campus where my classmates held that kind of hate in their hearts. None of those things were ever addressed by the coaches at UGA. There was literally nobody to speak to about these types of things without having fear of losing your position on the team.”

That includes _American Pie_ , _Back to the Future_ , _Despicable Me_ , _Do the Right Thing_ , _Erin Brockovich_ , _E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial_ , _Evan Almighty_ , _Field of Dreams_ , _Jurassic Park_ , _King Kong_ , and more.

Perhaps the most exciting series coming to Peacock is the _Battlestar Galactica_ revival. However, it’s unclear if it will continue the story of the 2004 reboot or serve as another reset for the franchise. A _Saved by the Bell_ sequel series is coming sooner than that, with many of the show’s original stars reprising their roles. Similarly, Soleil Moon Frye is reprising her role as _Punky Brewster_ for a revival series that finds Punky as a struggling single mom who encounters an abandoned kid that reminds Punky of who she used to be.
