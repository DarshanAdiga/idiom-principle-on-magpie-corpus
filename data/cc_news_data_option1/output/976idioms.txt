"Very impressive. I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't see this coming," Ibaka told reporters Monday. "They really surprised me and it's a good thing to have them. Now we know we have a great team with those guys. We know we have a chance to go back and compete at a high level."
 With Ibaka back from an ankle injury and Lowry returning from a broken thumb, the 15-4 Raptors hope to be getting close to full strength as they head into a tough stretch of December games.
 The two were injured in the same Nov. 8 game at New Orleans and Toronto went 8-2 in their absence. Ibaka returned for Sunday night's wild 130-110 win over Utah. Lowry could potentially play Tuesday when Toronto hosts the Miami Heat (14-5).
 "I would say he's a possibility," Nurse said. "I would say he's questionable at this stage, but we will see how things progress. How he feels in the morning, all those kinds of things."
 The 33-year-old guard practised with the team Monday and summed up his injury as "better."
 "It's been almost four weeks now," Lowry said. "We had a target date and things didn't heal as quickly as we thought they would. Now it's just a situation of figuring out how much time it needs. It's a day-to-day type of thing, honestly."
 Lowry has been a vocal leader on the sidelines, and jumping into drills to demonstrate in practice. But he said he's "tired of that (stuff). I'm ready to play."
 The Raptors backups have been a revelation in the absence of the two veterans, and Fred VanVleet has stepped in almost seamlessly as the team's starting guard. It's been a group effort, said Nurse.

SPRINGFIELD - Jerry Costello II has some decorating to do in his office.


  The new director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture still has framed pictures stacked against a wall in his mostly-empty corner office in Springfield. You could forgive him, though; He's been on the job since only Monday.


  Among the few things on Costello's desk are a family portrait and an old dairy cowbell passed down to him through generations.


  "Agriculture is a passion of mine," he said during an interview Wednesday. "It's something that's been a part of my life for as long as I can remember."


  Costello, 51, is just getting settled in, but he says he has a clear vision for the ag department, including uniting stakeholders, expanding the department's initiatives and working with Gov. JB Pritzker to support farmers and rural communities.


  Farming and family


  Costello, son of 12-term U.S. Congressman Jerry Costello, was born and raised in Belleville in a family with a rich agricultural history in southern Illinois. His great grandfather operated a dairy farm in Sesser, while his grandfather ran an orchard and raised beef cattle.


  "Every other weekend I spent on my grandfather's farm," Costello said.


  Costello graduated from Southern Illinois University and enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving in the famed 82nd Airborne Division in Operation Desert Storm. After returning home, he began a career in law enforcement, rising from a patrolman to assistant police chief. He was the top cop at the Illinois Department of Natural Resources when Pritzker tapped him as ag director.


  Bolstering the Democrat's ag experience is the nearly eight years he spent in the Illinois House of Representatives, which included more than five years working with farmers and agriculture groups as chairman of the Agriculture and Conservation Committee.


  "I think those relationships that I've built over the years have helped me to get to a point where I'm very effective at moving agriculture forward in the state of Illinois," he said.


  Ethics


  Costello's appointment came after Pritzker requested the resignation of previous ag Director John Sullivan, who was ousted for failing to disclose the contents of a 2012 email that pointed to a possible cover-up of a "rape in Champaign" and "ghost workers" in Gov. Pat Quinn's administration.


  "I have a good relationship with John Sullivan," Costello said. Sullivan chaired the Senate's agriculture committee when Costello chaired in the House.


  "It's an unfortunate situation," he said, "but we are where we are and we're moving forward."


  Though Costello said he doesn't read every email he receives because he has at times gotten thousands in a day, he said he has a reputation of being "very ethical."


  "I can assure you that there was a very in-depth background review before the governor and his team offered the appointment," Costello said.


  Working with the governor


  Costello was not a stranger to Pritzker when his administration asked if he was interested in the job. Costello served on the governor-elect's agriculture transition committee in 2018.


  "We have a very good relationship," Costello said. "I am extremely pleased to work with him and for him."


  Costello said he expects to be a main courier of Pritzker's $420 million plan to expand broadband internet throughout the state in a program called Connect Illinois. The initiative would especially impact rural and agricultural communities by connecting people to educational, health and business resources with high-speed internet.


  "If we want to keep up with the future, and we want to educate rural kids properly, we've got to have the technology to do it," Costello said.


  Flooding and climate change


  Another issue Pritzker has made a priority is addressing climate change.


  Illinois farmers suffered through record precipitation during last year's spring planting season, which scientists, including state climatologist Dr. Trent Ford, have connected to climate change. Flooded fields delayed plantings and decreased corn and soybean production by about 20 percent.


  "I believe that it's absolutely happening," Costello said of climate change. "You're living in a shell if you don't realize something different is going on right now."


  Costello's former House district, a chunk of southwest Illinois along the Mississippi River, was heavily impacted. Corn and soybean production in the district's main counties, Monroe and Randolph, dropped around 30 percent last year.


  "One of the things that we've got to make sure that we're doing is we're working with the federal government to maximize what we can as far as making sure our farmers are protected," he said.


  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts this spring will be wetter than normal, which does not bode well for farmers as water tables are high and soil is saturated from winter precipitation.


  "We're working very hard in the near term to address and fight flooding such as it may be this spring," Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday after an event with Costello. "Rebuilding our levees and protecting our basic infrastructure is a top priority."


  Initiatives on his mind


  Costello said one of his top priorities will be to expand a program launched last year that encourages farmers to grow cover crops, which are planted between cash crop seasons to protect soil and manage erosion.


  That also includes working with soil and water conservation districts to ensure that "from an environmental standpoint, we're doing everything we can to make sure that we're getting the best yields for farmers, but at the same point in time, leaving the earth in the best possible state."


  "At the end of the day," he said, "the most important part of this industry is leaving it in a position to where we can pass it on to future generations."


  Other initiatives on the top of Costello's mind are expanding the state's new hemp program and helping urban communities grow fresh fruits and vegetables in so-called food deserts.


  "We can help in a number of ways and work with people that maybe aren't considered traditional farmers," he said.


  Costello says he wants to bring ag stakeholders together, from farmers to consumers to groups affected by the industry. He also wants to educate people about agriculture's importance to Illinois' economy, showing how everything is connected from planter to dinner plate.


  "You've got producers and users," Costello said. "One really cannot survive or be without the other."


  Trade war uncertainty


  Illinois farmers have been hit hard by a trade war with China that enters its third year this spring. The Trump administration signed the first phase of a trade agreement in January, however the president said he will not lift America's tariffs until phase two is completed.


  "What's very concerning to me," Costello said, is how the Trump administration's trade negotiations might be straining America's relationship with China. During the trade war, China has found other partners to meet its demand of top Illinois exports like pork and soybeans.


  "You can put Band-Aids on this stuff by taking people's eye off the ball and giving temporary aid, but we've got to have long-term relationships in place in order for the product to maintain what it's worth," Costello said.


  He also did not express confidence in the Trump administration's negotiation strategies.


  "I don't know what the interests are at this point in time," Costello said. "I would like to say that I do. I'm not in a position right now to make that judgment."


  Awaiting confirmation


  Costello is technically the "acting" director until the Senate Executive Appointments Committee votes to confirm him. The committee, chaired by state Sen. Antonio Munoz, D-Chicago, consists of eight Democrats and four Republicans.


  A spokesperson for Munoz said the committee "looks forward to reviewing his credentials" within the window of 60 session days it has to vote.


  Costello hopes the record of bipartisanship he says he built as House ag committee chair secures his confirmation.


  "It's about working together," he said. "We were able to work together to get a lot of things done for farmers in the state."


  In the meantime, maybe Costello can find some time to hang those pictures.

Uber, meanwhile, said it would compensate drivers and couriers for up to 14 days if they get sick or have to be quarantined.


  The viral outbreak has revealed gaping holes in health care coverage at a time when people may need it most. Most European countries and Canada have universal healthcare systems, but the U.S. relies on a patchwork of public and private insurance. About 69% of private industry workers in the U.S. have access to healthcare benefits, but that drops to 43% of service workers. U.S. employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance. But the same protection isn't provided to part-time workers or independent contractors.


  Waiter Joey Ingham, who works at a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, popular with business travelers, says he doesn't have insurance. His protection? Washing his hands more often.


  “If I wasn’t able to come into work, it would be hard to make ends meet,” said Ingham, who waits on 80 to 120 people a shift. If he felt sick, he'd “probably talk to a manager” about what to do, but noted management hasn’t yet outlined any policies.


  Liss-Reardon said most gig workers — independent or temporary contractors — she represents don't have health insurance.


  “We won’t have a fully insured population until we get universal healthcare,” he said. “There are going to be these huge gaps. The burden is falling on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. This is just another example.”


  The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends workers without insurance contact a local health department or community health center for help. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends emergency room visits only for patients who are very sick.


  In France, where people have the right not to work and get full pay when they consider their workplaces to be dangerous, some service staff briefly stayed home because of contagion concerns. Workers at the Louvre, the world’s most- visited museum, refused to work for two days and were only coaxed back after management introduced a raft of new anti-virus measures.

Harvard on Tuesday said it would begin moving to virtual instruction for graduate and undergraduate classes. UC San Diego announced Monday night that all lectures and discussion courses would be conducted online for the spring quarter, which begins March 25. Overall, more than 25 universities in the United States, Mideast, Asia and Italy have announced moves to online learning.


  Other campuses are stepping up restrictions on travel, large gatherings, study-abroad programs and campus events and tours. Caltech officials, citing an “abundance of caution in light of the quickly evolving COVID-19 situation,” announced cancellations of all on-campus visit programs indefinitely.


  “The long-term results of the coronavirus will remain to be seen, but it’s clear that the short-term challenge is probably the greatest that higher education has faced in a generation,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education. “Every college and university is on a war footing about this and are trying to assemble as much information as possible.”


  Mitchell said higher education has experienced such tumult only a few times in the last century. After 9/11, he said, widespread travel restrictions were initiated and some students were targets of racial and religious profiling. During the Vietnam War, many campuses were inflamed by antiwar protests and lost some students and faculty members to the military draft.


  The Great Recession of 2008 financially sapped higher education but the damage took place more gradually, with the University of California losing one-third of its state funding over three years, said Nathan Brostrom, who was UC chief financial officer at the time and now serves as interim chancellor at UC Merced.


  The difference with the coronavirus, Brostrom said, has been the speed of its onslaught and the dramatic effect it is having across campus.


  “Literally every time I look at my computer, something new is coming up,” Brostrom said. “The impact is felt on every part of campus operations. All we can do is continually prepare and be nimble in our responses.”


  UC Merced’s all-in mobilization involves twice-daily meetings on emergency services and teleconferences with all UC campuses to share information and best practices. They review health updates and policies on travel and large gatherings. They nail down plans to continue instruction and research should the campus have to move to online learning. Merced has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus or even reports of potential exposure, and its classes are not affected for now.


  In addition, the UC financial expert said he was starting to assess the costs of the coronavirus outbreak. Merced will pay for any extra costs to bring 21 students home early from study-abroad programs in Italy, South Korea and Japan. Already, the campus is paying for added expenses, such as mega-orders of hand sanitizer and extra campus cleanings.


  And potential future costs loom. Merced could lose needed revenue if the campus cancels summer sessions. It could need to provide financial aid to the largely low-income student body if classes move online and obviate the need for federal work-study jobs on campus.


  So far, UC Berkeley and UC San Diego are the only schools in the 10-campus University of California system to announce in-person class suspensions. At both campuses, classes that cannot be held remotely, such as laboratories and performing arts, will continue to meet. Berkeley has not received notice of campus members who tested positive for the virus or were exposed to it.


  Varsha Sarveshwar, a UC Berkeley senior and UC Student Assn. president, said she fully backed the decision and called on all UC campuses to consider similar action.


  “It’s a really responsible decision on the part of the campus,” she said.


  She added that the transition should not be too disruptive because Berkeley already began stepping up online learning last year when Pacific Gas & Electric shut off power during the Northern California wildfires.

DURHAM -- University of New Hampshire faculty and students say administrators have informed them there's a strong possibility classes may be shifted online or temporarily curtailed after next week's spring break to help minimize the transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.


   


  University communications, according to staff, indicate UNH could shut down for around three weeks. The communications also asked faculty to postpone their spring break travel plans, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.


   


  "The university is preparing for the possibility we don't come back," said Dan Innis, a hospitality management professor in UNH's Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics. "My expectation is we will know in the next day or two."


   


  The notices referenced by faculty and students early Tuesday evening were not yet posted on UNH's health alerts page, which includes updates and tips pertaining to COVID-19, a strain of coronavirus. That page is at unh.edu/health/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19.


   


  UNH spokesperson Erika Mantz told Seacoast Media Group in an email late Tuesday afternoon "no decision has been made" whether to shift classes online or temporarily suspend them.


   


  "As part of our plan, when there is person-to-person transmission infections within the state of NH or the region, a team will come together for contingency planning around potential curtailment of classes," Mantz stated. "This could include options to continue courses online, adjust semester schedules, curtail classes or close the campus. We are taking this very seriously and are ready to adapt our response and strategies as needed."


   


  Innis and other faculty members said they believe UNH is taking proactive steps and has the resources to take precautionary steps similar to Harvard and several other universities across the country that curtailed operations and moved classes online.


   


  "Many campus resources are being provided to make sure the quality of teaching can be best maintained in the event of an interruption," said Molly Campbell, president of UNH's lecturers union.


   


  It wasn't clear Tuesday what would potentially happen to international students and others who cannot go home should UNH temporarily shut down.


   


  "I would think one of the worst places for the transmission of disease (would be) in dorms and apartments," said Innis. "I've got to think the university is thinking about that and they'll have a good plan for it. In all seriousness -- and I'm not giving you spokesperson platitudes because I'm not a spokesperson -- I think the university has a good handle on it."


   


  Innis said UNH's potential announcement shouldn't be construed as "panicking." He said he interprets the communications thus far as the university asking employees to be reasonable and help "take steps to protect folks."


   


  "I have a lot of confidence in them to do the right thing, to make decision based on the CDC," he said. "I think all the moves I'm seeing right now are the right ones and we ought to be in a pretty good spot."


   


  It's likely some courses will be difficult or impossible if attempted online, Innis acknowledged.


   


  "My daughter is a pre-med student at UNH. She's real concerned about labs," he said. "How do you handle lab instruction? It's one thing to put a course online, but how do you put a lab online?"


   


  Innis said he expects the university will do its best to accommodate these issues and any other special cases that arise.


   


  "It's not going to be perfect," he said. "There's no question about it."

Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli questioned the mentality of his side after crumbling to a 3-0 Champions League last 16, second leg defeat to Leipzig on Tuesday to bow out of the competition 4-0 on aggregate.


  Marcel Sabitzer profited from two errors by Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in the first 21 minutes to give Leipzig a commanding lead before substitute Emil Forsberg added the third late on.


  Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho was repeatedly used the absence of key injured players such as Harry Kane and Son Heung-min for a run of six games without a win in all competitions.


  But Alli insisted that is not a good enough excuse for the manner in which last season's Champions League finalists exited the competition with a whimper.


  "We were missing some good players, but that's football, that happens. This is Tottenham, the players that come in have to step up and we haven't done that today," Alli told BT Sport.


  "I think we have to apologise to the fans. They travelled all this way and to go out and lose like that, they deserve better."


  Alli refused to point the finger at Lloris, but claimed Spurs were not mentally strong enough to produce the same sort of fightback as they did from 3-0 down on aggregate against Ajax in last season's semi-finals.


  "We were second to a lot of balls, to concede them goals shows our mentality wasn't strong enough," added Alli.


  "We have to stay together and not talk about anyone in particular.


  "It's not down to one player to score goals, to stop goals, the whole team performance and the mentality wasn't strong enough."


  Tottenham now have just nine games left this season in the Premier League to try and avoid missing out on the Champions League for the first time in five seasons.


  Mourinho's men lie eighth in the table, seven points off the top four, and badly need to end their barren run at home to Manchester United on Sunday.


  "I think probably it is (a) good (thing)," said Mourinho of his side's exit from Europe. "Sometimes difficult moments are moments that can prepare the future in a better way."


  On top of losing Kane and Son, Mourinho pointed to the absence of Steven Bergwijn, Moussa Sissoko and Davinson Sanchez for his side's capitulation in Germany.


  "People can say excuses but I'm pretty sure it is bad for anyone.


  "I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation. In this moment we have matches to play in the Premier League with these players, there are not others, and we go until our limits. Let's see how we end the season."

On Feb. 24, a woman charged with the home invasion and armed robbery of an elderly couple’s home last May pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. Her co- defendant balked and recently told a judge that he wanted a new attorney to represent him.


  That co-defendant had a change of heart last week — upon learning of the results of DNA testing that placed him at the scene — and he agreed to take up the state’s offer of prison time on a lesser charge.


  Debbie Louise Ledbetter, 46, 24 Birch Circle, and William Jefferson Boggs, 54, 1991 Pigeon Ridge Rd., were accused of entering a residence on T.O. Smith Rd. and robbing at gunpoint a 79-year-old man and a woman.


  Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Robert “Bo” Kollros was lead investigator and reported that the two entered the residence — wearing a “Scream” mask and the other a half mask — and assaulted and robbed the couple. The male victim was struck with a baseball bat during the confrontation.


  The handgun used turned out to be a pellet gun.


  The victims’ hands, legs and feet were taped or tied together and the two assailants ransacked the house, stealing three handguns, 23 medicine pill bottles, cellphones, coins and $3,000 in cash.


  The two were arrested the following day and charged with two counts of felony aggravated robbery.


  On Feb. 24, Ledbetter pleaded guilty to one count of robbery and received an eight-year prison sentence to serve. Ledbetter is banned from having contact with the victims and is being given credit for 276 days already served in the county jail.


  Boggs balked at accepting a plea agreement, however. On Feb. 7, a motion to reduce bond was heard before Criminal Court Judge Wesley Bray.


  Assistant District Attorney Amanda Worley told the court that Boggs had convictions for felony charges of burglary, possession of cocaine and theft, and conviction and had been charged in Cumberland County with theft of property, probation violation and served an attachment for failure to appear.


  His record also included a second offense driving under the influence charge in Madison County, and a felony failure to appear on that charge from Madison County.


  She argued that Boggs could be facing eight to 12 years in prison at 85% and argued that bond should remain at $100,000 to ensure Boggs’ appearance in court and to protect society.


  Defense attorney Jeff Vires countered that he was seeking a bond of $5,000, noting that Boggs had lives in Cumberland County for 14 years and that his family lives here.


  Bray, noting the “significant amount of criminal history” and his concern with Boggs being charged with violent offenses, said he was going to deny the bond reduction motion.


  The case was continued to March 23, but Boggs was brought back before the court and appeared before Judge Gary McKenzie, asking that his court-appointed attorney be replaced. Vires acknowledged philosophical differences on how the case should be handled existed between himself and his client.


  Vires also told the court that the DNA results from evidence seized by investigators at the scene had just come in and those results had not been discussed with Boggs.


  McKenzie said he would not consider a change in attorneys until he was comfortable that Boggs knew of the exposure he was facing in the case.


  After a recess, Vires returned to court with a plea agreement signed by Boggs and the District Attorney’s Office.


  Being charged with two counts of aggravated robbery, Boggs pleaded guilty to one count and received a ten-year prison sentence to serve. He is also banned from contact with the victims.


  Boggs is being given credit for 287 days already served.

The impacted spring sports are baseball, softball, boys lacrosse, girls lacrosse, track and field, crew, boys tennis, boys golf, girls golf and ultimate.


  Pappalardi confirmed that all grass fields are closed this time of year anyway but, in addition to that, so are all school facilities, which includes the turf and track at the high school.


  That didn’t stop a handful of athletes — in addition to some adult track- walkers — from coming out to the school to ensure they didn’t lose a step as they anticipate Thursday, March 19, when they hope all will return to normal on and off the field.


  Freshman Wade Massey was in the shadows by the high school gym playing wall ball. He’d been looking forward to the first day of lacrosse tryouts for weeks and came to the high school hoping to work on his shot, but the lacrosse goals were locked up. He used the field hockey cage instead before heading over to the wall.


  “It’s nice they are looking out for us and I’ll take a week and a half off for sure, but I’m kind of bummed my season is starting late,” Massey said. “I wanted to play in the first scrimmage, so that will have to wait.”


  Some of his friends were mountain biking and he planned to join them later on, but Massey still had another hour of work to put in. Though the school has implored students not to get together with one another, that’s a hard sell for many.


  “That’s not going to happen,” Massey said. “We’re going to have social time if there’s a week and a half off. We’re going to hang out. No one is going to stay away from each other, though some of my friends’ moms won’t let them go outside and I totally understand that.”


  Aaron Klein and Micah Arenstein, both sophomores, showed up to throw a disc around to prepare for the ultimate season. The team had a preseason week last week, but Monday was supposed to be the official start of their season, too.


  “So far the first week was really fun and I wanted to come out because our captain, Victor Gao, is really big on no days off,” Klein said. “We wanted to honor what he said.”


  Gao sent out a workout schedule for all players to follow in lieu of official practices.


  “We’re going to try to keep it small,” Klein said. “We actually got an email from Ray Pappalardi saying not to have formal practices. As long as we keep it to a couple of friends that should be OK.”


  Arenstein just couldn’t resist coming out to the turf on such a perfect day. “We’re going to be cooped up in our houses for a while,” he said. “My parents were talking about it and thought it would be good to get out and do something so I don’t go crazy in the house. The team outlined a basic exercise regimen for us to do over the week. It’s a lot of work: two hours a day, six days a week.”


  Junior Anya Kornfeld plays tennis in the fall, but came to the high school Monday to meet a friend to get some laps in on the track. She’s been talking with a lot of her peers who were supposed to begin preseason that day.


  “They’re really worried that our school is going to fall behind,” she said. “They’re not supposed to have any unofficial practices at all. It’s difficult to have that delay when other schools are still open. We’re one of the first schools to have this long close, but I think other schools will follow in our footsteps.”


  She added, “Everyone is just a little disappointed and it’s hectic right now because it was all very sudden last night.”


  Kornfeld said there have been “a ton of rumors” as to who the faculty member in quarantine is and asserted that it would help to know so others can take any precautions necessary. In general, she knows each family will have a different policy about leaving the house and for what reason during the next week and a half.


  “It’s going to be different for everyone,” she said. “It’s just crazy and everyone sees it differently. I don’t plan on sitting in my house for a week and a half, but I’m going to be cautious — I’m not going to go around touching people or getting too close. But I’m definitely not sitting in my house.”


  As of the morning she’d had contact from teachers, but not with any assignments or educational plans, more along the lines of “stay calm, be healthy, relax.” Like many students, Kornfeld has a research paper due later this spring that she knows she can work on and plans to take advantage of the time off to do so. She noted, “Though thinking realistically I’ll get a little bit lazy in the days to come. Today is the first day.”


  Michael Waxman, a junior preparing for track and field, said his team isn’t as impacted because track was the lone sport that starts next Monday. While the athletes won’t have the technical coaching, they can still get in their workouts.


  “We’re going to miss three days of practice, so I would have been running every day anyway, so I’m just going to follow the workout that Coach gave us,” Waxman said. “It’s more fun to run with other people, so we can still coordinate with other people. It’s not going to be the same as a practice, but I could see myself running with a few kids, nothing crazy. I’ll be running anyway. It’s just a little weird not having school, so it’s going to get boring.”


  Junior year can be tough on juniors and many are worried how the missed time will impact them in the classroom. Waxman assured Kornfeld that she’d get her research paper done early, but didn’t expect the same from him.

Bucknell University's students will transition to a "remote education mode" for the remainder of the semester the university announced this afternoon. Class will resume online on March 19.


  While saying there are no known or suspected cases at Bucknell, university officials made the decision this afternoon as they continue to monitor its potential risk to students, faculty and staff both on campus and abroad.


  Officials at Susquehanna University were meeting Tuesday evening, according to spokeswomen Amanda O'Rourke.


  "Out of concern for the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, the University announced Tuesday, March 10, that it will transition to a remote education mode for the remainder of the semester," Bucknell officials reported in an update this afternoon. "Classes are cancelled Monday, March 16, through Wednesday, March 18, 2020, so that faculty and staff can plan for delivering remote educational activities. Classes will resume remotely on Thursday, March 19."


  Campus will remain open the university noted and all staff and faculty "should report as normal."


  According to the release, students are instructed to move out of on-campus housing by 6 p.m. Tuesday, March 17. Students who feel they must remain on campus may complete an online petition form sent to them by Dean Amy Badal.

The familiar thud of a lacrosse ball bouncing off an outside wall of the gym. The sound of a disc whirling through the air at the turf field. Running shoes pounding the oval track.


  This was the scene at Scarsdale High School Monday morning, with the sun shining in the clear sky and the temperatures starting to approach 60 degrees. With the building empty and the parking lots holding only a handful of cars due to a 10-day districtwide schools shutdown following a middle school faculty member testing positive for coronavirus, in addition to a stoppage in the classrooms, the first day of the spring sports season was also postponed.


  Athletic director Ray Pappalardi sent an email to student-athletes and their families after superintendent Dr. Thomas Hagerman notified the entire district of the closing. Pappalardi’s two-paragraph letter included, “Consistent with the District-wide school closure goal of social distancing, student-athletes should not participate in ‘captains practices’ or other team get-togethers during the closure period.”

Yes. If you look at across the board, especially all of the various IO and IO combinations I think the data we had at ASCO GU from cohort 6 is very compelling in terms of response rates, in terms of duration of response, certainly coupled with very promising tolerability. We had one Grade 4 event in those 44 patients, small number of Grade 3s. And when you compare that to some of the earlier data with single-agent cabo at a higher dose, it was really much better tolerated. So we're working with the right population. I think the doctors and investigators have a lot more experience with cabo after having used it for the last four or five years in the renal setting. And we've got I think the right endpoint in terms of looking at RECIST 1.1 of valuable patients. So we've taken the mystery and the -- I'd say the drama out of response assessment by going into this with patients who have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1.

Once infected, the chronically homeless are more likely to get much sicker or die because of underlying medical conditions and a lack of reliable health care. One study last year found that 30% of homeless people had chronic lung disease.


  Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Washington, D.C.; Austin, Texas; and many cities across California have large homeless populations that are vulnerable to an outbreak. New York City, which has the largest homeless population in the country, issued an 11-page document instructing shelters to screen people for symptoms and quickly identify and isolate those who have contracted the virus in a separate room “as much as possible.”


  “We should be very worried,” said Helen Chu, an infectious disease doctor in Seattle, a metropolitan area with one of the highest rates of homelessness in the nation and the current center of America’s coronavirus outbreak. So far, none of the more than 100 confirmed cases in Washington have been among the homeless population.


  Over the past several years Chu has conducted studies of diseases at homeless shelters in Seattle where mattresses, she said, are less than 1 foot apart. Homeless people are “extremely vulnerable” to the coronavirus, she said.


  Chu has argued for urgent steps to test homeless people in shelters for the coronavirus to stop the chain of transmission. But she and other experts acknowledged how difficult halting an outbreak would be.


  The global response to coronavirus outbreaks has been to order people to self-quarantine. Homeless people, by definition, have nowhere to go.


  There are also concerns for employees at shelters — nurses, administrators, charitable workers — who, like health care workers at hospitals, could find themselves exposed multiple times if the virus were to spread among the homeless community.


  In some cases it was illness that sent many of those living on the street there in the first place. Tracy Semrow, who was a school psychologist earning a six-figure salary working with children with disabilities, learned two years ago that she had a degenerative connective tissue disorder. The costs of medical care have drained her savings.


  Since August her home has been one of the bunk beds in the shelter run by McElroy’s charity, Alpha Project. She is frequently sick and sometimes cannot get out of bed.


  “My immune system has gone haywire,” Semrow said.


  The breadth of the homelessness problem in San Diego County, where by last count more than 8,000 people were without homes, shows the challenges that a coronavirus outbreak would pose.


  Homeless people sleep in rows on sidewalks in downtown San Diego, huddling in half-mile-long drainage tunnels filled with rats. And they have erected makeshift homes in the canyons that run through the county.

“It’s hard to be stressed out when you don’t have school,” Waxman said. “School’s the biggest stressor for most people, so when you eliminate that you eliminate a lot of stress.”


  Softball senior Sam Hausman plans to stick to working out in her backyard. She’s lucky to have a live-in teammate and practice partner, her sophomore sister Jessie. The original plan by the captains was to hold some practices, until they got the email from Pappalardi.


  “It was definitely shocking,” Sam Hausman said of the school closing and season delay. “We were all looking forward to tryouts this year since we had such a great season last year. We were hoping for a high turnout of kids because we were worried about numbers. I think of all of our concerns, none of them were that the school would be closed and we wouldn’t be able to practice for 10 days.”


  The setback is a blow as the team is losing four key seniors and welcoming inexperienced and young players, but Hausman is confident her team will overcome the “advantage” the other schools now have.


  “I understand and put it in perspective that this is for the safety and health of people,” Hausman said. “We all understand why this is happening and I think it is important with a teacher in the middle school who tested positive. We’ve seen how this virus behaves and we see how quickly it can spread. I’m not necessarily saying the closure isn’t important, but it is disappointing.”


  Getting in those workouts at home will be “vital,” Hausman said, whether it’s working on fitness, strength, throwing, hitting or fielding.


  “We all have backyards, we all have parents,” Hausman said. “My sister’s a teammate, so we’ll be throwing all the time. It’s making sure we’re not taking those 10 days completely off.”


  That just means the teams will have to focus extra hard and be more efficient in their preseason prep once things are back to normal.


  “We’ll be on the clock with limited time,” Hausman said, adding, “So it’s great to stay sharp on your own.”


  Maddie Amoriello is in a similar boat with lacrosse as a senior. “We’ve definitely been looking forward to it, but it’s good the district is taking these safety precautions for the students, but it’s definitely upsetting our season has been delayed,” she said.


  Lacrosse is a tight-knit group and Amoriello has faith her teammates will put in the work on their own to lessen the negative impact of the delay.


  “I don’t think it will have that big of an impact,” she said. “I just think everyone is eager to get out on the field and start the season. It’s usually cold at this point. Hopefully the weather stays this way.”


  Amoriello will play wall ball and get in some running. “Keeping your stamina up and keeping a stick in your hand is all we can really ask for,” she said.


  Pappalardi had a virtual meeting with varsity coaches on Monday at 1 p.m. to give them an update. He had strength and conditioning coaches Devin Hoover and Alex Greenberg on the call so they could help coaches give their athletes guidance on what they can do to keep in shape for when the preseason officially begins.


  “The needle we’re trying to thread is that if there are things you can do alone or with your family I think that’s OK,” Pappalardi said. “Once we start pulling groups of kids together, I think that’s a no-no. The whole point of closing school is to give people some time apart until the department of health can come up with some guidance for us specifically and for us to come up with a plan. The last thing we want is for it to spread while we’re closed.”


  One coach gave an interview Monday morning, but after receiving a memo later on from the school telling employees not to speak to the media, retracted those statements.


  The Section 1 Conference I athletic directors will have a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday. One of the items Pappalardi put on the agenda two weeks ago was the potential impact of the virus, a situation he was closely monitoring knowing it could impact someone. Pappalardi has reached out to all schools Scarsdale will compete against this spring to alert them that some contests will likely need to be rescheduled.


  “We do believe it’s going to affect the competitive schedule, that we’ll need to make some adjustments with scrimmages and contests in late March,” Pappalardi said. “Weather could have thrown this monkey wrench into this anyway. It’s not like we’ve never been here before.”


  Pappalardi will meet with Scarsdale coaches again on Thursday following the Section 1 meeting.


  Over the last two decades, Section 1 has dealt with a major snowstorm in late fall 2011, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and a cancellation of games following the attacks on New York City on Sept. 11, 2001. Those events disrupted athletics for one and two weeks at a time.


  Hastings and Mount Vernon schools closed two days last week for cleaning and both boys basketball teams were permitted to play in sectionals at the Westchester County Center. Both schools reopened today, but what happens next in Scarsdale and beyond is anyone’s guess.


  Pappalardi said athletes generally need six practices in order to be eligible to compete. If all goes well that won’t be an issue, but that doesn’t mean more won’t arise.


  “This could be a domino effect — this could be us now and another school later,” Pappalardi said. “I have no idea what this means for Section 1 athletics.”

ADRIAN -- It was a strange feeling for the Adrian College men's hockey team to not see its name called on selection Monday last season for the Division III NCAA tournament.
 The Bulldogs had been apart of every NCAA tournament since 2012, ending a run of six-straight trips.
 So when Adrian came up on the screen during Monday's selection show, it felt right.
 "It's where we belong," said head coach Adam Krug. "We made sure to take care of business this season."
 The Bulldogs, who finished the regular season ranked No. 6 in the nation, will begin their ninth NCAA tournament run at 7 p.m. Saturday when they host Horbart in the first round.
 The Statesmen (20-5-3) finished the regular season ranked fifth, but made the tournament as an at-large after falling to Norwich in the New England Hockey Conference championship, 3-0.
 It'll be the first meeting between the two programs, but Krug is a little familiar with Hobart.
 "We don't know a ton," he said. "We've come across them in recruiting, so we know the kind of players they have. We've watched enough to know on offense they are pretty good. Defensively we feel we've seen some things we could take advantage of."
 The Statesmen ended the regular season seventh in the nation in goals per game at 4.30 and 13th in opponents goals against (2.22).
 Adrian (21-5-3) finished with the third-best scoring offense with 5.04 goals per game.
 The Bulldogs boast an offense featuring five skaters with 30-plus points, four of which are underclassmen.
 Senior Dino Balsamo leads the team with 40 points and a team-high 19 goals on the season while sophomore Andrew Bellant is second in both categories with 38 points and 17 goals. Another sophomore, Sam Ruffin, has 37 points on the season with a team-high 27 assists while freshmen Zachary Heintz and Alessio Luciani have 33 and 32 points respectively.
 Those five have played a big role in the team's drastic mid-season turnaround.
 Adrian began the 2020 portion of the season 0-3-2 with a pair of high-scoring losses to a strong Utica team, two 4-4 ties against Milwaukee School of Engineering and a 1-0 loss to St. Norbert.
 The Bulldogs were 8-5-3 at that point of the season and 7-3-2 in the Norther Collegiate Hockey Association.
 Then Adrian beat St. Norbert on the road in overtime, 3-2, to spark a 13-game winning streak.
 "We learned a lot about ourselves," Krug said. "We faced some adversity, but that adversity made us who we are now."
 What the Bulldogs are now is a much better defensively. Before the win at St. Norbert, Adrian gave up 2.75 goals per game and since the number has dropped to 2.38.
 "We learned how to defend as a team," Krug said.
 The 3-2 overtime win against St. Norbert on Jan. 18 was the beginning of a new season for Adrian, one that concluded Saturday with another 3-2 win against St. Norbert, this time at Arrington Ice Arena for the Harris Cup.
 It was the first time the Bulldogs had regained the Harris Cup from St. Norbert since 2016, which was a big deal for the program, especially the senior class.
 "It was huge to talk about the program overall," Krug said. "This senior class hadn't won the Harris Cup and now that they have we can claim that every senior class in program history has won it at some point.
 "To the current team now, it proves we can win a championship."
 If Adrian gets by Hobart in the first round, the Bulldogs will then travel to SUNY Geneseo for the quarterfinals.
 "We probably know more about Geneseo than any other team in the tournament besides Lake Forest," Krug said. "We know a lot about their team, but we can't look at that yet."

“A seat one way or the other, a margin of victory one way or the other, will not solve this dilemma. We simply cannot continue to kick the can down the road for yet another five years.
