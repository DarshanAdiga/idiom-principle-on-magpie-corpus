In an effort to reduce the enrolment crunch at KSS, the board has been contemplating three options: move FI students attending KSS within the Okanagan Mission Secondary catchment area to that school next September; move Westside students to a temporary FI program at Mount Boucherie Secondary in 2021-22; and place a cap on international students at KSS.

As pharmaceutical companies begin to roll out vaccines — the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine from November 8 in Britain already, and as soon as this weekend in the US once the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives its emergency approval — euphoria has given way to appreciation for the challenges involved in delivering the vaccine to 1.3 billion people in India. The establishment of a national expert group for Covid-19 vaccine distribution and Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) to track and manage vaccine stocks and storage is welcome. However, little attention has been directed towards the last-mile challenges in vaccine distribution. Three challenges deserve particular attention. Twice is NiceFirst, cold storage requirements make it impossible to deliver some vaccines directly to people’s doorsteps, as has been the case with other vaccination programmes. Second, if recipients take one dose of the vaccine, but do not follow up with a second dose, they will not be fully inoculated. Poor compliance experience for diseases such as diabetes, tuberculosis and hypertension do not give us a reason for complacence. Third, a small number of vaccine recipients may either forget, not understand the requirement, or may choose to take more than two doses with unknown consequences. Fortunately, India has a unique experience in delivering vaccines at scale, and it would be a pity if we were to overlook this in designing a vaccine delivery system. The Pulse Polio campaign introduced by the Indian government in 1995 is one of the most successful vaccination programmes in the world. Administration of oral polio vaccine (OPV) faced some of the same challenges that Covid-19 vaccine administration is going to face, although at a more limited level. OPV required storage in cold temperatures and required multiple doses. Nurses transporting vaccines found it difficult to maintain cold chain storage, and families were not particularly convinced of the merit of vaccination. As the study by Nizamuddin Khan and Niranjan Saggurti published in the journal, Vaccine, in May 2020, notes, the National Family Health Survey of 1992-93 recorded only 54% of children receiving all three doses of the polio vaccine and 52% of children receiving three doses of DPT (diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus) vaccine. Pulse Polio campaign set up vaccination booths in central locations such as train station, Panchayat Bhawan and parks; arranged cold storage to ensure a steady supply of vaccine to booths; and widely advertised the date and place of vaccination, often via popular film actors. The DPT vaccine was not administered in this campaign mode and, hence, provides an interesting comparison. Children receiving three doses of OPV increased from 54% in 1992-93 to 60% in 1998-99 and 78% in 2005-06. In contrast, full coverage of DPT stagnated and barely grew from 52% to 55% between 1992-93 and 2005-06. When it comes to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine, can we build on this tradition without falling prey to some of the dangers inherent in campaigns? Fortunately, we now have an option of combining vaccine administration with Aadhaar-enabled digital infrastructure. Using biometric identification, it would be possible to ensure that no one gets more than two doses. Camp Calling Moreover, for individuals who do get one dose of vaccine and do not get the second dose, it is possible to send a text message reminding them of the need for a second dose and the location where they can obtain it. Should we choose to restrict vaccination to some priority age groups, it would be possible to identify the target population using the Aadhaar database and invite them to the vaccination camp via a text message. Using vaccination camps as a vehicle would allow us to maximise the number of locations using scarce resources such as freezers and cold-storage vans, and provide vaccination in a convenient location across the length and breadth of India, since each area will only need to be covered twice. Using Aadhaar-linked vaccination records and text messaging will allow us to reduce attrition and make sure that individuals get both doses. Vaccination camps where a large number of individuals are being vaccinated may also allow us to reduce vaccine resistance by ensuring that people do not feel alone. The strategy outlined above relies on an adequate supply of vaccines and a relatively open distribution channel where vaccine prioritisation is based largely on the area of residence and age, but not restrictive otherwise. As Anup Malani from the University of Chicago notes, an India-specific strategy of vaccine delivery would require a focus on areas where the disease has the greatest likelihood of spreading, and a focus on the age group that is most likely to be susceptible to serious complications due to Covid-19. If these are the primary criteria we plan to use, then a campaign-like strategy will allow us to efficiently build on our past successes.

 With this, India will become one of the few countries in the world to operate its RTGS system round the clock throughout the year, the RBI said. This comes within a year of operationalising NEFT 24x7 by the Reserve Bank, the central bank said.

Clemson's rival -- South Carolina -- has currently paused team activities due to positive COVID tests.
 USC's game against Wofford scheduled for Thursday and its game at George Washington on Monday have both been canceled.
 The next game on South Carolina's schedule is set to be against Clemson on Dec. 19. However, it is unknown if that game will be able to be played as scheduled.
 Brownell is hopeful that the game with USC and Clemson's other games throughout the season can continue to take place. But he also understands that there is no guarantee.
 "In the long run, nobody wants to put their players in jeopardy or anything like that. And the health situation in America is not very good right now and supposedly going to get worse around the holidays," Brownell said. "So we're all concerned about it. But I would be concerned about my players and where they would be mentally if they didn't have basketball right now. I don't think some of them would be doing as well as they're doing."

In the monetary policy, the RBI had announced that the RTGS will be available round the clock on all days of the year. “Accordingly, RTGS 24x7x365 will be launched with effect from 00:30 hours on December 14,” the RBI said
 RTGS, which began its operations on March 26, 2004, with a soft launch involving four banks, presently handles 6.35 lakh transactions daily for a value of Rs4.17 lakh crore across 237 participant banks. The average ticket size for RTGS in November 2020 was Rs 57.96 lakh.
 Round-the-clock availability of RTGS will provide extended flexibility to businesses for effecting payments and will enable introduction of additional settlement cycles in ancillary payment systems, the RBI said. This can also be leveraged to enhance operations of Indian financial markets and cross-border payments, the RBI said.
