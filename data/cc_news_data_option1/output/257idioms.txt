“Before I begin, I must say that I can only imagine what you may have heard or perhaps read over the past few weeks. So I want you to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share, not as a prince or a duke, but as Harry, the same person that many of you have perhaps watched grow up over the last 35 years but now with a clearer perspective,” the 35-year-old said during his speech. “The U.K. is my home and a place that I love. That will never change. I’ve grown up feeling supported from so many of you and I’ve watched as you welcomed Meghan with open arms as you saw me find the love and happiness that I’d hoped for all my life,” he continued. “Finally, the second son of Diana got hitched. Hooray.”

As one of the officials most deeply involved in trying to get Ukraine to do Trump's bidding, Sondland testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo in the matter and "everyone was in the loop." Specifically, Sondland said it was understood that Ukraine's new president would only get a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office if he publicly pledged to investigate the Bidens and the Democrats.

After eating we had to pack up everything - diaper bag, playpen, stroller, high chair, not to mention a baby or two -- then drive north toward Flint to visit my wife's side of the family and eat again so we could spend at least some Thanksgiving there.

 Because my parents were European immigrants, I grew up in a small family. The only blood relatives included my mom's sister and her family.
 So we never really needed a reunion; we had one weekly.
 It was called Sunday dinner.
 Over the years, we've grown. These days my own immediate family totals eight. Just getting us together takes effort.
 So gathering my sisters and their families together for Christmas is almost unheard of anymore because everyone is scattered.
 For instance, there's the nephew and his wife who live in Missouri, but they had to visit her family in Chicago for the holidays plus he had to see his parents in Kentucky. All in one day.
 I can relate to that kind of schedule. When my kids were small, we had to take the three-hour tour every holiday. Thanksgivings would begin first thing in the morning when we would drag the kids out of bed and head to my mom's house to eat a big dinner with my side of the family.
 After eating we had to pack up everything - diaper bag, playpen, stroller, high chair, not to mention a baby or two -- then drive north toward Flint to visit my wife's side of the family and eat again so we could spend at least some Thanksgiving there. At the end of the day I felt like I walked to Flint. Plus I was stuffed like those turkeys.
 Then Christmas came.
 At first it worked out okay: Christmas Eve with my side, Christmas Day with her side. But we were running around so much we felt like we were on the run. Easter, Halloween, Columbus Day, whatever the occasion, it always called for multiple visits. Until we just stopped.
 Now our small family from immigrants has grown and scattered. Meeting at someone's house for the Christmas holiday became harder than agreeing on politics. There were work schedules, people who didn't want to travel and those who missed their pets.
 But determination won out. Instead of squeezing into one of our homes, the decision was made to rent a big house in a neutral place. I agreed with the idea as long as I got the biggest bedroom with a master suite and I didn't have to travel more than 10 miles from my house. Plus I didn't want to cook, clean up or share in the responsibility of organizing the weekend. But as a team player, I relented on my demands of being the recipient of the largest gift.
 It all worked out pretty well. All 18 of us were able to make it and that alone was a Christmas miracle.
 There were no arguments about politics, sports or religion and we generally enjoyed each other's company for the most part.
 And I didn't have to cook or clean up or do much more than visit and enjoy a cocktail or two. But I did have to drive all the way to Indiana. And clearly, things will have to change if this reunion thing is ever going to happen again.

“I also know that you’ve come to know me well enough over all these years to trust that the woman I chose as my wife upholds the same values as I do. And she does. And she’s the same woman I fell in love with. We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride,” he continued. “Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited. We were hopeful and we were here to serve. For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this. The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges and I know I haven’t always gotten it right but as far as this goes there really was no other option. What I want to make clear is, we’re not walking away.”

After the trial, more than 30 claimants to abuse by Sandusky netted more than $100 million from Penn State’s insurance company, without the requirement that their claims be vetted or cross-examined.
 Former Penn State trustees chair Ira Lubert, who oversaw the dispersement of money to the 30 claimants, said in an interview, “They’re not all victims. There’s some that were on the gravy train.”
 The news media told the public that “court documents” revealed claims of victims as far back as the 1970s.
 Only two specific accounts were actually released for review. Both “John Doe” stories begged credibility.
 In one, the victim was assaulted by Sandusky in a group shower at Penn State’s 1976 summer football camp, his shouts of protests ignored by others in the shower and by camp staff, and his direct appeal to Paterno met with indifference.
 The cogent factual problem is that those camps sent participants back to their dorm rooms for showers.
 In the other case, the claimant alleged to have been picked up as a hitchhiker in 1971 by Sandusky, who “lubricated him up” with liquor and marijuana before raping him in a public facility at Penn State.
 The “court document” in these widely-circulated stories turned out to be a formal appeal to the court by Penn State’s then insurance company to be released from responsibility for frivolously-conceived suits.
 The John Doe episodes from the ’70s were cited by the company as extreme examples. They nonetheless were widely published as proof that Sandusky had been prowling about Penn State’s environs unchecked for 40 years.
 Confronted with this array of accusers, how would one rank them for credibility – individually or in tandem?
 Given the many hundreds of episodes claimed, in overlapping time frames and narrow windows of opportunity, what full-time sex trafficker could coordinate such a heavy schedule of sexual encounters, let alone a less-than- micromanaging full-time coach in an exhausting schedule of field time, out-of- town recruiting, family life and a national charity to manage with fundraisers and road engagements?
 And all this coupled with a now-known medical condition that compromised his masculinity in his prime, let alone his mid-50s and 60s, when all the episodes alleged in the trial were to have occurred.

The House has finally delivered the impeachment articles against President Donald Trump. Now the Senate is bound to conduct a trial in which it will "consider evidence" and "hear witnesses," as that responsibility is acknowledged on its official website.
   
 More than 230 years ago, the founding fathers put considerable thought into creating the process of impeachment and delegating specific powers to both the House and the Senate as they drafted the Constitution in 1787. Alexander Hamilton then took care to explain the founders' thinking in the Federalist Papers that he wrote to argue for ratification of the nation's bedrock document.
   
 We urge all 100 U.S. Senators to live up to the faith placed in them and their institution long ago to deliver fair and impartial justice as Trump becomes the third president to face an impeachment trial.
   
 A fair trial means being open to considering evidence gathered in months of House proceedings as well as hearing from witnesses and even receiving new evidence, especially in light of developments occurring since the House approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 18.
   
 Just before the House voted Wednesday to formally deliver the articles to the Senate, new revelations emerged that an indicted associate of the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, says Trump "knew exactly what was going on" regarding efforts to use presidential powers to win personal political help from Ukraine President Volodymir Zelenskiy. Additionally, Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, believed to have direct knowledge of the president's actions with Ukraine, has said he would testify in the Senate if asked.
   
 The two charges against Trump are that he abused his power by pressuring Zelenskiy to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially the Democratic nominee to challenge Trump's reelection bid in November, and that he obstructed Congress' investigation.
   
 McConnell and other Senate leaders have criticized the case against Trump as weak and not supported by direct evidence or witnesses, but that is the point of the article of impeachment accusing the president of obstructing Congress' effort to investigate claims against him. Witnesses and documents requested by the House were blocked by Trump and the White House.
   
 It would be the ultimate hypocrisy for the Senate to fail to even pursue the very witnesses and documents that it criticizes the House for failing to secure.
   
 We would like to think that the founding fathers' faith in the Senate to represent the people's interests in fairly judging impeachment charges was well placed.
   
 We urge all senators to live up to the founders' faith in their virtue and give the citizens they represent a full, fair and impartial trial on the impeachment charges against Donald John Trump. It is the least they must do to honor their positions of trust.
