And in that spirit, as one who remains extremely critical of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, may I say, thank you, Mr. President. You did a good thing by allowing money to flow to address a national crisis. Operation Warp Speed, a nearly US$10 billion government program seeking to make 300 million doses of a vaccine -- the initial doses of which would be available by January next year -- shows early signs of success. As such, you have embraced a core progressive tenet that big government, featuring major federal dollars that in this case give scientists free rein to chase ideas, ultimately pays off.

NEWBERRY, S.C. (AP) — Criminal charges against a South Carolina man have been raised to homicide in a fatal August boat collision. WIS-TV reports 26-year-old Dylan Yancey Steele of Lexington is now charged with homicide and reckless homicide in the Aug. 1 deaths of two men on the Broad River. Steele was originally charged with two counts of felony boating under the influence causing death or injury and operating a vessel with no running lights after sundown. Newberry County officials have said three boats were traveling together on the Broad River after sundown, and as they began returning to Heller's Creek Landing, the boat driven by Steele collided with another boat. Killed were 27-year-old Jamie Lindler of Chapin and 28-year-old Andrew Bunnell of Irmo. Steele was arrested and later released on bail. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources says it continues to investigate.

Only a quarter of India's workforce is female as against a global average of 49 per cent and the need of the hour is to unlock the untapped potential of women entrepreneurs, the Wadhwani Foundation, a not-for- profit organisation, said on the occasion of Women's Entrepreneurship Day on Thursday.
 It is clear that India's growing entrepreneurial landscape has left behind women and these entrepreneurs should be provided with a support system comprising an integrated policy framework with equal focus on rural India, said the organisation engaged in development of entrepreneurial ecosystem in India and other emerging economies.
 However, "With women comprising just 14 per cent of the total entreprenual base in India, this is India's big chance to tap into the precious resource of women entrepreneurs so as to realise their true potential," Wadhwani Foundation president and CEO Ajay Kela, said in a statement.
 "Of the 63 million MSMEs in India, only six per cent are women-led, a criminal waste of talent. Growth driving, business-friendly skills such as relationship building, emotional intelligence, and multitasking are second nature to women," the statement said.
 Leveraging India's vast talent pool of women and not allowing it to be frittered away, especially at a time when businesses are facing a severe talent crunch could be transformational for the Indian economic economy and job creation, it said.
 The Wadhwani Foundation was set up by US-based entrepreneur Dr Romesh Wadhwani.

Penn State basketball's upcoming season -- which begins Wednesday against Drexel at the Bryce Jordan Center -- comes with plenty of uncertainty. The Nittany Lions lost former head coach Pat Chambers after he resigned in late October and will take the floor without forward Lamar Stevens to start the season for the first time since 2015.
 Chambers has since been replaced -- in the interim -- by Jim Ferry, one of his former assistants.
 Ferry will be charged with leading the Nittany Lions in the first year of the post-Chambers era and will have to do so while replacing Stevens, one of the best players in program history.
 He and his team are trying to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2011 after missing out on a clear opportunity to do so when the season was canceled last March due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
 The plan for Ferry and the remaining coaching staff that Chambers left is to maintain what the former head coach built and utilize it to take the Nittany Lions to the postseason.

And what of Lord Frostie’s tunnel negotiations in Brussels, will they now be re-aligned to avoid clashing with summer solstice sunsets to appease ‘red wall’ Tory MPs who are superstitious and wear woad? Or will he blink in the face of Merlin Barnier’s sorcery?

That was before the middling ex-diplomat had his Damascene, career-boosting conversion to Brexit.

WASHINGTON — Getting nowhere in the courts, President Donald Trump's scattershot effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victory is shifting toward obscure election boards that certify the vote as Trump and his allies seek to upend the electoral process, sow chaos and perpetuate unsubstantiated doubts about the count.
 The battle is centered in the battleground states that sealed Biden's win.
 In Michigan, two Republican election officials in the state's largest county initially refused to certify results despite no evidence of fraud. In Arizona, officials are balking at signing off on vote tallies in a rural county.
 The moves don’t reflect a coordinated effort across the battleground states that broke for Biden, local election officials said. Instead, they seem to be inspired by Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about baseless fraud and driven by Republican acquiescence to broadsides against the nation’s electoral system as state and federal courts push aside legal challenges filed by Trump and his allies.
 Still, what happened in Wayne County, Michigan, on Tuesday was a jarring reminder of the disruptions that can still be caused as the nation works through the process of affirming the outcome of the Nov. 3 election.
 There is no precedent for the Trump team's widespread effort to delay or undermine certification, according to University of Kentucky law professor Joshua Douglas.
 “It would be the end of democracy as we know it,” Douglas said. “This is just not a thing that can happen.”
 Certifying results is a routine yet important step after local election officials have tallied votes, reviewed procedures, checked to ensure votes were counted correctly and investigated discrepancies. Typically, this certification is done by a local board of elections and then, later, the results are certified at the state level.
 But as Trump has refused to concede to Biden and continues to spread false claims of victory, this mundane process is taking on new significance.
 Among key battleground states, counties in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin have all made it through the initial step of certifying results. Except for Wayne County, this process has largely been smooth. Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia still haven’t concluded their local certifications.
 Then all eyes turn to statewide certification.
 In Wayne County, the two Republican canvassers at first balked at certifying the vote, winning praise from Trump, and then reversed course after widespread condemnation. A person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support.
 Time is running short for Trump. Across the nation, recounts and court challenges must wrap up and election results must be certified by Dec. 8. That’s the constitutional deadline ahead of the Electoral College meeting the following week.
 Matt Morgan, the Trump campaign’s general counsel, said last week the campaign was trying to halt certification in battleground states until it could get a better handle on vote tallies and whether it would have the right to automatic recounts. Right now, Trump is requesting a recount in Wisconsin in two counties, and Georgia is doing an hand audit after Biden led by a slim margin of 0.3 percentage points, but there is no mandatory recount law in the state. The law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.
 Some in the president’s orbit have held out hope that by delaying certification, GOP-controlled state legislatures will get a chance to select different electors, either overturning Biden's victory or sending it to the House, where Trump would almost surely win.
 But most advisers to the president consider that a fever dream. Trump’s team has been incapable of organizing even basic legal activities since the election, let alone the widescale political and legal apparatus needed to persuade state legislators to try to undermine the will of their states’ voters.
 Lawsuits have been filed by Trump allies in Michigan and Nevada seeking to stop certification. Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani argued to stop vote certification in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, the first time he’d been in a courtroom in decades. And the same day, the Arizona Republican Party asked a judge to bar Maricopa County, the state’s most populous, from certifying until the court issues a decision about the party’s lawsuit seeking a new hand count of a sampling of ballots.
 The party is also putting pressure on county officials across the state to delay certification, even though there hasn’t been any evidence of legitimate questions about the vote tally showing that Biden won Arizona.
 “The party is pushing for not only the county supervisors but everyone responsible for certifying and canvassing the election to make sure that all questions are answered so that voters will have confidence in the results of the election,” said Zach Henry, spokesman for the Arizona Republican Party.
 While most counties in Arizona are pressing ahead with certification, officials in Mohave County decided to delay until Nov. 23, citing what they said was uncertainty about the fate of election challenges across the country.
 “There are lawsuits all over the place on everything, and that’s part of the reason why I’m in no big hurry to canvass the election,” Mohave County Supervisor Ron Gould said Monday.
 Officials in all of Georgia’s 159 counties were supposed to have certified their results by last Friday. But a few have yet to certify as the state works through a hand tally of some 5 million votes.
 “They are overwhelmed, and they are trying to get to everything,” said Gabriel Sterling, a top official with the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. “Some of these are smaller, less resourced counties, and there are only so many people who can do so many things.”
 In addition, a few counties must recertify their results after previously uncounted votes were discovered during the audit.
 Once counties have certified, the focus turns to officials at the state level who are charged with signing off on the election. This varies by state. For instance, a bipartisan panel in Michigan certifies elections, but in Georgia it’s the responsibility of the elected secretary of state, who has already faced calls by fellow Republicans to resign.
 In Nevada, Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske’s role in certification is largely ministerial, but she still got a batch of emails urging her not to certify “potentially fraudulent election results,” a spokeswoman said Wednesday. The Justice Department had been looking into one potential case of fraud in the state over voter rolls, but an AP analysis found the case doesn’t appear to hold much water.
 In Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County, a Republican board member, Joyce Dombroski- Gebhardt, said she will not certify the county’s election without an audit of at least 10% of the votes to ensure that some voters did not vote twice.
 Trump won the county, where the election board is made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. A Democrat on the board, Peter Oullette, said he had no doubt that the rest of the board will sign the certification on Monday.
 Philadelphia also had plans to certify results on Monday.
 And some delays could still happen given the crushing workload election officials faced this year during the pandemic, according to Suzanne Almeida with Common Cause Pennsylvania, a good government group that helps with voter education and monitors election work in the state.
 “A delay in certification doesn’t necessarily mean there are shenanigans; sometimes it just takes longer to go through all the mechanics to get to certification,” Almeida said.

Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that the economy will fully recover only when the Covid-19 pandemic is under control. Even then, we likely won't go back to the economy we knew before the pandemic hit.

 As long as there is general agreement that something needs to get done, passing a new stimulus package should be easy, Greenspan said. But in a situation this precarious, one should always ask what might go wrong.
 "I'm not convinced at all that we have enough information to know how to deal with this type of problem," Greenspan said, adding that there could be unintended consequences for society.

 # After long wait, Arizona's Nico Mannion overjoyed as Golden State Warriors' 2nd-round pick
 Duane Rankin
 Arizona Republic
 View Comments
 Nico Mannion waited far longer than he wanted, but it was well worth it.
 The Arizona one-and-done talent who led Phoenix Pinnacle High School to back- to-back state titles will begin his NBA career in Golden State, as the Warriors picked Mannion in the second round (48th overall) of Wednesday's draft.
 "Surreal," Mannion said after being drafted. "You know, when I heard that I got the call and had found out I was getting drafted by Golden State, it was just a rush of emotions because my father was also drafted by Golden State. Yeah, it's unexplainable. It's a blessing come true. It's a great organization, and I'm happy to say I'm a part of it now."
 Mannion's father, Pace, was taken in the second round (43rd overall) in the 1983 draft by the Warriors. He played six NBA seasons for six different teams.
 Now Nico Mannion, a 6-3 point guard who can score, pass, create and plays fearless, will begin his NBA career with the Warriors.
 "I'm ecstatic," he said. "I'm still at a loss for words. I've been with my family for the past 30, 40 minutes since I got picked, and I just keep crying, tears, and it's a surreal feeling."
 Mannion was one of three Arizona players drafted Wednesday as Josh Green (18th overall to Dallas) and Zeke Nnaji (22nd overall Denver) went in the first round.
 "It was a huge night for the program," said Mannion, who averaged 14 points and 5.3 assists last season at Arizona. "When those guys got drafted, I felt like I got drafted. We're brothers, and there's no hatred, there's no envy, I'd say. I'm just as happy for them as I am for myself, and I think they both got drafted into good situations for themselves. So I'm really happy about that, really proud to be a Wildcat."
 Mannion will go from playing with Green and Nnaji to becoming teammates with two-time league MVP Stephen Curry.
 That's taken the surreal life Mannion is living at present to another level.
 "When I found out, that was kind of the first thing I thought of," Mannion said. "I get to learn from Steph. He's been in the league for a while, like you said, multi-time MVP."
 Mannion said the two met at Curry's 2018 select basketball camp.
 "Steph said we had to draft guys who went to his Under Armour camp," Warriors General Manager Bob Myers said with a smile. "So we had to take (James) Wiseman and Nico to keep our point guard happy. He remembers them. He got to know James and got to know Nico."
 Golden State used the second overall pick to draft Memphis 7-footer James Wiseman. The Warriors then used their first pick in the second round to take Mannion.
 "I'm excited, man," Mannion said. "I think the biggest thing for me is I get someone I can really learn from. (Curry's) a vet and one of the best players to ever play. I'm just going to be like a sponge, trying to soak up as much information from him as I can."
 The 6-3 Mannion entered the draft with a chip on his shoulder because he was being slotted to go late first or early second round.
 "Definitely," Mannion said on Monday. "I mean, where I'm slotted, I feel like I'm better than that, but I get it, they base it off college. They base it off certain stuff. So it makes sense. I understand why I'm slotted there."
 Two days later, Mannion was indeed drafted in the second round, but wound up with Golden State, which is looking to become a championship contender again this season.
 "You know, it's not where I wanted to go number-wise, but at the end of the day, I think the fit in Golden State is perfect for me," Mannion said. "I think everything happens for a reason, so at the end of the day, this is the perfect situation for me."
 Myers was surprised Mannion was still available when the Warriors picked him.
 "We had him higher than 48 for sure," Myers said.
 Mannion said he's added 12 to 15 pounds since leaving Arizona to reach 190 or so and tweaked his shot, as he's been training since March in preparation for the draft.
 The 2020-21 season is slated to start Dec. 22.
 "I think I bring leadership," Mannion said." I'm a hard worker. I think I bring that. I think I'm going to earn the respect of my teammates, and I think I'm going to be able to come in and compete and help the team win, and that's what I want to do. I'm just looking forward to it. I can't wait to get out there."
 Mannion has already developed a relationship with Golden State coach Steve Kerr, who was an All-American at Arizona in leading the Wildcats to the 1988 Final Four.
 "I've talked to him before and talked to him recently, and he just seems like a great dude," Mannion said. "I think he runs a clean ship at Golden State, and he's a hard worker, and I think that rubs off on the guys. It seems like he really has his guys' backs, which really pays off in the long run. I think the guys that play for him really will go to war for him because they know he has their best interest and will go to bat for them."
 As surreal as Wednesday night became for Mannion, the chip on his shoulder remains after being taking 48th overall Wednesday night.
 "I'd say a little more than a chip," Mannion said. "But I'm just — I'm lost for words, honestly. I think next year — I don't have any expectations going into the season. I'm just ready to get there and learn and work."
 Kerr has done his part to make sure Mannion brings that edge to the table upon arriving at Golden State.
 "He pumped me up even more," Mannion said. "So I'm excited to get there and learn and work as hard as I can and see what we can do next year."

It is central to his ID as a successful politician. Biden has never met a person he didn't think he could persuade. His glad-handing was often taken for bumptiousness but it served its purpose to break the ice, set the comfort level with whomever he was speaking with.

_• 3 Italian eggplants (about 1 pound)_
  _• 1 pound chicken cutlets, pounded thin_
  _• 1 cup self-rising flour_
  _• 2 eggs, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water_
  _• Salt and pepper to taste_
  _• 4 cups Italian style panko bread crumbs_
  _• Olive oil nonstick spray_
  _• Sliced provolone cheese_
  _• Parmesan cheese for grating on top_
  _• Chopped basil for garnish_
 Slice eggplants about a quarter-inch thick and place on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. The salt will draw out the water, which will remove a lot of the bitterness that is sometimes found in eggplants. Let rest for 30 to 45 minutes, and then rinse off the salt. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
 Place chicken cutlets between layers of plastic wrap and using a meat mallet, pound to a thickness of a quarter inch. In a shallow dish, add the flour; in a second shallow dish, pour the eggs and water and lightly salt and pepper; in the third shallow baking dish, pour the panko bread crumbs. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray with the non-stick spray.
 Taking one piece of a chicken at a time, lightly dredge in flour, then dip in the egg wash and coat with the panko crumbs. Press the chicken into the crumbs and make sure chicken cutlets are entirely covered. Place on prepared parchment paper. Repeat with remaining pieces of chicken.Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using a metal spatula, carefully turn the chicken over and return to oven for another 10 minutes.
 While the chicken is baking, repeat the coating process with the eggplant slices dredging first with flour, then egg wash, and panko. Place the pieces on another parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Let the eggplant bake for 10 minutes, remove from oven and using a metal spatula, carefully turn the eggplant slices over and return to oven for 10 minutes.
 Place one piece of chicken onto a plate and spoon the spicy marinara sauce over the chicken. Place one slice of provolone cheese over the sauce. Now place several portions of the eggplant on top of the cheese. Add a little more sauce over the top and grate fresh Parmesan over everything. Ladle additional sauce around the plate, if desired, and sprinkle with chopped basil. Repeat with remaining chicken and eggplant for the remaining servings.

Alec Baird, retired, believes that the new restrictions being put in Glasgow could be to try and put a stop to any of the traditional workplace gatherings that occur at this time of year.
 He said: "I think we were too early in letting the students go back. Schools as well. I can't see the restrictions being lessened before Christmas, not unless we stabilise it and get the numbers down. I can't see it.
 "This time of year it's usually all Christmas parties, it's no one and the same. Workers meeting up with each other to go out for a drink. I think that was the idea, to try and stop all that. I feel sorry for hospitality and for small businesses as well. I'm just hoping this vaccine comes along."

Look, I really like the MCU with my full coronary heart and soul, however are you aware what I sort of miss? Marvel films that aren’t all instantly related to 1 one other. Now, this is likely to be sort of foolish to say since _Elektra_ is instantly related to the Daredevil film, however is it actually? Sure, Elektra’s demise and resurrection needed to be defined on this film (and is definitely labored into the plot since she will get resurrecting powers herself). But it surely’s not like this film was simply one other stepping stone to the subsequent Marvel flick, which so many MCU movies had been on the method to main as much as _Avengers:_ _Infinity Struggle_.

This isn’t an either/or scenario either, as the middleground of the subtle and overt rumbling has plenty to offer as well. Astro’s Playroom, which is included with every PS5 console, is of course the best example of this technology.

It is easy to counter disinformation by reminding people of a report written after the U.S. delegation’s visit to Ashraf-3 in Albania. Anyone who comes face to face with MEK members in Ashraf-3 discovers that the MEK is not a cult, but a resistance movement which is seeking democratic change in Iran for the good of its people. Journalists have visited Ashraf-3, including journalists from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Times, Reuters, Belgium’s VRT, Scotland’s National, Euro News, and many others. It is only by doing this that visitors see the true colors of the MEK. Otherwise, they have to live with hearsay. One thing that is certainly true about the MEK is that the regime hates it and the only method it has been able to use to counter its popularity is by murdering more than 120,000 of its members. This was in 1988 when these murders took place and Amnesty International called them a crime against humanity.

The Associated Press has not declared a winner in Georgia, where Biden led Trump by about 0.3 percentage points. There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. It is AP’s practice not to call a race that is — or is likely to become — subject to a recount.

Ele lembrou que o projeto foi criado pelo Conselho em abril deste ano, no auge da pandemia do novo coronavírus, e disponibilizou para a população dez salas de teleatendimento visando orientar e tirar dúvidas sobre temas relacionados à oftalmologia. Como o índice de aceitação na pandemia foi bastante elevado – 97% das pessoas deram nota 9 e 10 ao atendimento, o CBO resolveu agora em novembro, quando se celebra o Mês do Diabetes, estender o projeto a todas as especialidades afetadas pela doença.
