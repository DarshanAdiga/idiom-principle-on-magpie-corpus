Die Vorbereitungen auf die Vivawest-Ruhrpott-Tour laufen bereits Monate. „Wenn man da nicht früh anfängt, wird es schwierig, überhaupt gute Fahrer für das Teilnehmerfeld zu verpflichten. Dazu kommen Gespräche mit der Stadt, Polizei, Feuerwehr, das ist schon ein erheblicher Aufwand“, sagt der Organisator vom RC Olympia Buer.
 Mit Alexander Nordhoff, der die Ruhrpott-Tour bereits zweimal gewonnen hat, Vorjahressieger Tim Schlichenmaier sowie 6-Tage-Radrennprofi Hans Pirius haben bereits namhafte Sportler zugesagt. „Schlichenmaier ist in seiner Heimat Kempten Sportler des Jahres geworden. Letztes Jahr ist er mit seinen Teamkollegen 700 Kilometer zu uns nach Gelsenkirchen gereist und musste wegen der Sturmabsage unverrichteter Dinge wieder abziehen. Da hatte ich Tränen in den Augen. Umso schöner ist es, dass er jetzt im Juni hier fahren will“, freut sich Zurhausen. Hans Pirius war mit seinem Rennrad vor wenigen Tagen noch in Australien auf der Strecke. „Der Junge zählt zu den Spitzen-Radfahrern und ist in Bombenform“, meint Zurhausen. Und was ist mit Nordhoff? „Von dem“, sagt Zurhausen mit einem Schmunzeln, „hört man im Winter wenig. Letztes Jahr hat er sich im Januar den Fuß gebrochen und im April in Duisburg das Rennen gewonnen, obwohl er vorher nur wenig trainieren konnte. Den muss man immer auf dem Zettel haben.“
 Gibt es eigentlich einen Plan B, falls sich die Corona-Lage bis zum Juni doch nicht entscheidend bessern sollte? „Ja, den gibt es“, betont Zurhausen, „für uns ist ganz wichtig, dass solche Rennen vor Fans stattfinden. Radsport ohne Zuschauer macht für uns keinen Sinn. Wenn es im Juni nicht klappen sollte, würden wir die Veranstaltung um zwei Monate nach hinten schieben.“ Grundsätzlich sieht Zurhausen bei den Radsportlern keine Ansteckungsgefahr. „Beim Fahren gibt man sich nicht die Hand, sondern nickt seinem Gegenüber zu oder macht eine Geste. Das Problem wird bei der Freiluft-Veranstaltung eher sein, dass Zuschauer in Gruppen zusammenstehen. Wir sind aber zuversichtlich, dass sich die Situation bis zum Juni deutlich verbessert. Ich bin ein positiver Mensch und schaue mit Zuversicht nach vorne. Absagen hatten wir in den letzten Tagen und Wochen genug.“

DECATUR, Ill. (WAND) - Despite a statewide shutdown of schools, day cares across Illinois are not being required to do the same. The state of Illinois believes keeping them open is critical.
 “As long as parents are working, we want families to have access to a safe place for their children to receive care,” the state department of Children and Family Services said in a Q&A provided on its website.
 Daycare owners in Decatur agree, and many are staying open.
 "We're going to try and weather the storm,” Sheri Brown, owner of Kids Castle Learning Center said. "We're encouraging just the working parents to bring in their kids to keep our numbers a little lower."
 Brown said the services offered by day cares are essential right now, and because they are not closing, they are taking extra steps to protect the health of children.
 The Illinois Department of Public Health has only published more general guidelines, recommending the same procedures for daycare centers as high schools.
 “Making sure children are washing their hands when they come in and washing their hands throughout the day and using hand sanitizer,” Brown said.
 Brown said starting Friday, kids at her three centers will have their temperatures taken before being allowed in.
 "Extra cleaning. Deep cleaning everything,” Brown said. “Every toy. Every shelf. Really cleaning the walls and the floors."
 Daycare centers are also crucial to the U.S. economy. A 2019 study found that the total economic impact is more than $99 billion a year.
 The state of Illinois told daycare owners that it will pay them if they close or suffer from low attendance, but the decision is up to each daycare owner.

“Pete did a lot of really good things. When you look at the football program from when Pete started to where it was last year, Pete’s done a lot of amazing things with the football program,” Wilcox said.
 Wilcox highlighted multiple times the culture that Kempf built over the last six years. That’s something he largely wants to keep intact.
 “Pete built a really good culture. He was all about family, turning the program into a family atmosphere, preaching brotherhood and getting guys to work together as a united front on the football field,” Wilcox said. “I think a lot of that has to continue with some of Pete’s policies of making it family atmosphere and keeping people involved. There are going to be some minor tweaks along the way.”
 Tweaks will be made because of two current hurdles in the program’s way.
 Leo and East Noble.
 The Barons haven’t beaten the Knights since 2007 and are still searching for their first win over the Lions.
 Wilcox wants to take the program from just being in the conversation of winning the NE8 to actually taking the conference crown.
 He wants to continue to build up the discipline, bring in coaches that are all about the players and develop a growth mindset within the program.
 “I’m somebody who always has high expectations for myself. I expect to do well, and I think the big part of the success we have going forward is in the assistant coaches. I’ve had a lot of conversations with those assistant coaches the past few days. It sounds like a lot of them are on board,” Wilcox said.
 DeKalb football has been on an upward trend the last few seasons, and it’s up to Wilcox to keep that trend going.
 But don’t worry, he’s been prepared and ready to go to work.

A gas fireplace warmed the back of Rohnert Park restaurateur Gerard Giudice Thursday in the rustic, barnwood-walled dining room of his Heirloom Cafe, devoid of anyone else but a single visitor who didn’t come to eat.
 The resident of more than 20 years was lamenting the major cutbacks and layoffs of people he considers family that Giudice already let go. Among the cooks, bartenders and catering staff, all but five of his 25 workers have been furloughed, and he’s begun desperately slashing utility costs, including shutting down one of his large refrigerators.
 “I’d be a liar if I said I wasn’t scared,” Giudice said, his eyes welling with emotion during an unprecedented week when Sonoma County officials ordered people to largely to stay home for three weeks to curtail spread of the coronavirus through the community. “Yeah dude, we may go down. But if we go down, we’re gonna go down swinging.”
 Giudice, 58, who has co-owned the catering, restaurant and event business for 14 years — 11 at the Sonoma Mountain Village cafe site under the name Sally Tomatoes — has been living out his dream of helping build community one meal at a time.
 He’s also for the past 19 years dedicated himself to service as a Rotarian and a dozen as a planning commissioner, in the process becoming a symbol of grassroots leadership and civic engagement.
 Over that time, while raising his daughters in the city’s C Section neighborhood, Giudice has worked to make his modern Italian fusion restaurant a popular gathering place for residents.
 “It’s like the lights closing on Broadway in New York as a symbol,” longtime City Councilman Jake Mackenzie. “In Rohnert Park, Sally Tomatoes and Heirloom Cafe being lost, to me, would be a big blow to the community.”
 But on Thursday, Giudice had to catch himself speaking in the past tense about what he thinks could be a forgone conclusion his restaurant will fold under the economic pressures suddenly foisted upon small businesses across the nation.
 “You get a little reflective, right? I really hope I don’t have to go out of business,” Giudice said. “But no independents — none — that I know of could survive something like this. It is absolutely a statement about fragility and the fact that life isn’t permanent.”
 To counterpunch against the path he thinks his restaurant is on, he is working fast to change the business model. Although he is hopeful residents will soon get tired of the nonperishable food they’ve stockpiled and begin placing orders for individually packaged comfort meals, prepared in a sterile, commercial kitchen and delivered in a matter of hours, Giudice acknowledged it’s going to be difficult.
 Now, roughly 60% of the business is based on off-site catering of large events, from weddings, funerals and corporate lunches, as well as little league sports fundraisers in the cafe. All of that for the time being has dried up, with 31 of Sally Tomatoes’ 33 bookings for the month of March abruptly canceled, he said. The prospects for summer don’t look much brighter.
 Drop-in lunches, plus evening bar tabs, from SOMO Village’s nearby office workers account for barely a double-digit percentage of the overall operation. So Giudice and co-founder Bill Pettibone rounded out the business with daily activities over dinner for Rohnert Park regulars, in addition to an annual outdoor concert series and comedy nights with name acts.
 Those too are on hold, with booking agents and managers unwilling to consider sending their talent anywhere until October, Giudice said. So he’s thankful for any orders in the meantime, including the three calls he fielded Thursday for family-style dinners, and the 50 box lunches from a friend to deliver to some of the homeless in Santa Rosa.
 “We need to all take a deep breath and reflect on what it is that matters, and what it is that counts,” he said. “If we’re gonna go broke, let’s go broke together with our heads up.”

"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away," was written by Paul Dresser in 1897 and was one of the most popular songs of the 19th century, in part because it was among the first songs to be recorded for the phonograph. The lyrics recall Dresser's childhood growing up near the Wabash River. It became the first official symbol of Indiana, preceding even the state flag, when it was adopted as the state song in 1913.

She spent eight years with Miller Poultry, Orland, with seven of those years spent as a professional recruiter at colleges, attending numerous public relations-type functions.
 “Recruiting at colleges and job fairs has prepared me for the public interaction that this role requires,” she said. “Having been born and raised in Steuben County, I have established trusting relationships within the community and look forward to creating new ones.”
 She is active with Steuben County 101 Lakes Kiwanis, having been a past- president and now president-elect. She is a former member of the Young Professionals Network of Steuben County and is a member of the Purdue Extension Board, serving as president for the 2015-16 term.

“America’s lowest-income renters were already struggling to pay rent and make ends meet before this latest disaster, and people were experiencing homelessness. Congress must implement a national moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

“If this is a wartime situation, then now is the time to act,” said Mell, who is an emergency room doctor in Illinois.
 In recent days, Mell said he felt helpless as he fielded desperate calls from emergency room doctors across the country. On Tuesday, he was surprised to find 10 boxes of N95 masks typically used by construction workers at a local Target store. With certain construction masks temporarily approved for medical use by the FDA, he bought the entire supply and is sending half of them to a doctor in the Bronx whose hospital has completely run out.
 “Why on God’s green earth can I go to Target and buy these items when so many hospitals are running out?” he asked. “If they are available at Target, there are certainly more sitting at a distribution center somewhere. We need these in our hospitals right now.”
 Several large hospital chains said they had adequate supplies for now, though they have taken steps to ration their use. The George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., has told heath care workers they can use a respirator mask five times before discarding it, and it is keeping its mask supply under lock and key.
 “We’ve experienced outright theft, with the general public walking into our building and walking right out,” said Bruno Petinaux, the hospital’s chief medical officer.
 Smaller hospitals and nonprofit clinics, especially those that lack centralized supply operations, are moving aggressively to conserve their gear. In an effort to save precious supplies, Chatham Hospital in Siler City, North Carolina, is only allowing one doctor and one nurse to examine patients with symptoms of respiratory distress.
 “We are practicing extreme PPE stewardship,” said Dr. Andy Hannapel, the chief medical officer.
 Some hospitals are employing more heavy-handed tactics. Saint Peter’s Healthcare System in New Jersey on Wednesday warned doctors in an email they could be disciplined for wearing masks when not examining patients.
 On Thursday, volunteers with knives, rulers and masking tape gathered at the headquarters of Providence St. Joseph Health to cobble together face shields for the system’s thousands of caregivers. In Oregon, health officials in Multnomah County are calling on the public to donate any rubber gloves, goggles or face masks they might have at home or work. The county, which includes Portland, has little more than a week before critical supplies run out.
 “Every pandemic is local so you have to pull on those local strings so we can help each other,” said Julie Sullivan-Springhetti, a Health Department spokesperson.
 But with limited prospects for speedy government intervention, fear and anxiety continue to mount. In recent days, hundreds of medical workers have taken to social media with public pleas for help using the hashtag #GetMePPE.
 A doctor at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, who requested anonymity, described how she and her colleagues on Tuesday intubated a trauma patient they later discovered was likely infected with COVID-19. All of them wore simple face masks as they worked just inches from the patient’s face.
 “I’m terrified,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she ended her shift. “I feel like it’s only a matter of time before I’m infected with this illness.”
