"Tigers teach us so many attributes that are applicable towards shaping our personalities, and I often take inspiration for their agility and fierceness in several aspects of my life. As part of this initiative, I tried to depict and imbibe the nature, kindness and ferocity of the beast through Kalaripayattu," Jammwal said.   "Saving the tiger population is certainly the need of the hour - its survival and presence play a crucial role in the sustenance, balance and well-being of the ecosystem. It is our duty to conserve their habitat and help increase the number of wild tigers in any way we can. I feel honoured to be associated with Animal Planet to promote such an important cause," he added.   On Jammawal's joining the noble cause, Megha Tata of Discovery is hopeful that it will encourage others to contribute towards the cause.   "We remain committed in our efforts of spreading awareness and conserving the wildlife. Project CAT is our effort towards the global goal of doubling the number of tigers in the wild by 2022. We are confident that Vidyut Jammwal's strong support for this noble initiative will help more people to join us and encourage them to contribute towards the cause," said, Megha Tata, Managing Director - South Asia, Discovery.   Launched in 2016, Project C.A.T. supports Discovery's global effort to double the wild tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger. By conserving nearly six million acres of protected land including India and Bhutan among other countries, this initiative, in collaboration with WWF and others, aims to ensure a healthy habitat for tigers. Discovery has further increased the ambit of Project C.A.T. by extending support for Tiger conservation initiatives in Sundarbans forest located in the coastal region of Bay of Bengal. (ANI)

"The treatment meted out to her husband amounts to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and amounts to a form of punishment not permitted by law, and entitled him to immediately be set at liberty by the apex court in the exercise of his right to life and liberty," it added.   The plea alleged that when Varavara Rao was hospitalised on May 27, 2020, he was hurriedly discharged on June 6 while his bail plea on the ground of his medical problems and COVID-19 was pending, only to avoid judicial determination of his bail on medical grounds.   Given the present medical condition and the fact that Rao is aged about 81 years, the question that would arise is whether the jail would have the necessary facilities to take care of her husband, the plea said.   The petition also mentioned that when her husband was arrested on August 28, 2018, he had no neurological problems, adding that it is therefore highly likely that COVID-19 and the fall that he had in St George hospital has led to neurological problems as reflected in the medical report filed by Nanavati Hospital July 30, 2020.   Even the report submitted by the Nanavati Hospital states that Rao requires monitoring and after he was discharged and to date, it is known through his communication with her and from the co-accused attendants that his health condition continues to be precarious, the plea said.   "The chance of commencement of trial in the immediate future is bleak and charges are yet to be framed... The investigation is still continuing and chargesheet running into 10,000 pages against seven accused who are arrested after the National Investigation Agency took over the investigation. There is no bar to grant bail on health grounds under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act or the National Investigation Act," it added.   The plea said in any event Dr Varavara Rao is in no position to stand trial in his present condition and needs critical medical care to keep him alive and hence no useful purpose is being served by his continued incarceration except to torture him beyond human endurance.   All bail applications are by definition urgent and ought to be given priority in hearing by all judicial authorities especially in the time of COVID 19, the plea said. (ANI)
