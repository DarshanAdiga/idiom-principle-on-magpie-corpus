During the quarter, as we ramped up our efforts to support small businesses across our footprint, we rapidly processed and funded more than 15,000 PPP loans with an average loan size of $134,000. In addition, our home lending department had a record-breaking quarter, generating more than $2.1 billion in production," said Cort O'Haver, president and CEO of Umpqua Holdings Corporation. "We continue working with customers who qualify for payment deferrals as a result of COVID-19 impacts with a 5.7% deferral level that reflects the company's strong credit quality practices. I'm especially pleased with the reduction in our cost of interest bearing deposits and lower non-interest expenses, absent increased home lending commissions due to volume, as we operate in a low interest rate environment."

California native and longtime Boston musician Laura Cortese - frontwoman for the acoustic string-driven band Laura Cortese & the Dance Cards - is in the midst of celebrating the new album "Bitter Better" from Belgium, where she's also in the process of becoming a Belgian citizen.
 Though Cortese built up her name as a fiddler and singer of traditional Scottish music, "Bitter Better," which was recorded in April, 2019 - in Belgium - and released last week on Compass Records, veers off into more pop and rock directions than any of the band's previous recordings.
 But first, a little background on what Cortese is doing in the small European country and why the record was made there.
 "I knew that I wasn't going to stay in Boston forever, and I realized that I really enjoyed my life whenever I happened to be in Europe," she said from her home in Ghent, which she shares with the Belgian chromatic button accordionist Bert Ruymbeek, whose band Wor puts a contemporary twist on 18th century compositions. "I decided to spend as much time as I could in Europe, both on tour and off. During one tour, we played at the Shetland Folk Festival, and I met Bert, who was also playing there, on the 14-hour ferry ride home. He and I stayed up all night talking and watching the sun rise and kind of extending the magic of the weekend. Six months later we were still corresponding, and I went to visit him in Ghent. It turned into a solid relationship, and now I'm living here, and I'm a bunch of months pregnant."
 She's also reached the status of becoming a Belgian resident, but not yet a citizen.
 "You have the option here of being married or being domestic partners," she explained. "So, we went the domestic partners route. Then you file a family reunification visa. You have to be here for six months, without leaving. We also had to establish that we had been a couple for two years, and had spent 'three times 45 days' in the same place. And I had to take language courses in Dutch and an integration exam. All of that gets you a residency. After you've been a resident for three years, you can apply for citizenship. I'll eventually have dual citizenship in Belgium and the U.S."
 Which all leads to why "Bitter Better" was recorded there, rather than here.
 "It was because I had to be here, and not leave, to get my residency," she said. "I had decided that it was time to record a new album, and I realized if I was going to have to be in one place for six months, that was kind of perfect. Because in order to do the writing and come up with thoughtful arrangements, it was nice to have downtime. Otherwise I would be doing it between tours."
 The first order of business for Cortese was to figure out what sort of music she wanted to be on the album.
 "I had a bunch of songs written, and I had some partial songs," she said. "Before I started my six months here, Sam Kassirer, who had produced our previous album, and I met up to discuss what would guide this album and how it would come together. In the end, everyone in the band was able to come to Belgium, and was able to participate in arranging and in cowriting the songs. We were in Belgium together, in a studio, sleeping in one house."
 The resulting album features quite a compendium of styles. It kicks off with the rocker "Treat You Better" and ends with the feel-good song "Daylight."
 Asked if it was planned from the get-go to open and close with those songs, Cortese said, "On this album, those decisions were not made early. There were a lot of variations of ways that the album could unfold, but I feel good about where we ended up."
 She explained that "From the Ashes" is an autobiographical piece that came to her during a band tour through California in 2017, just after the Tubbs fires, which destroyed many homes.
 "Here we were, in the state where I grew up, driving through the area where it happened, and watching the people there rebuild their lives," she said quietly. "Their resilience was just so inspiring."
 She's less open regarding the funny song "Corduroy Jacket," which addresses a fellow without much fashion sense. Is it actually about someone she knows?
 "That's a secret.," she said, laughing. "It's many people, obviously, but there's one person, where I got the first nugget of the song. I saw him and the line 'Why do you always wear that corduroy jacket, it don't look good with your eyes' popped into my head."
 Other directions the album heads in include the poppy and partially electronic "Where the Fox Hides" and the complex, ever-changing arrangement of the harmony-filled "Talk to Me."
 In the time since the album was completed and now, Cortese had been sitting in with other musicians in Belgium, cofounded the Bright Lights Sessions - sort of the Belgian equivalent of Sub Rosa, the Rose Polenzani shows at the Lizard Lounge - went to folk-related jams, and hung out with Ruymbeek. She even did a show with the Dance Cards in Ghent a couple of years ago.
 Since COVID-19 hit and put a temporary end to live shows, she's been doing occasional broadcasts from her living room.
 "But a few months ago, I invited a friend who's a videographer to record me doing four songs - outside of my house. Assuming all of the regulations stay as they are now, we'll be doing a multi-camera live broadcast on Aug. 1, with musician friends I've made in Belgium - not the Dance Cards - to celebrate the release of the album. It will probably be on my Facebook account."
