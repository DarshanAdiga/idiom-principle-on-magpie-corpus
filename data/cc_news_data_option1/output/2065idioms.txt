There is a long way to go before hotel REITs like Apple are seeing anywhere near normal business levels. And it goes beyond just occupancy; STR also noted that average room rates were nearly 75% below year-ago levels. Yes, there are solid signs that the worst is over, but a full recovery still appears to be a long way off. In fact, most investors would probably be better off sitting on the sidelines until more-material progress has been made.

It was a relatively safe Memorial Day weekend on the waters of East Central Alabama.
 Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Marine Patrol Lt. Mark Fuller said there were no boating fatalities in two accidents and no citations issued for boating under the influence on Lakes Martin, Jordan, Mitchel land Harding, the Alabama River and other waterways making up the region known to ALEA Marine Patrol as Troop D.
 Fuller said troopers issued 13 citations for minors in possession of alcohol.
 Marine patrol also responded to an injury at Acapulco Rock, more commonly known as Chimney Rock, on Lake Martin.
 “A 57-year-old male was injured jumping from Chimney Rock and flown to a local hospital,” Fuller said.
 Chimney Rock is a bare cliff face many jump from into the waters of Lake Martin as boaters gather in the river channel to watch and socialize. Several injuries have occurred there over the years.
 The man’s status was not known as of press time Tuesday but Fuller said Sunday the injuries were not life-threatening.
 Across the state several drownings were reported. Two drownings have occurred in the last week at Little River Canyon according to the National Park Service as swimmers took to the waterfalls and nearby pools as waterflow was increased by recent rains.
 Two men drowned and the third is in critical condition after swimming in Alabama’s gulf waters over the weekend.
 Fuller said the death of Tallassee resident Anthony Thornton, 34, is classified as a non-boating fatality. Thornton’s death remains under investigation by the Tallapoosa County Sheriff’s Department. Authorities are waiting on the results of an autopsy to aid in the investigation.
 Other citations from Memorial Day weekend include
 • Four careless operations citations were issued in the region
 • Four citations for emergency shut-off violations
 • Two citations for insufficient personal flotation devices (PFD)
 • One citation for towing a skier without a mirror or observer
 • One citation for improper navigation lights
 • Two citations for violations of restrictive sign or buoy
 • Five citations for no operator licenses
 • One citation for speeding
 • One citation for following too close
 • One citation for skiing without PFD
 • One citation for no vehicle drivers license
 • One citation for no PFD while operating a personal watercraft

Attitudes about the present situation dropped by 1.9 points to 71.1, the lowest since 2013, as the proportion rating business conditions as bad rose to the highest since 1983.
 The data add to signs that the worst of the fallout from the coronavirus is over, though there is still some way to go until the economy is back on track. While states are letting businesses reopen, confidence will be highly dependent on how well the coronavirus is contained and whether there’s a second wave of infections.

Amazon has made a few notable investments in recent years seemingly outside of its realm as a massive online retailer and technology company. When it comes to the auto industry, investment in the EV startup Rivian is the most notable example, and we learned the two had hatched plans for a purpose-built delivery van.
 Now, it looks like Amazon has its eyes on self-driving technology. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the online retailer is in talks to purchase self- driving technology startup Zoox for somewhere in the ballpark of $3.2 billion. The purchase would further solidify a strategy to potentially bring delivery services totally in-house. In the process, financial analysts suspect it could keep FedEx, UPS and other tech companies working on autonomous vehicle technology on their toes.
 Essentially, Amazon could sell goods and deliver them with a self-driving vehicle. Shipping costs would plummet, and Amazon could skip hiring human drivers to save additional cash. Of course, there are no self-driving vehicles on sale today, and there won't be tomorrow, either. It could be a massive bet on technology that hasn't come to fruition nearly as quickly as many once expected. Zoox originally planned for a totally driverless car by this year. Other rivals also looked at 2020 as a turning point for deploying autonomous ride-hailing services, though Alphabet's Waymo is the only company to have come close to a widespread, public option.
 Zoox declined to comment on the potential purchase. Amazon did not immediately return Roadshow's request for comment.

PLAIN CITY — Plain City ranked as the fastest-growing city in Weber County between 2018 and 2019 and sixth-fastest across the state.
 It doesn’t come as a surprise to Jon Beesley, the city’s mayor, though.
 “This has happened for quite some time and I don’t see it slowing down,” he said. There’s a lot of open land around the city, he continued, and until it fills up “we’re going to continue to see that growth pattern.”
 Mike Gailey, the mayor of Syracuse — one of the fastest-growing cities last year in Davis County — sounded a similar message. “We build a new home a day. We have seen that for years,” he said.
 Growth is the norm in Weber and Davis counties, as it is and has been all along the Wasatch Front, and new U.S. Census Bureau population estimates confirm that the trend continues. Likewise, the debate rages on — how, if at all possible, do you balance the influx of people and worries of some that the growth undermines the unique charms of smaller locales, that it’s tantamount, essentially, to suburban sprawl?

When Holy Cross moved to distance learning in mid-March because of the coronavirus crisis, HC students and siblings Paul and Mary Anne Wiley returned to their home in Bow, New Hampshire, and had a week off from classes while the college finalized its virtual platform.
 "We're sitting at home," said Mary Anne, a rising junior. "We can't go outside; we can't see our friends. 'What are we going to do?' "
 Paul, who graduated from Holy Cross on Friday, and their cousin Luke Knox of Falmouth, who is also a rising junior at HC, before the pandemic had already developed a long-lasting hand sanitizer through their company, Wilox (a combination of their last names). These young innovators and entrepreneurs, inspired by their parents, who are health care workers, and realizing the shortage of personal protective equipment, quickly turned to their next project, making face shields.
 "We saw how coronavirus affects the health care industry," said Knox, whose father is a cardiovascular surgeon at Cape Cod Healthcare. "Early on in March, we got cookies for some of my dad's employees. We didn't go inside, but when we drove up to the hospital, you could feel itin the air how nervous people were, how frightened people were, and we thought, 'This isn't right. People shouldn't be afraid.' That's where we drew our biggest motivation.
 "We said, 'We want to help people. We feel like we can. Let's start doing it,' " Knox said. "That's when we started making the face shields."
 Paul earned his degree in chemistry. Luke and Mary Anne are both majoring in economics. Paul and Mary Anne's younger brother, Matthew, who is a sophomore in high school, is also part of the Wilox team.
 One of Paul's first business ventures was making handcrafted pens - he won HC's Shark Tank competition as a freshman - and the Wileys have a laser engraver in their basement.
 "We wanted to make something health care workers could wear that was safe," Paul said, "and we wanted to make it well. Having experience in manufacturing making handcrafted pens, we decided we can make face shields."
 They ordered some clear plastic sheets and went to work. The Wileys had their parents, Jeff, a record-breaking Holy Cross quarterback and member of the HC Varsity Club Hall of Fame who is an orthopedic surgeon at Concord (N.H.) Hospital, and Kathleen, who is a nurse practitioner at Concord Hospital, try it out.
 "It had a skinny hard plastic that came across your forehead and it bumped out so that it would cause the face shield to sit away from your face," Mary Anne said. "Our parents were like, 'This is so uncomfortable,' so it was back to the drawing board."
 They came up with shields constructed of see-through plastic with a skin- friendly foam bumper (Jeff suggested foam for the forehead piece) and adjustable Velcro straps, and donated 40 of them to Concord Hospital.
 "Originally we just wanted to help out the community," Mary Anne said. "Then we realized the demand."
 After their story was featured on a local TV station in New Hampshire, a dentist office messaged Mary Anne through social media and asked how to obtain their face shields.
 "We are now running through a few prototypes with dentists," Mary Anne said.
 While Paul was studying for finals a couple of weeks ago, 60 dental offices in New Hampshire reached out to him by phone or email.
 "They said, 'We need PPE in order to open. What do you have?' " Paul said. "It's crazy."
 "In addition to the face shields," Paul said, "through our supply chain with the pens, we were able to source other PPE - masks, gloves, gowns, alcohol wipes - for the dental offices."
 They have also had inquiries for face shields from restaurants, ice cream shops and other small businesses.
 Paul and Luke started a small hobby business before they got to college.
 "Once we got to Holy Cross," Paul said, "we wanted to do something that was bigger."
 They combined their last names to create Wilox and the research and development of the long-lasting hand sanitizer began. The Holy Cross biology department offered them a lab to do their research and HC also provided guidance on the business side, Paul said.
 The hand-sanitizer formula provides lasting protection for hours by binding to the epithelial cells on the hand. They are working with the New Jersey company Smart Common Sense, and Wilox is currently restocking the hand sanitizer on its web site (wiloxassets.com).
 The slogan Paul and Luke came up with for Wilox is "Innovations for today for a healthier tomorrow," and the vision, implementation and vivacity of the Wilox team members are playing a vital role during the coronavirus crisis.

"After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as US laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997. No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground," Pompeo said.
 In short, these developments place Hong Kong's status as a major financial hub up in the air. Pompeo's announcement also paves the way for the US to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.
 China's intention to impose the new national security law has been widely viewed as an attempt to discard Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" model, and has led to unrest in the city's streets in recent days. Thousands have protested the move, violating coronavirus social distancing rules in the process, and have been met with tear gas and water cannons by police.
 Tensions between the US and China have been high throughout President Donald Trump's tenure, but the relationship has become especially antagonistic amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has blamed the pandemic on China, where the virus originated. Some experts have warned that the two countries are on the brink of a new Cold War that could exacerbate the already devastating public health and economic consequences of the pandemic. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday echoed such concerns.

Nvidia sets the market. Recently, AMD seems content to sell their cards slightly lower than Nvidia's when the rasterized performance is equal with everything else ignored. That's not going to work when Ampere hits the market where all indications now are that ray tracing performance will be usable at least down to the mid range and maybe lower. If the 3070 is 30-40+% faster than a 2070 with very good raytracing performance at the $500 price point, no refresh of the 5700XT is going to get it in the ballpark, along with no ray tracing.

 Of course, as an AMD Radeon board, you don't get hardware ray-tracing support. Until AMD revises its RDNA graphics architecture later this year, that feature is exclusive to Nvidia RTX GPUs such as the RTX 2070 Super, or the 2080 Ti. But then ray tracing in actual games is currently very limited.
 What you do get is a very slick and quick card for conventional raster-based in-game graphics and a well featured board. Highlights include a beefy 2.7x width cooler with triple fans, the latter lubed up with space-grade lubricant sealed to IP5X dust-resistant standards, and all the usual refinements that come with every AMD Radeon 5700 XT board, including 2,560 stream processors, 160 texture units, 64 output units and a GPU based on the latest 7nm manufacturing technology.

The trunk lid looks stubby for good reason: it conceals a small trunk. Though a five-speed gearbox is standard, our mount was saddled with the optional three-speed automatic, its shifter jutting from the console. The five-speed promised better performance but the three-speed automatic was all that Mancuso could supply. Grappling with the weight, the automatic shuffles the Aston off the mark at full throttle, provides lethargic shift response, and revs up one gear shy of efficiency. Downshifts must often be forced manually because the transmission has a tendency to upshift early and suffers a reluctance to be prodded to life with the toe alone.

The car's bodywork, more inspiring in detail than in sum, highlights brilliant handiwork and paintwork. The blunt yet rounded breastworks lead the way to a decent Cd of 0.34. The lights see well down the road at night and look slick during the day. The side windows, less smoothly integrated, lead your gaze to dual fuel-filler flaps below the C-pillars. An interconnection allows you to add super unleaded to the huge 29.9-gallon tank from either flank.
 The V-8 looks almighty, but Aston pits it against the car's all mighty mass, a crushing 4349 pounds. But despite the car's size, Aston didn't interrupt the space between engine and fuel tank with much of a cabin. Despite the potential offered by the Virage's 186.8-inch overall length, 102.8-inch wheelbase, and 52.0-inch height, none of us fit well. We couldn't find a compromise that included a handy reach to the distant wheel, kneeroom unencumbered by the low dash, and a full view of both the tachometer and speedometer. Too bad, because the front seats hold up their end--and yours--in fine style. The rear "seats," however, feel like baby benches sunk into a wishing well, making us wish for more romper room. Even petite women find that extracting themselves from the rear requires a stump puller, total immodesty, and the Corps of Engineers. We can't call the Virage a two-plus-two--it's more like a two-plus-two half- pints. But the leather, stitching, padding, and wood show high quality. A suede headliner compels people to touch it. Connolly-leather seats and black piping offset burl-walnut trim. Faults include a slab-like dash layout that stacks massive façades of leather, plastic, and wood; lumpy screws that secure the fuse-panel; and visors that loom too low.

Isn’t it amazing how easily we humans are led into things? And we thought sheep were easily fooled?
 Have you seen any businesses close that you know won’t be able to re-open ever? I have. And I was sure they were rock-solid. Did you ever think you’d see the grocery store shelves and meat cases empty, or give any thought to the possibility of all restaurants and businesses being completely stopped? What a difference a month or two can make in a world that thought everything was good.
 In recent weeks I’ve heard of farmers and ranchers dumping thousands of gallons of milk and just as many eggs, while grocery store shelves were empty. Why?? Because our food pipeline runs right thru the middle of bureaucracy and red tape. Little producers have been forced out of business, not by the “big guys” but by you and me. Producers who bought into the CAFO (look it up) way of doing things, also began to take payments to keep their prices low, with guaranteed sales to grocery chains … who sold the goods to mainstream America for price that didn’t tell the truth about how much it costs to produce! We, the “chasers of bargains” bought it, hook-line-and-sinker. The little guys couldn’t sell for the drastically reduced prices and stay afloat when we quit buying his stuff. We sunk the Mom & Pop, you and me.
 At the 2019 Regenerative Agriculture Summit in September, I was privileged to listen to and meet some men who are trying hard to teach a better way to farm, to be self-sustaining, and to be profitable. There was another business there that I’d really never given much thought to. It was called Barn2Door (barn2door.com). Not being a for-profit farmer I really didn’t pay a lot of attention except to find out what they do, which is connect the farmer/producer with the client/consumer, allowing direct purchasing of goods.
 I see such validity for people like this today. No matter what you’re looking for —meat, eggs, dairy, produce — the connection and relationship you have is with the persons who produced it. No profiteer in the middle. No shipping unripe food. No excess packaging. What a concept!
 This same process can be seen in our communities, if we will but use it. There are very few necessary consumables, and some that aren’t so necessary, that can’t be had with a little effort. Our county is covered with farmers! There are farm stands, U-pick farms, orchards, bee-keepers, and people selling eggs. There are even meat-growers that sell “shares” in an animal, so you don’t have to buy an entire carcass. I know some of the meat-growers and appreciate their “best practices” and respect they have for their product.
 We’re also very fortunate to have two farmer’s markets here in Greene Co. The oldest one is the Greeneville Farmers Market, which sets up at the Doak House Museum on Saturdays. They also have an on-line ordering site. The other is the Depot Street Farmers Market, which gathers on Saturday, at the corner of Depot and Irish. They also have an on-line ordering. Both places will have abundant fresh local goods. If you have good s to sell and need a venue, please contact these markets.
 There are some fed up, frustrated independent producers who have taken the bull by the horns, in order to crack the brick wall they all face in trying to raise healthy product and make ends meet. Two such movements are the Food Freedom Act — check out Wyoming’s version — and Food Sovereignty Laws, such as Maine’s 2011 version. These enactments are allowing local governments ways to by-pass impossible regulations, so farmers can sell directly to consumers in their communities.
 Did you know that there’s a non-profit trying to fight the legal battle? It’s called the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund.
 One more tip. Go to HealthyTraditions.com to learn more about buying your meat in "shares."
 We can, and must, understand how, why, where and who when it comes to this precious life-sustainer. We either learn how to get along, share, give, and defend our food sources, our water, and our air or … who knows? And I don’t really want to find out. No, things probably won’t ever be the way they were, and I’m ok with that. Especially if it means that we humans figure out that we really do need each other.

It checks off clichés one by one, seemingly just to get them out of the way and, on some occasions, smartly subverts them.

When a business owner began preparing to re-open for business last week but didn't know where to turn to get specific answers on how to do so safely, he turned to the county.
   
 "His question was as simple as, 'What if one of my employee tests positive?'" said Kerri Melton, assistant Cleveland County manager. "From that idea, we created a task force."
   
 Out of this taskforce, a unique program was created that gives both business owners and their customers reassurance during uncertain times.
   
 You Can Count On Us Cleveland County is a voluntary program developed by Cleveland County Government and designed to ensure participating local businesses and organizations are equipped to deliver the highest standards of public health and safety in order to comply with federal, state and local guidance during the reopening process.
   
 As North Carolina enters phase two of a gradual reopening plan that eases restrictions put into place because of COVID-19, many local business owners are seeking guidance on how to do so in a responsible and safe manner.
   
 Melton said people from all different sectors were invited to a brainstorming session last week where they tackled questions, such as "what keeps you up at night?" and "What is a way the county can help?"
   
 "We invited people from all different sectors - barber shops, hair salons, gyms, educational institutions, representatives from the faith based community, the Chamber of Commerce to represent businesses and a restaurant," Melton said. "We had the Health Department and County Administration represented."
   
 According to the county's Facebook page, anyone who wanted to become a "Certified Reopen Cleveland County Responsibly Establishment" could sign up with a link that was provided in the post.
   
 Once an owner signs up to participate, they are added to a list.
   
 Thursday afternoon, all of those who signed up were invited to attend a drive- through event at the Legrand Center where packets of information were distributed along with a limited number of masks and cleaning supplies, and each one was given a logo to display.
   
 "Our hope is that, when our citizens and visitors see the You Can Count on Us logo, they see that business took the time to read the guidance recommended for safe reopening," Melton said. "We know that our county is stronger when we collaborate. We want to work with our businesses so they are equipped to deliver the highest standards of public health and safety during the reopening process."
   
 Melton said a little over 100 businesses had signed up as of Wednesday afternoon.
   
 "There's so much information out there right now and people are struggling to decipher it all," she said. "Our goal is to make it easy to get access to it and understand."
   
 She said as new guidelines and recommendations are released, the county will be able to keep local establishments up to date through the listserv.
   
 "Our goal is to then do the same thing for places of worship and day camps and do this several times as we open back up," Melton said.

Anderson was not shot, but was seriously injured by scrap metal. He spent six weeks in the hospital at Johnson Air Force Base in Japan. Then he was reassigned back to Vietnam. He had already spent 13 months in Vietnam. He would go on to serve nine more months in the rank of sergeant.
 “I was released in September in 1966,” he said. “I was fully discharged in 1969.”
 That same year, he married his wife Darlene. They had a daughter, Trina, and they now have four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
 Anderson went to work for the Rigby Police Department, serving for 42 years, 34 as Chief of Police. He retired in 2011.
 He believes his service in Vietnam prepared him to work as Chief of Police.
 “Things didn’t bother me that would have bothered other people,” he said. “People in the city of Rigby are great people. It’s a small community but bigger since I first started.”
 In the military he learned about discipline, and how hard work leads to accomplishment.
 “I think it also made me grow up. I was just a boy from Idaho and all of a sudden I was a soldier. It made me respect what freedoms we do have. People complain but let them go to another country and they’ll come back and appreciate what they’ve got,” he said.
 Learning to handle the unexpected also translated well to police work.
 “Somebody told me once you get used to adrenaline. You don’t know one moment to the next what is happening,” he said.
 Another thing gained from the military was making lifelong friends. He’s drawn even closer to some of his friends who got drafted, he said.
 “A lot depends on the guy next to you doing his job and he depends on you doing your job,” he said. “When I first came back, a lot of people didn’t want anything to do with us,” Anderson said. “Through the years and everything has folded back. ‘I guess those guys aren’t so bad.’ I think a lot of people accepted it. You can’t let things like that get the better of you. I learned to live with it.”
 And now he enjoys being a member of the America Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, he said.
 He also enjoys travelling to places such as England, Scotland, Mexico, Holland, Alaska and Hawaii; taking his camper to Heise in the summer, and riding his side-by-side.
 “Doing all kinds of different things,” he said. “Basically all that we weren’t able to find the time to do before.”

The Governor was a fine _Walking Dead_ villain, but he was never going to stick around for the long run (hi, Negan). David Morrissey's character signed his own death warrant by killing Hershel in cold blood, throwing Rick's tentative offer of cooperation out the window in the process (see above). Our survivors and The Governor's people then engage in a bloody battle that ultimately spells the end for both the eye patch-wearing antagonist and the claustrophobic prison setting — but what a way for both to bow out.

If you sit at the kitchen table in the firehouse long enough, the conversation will eventually become about family. Stories of bravery or amusing pranks will be interlaced with the relationships to the subject of the stories.
 In the past, it was always someone’s father, uncle, or brother. Today it is quite common to hear about someone’s mother, aunt, or sister in the fire service. In the Sunnyside Volunteer Fire Department, it is husband and wife Chief Jeremiah and Treasurer Misty Taylor.
 At 41-years-old Jeremiah is a third generation firefighter with the family tradition going back to his grandfather being part of the original Tusculum fire brigade, while working maintenance at Tusculum College. His father was also a firefighter and a member of the Greeneville Emergency and Rescue Squad. Jeremiah “always being around it” made it a logical step when he turned 18 to join the Newmansville Volunteer Fire Department where he served as a firefighter and a Lieutenant.
 He went on to serve with Nolichucky, and Tusculum volunteer fire departments before joining Sunnyside Volunteer Fire Department, serving as Secretary, Lieutenant, Training Captain, and Chief.
 While serving in the fire service Jeremiah also was a member of the Greeneville Emergency and Rescue Squad where he was a full-time member for eight years and has been a lifetime member for two years.
 Misty, also 41, had a different path in emergency services. The events of 9/11 motivated her to serve but in more of a “behind the scenes” position versus frontline fire service. That desire to serve lead to a career as an emergency dispatcher at Greene County 911 for the past 17 years.
 Misty’s transition to the “frontline” came about with her relationship with Jeremiah and joining the Sunnyside department five years ago where she has gone on to become a certified exterior firefighter and has served as treasurer for the past three years.
 Her experience as a firefighter gives Misty better situational awareness when working at 911. Understanding what command at the fire scene is dealing with can help with the smoother flow of communications between the fire scene command and 911, making her a better dispatcher.
 What if it is Jeremiah on the other end of the radio, does that make it more personal? Both Jeremiah and Misty were quick to respond, “Hearing each other on the radio does provide reassurance that each other are ok.”
 That reassurance only goes so far. The worry is there every time for Misty as the hardest part of her job is not knowing if Jeremiah, her husband of five years, is coming home after a call or not. When asked how they handle this as a couple Jeremiah says it is not something he thinks about when leaving for a call, “because the fear could keep him from performing the way he should.” While Jeremiah is keeping his head in the game on the call, Misty gains comfort hearing other experienced firefighters radio in responding, as well as neighboring departments in mutual aid.
 The difficult times are not just over the radio but after the calls as well. There are the bad calls that come with the territory. But there is also the time away from home and the kids because of calls, training, station management, and Misty’s rotating schedule at 911. Many weeks the only time Misty and Jeremiah get to see each other is a few hours to sit down at the station to go over the budget or station activities.
 The positive reasons to serve, however, outweigh the stresses. For Misty, being a role model is very satisfying, like the time a “little girl recognized that girls can be firefighters too” or her kids being proud of her for earning her position as a firefighter. But she is also proud of the work she does at the station. She likes to set goals and see them accomplished, like making sure the department has the funding. Seeing the department member’s “faces light up” when she tells them they have the money needed to buy equipment makes it worthwhile.
 For Jeremiah, there is the rush of fighting a fire but the older he gets, he says, “It’s the sense of duty and service.” He was not able to serve in the military, so this is his service. “It’s hard to do, working two jobs but he takes pride in doing this and giving back to the community.
 That sense of duty and service provided the drive to the position of Chief, which is what he is most proud of. The fact “the membership is putting their trust in me to lead them and carry them into the future” is humbling. It is also not easy. Being Chief is hard work and not always fun. When something goes wrong, “you are the guy everyone looks for.” But it is a role he accepted and he will be there for his members or any other responder.
 While they have their individual goals for their positions, Jeremiah and Misty’s joint goal as department officers is the family environment of the Sunnyside department. Misty wants to see more women involved as, “they can be the glue to the departments.”
 “If the wives are not comfortable the members are not going to be here,” she says. She wants them to be family-oriented, for the kids to play together and husbands to talk and work with each other.
 Under Jeremiah’s leadership the department equipped their brushfire truck with a new skid unit, obtained new air packs, and recently upgraded their tanker truck. While Jeremiah is thankful for the foundation the past members and Chiefs put in place, he now sees his job as how he can best train, equip and motivate the department family into the future to be of service to the Sunnyside community.

This Hubbard/Riley/Canary triumvirate is forever gone from Goat Hill. There is still a lingering perception that Riley is still calling shots from the sidelines of today’s political campaigns and world. Folks, that is a misnomer. As a lobbyist, Riley is able to get some campaign money for certain candidates from his friends and benefactors, the Indian gambling interests. However, his influence in state politics is insignificant. He is not the power behind the throne how it is sometimes perceived. There were whispers that he had influence and even control over the State Supreme Court. This Hubbard decision dispels that myth.
 As unsavory as Canary had become, the breath of fresh air brought to the BCA by Katie Britt is significant to say the least, if not monumental. Britt, the young, vibrant CEO of the BCA exudes not only energy but also vast integrity and openness. She is twice as smart as most people on the block and 10 times more honest and upfront with folks. She projects an image that makes business folks in Alabama proud to be a part of our state government.
 Britt revealed brilliant leadership recently when she initiated and orchestrated a BCA telethon on Alabama Public Television. There were volunteer lawyers, accountants and other experts on the phone answering questions about how to apply for federal programs in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. The Gov. Kay Ivey, Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth and Attorney General Steve Marshall appeared as guests on the show. Also appearing was the legendary leader of the National Federation of Small Businesses in the state, Rosemary Elebash, who has been a brilliant, hard-working leader for Alabama’s small business owners for decades.
 See you next week.

At the end of the day, I think the goal is inner peace and happiness. Throughout the past few weeks of training my mind to be calm and clear, I have come away with not only an improved ability to be still-minded (this is cool!), but a heightened sense of self and productivity driven by motivation rather than by stress. This may or may not be your goal, and it wasn’t necessarily mine, but I went in with an open (and moving) mind, and I am continuing to see the benefits of slowing down, if only for a few minutes, with that much more peace as I go.
