The Washington County elections office has also sent letters to judges of election asking that they contact members of their local election board and report the status of those who have served previously by Sept. 11.
 Because voter turnout is always highest in a presidential election year, each of the county’s 180 precincts needs five poll workers, and larger precincts can increase the size of their boards to seven.
 All judges of elections and at least one other poll worker from a local board must attend a training class.
 Those attending will be compensated for mileage plus $10 for taking the class, which will be limited to 25 people. Face masks are required under current guidelines set by both the federal Centers for Disease Control and Pennsylvania.
 Poll worker training in the public meeting room on the first floor of the Courthouse Square office building will resume Sept. 16 through Oct. 23. There will be 12 sessions in September and eight sessions in October. Sessions on various days will begin at either 11 a.m., 1 p.m. or 5 p.m.
 The elections office is also working with local high schools to find students who are willing to help at polling places.
 Those who are interested in working on Election Day should call 724-228-6750 or email washcoelections@co.washington.pa.us.

If Ferguson and Poirier do collide later this year the winner could easily find their way back to a title shot opportunity. Both men are former interim champions and compelling story lines could be developed depending on what ends up happening between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Justin Gaethje and UFC 254.

"I know what it is like, I'm from Lagos, Nigeria, so I know what it is like in certain countries where money talks. Where, if you flash your gun, people act a certain way, I know what it is like. You have heard stories with Brazil about people going to gyms to test people and they are not complying because of certain things. I know what that is like, but, I don't mind. I just like to bring that up because I want it to be known, I said on record, I will pop him before USADA pops him. So, I'm going to beat him and when he gets popped by USADA down the line, it will be like yup, I still whooped his ass even when he was on steroids. That will make a great story."

Firefighters are having to prioritise which fires to fight, with state resources stretched to a capacity not seen before.
 Help is being sent from other areas of the country but teams on their way from Texas, for example, face a two to three day journey by road before they arrive. There is not nearly enough manpower to combat the enormity of these fires.
 David Janssen spoke to me from Mines Canyon Road where a fire more than 340,000 acres in size is only 10% under control.
 "We've got a lot of out-of-state resources coming and they're being split up among all the fires just to make sure we can get a handle on this. I'll be probably be here for the next month."
 The fires were started by a rare lightning storm last weekend - thousands of strikes igniting more than 600 wildfires.
 High winds and high temperatures have since created three infernos which surround San Francisco Bay.
 One saving grace is much of the area on fire is rural grassland but one officer told me it has been "a white knuckle" couple of days.
 Weather warnings and the unpredictable nature of the fires meant the flames could easily have spread to the more populated areas of Silicon Valley. That immediate threat appears to have passed for now but it could be weeks before these fires are brought anywhere near under control.

Not everyone needs a computer with a full set of bells and whistles. A Chromebook’s simplified interface makes it popular with schools—and those of us who serve as IT support for less tech-savvy relatives. It can cost less than a budget PC, too.
 You might not even need to spend anything if you have an older laptop already lying about. Installing the equivalent of Chrome OS onto aged hardware takes less than an hour’s worth of elbow grease, and the final result often feels snappier than today’s dirt-cheap Chromebooks.
 Here’s how to do it.

Like Chrome OS, CloudReady’s system requirements are very minimal. The laptop must have 2GB RAM, 16GB storage, full BIOS access, and ideally been manufactured after 2007. You will still need to check your CPU model, though, as Neverware says that processors with Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) 500, 600, 3600, or 3650 graphics hardware don’t meet CloudReady’s performance standards. (In other words, Atom processors from the Silverthorne, Lincroft, and Cedarview families, which were found in low-end laptops between 2008 and early 2012.)
 Your best-case scenario is to find your laptop on Neverware’s list of certified devices, which clearly outlines support for features like a webcam or touchscreen. (Click on the model’s name to see those details.) We lucked out that our test model, a 2013 Lenovo ThinkPad X240, had full feature support across the board.
