India has reported 46,964 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, in a sign of continued downward trend in infections. The Health Ministry on Sunday also registered 470 additional deaths, taking total fatalities up to 122,111. The latest figures take the country's total virus tally to close to 8.2 million, behind only the U.S. India saw a steep rise in cases in July and added more than 2 million in August and another 3 million in September. But it is seeing a slower pace since mid-September, when daily infections touched a record of 97,894 with the highest number of deaths at 1,275. According to the Health Ministry, more than 7.4 million Indians have recovered from COVID-19. Some experts say the decline in cases suggests that the virus may have finally reached a plateau in India but others question the testing methods and warn that a major festival as well as the winter season could result in new outbreaks.

WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party is something few could have imagined when he launched what seemed an unlikely bid for the 2016 nomination.


  But even if Trump loses reelection Tuesday, his grip on the GOP is now strong enough that it could take some time before the party figures out a path forward.


  "I do not think this is a party that is ready to grapple with what it's been doing or reassess itself anytime soon," said GOP consultant Brendan Buck, who worked for the past two Republican House speakers and does not support Trump.


  Trump's takeover of the GOP was swift. While he was front and center during the 2016 primary debates, Trump was initially slow to consolidate support. Even as late as the convention, the possibility of a floor fight loomed over his nomination.


  Once Trump was elected, however, he reshaped the party in his image and GOP officeholders have been judged - by him and by voters - primarily on their loyalty to the president.


  "Until that changes," Buck said, "it's going to be hard to have a real conversation about changing who we are as a party."


  That's despite the fact that the headlines have been filled with former GOP officeholders who reject Trump - even as the party's base remains passionate about the president.


  Ninety-five percent of Republicans approve of how Trump is doing his job, a figure similar to George W. Bush's standing before his 2004 re-election, according to Gallup.


  But Trump has generally been viewed much less favorably than Bush was among independents and Democrats in the months leading up the election.


  Loss of older voters, women


  Some of the worst erosion has been among older voters, those with a college education and women.


  Such changes could force a long-term political realignment, according to William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Clinton administration. Voters who are breaking their ties with the GOP to back Democratic challenger Joe Biden could make a temporary move permanent if they like what they see in a Biden presidency.


  "This could be an extremely significant election in that regard because that would mean a shift in the plate tectonics of politics in the United States," Galston said. "This could be a big one."


  One group of former Republicans who are giving up on reshaping the party is the Lincoln Project, which has run some of the toughest ads against Trump as well as gone after Senate Republicans on the ballot.


  "There are a lot of folks who might be very interested in rebuilding the Republican Party," said Reed Galen, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project who worked for President George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain. "We are not them."


  Galen sees the Lincoln Project as being a "coalition partner" with a Biden administration.


  "If you want to get the country healthy and back to work and back to school, it's going to take a broad-based, bipartisan, nationwide effort to make it happen," he said. "To the extent that we can be helpful to a President Biden in that regard, we want to do that."


  The Lincoln Project gleefully tweeted recently that its 2.6 million followers had surpassed the Republican National Committee's 2.5 million.


  To Republicans like Buck, that just proves the group won't have a voice at the conservative table.


  "I think they are a bunch of guys who are effectively leading a Democratic political organization and their followers are Democrats who are happy to see them take out Republicans for them," he said.


  Can Trump supporters and Never Trumpers co-exist?


  In fact, it's not clear whether conservatives who have pushed back against Trump and the changes he's brought to the party are a significant force, said Vanessa Williamson, co-author of "The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism."


  "The question I think that remains open is how much support those individuals have either institutionally or in terms of voter support," Williamson said during a recent discussion at the Brookings Institution, where she is a senior fellow. "It is not, I think, at the level where I would describe it as a faction, even, for the Republican Party, in terms of its level of organization or power within the party."


  At the conservative American Enterprise Institute, scholar Yuval Levin has been bringing together policy advisers to politicians to discuss how to change what conservatives are offering voters.


  Levin, who worked on domestic policy for Bush, was among those arguing "well before Trumpism" that base tenants of Reaganism - lowering taxes and letting market forces rule - that drove the party for many years are not delivering for working families.


  "That's very much a debate within the right," he said. "I think that Republican politicians still are deeply perplexed about what happened in 2016."


  Similarly, a new think tank, the American Compass, is trying to make it clear that "post-Trumpism needs to be very different from pre-Trumpism."


  "Trump just proved wrong virtually everything that the right-of-center thought it knew about what its politicians were supposed to be saying, what it's constituents actually cared about," said executive director Oren Cass, a former adviser to Sen. Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.


  Cass argues conservative public policy became too dominated by libertarian impulses, a hands-off approach that has left a lot of needs unaddressed.


  "We see a much more substantial role for public policy to play in making the market work well," he said.


  A big tent?


  In order to recalibrate, Republicans will have to first wander in the wilderness, said Sarah Longwell, founder of Republicans for the Rule of Law and Defending Democracy Together.


  "It comes down to how tight a grip does Donald Trump retain on the party," she said. "Because one of the things that's really important to understand about Donald Trump is that he cares less about beating Democrats than he does about owning the Republican Party."


  For that reason, Longwell thinks voters have to "absolutely annihilate" Republicans on Nov. 3.


  But the groups she leads aren't actively working to defeat any Republicans except Trump, as the Lincoln Project is.


  For Defending Democracy Together's $30 million campaign aimed at giving Republicans the "permission" to vote against Trump through testimonials of Republicans who are doing just that, Longwell wanted as big a tent as possible.


  "Ninety percent of the people in our project explicitly endorse Biden and are probably going to vote straight ticket," she said. "But lots of others might not. And we wanted to have a project that gave everybody in that space a home."


  John Pudner, a former adviser to Romney who supports Trump, said the "Never Trumpers" lost credibility with rank-and-file Republicans when they started going after senators.


  "I just don't see how a conservative thinks we're better off with every branch being controlled by Democrats," he said.


  Tom Nichols, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, said it's laughable to argue that Republicans should keep the Senate to serve as a check-and-balance on Democrats, if they lose the White House.


  "I don't remember, over 40 years, anybody ever saying, `Now we're on the verge of a landslide…but we'd better leave some Democrats in power so that we don't go crazy," said Nichols, author of "The Death of Expertise."


  And since it's "pretty rare for parties to die," he said, the most likely future is some kind of reconstituted Republican Party.


  "But it needs to have new people in it," he added.


  Even if Trump loses, it's impossible to predict what things will feel like after Nov. 3, Levin said.


  But, soon enough, he said, "these conversations will be happening everywhere on the right."


  "I mean," Levin added, "it will be all we have to do."

We know that lightning exists on other worlds. Voyager 1 captured images of lightning storms on Jupiter’s night side in 1979. But while there was speculation that lightning storms on other planets could produce similar TLE’s as on Earth, we hadn’t yet observed them. When researchers reviewed Juno data over the last two years, several flashes in both visible and ultraviolet light suggested Juno had observed 11 sprites in Jupiter’s clouds. Differing from Earth, these sprites lasted a mere 1.4ms but were much larger from 500km to 2200km in diameter. They appeared 269km above 1 bar atmospheric pressure (equivalent to Earth’s atmospheric pressure at sea level so like Jupiter’s ‘surface’). The lightning strikes creating these sprites occur between clouds at lower altitudes comprised of both water and ammonia. However, while Earth’s atmosphere creates red sprites from Nitrogen, Jupiter’s sprites appear blue from the excitement of Hydrogen.

While lawyers, mainly from common law backgrounds, price judicial independence, and belief in it forms the core of our legal education, the realistic position is that judicial independence, in the sense that judges make decisions at all times without external control, regrettably, does not exist. whether in a democracy or in an autocracy, the triadic model that lawyers are taught to believe exists to ensure fairness and the just dispensation of justice at all times is illusive. This is because, courts are an important instrument of social control to regimes; and keeping them in line with the regimes’ core policies and interests is certainly very important to all regimes. If judges step out of line, their power could be reconfigured by the regime, using any one of the tools of control available to them, including court packing, withdrawal of jurisdiction, threats, violence, etc., so as to restore the regimes’ balance of control over the courts. In other words, courts will remain independent as long as they are, overall, beneficial (by way of support) to the regimes in their country, and not a threat to it. They will assist the regime where the exigencies of maintaining their power demands. Failure to do so will attract the wrath of the regime irrespective of what political system prevails.

If you use that number and do some exponential that country will be stretched so big to double its current size to 250 million before 2050. Egypt is also facing the same explosion.

Trump has made attacking the integrity of the nation's elections a central campaign theme. He has claimed without evidence that increased mail-in voting in light of the pandemic will be rife with fraud and that Democrats will "rig” the outcome in favor of his opponent.


  Several right-wing, militia and anti-government groups told Reuters they do not plan to police the polls, but will be on standby if chaos ensues after the election.


  Mike Dunn, a prominent member of the "boogaloo” anti-government movement in Virginia, said he and other "boogaloos” have no plans for Election Day. If disturbances erupt afterward, said 20-year old Dunn, his armed supporters will protect protesters from assailants, regardless of their political affiliation, and guard against looting. He emphasized that they would use peaceful tactics to de-escalate volatile situations.


  The presence of armed extremists at protests could escalate tensions, even if the groups do not intend it, several former law enforcement officials said.


  Chris Hill, the Georgia-based leader of the III% Security Force, said his militia group would defend property in the event of rioting and would focus on deterring violence and unrest. "I’m going to have my gear in my truck and I’m going to have my gas tank fueled and I’m going to have my boys on standby,” said Hill.

The 9th Congressional District is comprised of 46 municipalities that stretch from the South Shore to Cape Cod and over to New Bedford and part of Fall River.
 Incumbent U.S. Rep. William Keating, D-Bourne, is seeking re-election to a sixth term in the 9th District seat. He is being challenged by Michael Manley, of Brewster, and Helen Brady, of Plymouth.
 We asked the candidates a set of questions. Here are Keating's answers.
 Why are you running? What most motivates you?
 Historians call this one of the most important elections our country has ever experienced. I agree.
 The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact has brought the worst non-military crisis our country has faced in over a century. The Trump Administration has done a poorer job than dozens of other governments around the world. America, while only 4% of the world's population, represents over 20% of the virus deaths.
 While this Administration has denied, misled, and downplayed the dangerousness of this virus, I have worked tirelessly with my House colleagues to aid individuals, families, and businesses with vital healthcare, food security, and economic assistance.
 I have worked with the true heroes among us during this trying time. We have been blessed in our community with extraordinary frontline healthcare workers and first responders. I'm humbled to have the unsolicited endorsement of the Massachusetts Nurses Association and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers in this election.
 I'm running because I know first-hand the unique environmental, economic, business, and healthcare needs of our region. I'm running because I've been able to deliver resources and orchestrate action to meet our needs. And I'm running because I believe the legislative skill and knowledge I've acquired will be of great public service through this crisis and beyond.
 What is the most pressing issue in your district and how would you address it?
 We face the greatest healthcare crisis in over a century. It has laid bare to all of us the fragile nature of our healthcare system and how this can so drastically affect our personal and economic way of life.
 The pressing healthcare and economic effects of this have disproportionately hurt our region. On the economic side, our seasonal hospitality industry and its complementary small businesses have been ravaged. That's why our House initiative, the Paycheck Protection Program, was so important in creating a lifeline to employers and keeping employees in place. I led coalitions to push funding closer to smaller businesses and to change the qualifying time frame to make it flexible for seasonal industries. Our Heroes bill directly targets funding for restaurants and related industries.
 The healthcare effects have strained our major hospitals, community health centers, and our heroic doctors, nurses, and other frontline professionals. I have teamed up with all these groups to provide PPE, replacement funding for lost revenues, and testing resources. With a third wave of the virus already here, this will be a continuing necessity.
 And in the midst of this, the Trump Administration is in the Supreme Court seeking to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and destroy its essential healthcare rights like coverage for pre-existing conditions, under 26 years of age accessibility, prohibiting discrimination of rates for women as well as Medicare and regional opioid addiction coverage.
 We must fight to protect and restore these basic healthcare rights.
 How do you differ from the other candidates? What sets you apart?
 I am experienced, I know the issues, I live in Bourne, I know our region and am committed to fighting for the issues that matter most for our region.
 Since the pandemic, I have been having regular Zooms with community leaders and town halls with residents. I have the established relationships, in both Congress and our community, to address our most pressing needs. Rebuilding the Canal bridges, fighting to advance economic and security issues at Joint Base Cape Cod, working to bring the largest offshore wind farm in the country to our district with the staging area right in New Bedford, dredging our harbors, establishing a unified program to clean our water supply as well as address our estuaries and climate change, protecting our veterans and LGBTQ neighbors - I have been leading the way on these issues.
 What other information would you like voters to know about you or policy positions?
 The U.S. cannot continue the Trump Administration's "go it alone" direction. It limits our ability to expand our economy, undermines our greatest security advantage - our historic Western coalition -- and isolates us from facing the existential threats of climate change, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics. We must not move away from our basic civil rights. We must end systemic racism, protect women's health care decision rights, and stop discrimination based on one's sexual orientation.

The possibility of a historic turnout percentage has longer odds, but it's not out of the question. The Rowan County Board of Elections lists past turnout percentages on its website dating back to the late 1970s. The best among those records is 1984, when 75.28% of the 50,644 registered voters at the time cast a ballot. There are more people living in Salisbury and Rowan County now as well as more voters. So to top the 1984 number, 15,621 more voters need to cast a ballot. The biggest uncertainty is whether the historic turnout for early voting is an indicator of a shift in preference or a sign of heightened enthusiasm to vote. I think it's the latter.

“I wanted to make sure he was OK," Davis said. "We fighters, we go in there with a killer mindset at the end of the day we all have families to go home to and I definitely didn’t want anything crazy to happen to him.”


  The fighters exchanged a series of blows in the opening round while standing toe to toe. Davis hit the canvas late in the opening round after taking a right hook to the jaw, but Ramos quickly ruled it a slip after the fighters got tangled up.


  Santa Cruz suffered his own slip early in the second round, which led to Ramos cautioning Davis. The warning upset Davis and fueled Santa Cruz.


  Santa Cruz became the aggressor in the third round following his early success.


  Davis responded in the fourth round with a series of heavy blows to the head that seemed to stun Santa Cruz and slowed him early in the round. Santa Cruz would rally late with an overhand right straight to the nose that caused Davis to take a couple of steps back to gather himself.


  In the fifth round, Davis began to assert control with a series of body shots that slowed Santa Cruz.

However, this does not mean that courts do not have their value in states like Sierra Leone where, as presented and analyzed above, judicial independence is merely guaranteed on paper. They may in fact display independence in cases that may not threaten the core interest of the regime. The issues that the regime usually regards as its “core commitments” may be few and shifting over time. The ruling coalition certainly would not have an interest in every case that comes before courts. This makes courts still very important and useful to citizens and does serve the purpose of settling or adjudicating disputes between them, sometimes, if not most times, fairly. For instance, even with the criticism of the US Supreme Court by several political scientists like Robert Dahl as being a part of the dominant political coalition fostering its key policies, it cannot be gainsaid that its display of independence is far above that of courts in autocratic regimes at some historical point in countries like Turkey, Chile, Argentina, Nicaragua, Egypt, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, etc. This is what keeps them relevant within the system. Regrettably, however, judges anywhere, are not as independent as conventional teaching of the law has sought to present them to be, and judicial independence is a mirage that shifts depending on the core interests of the regime. This does not mean that courts do not act independently in some instances. Courts can act more impartially in countries where there is less concentration of power in the President or when institutional arrangements do not leave the executive with as much control as exists in Sierra Leone. Another check on the ability to influence the decisions and actions of courts would be the degree of plurality that exists within the political system. The more pluralistic the political system is, the wider the courts’ sphere of independence may be.

I recall a Woody Allen joke about a man who invents a time machine for just one absurd purpose.


  He dials his device to travel into the past to settle old scores with individuals who zinged him with putdowns, which he originally had no comebacks for.


  “Is that a bow tie, or is the circus in town? Where’s your red nose?”


  So the man uses a way-back machine just to correct his original retort, “So are you,” with a more pithy, “Look who’s talking. Are you still the opening act in the freak show?”


  I would never use advanced technology for such petty George Costanza revenge. Instead, I would push the lever back to Jan. 30 of this year.


  That’s when I covered the U.S. surgeon general, who was speaking at a conference at East Tennessee State University’s College of Medicine.


  I would tell Dr. Jerome M. Adams that the novel coronavirus is really serious stuff. It didn’t seem to be a looming public health threat when Adams, who spoke at a news conference in Johnson City following a roundtable discussion on the opioid crisis, told reporters that no evidence of human-to-human transmission had been identified at that point in the United States.


  Hours later, however, it was reported the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed the first case of the coronavirus being spread from person-to-person contact in Illinois.


  Dr. Lisa Piercey, the commissioner of Tennessee’s Department of Health, and U.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-1st, were also at that January conference. Piercey said the state was monitoring the situation, and suggested Tennesseans had much more to worry about from the flu.


  The surgeon general agreed, adding that steps taken to ward off the flu might also prove helpful in preventing the spread of the virus.


  “Clean your hands,” Adams said. “Stay home if you are sick, and cover your mouth when you cough.”


  Roe also said in late January that the CDC and other medical experts in the United States were studying the virus, and were confident vaccine trials could begin within 90 days.


  Roe said he was “comfortable” the virus can be contained.


  None of us could have imagined at that time just how quickly the virus would spread. Less than two months later, cases of COVID-19 were being reported in Sullivan and Washington counties.


  I wish I had a time machine so I go back and tell public officials to immediately implement mask mandates. It would have been the single most effective measure to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.


  It’s important today that Americans heed calls to wear masks in public. The virus is primarily spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Masks can help in reducing this spread.


  Too many folks in our area are not listening. They growl that no government is going to tell them what to do.


  “I have my rights!”


  You do, but your rights don’t give you permission to jeopardize the health and safety of others. If you are going to be so selfish, then you should just stay home.


  It is disturbing to responsible people to see so many folks refusing to mask up at the grocery stores and shopping centers. It’s also befuddling to see people wearing them incorrectly.


  When I see people wearing their face masks below their noses or on their chins, I know why there are so many unplanned pregnancies in this country.


  I also cringe when I hear that many Americans are dismissive when it comes to taking this simple precaution to slow the spread of the coronavirus. They lazily place all their defenses in the hands of a deity.


  “Should I put on my seat belt before I hit the road? No, I’ll leave my safety up to God’s will.”


  Interestingly, these are often the same people who oppose single-payer health care and insist that Americans “have some skin in the game” when it comes to their health care decisions.


  If only we could go back in time. How many lives could have been saved had we known in January what we know today about the value of masks?


  Since we can’t time travel, we’ll have to apply those painful COVID-19 lessons to dealing with the virus today. Mask up. It’s that simple.

The above works by the different scholars, though very insightful, may have exaggerated the degree of judicial independence that existed in the countries described above. For instance, the independence of the Egyptian courts was questionable because they were essentially latent agents of the regime directly fostering its economic and socio-political agendas. At best, the benefit that the Egyptian society received from the courts, including the enforcement of rights against the regime, could be considered as being merely reasonably incidental to creating a semblance of independence so as to attract investors (which was the primary objective of the regime). The courts were, by and large, allies of the regime; and that is what emboldened them to continue to expand their power unchallenged in most spheres of judicialization. The regime did not feel threatened in those spheres that mattered to them most, i.e., their credible commitments to attract investors and maintain the security of their power. In this regard, Egypt’s SCC were not much different than their Turkish or Mexican counterparts who similarly faithfully protected the core commitments of their regimes – to loyally maintain the regimes’ control over all sections of their respective societies. Those decision that seemingly demonstrated their independence may have been part of the subterfuges the courts use to maintain their legitimacy. By that, they use cases that do not touch the core interests of the regime and make decisions that resonate with citizens’ aspirations for triadic dispute resolution-type independence. It however serves the regime’s and the court’s interest more by increasing or maintaining the court’s power.

  With problems still lingering for local businesses and families, the eight candidates vying for Johnson City Commission recently shared their plans to help speed recovery.


  Vice Mayor Joe Wise, who was first elected to the commission in 2016, said the key is the city being a reliable partner, noting that Johnson City officials can and should provide essential services in a timely and cost- effective manner so people and businesses can thrive.


  “But good governance is not just about today, it’s about making decisions that prepare the city for tomorrow,” he said. “Reasonable and responsible leadership is what put Johnson City in the position to weather the COVID-19 pandemic without interruption to essential services or having to lay off employees.”


  Deborah Harley-McClaskey, a retired professor and administrator at East Tennessee State University, said she would collect data to monitor the unemployment level among city residents. She would also want the city to track the number of shuttered businesses, those that have cut expenses through employee layoffs, or left rental office space to operate from home.


  She also suggested that city leaders convene educators, faith organizations, nonprofit directors and providers of social services and health care to determine gaps in economic support and connect families to programs.


  “There are no handbooks or websites for families who are facing hunger and homelessness,” she said.


  Communication with federal and state representatives about additional resources is also important, Harley-McClaskey said, as well as promoting policies that support families and businesses during the economic recovery.


  Dr. Turney Williams, the medical director at Pain Medicine Associates, said Johnson City is already positioned better than most for a quick recovery because of its “relatively conservative” approach to finances.


  “We need to double down on the right ideas like keeping taxes low and holding the line on city spending and reject the radicalism that has failed so badly in big cities,” he said. “Defunding the police would devastate our economy, and while we should take public health precautions to protect the most vulnerable, more lockdowns would likely do more harm than good.”


  Aaron Murphy, executive director of Good Samaritan Ministries, said the remote worker population in Johnson City is growing.


  “Johnson City is becoming a refuge for those from other areas wanting a good community, thriving schools, safe neighborhoods, job opportunities and quality of life,” Murphy said. “This in turn will help our local economy recover by increasing the customer base for local businesses.”


  Murphy said the city should assist businesses in finding creative ways to reach customers virtually and to provide products online. City leaders should also ensure small businesses are aware of government grants.


  Also originally elected to the City Commission in 2016, Dr. Todd Fowler said the city is working to ensure government grant dollars are being put toward organizations providing food and rent money to families and individuals.


  Although cases and hospitalizations are increasing, Fowler said city leaders have seen people increasingly return to work. He expects a vaccine will speed up that process.


  On the city’s end, he said leaders have been trying to keep all city employees working and employed, but he expects the slowdown in commercial development, for example, will improve once the outlook on the virus improves.


  Alona Norwood, a board member on the New Generation Freedom Fighters, said she wants to help businesses use curbside service and takeout options as the weather gets colder. She also advocates providing aid to establishments that are applying for financial help from the federal and state government.


  Norwood also wants to see the city connect families with resources like food, financial assistance and child care, especially for working parents that have students receiving online instruction.


  ETSU student Kyle Beagle said the city needs to lift financial burdens on residents, pointing to utilities, taxes and licensing fees that business owners incur. He also suggested that Johnson City start a relief fund to support local establishments.


  “Ultimately, the focus is to create protections that encourage both our local economy and community,” he said.


  Jeff Clark, a local carpenter who ran for City Commission in 2016, said Johnson City can play an active role in keeping the economy stable, pointing to measures like tax forgiveness for small businesses and rent control.


  He said the city could also provide more pay for its employees, pledging to raise minimum wage for city workers to $15 an hour and bring teachers to the national wage average.


  “By doing this we can make sure we are keeping those that keep our good city running during these times can survive,” he said.

The decision will be made around year-end after the ministry receives an interim report in mid-November from two private firms familiar with the issue.


  The government in June rolled back plans to deploy the land-based anti- missile system, saying the proposed deployment in the prefectures of Akita and Yamaguchi would put residents at risk of falling rocket boosters.


  The ministry also said that modifying the technology would take years and cost too much.


  As a substitute measure, the ministry is now focusing on two possible options — remodeling private-sector vessels so the Aegis system can be mounted on them and building dedicated maritime ships with the system.


  The land-based system to address the increased threat of North Korean ballistic missiles was originally aimed at helping reduce the workload of MSDF personnel by shouldering part of missile defense program from ashore. The MSDF is facing a severe shortage of personnel.


  With China stepping up its maritime activities in the East China Sea, patrols once out at sea could last more than a month for MSDF members, adding to concerns.


  As Japan is seemingly adhering to a plan to introduce Lockheed Martin Corp.'s SPY-7 radar system, a larger ship will be required because the new radar's height requires a vessel width greater than that of the conventional Aegis destroyers. The SPY-7 radar can be loaded onto sea-based facilities as well as onshore ones, as in the original plan.


  The proposed displacement of 9,000 tons exceeds that of the Maya, the largest Aegis destroyer to date, which was commissioned in March with a displacement of 8,200 tons.


  But one ministry source expressed skepticism about the plan, calling it a "desperate measure" rushed by the sudden political decision to halt the original program.


  That echoes the opinions of some defense experts, who doubt the ship-based option will provide Japan with the same level of security since an offshore platform would be at risk in inclement weather.


  Others voiced concern about rising costs in line with a possible increase in the size of the ship.

Clarence Mangham Pippin, Jr., "Bubber," passed away peacefully on Friday afternoon at home on the land he farmed his entire life. He was 87. Bubber was a larger than life character. His unique and outgoing presence left deep impressions everywhere he went and on everyone he met.
 Born in Albany on November 16, 1932, to C.M. Pippin, Sr. and Alma Wright Pippin, he grew up farming on the same land on which he was born, he lived, and where he eventually passed away. He left after high school to study at the University of Georgia where he continued to be well known as much, if not more, for pranks and mischief as for academic activities. He returned with a degree in Animal Husbandry.
 Throughout his life he was well known for throwing the unique and interesting parties. Fun hayrides, fishing trips, tremendous bonfires, and dancing contests were all memorable events people still talk about many years later. And there were also games and events where contestants boxed, chased pigs, rode on shaking trees, wrestled cows, and climbed trees to catch chickens.
 However, these excursions and leisure moments are really just outliers in the life of Bubber Pippin. Business was his true love and passion. He was a farmer all his life, but to be a farmer that long means you find ways to make money when farming doesn't pay. Raising cattle, building apartment buildings, trading in military surplus goods, handling municipal environmental waste, and managing somewhat obscure recording artists (who some of you have probably at least heard of but who won't be mentioned here) are just a few of the endless business dealings that occupied Bubber's ever active entrepreneurial mind. Despite all of that, most people know him for his pecans. As a president and founding member of Georgia Pecan Growers Association, he was a pioneer and leader in developing the commercial pecan industry in southwest Georgia. The farm on which he was born, and that he inherited from his father, is now run by his elder son and namesake, C.M. Pippin, III, or "Trey."

Over time, too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems, such as heart disease, nerve damage, eye problems and kidney disease.


  You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age. However, type 2 diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. You’re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are 45 or older, have a family history of diabetes, or are overweight or obese.


  In the U.S., Black adults are nearly twice as likely as white adults to develop type 2 diabetes. This racial disparity has been rising over the last 30 years.


  To investigate potential causes for this health disparity, a team led by Dr. Mercedes R. Carnethon at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine analyzed data collected from more than 4,200 participants in the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study. The research was supported in part by NIH’s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Results were published in the Journal of American Medical Association on Dec. 26, 2017.


  Study participants were recruited at ages 18 to 30 years from Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago; Minneapolis; and Oakland, California. About 49% of participants were Black; 54% were women. The researchers collected information from participants about different risk factors for diabetes over 30 years.


  They gathered personal and family medical history, as well as information about participants’ weight and health habits like smoking, drinking, and diet. They also tracked information about participants’ neighborhoods, education level, ability to pay bills, and employment status throughout young adulthood.


  The study found that the chance of developed diabetes was significantly higher for Black adults than for white adults (about 66 more cases of diabetes per 1,000 people). The greatest difference was between Black women and white women.


  The researchers used statistical analyses to determine how biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors contributed to rates of diabetes.


  They found that biological risk factors accounted for most of the health disparity. These factors included a combination of body mass index, waist measurement, fasting glucose levels, lipids, blood pressure and lung function.


  Differences between Blacks and whites in neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic and behavioral factors were also linked with diabetes, although to a lesser degree.


  “Obesity is driving these differences,” Carnethon says. “The findings surprised us, because for the past 20 years there was a narrative that there must be something we haven’t found that was causing this higher rate.... We now know there is no mystery to these higher rates. Our efforts to control the traditional risk factors can work to reduce the disparities we observe in diabetes incidence.”

Sharon Joyce (Haile) Dickson was united with her Savior and her eternal friends and family on Sunday September 20, 2020. Sharon was born February 11, 1933 to Ola (Reed) and Hugh Haile in Chickasha, Oklahoma and was raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She was a graduate of Classen High School and attended college at Oklahoma City University.


   


  In her young adult years, Sharon worked as a "soda jerk" and "short order" cook in several different restaurants. Later, she went to work full time at the Oklahoma State Capitol Building as a secretary. It was there that she met her future husband, Jack. The couple was married on January 23, 1953 in Oklahoma City and were married 61 years. That long and exceptional union produced four children; Jack (Rochelle) Dickson of Augusta, Kansas, Steven Dickson (Deceased), Terry Dickson of Topeka, Kansas, Cherryl (Gregg) Cox of Olathe, Kansas. In addition, the couple had eight grandchildren; Erin (Adam) Cobb, Amanda (Craig) Bormann, Callie (Elian Mota) MacDonald, Jordyn (Kendall Ladd) Cox, Shannon Dickson, Broderick Rocheford, Kenton Rocheford, and Steven Cox. Sharon is also survived by 5 great grand-children; India, Zooey, Solomon, Elia, and James.


   


  During her married years, Sharon was an exceptional wife and mother, taking interest in building her husband's chiropractic practice and supporting her children in their many activities. She was one of the first women to be P.T.A. president when her children were in elementary school and could be seen actively cheering at their sporting events and other activities such as theater, speech and debate, and scouting activities. Sharon was a den mother and youth group sponsor for many years. Wherever her children were involved, you could be sure Mom was close at hand supporting them in any way possible. Her kids were not just "her kids." She had a way of making every kid involved feel special and loved.


   


  Sharon was also a leader in her own right. She started a meal ministry at church and could be found planning menus, preparing meals, and assisting in clean-up on Wednesday nights. Mom's ministry motto was, "If you feed them, they will come!" Her famous meals won over more than one starving soul. In her later years, after her husband died, Sharon moved into Heritage House Apartments. When she learned that some of her neighbors there did not have enough food at the end of the month, she organized a food bank so that those who had could share with those who did not have enough.


   


  Her leadership extended to involvement with the El Dorado Elks Lodge. When women became eligible for membership, Sharon was one of the first to sign up. She went on to become Exalted Ruler of the lodge and later a District Deputy. In a time when women were just beginning to accept positions of leadership, Sharon was one of the first to step forward!


   


  Sharon is survived by sons, Jack and Terry and daughter Cherryl, niece Harmona in addition to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren as well as many who will always call her "mom." She was preceded in death by her parents, Hugh and Ola, her sister Fern, her husband Jack and one son, Steve. Those of us left behind can take comfort in the certainty that we will once again sit at a banquet table with her in the presence of the Lord.


   


  Memorials have been established with First United Methodist Church of El Dorado, El Dorado Elks Lodge #1407, El Dorado Rehabilitation Center and Shepherd's Grace Church of Arkansas City. Contributions in Sharon's name can be sent to Carlson's Funeral Home, 200 S. Star, El Dorado, KS 67042.


   


  In light of the increase in Covid 19 cases in Butler County and out of an abundance of caution and in concern for the care of all in the same spirit of care that Sharon always exhibited, the family has postponed the memorial service originally scheduled for November 2, 2020. Services will be rescheduled when the safety of all concerned can be more completely assured.

Hassan Sweidat is terrified he will catch Covid-19 in the overcrowded displacement camp in northwest Syria he calls home, even more so as medical staff in the region have become sick.
 Humanitarian workers fear any further rise in novel coronavirus cases would be disastrous in northwest Syria, where almost 1.5 million people live in overcrowded camps or shelters, often with poor access to running water.
 In an informal settlement in Idlib, the country's last major rebel stronghold, Sweidat said he and other displaced Syrians did not stand much chance against the disease.
 "We live in a camp all crammed in together. If someone talks to his family, all the neighbours can hear it," said Sweidat, who is in his forties and has an existing health condition.
 If someone gets sick, "it's hardly the disease's fault," the father of six added.
 In the encampment in Qah, a few makeshift solar panels shimmer on the canvas roofs of endless tiny breeze-block rooms where families have settled after being uprooted by war.
 Resting after helping a friend build a small room to serve as a shop, Sweidat said he hopes he does not have to take anyone in his family to the local hospital.
 "Hospitals are overcrowded. People have started to be scared of doctors and nurses, who they think might be infected, with all the sick people going to them."
 \- 'End our misery' -
 Sweidat, who fled his home seven years ago, especially fears catching the Covid-19 disease as he suffers from a chronic liver condition.
 "One of my relatives got it a while back, and I'm really scared because I have no immunity," he said.
 The Idlib bastion -- now dominated by a group led by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate -- has been battered by years of war.
 Local and international humanitarian workers are working to contain the virus, but cases are still on the rise.
 "In the northwest, confirmed cases have increased six-fold over the last month, with cases also rising in displacement camps and settlements," Mark Lowcock, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, told the UN Security Council on Tuesday.
 The health authorities in northwest Syria have officially announced 5,075 cases of Covid-19 so far, including 42 deaths.
 Of those, more than 860 cases have been recorded among healthcare staff and almost 330 people in the camps, figures showed Wednesday.
 Seated cross-legged on the floor, as she crushed small green olives one by one with a brick, 80-year-old Ghatwa al-Mohommad said she and her family felt like sitting ducks.
 "We're scared of the disease but we don't dare leave," she added.
 "We're so confused about what we should do. If only God would have us die and end our misery."
 Of the three million people living in Idlib, around half live in makeshift homes and tents after escaping the fighting during Syria's nine-year civil war.
 The latest Russia-backed regime offensive on the region last winter killed around 500 civilians and forced nearly one million people to flee their towns and villages.
 Since a ceasefire brokered by Moscow and rebel-backer Ankara came into force in March, only around 200,000 people have returned home.
 \- Distancing 'near impossible' -
 At the Idlib health directorate, doctor Yahya Naameh said they had asked residents to observe social distancing.
 But he admitted that was "near impossible" in the hundreds of informal settlements dotting the region.
 Few in the camps wear masks. Many cannot afford to buy face coverings, or to change them regularly, let alone disinfectant hand gels.
 For most, food, water, medicine and school supplies are far more important.
 "The regime and Russian forces are responsible for displacing these people and for the disastrous conditions in which they now live," Naameh said.
 Back in the camp, Mohammad al-Omar, 40, agreed that asking people to self- isolate in a tent city was not realistic.
 "They tell us, 'Don't go out. Don't cause overcrowding'. But we live in tents barely half a metre (yard) apart," said the father of four, who was displaced by the conflict eight years ago.
 "They give all of us who are older than five one mask as if that were enough. But it's not."
 Omar, who works as the driver of a water truck, said he cannot stay inside the camp as he needs to earn money.
 "If I stay put in my tent, how will I live? How will I eat?"

Hundreds — if not 1,000 or more — East Texas Republicans gathered Saturday in a pasture off FM 58 following the latest Trump flag parade around Lufkin.


  The event was the third rally held on David and Kourtney Frankens’ property in the last seven days. This movement began Monday afternoon and has grown significantly from a few dozen, to a few hundred and more attendees, David Frankens said.


  “Today, I don’t know what the account is, but it’s pretty massive,” he said.


  “I think it shows a lot of support, a lot of sincerity. I see more sincerity than support because I think people are concerned at large, confused perhaps there’s sort of a fear of the unknown.”


  He enjoyed seeing how happy his visitors were.


  The rally was highlighted by the Trump flag fairy/ninja/hero, who departed shortly after posting an American flag to a tree top and speeches by U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, state Rep. Trent Ashby and state Board of Education member Dr. Keven Ellis, who encouraged attendees to vote.


  “Get out and vote, bring everybody that hasn’t voted that you have found out to vote and monitor the polling places, we need poll watchers who are properly trained,” Gohmert said before going on stage.


  “We’re not in as much danger of fraud in East Texas as we are in big cities. Of course that’s why I love being here in East Texas ... good people.”


  On stage, Gohmert discussed how much he loves East Texas and told the crowd that the persecution of Christianity is growing.


  Jason Harrison, who said he was a proud 76-year-old man from Nacogdoches, ran up to Gohmert in a red buttoned-down shirt, sequined blue tie and Make America Great Again hat to thank him for his service as a representative. He follows both Gohmert and Trump avidly and was thrilled with Gohmert’s behavior while Congress was in session, he said.


  “I love Trump, I love Louie. That man there,” Harrison said gesturing to Gohmert, “has done more, or at least as much as, anybody ever has. It’s people like him and Trump that will make this country come back around.”


  Haley Havard said she is an avid Trump supporter and was there to support him, despite the hate he receives.


  “We’re here to support him. To show him we love him. We vote for him. We want our country to stay the way it is. We don’t want to be socialists,” she said. “He is for America. He is for America first. He is putting the working class people up front and foremost where I feel like Biden is not.”


  She believes Biden is getting rid of the oil industry and is not OK with that. Her husband is a pipeliner for a gas company and losing that work would affect her family, her children.


  “Trump is working for us,” she said.


  Ashby said nobody could look at the crowd gathered on the Frankens property and not be inspired by their movement.


  “We are just hours away from one of, if not the most, critical elections of our lifetime,” Ashby said. “All we need to do to make and keep America great and to make and keep Texas great and to make and keep Angelina County great is to vote our morals and our values.”


  Ashby pointed to the good work he believes Gohmert does, and said that state representatives needed similar support as they fight to maintain control of the Texas Legislature in Austin.


  “The majority party of the Texas House for the last 20 years has been the Republican party,” Ashby said. “But folks, the Democrats are nine seats away from flipping authority and taking it. This election is so critical to keeping a Republican House, Senate and, of course, all of our statewide elected officials.”


  Ellis took a poll of who was voting Democrat versus Republican and was met by cheers from the hundreds of Republicans and silence with no vocal Democrats in the crowd. He told attendees they would not want Democrats in control of the State Board of Education.


  He encouraged voters to vote Republican from the White House to the school house.


  “There’s no way to really over emphasize the importance of this election,” Lufkin attorney Bob Flournoy told the crowd after Ellis exited the stage.


  “It’s our responsibility to tell people. There are so many people who don’t go vote at all or they don’t know who to vote for. Well, if they know you, they better know who to vote for and you better see that they go on Tuesday to vote.


  “Our country is at stake. It’s do or die time folks.”

Myrtle Beach, SC--Located in Surfside Beach, part of South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach resort area, the 950-seat Celebration Music Theatre opened earlier this year as a home to world-class live entertainment. The Theatre features the artist tribute show SUPERSTARZ! Live! with entertainers performing hits from Elvis, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Cher, Barbra Streisand and many other stars.
 The Celebration Music Theatre occupies the site of a former live-performance venue, where the stage, video, lighting, wiring and other parts of the theatre have now been totally redone. All previous audio and video equipment has been removed to make room for a completely new installation that includes more than 30 Harman’s JBL Vertec line arrays powered by Crown amplifiers.
 Local installation specialist Commercial Audio, Inc. was contracted for the renovation, led by sales and marketing director Adam Hyman and owner Chad Johnson. The company installed 16 JBL Vertec VT4886 subcompact line array elements and VT4883 subcompact arrayable subwoofers, along with two ASB6128 subwoofers, six AC28/95 and six AC16 ultra-compact loudspeakers. Crown I-Tech HD IT9000HD, XTi 4000 and CTs 1200 power amps drive the loudspeakers. A Soundcraft Vi1 64/24-input digital console handles both front of house and monitor mixing.
 "I went with JBL and Crown because of my previous experience with both brands, their reliability and their broad product lineup that covers practically any professional installation situation," said Johnson. "The theater is more than twice as wide than it is deep, so I selected the Vertec VT4886’s for their coverage pattern, which I was confident would work in such an unconventional room shape. I deployed the VT4886 speakers in arrays across the top left, center and right of the stage, which provided even coverage throughout the width of the room without any gaps in the distribution of sound to the audience."
 Johnson also placed the VT4883 subwoofers beneath each of the two center arrays, and an ASB6128 sub under each left and right stack. In addition, three AC16 speakers are placed on either side of the stage as front fills for the front rows of the theatre. The six JBL AC28/95 speakers are used as on-stage monitors, located at various points along the stage.
 "I had used the Vertec VT8886 line arrays in previous projects, but not in a room that was wider than it was deep," Johnson said. "They work extremely well in the Celebration Music Theatre and we’re very happy with the results."

They are the names of black men and women who have died at the hands of police, painted just above another wall where DeLarge has sprayed enormous graffiti letters that spell out, “Black Lives Matter.”


  “People have been giving me a list of names, people have been reaching me for names to add, people close to them and stuff like that," DeLarge said. "It’s kind of sad. There’s more coming. We have a stack of names.”


  On Tuesday, DeLarge added the name Marlon Lewis.


  Lewis’s family drove from Badin, about 45 miles away, to watch as the letters were spray-painted on. A niece and nephew climbed a ladder to add the finishing puffs of white paint.


  Lewis died in December 2016 when Stanley County Sheriff’s deputies Tasered him 26 times in less than five minutes after responding to his 911 call for distress. According to reports, police said the 39-year-old told them “someone is going to kill me,” fought officers and repeatedly grabbed for their holstered guns that night. No criminal charges were filed, but the family settled a lawsuit.


  Lewis’s oldest sister, Marcia Watkins, contacted DeLarge immediately after she saw the artist’s new mural on Instagram. She asked for her brother’s name to be added.


  “We tried to keep a memorial up in our community, but the police kept taking it down," Watkins said. "So when I saw this, I called him and asked if he’d consider adding my brother’s name to his mural. And he said right away, yes he would.”


  It turned into a family reunion of sorts as three of Lewis’s sisters and his brother gathered next to the building housing NoDa Market & Deli and Abari where the murals are painted. Every few minutes, strangers walked past to pose for photos next to “Black Lives Matter,” oblivious to the ceremony taking place on the wall above them.


  For DeLarge, it’s an opportunity to play a small part in the Black Lives Matter movement, drawing attention to stories and names that might otherwise be overlooked.


  “A lot of people get to pretend like this doesn’t happen," he said. "A lot of people don’t even hear about when this happens. Like this family; a lot of people reached out to me and asked me, ‘Oh, I never heard of this. Who are these people? What happened?’


  “I’m afforded a great lifestyle because I paint pictures on walls. Throughout all of this, obviously I’m brown and I’ve dealt with racism throughout my lifetime. I have nieces and nephews who are Mexican, Blaxican, a swirl of ethnicities, and I know they’re going to deal with it growing up. I just felt like it was the least I could do.”


  Watkins says she’s going to bring her brother’s 13-year-old son to the mural soon. Josh Lewis will be able to see his father’s name up there, nestled among a growing list that serves as a sad reminder.

Neither First Born Holy Church, where First Born CDC operates, nor Greater New Birth has reopened its sanctuary since March. Driver preaches to her congregation in the parking lot. Spencer said Hurricane Isaias caused a roof leak and damaged the floor at First Born church.


  It is not the first storm First Born has weathered. A former recipient of funding from the United Way of Pitt County, First Born has reported financial strain in recent years, a situation that Spencer said was worsened by the pandemic.


  “The pandemic has really made it so you can’t go soliciting (for donations),” she said. “You can’t go out. It’s just it’s hard to try to keep funds in there, just to keep the lights on.”


  Driver said she is not sure how much it will cost to continue the feeding ministry but she anticipates that volunteers from Greater New Birth and partner churches, St. Monica and Beech Grove, may have to launch fundraising efforts to keep it going.


  “Right now we’re doing it out of pocket. We’re really don’t know how much it will cost to keep it going,” she said. “It works; we’ve been able to do it. I don’t know how. It’s just God multiplying what we do have.”


  First Born distributes an average of 8,000 to 10,000 pounds of food a month through the federal Emergency Food Assistance Program. Driver and Spencer are working together to help Greater Works Foundation of HOPE get established as a member agency with the Food Bank of Central and Eastern Carolina.


  Driver said the church has freezers and is converting part of its current dining room to make room for more food storage space. She said she and her congregation of about 30 members are happy to make the sacrifice to help others in need.


  “My heart is into what I’m doing,” she said. “I love to see the people come. They’re so thankful. I’ve seen tears. … It just touches your heart.”


  Driver said Spencer will remain involved in the effort, even though it will no longer be based at First Born.


  “I know it breaks her heart that it has come to this point but then it gives her joy that she’ll still be a part of it,” Driver said. “She’ll sill be helping Grimesland and the surrounding areas.


  “We’re definitely going to take the load off her shoulders and still serve the people with the same spirit.”


  Spencer’s father, Bishop J. L. Smith, established First Born to provide food and clothing to people in need. Six of Smith’s 16 children remain involved with the ministry today.


  “My dad taught us respect for other people and love, ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,’” Spencer said, quoting a New Testament verse commonly referred to as The Golden Rule. “You need to help somebody else. My dad and mom, they always commanded us to love one another and love others.


  “We are our brother’s keeper,” she said. “We’re going to try to continue to serve the community. We don’t intend to stop serving. It’s just not going to be at First Born.”

High Resolution Systems is now offering comprehensive training for video professionals who want to master the Vista Spyder video processor, DVI routers and switchers, and device control.
 The package combines hands-on training in three related areas to ensure proficiency with some of today’s most in-demand AV technology and systems.
 “It’s a powerful educational opportunity that incorporates the knowledge and experience that High Resolution Systems has in all three areas,” said founding partner, Mike Taylor. “Almost every week we’re asked to train Spyder X20 users. We also offer digital video training sessions as the U.S. distributor of Lightware Visual Engineering’s DVI routers and switchers through our Lightware U.S.A. division. And we market our own UDC (Universal Device Controller) control solution. Since those three areas work together it made sense to develop a training package that gives video professionals a deeper understanding of how to integrate the technology as a system to meet their AV needs.”
 Drew Taylor, a partner in High Resolution Systems, believes that video professionals benefit from the comprehensive and integrated approach. “Although we already offer specific Spyder and Lightware training, putting it together with our UDC control solution under one umbrella is a much better approach for customers,” he said. “It gives them a well-rounded education on these key devices and video systems, including a history of video processing, switching and control technology.”
 High Resolution Systems customizes one- to three-day classes onsite at the customer’s facility bringing the Spyder, Lightware DVI routers and switchers and the UDC for up-close-and-personal sessions with the gear. “We have a PowerPoint presentation that gives a foundation for the training, then we tailor sessions to bring any level of user up to speed on the technology,” said Mike Taylor.
 BlueWater Technologies, a national AV company and integrator based in Southfield, Michigan, was the first to take advantage of High Resolution Systems’ training package.
 “We needed to upgrade the skills of our staff on these systems and saw an opportunity to do that efficiently with High Resolution’s overall training approach,” said senior project engineer Mike Golding. “Having them onsite with the equipment and integrating sessions in all three areas gave our employees a unique understanding of how the technology works.”

A drive through the South Shore paints a picture of a relatively split electorate.


  There's a store that sells nothing but pro-President Donald Trump shirts, hats and stickers in Hanson, but in Norwell there are residential streets with Joe Biden signs in every front yard.


  Mayors in Quincy and Weymouth lean to the right, but every Massachusetts representative in Congress is a Democrat.


  In the State House, South Shore senators and representatives are relatively evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.


  Locally, the region's voters elect officials who run the gamut.


  But when it comes to casting a vote for president, the South Shore and the state have voted Democratic for nearly two decades. And officials say that's unlikely to change.


  "I don't expect the tide to turn. I think Biden will do well throughout Massachusetts, including the South Shore, but he will likely do less well in the South Shore than in other areas," Paul Watanabe, professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, said. "This area has shown over the last decade or so that there are some pockets of Republican support in large towns and small. ... But I don't expect a giant change. I don't expect this area of the state to become a solidly Republican area, by any means."

  In 2016, South Shore voters lined up to support Hillary Clinton in even greater numbers than they did for Barack Obama, who defeated Mitt Romney in his home state of Massachusetts in 2012. Trump won a fraction of South Shore towns in the 2016 election. Carver, Hanover, Pembroke, Hanson, Kingston, Whitman and Halifax all voted for the current president.


  Watanabe said the South Shore has held on to conservatism despite a greater shift toward liberalism in other parts of the state, largely due to a general lack of racial diversity.


  "The Greater Boston area has largely diversified over the last decade. Some of the South Shore has as well, but much of the South Shore has been slower to diversify and remains majority white," he said. "While we see some parts of the South Shore, like Quincy and Randolph, which have seen tremendous transformation racially, we see less of this diversification in other communities and Republican support largely comes from those majority white populations."


  In some communities, Clinton's margin of victory was huge in 2016. She won by more than 30 percent in Milton and Randolph, and more than 20 percent in Quincy, Hingham and Cohasset. In other towns, she just scraped by. Clinton won Rockland by just 57 votes, Abington by 86 and Marshfield by 98.


  In Marshfield - where Clinton received 7,288 votes to Trump's 7,190 - Republican Town Committee Chairman Dennis McMath said he thinks a Republican victory could very well happen. He said voters in Marshfield and beyond are concerned about a lack of support for law enforcement on the Democratic ticket, and said many unenrolled voters are concerned about Biden's alignment with a "radical socialist" platform.


  "I fully expect Trump to do better this election," he said this week. "We have been doing two Trump/Back the Blue standouts at the Scituate Harbor rotary each week. The response has been overwhelming in support."


  Rachael Cobb, an associate professor of government at Suffolk University, said single-issue voters, like those who will vote solely based on law enforcement support, are rare. Most people have several plates spinning at once and are invested in multiple issues, she said, but added that there are plenty of single-issue groups that try to dominate the conversation and pull voters to one side or the other.


  "A single issue could be the motivator for a voter, but then you ask if there is a counter-movement that will draw people out," she said. "The question becomes 'Is that the issue that is putting everyone over the edge? Or is it the pandemic? Or is it the protests from this summer?' There are a lot of competing issues. ... There are just so many drivers this year. In a non- pandemic year, I could see (Back the Blue) maybe being the kicker for people, but there are so many things that could be the kicker this year."


  Watanabe said voters may choose the Republican ticket not only because Trump's platform is aligned with support for law enforcement, but because he's positioned himself in line with other issues important to conservative voters, such as gun ownership and abortion.


  "Many of these voters are drawn not by Trump's personality or character, but because of issues he's aligned himself with. Policies like that draw some voters to the Republican Party almost despite the fact that Trump is the candidate," he said. "Some voters will hold their noses and vote for Trump because he represents some of the values they have, not because they like him as an individual."


  In Pembroke, where Trump was victorious by 289 votes in 2016, Democratic Town Committee Chairwoman Jessica Rushing said liberal residents have stepped up to try to stop a second Trump victory.


  "Our DTC has had a ton of Pembroke residents asking how they can get involved and how they can make a difference," she said. "We've probably doubled the number of people at our meetings. I've seen an uptick in people who may have not made the effort before working to make sure it doesn't happen again."


  Rushing, who is also a selectman, said she hopes Trump's presidency is more likely to draw hordes of Democratic voters than Republican ones, but she's hesitant to make that assumption.


  "It does scare me," she said. "I'm hoping it's driving Democratic turnout. I'm hoping people who may have been complacent four years ago realize that this is not a time for sitting back and letting whatever happens happen. ... This is the most important election in a generation. I'm really hoping for an overwhelming blue wave that shows the policies that have been enacted under this administration are not the values we stand for as a country."


  Secretary of State William Galvin said earlier this month that he predicts a record-setting number of ballots will be cast, even exceeding the 75 percent voter turnout in the 2016 election.

  "I'm hopeful. It seems the level of interest is there," Galvin said. "We had 3.3 million votes in 2016. It seems we will exceed that."


  It's those voters -- newly registered residents or those who didn't turn out in 2016 -- who could shift the tide. In towns where just a few hundred votes or less made the difference, it's anyone's race, Cobb said.


  "There is huge interest, engagement and participation this year. It appears to be cutting across all demographic groups. Young people are engaged in numbers that are dramatically increased compared to previous elections," she said.


  Cobb said there are multiple reasons the 2016 election may not be the best indicator of how people or communities will vote this time around. Just because the South Shore went blue in the last presidential race doesn't mean it will again.


  "We saw depressed turnout in 2016. Some of it because people didn't like any of the candidates, so they decided to stay home, and some people found themselves the victim of confusing changes to voter laws, so they didn't even try," Cobb said. "2016 was, given the protests that happened after Trump was elected, less of an indicator and more of a wake-up call. I think it has had a mobilizing effect."

The God of War franchise dominated PlayStation 2 and 3 during both of those respective consoles' runs, and it was the same for its debut PlayStation 4 entry. This new take on the franchise was a surprise to fans at first because of how much had been changed from the series' original formula (and to Kratos as a character, himself), but now it's one of the most popular entries in the franchise overall.


  While there's still no real way to truly guess what's coming next for the _God of War_ series, it was confirmed that a new game in the series is now in the works for a release on PlayStation 5. Fans have tried their best to theorize about this sequel entry, but it's still far too early to really tell!


  What did you think of the newest entry in the _God of War_ series? How did it compare to the past entries of the franchise seen on the PlayStation 2 and 3?

The political establishment in Washington, D.C. has never really understood what North Carolina is all about — our voters care about prosperity, not ideology.


  For decades, in election cycle after election cycle, the political elites pledged to uplift North Carolina communities and implement policies that would transform our state into an economic powerhouse. But as soon as our ballots were cast, these political opportunists instantly forgot all about their promises.


  Luckily for the Tar Heel state, this trend of neglect ended in 2016, when we helped elect an outsider who rejected the traditional mold of U.S. politics.


  Despite running as a Republican, Donald Trump abandoned many of the GOP’s outdated positions on issues ranging from trade to tax reform, vowing to pass legislation that would protect American jobs and empower American workers. In an even bigger break from political norms, that is exactly what he has done since taking office.


  Thanks to the groundbreaking Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, North Carolinians are saving an average of $1,328 on their federal income taxes annually — or nearly $4,000 over three years. But this was more than mere fiddling with tax rates, which was the extent of previous tax cut bills. Significantly, the TCJA doubled both the child tax credit and the standard deduction, ensuring that working families were among the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump tax cuts.


  This sweeping tax reform legislation also funded a brand new economic initiative to direct massive amounts of private investment into hundreds of low-income North Carolina communities. In fact, under the revolutionary Opportunity Zones (OZ) program, there are a total of 252 designated communities receiving federal tax benefits that are carefully tailored to promote economic growth and wealth creation.


   


  While it’s difficult to calculate the immediate impact of Opportunity Zones on local communities, the Council of Economic Advisers recently found that nationally, the program had already “raised $75 billion in private capital by the end of 2019, most of which would not have entered OZs without the incentive.”


  “This new capital represents 21 percent of total annual investment in OZs and helps explain why the CEA also finds that private equity investment in OZ businesses grew 29 percent relative to the comparison group of businesses in eligible communities that were not selected as OZs,” the report added.


  Over the past few months, North Carolina has become a focal point of this pivotal election, as both presidential campaigns zero in on hotly-contested battleground states that could help them win on Nov. 3.


  Democrat nominee Joe Biden, a career politician who has spent nearly half a century in Washington, has relentlessly attacked Donald Trump as a typical country club Republican, complaining that he only cares about Wall Street and falsely claiming that “Trump’s tax cuts” — which Biden has vowed to repeal — only benefit the wealthy. But these cheap political attacks and distortions will not matter to North Carolinians this November for the same reason they didn’t matter in 2016 — our voters care about substance, not style.


  This election is not about tribalism and partisan politics. At the end of the day, North Carolinians just want a leader who will safeguard our prosperity and keep his promises. This election is once again a choice between a straight-shooting outsider and a pandering establishment elitist.
