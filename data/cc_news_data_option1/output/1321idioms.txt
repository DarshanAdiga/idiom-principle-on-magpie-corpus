Eagles CB Darius Slay wants 'the game on me'

He's got no medical experience, was never elected or saw military service, but as Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner has crucial access -- and now he's White House pointman for the coronavirus crisis.
 A youthful looking 39, Kushner is no stranger in Washington. Although he'd never served at any level of government before, his marriage to Trump's daughter Ivanka put him at the heart of power after the 2016 election.
 Now Kushner's surprise appearance at Trump's daily coronavirus briefing Thursday has confirmed his rise to the top tier on one of the greatest crises to hit the country in its history.
 Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, is meant to be coordinating the complex government response to an illness overwhelming the health system and economy.
 For days there had been whispers that Kushner, a real estate scion who casts himself as a dynamic thinker, was running a shadow team. On the briefing room podium, Kushner emerged from that shadow.
 While making sure to say he was there to assist Pence, Kushner spoke with the self-confidence -- critics often call it arrogance -- of someone enjoying unique influence.
 Asked to describe his still vaguely defined mission, Kushner suggested he would reinvigorate a team struggling with the dire challenge of battling the pandemic across the vast, diverse country.
 Kushner said Trump had asked him "to make sure that we think outside the box, make sure we're finding all the best thinkers in the country, making sure we're getting all the best ideas."
 \- Drama in the house -
 The Trump White House is regularly marked by personnel dramas that wouldn't look out of place on the president's old reality TV show "The Apprentice."
 Senior figures come and go at a fast pace, sometimes fired by tweet, and in several cases departing on the bitterest of terms.
 A month ago, Trump fired his third chief of staff. The replacement, Mark Meadows, took weeks to assume his office, meaning the president was without a key aide just as the coronavirus was ballooning into disaster.
 The slick, apparently highly focused Kushner saw his moment.
 This isn't the first time Kushner takes up a role that many might shy from.
 Earlier this year, he brought out Trump's plan for nothing less than resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Again, he went into that diplomatic minefield with no relevant experience.
 The plan was panned by almost everyone except for the Israeli government and its Washington backers. But the episode demonstrated Kushner's extraordinary position.
 Now, with state governors and Trump wrangling over who has responsibility for securing and delivering medical supplies to coronavirus-hit areas of the country, Kushner is back, promising to get results where others failed.
 He said he would "break down every barrier needed to make sure the teams can succeed."
 \- 'Scared' -
 The White House feels it is being unfairly blamed for delays in the supply chain from equipment stockpiles and manufacturers to hospitals and ordinary citizens.
 In the world's richest country, lifesaving ventilators are in desperately tight supply. It is difficult for most people even to get a simple face mask.
 Trump argues the shortfall of medical supplies is the fault of state governors, not the federal government, which he describes as a mere back-up, rather than leader.
 In his briefing appearance, Kushner was right on message, saying that individual states have no automatic right to such assistance.
 "The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile," Kushner said, drawing instant scorn from his opponents on Twitter. "It's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use."
 In scathing comments, Kushner went on to say that the crisis was revealing which politicians were "better managers." He described some governors as "scared" and confused.
 Supporters of Kushner say he is unusually bright, even a "hidden genius," as Trump's former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, said in 2018.
 On the frontline of the pandemic, the controversial son-in-law will have his chance to prove that right and his detractors wrong.

Pollux and Castor are two fairly bright stars not far apart on the face of the night sky, prominent on April evenings. These two are considered the "heads" in the constellation, Gemini the Twins.      They're not exactly identical twins.      Despite the bright moonlight this week, they stand out, high in the southern sky between 8 and 9 p.m. (daylight savings time) They are visible most of the night, setting in the northwest a little after 3 a.m.      Orion, the majestic constellation with its famed trio of stars marking Orion's Belt, can be used to point right at Pollux and Castor. Orion is a bit lower, in the south-southwest around 8-9 p.m. Trace an imagined line from Orion's bright blue-white star Rigel at lower right of the "Belt," through the bright red star Betelgeuse at upper left of the "Belt." Continue this line to the upper left, to the Castor and Pollux duo.      (Betelgeuse, by the way, has triumphantly regained its brightness after a few months of unusual dimness this winter.)      Pollux is the brightest of the two "heads" of the Twins, and the lower one (assuming you aren't in the Southern Hemisphere where the perspective is turned on its head). The star's color is light yellow-orange. In 2006, a planet about 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, was discovered circling the star. The International Astronomical Union has named this planet Thestias.      Castor is bluish-white and bright, but less so than Pollux. Castor's claim to fame for amateur astronomers training their backyard telescopes at the sky is that there are actually six stars in the Castor system. We see it as one, with unaided eyes. There are three pairs of binary (double) stars, orbiting around a common center of mass.      Telescopes, however, only pick up three of these stars. Two are easily seen in a small telescope; you may also find a third star, which is a lot fainter. Each of them are double stars themselves, but they are so close it takes a spectroscope, splitting the starlight into their spectrum of colors, to resolve them as double stars. They don't know anything about social distancing, a serious matter here on planet Earth lately.      The rest of the naked-eye stars making up the pattern of Gemini the Twins stretch back to the west (or right as seen on an April evening), towards Orion. There is a beautiful star cluster known as M35 located near the stars marking one of the "feet" of the Twins. M35 is easily visible in binoculars when the moon isn't around, and is a fine sight in a small telescope.      It's interesting to note that Pollux is 34 light-years from the Earth, and Castor is 51 light-years away. That means the two "heads" of Gemini the Twins are 17 light-years apart. It takes that many years for the starlight from one to reach the other. That would seem to make the Twins an incredibly immense couple of brothers.      Of course, we know that the constellations are imagined, two-dimensional patterns of our making. The stars across the sky are in three dimensions, at greatly varying distances. A space traveler heading out among the stars would observe that the constellation patterns as we know them become unrecognizable the farther we travel from the sun.      That doesn't stop us from enjoying them!      Full moon is on Tuesday, April 7. The moon will be close to its monthly perigee, when it is closest to Earth. This will make the moon appear a little larger (by 14%) and brighter (by 30%) than when the full phase happens to occur close to the moon's farthest point, apogee.      Be sure to see the trio of planets in the southeast in the hour before dawn. From left are Mars, (which is reddish), Saturn and Jupiter (which appears as the brightest). Venus is extremely bright in the evening, in the western sky.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

APACHE COUNTY – With schools moving online and so many people working from home now, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that, more than ever, Apache County needs reliable, high-speed internet options. Towns and cities in southern Apache County have already begun working on the issue. St. Johns, Springerville and Eagar were awarded funds in January from the Arizona Rural Broadband Development Grant (AZRBDG) to complete development plans on how to bridge the “last mile” of Internet connection from the main fiber lines to residents and businesses. As each town studies their best options to connect their citizens to the Internet, a theme of cooperation is beginning to emerge.


  During the St. Johns’ Special City Council Meeting on March 25, City Manager Paul Ramsey gave an update on the direction the city is taking towards their broadband plans, which included working collectively with other Apache County towns, including Sanders to the north. It is believed that a combined application for the million-dollar “shovel-ready” RBDG grant from the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA), on behalf of the whole area, might have better odds of securing grant funds while also giving the region a better chance at high- speed internet solutions with redundancy.


  Part of the plan being considered is to run a line up from St. Johns to Sanders, where new fiber lines are being placed by the state along the entire I-40 corridor. Tapping into the new I-40 fiber lines would give a direct access to St. Johns, but it would also tie into existing lines, creating a loop that would provide redundancy for the White Mountains.


  “Currently, [fiber lines] connect to I-40 in Holbrook and goes south to Snowflake-Taylor, Show Low, Blue Ridge, McNary, the Greer area, Springerville and Eagar, and we’re the dead end in St. Johns. So, by making that [a] loop, if something were to happen in one spot, then it could come the back way and still be up and running. That’s the goal. There’s no details yet, but that’s what we’re hoping to put together,” Ramsey said in an interview. “There’s not completely been an agreement with Eagar, Springerville and St. Johns, but we think that can be done, because it effects everybody.”


  In addition to creating redundancy in the line, the plan would also tie in both the Navajo and Apache tribes, offering service options and redundancy to their areas as well.


  “Sanders was left out of the E-Rate project, so this, again, is one more benefit to them,” Ramsey said of the idea. “It just has a lot of built-in benefits.”

Feb. 26–Trump says that because of all the administration has done, the risk to the American people remains low. When you have 15 people, soon you have zero. We’re doing a great job. We have almost airtight containment.


  Around this time, Trump says the situation is a hoax created by Democrats to score political points against him; that the administration is practicing aggressive containment, taking it seriously; that one day it will disappear, like a miracle; that people are surprised he understands this, he understands it very well; that the warmer weather will stop it.


  Feb. 27–Stock Market drops heavily.


  Feb. 28–First U.S. death in Washington state.


  Governors and mayors, seeing that the federal government is not taking control, start to try to get supplies and ventilators, hospital space. They need tests for the virus.


  February–Test created by the CDC doesn’t work, so new tests are developed from scratch. They are not readily available. Trump says that anyone who wants a test can get it and that it’s a beautiful test. To this day (3/30), the U.S. doesn’t have enough tests, and turnaround time for results in our area is 5-11 days.


  March 13–Trump declares a National Emergency although he continues not to practice social distancing.


  The US lost over a month through lack of urgency to get tests made and distributed, excess red tape to get tests approved, and lack of leadership. South Korea, which had its first case at the same time as the U.S. did, jumped into widespread testing, took measures to isolate COVID-19 patients, and is much better off than we are today.


  Without the federal government handling procurement and shipping of supplies and equipment, governors work against each other to get what they need. Big states get some of what they want while small states can’t outbid them. The administration claims to have caused masks, gowns, etc., to be shipped out to health workers in huge quantities, but they haven’t reached our area.


  It is clear that supplies and equipment should be procured and shipped from a central source, the federal government, but Trump claimed that the government isn’t a “shipping clerk” and delayed use of the Defense Production Act which allows him to demand that companies produce what is needed.


  Now we are trying to slow the spread of COVID-19 by staying at home except when absolutely necessary to go out. We hope it works.

Social service providers around the country are feeling a similar squeeze, as they try to keep both clients and volunteers safe while facing a growing demand.


  Katie Fitzgerald, the chief operating officer for Feeding America, says their 200 food bank network has seen a huge increase — more than 60% — in the number of people showing up for help in recent weeks. But the number of volunteers has also dropped by 60%. On top of that, donations from grocery stores and other suppliers have dried up because of a spike in consumer demand.


  "For the emergency charitable food system in the United States, this is truly a perfect storm," she said.


  Some states are trying to fill the volunteer gap by calling in the National Guard. Others are turning to the 75,000 members of AmeriCorps. Samantha Jo Warfield, a spokesperson for the Corporation for National and Community Service, which operates the program, says many members had been working in schools that have shut down. They're now helping with food distribution. Others are manning emergency call centers, distributing homeless assistance or providing virtual aid by counseling students online.


  Warfield says Senior Corps volunteers, who are 55 and older, have also shifted away from their usual in-person activities, like taking other seniors shopping or to their doctors' appointments.


  She says instead, "they might be doing phone calls to check in on those individuals. They might be creating sort of volunteer efforts to make sure those individuals are still getting their food and prescriptions that they need."


  But not everything can be done virtually. Stephen Hitchcock runs The Haven, a day shelter and housing resource center in Charlottesville, Va. He says it's had to limit how many people it serves each day because all at-risk staffers and volunteers have been asked to stay home, leaving them very short-handed.


  Some volunteer-run programs at the shelter have also been suspended, including a clinic that usually comes every other week from the University of Virginia to provide medical and psychiatric care.


  Hitchcock also works with a group called PACEM, which provides overnight shelter space. The group has transformed an upstairs room at The Haven into a temporary shelter for women because the usual shelter sites lack volunteers and enough space to keep people 6 feet apart.


  Hitchcock hopes that if nothing else, the current health crisis makes people more aware of the challenges his clients face. "How does one socially distance if they don't have a home?" he said. "Ultimately what people need is a safe and stable place to live. And that, for me, is highlighted in this pandemic in a really, really clear way."


  Amanda Chesney, who runs homeless and housing services for Catholic Charities in Washington, D.C., is dealing with similar challenges and worries about the long-term impact as the crisis drags on. They've had to suspend volunteer programs that provide things like yoga classes and game nights, which might seem like luxuries but can be crucial for clients' mental health.


  "Right now, everybody's on a hunker down, focus on the now," she said. "But I think as time goes on, it's going to get a little heavier without those [human] interactions."

Social service providers that rely on volunteers are having to scale back operations, just as more Americans are coming to them for help.


  Julio Alonso, executive director and CEO of the Hoosier Hills Food Bank in Bloomington, Ind., says students from nearby Indiana University usually help pack and distribute food, but they've been sent home because of the pandemic.


  "In addition to those student groups, a lot of businesses come on a regular basis and volunteer for us as groups, and that has pretty much gone out the window," Alonso said.


  He added that even if such groups were available, they can't have too many people working together safely in their warehouse.


  So the food bank has completely revamped its operation. Staffers now hand out prepackaged groceries to people who drive up in their cars, instead of allowing them to come inside and select their food. The food bank has also limited warehouse access to the 100 pantries, programs and other agencies that help distribute its food.


  Alonso says some of those groups have had to scale back, too. After-school programs have shut down, as have a few smaller, faith-based operations. "A lot of the volunteers that they used are folks in their 60s, 70s, even 80s who are at risk," he said.

 Before the novel coronavirus brought society to a stop, some players were on the verge of winning championships, some were hoping to earn new contracts, some were in a relegation dogfight. Some of these footballers are multimillionaires of world renown; others live modestly and aspire to greatness. Not everyone is the same.

 "The higher level you play the more resources you have," says Dr. Duncan. "However, this process can be managed on any budget and often players in lower divisions have built up strong resilience and are used to managing with less support."
 Replicating the intensity of a match or a training ground session will be difficult, no matter what the resources on offer. But training at home is not pointless.
 "I have managed numerous players during isolation and it is possible to keep a sound fitness level. Of course, it is better to be in a team situation but this present challenge can be won," adds Dr. Duncan.
 William Rose is a fitness coach at AFC Wimbledon, a London-based club in the third tier of the English football league.
 Before the United Kingdom was put into lockdown, he posted on Twitter a home fitness program which he had devised for the 122 players in the club's academy and, to his surprise, his tweet was shared around the world, an indication perhaps that at the moment there are plenty of athletes, be they amateur or professionals, in need of guidance.
 Rose is attempting to make sure young players remain mentally and physically fit but, he admits, there are difficulties. While some players live in leafy Wimbledon, others are in central London apartment blocks. Space is an issue for young players trying to not only develop physically but technically too.
 "To be told you have to stay in for 14 days when you're an athlete who is running 30 kilometers a week, it's suddenly all quite daunting," Rose tells CNN Sport. "It's managing them from a physical point of view to get ready to play again but also keep them mentally stimulated to make sure they're not going stir crazy.
 "We can't expect them all to have a 50x50-yard garden. It has got to be specific to them so we have to mix up the drills and make sure each session is capable of adaptation.
 "They're used to doing hard, varied sessions, short and sharp, plus more extended runs, and you can't do that in the space they'll be working in so it's getting them to replicate aspects of what they do on a pitch but on runs down the park. But you can never truly replicate that so you can never truly replicate match fitness.
 "You look at the top tier teams, they will have players who have gyms in their house or a vast garden space where they can do the technical and physical programs.
 "A lot of the bigger clubs have the facilities to lend the equipment to players during this time off but lower down the leagues you don't get those resources so you can't just dish out a program that may not be attainable for them."
 Twice a week Rose and his team will be holding interactive workshops. The first class focused on nutrition, the next psychology.
 Footballers are accustomed to being provided for. Academy players at AFC Wimbledon will typically eat breakfast and lunch at the training ground, says Rose.
 Not only are players having to learn to train by themselves, but they are having to think about nutrition and, in some cases, learn to cook. For players from poorer backgrounds or children of key workers, it is another obstacle to overcome during an already testing period.
 "We're making sure everyone's checking in," says Rose. "No one has ever been so grateful for technology. We just can't live in this time without it."
 Like everyone else, footballers are learning to adapt to a new way of living. But with the numbers of deaths rising around the world, there must also be perspective. As Rose says: "People love football and it means a lot to people but, at the same time, there are a lot of things that are more important in these times."

On a dresser, police reportedly saw five pill bottles that all bore the name of the woman. Next to the pill bottles lying on the top of the dresser reportedly were suspect heroin stamp bags, some used and some that were still full of suspected heroin substance. Police advised EMS that the incident was a possible drug overdose.


  The affidavit said the stamp bags had the marking, “60 minutes,” on them. Also seen on the desk were stamp bags with other markings. Additional stamp bags also had straw stuffed into the stamp bag which reportedly indicated someone had been “snorting” the contents of the bags. There was also a white envelope lying on the desk which contained a large sum of cash. In total, more than 100 stamp bags of suspected heroin were located inside the room, the affidavit said.


  When asked what happened that night, O’Brien reportedly said he and the woman were in the bedroom and the woman “shot up” while he sat at the desk and “snorted” a bag of heroin. O’Brien reportedly said he went downstairs to get some food and when he came back to the bedroom, he put his head on her chest but couldn’t hear her breathing and her lips were blue. He said he shouted for help and called 911. Another man who was in the house reportedly came into the room and tried to get the woman onto the floor to perform CPR. That man told police that O’Brien allegedly kept pushing him away and not letting him perform CPR on the woman. The number of suspected heroin stamp bags that were located, along with the scale, the way the stamp bags were bundled into groups of 10, and the brick, is common with the selling and distribution of narcotics, the affidavit said. Police said the amount of heroin that was recovered is beyond what is reasonable for personal use.


  O’Brien was placed in the Clearfield County Jail on March 30. Bail, set at $50,000, was posted on March 31 and he was released. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 17 at Ford’s office.

This is an update of my initiation article on Weimob published on February 20, 2020. Weimob's share price has declined by -13% from HK$5.70 as of February 19, 2020, to HK$4.92 as of April 2, 2020, since my initiation.
 Readers are advised to trade in Weimob Inc. shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the ticker 2013:HK, where average daily trading value for the past three months exceeds $35 million and market capitalization is above $1.4 billion. Investors can invest in key Asian stock markets either using U.S. brokers with international coverage, such as Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab, or local brokers operating in their respective domestic markets.
 ## Database Sabotage Incident
 On February 25, 2020, Weimob announced that "the production environment and data of the company's SaaS business were deliberately sabotaged by a key operation and maintenance employee of the maintenance and operation department" which resulted in a "temporary unavailability of the company's SaaS products to the customers" on February 23, 2020. Subsequently, on March 3, 2020, Weimob disclosed that the company has "completed online restoration of data of SaaS business, and restored the data of 23 February 2020 and before." The SaaS business contributed 35.3% and 51.2% of Weimob's revenue and gross profit for FY2019 respectively.
 The database sabotage incident is likely to have a negative impact on Weimob's reputation. This could potentially increase the company's attrition rate for existing clients, and make it more challenging for Weimob to acquire new customers, especially those who place a strong emphasis on data security. It is also unfortunate that the database sabotage incident happened at a time when businesses were ramping up their online business operations during the coronavirus outbreak.
 Weimob is allocating RMB100 million as compensation for clients affected by the database sabotage incident, while the company's senior management, including the Chairman and CEO, will also put up RMB50 million of their own monies to compensate the affected customers. The clients have the choice either of receiving cash or be compensated with additional advertisements. As a means of comparison, RMB100 million is equivalent to close to a third of the company's net profit for FY2019.

A good Samaritan decided to use the $900 he'd been saving to do something nice for Detroit nurses on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
 Allen Marshall spent Wednesday and Thursday at an Exxon station near the Detroit Medical Center with a sign that said "FREE GAS FOR NURSES."
 "I just love them and I want them to know that," he told CNN affiliate WDIV.
 Michigan is one of the hardest-hit states in the coronavirus pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 10,791 cases and 417 deaths.
 Imran Al Samet works at the station and told CNN that Marshall had bought gas for between 50 and 80 people on Wednesday and Thursday morning.
 "There's a lot coming through," he said at about 11 a.m. on Thursday.
 Most of the nurses aren't coming inside the store, so he hasn't heard their reactions, but people were excited.
 "They're happy with it," he said.
 Marshall told The Detroit Free Press that he'd been saving the money to buy a knife-sharpening tool. His wife is an essential worker at Blue Cross Blue Shield, the paper reported, so he did the giveaway after he dropped her off at work.
 "Oh my goodness, that is so nice of him," one nurse, who wasn't identified, told WDIV. "That's so good. God bless him."
 When the money ran out, Marshall flipped his sign, which on the back read, "THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO!!!" He waved to passing first responders and essential workers.
 A woman identified only as Alana told WDIV that she heard about Marshall's good deed and decided to come help. She said her nephew is a nurse.
 "It just kills me every day to know that he's going to work. I don't know if he could get sick or what's going to happen," she said. "They're heroes and we need to do what we can to support them."
 She bought another $200 worth of gas and can even be seen via CNN affiliate WDIV's video pumping it for some of the nurses.

  Jessica Jackson, the chief advocacy officer at REFORM, told CBS News that masks will be sent to Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Rikers Island, and the Tennessee Department of Corrections.


  The organization said 40,0000 masks would go to Tennessee, 50,000 would go to Rikers Island, and 5,000 would go to Parchman. Another 2,500 would go to Rikers Island's medical facility.


  "It's a very vulnerable population," Jackson told CBS News. "We're really worried about the number of people coming in and out of the facility, and the fact that the people living there might be sitting ducks during this pandemic."


  Disease spreads quickly in jails because people live in tight quarters, and advocates have said the novel coronavirus could wreak havoc on prison systems.

Ghaziabad, Apr 3 (PTI) Six Nepalese nationals who are Tablighi Jamaat members were on Friday booked for allegedly staying at a mosque for religious purposes in violation of the lockdown orders, police said.
 The imam (cleric) and the manager of the mosque too were booked, they said.
 An FIR was registered against them under Section 144 of the CrPC, Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act 1897 and under the IPC for staying at the mosque as a gathering of more than four people at a place is prohibited in the wake of the lockdown, Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani said.
 The Nepalese citizens had arrived for Tablighi activities in the mosque in Pasonda village located under the Teela mode police station area, he said.
 They were sent to a temporary isolation ward created in an engineering college in Masuri town on Wednesday after medical check up by a health department team, Naithani said.
 Every year, over a hundred Muslims arrive at the mosque for Tablighi purposes.

Is it absolutely necessary? Most people say they know the difference between a want and a need, but that’s not always the case. Replacing your only mode of transportation would be a need. Upgrading to a newer, fancier car is not. If your car goes down for the count, you need transportation. Use your emergency fund to buy something affordable and reliable you can pay cash for. But don’t dip into it just to upgrade your decent car for one with a million bells and whistles.


  Is it urgent? Practice the art of patience whenever possible. If your home’s air conditioning unit goes out in the middle of summer, that’s probably an urgent fix. But hearing about the “sale of the century” at your favorite retail store? Grabbing the newest, hottest cell phone when yours works just fine? Nope!


  Your emergency fund is all about long-term security, not instant gratification. Don’t blow it impulsively, but don’t be afraid to use it when it’s really needed. Be wise, and ask those three questions. Check yourself so you don’t wreck yourself—or your budget!

Kieran Hebden (aka Four Tet) has an astounding knack for making music that is so distinctly his own, without doing anything the same way twice. Sixteen Oceans mixes the sleeker, more synth-based direction of New Energy (2017) and Morning/Evening (2015) with field recordings and tropes more reminiscent of new age music than any of its contemporaries. In signature Four Tet fashion, a good few of these tracks also have some ultra-cozy samples to give the music the very organic feel he typically fosters, but only a few songs really use them in a predictable way. The biggest moment of familiarity here is the brilliant "Baby," which chops up Ellie Goulding's vocals to a feverish dancefloor shuffle before giving way to ambience and water noise after two minutes. As a single this moment may have been a bit out of the blue, but in the context of the rest of Sixteen Oceans it's a commingling, a unison of club and forest.

Other leading countries developing ocean power technologies are Canada and the United Kingdom, both endowed with some of the highest tides anywhere in the world. Canada has a number of tidal energy schemes along its Atlantic coast, primarily in Nova Scotia, where scores of competing companies are testing various prototypes. The U.K. has more than 20 of these projects in the pipeline, some still in the research and development stage, but many now being scaled up for deployment.

First off, it’s clean and compact, featuring higher energy density than either solar and wind projects. For instance, Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in South Korea, the world’s largest tidal project with an installed capacity of 254MW, was easily added to a 12.5km-long seawall that was built in 1994 to protect the coast against flooding. Compare that to the 781.5MW Roscoe wind farm in Texas, which takes up 400km2 of farmland, or the 150MW-Fowler Ridge wind project in Indiana that sits on a 202.3km2 parcel of land.

Probably the number one thing is positivity and remaining positive no matter what happens, because shit happens. We’re devoted to keeping a smile on our faces and moving forward. There’s just so many times on my channel where I’m leading people into something as epic as I can make it and a head gasket blows or a transmission breaks. You take that hard sometimes, like you let down the world, and it’s all about positivity. No matter what happens, at the end of the day, if one of my viewers sits down after a long day of work and wants to watch a Cleetus video, I’ve got to be there and be doing something fun and having a good time. Positivity and good vibes are at the core of our channel for sure. We try to never have a bad time.

SHOW LOW — Two local men who tried to hide a large quantity of dangerous drugs in a magnetic container placed in the wheel-well of a vehicle found out the hard way that Show Low Police officers are always on the ball.


  Stephen M. Banta, a 44-year-old Show Low resident, and David W. Ramsey, a 49-year-old Show Low resident, were arrested March 25 just before 3 p.m. in the 1600 East block of the Deuce of Clubs charged with possession of dangerous drugs (meth), possession of dangerous drugs for sale, transportation of dangerous drugs and possession of dangerous drug paraphernalia.


  Police said an officer made a traffic stop for a minor violation and that during the stop a K9 drug sniffing dog alerted to the driver’s side rear wheel well of the vehicle driven by Ramsey.


  Inside the wheel well was a large magnetic container inside which police said officers allegedly found a more than usable amount of meth, a scale for weighing it out into smaller quantities for sale, and seals commonly used to package relatively small quantities of meth.


  Both men denied any knowledge of the magnetic container or the drugs and paraphernalia inside it.

Cleveland Cavaliers power forward Kevin Love was on "The Daily Show" and echoed Lillard's point.


  "We have the best schedule," Love said. "It's a scholastic schedule and you get summers off. I've done it for 25 years now of organized basketball, where it's September and October (to start) and if you go all the way to the Finals, it's through June and then get the summers off. We have it really good and that's not lost on any of us. Obviously drastic times, drastic measures, but would like to keep the same schedule and 82 games."


  One assistant coach told Insider that in addition to logistical challenges like the draft, changing the league schedule could have an effect on families.

Nic Brown, a 38-year-old information technology manager, spent 18 days at the hospital — seven on a ventilator. He was the Cleveland Clinic's first COVID-19 patient and has "more memories of the ICU than he cares to remember."


  "I had these horrible dreams and it was night after night of torment," he said in an interview. "There was a point I wanted to ask them to pull the plug. I couldn't do it."


  Brown was lucky. His condition improved after doctors treated him with a variety of experimental medications, and he was discharged last week. His lungs are still struggling to recover, and when he does ordinary things like stand up to check his computer printer, he gets winded. He also said he's experienced some vision issues and, earlier on, confusion. He would write something down, but it wouldn't match the message he intended to convey.


  "When you typically get out of the ICU at the hospital, you get all this support like physical therapy and speech therapy but when you are a COVID-19 patient, you get none of that," he said.


  With the risk of infection and social distancing orders in place, doctors say, many rehabilitation services have not been accepting patients recovering from the virus.


  Michelle Bryden, a 49-year-old engineer from Ellicott City, MD, was able to take advantage of that kind of support after her hospitalization for bacterial meningitis and sepsis left her on a ventilator for four days. She has been thinking about people recovering from COVID-19 as she approaches the first anniversary of her hospitalization, imagining what her path through the medical system would have been like if she had been alone.
