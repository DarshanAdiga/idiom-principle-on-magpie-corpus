With Marshawn Lynch returning to the fold, the Seattle Seahawks at least have some name recognition in their backfield.
 The Philadelphia Eagles? Not so much.
 That could make for an intriguing matchup when the NFC East champion Eagles (9-7) play host to the Seahawks (11-5) on Sunday in the NFL's wild-card playoffs.
 Despite a slew of injuries, quarterback Carson Wentz led the Eagles to four straight victories to close the regular season and claim the division title.
 Wentz, the second overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, will be making his first playoff appearance. Nick Foles led the Eagles to the Super Bowl title two years ago and to the divisional round last season after Wentz went down with injuries.
 "I'm grateful for my health, I'm grateful to be out here with the guys in these big meaningful games, playing into January," Wentz told reporters this week. "The last few weeks have been backs against the wall for us. Guys have responded and stepped up and kept making play after play. Just kept believing, and here we are playing into January and hopefully do something special."
 The Eagles clinched the division title with a 34-17 victory at the New York Giants last weekend in a game they finished without seven offensive starters.
 Miles Sanders left the game in the first half with an ankle injury, and fellow running back Jordan Howard played just one snap in his return after missing six games with shoulder woes.
 Boston Scott, promoted from the practice squad in October, ran for three touchdowns against the Giants and led the team in rushing (54) and receiving (84) yards.
 "The fact that I've had opportunities, (Eagles coach) Doug Pederson has had confidence in me, the coaching staff has had confidence in me, I'm really grateful to be out there, because I have definitely made mistakes, but it's been cool," the 5-foot-6 Scott said.
 The Eagles, who lost wide receivers DeSean Jackson, Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor earlier in the season, also played without Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz against the Giants. On the offensive line, two-time Pro Bowl right tackle Lane Johnson (ankle) didn't play and three-time Pro Bowl right guard Brandon Brooks suffered a season-ending shoulder injury.
 "We've had new playmakers every week, different guys stepping up because guys are getting hurt and banged up," said Wentz, who completed 67.6 percent of his passes for 1,199 yards, seven touchdowns and no interceptions in the 4-0 finish. "It's just fun to see guys step in big moments like that, guys who were on the practice squad. For them to step up in the way they have and for guys to make plays, it's been so cool to see.
 "I think that's what makes it that much more fun to do what we did, and then hopefully we can go do something special."
 Ertz, who is battling a fractured rib and lacerated kidney, practiced on a limited basis Wednesday but has yet to be cleared for contact. Johnson was also limited, while Sanders and Agholor sat out.
 The Seahawks, who were in position to claim the NFC's No. 1 seed entering the final two weeks of the regular season, closed with home losses to Arizona and San Francisco to drop into a wild-card spot and the No. 5 seed.
 They went 7-1 on the road this season, including a 17-9 victory at Philadelphia on Nov. 24.
 Seattle's backfield also has been decimated, with running backs Chris Carson, Rashaad Penny and C.J. Prosise suffering season-ending injuries in a late three-week span.
 That led the Seahawks to bring Lynch, who starred for them from 2010-15, out of retirement. "Beast Mode" electrified the home crowd with a 1-yard touchdown leap in a 26-21 loss Sunday night to the 49ers that decided the NFC West title, but Seattle was stopped inches short of the goal line on its final play.
 "It felt good, but at the end of the day, you know, I play to win," said Lynch, who rushed 12 times for 34 yards.
 The Seahawks will likely be without four-time Pro Bowl left tackle Duane Brown, who underwent minor knee surgery last week.

On Dec. 10, the Raleigh County Board of Education approved Michael Green as the next head boys basketball coach at Independence.
 “Being a high school coach is something I have always wanted to do. I have been around basketball my entire life, as a player at Woodrow Wilson in the early ’90s and as a coach for the last 10 years on the travel ball circuit,” Green said. “High school head coaching positions don’t come open very often. When this opened it sparked my interest. I am happy to have the opportunity.”
 While the opportunity is great for Green, it did pose some serious challenges, taking over one day after the regular season had started.
 “It posed a lot of challenges. While the challenges were stiff for me as a coach, it was the kids that were really behind the 8-ball,” Green said. “The season started for them Nov. 18 with tryouts and they went three weeks with really no direction.
 “(Assistant) coach (Scotty) Cuthbert has done a great job keeping this team together and keeping the team motivated, but there was no implementation of a system and no strategies. So when I got here mid-December, it was like starting from scratch.”
 Over the Christmas break, with school no longer in session, Green and the Patriots have done their best to make up for lost time.
 “During the break, we have been going three hours each day. Our motto is ‘all in,’ and the kids have bought in to what we are trying to do here,” Green said. “What we are working to do is establish some expectations of what we want this program to look like and we are setting the bar high.”
 Jared Cannady is the lone senior starter for the Patriots and he has become a believer in Green’s philosophy.
 “I loved coach Perkins, he was a great guy, but (coach Green) is more our style of play,” Cannady said. “He likes to run the floor and get a lot of shots in the game.

HOLLAND -- While tradition might be to ring in the new year at midnight, several child-friendly events celebrated a bit early for New Year's Eve on Tuesday.
 Since staying up until midnight is a tough task for little ones -- and can be hard on their parents -- places like Herrick District Library, the Holland Aquatic Center and more held "Noon Year's Eve" events and parties during the day.
 Herrick District Library partnered with The Holland Historic Trust and Boys & Girls Club of Greater Holland to throw a one-hour party at the Holland Armory. Party-goers wore celebratory hats while they sang and danced along with HDL staff, listened to stories, took pictures in front of a greenscreen, made crafts and played games until a countdown to noon and a massive launch of confetti.
 "It's a family friendly, fun event," said Sandra Lake, who attended with her children. "Since they're not going to stay up until midnight, obviously, it's fun to do a ball drop at noon."
 Alan Arroyo said it was he and his family hadn't been to a Noon Year's Eve event before Tuesday.
 "Not like this, not for the kids," he said. "It's a good idea. Whenever they (the library) have a fun event going on for the kids we tend to come out."
 Katie Finedell said it was nice to have a family friendly event to bring her kids to on New Year's Eve.
 "It's just something to do on New Year's Eve with the kids,' she said. "The library does such great events, we knew it would be fun."
 The Zeeland Historical Society held an Egg Drop at the Zeeland Historical Museum. Children worked to design a package with an egg inside with the goal of the egg surviving a fall from the upper floor of the museum.
 At the Holland Area Arts Council, children were welcomed to make crafts and party hats, play games and countdown to a balloon drop at noon.
 The Holland Aquatic Center held an early New Year's Eve party, complete with a 2 p.m. ball drop.

Naturally, the secrecy surrounding the creature the internet has dubbed “Baby Yoda” was an early ace in the hole, and without venturing into spoiler territory, it’s safe to say that it’s hard to imagine the series would’ve had the cultural impact that it did without the inclusion of “The Child” - whose species has been a closely guarded secret since George Lucas first introduced us to the scene-stealing Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back. (As a mostly practical effect, brought to life primarily through puppetry just as Yoda was, The Child is an absolute marvel that truly feels like a living, breathing, utterly transfixing creature, and I would die for him.) The Mandalorian’s first season doesn’t provide too many easy answers, but the finale does offer a much clearer sense of what Favreau and fellow executive producer Dave Filoni have in mind for Season 2, leaving us with a sense that now the scene is set and all the pieces are in place, the show is ready to make the jump to lightspeed.

In his first address to the crowd as mayor, Mueller thanked former mayors Buttigieg, Steve Luecke and others for their leadership and roles in “turning the corner and that South Bend is back on a positive trajectory.” Both Buttigieg and Luecke were present during the event on Wednesday. Mueller, however, said it is not enough to rest on previous accomplishments and he looked forward to “establishing a South Bend as a home where everyone can thrive.”
 “To realize a South Bend where everyone can thrive, we must start with an honest account of where we are so that we know what will be required of us to get where we want to be,” he said. “To achieve racial, economic and interracial justice, we must first acknowledge inconvenient truths such as existence of systemic racism, climate change and limitations within our free markets. The invisible hand of the marketplace cannot achieve social justice alone, only in conjunction with bold and deliberate public action can South Bend become a place where everyone can thrive.”
 Mueller then asked for the public’s help in this charge, saying it is necessary to take steps in the city’s direction by tackling issues on a united front. Mueller specifically pointed to topics such as creating an inclusive local economy, rebuilding neighborhoods, strengthening the education system and establishing greater trust in public safety systems.
 “Will you roll up your sleeves with me,” Muller asked the crowd, “and build a South Bend we all know we can be?”

President Donald Trump acknowledged late Tuesday that the ban would be announced “very shortly.” But he indicated that it might be short-lived and he didn’t say which flavors were involved.
 “We think we are going to get back in the market very, very quickly,” Trump said at a New Year’s Eve news conference during a party at his Mar-a-Lago resort. “We have a very big industry. We’re going to take care of the industry.”
 The administration’s decision is a partial retreat from a commitment it made in September to quickly devise a ban of all flavors except those that tasted like tobacco. Its plan to exempt menthol appeared to be an effort to dodge a bruising legal battle with the tobacco industry, and also reflected intense lobbying by the vaping industry.
 Administration officials also pointed to data that showed that teenagers aren’t choosing menthol-flavored pods or cartridges.
 Public health said the government would be making a good start in banning flavors most alluring to youths. But they said they feared teenagers would switch to menthol rather than quit vaping.
 “Flavors attract kids, and menthol is a flavor,” said Erika Sward, a spokeswoman for the American Lung Association. “It really helps to numb the senses and makes the poison go down easier.”
 Trump’s hesitation to put in place a full ban has become increasingly clear in recent months. In a televised White House meeting in November, he said he was concerned that a full ban would drive people seeking flavors to unsafe, illicit products. And his advisers, including Brad Parscale, his reelection campaign manager, have warned him that a flavor ban would hurt him with his base and could depress turnout in battleground states.
 Tobacco and vaping companies have lobbied lawmakers and the White House against banning flavors, including menthol. They have argued that adult smokers need e-cigarette options to help them switch from cigarettes — and that because 35% of cigarettes sold are menthol brands, taking menthol flavors off the market would pose a hardship for those smokers trying to quit.
 The companies also say that a full flavor ban would put thousands of vape shops out of business.
 Industry lobbyists seeking to protect flavors were joined by conservative organizations like Americans for Tax Reform, which opposed regulatory limits that they said would harm the small businesses that manufacture vaping flavors, retailers that sell them and adult consumers of e-cigarettes.
 Juul, which dominates the e-cigarette business, has largely stayed out of the fray amid public backlash over its role in the soaring rise of teenage vaping. Facing vociferous and legal opposition from parents, schools and public health experts, the company voluntarily took its fruit- and dessert-flavored products off the market, and has lost business to competitors selling flavors popular with teenagers, like mixed berry, watermelon and mango.
 Competitors have also been selling “Juul-alikes,” nicotine pods that fit Juul’s devices in flavors like Strawberry Milk and Peach Madness.
 Earlier efforts to restrict sales of flavored e-cigarettes stalled even as the popularity of vaping nicotine grew among millions of young people. The Food and Drug Administration first sought to ban sales of flavors during the Obama administration, but was rebuffed by the White House after fierce lobbying by tobacco companies and retail shops.
 The current debate over a flavor ban was set off by twin public health crises — soaring rates of youth vaping that experts feared was getting a new generation addicted to nicotine and the recent spate of severe lung injuries largely related to vaping THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana. More than 2,500 people have been hospitalized since mid-August and more than 54 people have died.

The new restrictions on flavors will not extend to THC-vaping products, which are mainly regulated by states that have legalized marijuana.
 Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, had announced in September after meeting Trump and his wife, Melania, that the FDA would draft a ban on almost all e-cigarette flavors, including mint and menthol. At the time, Azar said those two flavors appeared to be popular with teenagers, especially since Juul had pulled its fruit and dessert flavors from shelves.
 A more recent survey found mint was far more popular than menthol with teenagers, but public health experts say that teenagers will switch to menthol — which creates a cooling sensation — if all other flavors, including mint and mango, are taken off the market.
 Juul, the nation’s largest seller of e-cigarettes, has been the target of public and regulatory scrutiny over whether it marketed its products to lure teenagers and young adults to use them. Several investigations are underway into its sales and promotion practices.
 Some states have already imposed flavor bans, though some of those efforts have been forestalled because of legal challenges waged by the vaping industry and its tobacco company partners.
 In anticipation of a national ban, Juul had taken most of its flavors off the market. Until recently, mint-flavored products made up about 70% of its sales; menthol was 10%; and tobacco flavors accounted for 20%. Juul and Altria, the tobacco giant that bought a 35% stake in Juul last year, said they did not oppose the federal regulation of flavors.
 Reynolds American, which manufactures the Vuse e-cigarette, sought to exempt menthol and mint flavors from a ban, and the Vapor Technology Association, a trade group, has pressed to keep most flavors on the market.
 The Food and Drug Administration’s drive to end teenage vaping began more than a year ago, when a federal youth tobacco survey showed that in 2018 more than 3.6 million youths reported using e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days.
 The youth tobacco survey in 2019 showed that teenage vaping continued to rise, with more than 5 million minors reporting recent use of e-cigarettes this year. About one-quarter of high school students reported vaping within 30 days of the survey, up from 20% last year.
 The National Youth Tobacco Survey, conducted by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published last month, noted that nicotine exposure during adolescence could harm the developing brain, which continues to form until about age 25. The study also found that more than 10% of middle school students reported current use of e-cigarettes.
 For the first time, the 2019 survey asked students what brand of e-cigarettes they generally used. Juul was the overwhelming favorite. Fifty-nine percent of high school e-cigarette users said they usually vaped with a Juul, as did 54% of middle school users. The majority of e-cigarette users reported using flavored varieties, with fruit flavors being the most popular, followed by mint or menthol.

Star Wars has always been a pastiche of various genres and influences, but the franchise (at least since Disney acquired it) tends to come unstuck when it leans too heavily on the story beats and iconography of what’s come before without offering anything fresh, and that’s true of The Mandalorian too. The episodes in the middle of the season where the show leans too hard into Akira Kurosawa or Sergio Leone homages are arguably the weakest, while the episodes that bookend the season and advance the overarching plot have a clear-eyed focus and palpable momentum as “Mando” deals with one challenging, ever- evolving mission that pulls him in far deeper than he bargained for. Aside from needing the introduction of Gina Carano’s Cara Dune (a welcome addition who offers a bone-shaking authenticity to her fight sequences) in episode 4, you could easily watch episodes 1-3 and 7-8 as a self-contained and perfectly engaging Star Wars movie without missing anything important.
