As I thought about my increased fear around police, I thought specifically about the officers I’ve encountered in Corsicana, thinking of them and their families. I want them to be human. I want to recognize their needs, struggles, and aspirations.
 A concerning realization is that I am more like the murdering police than I care to admit. No, I’ve never killed anyone or even physically attacked anyone. But given a particular combination of circumstances, life experiences, mental circumstances, and detachment from God, I can do horrible things. I take responsibility for my spiritual, mental, and physical wellness to prevent those things from happening.
 This weekend, I prayed for Corsicana’s law enforcement employees. I thought of the sheriffs and officers in Corsicana who work around the clock to deter crime and identify the culprits.
 The police exist because some people won’t choose to do the right thing. There are horrible police officers in this country, and there are wonderful police officers who put their lives on the line each day and walk away from their families and children in service to the greater good.
 This week, I thought of my friends, family and neighbors on the police force, the once on the right side of justice, and I wondered what they are going through. I can’t imagine showing up at work knowing I was hated because someone else did something. I can’t imagine walking away from a spouse and kids to go to a job where people feared, hated, and disrespected me because of nothing I did. I can’t imagine being stalked on social media or receiving death threats for doing my job.
 I pray for my Corsicana law enforcement employees. I cannot imagine what you are going through right now. I hope I will respond to stories of officers committing heinous and criminal acts without hating officers who don’t.
 I am praying and resisting the urge to overgeneralize. I’m also looking forward to turkey this Thanksgiving.

The conversation that followed was a jumble of mathematics and emotion.
 The short version? For my entire life until that phone call, I believed that my parents’ wedding had occurred in March 1964, almost one year to the day before my birth.
 But now they had a confession to make: They actually had gotten married on August 15, 1964.
 And I had come along about seven months later.
 “We didn’t want you to feel guilty, like somehow being pregnant with you was the reason we had to get married,” my mom explained.
 A few months shy of 18 when she eloped from New York to Elkton, Maryland with my 18-year-old father; my mother passed away at the end of 2017, again too young for one of life’s milestones.
 My parents made it 53 years together and rarely spent more than a half day out of each other’s company, down to my mother’s final breaths in the intensive care unit.

Trump, who is obsessed with getting reelected, won't be bothering with Syria between now and Nov. 3. If he wins a second term, the mindless strategic drift of the last four years will persist. The endless wars won't end, in Syria or anywhere else.
 Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, obsessed with ousting Trump, will find it politically advantageous to make a show of striking a get-tough posture on Russia on the stump. This may well have real consequences. Recall President Kennedy, Cuba and the Bay of Pigs: Tough talk on the campaign trail can foster reckless misjudgments once in office. (Imagine, if you will, Trump's Twitter feed should a President Biden stumble into a military showdown with Russia.)
 McKenzie believes "there's no viable military solution to the conflict in Syria." Given that the American people have had their fill of ponying up vast quantities of blood and treasure for unwinnable and frequently inexplicable military campaigns, his judgment is indisputably correct. So what to do?
 Acknowledge the obvious. As with the larger war on terrorism, the U.S. military campaign in Syria has long since reached a dead end. The United States has far more pressing matters to deal with, much closer to home. So prudence alone dictates a prompt U.S. military departure from Syria. Sadly, in Washington, D.C., prudence has for years now been in short supply.

Career-oriented women tend to delay many aspects of their personal life while chasing their professional dreams. Increasing age means a decrease in ovarian reserve, this can prove to be a roadblock in attaining motherhood. A simple blood test lets a woman know her ovarian reserve within a matter of hours. Therefore, if you get your AMH levels tested at a younger age, you will have a better idea of your reproductive health. An AMH test can also help couples decide if they want to put their embryos on ice while they pursue other achievements on their timelines. It can also guide women who do not have a steady partner or are not married to decide to freeze their eggs thereby freezing their fertility in time so that when they do find a partner they can use their frozen eggs and plan a pregnancy thereby breaking free of the deleterious effects of ageing on reproductive outcomes.

Now my father sleeps with her ashes in an urn on his nightstand. He would sooner remove a finger than take off his gold wedding band.
 This year my parents’ anniversary fell on a Saturday. It was my turn to call, so I phoned in the morning. We talked about what my dad was watching on TV, the Chinese food he planned to reheat for lunch, the south Florida humidity.
 He has Parkinson’s now and dementia, so our conversation sounded like father and son talking, but not really. Sometimes he’s all there; sometimes not so much. This was one of those days where he seemed less than lucid, so I left out mentioning my mother. I didn’t want to upset him.
 This anniversary would have marked 56 years. There would have been a cake, seven-layer, chocolate with a cherry, which has always been a thing in my family. My brother and his three kids would have come by.
 My parents, always scrimping, never much for gifts, would have requested something practical, like a Shell gas card, but I would have skipped that for something more ostentatious. Maybe plane tickets to Arizona, or his and hers recliners for the family room where they liked to watch old episodes of Law and Order and Bonanza.
 I would have offered to splurge for dinner. My mother would have insisted on a few cheese pizzas from the takeout place up the street.
 Inevitably, Leibowitz anniversary celebrations involved at least one joke about the 30-odd years of “fake anniversaries” we celebrated before my parents finally came clean.
 Sometimes I kidded them about being glad for loose morals, otherwise I might never have been born. Other times, my parents would kid me about being grateful my father had such a low draft number for ‘Nam, or maybe an unplanned pregnancy wouldn’t have seemed like such a blessing.
 This year, there was only silence.
 Except for this piece and the one thing I never got the chance to tell them: That I hope I was the reason my parents got married. Because, truth be told, I can’t think of anything else I’ve ever done of which I’m prouder.

Underscoring the uneven landscape, manufacturers of transportation equipment said "airline industry continues to be under great pressure." Makers of machinery said "capital equipment new orders have slowed again."
 In contrast, manufacturers of electrical equipment, appliances and components reported "strong demand from existing and new customers." Similar sentiments were echoed by makers of chemical, wood and fabricated metal products.
 Fifteen industries including wood, primary metals and computer and electronic products reported growth in August. Printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal, and furniture and related products contracted.
 "Manufacturers tied to services hit hard by the pandemic continue to struggle," said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte North Carolina. "As the pandemic drags on... manufacturers, even those tied most tightly to goods spending, are hardly in the clear."
 For now manufacturing is chugging along, and also picked up across the world in August. Factory activity in China expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade last month, while manufacturing remained on a recovery path in the euro zone.
 Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
 EMPLOYMENT TRAILING
 The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 67.6 in August, the strongest since January 2004, from 61.5 in July. Fifteen industries reported an increase in demand. Only one industry said orders declined. A measure of customers' inventories dropped to its lowest level since June 2010, an indication that orders could rise further.
 The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories increased as did orders for exports.
 Though factory employment continued to improve last month, it remained in contraction territory. The ISM's manufacturing employment measure rose to a reading of 46.4 from 44.3 in July. This measure has now contracted for 13 straight months.
 According to the ISM "companies and suppliers operated in reconfigured factories, with limited labor application due to safety restrictions." It said "long-term labor market growth remains uncertain."
 Factory employment was already in decline before the coronavirus crisis because of the Trump administration's trade war with China. Its struggle to rebound even as orders received by factories are rising fits in with economists' views that the labor market is losing steam after being boosted by the reopening of businesses in May.
 The government's closely followed employment report to be released on Friday is expected to show 1.4 million jobs created in August after 1.763 million were added in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
 Even with manufacturing now in what some economists say is a V-shaped recovery, business investment remains lackluster.
 A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed construction spending edged up 0.1per cent in July after falling 0.5per cent in June, confounding economists' expectations for a 1.0per cent rebound. While low mortgage rates boosted investment in homebuilding, outlays on nonresidential construction projects such as office infrastructure and power fell, potential headwinds to manufacturing.
 Spending on public construction projects tumbled 1.3per cent, with big declines in education, highways and streets.
 "Public construction will continue to be held down as state and local budgets are squeezed by the pandemic," said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

But if you’re planning to take in that flick – or any others – be prepared to wear a mask.
 Unless you’re eating popcorn or some other munchies, you’ll have to wear one. Otherwise, you’ll have to either wait until Maricopa County relaxes its mask mandate – something not likely any time soon – or just go back to Netflix.
 The Arizona Department of Health Services last week gave the green light to Alamo’s and Harkins’ safety plans for reopening as the state weighs reopening requests from hundreds of theaters, bars and gyms.
 “That was a big step,” said Craig Paschich, co-owner of Alamo’s three theaters in Arizona. The Chandler and Gilbert locations are expected to reopen in a week or two.
 Harkins and Alamo were among more than 102 venues, gyms and bars approved for reopening early last week. Out of the 800 businesses that initially applied for reopening, at least 202 have been turned down.
 With benchmarks showing fewer cases of COVID-19 in Maricopa County, gyms and fitness centers to reopen at 25 percent capacity. But they are required to provide the state Health Services Department with an attestation of compliance with its safety protocols and post that in a visible site on their premises. More information is at azhealth.gov.
 The department issued an announcement encouraging people to report violators to either the state or county health department or even local police.
 It’s trickier for bars.
 Only those that convert to “restaurant service’’ can reopen.
 That means customers must be escorted to tables, groups limited to no more than 10, no standing or mingling, and limited waiting areas.
 And forget dancing.
 Paschich said the application process with DHS was relatively straightforward and not too burdensome.
 Patrons can expect to see many changes at all three locations as Alamo Drafthouse adapts to protocols to protect staff and patrons from the coronavirus.
 Staff and customers will be required to wear masks inside the theaters, but can remove them while eating popcorn or other items.
 Stickers will be placed on the floors of the cinema’s bathrooms to instruct visitors how to navigate the common space without getting too close to others.
 The Alamo theatres are part of a national chain of cinemas known for their large screening rooms that allow for guests to order food and be served alcohol during the show.
 Arizona’s Alamo locations will initially offer a scaled-down version of their food and beverage menu, Paschich said, and customers will be given disposable paper menus.
 Alamo’s online ticketing system will automatically place a two-seat buffer between every group of customers in order to ensure guests are seated at least six feet from each other at all times.
 If a guest starts to feel ill during a screening and needs to leave, Alamo says it will refund the patron’s ticket.
 Similar protocols are being introduced by Harkins.

By mid-July, taking a photo at the Portland protests became next to impossible unless you were resigned to taking a photo of 10 live-streamers crowding in for a good shot. It feels like every inch of the downtown federal courthouse is surveilled by people documenting the protests on social media, footage that police sift through to identify protesters to arrest later on.
 Every moment, a hundred cameras are focused on the police. But for some cursed reason, I cannot find a video of the moment they tossed me down the steps of the federal courthouse. To be clear, it was only a few steps. But hey, hot take: a few is a few too many.
 It didn’t matter to them that I was wearing a stupid bike helmet that had the word “PRESS” in a large font taped all over it; it didn’t matter that I was wearing the stupid badge that had an equally large “PRESS” on it. I am 5’4” and mindful not to make any sudden movements if a group of officers in full camouflage begins storming toward me. That didn’t matter either.
 I faced them with my badge in one hand and my cellphone held high in the other, walking backward slowly and deliberately. I knew where the few stairs leading down to the sidewalk were. _Don’t trip_ , I told myself. My thoughts cut off abruptly when camo overwhelmed my field of vision, and I went flying in the air. I landed hard on the ground at the bottom of the steps, cushioned slightly by my backpack, which is also marked with a stupid little sign that says “PRESS.”
 The first thing I saw after falling was a woman breaking from a shield phalanx to pull me up to my feet. She looked frightened; when someone’s lying on the ground, it’s a prelude to an arrest. “I’m okay, I’m okay,” I repeated, as though I were in any position to convince anyone of anything.
 I recorded the moment I was shoved. The camera’s vision whirls as my phone clatters to the ground. After I pick it up again and the image resolves once more, the camera shows the courthouse as I back away trying to regroup. My heart is pounding. I try not to breathe too heavily, at least not while tear gas canisters were still being shot into the crowd.
 The next day, I looked for other videos of when the police pushed through, other videos taken by other protesters, hoping for another perspective on the moment they attacked me.
 I had some luck. I found one where me and my stupid helmet bob into view for a few seconds. The camera looks away, perhaps so the filmer can turn and run, and then it flips back and I appear again for a second, still walking backward. I disappear from view when a fuzzy blur of protesters flees the oncoming wave of cops. When the image refocuses, the police have someone pinned to the ground — probably someone who had been standing near me — and are macing nearby protesters.
 And as for me and my dumb bike helmet? I’m gone. There’s no sign of me. Despite the sea of cameras, that moment vanished into the ether, like a thousand other far more violent indignities wrought on other vulnerable bodies. All I really have left are my scrapes and bruises.

Democrats in tough reelection fights can cite the chamber's backing "as a sort of Good Housekeeping seal of approval,” said Liam Donovan, a lobbyist and former GOP political operative.
 The chamber is also endorsing freshmen Democratic Reps. Greg Stanton of Arizona; Josh Harder, TJ Cox and Harley Rouda of California; Sharice Davids of Kansas; David Trone of Maryland; Haley Stevens of Michigan; Angie Craig and Dean Phillips of Minnesota; Susie Lee of Nevada; Antonio Delgado of New York; Colin Allred and Lizzie Fletcher of Texas and Ben McAdams of Utah.
 The person describing the chamber's endorsements would only do so on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the moves publicly. The decision by the chamber, which issued no statement about the matter, was first reported by The Hill newspaper.
 Earlier this year, the chamber said it spent six figures on digital ads opposing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in a primary that the progressive lawmaker won easily.
 Otherwise, all of the chamber's $2 million so far in the 2020 campaign on outside spending — money spent without coordinating with candidates — went to helping Republicans, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. So did all of the $40 million in outside spending by the chamber during the 2018 and 2016 campaigns.
 Yet the chamber’s much smaller, direct contributions to candidates have been more evenhanded, if politically pragmatic.

Arsenal strengthened their defence further ahead of the new Premier League season by signing center back Gabriel from French club Lille on Tuesday. The 22-year-old Brazilian joined on a "long-term contract," Arsenal said, for a reported fee of 30 million euros (USD 35 million).
 "He is a player we have been studying for a while and he was in demand from many clubs, so we are proud to have agreed and completed this transfer," Arsenal technical director Edu said.
 Composed on the ball and cool under pressure, the Sao Paulo-born Gabriel is regarded as one of the most highly rated young defenders in Europe. He helped Lille to a fourth-place finish in the French league last season and started all six of their Champions League group-stage matches.
 Arsenal has already signed right back Cedric Soares and center back Pablo Mari on permanent deals after loan spells last season. Another center back, William Saliba, linked up with Arsenal in the offseason having signed from Saint- Etienne in January before returning to the French club on loan.
   
   
 "He has many qualities which will make us stronger as a defensive unit and as a team," Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. "He has proved with Lille that he is a defender with many outstanding attributes and we are looking forward to watching him grow as an Arsenal player."

The $210,000 the chamber's political action committee has donated directly to 2020 candidates' campaigns has been split about evenly between Democrats and Republicans, the center's data shows. In 2018, about 2-in-3 dollars it gave to House candidates went to Republicans.
 The chamber has also contributed $168,000 this year to GOP candidates for the Senate and nothing to Democrats. Since it is unclear if Republicans will continue running the Senate, the chamber's contributions to Senate GOP candidates have more political weight than spending on the House, where control isn't in serious doubt.
 Some state chambers complained to U.S. chamber officials about the expected endorsements, arguing that the Democratic lawmakers did not have sufficiently pro-business records.
 Chad Warmington, president of the Oklahoma state chamber, opposed the expected endorsement of Horn, who was narrowly elected in 2018 to a district centered on Oklahoma City. Warmington said he believes Horn hasn't been supportive enough of the state's oil and gas industry.
 “A U.S. chamber endorsement can be persuasive in convincing voters that she's pro-business," Warmington said in an interview last week. “And I don't believe there is enough evidence to say she is. I was saying to them, ‘Stay out’” and don't endorse anyone.
 Alan Cobb, president of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, said he objected to the U.S. organization's expected endorsement of Davids, from the Kansas City area. Cobb said he prefers Davids' GOP opponent, Amanda Adkins, a businesswoman and former member of the state chamber's board.
 Warmington and Cobb both said they'd not been consulted by the national chamber about the endorsements.

A surprise decision to let Luke Shuey return to the field late in West Coast's 15-point AFL win over Essendon has been defended by coach Adam Simpson after revealing the injured Eagles captain will miss the remainder of the regular season.
 Shuey looked no chance of rejoining his teammates after he broke down with a right hamstring injury in the third term of Tuesday night's Gabba clash.
 He appeared to struggle during a fitness test at the final break and looked no better as he underwent speed drills early in the fourth.
 Simpson looked set to keep his first year skipper in cotton wool especially after the 30-year-old had been sidelined for 22 days earlier in the season with a minor strain in the same hamstring.
 Yet Shuey ran back out late in the last term to help West Coast clinch their ninth win in 10 games and remain on track for a top four finish.
 Simpson said the Eagles captain simply wanted to inspire his teammates and did not believe the fourth term cameo had further damaged Shuey's troublesome hamstring.
 "The way they sometimes react to hamstring (injury) is 'I can go at 80 per cent' - that was enough for us," Simpson said.
 "It got pretty tight there and he wasn't going to play for a couple of weeks anyway."
 "He's the first year as captain and he wants to do the right thing by the club. He represents us really well and he's the heart and soul."
 Simpson said Shuey was tipped to miss their remaining regular season clashes with Western Bulldogs, St Kilda and North Melbourne, adding to a list of unavailable players including Elliot Yeo (groin) and Jamie Cripps (personal reasons).
 Simpson was confident of welcoming back star forward Josh Kennedy (concussion) against the Bulldogs with Jake Waterman and Jack Petruccelle also a chance.
 But Simpson admitted the run home to the finals would be a test for his entire team due to the congested schedule.
 The 9.6 (60) to 6.9 (45) Gabba win was their third game in 10 days.
 "It's a battle of the fittest at the moment. We've got a game in five days against the Doggies - we'll back up and have a swing at them," he said.
 "We've got a routine in place with our recovery. Try to get your mind in front of your body is a bit of a theme with the boys.
 "(But) we looked tired, Essendon looked tired too and they had a soldier down too (Andrew McGrath)."
 Midfielder McGrath went down with a suspected ankle syndesmosis injury in the second term.
 It was another blow for the 11th-placed Bombers who have won just two of their last nine games as they try to keep their finals hopes alive.
 "It looks bad. We won't guess at the diagnosis, but it's a high ankle sprain which often end up being those syndesmosis injuries," Essendon coach John Worsfold said.

Americans have lots on their minds these days — a deadly pandemic, a devastated economy, urban unrest, a national reckoning with racism, hurricanes and wildfires and, at the highest levels of government, epic dysfunction. Oh, yes, and a presidential election. But they would do well to pay at least a modicum of attention to the latest plot twist in what used to be called the Global War on Terrorism.
 In accepting the Republican Party's nomination for a second term, President Donald Trump bragged, "I have kept out of new wars and our troops are coming home." That statement is nominally accurate. Indeed, on Friday, his administration announced plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops still in Iraq more than 17 years after the United States invaded that country.
 Yet Trump's claim is also profoundly misleading. In fact, his promise to end America's "endless wars" in the Middle East remains unfulfilled. Syria offers an illuminating case in point.
 The rationale for U.S. military involvement in Syria, dating back nearly a decade, has evolved. Initially, the aim was to assist Syrian militants attempting to overthrow the country's leader, dictator Bashar Assad. That effort has definitively failed. A subsequent goal was to destroy the Islamic State group. Today it no longer exists as a territorial entity, although thousands of insurgents remain at large.
 This partial success sufficed to persuade Trump that Syria was one endless war ripe for ending. In December 2018, he ordered the small American troop contingent there to leave, tweeting, "We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there." As is so often the case with this president, however, orders did not produce compliance.
 Whatever the intentions of the commander-in-chief, the Pentagon wasn't ready to call it quits. So rather than departing, U.S. troops simply abandoned their positions (and their Kurdish allies) in northern Syria, with just a few hundred taking up new positions in the eastern part of the country.

Factory activity is being driven by demand for goods used at home like electronics while capital investment remains weak. The ISM said manufacturers described sentiment as "generally optimistic, though to a lesser degree compared to July." The economy, which slipped into recession in February, suffered its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter.
 "The economy isn't back to normal regardless of what these upbeat surveys of purchasing manager executives are telling us," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. "Time will tell if companies should be more vigilant about expansion plans. Government pandemic stimulus programs are starting to sputter, and attempts to limit bankruptcies and foreclosures, and those paycheck protection schemes, are all set to fade."
 The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 56.0 last month from 54.2 in July. That was the highest level since November 2018 and marked three straight months of growth.
 A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11per cent of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 54.5 in August.

Balancing supply with demand to create true price discovery is about as capitalist and free market as it gets. What is socialist, friends, is taxpayer-funded welfare such as direct payments and heavily subsidized insurance. The current system we have in place now is designed to keep farmers hovering at poverty by dangling a carrot that’s 80 percent paid for by Joe and Jane Taxpayer, to string the farmers along to keep churning out the most affordable food supply of any developed country. Furthermore if supply management for dairy had been implemented in 2014 as it almost was, the rate of farm exits would have slowed – and the government would have saved more than $1 billion in total expenditures paid to dairy farmers in the form of insurance indemnities and direct payments.
 Many arguments against supply management for dairy display an undercurrent of greed and cognitive dissonance that reminds me of one of my favorite verses from the gospel according to Matthew – “Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but not the log in your own?”
 We all want better and more-consistent milk prices but don’t want to shatter our fragile egos by reducing production to make that happen. We rail against single parents, particularly in urban areas, receiving food stamps and welfare payments to keep their children fed and clothed – while conveniently forgetting the billions of dollars doled out each year, especially in 2020, to farmers of all stripes to keep growing and raising food that can’t be sold at a profitable price because there’s just too much of it already.
 I recall being at World Dairy Expo this past fall when U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said too much milk was dragging down farmgate prices. But in the same breath he refused to consider supply management for dairy. It wasn’t too long after that when he made his infamous comment that big farms will grow bigger and the small farms will go out.
 I want to hear how it’s supposedly un-American for dairy farmers to make supply management happen when it’s working all right for American farmers growing cherries, cranberries, sugar beets and potatoes. If balancing supply with demand is socialist, then does that make cherry pies, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and the sugar sprinkled on my lefse at Thanksgiving less patriotic?
 I can just imagine that kind of thinking now – “Hold that communist cherry pie, dear, so I can smother this slice of pumpkin pie in whipped cream that some poor dairy producer had subsidized to lose their shirt to produce.” That would really leave a sour taste in many mouths.
 Life is like a bowl of cherries and sometimes you have a bunch of pits. Heaven knows that we’ve needed to swallow our fair share of those the past five years. Some of the lessons that cherries teach can and should also be applied to cows, if we look hard enough. A better and consistent price for our products as dairy farmers would taste darned sweet if we could take a good look at what we can do to make that happen.

Investigating the August 25 murder of a former armyman in Sidhwan Bet, the police have found that the four accused has designed weapons especially for the murder.
 They had been hatching a conspiracy to murder Kulwant Singh, 46, for over a month as he was against the relationship between his daughter and their distant relative.
 The woman, Manpreet Kaur, and her lover, Baljinder Singh, alias Inda, were arrested for the murder of Kulwant, a resident of Salempur village, on August 28.
 Apart from the duo, their accomplices, Kuldip Singh and Sumit Kumar, were also arrested. Another accomplice remains at large.
 Through their interrogation, police recovered a sharp-edged weapon, a butcher's knife, a sword and an iron rod used to execute the murder.
 Inspector Rajesh Thakur, SHO at Sidhwan Bet police station, said during questioning, the accused revealed that they were hatching a conspiracy to murder Manpreet's father for over a month and wanted to execute the crime without fail.
 Taking no chances, they procured a butchers knife and replaced its wooden handle with one made of metal, so it did not break on attacking Kulwant.
 The accused also procured a sword and sharpened its edges. On August 25, they waylaid Kulwant near Canal Sports Complex and attacked him with an iron rod. After he fell on the road, the accused hacked him to death with the sharp- edged weapons. The body was later recovered by Kulwant's brothers.
 "All accused are facing a case under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Efforts are on to arrest their absconding accomplice," the SHO said.

Founded or unfounded, the number of complaints filed against companies alleging employment related claims are on the rise.
 Due to the duality of jurisdictions under which our employer-employment laws operate, the multiplicity of rules and regulations, and a continually changing environment, there is ample room for labor complaints to come forward, exposing employers to significant financial expenses to defend themselves.
 These types of claims, even when appropriate preventive measures exist to mitigate it, can harm the company, affecting its image, morale, and financial stability.
 To counteract the severe economic impact that these can generate, the Employment Practices Liability Insurance policies, better known in the insurance industry as "EPL," have been developed. This policy intends to protect the financial exposure that companies may have in the face of this growing wave of worker-employer claims.
 It is essential to understand that a worker-employer claim can have a significant financial impact on a company. That’s why each employer must evaluate ensuring and protecting their company from possible labor claims.
 Some of the most common lawsuits against employers in Puerto Rico include allegations of wrongful dismissal, discrimination, retaliation, and harassment-related cases, including hostile environment and sexual harassment.
 The employment harassment coverage becomes particularly important with the recent adoption of the Law to Prohibit and Prevent Labor Harassment in Puerto Rico, Act No. 90 of Aug. 7, 2020, in which employees from both the public and private sectors have a cause of action against those employers, supervisors or employees who engage in conduct known as workplace harassment.
 Aware of the complexity and unique challenges of all labor-related issues, AIG offers as an added value AIG Labor Consultation, a free service for all Insured clients with EPL coverage. It offers seminars and webinars on recent developments in labor legislation and risk prevention practices, as well as legal alerts that are sent by email about new laws and labor and federal amendments that may arise, to keep them informed.
 AIG customers also have access to a telephone line and email address for consultation with the law team of the Jackson Lewis law firm, which is dedicated exclusively to labor law in Puerto Rico. AIG Labor Consultation is an added value that complements the policy by providing risk management knowledge before using the policy. It is available to all types of clients, from small and medium-sized enterprises to financial institutions and multinational companies from various industries.

 There's no time like the present.
 There's no time like the present to make sure you're counted in the 2020 U.S. Census. That's the message we want everyone in Kansas to hear -- especially those families with young children.
 At Kansas Action for Children, we're paying attention to the Census right now for two big reasons. First off, the decennial count of every person in our country is used to determine how federal funds flow to communities. And those federal funds play a huge role in making sure that kids grow up healthy and strong.
 As the statewide Kansas Counts effort notes, missing even 1% of our population means we'd lose $603,990,400 over the next decade. That money supports Medicaid; the Children's Health Insurance Program; the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program; and other vital services.
 Second, the 2020 Census response deadline has been changed. It's now Sept. 30, which means that all online and mail responses, as well as door-to-door visits, must be wrapped up by the end of the month.
 This is a big deal, and potentially catastrophic. The accelerated timetable means that hard-to-reach populations, such as Black and Latino communities, rural residents and those living in poverty, could be overlooked by the federal government.
 These children can be more challenging to count for many reasons, according to the Count All Kids campaign. They can live in larger, multigenerational households. They may live with single parents who are working every day to get by. Perhaps they're not the biological child of their caregiver or live with extended families. Other members of their household may be undocumented immigrants and reluctant to respond. They may simply be renters rather than homeowners.
 We can't allow this to happen.
 In the middle of a pandemic, when state tax revenue is plummeting and residents across the state are sacrificing, Census-directed funding will be a vital lifeline. According to the Pew Trusts, programs using this data contributed an astonishing 32% of state revenue in 2017. That's right -- a third of state funds depends on an accurate Census count.
 How much could communities in Kansas lose?
 Where are we right now? According to the Census Bureau itself, as of Aug. 26 the Kansas self-response rate was 68.5%, with 20.6% of folks counted through follow-up. That means about 89% of Kansans are accounted for, which sounds good (and is indeed fourth best of all states). On the other hand, we're still missing more than one in 10 Kansans, including children.
 Our friends at the Partnership for America's Children put it so well earlier this month:
 \"The 2010 Census missed 2 million children under age 5 -- by far the largest number of people missed in any age group. When young children are missed in the census, it reduces the federal resources for their schools, their child care, their health care, and many other programs essential for their well- being. Missing a young child means reducing the resources they need to thrive for a decade -- most of their childhood.\"
 We all have to act to make sure our friends, families, and communities respond to this year's Census.
 By taking 10 minutes of your time today, you will be shaping your community for the next 10 years.

It’s loud and it’s in your face and it’s undeniable. America at large has had this ability to justify these killings. Now people are wondering whether this will actually bring change. We’ll see.
