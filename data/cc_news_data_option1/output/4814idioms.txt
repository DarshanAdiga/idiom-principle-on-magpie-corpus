But while there are some US adversaries waiting to see what the next administration will bring, a few of them may be tempted to try their luck. North Korea is a prime candidate - Pyongyang typically tends to launch provocative moves to improve its negotiating position while everyone is distracted... including US elections. After four years of Trumpian promises and little concrete gains to show for them, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may figure that the next few months are the perfect time to showcase his leverage, reset the playing field and remind Washington that his country deserves a prime spot on the upcoming US foreign policy agenda. Don't be surprised if we see a major weapons test of some kind out of North Korea over the next few months, especially if Kim worries that Biden won't give him enough love and attention.

“My concern is what this case count will look like two weeks from now, following Thanksgiving,” said Dr. Malcolm Butler, health officer with the Chelan-Douglas Health District. “People can still do their part to soften the surge in cases by celebrating the holiday with only those people in your household. Stick close to home this week and for the near future.”
 The health district continues to recommend wearing a mask around people outside your immediate household and limiting the size and frequency of gatherings.

This fall marks the 400th anniversary of the December 1620 arrival of the _Mayflower_ , the ship that carried 102 English settlers into the lands of the Wampanoag and their neighbors. When they crossed the bay from their initial landing spot on Cape Cod to what would become Plymouth, the settlers entered the much-longer history of the Native Americans, who were, of course, the "first" to reside there. This is not how Plymouth's history is typically framed, however. In the nation's lore, Plymouth has often operated as the de facto beginning of American history, demarcated by groundbreaking moments in religious freedom and democracy.

That, then, was the well-established regional holiday in antebellum America when Abraham Lincoln, during the Civil War, wanted to have a moment of national unity, or at least unity for the Union. So he declared in 1863 that everyone was going to celebrate this day of thanksgiving in the fall. Of course, he was doing that when half the nation was at war with the other half. The half that was on his side was the half that has New England in it, where they'd been celebrating this all along.

Outdoor antennas are great but can also pose a few problems when it comes to safeguarding them from the elements. Rain, wind, or even the sun’s very hot rays can do a number on them, eventually. Even if you purchase one that looks secure and is waterproof, you may need to go the extra mile of protecting its components, such as the screws and connectors. Also, be sure to inspect your antenna on an annual basis to make sure that it is working properly, and be on the lookout for any piece that may have eroded due to the elements.

 "We already know how precious health is, but I am a workaholic, and I do prioritize my work more than my health," she admitted. "In this situation, I absolutely kind of just thought, taking a steroid shot, or just taking Theraflu or Dayquil would help cover it, because I was in a competition, yo, and I was not going to let down. I really took that _too_ seriously more than my health, and then God taught me a lesson."
 "So the part of getting sick wasn't the upsetting part; it was actually just being depressed, because I let myself get to this," she continued. "For the last few weeks, I gotta be honest, I was pretty upset at myself because everything ended. I stopped shooting my favorite talk show every day and I had to step out of a competition, which is, I feel like I was doing good and I could have stayed in the running. But I had to give up!"

Washington, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 25th Nov, 2020 ) :The US plans to distribute 6.4 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine after it is cleared for emergency use, officials said Tuesday.
 That could start happening shortly after December 10, when a committee of the food and Drug Administration meets to decide on whether to green light the medicine.
 General Gustave Perna, chief operations officer for the government's Operation Warp Speed, told reporters some 40 million doses of vaccine would be available by the end of December.
 That figure includes another vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes for Health, which announced some preliminary efficacy results last week and is also close to applying for emergency approval.
 The Pfizer vaccine has ultra-cold long-term storage requirements of -70 degrees Celsius, and the company has developed special containers with dry ice to keep it cool for up to 15 days.

"The flaws reported are prejudicial to all the competing candidates and political parties and to each in the same way.
 "The reported failings, while regrettable, are not on a scale to have a significant impact on the result of the vote," he added.
 Meanwhile envoys from the West African regional bloc ECOWAS, present to observe the election, met with members of the opposition for "preventive diplomacy", a delegate of the mission told AFP.
 "It is certain that we are heading towards a crisis and things are likely to go downhill," the source said, adding that the delegates planned to meet with APMP members.
 the pro-Kabore parties have promised a first-round victory for the incumbent president as was the case in 2015.
 Kabore would thus avoid a second round of voting in which he would stand against a single candidate backed by a united opposition.

The University of Puget Sound in Tacoma likewise warns against "nonessential personal travel." COVID-19 tests are available, a UPS spokeswoman said, but added that a negative result is a fleeting snapshot and doesn't necessarily mean it's safe to go home. While most students are studying remotely this semester, around 300 are living on campus, and residence halls will remain open during the holiday break.
 Colleges are wise to take a firm stance against risky student behavior. It's not just about protecting the collegiate community; it's about protecting families with elderly, sick or other vulnerable members.
 The first duty lies with students themselves. If they're mature enough to attend college, they should know to wear masks, keep a small social bubble and get tested.
 A parent's fantasy world, however, seldom matches a student's reality. Not long after colleges reopened this fall, 19 of America's 25 worst outbreaks were centered in college towns. Fraternity and sorority houses have been a persistent source of infections at the UW.
 Higher education leaders have responded by urging students to meet testing guidelines and by setting consequences for those who don't. The University of Notre Dame is among the toughest; it won't let students obtain transcripts or register for classes next term if they fail to get exit tested before the holidays.
 But no amount of education or coercion will prove effective if COVID-19 tests aren't readily available.
 The UW had the right idea by expanding its Husky Coronavirus Testing program ahead of the holidays. The program is normally limited to enrollees who agree to clinical protocols, complete a daily survey and get tested if potentially exposed. UW officials temporarily opened it to anyone on the Seattle, Tacoma and Bothell campuses wanting peace of mind before heading home.
 Last Friday, however, the expansion was suspended due to "a large upsurge in testing for people enrolled in the program," said John Burkhardt, UW Tacoma spokesman.
 UWT, which is largely a commuter campus, doesn't have the same challenges as the Seattle campus; most UWT students live independently or at home. Testing is available for the 100 students living in Court 17, the school's only residence hall, as well as the limited number of UWT students and faculty doing in-person classes, Burkhardt said.
 Pierce County's mobile testing units are another valuable resource; they're scheduled for their third visit to UWT on Dec. 5.
 It's critical that Washington public health officials expand such efforts in the next month, and that education institutions leave no stone unturned providing access to tests.
 Perhaps college students will be OK staying put for a long Thanksgiving weekend. But there's no question where thousands are headed for the long December-January holiday break:
 Home sweet home. Ready or not, here they come.

After breaking into the league with the Lions back in 2007 when he was a top pick in that season's draft, Johnson didn't hesitate to put up great plays and amazing statistics. In his career, Johnson managed a total of 11,619 yards and 83 touchdowns and more than that, was a human highlight reel unlike many other receivers he matches up with on the list. That's similar to the impact Barry Sanders made. Out of Georgia Tech in college, Johnson was labeled as one of the freakiest players in the draft and he lived up to that distinction in the NFL at nearly every single turn right up until the moment he retired after the 2015 season. It's rare to see a player not only live up to his draft potential but exceed it, and Johnson did.

Chelsea reached the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday with two matches to spare after a late Olivier Giroud strike gave the Blues a 2-1 win over Rennes.
 The France forward's powerful header in stoppage time snatched the points for Frank Lampard's side after Serhou Guirassy had levelled Callum Hudson-Odoi's first-half opener.
 Chelsea were joined in the next round by Group E rivals Sevilla after the Spanish side won 2-1 at Krasnodar.
 Both sides are on 10 points, nine ahead of third-placed Krasnodar and will do battle for first place come the end of the group stage.
 Chelsea can concentrate on domestic duties, with Premier League leaders Tottenham Hotspur visiting Stamford Bridge at the weekend, thanks to out-of- favour Giroud, who has been tipped to leave in January as he seeks more regular football ahead of next summer's European Championships.
 Chelsea started strongly and should have been ahead as early as the seventh minute, when Timo Werner flashed Hudson-Odoi's low cross over the bar with the goal at his mercy.
 Their early dominance was rewarded in the 22nd minute following superb play from Mason Mount, who won the ball near his own area before spotting the marauding Hudson-Odoi on the right.
 Mount picked out his fellow Chelsea academy graduate with a long pass. The winger took two touches before slotting past Alfred Gomis.
 England international Mount was unlucky not to double the away side's lead eight minutes later when Gomis pulled off a superb save to keep out his close range effort following a Ben Chilwell pull-back.
 Edouard Mendy had a quiet start to his return to the club from whom Chelsea signed him in the summer, but the hosts got a foothold in the contest after a rocky opening period.
 James Lea Siliki shot over in the 32nd minute after the ball rebounded to him after Kurt Zouma. Rennes then began to cause Chelsea some problems.
 Mendy showed the difference he has made to Chelsea with solid saves from Guirassy and Damien Da Silva towards the end of the opening period.
 Chelsea thought they had added a second shortly after the break but Werner's header was ruled offside and Rennes continued to pose them problems.
 Mendy made the save of the night in the 73rd minute when he got his body in the way of a powerful Gerzino Nyamsi header, and then pounced to stop a goal on the rebound.
 Rennes thought they had punished Chelsea with five minutes remaining when an unmarked Guirassy thumped a header past Mendy.
 But Giroud pounced less than a minute into stoppage time after Gomis' save from another Werner miss bounced up, allowing the Frenchman to head Chelsea into the last 16.

“We are very grateful for donations of food - either canned or fresh,” Sister Maggie said. “We are blessed with a freezer so we are able to store fresh food. Because of the pandemic, some of our guests are careful about shopping and going out in public, so we provide them with donated gift cards which allow them to shop for themselves.”
 “We never know what people are going to donate to us,” explained Sister Libby. “But whatever we’re given, we pass along to our guests, whether it’s food, coats, gloves or household cleaning supplies. One woman recently told me that she’s always gratefully surprised by what is in the bag that she picks up here and often thinks after opening it, ‘How did they know that I really needed that?’.”
 Sister Antoinette said the entire team at Anna’s Place is always overwhelmed with gratitude for the generous donors. Although the Sisters of Saint Francis is the sponsor of the ministry of Anna’s Place, private donors are its lifeblood.
 “As soon as our shelves get bare, God sends someone along to fill them. I honestly don’t know how we would have ever gotten through these challenging times without support from The Connelly Foundation, the Foundation For Delaware County, the Billy Mock Foundation, and other generous friends of Anna’s Place, like Creative Financial Group.”
 Founded in 1976, Creative Financial Group, led by managing directors Robert Hagenberg and Francis Naselli,. is an investment firm located in Newtown Square with offices also in New Jersey and Delaware. Within the firm, a “Make Someone’s Day” committee of eight employees led by Tara Scibello-Rickards is dedicated to doing things to make employees happy, from random giveaways to socials and charitable events. This year, being different due to the COVID pandemic, the committee searched for a local charity that employees could support and chose Anna’s Place.
 Agents, employees and staff at Creative Financial, as well as the firm, have generously contributed to supply Anna’s Place with lots of gift cards for various food stores to help people in the community, Rickards said. Creative Financial also provided two hot lunch days this year, featuring Zac’s hamburgers, for 75 people each time.
 “I discovered Anna’s Place while searching the internet for places locally that we could help,” Rickards explained. “It sounded like a great organization. We haven’t looked back. We are on a mission to help. Sister Maggie and the other Sisters have been wonderful to partner with and we all feel good about helping them in such a worthwhile endeavor.”
 Last Thursday, Creative Financial provided Thanksgiving-style turkey meals with all the trimmings for 75 guests, prepared by Capozzoli Catering. From 3 to 4 p.m., guests, from infants to senior citizens, arrived at Anna’s Place to pick up the meals. Rickards, a resident of Holmes, aided by her co-worker Alaina Cannon of Swarthmore, cheerfully handed out the to-go meals to the socially distanced lineup of recipients, most expressing heartfelt gratitude for the gift of a hot meal.
 “We also have a Christmas holiday fundraiser well underway in which we are compiling 75 gift bags for the people of Anna’s Place,” Rickards said. “Each bag will include sweatpants, sweatshirt, socks, blanket, gift card and various holiday treats, We will be distributing these bags in early December. Again, all of the expenses for these fundraisers are paid for by generous donations from our agents and employees within Creative Financial and the firm itself.”
 When the regular Thursday eat-in lunches suddenly halted last March, the Sisters had a kitchen full of food of which they had to dispose so it wouldn’t spoil. According to Sister Maggie, the Sisters put a table outside and placed the food upon it so those in need in the surrounding neighborhood could take it. People “came out in droves,” and that is when the team at Anna’s Place realized the need was greater than ever and, in the spirit of Jesus Christ, they needed, and wanted, to be there for their neighbors.
 “In the midst of so much uncertainty - places opening and then closing - we have remained a faithful presence at the West End of Chester and no one is ever turned away,” Sister Maggie stated. “We have received private donations which allow us to have baby supplies available, toys and treats when children arrive with parents or grandparents, and gift cards which allow our guests to purchase what they need the most. At this time, we are not able to safely accept donations of clothes or home furnishings, but we appreciate any donation of food or gift cards and we are always grateful to be remembered in prayer.”
  Anna's Place is at 226 Norris St., Chester. For more information, email AnnasPlace@comcast.net or visit www.annasplace.org.

Not China. Chinese leaders are well aware that anti-China hawkishness is one of the few things uniting politicians in Washington these days, but some Chinese policymakers harbor hope that Beijing will be able to work more constructively with a President Joe Biden. And while there will be areas for collaboration going forward - climate change chief among them - that doesn't change the fact that the overall trajectory between the US and China will remain negative as the two economic superpowers continue to compete in trade and technology, even under a Biden administration. But China is too strategic to unnecessarily stir the pot so early; for the time being, China will stand pat.
