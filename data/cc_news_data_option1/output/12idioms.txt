Researchers have shown that a novel protein derived from blood cells that aid in clotting can be used as a therapy to improve outcomes following heart attack, an advance that may lead to new treatment for cardiac arrest. According to the scientists, including those from the University of Sydney in Australia, the protein, called recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-AB (rhPDGF-AB) improved cardiac function and scar formation following heart attack, and led to an overall increase in survival rate in an animal model.
 The study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, said infusing rhPDGF into subjects that have had heart attacks improves the quality of the scar, leads to the formation of new blood vessels, and reduced rates of dangerous irregular heartbeats. The scientists noted in a statement that following heart attack, the cardiac muscle is damaged, causing thick scar tissue to form, limiting the heart's ability to function efficiently, and increasing the risk of heart failure.
 Current treatments, they said, aim to restore blood and the oxygen supply to the heart as quickly as possible to reduce scarring. While this improves clinical outcomes, up to a quarter of patients experiencing their first heart attack will develop heart failure within one year. "This is an entirely new approach with no current treatments able to change scar in this way. By improving cardiac function and scar formation following heart attack, treatment with rhPDGF-AB led to an overall increase in survival rate in our study," said co-author of the research, James Chong from the University of Sydney.
 Chong added that while the treatment did not affect overall scar size, rhPDGF- AB led to increased alignment and strength of proteins present in the scar region, which improved heart function after the heart attack. However, the scientists said further research is needed to quantify safe dosage of rhPDGF- AB.
 "Then we can start looking towards clinical trials in humans very soon. rhPDGF-AB is clearly a promising therapeutic option, and could potentially be used alongside existing treatments to improve heart attack patient outcomes and survival rates," Chong said.

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party will also suspend campaigning for three days.As commander-in-chief, President Tsai and the cabinet team will focus on the rescue operations as well as clarifying the cause of the incident, it said in a statement. Tsai is seeking a second term against Kaohsiung city mayor Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang KMT party in the January 11 elections when Taiwan will also elect a new parliament.Han -- who will stop campaigning for two days -- and the KMT also expressed condolences to the victims. There have been a number of incidents involving Black Hawk helicopters -- purchased from the United States -- in recent years in Taiwan.In 2018, a chopper belonging to a government rescue agency crashed during a medical mission off outlying Orchid Island, killing six people on board. There were also two crash landings in 2016 and 2018 with no casualties.The chopper carrying 13 people disappeared from radar less than 15 minutes after taking off, according to Hsiung, adding that the ministry had set up a task force to investigate the incident. We are investigating whether the cause was environmental or mechanical, he said.An air force official said some on board were trapped under fragments of the helicopter without elaborating. The ministry has dispatched ground troops and rescue helicopters to the crash site in northeastern Taiwan.It had been raining in the mountains in the past few days, the mountain roads are muddy and very steep. We are racing against time, Chen Chung-chi, a supervisor of the operation, said earlier Thursday.

Harro Ranter, CEO of the ASN, said that, overall, the figures show a trend towards greater safety: "If the accident rate had remained the same as ten years ago, there would have been 34 fatal accidents last year.


  "At the accident rate of the year 2000, there would even have been 65 fatal accidents. This shows the enormous progress in terms of safety in the past two decades."


  The biggest crash of the year in terms of deaths was the Ethiopian Airlines crash in Ethiopia in March, which killed all 157 people on board. It was the second fatal crash involving the Boeing 737 Max plane. The crash led to the plane's grounding around the world, which is still ongoing.


  The crashes in North America included an Amazon Prime Air Boeing 767 in Texas in February, which killed three people, and an Alkan Air Cessna 208B in Yukon, Canada, in August, which killed two people.

The checkmates between Jawaharlal Nehru University JNU administration and students union JNUSU is continue even in the new year. As the university initiated the process to implement the revised hostel fee from the new semester, protesting students announced to lockdown the offices of cashiers and mess managers. The university administration came with an alternative arrangement for online submission of the hostel fee.This is to inform the students residing in various hostels that they do not require to visit their respective hostel offices for knowing their hostel dues. The hostel dues can be checked on the IHA Inter Hall Administration website. After making the required online fee payment and generating the receipt, students need to send a scanned copy of the receipt to a unique email id of their respective hostels given on the IHA website, said a circular of the University issued on 01 January, 2019. The concerned officer of IHA will check the receipt and provide the online clearance to the students, who have paid the required hostel dues. After completing the process, the students can visit their respective schools for fulfilling other requirements of the registration process, it added. The registration process for the new semester is open till January 5.Interestingly, in its reluctance to prove superiority, the university administration has made almost everything online but the registration process. The last semester witnessed several firsts in the history of JNU students were provided questions papers on their email ids, asked to complete answers from wherever and whenever they were comfortable with, sending the photos of answer sheets to professors on WhatsApp up and permanent deployment of the police in the campus to protect Administrative Block which houses the offices of the Vice Chancellor and the Registrar. The reason ongoing students agitation against hostel fee hike since October 28. As most of the students boycotted the semester examination in December, 2019, the university administration has decided to give all of them provisional admission in new semester with a condition that they would complete the academic requirements by January 20, 2020. In a circular on December 30, 2019, the university has asked the students to submit the hostel fee of Rs 600 per student per month for a single room and Rs 300 per student per month for double seated rooms. The BPL category students have been provided 50 percent concession. As the University Grants Commission UGC has decided to bear the amount of utility and service charges, this new category of hostel fee has not been implemented in the new semester.JNUSU has rejected the offer and demanded complete withdrawal of the fee hike. The students union has also alleged that the Vice Chancellor is following highly authoritative approach and seems to have no intention to solve the issue through dialogue. Though started as protest against hostel fee hike, the agitation of JNUSU took the form of a national protest against commercialization of education as more and more students unions joined the cause.

He went home to live with his family outside Dallas, and while he slowly recovered physically, he could not connect with his family, his girlfriend or his friends. He felt utterly alone, battling emotions he didn't understand. Often, he found himself weeping uncontrollably.


  "I was happy to be alive. But I was now instantly confused. It was like my sense of security, stability, everything had just been stripped like overnight," he said. "Is anyone going to get this?"


  His parents said that during the year Gorman lived with them, they tried to help without pressuring him.


  "When he was here we didn't talk a lot about his experience," said his father, Gene Gorman. "We just allowed him his space. When he wanted to talk, he talked. . . . We knew this was a huge healing process, both physically and emotionally."


  Gorman, in contrast, felt enormous pressure to move on with his life, get married, start working, raise a family.


  One friend told him: "Hey, dude. Ebola was last year. You need to get over it," he said. Others implied that he was not praying enough or sufficiently trusting God.


  Overwhelmed with guilt, he broke up with his girlfriend. When he tried to reconcile, she rebuffed him. Eventually, he moved out of his parents' home and cut himself off from his family.


  "What I felt was deep, significant, shame," he said. "Like a catastrophic level of shame."


  Too focused on their son's narrow escape from death, "we didn't know what to do. Everybody in this thing - Preston, me, [his mother] Esther, his brothers - we were in uncharted waters. We didn't realize the depth and the seriousness that Preston was facing post-Ebola," Gene Gorman said.


  Given Preston Gorman's history of depression, NIH had recommended that he follow up with a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication. But Gorman didn't find it much help.


  Of the 11 Ebola victims treated in the United States, two - a permanent U.S. resident volunteering in Sierra Leone and a Liberian visitor - arrived with the virus and died. The Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, infected two Dallas nurses, who were quickly treated and survived.


  Six, including Gorman, were medical volunteers who contracted the disease in West Africa, and one was an American freelance journalist there. All were treated in specialized hospital units and lived.


  Some of the survivors have faced challenges like Gorman's.


  "For the first 18 months, I struggled a lot. It was hard," said Ashoka Mukpo, the freelance journalist who became infected in Liberia in 2014. He said he fought anxiety and depression, "just generally feeling shellshocked. What the hell just happened to me, and where do I go from here?"


  Gorman said the only people who seemed to understand were co-workers who had been in Sierra Leone with him.


  "Our phone calls would frequently be two or three hours," added Larry Geller, a retired pediatric nurse from San Francisco who also worked with Gorman in Port Loko. "He was kind of in a feedback loop where his frustration and inability to move on was feeding his frustration and inability to move on. He was really in a dark place."


  Gorman believes that Partners in Health failed its "moral and ethical duty" to aid his recovery. He said the organization did not offer any help until he and former colleagues contacted officials there to express concern about his condition.


  The organization disputes that, saying it stayed in contact with him over the years, occasionally offering to help him find therapy. The nonprofit's human resources director also worked to help him secure workers' compensation insurance for his health-care bills after Gorman was initially turned down, officials there said.


  In late 2016 Gorman went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, though he wasn't drinking heavily, on the hunch that it was a place where he could air his problems. Someone there referred him to a therapist who specialized in trauma. Gorman began seeing him in late 2016 and still does.


  In January 2017, he quit his job and checked himself into a mental-health treatment center in Tucson, Arizona, for several weeks. It was there, he said, that he began to understand the difference in the ways trauma affected him and his family.


  "The family bonds while it happens, and they all feel close and tight," he said. "The individual comes back and goes, 'Well, why am I not a part of this?' And they feel worse and more alone."


  Gorman said he has forgiven his family but is not ready to reconcile. "I would hope that one day we could speak," he said. "I just don't know when that's gonna be."


  Last year, Gorman was befriended by Peter Hubbard, 68, who runs groups where men explore the emotions and expectations that affect their lives. Hubbard has spent many hours talking with Gorman. Other than therapists, he has made the biggest difference in Gorman's recovery.


  Gorman also has started attending a faith-based program that helps people change. He found a job he likes at the University of Texas urgent care clinic, with a supportive boss and time off in the summer. Bit by bit, he is reassembling his life.


  Early in 2017, Gorman went back to NIH and handed out copies of "The Body Keeps the Score," a highly regarded book on recovering from trauma.


  "I said, 'You need to know for your patients, when they come in here, if they have something as serious as I did, this is what can happen. And you've got to prepare your patients, and you've got to prepare your families for this.'"

British shares rose in the first trading session of the new decade as investors welcomed Chinas monetary policy easing to support slowing growth and U.S. President Donald Trump set the date for sealing a trade deal with Beijing.The FTSE 100 advanced after two straight sessions of losses to rise 0.8, with all sectors in the black, after China cut the reserve requirement ratio RRR for banks. Mining shares led gains, with Antofagasta and Glencore advancing more than 2.5 each, after policy action from the worlds top metals consumer.The move on the RRR had been well telegraphed but came as a welcome New Years gift, OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said. The FTSE 250 rose 0.5 though Tullow Oil lagged, plunging as much as 18 as results of drilling at its Carapa-1 well offshore Guyana disappointed investors.The results from the Carapa-1... are, in our view, a negative, Berenberg analysts wrote. They added that the four meters of net oil pay reported from the well was unlikely to be commercial. The broader sentiment was also bolstered after Trump announced a Jan. 15 deadlines to sign a Phase 1 trade deal with China, though markets still await concrete details of the agreement.As a result, oil prices climbed higher, leading heavyweights Shell and BP to further boost the blue-chip bourse. Despite the gains, trading volume remained thin, and Halley suggested that would be the case until next week.The New Year holiday falling mid-week means a real return to work for Europe, the USA... wont happen until Monday, he said. Thursdays gains came after two sessions of profit-taking and traders clearing the decks ahead of fresh bets in the new year and followed the FTSE 100s best run in three years.

 NEW DELHI, Jan. 2, 2020 PRNewswire -- Hemp oil is extracted from the plant called Cannabis Sativa. Despite the fact that it is a similar plant from which marijuana hemps infamous cousin, people have finally started realizing its benefits. The difference between the two is especially crucial for those who want to keep any mind-altering substances at bay on that note, it is important to note that hemp is the non-mind-altering version of the cannabis plant. Hemp oil is characterized with a low percentage of THC. THC is the biochemical substance that cause the mind-altering high state that everyone keeps talking about. Hemp oil has extremely low measures of THC Another interesting fact is that hemp oil is very effective in relieving chronic pain. The hemp seed oil is essentially the oil produced using hemp seeds and is full of nutrition, and thus can be consumed. It can be used to cook food or to garnish salad etc. Since hemp seeds are super-nutritious themselves, the hemp seed oil created from them contains the same health advantages. The cannabinoids present in hemp only in trace amounts are the biochemical substance that helps improve the well-being and health of its users. Many people claim that they have cured their depression, anxiety, OCD, and many such diseases by using marijuana. However, it is not required to follow the same method to get the same results, especially if one wants to steer clear of the illegal route and say no to having an altered state of mind. There have been several studies over the past few years affirming that CBD, the biochemical substance present in hemp oil, is full of nutrition, vitamins, and minerals, and has proved beneficial in getting relief from stress and anxiety. Some researchers, in fact, say that hemp oil may be the most advantageous compound for human body as well as mind. Hemp Oil is helpful in treating Arthritis Pain Ongoing investigations have demonstrated that cannabinoids have good anti-inflammatory properties. This implies that hemp oil will have an immediate and direct effect on any inflammation based health problems, for example, joint pain due to arthritis, rheumatoid joint inflammation, osteoarthritis and some more. Hemp oil has restorative and nutrition value, and it can be both used externally as well as ingested. Research is currently being conducted on pinpointing how exactly these compounds present in hemp oil help in bringing down inflammation and alleviating pain, particularly because hemp oil appears to work even when other medications do not. Consuming hemp seeds along with the application of hemp oil can help the arthritis patients get relief faster, as the nutritional value increases. To elaborate, you get nutrition by consuming the hemp seeds and get relief from pain through external application of the hemp oil. In addition to this, hemp is also effective for many other chronic health issues, including depression and anxiety as mentioned earlier. There are also an ever increasing number of studies that show hemp is also effective in the treatment of disease like diabetes, PTSD, alcohol addiction and other neurological disorders. The cannabinoids present in hemp oil help relieve the unpleasant symptoms of craving, pain, seizures, spasms etc. Fundamentally, hemp is one of the plants with the most nutritional and healthy properties, but most people are still stuck on the fact that it is derived from cannabis. On the end note, those looking for a good and lasting solution to relieve their chronic pain, hemp oil might be the try solution.

New Zealand sweated on the fitness of batting kingpin and captain Kane Williamson Thursday after he and Henry Nicholls missed the second day of training ahead of the final Test against Australia. Both are battling viral infections as they race to recover for the clash in Sydney, where the visitors are desperate to salvage some pride after being thrashed in the first two Tests.Spinner Mitchell Santner is also unwell and did not practice on Thursday, with batsman Glenn Phillips making a late dash to Sydney Thursday evening as cover. Its up in the air at the moment -- a couple of boys are a little bit crook, unfortunately, said opener Tom Latham, filling in for Williamson in his pre-match press conference.Theyre having today off, as well as yesterday, so fingers crossed theyll be right to go tomorrow. Its gone around the team a little bit which obviously isnt ideal, but fingers crossed, theyre resting up and hopefully theyll wake up tomorrow morning and be good to go.If they are not fit, it will leave New Zealand with big problems. Jeet Raval is the only specialist batsman waiting in the wings, but he has been out of form and was dropped for the last Test in Melbourne.They also have bowlers Todd Astle, Kyle Jamieson, Matt Henry and Will Somerville on standby. Coach Gary Stead stressed Phillips inclusion was precautionary and they were still hopeful all players would be fit.Were still hopeful Henry and Kane will pull through and we will give them every chance to prove their fitness, he said. Glenn has been in terrific form this season and has good versatility with where he can bat and the roles he can play, Latham said it would take a lot for Williamson to miss a Test.Hes obviously a great leader amongst this group and hes passionate about this group, he said. If theres any chance of him paying, even if its a small chance, hell certainly be playing. New Zealand need all the help they can get with the opening two Tests at Perth and Melbourne ending in heavy defeats inside four days.Australia captain Tim Paine has made clear his team has no intention of easing up despite the series being won, after winning all four of this seasons home Tests within four days.

The dollar snapped a six-day losing streak to add 0.2 on Thursday, the first trading day of 2020, pushing the euro off five-month highs while the offshore yuan shrugged off-reserve ratio cuts that could add 115 billion worth of liquidity. Trading may remain thin until Tuesday when most European countries open after Mondays Epiphany holiday but market players will be relieved the dollar navigated the thin-liquidity holiday period without experiencing the money market squeezes many had feared.But wariness remains that there could be a repeat of last Januarys flash crash when massive stop- loss selling swept through holiday-thinned markets. Japanese retail investors are seen to have gone into the Tokyo holiday heavily short yen and long high- yielding currencies, including the Turkish lira. Such yen moves tend to fuel wild swings in the dollar as well but traders may be better prepared than last year.There had been some talk of a possible dollar squeeze but U.S. rates have been calm as the Fed has been on top of the game and providing enough liquidity. So now dollar-yen is mostly moving in line with the general risk sentiment, said Lauri Halikka, fixed income and FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Phase 1 of a trade deal with China would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House, but uncertainty surrounds details of the agreement.Having ended December almost 2 lower against a basket of currencies, the dollar inched up to 96.55 while against the euro it was flat around 1.12095, just off its early-August peak of 1.1249. It ended 2019 almost flat. The yuan closed at 6.9631 to the dollar, its strongest close since Aug. 2, and its offshore version also firmed after an initial downward move after Chinas Wednesday move to cut the amount of cash that banks must hold, releasing 115 billion worth of funds to support the economy.But the move had been widely expected ahead of Januarys Lunar New Year holidays and after Premier Li Keqiangs pledge last month to unleash more stimulus. In terms of data, final purchasing managers indexes painted a slightly brighter than expected picture across much of Asia and Europe, with final French, German and eurozone readings a touch better than advance PMIs.

North Korea released on Tuesday the transcript of Kim Jong Un’s speech at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party, which lasted for four days until Tuesday, instead of his New Year’s address. In the speech, the North Korean leader put forward a route for a “frontal breakthrough,” which includes the continued development of strategic weapons, such as nuclear weapons and missiles and, and threatened to break the commitment to suspend nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches. However, Kim left a bit of room for dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea by saying, “The scope and depth of deterrence power reinforcement shall be adjusted depending on Washington’s stance toward Pyongyang going forward.”      Several signs of North Korea’s troublesome situation are noticeable in Kim Jong Un’s speech. He frequently criticized the U.S.’ ambivalent behaviors as “gangster-like” while making threats by saying that “the world will see new strategic weapons” and that “shocking actions will manifest.” At the same time, Kim admitted that North Korea is between a rock and a hard place by saying that it is true North Korea is in desperate need of an external environment favorable to build its economy.      As such, Kim Jong Un has not crossed the red line that will destroy the U.S.-North Korea relations despite his announcement to make hardline provocations. North Korea has not made the “Christmas gift” provocation last year even after putting forward the year-end deadline itself and has not revealed what the “new path” is although it has mentioned it from a year ago. In particular, Kim said that there is no ground for Pyongyang to be bound by the commitment to suspend nuclear and ICBM tests anymore, but did not explicitly mention that he will break the commitment or suspend negotiations with the U.S.      The path of a “frontal breakthrough” chosen by North Korea instead is practically an announcement to extend the tensions that have been in place since the end of last year. “The deadlock with the U.S. will be inevitably prolonged,” Kim said. However, he claimed that time is on his side based on the fact that North Korea’s nuclear power will become stronger and irreversible over time if the country will continue to develop nuclear weapons and missiles against the U.S. denying the ease of sanctions.      Such a situation will only lead to more severe sanctions against North Korea, but Kim Jong Un put the resulting pain upon North Korean people. He anticipated a “sustained period of poverty” by mentioning reviving the country on its own and self-sufficiency, while saying, “Let us tighten our belts to build a rich a powerful country on our won.” The measures put forward to achieve the goal are national guidance and management, internalizing a frugal mindset, and meeting deadlines no matter what, which are rather underwhelming to say the least. Despite Kim’s statement that said, “Dignity cannot be given up looking for a splendid transformation,” a national leader starving his people to death for his own dignity should not be allowed.

Nepals Supreme Court has sought within 15 days the countrys original map exchanged with India during the signing of the Sugauli Treaty in 1816 after a petition seeking the apex courts intervention to secure the Nepali territory. A single bench of Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal demanded the map from the Nepal government in response to the public interest litigation filed by a senior advocate who appealed the Supreme Court to order the government to start political and diplomatic efforts to protect Nepali territories. Nepal has raised objections after India released its new political map in November last year following the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir. Nepal claimed that Limpiyadhura, Lipulek, and Kalapani areas were shown under Indias territory even though they lie within the Nepalese territory. India has said the new map accurately depicts its sovereign territory and it has in no manner revised its boundary with Nepal.Nepalese territories including Darjeeling were handed to the British East India Company as concessions under the Sugauli treaty which was signed in 1816 on the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War. Under the treaty, the Nepalese- controlled territory that was ceded included all areas that the king of Nepal had won in earlier wars such as the kingdom of Sikkim in the east and Kumaon and Garhwal in the west.Although the Supreme court order was issued on Monday, the text of the order was issued only on Wednesday. The Supreme Court bench asked the government to furnish a written response along with a copy of the Sugauli Treaty-era map of Nepal within 15 days.The apex court has also asked the authorities to furnish other official maps either exchanged with various countries or with international organizations including the United Nations while applying for obtaining their membership. The government has also been directed to submit the original map exchanged while signing a Boundary Treaty with the Indian government in 1960, the map published by the East-India Company on February 1, 1827, and a separate map published by the British Government in 1847.The court has also asked the government to submit details of efforts made, if any, for amending the map of Nepal. The bench stated that the hearings on the PIL will be conducted in tandem with another similar petition filed by another advocate.Meanwhile, the Kathmandu Post reported that Nepal has proposed foreign secretary-level talks with India in mid-January on the boundary issue.

Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn decided to flee Japan after learning that his trial had been delayed until April 2021 and also because he had not been allowed to speak to his wife, sources close to Ghosn said on Thursday.
 Ghosn, one of the world's best-known executives, has become Japan's most famous fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a “rigged” justice system.
 Sources close to Ghosn said he learned at a recent court hearing that one of his two trials in Japan would be delayed until April 2021 from an original date of September 2020. There was not a firm date set for either trial, but at least one was widely expected to start in April 2020.
 Also read: Ousted Nissan boss Ghosn flees to Lebanon
 “They said they needed another whole year to prepare for it ... He was distressed about not being able to see or speak to his wife,” one of the sources close to Ghosn said.
 Under the terms of his bail, Ghosn was prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, and had his use of the Internet and other communications restricted while confined to his house in Tokyo.
 A request to see or speak to his wife over Christmas was denied, the sources said.
 The sources also said Ghosn was unnerved by news that his daughter and son had been questioned by Japanese prosecutors in the US in early December and was convinced authorities were looking to force a confession from him by putting pressure on his family.
 No one was immediately available for comment at the office of Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka or at the French embassy in Tokyo, or at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
 Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges, including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to car dealerships in West Asia. He denies the charges.
 The businessman, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, was smuggled out of Tokyo by a private security company days ago, a plan that was in the works for three months, Reuters has reported.
 Turkish broadcaster NTV said on Thursday Turkish police had detained seven people, including four pilots, after the country's interior ministry began an investigation into Ghosn's transit in Turkey on his way to Lebanon.
 ## SPARE PASSPORT
 Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday Japanese authorities allowed Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, potentially shedding some light on how he managed to escape.
 Prosecutors on Thursday raided the Tokyo residence of the former Nissan Motor Co Ltd chairman, NHK also reported.
 Japanese authorities have not officially commented on Ghosn's disappearance. Government offices are shut this week for the New Year holiday.
 Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan and Ghosn enjoys widespread support in the country of his childhood, where he holds extensive investments in banking and real estate.
 Sources close to Ghosn have said he met Lebanese president Michel Aoun shortly after arriving in Beirut on Monday and was greeted warmly. A source at Aoun's office has denied there was such a meeting.
 Officials in Lebanon said Ghosn entered legally on a French passport. But one of Ghosn's Japanese lawyers has previously said the lawyers were still in possession of all three of his passports, under the terms of his bail.
 Broadcaster NHK said Ghosn had been issued a spare French passport, citing unidentified sources, and carried it in the months before his departure.
 NHK said his lawyers applied to have the terms of his bail changed so that he could carry a passport in a locked case.
 The key to the locked case in which the spare passport was kept was held by his lawyers, NHK said.

The Ingushetia regional government and regional investigators said one officer died from injuries. There has been no official confirmation of a second police death.The attackers were Akhmed Imagozhev, a well-known arm wrestler, and Mikail Miziev, both residents of Ingushetia and Russian citizens. Miziev was shot dead by police while Imagozhev is in hospital, Ingushetias government said.The governor on Tuesday evening lambasted regional police, saying incompetence on New Years Eve -- a huge Russian holiday -- led to the incident, while negligence resulted in the death as the officer was not wearing protective armour. Ordering a boost in security measures, he said one of the attackers worked as a guard in the local culture centre.Investigators launched a probe into an attempt on the life of police officers, making no mention of terrorism as a motive. North Caucasus has been a hotbed of Islamic extremism after the breakup of the Soviet Union followed by two separatist wars in Chechnya, a region bordering Ingushetia.Many radical Islamists went to Iraq and Syria in recent years to join IS and other jihadist groups. The Islamic State group considers North Caucasus as part of its caliphate and has claimed several attacks, most recently on police near the presidential palace in Chechnya in June.Russian authorities frequently do not recognise these attacks as acts of terror.

 KIDSGROVE ATHLETIC warmed up for their clash with Leek on Saturday with a last-gasp winner at Carlton Town, thanks to the only goal of the game from Anthony Malbon who smashed the ball home in the 90th minute.
 The win moved Kidsgrove up to ninth place and well placed to make a move on the promotion spots.
 The game took a while to click into gear with little happening in the first half, the closest anyone came to scoring was when Richard Duffy headed a free- kick onto his own crossbar and then into the grateful hands of goalkeeper Kieron Harrison.
 At the start of the second half, Malbon cut in from the right, but his shot was sliced wide and then Kingsley Gyamfi put a curling effort over the Carlton crossbar.

 Hemp oil is extracted from the plant called Cannabis Sativa. Despite the fact that it is a similar plant from which marijuana hemps infamous cousin, people have finally started realizing its benefits. The difference between the two is especially crucial for those who want to keep any mind-altering substances at bay on that note, it is important to note that hemp is the non-mind-altering version of the cannabis plant.Hemp oil is characterized with a low percentage of THC. THC is the biochemical substance that cause the mind-altering high state that everyone keeps talking about. Hemp oil has extremely low measures of THC Another interesting fact is that hemp oil is very effective in relieving chronic pain. The hemp seed oil is essentially the oil produced using hemp seeds and is full of nutrition, and thus can be consumed. It can be used to cook food or to garnish salad etc. Since hemp seeds are super-nutritious themselves, the hemp seed oil created from them contains the same health advantages. The cannabinoids present in hemp only in trace amounts are the biochemical substance that helps improve the well-being and health of its users.Many people claim that they have cured their depression, anxiety, OCD, and many such diseases by using marijuana. However, it is not required to follow the same method to get the same results, especially if one wants to steer clear of the illegal route and say no to having an altered state of mind. There have been several studies over the past few years affirming that CBD, the biochemical substance present in hemp oil, is full of nutrition, vitamins, and minerals, and has proved beneficial in getting relief from stress and anxiety. Some researchers, in fact, say that hemp oil may be the most advantageous compound for human body as well as mind.Hemp Oil is helpful in treating Arthritis Pain Ongoing investigations have demonstrated that cannabinoids have good anti-inflammatory properties. This implies that hemp oil will have an immediate and direct effect on any inflammation based health problems, for example, joint pain due to arthritis, rheumatoid joint inflammation, osteoarthritis and some more.Hemp oil has restorative and nutrition value, and it can be both used externally as well as ingested. Research is currently being conducted on pinpointing how exactly these compounds present in hemp oil help in bringing down inflammation and alleviating pain, particularly because hemp oil appears to work even when other medications do not.Consuming hemp seeds along with the application of hemp oil can help the arthritis patients get relief faster, as the nutritional value increases. To elaborate, you get nutrition by consuming the hemp seeds and get relief from pain through external application of the hemp oil.In addition to this, hemp is also effective for many other chronic health issues, including depression and anxiety as mentioned earlier. There are also an ever increasing number of studies that show hemp is also effective in the treatment of disease like diabetes, PTSD, alcohol addiction and other neurological disorders. The cannabinoids present in hemp oil help relieve the unpleasant symptoms of craving, pain, seizures, spasms etc.Fundamentally, hemp is one of the plants with the most nutritional and healthy properties, but most people are still stuck on the fact that it is derived from cannabis.On the end note, those looking for a good and lasting solution to relieve their chronic pain, hemp oil might be the try solution.Logo - httpsmma.prnewswire.commedia818535HealthHorizonsLogo.jpgMedia Contact Jerin Johnjerinhelveticads.com, 9810750717, Helvetica Advertising Pvt.

Rivera, who spent the last nine seasons with the Panthers, including a season that took the team all the way to Super Bowl 50, was the NFL's Coach of the Year winner in both 2013 and 2015.
 But his Panthers side struggled over the past two years, due in no small part to the injury woes suffered by talismanic quarterback Cam Newton. It eventually led to his dismissal from the team after a disappointing 5-11 season that saw the Panthers finish rock bottom of the NFC South division.

Nobody knows, but lots of people are making educated guesses.


  No single factor explains our national dyspepsia. Complicated phenomena have complicated causes. But several trends are surely part of the problem.


  Economic and political dislocations caused by technological progress have been a source of unease and resentment ever since the printing press sparked the Protestant Reformation. But the pace of today's changes sometimes feels like more than humans were meant to process and adjust to.


  The decline of organized religion is a perennial scapegoat, particularly on the right. And although it surely is an important part of the story, we have a tendency to gloss over the fact that religion hasn't always been a source of social peace.


  These and other trends are part of the broader failure of our institutions -- political, cultural and familial -- to give people a sense of meaning and belonging. People want to be part of something larger than themselves, and when they can't find that close to home, they look to politics and ideology to provide a sense of identity they can't find where they live.


  Another source of national grumpiness is the plight of young people. Saddled with debt and lacking a clear flight path to the middle class, the young are increasingly skeptical of capitalism.


  Psychologist Jonathan Haidt suggests we've been raising our children to be more fragile and less tolerant of ideas they don't like or find threatening. I think he's right, but that's clearly not the whole of the problem (as Haidt would readily concede). After all, complaining about "these kids today" has been an American pastime since Alexander Hamilton was a troublemaker at King's College (now Columbia University). Also, more importantly, the angriest and most divisive people today aren't youngsters but oldsters.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes and Jerry Jeudy became the first Alabama player to top 200 receiving yards in a bowl game as the ninth-ranked Crimson Tide topped No. 17 Michigan 35-16 on Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl. Jeudy finished with six catches for 204 yards. Najee Harris ran for 136 yards and two touchdowns for Alabama. Shea Patterson completed 17 of 37 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown for Michigan.UNDATED (AP) — Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said on Twitter that he will announce on Jan. 6 whether he will enter the NFL draft or return to college for another season. Tagovailoa is recovering from season-ending hip surgery and has not played since being injured at Mississippi State on Nov. 16. He had surgery two days later. Tagovailoa, a junior, is considered one of the top quarterback prospects in the country. He seemed a likely top-five NFL draft pick before the injury. The severity of his injury makes his value more uncertain, though doctors who have treated him have said a full recovery is expected.TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tyler Johnson had 12 receptions for 204 yards and two touchdowns to become Minnesota’s career receiving leader and propel the 16th-ranked Gophers to a 31-24 victory over No. 9 Auburn in the Outback Bowl. Johnson broke Eric Decker's school record for receiving yards on his second catch of the day and became Minnesota’s all-time leader for scoring receptions on a one-handed, 2-yard TD catch that put the Gophers up 24-17 at halftime. His 73-yard catch-and-run put Minnesota ahead for good early in the fourth quarter. Minnesota finished 11-2, its first season with more than 10 wins since 1904. Auburn wound up 9-5.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — George Pickens caught 12 passes for 175 yards and a touchdown, and No. 5 Georgia defeated eighth-ranked Baylor 26-14 in the Sugar Bowl. Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer was knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter when the back of his head appeared to hit hard on the turf as he was taken down by two defenders along the sideline. Brewer was coming back from a concussion in the Big 12 title game on Dec. 7. Georgia's Jake Fromm passed for 250 yards and two TDs.UNDATED (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers end a six-year playoff drought in a big way by earning the NFC's top seed. The 49ers haven't been in this lofty position entering the postseason since 1997 when they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the conference championship. The second seed this year is the Packers. The wild- card round features the Seattle Seahawks visiting the Philadelphia Eagles and the Minnesota Vikings visiting the New Orleans Saints.

  The Riverside County Animal Services Department said it inspected the farm several times following the accusations but found no evidence of animal abuse.


  "We have actually had full cooperation from the custodians, they've allowed us to do a walk through and they see plenty of food," said John Welsh, a spokesman for the Riverside County Animal Services Department. "We have never walked across an animal that's abused or neglected, certainly not emaciated, we deal with this type of stuff all of the time and the animals seem to be of good weight."

However, Market Drayton turned things around in the second half with two goals in three minutes from Lucas Green-Birch and Ethan Stanton to lead 2-1.
 Newcastle battled back and it was McLean with his second which got his side back into the game with an equaliser from the penalty spot on 77 minutes.
 The game was heading for a draw until Market Drayton’s Joseph Thomas netted a 90th-minute winner to leave Newcastle third-bottom of the table and just two points above bottom-placed Wisbech Town.
 NANTWICH TOWN left it late for a second match running to emerge 2-1 winners at Witton Albion in the Premier Division.
 The Dabbers were staring defeat in the face at home to Stafford Rangers on Boxing Day when trailing to a Brad Grayson goal on 66 minutes, but Joel Stair and Sean Cooke both scored in time added on at the end of the game to win it 2-1.
 And it was a similar story yesterday. Danny Mitchley tapped home at the far post on 23 minutes to give Witton the lead and despite pressure from Nantwich in the second half it looked as though Mitchley’s goal would be enough to win the game.

"Hit the road, America! It will be another year where gasoline prices will be relatively affordable- but don't close your eyes- the price variation between stations and states will approach record levels. Never has there been a bigger opportunity to spend less, or to spend more, if you aren't checking prices before filling up," said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis. "In addition, motorists should be feel some comfort that for a sixth straight year, gasoline prices will start with a "2" in most areas amidst a robust economy, with thanks to U.S. oil producers for matching our increasing appetite for affordable energy, which also helps to act as insulation against unpredictable events including production cuts from other nations to keep oil prices from spiraling out of control."
