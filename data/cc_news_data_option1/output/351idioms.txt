It all helps explain the league's back-to-back 5% TV ratings increases — two straight years with an uptick after a two-year stretch (2016-17) during which the NFL's status as the king of American sports took a hit, due in part to President Donald Trump's withering criticism and, more broadly, to the league's problematic handling of a myriad of problems that came fast and furious. The league accounted for 47 of the 50 most-watched shows on TV last year.

cant believe...Blessed to have chance to meet you. RIP Legend."
 The Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs in one of the first NBA games following the tragedy, honored Bryant by each deliberately running out the 24-second shot clock in memory of the basketball great's jersey number. Paris Saint-Germain striker Neymar similarly held up the number 24 with his fingers after converting a penalty in Ligue 1 fixture against Lille OSC.
 The Philadelphia native was drafted in 1996 by the Charlotte Bobcats but subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers before the start of his of his rookie season. Bryant was the first guard to be drafted straight out of high school.
 During his illustrious 20-year career, Bryant was a five-time NBA champion, two-time Olympic champion, the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in the 2007/08 season, and an 18-time NBA All-Star.
 The two-time NBA Finals MVP was also never far from the entertainment world, maintaining a close relationship with a number of Hollywood stars, and in 2018 won an academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for "Dear Basketball. "
 While Bryant was a player that captivated basketball fans and pundits, he did at times court controversy on and off the court. Kobe earned the reputation of a callously competitive player, very demanding of his teammates, which formed the basis for his famed "Mamba mentality." In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault in Colorado. Ultimately, the criminal case was dropped. Bryant maintains that the sexual encounter was consensual, but nevertheless, issued an apology.
 Bryant is survived by his wife Vanessa Laine Bryant, and three daughters Natalia, 17, Bianka, 3, and Capri, an infant.
 The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are currently investigating the cause of the deadly helicopter accident.
