States are also working to expand the number of pharmacies, doctors' offices and other providers that can administer COVID-19 vaccines, to ensure shots are conveniently available.            But enrollment can be time-consuming, Reid said, because providers often need help filling out forms, getting technical systems working and going through inspections to ensure they can meet storage requirements. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F).            Given the hurdles, Reid does not expect smaller pharmacies to become COVID-19 vaccine providers.            Because of the likely need for two doses given three or four weeks apart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering ways of helping Americans remember the second shot, including issuing cards that people would get with their first shot, akin to the polio immunization cards many older Americans remember carrying.            Many people will likely need additional prodding.            In a rural part of South Carolina, one community health center is planning multiple reminders, including text messages and calls from health workers.            Still, "there will still be some that slip through the cracks," said Ann Lewis, CEO of CareSouth Carolina, which runs the health centers.            Distributing doses is another issue. The Pfizer vaccine, which could be the first to get the green light, comes in shipments of nearly 1,000 doses.            "A minimum of 1,000 doses makes it very difficult to get smaller facilities vaccinated," said Rich Lakin, director of Utah's immunization program.            Shipments might go to a hospital that is easily accessible to health care workers from multiple sites, Lakin said.            "They may have to drive to that hospital to get the vaccine," he said.            In North Dakota, providers receiving fewer than 1,000 doses will have them shipped to a state warehouse that can maintain the ultra-cold storage.            "We'll break them down into the smaller quantities and then drive them to the provider," said Molly Howell, the state's immunization director.            State and local health departments will break up and redistribute shipments of other vaccines, which are expected to require orders of at least 100 doses, for smaller providers that do not need that many. But even if distribution goes smoothly, officials worry people will not want the shots.            "If there's going to be any real challenge, to be honest with you, it's going to be convincing folks to get the vaccine," said Patrick Peer, who runs the Good Neighbor Community Health Center in Columbus, Nebraska.            So far, states have received far less money than they say they need for vaccine distribution, and it's unclear if any more federal help is coming. Public health groups estimate that an additional $8.4 billion is needed to pay for staff, data systems and outreach and supply costs.            In rural Minnesota this fall, masked nurses in traffic vests reached into cars to give passengers flu shots. The drive-thru clinic was a way to social distance in the pandemic, but it also served as a test run for someday administering a COVID-19 vaccine.            Carlton County has purchased mobile vaccination stations to prepare for similar mass clinics for the coronavirus. But county health officials are also suddenly dealing with a spike in cases, and many questions remain unanswered, including when a vaccine might arrive and how many doses there will be.            "It's all kind of up in the air," said Jenny Barta, a public health nurse specialist.

Wilson Fisk, better known as the Kingpin, is one of Marvel’s best villains. Kingpin is the crime boss of New York City. He has confronted the likes of Spiderman, Daredevil and the Punisher, using his expertly trained fighting skills, natural strength and imposing frame to beat these heroes. But beyond his strength, Fisk’s most powerful asset is his mind. He has an unsettling ability to find weaknesses in people and uses these to his own advantage. These characteristics have seen Kingpin work his way to the top of New York’s criminal food chain while keeping his public reputation as a businessman intact. He even managed to get elected as mayor where he outlawed vigilantism! His resources have also given him control of some of Marvel’s most dangerous villains, including Bullseye and Elektra. He has both fought and worked with Hydra and other criminal organisations. Kingpin doesn't explicitly want to take over the world but could casually take over the world if it gets him whatever he does want. Because world domination isn't his first priority, he doesn't always have the attention of superheroes and can continually get away with murder and other evil unchecked. The very human aspects of this character and his evil parts make him the best Marvel villain without superpowers.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

 Moravian College is in a two-week campus lockdown before students go home for Thanksgiving in light of a recent spike in students quarantining due to exposure to the coronavirus.
 The college shifted to Tier 3 of its safety plan Wednesday morning, which means all classes except required labs and clinicals are online, and all campus buildings are closed except residence halls. College officials made the call after the number of students quarantining on campus jumped from six to 27 in the previous day, and the campus had five positive cases in the previous five days.

President-elect Joe Biden, a lifelong Roman Catholic, spoke to Pope Francis on Thursday, despite President Donald Trump refusing to concede. Trump claims – without evidence – that the election was stolen from him through massive but unspecified acts of fraud.            Biden’s transition team said in a statement that the president-elect thanked Francis for “extending blessings and congratulations and noted his appreciation.” He also saluted the pontiff’s “leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world.”            Biden said he hopes to work with Francis on issues such as climate change, poverty and immigration.            News of the call came even as some Catholic bishops in the U.S. decline to acknowledge Biden’s victory and argue that the faithful should not back him because of his support for abortion rights.            On Tuesday, for example, Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, tweeted that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris support “the slaughter of innocents” at any point during pregnancy.            Biden has said he accepts church doctrine about abortion on a personal level, but does not want to impose that belief on everyone.            Biden has had several phone calls this week with foreign leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. They have congratulated him on winning and consider the election settled.            Having the pope on board, too, likely has special significance for Biden.            He is just the second Catholic to be elected president in U.S. history, and the first since John F. Kennedy. Biden speaks frequently and openly about the importance of faith in his life and attends Mass near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, nearly every week.            No matter their faith, American politicians are often eager to meet with the pope when traveling near Rome, though Francis declined to meet with Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in September, citing rules against such sit-downs during election periods. Francis last visited the U.S. in 2015.            Known for advocating for openness on issues like gay rights, the environment and religious tolerance, Francis has been embraced by some liberals as furthering their causes.            In its statement, the Biden transition team said the president-elect told the pontiff he would like to work together to further “a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants.”            The Vatican issued no statement confirming the call.            The U.S. ambassador to the Holy See is Callista Gingrich, whose husband, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has been among the vocal supporters of Trump as he refuses acknowledge Biden’s victory.            In the election, 50% of Catholic voters backed Trump and 49% favored Biden, according to VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.             _Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Advocates say the long waits compound the financial and emotional stress of veterans with applications in the queue. Many are struggling to make ends meet while dealing with mental and physical injuries.
 The Liberal government announced in June it was setting aside almost $90 million to hire 300 temporary staff to help process disability applications.
 “What we have to do is what I've indicated previously, to make sure that we digitize the files and co-ordinate the staff,” MacAulay told the committee Thursday.
 “And look, with that alone, we have started to reduce the backlog. And when we have those new employees come online, it's going to make a big difference.”
 Veterans' advocates and other witnesses later told the committee the government's plan falls short of what is needed. The parliamentary budget officer said even with the new hires, there will still be about 40,000 unprocessed applications in two years.
 “The proposal to date has been akin to addressing an amputation with a Band- Aid,” said Doreen Weatherbie, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, the union representing adjudicators at Veterans Affairs.
 Veterans’ groups have called for automatic approvals of disability claims, with spot audits to deter cheaters. Conservative veterans affairs critic John Brassard noted a similar approach was taken for emergency benefits to help Canadians during the pandemic.
 “This is a dire situation,” Brassard told MacAulay.
 “So if the government can move at the speed of light for (COVID-19), then why is it not moving at the speed of light for Canada's veterans and their families?”
 NDP veterans affairs critic Rachel Blaney referred to the COVID-19 challenges during the committee meeting, asking MacAulay whether the department has a plan to deal with an expected influx of new applications after the pandemic.
 “We have no control on what comes in. The only thing we can deal with is what comes in,” the minister said. “If there is a spike after, as I always said, our job is to make sure we provide the benefits for veterans.”
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 12, 2020.

Instead of winning big, Democrats barely won the White House and greatly underachieved across the board on all other measures. While feeling some pleasure with Joe Biden’s win, along with some anxiety concerning a Republican Senate, mixed emotions are not surprising.
 It can’t be said too often to Democrats that the Electoral College is not going away and in critical states the Democrats' message is not working. Trump’s message that he is fighting for Republicans and that the Democrats are socialists has taken root.
 Democrats may hear that as silly and uneducated, but 71 million Americans are saying Dems don’t care about them or respect their intellect or education.
 Republicans feared the worst. The loss of the presidency, the Senate and maybe substantial down-ballot offices as well. They lost the White House but otherwise did far above expectation. Feeling pretty good seems logical.
 Nevertheless, Republicans have serious problems. Nationally, Republicans may have only narrowly lost, but where they lost is ominous for them. The demographic changes the Democrats have been awaiting are getting brighter. Republicans likely lost Georgia.
 They lost Arizona by a hair, but still, they lost. Demographic increases in the Latino community loom large, not in their favor. Republicans did pay attention to the important Cuban community in Miami-Dade county in Florida, and in some specific areas of Texas, but the oncoming demographic wave continues.
 Republicans’ disconnect with people of color, including new immigrants, is a major fault line and will only grow in the future.

WASHINGTON — The White House race was in limbo in 2000 when outgoing President Bill Clinton decided to let then-Gov. George W. Bush read the ultra-secret daily brief of the nation's most sensitive intelligence.
 Clinton was a Democrat and his vice president, Al Gore, was running against Republican Bush. Gore had been reading the President's Daily Brief for eight years; Clinton decided to bring Bush into the fold in case he won — and he did.
 President Donald Trump has not followed Clinton's lead. As Trump contests this year's election results, Trump has not authorized President-elect Joe Biden to lay eyes on the brief.

We need to check on the Reno County Republican Party leadership.
   
 We're concerned.
   
 Late last month, party leaders selected Mark Steffen to fill the seat of the late Bob Bush until fellow Republican, Daniel Friesen, who ran unopposed in general election ballot, assumes the seat in January.
   
 The Hutchinson News' John Green reported 12 of 13 people who represent precinct committees in the commission district voted for Steffen, with one vote going to Friesen -- as a write-in.
   
 Green reported the selection was a secret ballot, but the 13 qualified to vote were: Wayne Jackson, Vicki Jackson, Ryan Patton, Deanna Stephen, Rick Barkman, Irene Barkman, Mike Sullivan, Gary Whitt, Linda Whitt, Paul Waggoner, Todd Trussell, Mary Kauffman and Susan Buttram.
   
 Steffen's selection was sent to the governor's office for the official appointment.
   
 This is a bad look. Not just for Reno County but for the state. If people can't get along locally at the county courthouse, how can we expect them to get along in Topeka at the Kansas Statehouse?
   
 We have a few questions for them.
   
 Why didn't you just place the rightly elected Daniel Friesen in early? It would have helped get him up to speed when he takes over in January. It could have helped with a smoother transition.
   
 Do you know what kind of precedent for other Kansas counties? We promise it's not a good one. Imagine if this went on in more populous Shawnee, Riley, Wyandotte, Johnson or Douglas counties. People would be furious and rightfully so.
   
 We wonder what the late Bob Bush would have to say about all of this? Would he approve of your actions?
   
 Why seat a man to the post for a little over a month and a half? What is there to gain from Mark Steffen in serving such a brief term? What amazing thing did he have to offer? The News reported no one offered comment but instead called for the vote on closing nominations.
   
 In our view, these Republicans did bad by their party and frankly by Friesen.
   
 In short, we know you can do better and we hope you will given the chance.

"We're fully engaged, and we've been providing our analysis," Hillman said in an interview this week. "That will continue to evolve as president-elect Biden continues to talk more about what their plans are as an administration. But this is an ongoing project."
 Expect a more multilateral approach than Trump, said Brian Pomper, an international trade consultant who spent four years advising former Montana senator Max Baucus during his tenure as Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
 "I think that the trade initiatives he has to undertake and he has to face he will think about through the prism of foreign policy," Pomper said.
 "The Biden administration's instincts are going to be multilateral, to be working more with our allies where we can."
 That doesn't necessarily mean everything the president-elect does on international trade will be diametrically opposed to his predecessor, he added: reversing course "is not as easy as snapping your fingers."
 It won't be easy to align trade policy with foreign policy, said Stephen Vaughn, who spent two years as general counsel to Trump's U.S. trade representative.
 If the Trump era has proven anything, he said, it's that it's critically important to take care of domestic political priorities before worrying about which of your trading partners might be left at a disadvantage.
 "We have a lot of workers who are very, very concerned about whether or not their kids are going to be able to live as well as they did, and that has to be a part of the challenge as well," Vaughn said.
 "If the U.S. economy goes down the drain, or the U.S. political system is sort of swallowed up by worker rage, we're not going to be much of an ally to anybody."

The OPR investigation centred on two aspects of the Epstein case — whether prosecutors committed misconduct by resolving the allegations through a non-prosecution agreement, and also whether they mishandled interactions with victims in the case.          The report concludes that prosecutors did not commit misconduct in their interactions with the victims because there was no “clear and unambiguous duty” to consult with them before entering into the non-prosecution agreement. But it says the lack of consultation reflected poorly on the Justice Department and “is contradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.”          The Justice Department’s internal probe also concluded that Acosta’s “decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.” Investigators found that although it was within his broad discretion and did not result from “improper factors,” the agreement was nonetheless “a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its investigation of Epstein.”          The investigation included more than 60 interviews with 60 witnesses and a review of hundreds of thousands of Justice Department records. OPR officials identified as subjects of their probe Acosta, three former supervisors in his prosecuting office as well as an assistant United States attorney involved in the Epstein case.          The report drew immediate condemnation from Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, who has questioned Justice Department officials about the plea deal repeatedly.          “Letting a well-connected billionaire get away with child rape and international sex trafficking isn’t ‘poor judgment’ – it is a disgusting failure. Americans ought to be enraged," Sasse said. “Jeffrey Epstein should be rotting behind bars today, but the Justice Department failed Epstein’s victims at every turn.”          The report concluded that Acosta had the authority as U.S. attorney “to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.” The office said its investigation had turned up no evidence that Acosta was swayed by “impermissible considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations” and in fact had resisted efforts by defence lawyers to return the case to the state for whatever outcome the state wanted.          The report also did not find that a well-publicized 2007 breakfast meeting with one of Epstein’s attorneys led to the non-prosecution agreement — which had been signed weeks earlier — “or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.” Records reviewed by the office show that prosecutors weighed concerns about witness credibility and the impact of a trial on victims, as well as Acosta’s concerns about the Justice Department’s proper role in prosecuting solicitation crimes.          “Accordingly,” the report said, “OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.”

But when regular staff returned, they realized those residents had previously been faring much better, but had seen a precipitous drop in their condition.
 Martin said the soldiers also witnessed a shortage of basic supplies, like those for wound care.
 "When you have staffing levels at 20 per cent or even 30 per cent, the normal individuals that are responsible to restock those shelves -- restock and reorder the supplies -- becomes problematic because nobody knows who is actually ordering until there is a shortage of supplies," she said.
 And even when those shelves were stocked, she said, workers had to ask permission to use the supplies -- something the military clinicians weren't used to.
 "(They were) sometimes being asked, 'Well, why do you require this?'"
 As Martin wrapped up her testimony, which was conducted behind closed doors on Oct. 29 but was later released as a transcript, Marrocco thanked her and the soldiers who went to the facilities.
 "It's not enough to extend the commission's thanks to the men and women who did this," he said. "But it's very clear that this situation would have -- at least in respect of the homes where you were -- would have spun out of control if it hadn't been for your arrival, so thank you," he said.
 Testimony given two weeks earlier by Brig.-Gen. Conrad Mialkowski revealed that this was the first time in Canadian military history that soldiers were sent on such a mission.
 "That assistance was unique to our domestic operations history and demonstrated our own agility how to face this challenge," said Mialkowski, commander of the central joint task force.
 Several hundred people were deployed to long-term care homes in both Ontario and Quebec, he noted.
 Martin said that initially, those people were all medical technicians and registered nurses. But a second wave of personnel included others with a clinical background: physicians' assistant, dentists and dental technicians who were all trained in how to care for residents.
 Soldiers without a clinical background were also sent to the facilities, she said, and helped with things like laundry and housekeeping so that the clinicians could focus on resident care.
 "I think that there is an opportunity to look at creative solutions -- be it families, volunteers, et cetera -- to do some of those peripheral tasks that really were key enablers to the clinicians to be able to do their job effectively," she said.

That announcement came as Biden, now US President-elect, was visiting Israel, provoking fierce US opposition and souring ties with Washington for months.            “After straining relations with Biden and the US in 2010 over the approval of settlement units in Ramat Shlomo, one would think that Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu would at least try not to remind the incoming Biden administration of that time,” Peace Now spokesman Brian Reeves said.            “Approving units in the exact same location, just as Biden is about to enter office, is both counter to Israel’s interests and recklessly provocative toward Biden personally.”            Israeli public radio put the number of homes approved in Ramat Shlomo at 108.            President Donald Trump broke with decades of US practice by not criticising Zionist illegal housing units in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem or the occupied West Bank.            Right-wing groups in Israel have raised fears a Biden administration will renew criticism of settlements.            The left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz said on Thursday that the Jerusalem municipality was deliberately pushing construction while settlement-friendly Trump is still in office.            “Jerusalem City Hall and the Israel Lands Authority have been identifying and expediting approval of building plans,” the paper wrote.            “Once the administration in Washington changes, the municipality and the Lands Authority expect a construction freeze.”            Israel captured mainly Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day war and later annexed it, in a move not recognised by the international community.                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

"The president-elect has been quite clear that trade policy begins at home," said Robert Holleyman, a trade lawyer and former deputy U.S. trade representative in the final years of the Obama administration.
 Biden will be focused on ensuring domestic investments, procurement efforts and tax policy are focused on generating benefits for those in the U.S. who have felt left behind by the global economy, Holleyman said.
 "We cannot simply look at trade in a vacuum; it has to be part of this domestic discussion … it needs at the end of the day to return the right results for American taxpayers and citizens."
 Biden has promised stiff new tax penalties on companies that manufacture U.S.-bound products outside the country, incentives to keep jobs on U.S. soil and penalties for companies that "offshore" jobs and facilities to lower their tax bills.
 He also plans to more strictly enforce, expand and tighten Buy American provisions, make U.S. products more competitive, lengthen the list of "critical materials" that must be American-made and establish a "Made in America" office in the White House.
 Canada fully hopes to negotiate waivers to those rules, much as they did in 2010 when Biden, as vice-president, oversaw the implementation of President Barack Obama's Recovery Act, which included stringent new Buy American restrictions.
 The Canadian Embassy has been watching both the presidential and down-ballot House and Senate campaigns closely in order to assess the potential implications, said Kirsten Hillman, Canada's envoy to Washington.

The relationship between Salter and the Tennessee coaching staff is as ‘strong as ever’ as the two sides talk on the phone daily and exchange text messages when not. The Vol commit frequently speaks with Jeremy Pruitt and Chris Weinke and makes sure both sides are caught up to speed.
 “It makes me feel good to see the effort they continue to make,” Salter said of the coaching staff. “It shows how much I mean to the program.”
 Despite the up-and-down play of the 2020 Vols on the field, incoming recruits such as the dual-threat quarterback are still picking up positives on Saturdays.
 “I can really tell the coaching staff is putting the best players out there,” Salter said. “They are all working hard. It shows a lot that even when they lose, they are fighting and giving it their all every single game.”
 The four-star is having a fine senior year so far for Cedar Hill.
 Salter, who quarterbacks a MaxPreps top-25 nationally-ranked team, accounted for nearly 400 yards of total offense with six touchdowns in a 49-42 win over DeSoto last Friday night.
 Salter plans to sign in December and enroll for the spring semester in Knoxville.

If it attracts sicker people with preexisting conditions, that would reduce the risk level of private plans, which in theory would incentivize them to cut prices.
 By the same token, if a cheaper public option attracted younger, healthier people, that too could push private plans to be more competitive in hopes of winning back the most profitable of customers.
 “There are a number of different scenarios,” Gaynor said. “The details are really going to matter.”
 The general sense among many healthcare experts is that a public option would be a no-go with Republicans because it would make things tougher for private insurers (not to mention it would represent a reversal from past opposition to the proposal).

Halperin filed a complaint with the DOT, the first step to take in a refund battle ( _lat.ms/DOTcomplaintform_ ). Eventually, he received, by email, a settlement agreement from Air Canada.
 Within the text, full of “Hey, this was all outside our control” and “We’re complying with Canadian rules, for heaven’s sake” and “But we’re good guys and want to be your BFF” is this gem: Halperin will get a refund, the document says, if he will agree to “withdraw his/her complaint with the DOT.”
 Yes, the settlement form really says that Air Canada will refund Halperin’s money only if Halperin un-complains to the DOT.
 I asked the DOT and Air Canada for their thoughts. The DOT reiterated that “U.S. and foreign air carriers have a longstanding obligation to provide a prompt refund to a ticketed passenger, including those with non-refundable tickets” if the airline canceled the flight, which it did. It notes too that the DOT told carriers in an enforcement notice on April 3 and May 12 that these are the rules.

 We need to check on the Reno County Republican Party leadership.
 We're concerned.
 Late last month, party leaders selected Mark Steffen to fill the seat of the late Bob Bush until fellow Republican, Daniel Friesen, who ran unopposed in general election ballot, assumes the seat in January.
 The Hutchinson News' John Green reported 12 of 13 people who represent precinct committees in the commission district voted for Steffen, with one vote going to Friesen -- as a write-in.
 Green reported the selection was a secret ballot, but the 13 qualified to vote were: Wayne Jackson, Vicki Jackson, Ryan Patton, Deanna Stephen, Rick Barkman, Irene Barkman, Mike Sullivan, Gary Whitt, Linda Whitt, Paul Waggoner, Todd Trussell, Mary Kauffman and Susan Buttram.
 Steffen's selection was sent to the governor's office for the official appointment.
 This is a bad look. Not just for Reno County but for the state. If people can't get along locally at the county courthouse, how can we expect them to get along in Topeka at the Kansas Statehouse?
 We have a few questions for them.
 Why didn't you just place the rightly elected Daniel Friesen in early? It would have helped get him up to speed when he takes over in January. It could have helped with a smoother transition.
 Do you know what kind of precedent for other Kansas counties? We promise it's not a good one. Imagine if this went on in more populous Shawnee, Riley, Wyandotte, Johnson or Douglas counties. People would be furious and rightfully so.
 We wonder what the late Bob Bush would have to say about all of this? Would he approve of your actions?
 Why seat a man to the post for a little over a month and a half? What is there to gain from Mark Steffen in serving such a brief term? What amazing thing did he have to offer? The News reported no one offered comment but instead called for the vote on closing nominations.
 In our view, these Republicans did bad by their party and frankly by Friesen.
 In short, we know you can do better and we hope you will given the chance.

The White House coronavirus task force held its first post-election meeting Monday. Officials discussed the rising case numbers, the promise of a vaccine in development by Pfizer, and recognized the service of Navy Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, a member of the task force who retired Monday.
 But Trump, who does not take part in the task force meetings, remains preoccupied with last week's election results. He has yet to weigh in on the recent spike in virus cases that has state and local officials scrambling, and hospitals concerned about their ability to treat those stricken.
 With more than 100,000 new confirmed U.S. cases reported daily for more than a week, Trump has been more focused on tracking the rollout of a vaccine, which won't be widely available for months. He has fumed that Pfizer intentionally withheld an announcement about progress on its vaccine trial until after Election Day, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly comment. Pfizer said it did not purposely withhold trial results.
 Though the president has consistently played down the pandemic, which has killed more than 240,000 Americans and infected more than 10 million people in the U.S., public health experts expressed worry about Trump's silence on the troubling spike in cases, as well as his refusal to begin coordination on virus issues with Biden's transition team.
 "It's a big problem," said Dr. Abraar Karan, a global health specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. "The transition is not going to happen until January and we are in a complete crisis right now. We already know where this is headed. ... It's not good enough to say we're going to wait until the next president to address this."
 The president's silence comes as as numerous White House and campaign officials have tested positive for the virus in recent days.
 White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tested positive last week after attending an election night party at the White House. Others at the party also have tested positive, including White House political director Brian Jack, former White House aide Healy Baumgardner, and Trump campaign advisers David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski said Thursday he believes he contracted the virus in Philadelphia while assisting the president's election challenge there.
 Meanwhile, state and local officials around the country are scrambling in the midst of mounting caseloads. While Trump stays silent, they are urging their residents to step up mask-wearing and social distancing, as they brace for what many epidemiologists worry is the beginning of tumultuous period.
 In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has issued an order starting Friday for bars, restaurants, and gyms to be closed by 10 p.m., and has set a cap of 10 people for private gatherings. In Illinois, public health officials asked employers to allow their personnel to work from home when possible and urged residents to stay at home as much as possible and skip non-essential travel.
 In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who resisted coronavirus restrictions, announced earlier this week that masks will now be required at indoor events of more than 25 people, and she banned outside events of 100 or more people unless all attendees wear masks.
 Trump hasn't answered questions since before Election Day. That hasn't slowed his Twitter habit, but he's used it almost exclusively in recent days to rage over the election results and spread unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.
 By late Thursday afternoon, Trump had tweeted or retweeted more than three dozen times that day. Just one was related to the virus — a retweet of a posting by Sen. David Perdue about Georgia receiving 2,000 vials of a new antibody treatment.
 White House officials declined to comment Thursday on when Trump last engaged with members of the coronavirus task force but insisted he remains focused on the pandemic
 "The president is regularly briefed about the coronavirus," said White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews. "The relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions, and then he moves forward in the way that's best for our country."
 In the closing days of the campaign, Trump sought to reassure Americans that the country was "rounding the corner" on the virus and he wrongly predicted that Democrats' focus on the disease would go away right after the election. The president pushed a sunny public tone even after he tested positive for the virus in early October and was hospitalized for three days after contracting the virus. His wife, Melania, and teenage son, Barron, also contracted the virus.
 Biden, for his part, largely framed the election as a referendum on Trump's handling of the pandemic. He has made addressing the virus his top priority as he moves forward with his transition. He spoke by phone Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about the intensifying pandemic and prospects for passage of a COVID-19 relief bill in the lame duck session of Congress.
 Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris met virtually with his new coronavirus advisers this week, and Biden delivered remarks warning Americans that ''the challenge before us right now is still immense and growing."
 "We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives, American lives," Biden said in a speech this week. "Please, I implore you, wear a mask."
 Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University's law school, said Biden will only be able to "scratch the surface" of tackling a pandemic that could be a "raging forest fire" by the time he takes office on Jan. 20.
 He added that even the good news on Pfizer's development of a vaccine that showed 90% efficacy in early trial results could be diminished if Trump doesn't begin coordination efforts with Biden's team on how to roll out the vaccine. Some public health experts believe the task of persuading Americans to take the vaccine and widely distributing it could be as complicated as the vaccine's development.
 "I fear the next three months ahead could be the worst we've faced during the pandemic," Gostin said. "America is like a ship at storm and the captain has decided to go play golf."

National security and intelligence experts hope Trump changes his mind, citing the need for an incoming president to be fully prepared to confront any national security issues on Day One.
 "Our adversaries aren't waiting for the transition to take place," says former Michigan Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. "Joe Biden should receive the President's Daily Brief starting today. He needs to know what the latest threats are and begin to plan accordingly. This isn't about politics. This is about national security."
 U.S. adversaries can take advantage of the country during an American presidential transition and key foreign issues will be bearing down on Biden the moment he steps into the Oval Office in January.
 For example, unless Trump extends or negotiates a new nuclear arms accord with Russia before Inauguration Day, Biden will have only 16 days to act before the expiration of the last remaining treaty reining in the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Perhaps U.S. spies have picked up tidbits about the Russians' red lines in the negotiations or about weapons it really wants to keep out of the treaty.
 That's the type of information that might be in the daily summary of high- level, classified information and analysis on national security issues that's been offered to presidents since 1946. It is coordinated and delivered by the Office of the National Intelligence Director with input from the CIA and other agencies. It is tailored for each president, depending on whether the president prefers oral or written briefs or both, short summaries or long reports on paper or electronically.
 Having access to it also could help Biden craft a possible response to North Korea, which has a history of firing off missiles or conducting nuclear tests shortly before or after a new president takes office.
 Biden, a former vice president, has decades of experience in foreign affairs and national security. But he probably has not been privy to the latest details about how Iran is back to enriching uranium or the active cyber attack operations of Russia, China and Iran. China's crackdown on Hong Kong is heating up. The threat from Islamic extremists, although curbed, still remains.
 Biden is trying to play down the significance of the delay in getting access to the PDB.
 "Obviously the PDB would be useful but, it's not necessary. I'm not the sitting president now," Biden said Tuesday. He didn't answer a question about whether he'd tried to reach out to Trump himself on this or any other issue, saying only, "Mr. President, I look forward to speaking with you."
 He was also asked about needing access to classified information as soon as possible if Trump doesn't concede the race.
 "Look, access to classified information is useful. But I'm not in a position to make any decisions on those issues anyway," Biden said. "As I said, one president at a time. He will be president until Jan. 20. It would be nice to have it, but it's not critical."
 Biden is familiar with the PDB, having read it during his eight years as vice president. But threats are ever-changing and as Inauguration Day nears, his need for Trump to let him get eyes on the intelligence brief will become more critical.
 Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., predicted that the issue of whether Biden will get access to the intelligence brief will be resolved soon.
 "I've already started engaging in this area. ... And if that's not occurring by Friday, I will step in and push and say this needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task," Lankford told KRMG in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Wednesday.
 He said Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also should be getting the briefings, which should not be a problem because she already has security clearances as a member of the Senate intelligence committee.
 While the Bush team had access to the intelligence brief in 2000, an election recount delayed the Bush team's access to government agencies and resources for more than five weeks. Biden is missing out on all counts: More than a week into his transition, Biden doesn't have access to the PDB, the agencies or government resources to help him get ready to take charge.
 "President-elect Joe Biden and his transition team should not suffer a similar delay," John Podesta, who served as White House chief of staff under Clinton, and Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card wrote this week in The Washington Post.
 "We have since learned the serious costs of a delayed transition," they wrote. "Less than eight months after Bush's inauguration, two planes flew into the World Trade Center, killing nearly 3,000 Americans."
 The 9/11 Commission Report on the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks warns of the danger in slow-walking presidential transition work in general, not just the intelligence piece. The Bush administration didn't have its deputy Cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001 and critical subcabinet positions were not confirmed until that summer — if then, the report said.
 For now, the office of National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe says it can't begin talking with the Biden transition team until a federal agency starts the process of transition, which the Trump administration is delaying.
 The office, which oversees more than a dozen U.S. intelligence agencies, said it must follow the Presidential Transition Act, which requires the General Services Administration to first ascertain the winner of the election, which Trump is contesting. GSA administrator Emily Murphy, who was appointed by Trump, has not yet officially designated Biden as the president-elect.
 Intelligence agencies have given generalized intelligence briefings — minus information on covert operations and sources and methods — for presidential nominees since 1952. President Harry S. Truman authorized them for both parties' candidates because he was upset about not learning about the U.S. effort to develop an atomic bomb until 12 days into his presidency.
 "It's an important and meaningful tradition, and I'm concerned that it's not being continued," said Denis McDonough, a former White House chief of staff during the Obama administration who is now a public policy professor at the University of Notre Dame.
 Biden started receiving these more general security briefings after he became the Democratic presidential nominee, but it's unclear whether he is still getting those. A spokesman for Biden's transition team declined to comment.

 How much would it cost? How much would it reimburse medical providers? Would all doctors and hospitals be required to accept it, or could they reject public-option patients just as some now refuse to see Medicaid patients?
 Presumably, the aim of a public option would not just be to provide greater access to coverage but also to pressure private insurers to offer more competitive rates.
 If a public-option plan is required to merely break even, rather than turn a profit, it theoretically could undercut the pricing of private plans and force them to introduce lower premiums, deductibles and copays.

Veteran Chicago White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu has been named American League Most Valuable Player for 2020. It's Abreu's first MVP award, and he becomes the first White Sox player to win the award since Frank Thomas in 1994. At 33, Abreu becomes the oldest AL MVP since 38-year-old Dennis Eckersley won the honor in 1992.
 Abreu in 2020 played in all 60 regular season games and over that span authored a slash line of .317/.370/.617 (166 OPS+) with 19 home runs and an AL-leading 76 hits. Abreu also led the majors with 148 total bases and reached base in all but five of Chicago's games. Abreu during the 2020 season also had an OPS of 1.083 with runners in scoring position and a mark of 1.120 in "late and close" game situations. On top of all that, Abreu also put up the best advanced defensive numbers of his career. Abreu continued to earn praise for his on-field leadership and steadying influence in the clubhouse.
 Abreu paced a White Sox offense that ranked second in the AL in runs scored. In related matters, the White Sox won at a .583 clip during the regular season and made the playoffs for the first time since 2008.
 Abreu showed signs of decline in recent years, and the Sox's decision to sign him to a three-year, $50 million extension prior to the 2020 season was met with mixed reviews. Suffice it to say, though, Abreu justified their faith and then some with what turned out to be a career year on a rate basis.

Prosecutors matched every one of Timothy Shea’s arguments to move the trial with a reason why it should remain in New York. The prosecutors wrote in a submission in Manhattan federal court that moving Shea’s trial would put a costly burden on the government and the courts and inconvenience witnesses that include investors he ripped off.            Shea has pleaded not guilty, as have his three co-defendants, including Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist.            The men were charged with lying to investors to unlawfully raise over $25 million for the “We Build The Wall” campaign, a quest to help fund a wall along the nation’s southern border.            With a trial scheduled for next May, Shea’s lawyers asked a judge last week to move his trial to Colorado. They argued that Shea would have a harder time fighting the charges in a city he hasn’t visited since attending a New York Yankees game as a child.            They said a trial would also disrupt his fledgling business, Winning Energy, which he operates from his hometown of Castle Rock, Colorado. The energy drink company’s cans feature a cartoon superhero image of Trump and claim to contain “12 oz. of liberal tears.”            Prosecutors said they do not plan to call any witnesses located in Colorado, so a trial there would be a burden for their witnesses, which include agents and analysts involved in the investigation along with victims from the New York area.            They said moving the trial would also force the government to conduct two separate costly trials, one for Shea in Colorado and another for his co-defendants in New York.            Prosecutors also rejected Shea’s arguments citing the coronavirus and the fear witnesses who support him might have in traveling to New York during a pandemic.            “While the pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation, New York currently has some of the lowest COVID-19 positivity rates in the country,” they wrote.

Pfizer also boosted hopes this week, saying early data suggests its vaccine is 90% effective. But the good news came in one of the grimmest weeks of the pandemic so far. Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are surging across the U.S. — and turning up the pressure to get the vaccine effort right.            In Philadelphia, the health department is counting how many health care workers and others would be among the first in line. In Louisiana, officials are planning a remote exercise this week to play out different scenarios exploring how the process might unfold.            "If you get 10,000 doses, what are you going to do, versus 100,000 doses?" said Dr. Frank Welch, director of Louisiana's immunization program.            State and local officials are also planning for the likelihood that the first shipments will not be enough to cover everyone in high-priority groups.            Similar preparations are happening at the federal level. Welch listened in last week on a "war gaming" session by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.            For the vaccination effort to get off the ground, state officials have been readying systems to track supplies and who has been vaccinated. That information will be fed into a national network and will be critical in giving federal health officials an up-to-date picture of vaccinations around the country.            Providers such as pharmacies and doctors' offices will also need to be able to look up records, so people do not have to return to the same place for their second shot. More than one vaccine could also become available, and doses cannot be mixed and matched.            "We not only have to bring people back for a second dose, but need to make sure that we have very good records of which vaccine they received the first time," said Dr. Jinlene Chan of Maryland's health department.            States already have immunization registries, which will be used for COVID-19.            To better understand whether at-risk groups are getting vaccinated, the CDC wanted providers to report the race and ethnicity of the people they vaccinate. But pharmacies and other providers that do not always collect that information objected.            "We have to be careful not to put too many administrative burdens on providers that are already stressed," said Mitchel Rothholz of the American Pharmacists Association, an industry group.            He said providers have been told they will have the option to leave that information out.            Providers will also have to report vaccination information daily, which will be an adjustment for those that typically enter data weekly or every couple of weeks, state officials said.            To help people find doses in their area, the CDC wants to put information on a vaccine finder website, which will be updated each day with the latest inventory.            Supplying that inventory information might be a staffing strain for some providers, including a hospital in Utah that said it only has one person who currently enters the information, said Jon Reid, who manages the state's immunization registry.            "And they don't do it every day. They do it whenever," Reid said. State officials in Utah plan to update the inventory, rather than ask each provider to enter it, he said.

County election officials must begin the hand tally by 9 a.m. Friday and complete it by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, state officials said. The state certification deadline is Nov. 20.          Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s wife, Tricia, tested positive on Thursday, the deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, told The Associated Press. Brad Raffensperger was going to get tested and plans to self-quarantine as a precaution even if his test is negative, Fuchs said, adding that the secretary's quarantine will not affect the audit.          Raffensperger has been under fire from fellow Republicans since results tipped in Biden's favour.          U.S. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler on Monday called for his resignation, claiming he ran the election poorly but citing no specific incidents of wrongdoing. Both senators face Jan. 5 runoffs that will determine which party controls the Senate.          Raffensperger said he would not step down and defended his office's handling of the election.          U.S. Rep Doug Collins, who's leading Trump's recount team in Georgia, and state Republican Party Chairman David Shafer on Tuesday sent a letter to Raffensperger requesting that he order a hand recount of Georgia’s nearly 5 million ballots before certifying the results, among other demands.          That has led to criticism accusing Raffensperger of caving to Trump. An audit of one race is required by law but it's up to the secretary of state to choose the race. Sterling emphatically denied that the selection of the presidential race and subsequent decision to do a full hand count was the result of pressure from the president.          “Even before the Trump campaign was talking about the possibility of a recount or recanvassing, we knew that there was a specific purpose for an audit in the law. That specific purpose was to instil confidence in the outcome of that election,” Sterling said at a news conference Thursday.          The audit is a new requirement that was included in a 2019 law that also provided guidelines that the state used to purchase a new election system from Dominion Voting Systems for more than $100 million. Doing a hand count of the nearly 5 million votes cast in Georgia during the Nov. 3 election is a massive task.          “It’s a tremendously bold undertaking, to hand count every ballot cast in a presidential contest, on basically an entirely new voting system, in the middle of a pandemic. It’s not a small enterprise,” said Mark Lindeman, the interim co-director of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks voting technology and is providing technical support for Georgia’s audit.          Chris Harvey, elections director for the secretary of state's office, sought during a training call Thursday to assuage any apprehension county election officials might be feeling.

Brock Rumlow, otherwise known as Crossbones because of his armour and helmet, is the worst best Marvel villain. Readers first met him as a villain to Captain America, a mercenary, marksman, and fighter who will take on any target with complete disregard for life. After training with Taskmaster, Crossbones joined the Red Skull, the villainous Nazi. In the Red Skull's service, Crossbones completed many assassinations which also led to several run-ins with Captain America and other superheroes. Although he doesn't have any unique skills, his general capabilities and leadership qualities make him very dangerous. Crossbones carried out the assassination attempt on Captain America following the events of Civil War. He also managed a branch of the criminal organisation A.I.M., as well as the Skeleton Crew, a group of Neo-Nazis who follow Red Skull’s ideology.                      *[FT]: Financial Times

In a statement to News19, Shaw Air Force Base responded to the incident saying, "It'd be premature to identify any changes to processes or procedures at this point since the investigation report was just released. However, the Air Force is committed to preventing a similar incident from occurring in the future. The purpose of the Accident Investigation Board report is to provide us with the information we need to understand the cause of an accident, and therefore enact changes to prevent future accidents."

Hand counts are generally less reliable than machine counts, according to Larry Norden, an elections expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “Humans make mistakes,” Norden says, adding that the margin between Biden and Trump meant it was unlikely that the overall outcome would change. “It’s extremely unlikely you are going to find enough discrepancies to overcome 14,000 votes, and at the end of the day that is what matters.”

Governor Tom Wolf signed a law in 2016 that says any driver who causes serious bodily injury within a work zone could face up to $5,000 in fines and a six-month license suspension, and a driver causing a death within a work zone could face up to a $10,000 fine and one-year license suspension.            Drivers who don’t turn on their headlights in posted work zones face a $25 fine.            Additionally, in an effort to change unsafe driving behaviors in work zones, Pennsylvania’s Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement began earlier this year. The program uses vehicle-mounted systems to detect and record motorists exceeding posted work zone speed limits by 11 miles per hour or more using electronic speed timing devices. AWZSE systems can be deployed in active work zones, where workers are present, on the turnpike as well as any active work zone on a federal aid highway – this includes higher class roadways like interstates, major arterials, and numbered routes.            Registered owners will receive a warning letter for a first offense, a violation notice and $75 fine for a second offense, and a violation notice and $150 fine for third and subsequent offenses. These violations are civil penalties only; no points will be assessed to driver’s licenses.            For more information on work zone safety visit, www.PennDOT.gov/Safety.

I've said, uh, in the past back the very recent past, to be honest. Anyway, I have said that one of the possible scenarios of a Donald Trump lame duck session is him just kind of going nuclear on the government itself and starting to give out government secrets. So, you know, not anything necessarily damaging to the country, but you know, any kind of weird thing that's classified that shouldn't be classified. He could be like, you know what, go ahead and tell him, you know what, let's show him the good UFO videos, you know, what y'all want to see the big foot we got living underneath the white house that thinks pretty awesome. Come take a look, you know, just weird wacky stuff, you know? Um, but here's a scenario I didn't think of the Washington post actually pointed it out this week. And this is rather terrifying.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

“Keep in mind through all this stuff what we’re doing is relatively simple," he said. "We’re identifying votes and counting pieces of paper.”          For the audit, county election staffers will work with the paper ballots in batches, dividing them into piles for each candidate. Then they will count each pile by hand, Fuchs said. Sterling had said Wednesday that the ballots would be counted by machine.          During the training call, county election officials were shown a video with children demonstrating how it would work.          For the tally, ballots are distributed in batches to teams of two auditors. The first auditor picks up the ballot, reads the selection for the presidential race out loud and passes it to the second auditor who also reads the name out loud before putting it in a pile corresponding to that candidate, according to the video.          Some ballots are set aside to be checked by a bipartisan review panel, including those where the auditors can't agree on the voter's intent and those with write-in candidates.          Once the auditors finish sorting the ballots into piles, the first auditor picks up a ballot and counts it out loud before passing it to the second auditor who does the same as they sort the ballots for each candidate into piles of 10 for easy tallying, according to the video.          After they've counted all the votes, they record the total for each candidate and return the ballots to their box.          The process of deliberately saying the candidate name and count out loud is meant to help avoid mistakes, said Ginny Roest with VotingWorks, a nonpartisan non-profit organization that focuses on building a voting and auditing system and is helping the secretary of state's office.          Sterling said the final numbers found in the audit count will almost definitely be slightly different than the numbers previously reported by the counties but that the overall outcome should remain the same. The results will not be released piecemeal as the counties finish counting but instead will be announced once the full tally is complete, he said. The results of the new count from the audit is what will be certified.          There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden’s lead stood at 0.28 percentage points as of Thursday afternoon.          Once the results from the audit are certified, the losing campaign can request that recount, which will be done using scanners that read and tally the votes, Raffensperger said.          ___          Associated Press writer Ben Nadler in Atlanta contributed reporting.
