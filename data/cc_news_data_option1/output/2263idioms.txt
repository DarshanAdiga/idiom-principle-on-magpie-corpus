To address potential concerns, the developers have introduced a 'health reminder' notification in the game and are in the process of implementing time regulations for minor users, which will restrict their maximum playing time in a day to five hours and include a compulsory 1-hour break at the 3rd hour. An OTP-based parental consent requirement for a minor to continue playing the game after three hours of game-time is also in the works, the developer said.

"I want to start by acknowledging your feelings and expressing my empathy towards what so many of you are going through: sadness, hurt, and anger too. I want to say this especially to the Black members of our team -- I can only imagine what these days have been like. But I also know that the hurt, and violence, and injustice we're seeing and talking about have been around for a long time. Recognizing it and doing something about it is overdue," Wintour told her staff.

The Dutch Fish Marketing Board on Wednesday said that 2020's first catch of herrings — which are typically auctioned off for a good cause at a major public event — would instead be presented as a gift to the neighboring German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). The decision was to show gratitude for German assistance treating some Dutch coronavirus patients.      The roughly 4,000 salty herrings — a delicacy known as maatjes in Dutch and Matjes in German — would be handed over to NRW's Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann and the director of the university clinic in Münster, Hugo van Aken.
 NRW, bordering the Netherlands, in early April took in coronavirus patients from three EU member states, including 28 from the Netherlands, to  help overburdened intensive care units. Similar initiatives took place in other states involving other countries.
 In all, more than 100 Dutch were reportedly treated at clinics in NRW and as far afield in Mainz in the state of Rhineland Palatinate, with Munster's "International Patient" hub coordinating transfers with its counterpart in Rotterdam.
 NRW's health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann told the _Westfälische Nachrichten_ newspaper in April that it was "self-explanatory that we help." At the time, Germany had 28,000 intensive care beds ready for Covid-19 patients, 6,000 of them in NRW, of which 2,400 were not occupied, he said.
 The catch typically runs from June to August, and the start of the season is usually marked with a large gathering and public auction of the first catch, typically with the proceeds going to charity.
 Matjes are fileted herring, tail included, marinated in salty brine, with the inside flesh reddish, indicating fish enzymes yearned for taste by connoisseurs.
 Classically served, the herring portions come garnished with onions, gherkins and salad, alongside boiled potatoes and sometimes mayonnaise sauce.

The company was responding to a petition by Advocate HC Arora, a Chandigarh- based activist, who had approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking a ban on the game arguing that PUBG was as addictive as drugs, promoting violence among users and affecting them mentally. The court referred the matter to the Union ministry, before which it is currently pending.

"The time has come for us to stop turning a blind eye towards racism of past and present," Goode said in the letter. "There is no immediate resolution to racism, that of which has been deeply embedded for over 400 years into the fabric of this country. We can however, make a collective decision to simply do the right thing, now."

Reah Miller was the losing pitcher for Cranberry, surrendering eight hits while walking five and notching two strikeouts. Kayla Amsler got the Lady Berries off and running in the first inning, leading off with a walk, stealing second, going to third on a wild pitch and scoring the game’s first run on a one-out single by Carson. After Morrow reached base on an error, Kirwin singled up the middle to get Carson home for the second run of the inning. But the Lady Bulldogs escaped further damage in the inning as Bowser snagged Elista Burneisen’s fly ball in center and threw out Morrow — who tagged up at third — at the plate for an inning-ending double play.
 Back came Redbank in the bottom of the first as Ashley Stepulla and Bowser waited out walks to open the inning. But Cranberry got two big outs as Kelsey Delp lined out to first baseman Morrow and Bowser was doubled off first. After moving up to third on a steal and wild pitch, Stepulla got the Lady Bulldogs on the board as Shirey smacked an RBI line-drive single up the middle. Stealing second base, Shirey came around to tie the game at 2-2 as Magagnotti looped a single into short right field. Wanninger drilled a triple to the fence in right-center field to chase Magagnotti home as Redbank took a 3-2 lead after one inning.
 A walk to Miller, a double by Carson and Morrow was hit by a pitch to load the bases with no outs for Cranberry in the top of the third inning. A double to right-center by Kirwin knocked in Miller and Carson, but Morrow was thrown out at the base to prevent a bases-clearing two-bagger. A strikeout resulted in a run as Shirey had to throw out Burneisen at first because of not catching the pitch. Kirwin dashed home for the third run and a 5-3 lead after another strikeout ended the Berries’ inning.
 Four walks, a fielder’s choice and a single forced a pitching change for Redbank in the sixth inning as Cranberry pushed four runs home before Wiant took over in the circle for Bullers with one out. Wiant walked the first batter she faced, gave up a single to Karissa Sterling, gave up a run on an infield groundout before closing out the five-run inning on a strikeout as the Lady Berries led 10-3.
 A single by Carson in the seventh turned into another run on a groundout by Kirwin as Cranberry looked to be on Easy Street with an eight-run, 11-3 lead heading into Redbank’s final at-bats.
 Ashley McCullough started the big comeback by getting hit by a pitch and Stepulla was also hit by a pitch to give Redbank Valley a pair of runners with one out. Errors on balls hit by Bowser and Delp resulted in three runs crossing the plate for the Lady Dogs. Shirey was given an intentional pass by the Berries and Magagnotti made it hurt by doubling to the fence in straightaway center to knock in Delp and Shirey to make it an 11-8 contest.
 After Wanninger was retired on a second-to-first groundout, Cranberry was one out from sealing the win. But Bullers drew a walk, McCullough was safe on an error as Magagnotti scored to get Redbank within two runs. Troup reached first on an error by the second baseman as Amanda Smith, a pinch-runner for Bullers, scored to cut the Redbank deficit to 11-10 and the tying run McCullough was perched on third base. The sixth error by the Lady Berries in the inning on a ball hit by Stepulla got McCullough home to tie the game and now the winning run was on second base.
 Coming through in the clutch, Bowser pounded a single up the middle and Troup got under a high throw up the third-base line for the winning run in capping off the eight-run, game-winning rally.
 “We’ve been a team that’s hit all year,” Sayers said of the comeback. “At C-L, we put a big inning together. You just never know when we’ll light it up. I couldn’t be prouder, couldn’t be happier.”

Leopold hired the adventurer Henry Morton Stanley to explore the Congo River basin, signing purported treaties with local leaders along the way. Leopold then used the treaties to stake a claim to an enormous chunk of central Africa -- more or less the territory that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Belgium then as now had a parliament and government that actually ran the country, and they did not support Leopold's colonial plans, so he declared the "Congo Free State" to be his personal possession, not Belgium's, and got other countries including the United States and European powers to recognize him as its "proprietor."

Jesse Ehrenfeld, MD, MPH, immediate past chair of the American Medical Association board of trustees, said the AMA only recommends COVID-19 serology testing in three instances: studies to determine population-level seroprevalence; to evaluate individuals for convalescent plasma donation; and in concert with other clinical information by physicians as part of a "well- defined testing plan."

One of the most brutal and ambitious of the 19th century European exploiters of Africa, Leopold II was king of Belgium for more than 40 years, from 1865 to 1909. A first cousin of Queen Victoria, he ruled at a time when Europeans were colonizing -- that is, conquering -- other parts of the world. Leopold was responsible for a particularly cruel part of that conquest, during the so- called "Scramble for Africa."
