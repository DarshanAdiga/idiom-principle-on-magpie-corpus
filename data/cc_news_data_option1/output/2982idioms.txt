Return back-to-school plans in the works for Anderson School District 3


--DocBreak--
When "Big Brother All Stars" returns to CBS next week, it will do so having convinced a dozen or so returning houseguests to do what most of us going stir crazy at home can't fathom: trade one quarantine for another.
   
 Admittedly, "Big Brother," the voyeuristic summer guilty pleasure that sequesters strangers in a house to compete for $500,000 while holding onto their sanity, is one of the few TV shows that could go back into production as COVID-19 still spreads -without disrupting its now-20-year-old format too drastically.
   
 In a typical season, houseguests already don't interact with anyone but each other for up to three months, depending on how long they survive eviction.
   
 They live in a confined space, connected to the outside world only once a week as the door closes behind an evicted houseguest and the live audience is visible to the players for a few fleeting seconds.
   
 Constant surveillance from nearly 100 cameras mounted around the house also means producers can closely monitor who is doing what - and who does and does not wash their hands for the recommended 20 seconds.
   
 Strict COVID-19 protocols will almost certainly alter how the game is played this summer, most notably with conscious social distancing, rigorous temperature checks and a 14-day quarantine prior to entering the house that's already underway for the as-yet-named houseguests. Plus, could there possibly be a ban on showmances?
   
 Wisely, the network has assembled a cast of all stars from previous seasons who already know how this show works. These veterans of the dreaded eviction block will likely be easier to adapt to more stringent, sanitized (literally) gameplay because they won't have to process the culture shock of being a newbie trapped in the "Big Brother" house, a game notorious for bringing out the best and worst instincts in people.
   
 There's no doubt "Big Brother" can exist in our current COVID-19 reality. But the question is, will we want to watch it?
   
 After four-plus months spent quarantined as a nation, will it be fun to watch houseguests fight to stay in a house when all we want is to get out of our own?
   
 The addictive quality of "Big Brother," at least from this devoted viewer, has always been in the escape. The ability to dip in and out of the increasingly volatile environment of the house as the houseguests form alliances, create enemies and begin to show their true colors - all without the luxury of being able to walk away like we can as viewers.
   
 But with our lives only further constricting again as COVID-19 cases rise, watching houseguests willfully quarantined might not have the same escapist effect as we watch from the increasingly cavernous indentations made in our couches over the past few months.
   
 At the end of this season, at least one of them will have $500,000 waiting for them. But with nationwide COVID-19 charts going the wrong way, all we may have is more quarantine in our future.
   
 Conversely, this could work in favor of the game for some viewers at home, who might find themselves relating to the struggles of the houseguests more than ever now that they know what it's like to live under a stay-at-home order.
   
 Plus, what game challenge could possibly compare to living through 2020, which has brought new meaning to "Big Brother's" trademark motto - "Expect the unexpected."
   
 We're watching a lot more television these days too, meaning "Big Brother's" 24-hour live feeds and thrice-weekly episodes on CBS will only be more fuel for the bingeing fire. With all of us looking for the next thing to devour from the safety of our homes, "Big Brother" will certainly have a captive audience on screen and off.
   
 For a game known to introduce wild new twists each summer to keep things interesting (often to diminishing returns), there's a particularly stinging irony in COVID-19 - arguably the biggest twist in the game's history - being completely out of the producers' control.
   
 But that might actually make "Big Brother's" 22nd season immensely more interesting because, for the first time in years, it's a truly unpredictable social experiment again.
   
 Only this time, the uncertainty of all of this won't just weigh on the houseguests, but also those of us watching from home.
   
 "Big Brother All Stars" premieres 9-11 p.m. Aug. 5, and will air 8-9 p.m. Sundays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
