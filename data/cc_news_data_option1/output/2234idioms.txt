Yet it was just last month that residents pushed against zoning more conducive to housing development by writing to City Council with a plea to put on the fall ballot an initiative called "Protecting the Community from Pandemics by Limiting Density." That plea came as elected officials were considering putting resident-led petitions for ballot measures directly to voters, thereby waiving signature requirements for petitioners to get measures on the ballot, as the coronavirus complicated efforts to gather signatures.

North Korea said on Tuesday it will sever hotlines with South Korea as the first step toward shutting down all contact with Seoul, state news agency KCNA reported.
 For several days, North Korea has lashed out at South Korea, threatening to close an inter-Korean liaison office and other projects if the South does not stop defectors from sending leaflets and other material into the North.
 Top government officials in North Korea, including leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, and Kim Yong Chol, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, determined “that the work towards the South should thoroughly turn into the one against an enemy,” KCNA said.
 As a first step, at noon on Tuesday, North Korea will close lines of communication at an inter-Korean liaison office, and hotlines between the two militaries and presidential offices, the report said.
 On Tuesday morning, North Korean officials did not answer a routine daily call to the liaison office, nor calls on military hotlines, Yonhap news agency reported, citing the South Korean officials.
 On Monday morning, North Korea did not answer the liaison phone call for the first time since 2018, though it later answered an afternoon call.
 The decision to cut communications mark a setback in relations amid efforts to try and persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for relief on tough international sanctions. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.
 Shares of South Korea's defence firms surged after North Korea announced it would sever the hotlines.
 Analysts said the move is likely about more than the defectors, as North Korea is under increasing economic pressure as the coronavirus crisis and international sanctions take their toll.
 “North Korea is in a much more dire situation then we think,” said Choo Jae- woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University ”I think they are trying to squeeze something out of the South.”
 Cutting communications is “a well-worn play for Pyongyang,” but one that can be dangerous, Daniel Wertz, of the U.S.-based National Committee on North Korea, said on Twitter.
 “Regular communication channels are needed most during a crisis, and for that reason North Korea cuts them off to create an atmosphere of heightened risk,” he said.
 The people of North Korea have “been angered by the treacherous and cunning behavior of the South Korean authorities, with whom we still have lots of accounts to settle,” KCNA said.
 The report accused South Korean authorities of irresponsibly allowing defectors to hurt the dignity of North Korea's supreme leadership.
 “We have reached a conclusion that there is no need to sit face to face with the South Korean authorities and there is no issue to discuss with them, as they have only aroused our dismay,” KCNA said.

The US has never been a defender of democracy and human rights. The country was founded on the genocide of the native population and got rich on the back of slavery. It has had, however, one of the most brilliant PR campaigns of any country in the world. Israel tries to emulate it with many of the same catchphrases such as, “the only democracy in the Middle East.” That’s as big a lie as the US saying it stands for human rights.

Former Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) trails his Democratic opponent in the race to retain his seat, as does former _SNL_ er Al Franken, but both races are far from over.
 As of late Wednesday, Stevens trailed Mark Begich by a little over 800 votes, according to state elections officials. If that count stands, and it is a big if, it would mean the exit of one of the longest serving and, at least formerly, one of the most powerful members of the Senate. Stevens gained some measure of pop culture status after famously describing the Internet as a "series of tubes" in a somewhat disjointed description of the Internet that became a YouTube hit straight and as a mashed up music video.
 Stevens was recently convicted of failing to report on his financial disclosure forms work done on his House by an oil services company.
 His exit would also remove a swift path to the Senate for former Republican VP nominee and briefly TV sports reporter Sarah Palin. Some had speculated that if Stevens wins, the Senate would move to expel him and Palin could run for the seat in a special election–a long shot, but so was Palin’s VP candidacy.
 There will almost certainly be a recount, but the initial count still has 70,000 absentee and early ballots to tally and until Nov. 19 to do so.
 Elsewhere on the razor-thin, not-yet-decided, media-related Senate race front, former _SNL_ writer and performer and ex-progressive radio talk show host Al Franken continued to trail incumbent Repbublican Norm Coleman, but by only 206 votes according to the office of the Minnesota secretary of state. There will be a recount, since the state requires it if the margin of victory is less than one half or once percent of the votes cast, and likely a legal battle as well.
 Results in Minnesota will not be official until certified by the State Canvassing Board Nov. 18, with the recount beginning the next day.
 It is still unclear who will be ahead at that time. Vote counts often change between the first, unofficial, tallies and the final certified number.
 For example, in 2006, the difference between candidates Mark Kennedy and Amy Klobuchar changed by 2,100 votes between the early count and the final one. A tenth of that change would be enough to put Franken over the top and make the two thousand and tens the new "Al Franken decade."

To echo the sentiments of a Hill watcher who should know, it seems kind of silly that immediately on the heels of a huge Democratic victory, House Government Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) is already trying to boot John Dingell, the senior member of the entire House I believe, from his perch atop the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which he has steered fairly and with distinction lo these many years.
 That’s according to _The Washington Post_ and confirmed by the aforementioned source.
 Yes, I know, Waxman is second to Dingell in seniority, and chairing a government oversight committee when thegovernment in power is dominated by your own party is hardly the red-meat tearing, bully pulpit-providing post it has been when George W. Bush and Karl Rove and Dick Cheney were on the other end of all that inquiring and overseeing. It may be just the brass knuckles of Hill politics, but it can’t help but leave a mark when the Democrats should be trying to look their best for the victory photos.
 Waxman’s desire to move up to the high-profile chair is understandable. It would be hard to see Waxman having as much to do at oversight, and doing it would not be nearly as much fun. Being the Congress’ version of the Maytag repairman could also spur cires of unfairness from smarting Elephants with long memories about Waxman’s investigations into the Valerie Plame leak or global warming or (fill in the blank).
 The Energy part of Energy & Commerce is also said to be particularly attractive to Waxman. All that said, the move would rankle a party elder and somewhat belie Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s talk of togetherness.      Chairman Dingell is said to have already lined up members of the Black and Hispanic Caucuses, Blue Dog Democrats, legislators from Waxman’s own home state of California and others to support him. He is highly unlikely to be unseated–braodcasters are certainly hoping for a Dingell victory given Waxman’s history of media criticism. But whatever the outcome, the attempt does nothing to further the image of party unity.
 Waxman may simply be setting himself up for the day when Dingell leaves on his own accord/ If so, it gives warning to House Telecom Subcommittee Chairman Ed Markey (D-MA), another obvious candidate for the post when Dingell retires, that he will have some stiff competition if he throws his Boston Red Sox hat into the ring.

Ex- _Doctor Who_ showrunner Steven Moffat has revealed he's finished with the show following the release of his new mini-episode.
 The former head writer took to Instagram on Sunday (June 7) to announce he was stepping away from the Whoniverse once and for all, having previously planned to leave earlier.
 Moffat returned to the fray a few weeks ago to write a new _Doctor Who_ short story for Jodie Whittaker, as well as a selection of online scenes to keep fans entertained during lockdown.

Is there life after the 2008 election cycle for _Saturday Night Live?_ When the show can score a trio of winners as it did with Saturday’s first new post- election edition, yes, there is.
 The opening sketch, with Jason Sudeikis as Joe Biden, was the only big nod to political humor, and was no big deal. The past few months, _SNL_ usually hit its peak with the opener (debates, Tina Fey as Sarah Palin), so that didn’t bode well.
 The show, however, featured three absolutely hilarious, superbly performed pieces of comedy.
 First was a musical piece in which Kristen Wiig and guest host Paul Rudd (with guitar), as country artists, sang a preposterously meandering vocal about a package delivery, to the tune of “Ode to Billie Joe.” The absurdity of the lyrics, embellished with the surprisingly polished singing, made this a big winner.
 And on “Weekend Update,” an unbilled appearance by Justin Timberlake was another home run. Timberlake always has done superbly on this show, and this time pretended to apologize for dropping out of a planned appearance next week. To make up for it, he enacted a fast-forward version of what he claimed would have been the entire Thanksgiving-special edition, imitating everything from announcer Don Pardo’s introduction to sketches, musical numbers and digital shorts. It was a three-minute solo mini-masterpiece.
 And finally, Timberlake appeared again, with Rudd and musical guest Beyoncé, for a parody of a shoot of a Beyoncé music video. Rudd played the director, and Timberlake, Andy Samberg and Bobby Moynihan played Beyoncé’s backup dancers – dressed in black leotards and high heels, approximating the diva’s look as well as her dance moves.
 The studio audience never stopped laughing during the entire sketch. Timberlake, imitating Beyoncé, was priceless, and so were her reactions. Much of the rest of the show was flat, but with those three bits, _SNL_ proved there are still reasons to tune in.

_Star Wars_ may have missed the Christmas rush with Baby Yoda last year, but online stores will be fully stocked in 2020.
 By now, most fans know that Disney made the genuinely shocking choice to pass up stockings full of cash last year by keeping Baby Yoda's debut in _The Mandalorian_ a secret - and thus skipping the chance to release merchandise for Life Day.
 This year though, fans from galaxies near and far, far away will get a chance to add The Child to their festive displays. And yes, we know it's only June, but that hasn't stopped Disney from putting several Christmas-themed items up for pre-order.
 First up is the Baby Yoda nutcracker, which comes on a red base decorated with snowflakes and a nameplate proudly heralding The Child's arrival. Pre-order it now through Entertainment Earth, with international shipping available, for £39.40 ($49.99).

Si Medusa comportait des titres plus alambiqués et donc plus longs, je pense notamment au fabuleux Fearless Sky, ici, l’on retrouve un Paradise Lost plus direct et retrouvant une certaine concision concomitante avec une certaine efficacité, et c’est en cela que l’on peut poursuivre ce parallèle avec Icon. Ainsi l’album regorge de titres entêtants, dont le single Fall From Grace ou Ravenghast, l’exception à cela étant The Devil Embraced. Il faut dire qu’en dépit des années, je reste toujours aussi subjugué par le non tarissement de l’inspiration de Greg Mackintosh aussi bien pour cette collection de riffs vraiment excellents que pour tout son travail mélodique et d’harmonisation. Et bien évidemment, c’est toujours aussi excellent pour ce qui est des soli, j’ai toujours trouvé qu’il était sous estimé en tant que soliste, mais pour quelqu’un qui a « grandi » en écoutant en boucle les premiers albums du groupe, c’est toujours autant un régal que de l’écouter sur cet album. C’en devient presque beau à pleurer tellement cela touche toujours droit au cœur, et que, surtout, le groupe sait très bien ralentir le tempo quand il le faut, rappelant à tout le monde d’où il vient. C’est même très plaisant de retrouver ces riffs simples mais ô combien efficaces, renforcés sans doute par un judicieux emploi de la fameuse HM2, tant cela bave à quelques instants bien comme il faut. D’ailleurs, il est à souligner que la production de Jaime Gomez Arellano rend encore justice au groupe, avec une batterie qui sonne très naturelle mettant en avant le talent du jeunot Waltteri Väyrynen et surtout une basse qui est enfin audible, ce qui n’a pas toujours été le cas chez ce groupe.
