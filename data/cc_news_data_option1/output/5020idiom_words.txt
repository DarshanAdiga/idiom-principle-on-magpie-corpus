Wade scored 58 runs from 38 balls during IND vs AUS 2nd T20I 2020 which helped Aussie post a total of 194/5. Matthew Wade would be a wise choice as captain for IND vs AUS 3rd T20I 2020 Dream11 team to fetch 1.5x points.

Hardik Pandya is in great form and has been consistently playing well since Indian Premier League 2020 which concluded a month back. Pandya showed his excellent batting skills in IND vs AUS ODI series too, where he scored 92 runs from 76 balls in the final ODI. In the previous T20I against Australia, he made 42 runs from 22 balls which helped India cross the line with ease. He should indeed be picked as captain to fetch 2x points for your fantasy team.
