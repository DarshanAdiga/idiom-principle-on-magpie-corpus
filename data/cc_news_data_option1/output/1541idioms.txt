"Young or old, it does not make a difference," striker Lukas Podolski said on Thursday.
 "We have many young players who are outstanding and they want to become champions," said Podolski, who at 25 is among the most experienced players in the squad, having won 73 caps.
 With only three out of 23 players over the age of 30, Germany are going into the June 11-July 11 World Cup with a backbone of players from the European under-21 championship winning team in 2009.
 These include goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, Marko Marin, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil and Jerome Boateng.
 The youthful team will see Neuer, 24, often leave his goal to act as part-time defender while left-back Holger Badstuber, 21, has been ordered to turn into the occasional winger to carry the ball forward.
 Thomas Muller, 20, is equally comfortable on the wings as he is as a centre forward.
 Versatility has been key to coach Joachim Low's squad for quite some time but even more so since injuries forced five players, including captain Michael Ballack, to drop out of the squad.
 Low has also opted not to recall 33-year-old midfielder Torsten Frings and keep 36-year-old Hans-Jorg Butt, the only goalkeeper with previous World Cup experience, on the bench.
 How his young team will react on their big stage debut is still unclear, though their enthusiasm is palpable.
 "I have had a perfect preparation and am ready to help the team," said 21-year-old Marin. "I can play on either wing and I hope I get a starting spot on Sunday."
 Low himself has not tried to curb his players' exuberance though he did warn this week their time may have not yet come and the team could peak in a few years from now.
 This caution is necessarily shared by his players.
 "I am very confident," said Ozil, expected to start in midfield, in front of Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger.
 "We are a young team that is starving for success. We believe in us, have prepared well and are in top form."
 Germany next play Serbia and Ghana in Group D.

In 2019, the bonus slot for the 162nd pick was $318,200. The 311th pick — the last of the 10th round — was slotted at $142,300.
 So, some of the top college players in the country are now left to decide if they want to take a drastic pay cut to pursue their professional dreams, or go back to school and receive little financial support or, in some cases, pay their entire tuition out of pocket.
 While an extra year of eligibility will empower players to take control of their futures, it will also leave many coaches with more players than they can possibly provide playing time for. Oregon State has not yet decided how it will handle the ensuing roster crunch.

Until the NCAA provides more answers, Canham and the rest of the country's baseball coaches will be in a holding pattern. Many are hopeful that there will be a temporary increase to the 11.7 scholarships that teams are typically allocated to help deal with an unprecedented situation.
 But even with additional scholarships, the dearth of draft-eligible players who don’t go pro will create a double-edged sword for coaches — there will be an uptick of talent at the college level, but scores of talented players won’t get the playing time they need.
 “You don’t wanna carry a high number of guys and then have guys who aren’t getting reps,” Canham said. “If it’s a crowded situation, you’re not getting the work that you really want. So everybody is trying to find balance in it. But to jump the gun and start saying things and making moves before the draft happens, and before the university decides what they’re going to do with the seniors, and before the seniors decide what they’re interested in doing, you have to look at all those puzzle pieces first.”

Antes de que el rompecabezas fuera empaquetado y reenviado   a la tienda de rompecabezas en los años 60,   algo me dice una pieza se las ingenió   para quedarse en el bolsillo del chico. ¿Cómo lo sé?   Lo sé porque muchos a rompecabezas posteriores   le faltaban piezas —los agudos de Maggie Teyte*   desaparecidos al final de la guerra, el fin de la moda de los collies.   Una casa derribada; y ¿no había ocultado,   Madmemoiselle, su triste pizca de verdad también?   He pasado los últimos días, además,   saqueando Atenas para esa traducción de “Palme”.   Ni la Casa de Goethe ni la Biblioteca Nacional   parecen poder desenterrarlo. Aún así, no puedo   estar solo imaginándolo. Lo he visto. Saber   cuánto de la madurez del sol original,   felicidad de Rilke, (que amaba las palabras francesas:  _verger, mûr, parfumer_ ),   lo hizo renunciar para poder procesar su sentido subyacente.   Saber, con anterioridad, en su propia lengua   qué dolores, qué verdades monolíticas   ensombrecen, estrofa a estrofa, la simetría   del pavimento lleno de baches de la rima. Saber que el plan base   emigró, sublime y estéril, hacia donde el cálido romance   piedra por piedra se desvaneció, enfriado; los sustantivos aflautados   se estiraron, más solitarios que la vida   en letras capitales talladas como hojas en el resplandor crepuscular.   El mochuelo de la diéresis pía y ulula   arriba de la vocal abierta. Y después de la lluvia   una profunda reverberación se puebla de estrellas.

A DALBY man has been charged with five counts of possessing child exploitation material after an international operation swooped in on his home.
 The Dalby man is one of five offenders charged in Queensland on a total of 30 charges, following investigations into an illicit online marketplace where users paid for access to child abuse material.
 The five charges were from January 2020 and he is due to ‘appear’ in the Dalby Magistrates Court on May 26 for mention.
 A two-year effort by Australian law enforcement and the United States Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has resulted in 16 people in Australia being charged with 738 child exploitation offences.
 Starting in 2018, matters were regularly referred to Australian authorities by HSI following their investigations into an online web site where users paid to access child abuse material.
 The investigation involved officers from state and territory police, working together with the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE) and the Australian Federal Police’s Joint Anti Child Exploitation Teams.
 Australian police partnered with international law enforcement, including investigators from the HSI office in Phoenix, Arizona, who initiated the investigation into an illicit online marketplace where users paid for access to child abuse material.
 With the assistance of the HSI Cyber Crimes Centre, the HSI EL Paso Forensics Program, HSI International Operations, HSI Forced Child Labor Unit, INTERPOL and EUROPOL, information on registered users of the illicit marketplace was disseminated to multiple states in the United States and to international partners around the world, including Australian law enforcement.
 The ACCCE-facilitated Australian response, Operation Walwa, captures the collective effort of the AFP, state and territory police and Joint Anti Child Exploitation Teams (JACETs).
 In total, Australian investigators executed 18 search warrants and arrested 16 people on 738 charges.
 Authorities were able to remove four Australian children from further harm.
 AFP Assistant Commissioner ACCCE and Child Protection Lesa Gale said the results of Operation Walwa were a timely reminder of the risks associated with children being online.
 “This has been a long-running joint effort by law enforcement across Australia and we’re happy to see the results that can be achieved when resources are used together, particular in the current online environment,” she said.
 HSI Australia Attaché Adam Parks said the arrests came at a critical time.
 “More so than ever, children are increasingly online for their schooling, to socialise with their friends and family, and to play games,” Attaché Parks said.
 “Let this be a warning that law enforcement is undeterred by COVID-19 and remains on-duty to keep our children safe in Australia, the U.S., and online.”
 Detective Superintendent Denzil Clark from the Queensland Police Service Child Abuse and Sexual Crimes Group said strong law enforcement partnerships and a whole-of-community response are crucial to protect children from online predators.
 “Queensland Police will continue sharing our expertise and working collaboratively with our national, interstate and international counterparts to target those who pose a risk to children in our community,” he said.
 Members of the public who have any information about people involved in the possession or sharing of child exploitation material are urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
