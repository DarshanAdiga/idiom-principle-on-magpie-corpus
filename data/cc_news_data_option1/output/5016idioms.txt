Succesful strikes from Mohamed Salah, Georginio Wijnaldum, Joel Matip and a Nelson Semedo own goal wrapped up a comfortable victory…

Many people seem uninterested in forgiveness, which I also take as a sign of the times. In a deeply divided age, people have invested great energy in the creation of demons. And having conjured them into existence, we must also vanquish them, or so folks seem to think. This being true, people are especially troubled by my belief that I can forgive someone even if he does not atone or repent. Indeed, he doesn’t even have to change his ways. This strikes them as simply wrong.

 Trump's tactics are already inspiring other candidates and have been embraced by a wide array of Republicans. Supporters include congressional candidates, state lawmakers, party chairs, conservative legal groups and appointees to previously little-known state vote-certification boards.

"Dragons everywhere you look,” said Kenny Todd, NASA’s deputy space station program manager.
 With NASA’s commercial crew program officially under way, SpaceX expects to always have at least one Dragon capsule at the space station.
 SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket blasted off with the latest Dragon from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where coronavirus precautions kept staff to a minimum. The first-stage booster - making its fourth flight - landed on an ocean platform several minutes after the late-morning liftoff. It was first used back in May for the first astronaut launch by Elon Musk's company.
 The 6,400-pound (2,900-kilogram) shipment includes billions of microbes and crushed asteroid samples for a biomining study, a new medical device to provide rapid blood test results for astronauts in space, and a privately owned and operated chamber to move experiments as big as refrigerators outside the orbiting lab. Forty mice also are flying for bone and eye studies, two areas of weaknesses for astronauts during long space stays.
 Todd said all this research is "the ultimate Christmas present” for NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, a virus hunter who performed the first DNA sequencing in space a few years ago.
 As for more personal presents for the four Americans, two Russians and one Japanese on board, "I don’t like to get out in front of Santa Claus. I fear it might mess up my own Christmas,” Todd said late last week. "Let’s see what happens when they open the hatch … I’m optimistic.”
 For the astronauts' Christmas feast, the Dragon is carrying roasted turkey, cornbread dressing, cranberry sauce, shortbread cookies and tubes of icing.
 The station crew watched a live broadcast of the launch, from 250 miles (400 kilometers) up.
 This updated cargo-carrying model — as large as the SpaceX crew capsule — will dock to the orbiting lab by itself. Previous SpaceX cargo ships needed the station’s robot arm for anchoring.
 The capsule will remain at the space station for about a month as usual before undocking with experiments and old equipment, and splashing into the Atlantic. That’s another change from SpaceX’s older cargo ships, which parachuted into the Pacific. Returning closer to Cape Canaveral will save recycling time.
 This is SpaceX’s 21st station supply run for NASA since 2012. The flight was delayed a day by rough weather in the booster-recovery area offshore. This was the 68th successful booster landing by SpaceX.

Major energy producers have championed carbon capture and storage as a means to curb their emissions footprint, but the method has been slow to gain traction as key projects have been hit by technical issues and cost overruns.
 This year about 40 million tons of carbon dioxide will be captured across the world’s 21 operating facilities, according to the International Energy Agency, a fraction of total emissions of about 51 billion tons. The Australian project plans to capture 1.5 million tons a year.
 Global scientists are increasingly looking to deploy CCS technology offshore. The Northern Lights initiative, backed by the Norwegian government, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Equinor ASA and Total SE, plans to store 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year under the North Sea as soon as 2024, with long-term plans to scale up the operation to 5 million tons.
 "You’re not dealing with competition for onshore land,” said Alex Zapantis, general manager, commercial at the Global CCS Institute, a think tank which promotes the deployment of the technology. "Often there’s a lot of good geological data that’s been collected for the purpose of oil and gas exploration, that gives you an enormous head start in terms of the primary data necessary to identify the prospective areas.”
 Developing projects at sea does have a higher cost of drilling, and there’s typically a need to install new pipelines, Zapantis said.
 Another Australian project, CarbonNet, has ambitions to store as much as 5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year in the Bass Strait, off Australia’s southeast coast, and aims to be operational by 2030.
 Australia is one of the biggest per-capita emitters thanks to its booming energy export industry and the government is promoting nascent carbon capture technology, which has so far only been used onshore, as part of what it calls an innovation-based approach to lowering emissions.
 Chevron Corp.’s Gorgon LNG plant, off the coast of Western Australia, began operation of one of the world’s biggest CCS projects in 2019 after several years of delay. Santos Ltd. is working on plans to bury 1.7 million tons of carbon dioxide a year at its Moomba gas processing plant in South Australia. On Monday, the Adelaide-based company said it would collaborate with Mitsubishi Corp. on opportunities arising from the Moomba project, including the potential to offset emissions from the Barossa liquefied natural gas project.

But reports have emerged in recent weeks and days that some of them have been spotted ignoring this request when leaving airports, relying on trains and buses instead to get back home or visit nearby hotels for the two-week quarantine.
 This particularly bodes ill for Japan as it braces for the year-end holiday season, which will likely mark the mass return of Japanese nationals who wish to celebrate the arrival of the new year with their families and friends back home.
 Under the current travel restrictions, those from lower-risk countries and regions categorized as Level 2, such as South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, have been exempted from mandatory polymerase chain reaction testing protocols at airports. Travelers from regions placed at Level 3 — the second- highest under the nation’s travel advisory system — remain subject to testing upon entry, but the possibility of false negatives suggests their using public transportation is not completely safe either.
 Airport officials are now ratcheting up vigilance, reminding incoming travelers that they should arrange vehicles, such as by hiring taxis, renting cars and asking their families to come pick them up, to depart airports.
 Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture, for one, started broadcasting an announcement in four different languages — Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean — earlier this month asking arrivals from overseas to steer clear of public transportation.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With time running out, lawmakers on Sunday closed in on a proposed COVID-19 relief bill that would provide roughly $300 in extra federal weekly unemployment benefits but not another round of $1,200 in direct payments to most Americans, leaving that issue for President-elect Joe Biden to wrestle over with a new Congress next year.The $908 billion aid package to be released Monday would be attached to a larger year-end spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown this coming weekend.The cash payments were popular when they were first distributed after the pandemic hit, and Biden on Friday had expressed hope that a second wave might come after weekend negotiations.But senators involved in the talks said the checks won’t be included as part of the compromise, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others said that could cause them to oppose the measure.Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, indicated that excluding the checks while assuring small-business aid and renters’ assistance was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans who are putting firm limits on the bill’s final price tag.“The $1,200 check, it cost we believe nationally $300 billion to give you an idea,” he said. “The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn’t get anything through the Republicans, except this $900 billion level.”The plan being worked on by a group of Republican and Democratic senators is less than half of the Democrats’ push of $2.2 trillion and nearly double the $500 billion “targeted” package proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., agreed that a new round of direct checks “may be a go” at some point. “This is not a stimulus bill, it’s a relief bill,” he said. “And it’s something for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.”Both he and Durbin said that McConnell has shown interest in the bipartisan effort, and Cassidy said he was hopeful that President Donald Trump would embrace it as well.The proposal is expected to include about $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year’s end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.Still, potential sticking points remain.Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn’t support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was “immediately needed” and that additional assistance could follow later.On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and “his characterization is just not accurate” about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.“Every indication says more money is needed; we see that,” he said. “This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under.”Manchin said Biden’s team, when in power, “can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery.”Durbin spoke on ABC’s “This Week,” Cassidy appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Warner was on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Manchin was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The effort then shifted to Michigan, where Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani appeared at a four-hour legislative hearing to argue that fraud had occurred.
 "Throughout this hearing, my colleagues continued to speak in circles about ‘getting to the bottom of this.’ But we’re already at the bottom, and there’s nothing down here,” said Michigan state Rep. Darrin Camilleri, a Democrat. "Down here at the bottom of all this, it’s just a dark, empty place.”
 On Thursday, a legislative committee in Georgia received testimony from a Trump campaign attorney about purported irregularities despite a hand count and machine audit that revealed no major problems with the vote.
 Election law experts say time will tell whether Trump's approach and the support it has generated in the GOP represent a shift in how candidates handle defeat.
 "Next time could be worse,” constitutional law expert Edward B. Foley warned in an op-ed last week while offering praise for the few Republicans willing to stand up to Trump.
 Those included Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who certified his state’s election amid calls for his resignation from fellow Republicans and threats, and Aaron Van Langevelde, one of two Republicans on the Michigan board that certified that state’s results.

SPARTANBURG, S.C. (WYFF) - An Upstate church is embarking on plans to create a village dedicated to helping the homeless.First Baptist Spartanburg plans to transform land on the Northside of Spartanburg into a village of tiny homes.“Being in a safe community where you’re loved and encouraged in your journey of overcoming homelessness,” said Madison Biggerstaff, project director.The transitional housing program will be called Bridgeway Village. The focus will be on housing homeless single women“They in, our opinion, are the most easily victimized of the population on the street,” said Steve Wise, Minister of Ministries for First Spartanburg Baptist.United Way of the Piedmont said there’s a shortage of places for homeless women to stay in the Spartanburg area.“Women often are having to double up, couch surf,” Hannah Jarrett, Director of Financial Stability Strategy for United Way of the Piedmont, said. “They might even be taken advantage of in order to secure a place to live because there aren’t as many options for them.”First Baptist Spartanburg’s goal is to build 20 tiny homes. The church says each woman in the program would get their own.“Improve their lives in several different dimensions of life from spiritual, vocational, educational,” said Wise.The plan still needs approval by Spartanburg’s Design Review Board.City Councilwoman Erica Brown represents the Northside and said she already supports the project.“It’s kind of important for us to think outside the box,” Brown said. “I think this project will give us an idea and a sense of how successful it can possibly be and hopefully we’ll see more projects like this around our community.”Copyright 2020 WYFF.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s top health officials outlined an ambitious timetable Sunday for distributing the first coronavirus vaccinations to as many as 24 million people by mid-January, even as the accelerating toll of the pandemic filled more hospital beds across the United States and prompted new shutdown orders in much of California.
 After criticism from President-elect Joe Biden that the administration had “no detailed” vaccine distribution plan, Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s vaccine development program, said all residents of long-term care facilities and health workers could receive the first round of vaccinations by mid-January.
 A vaccine manufactured by Pfizer could be available by the end of the week, after anticipated approval by the Food and Drug Administration, Slaoui said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, was just as optimistic.
 “Really within days,” Azar said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Within 24 hours of FDA green lighting with authorization, we’ll ship to all of the states and territories that we work with. And within hours, they can be vaccinating.”
 But the hopeful comments were met with some skepticism as they played out against an increasingly desperate backdrop, with the virus surging across the country and packing hospitals to near capacity with critically ill patients. On Friday, more than 229,000 new cases were reported in the United States, a record, and several states hit new daily highs over the weekend. More than 101,000 COVID-19 patients are in hospitals now, double the number from just a month ago.
 Health experts said the timeline sketched out by Slaoui and Azar was uncompromising and did not account for the possibility of delay during the many steps from vaccine manufacture to distribution at state and local levels, not to mention the hesitancy that many people might feel about taking a newly approved vaccine.

“We see HTML5 and going cross-platform is one of the solutions to making social gaming more frictionless,” Jones said. “If you imagine the complicated flow, like I log into a game on Android, I download the game, and I log in through Facebook, and then I find my friends and I invite them. Then they have to install the game and then they have to connect to Facebook. That’s a lot of unnecessary friction for a lot of games to just play with your friend.”

Presented in a colourful cartoon art style that alternates between isometric navigation screens and more traditional gameplay perspectives, The Big Con is described as a "narrative adventure game with puzzles and open exploration," in which you will "meet NPCs from all walks of life, rip them off, and sometimes help them if you feel like it." In between some light pilfering, investing in the "latest collectible plushie craze," and talking your way "into deals, hearts and trouble," don&#39;t forget to "call home and argue with your mom" once in a while.

"[I]njustice is a two-way street: It’s unjust for a guilty rapist to go free, and it’s also unjust for an innocent defendant to be wrongly convicted. Our legal system must strike a balance to ensure that in our understandable ardor to convict the guilty we do not sacrifice the rights of the innocent, even- perhaps especially-when they are charged with horrible crimes such as rape."
