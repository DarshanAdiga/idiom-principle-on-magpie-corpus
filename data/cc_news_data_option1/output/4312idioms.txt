For many years, a rule of thumb in American politics was that the candidate with the sunnier outlook was likely to win. The other presidents elected in the past three decades appealed to American optimism and aspirations. Bill Clinton ran as "the man from Hope." George W. Bush presented himself as a "compassionate conservative." Barack Obama centered his campaign on "hope and change."
 Biden this month warned that "the country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life … as an occasion for total, unrelenting partisan warfare."
 After Trump repeatedly suggested that he might refuse to accept the results of the election, Biden last month expressed concern about "whether (Trump) generates some kind of response in a way that unsettles the society or causes some kind of violence."

Sun Prairie-based Shelter from the Storm Ministries (SFTSM) is now energy- efficient, thanks to the assistance of Project Home. SFTSM contacted Project Home to see how they could improve the SFTSM building and help reduce its utility bills.
 Project Home is a non-profit organization that provides weatherization, home repairs, and home rehabilitation for low-to-moderate-income residents in Dane and Green County.
 Initially, Project Home’s energy efficiency experts thought the Weatherization Assistance Program would be the best option, but SFTSM was unsure if it would be eligible for the service. Typically, the Weatherization Program assists residents who receive Energy Bill Pay Assistance and live-in owner-occupied homes or rental buildings. The unique situation with SFTSM residents is they are transitioning from homelessness and do not have energy bills that they pay directly.
 Typically, Project Home would not have identified the SFTSM building as a candidate for the Weatherization Program. Luckily, SFTSM discovered a rarely used option for Temporary Shelters, which SFTSM qualifies for because they are a non-profit.
 That option allows a full examination and scope of work under the program’s parameters and only requires a 15% contribution from the building owner (in this case, SFTSM).
 In July, Project Home performed an Energy Assessment and determined that sealing the attic air leaks and adding insulation to the attic would be essential and cost-effective energy improvements. In September, SFTSM completed the work and installed bathroom fan timers to control moisture improving each unit’s air quality.
 Project Home was happy to help make the organization’s building more energy- efficient and sustainable. Also, with lower utility bills, SFTSM will have more resources to dedicate to its mission.
 Those involved included Phillip Downs, who conducted the Energy Assessment, and Adam Weisse, who completed the final inspection. Most importantly, those involved with the installation work were Denis Bollinger, Taylor Gregorich, Dave Pressor, Aaron Koppes, and Chad Gambetti.

Unfortunately, and to compound matters, what started easily as a very non- partisan, non-religious and non-ethnic movement is being deliberately turned upside down. It would take some wisdom for the organisers to bring this progressive movement back on track. My candid opinion is that their initial strategy has achieved its first aim. Their message has resonated globally and most Nigerians at home and abroad have bought into their ideas and ideals. They must not be discouraged. The time has come for them to restrategise. Since there is nothing more to hide at this stage, they should unite and pick their own leaders and form a formidable organisation. A crusade and campaign without structures will eventually give rise to anarchy, especially if it is infiltrated by nihilists and subversives, who are up to no good, as has been the case this week. The aim at this stage should not be political. It should be how to reactivate and eventually actualise their demands. They are craftsmen and women who have created a sustainable and resilient platform. They now need to find a way of reaching out to the angry youths, the bitter destroyers, who have been going on rampage and committing acts of gross brigandage. These destructive elements have been neglected for far too long and no one should be too surprised that they are now extremely angry and giving vent to their pent-up frustrations. Our leaders and all the elites are culpable, and we must collectively accept the blames. When the wealthiest of the world live side by side with the poorest, and the rich pay no attention to the sorrow, pain and anguish of their neighbours, anything and everything can happen. The dark tomorrow has arrived on Nigerian shores, despite the good well-intentioned, nationalistic and patriotic actions of the craftsmen and women who originated the #EndSARS protests. By whatever means, next must come the magnificent, triumphant dawn.

The technology isn't rare. Amazon sells Dayton Audio exciters for $20, and companies like Solid Drive make systems for home and office use. The tech isn't new, either. Freedom Drivers hit the market in 2007, and in 2013 United States auto industry supplier Johnson Controls produced an excellent behind- the-scenes video of its Lightweight Overhead Audio System with help from studio engineer Tony Bongiovi (Jon Bon Jovi's second cousin).
 Continental first showed Ac2ated at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2018. At CES 2020, Continental announced a partnership with Sennheiser that paired Ac2ated with Sennheiser's AMBEO 3D technology. AMBEO provides algorithms that enhance the digital source signals, spreading sound throughout the vehicle with improved spatial reproduction and fidelity.
 Because the actuators live in the vehicle's structure like traditional speakers, implementing Ac2ated properly requires working with an automaker as the vehicle is being designed, a relationship like the collaboration between Rolls-Royce and its Bespoke Audio producer for the Phantom II.
 Continental says that A-pillars are generally a good place for exciters to produce high frequencies, the door panels are suitable for midrange, and the headliner and rear shelf work best for bass. However, an actuator can be placed almost anywhere, with stiffer materials working better than softer materials. "We work very early on [asking an OEM]," Drescher said, "what are you covering the surfaces in, how much air space is in that surface because you need some air space, so you're not going to pack padding around it."
 After the actuators are placed, Continental and Sennheiser fine tune the system. Ac2ated's dynamic range covers the spectrum of human hearing, from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and beyond. The system can be programmed with the same noise- cancellation features as today's systems. And audiophiles retain control of bass, treble, balance, and fader--everything they're used to controlling.
 Ac2ated's primary benefit isn't in replacing traditional sound reproduction, however. The most important advantages are saving weight and space, freeing up design, and conserving energy.
 According to Continental, a conventional high-end audio system uses between 10 and 20 speakers--even the Dodge Charger can be optioned with 19 speakers--and weighs up to 33 pounds, taking up a total volume from 0.4 to 1 cubic foot. Drescher said Ac2ated's tweeters and midrange units aren't much smaller than traditional speakers, but the bass unit is substantially smaller, and the subwoofer doesn't require an enclosure "because your car is the box." The Ac2ated system requires fewer pieces, she said, "maybe 13 as opposed to … 20 speakers" producing 12-channel audio. Compared to the traditional speaker array, a high-end Ac2ated system might weigh about two pounds and takes up 0.04 cubic feet. The weight savings help all cars but electric cars especially. That Ac2ated draws less energy and that the system is less expensive than traditional speakers doesn't hurt, either.

 Since we've all pulled up next to that car with the 22-inch subwoofer that rocks the neighborhood, we wondered: How does Ac2ated keep from vibrating a car to death? "It's not that kind of shake," Drescher said. The vibrations are barely detectable.

Joe Biden is the most cosseted presidential candidate in memory.
 He's run a minimalist campaign that's avoided the press as much as possible, while the press hasn't been braying for more access and answers, but eager to avoid anything that could be discomfiting to the campaign.
 Never before has the media been so openly fearful of asking or reporting something that might hurt a presidential candidate. Even the lowest common denominator of news -- simply being interesting -- has been tossed aside. Boring and uneventful is the new newsworthy.
 The tendency reached a new level in the media's handling of New York Post reports on emails obtained from a laptop that Hunter Biden reportedly left off at a Delaware computer repair shop.
 Here was a story with enough mysteries and plotlines to keep a couple of newsrooms busy. Are the emails, putting Hunter Biden's sleazy overseas business dealings in a more sinister light, legitimate? Did Hunter really take the laptop to the shop and forget about it? And, more importantly, what do the emails say about what Joe Biden knows or should have known about Hunter's work that depended so heavily on proximity to the vice president?
 Instead, the press has been uninterested at best and hostile at worst. It's the opposite of a feeding frenzy. The media has deployed its bomb disposal unit for fear that a potentially explosive story might detonate.
 What Biden has to say about the emails is inherently of interest. Yet, he wasn't asked about it at his recent ABC News town hall. Never mind that his response would have made headlines afterward and the clip would have been shown in every TV segment about the debate.
 Subsequently, CBS reporter Bo Erickson betrayed his profession by asking Biden his response to the Post story on a tarmac. He got slammed by Biden, "I have no response, it's another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask."
 No one rallied to Erickson's defense. Instead, respectable figures on the center-left shamed Erickson for having asked a politician an unwelcome question -- which, the day before yesterday, would have been considered Journalism 101.
 Much of the press has pronounced the Post story debunked without doing any work to debunk it and believes as a matter of faith that it is Russian disinformation. Rather, the focus has been reporting on how the Post reported the story, as the press works to discredit media outlets that don't toe the correct political line -- you know, just like Woodward and Bernstein did during Watergate.
 This tendency toward "anti-reporting" has long characterized Biden coverage. The New York Times took 19 days to cover Tara Reade's sexual assault allegation against him, not wanting to burden its readers with information about a newsworthy charge too quickly.
 Any Biden misstep is quickly explained away. The press doesn't seem to mind that the campaign is prone to declare "lids" -- or the end of the candidate's public day -- early and often.
 Usually, the media loves candidates who make good copy, who provide drama and color. In its hatred and fear of President Donald Trump, though, it has thrown in its lot with the dull and meandering Joe Biden, bringing to the effort all the complacency and pointed incuriosity it can muster.

"That skepticism can be healthy and democratic," said Stearns, the George Mason University historian. "But what we're seeing now, with a serious erosion of respect for authority, is new and different. It reflects a division that I think can bring us close to violent civil war."

 # Leaning into the storm: Reshoring manufacturing is Ohio’s call to duty
 Rick Platt
 Ohioans couldn’t get N95 masks into our hospitals. Business couldn’t buy PPE to stay open. States fought to get testing kits.
 It didn’t stop with medical supplies.
 Try to buy a bicycle during COVID? Good luck.
 Many overseas-dependent products couldn’t be found on our shelves. Some seemingly simple items couldn’t be found because of one tiny component in the supply chain wasn’t available in our country.
 Reshoring, the restoring of manufacturing supply chains to our North American shores, is imperative!
 It’s also bipartisan. It’s clearly one of only a few issues upon which both sides of the aisle can agree — let’s bring manufacturing back to the U.S.
 History shows us that issues can fade after an election though. As time passes and the early stages of the COVID nightmare fades from our memories, we must not forget the lessons learned at the beginning of this crisis. The critical need to restore manufacturing capability in our country is absolutely one of those lessons.
 The demand is there too. A recent Bank of America survey found an astonishing 75% of global corporate respondents saw the need to bring their supply chains closer to home. The Wall Street Journal recently called middle America “the new emerging market.”
 I believe Ohio is well-positioned to lead the nation in emerging stronger on the other side of this crisis by seizing upon our strengths as a state for manufacturing. We can answer the call in a crisis. It will take an all-Ohio, determined effort.
 The factors that work to grow manufacturing are here. Energy, affordability, logistics, manufacturing culture, and, most of all, a strong workforce are Ohio’s strengths at a time when those strengths are needed by the nation.
 The U.S. still produces 20% of the World’s manufactured goods. Ohio ranks third among states in manufacturing, and the sector remains the highest-paying and highest-impacting part of our Ohio economy.
 Manufacturing has kept our economy strong throughout the pandemic. Gov. Mike DeWine was right when he said to manufacturers, “You've kept our economy running in this challenging economic time."
 Reshoring of manufacturing has JobsOhio’s full attention. The non-profit economic development arm of Ohio is marketing our state as “an open and secure supply chain location.” When other states are cash-strapped and worried about their economic development capabilities being eroded by shrinking state budgets, JobsOhio is just the opposite. Investments are moving forward in the tens of millions for getting Ohio more ready to compete for advanced manufacturing job opportunities.
 All development is local though. While the state has greatly invested resources to get more sites and buildings ready to go in the marketplace and focused more resources on worker retraining for in-demand jobs, it’s going to take an exponential effort by our local communities to deliver ready-to-go sites and buildings in order to realize this opportunity. Workforce readiness is key to being competitive, too.
 Our Port Authority industrial campus in Licking County has been a model. Our manufacturers, all essential companies, stayed open and stayed safe. Defense, energy, metals, testing labs, life sciences, and food production are all critical supply chain industries. We opened two new buildings to accept more investment and funded training programs to provide a certified manufacturing workforce to meet a growing manufacturing workforce demand.
 Industry proved it can respond and be ready. Examples abound. The Ohio Manufacturing Alliance quickly formed. Nature’s One opened to make organic baby formula. Gathered Foods unveiled a protein-rich, shelf stable plant-based seafood product. IC3D printed faceshields with their fleet of 3D printers. Buckeye Mask made cotton face masks. The Ohio maker of Purell hand sanitizer, Akron-based GOJO, expanded three times.
 I’m bullish on manufacturing. Reshoring is going to happen, and it’s coming to the American Heartland.
 Let’s be ready to answer the call to boost our manufacturing capacity and permanently grow our economy.
 I’m convinced our best opportunities are ahead.
 While some may use the analogy “weather the storm” to describe their economic response, I tend to think Ohio is poised to “lean into the storm” in response to the stormy economic challenges posed by the pandemic. It will be for naught, though, if it is not an inclusive, all-Ohio effort.

The administration grounds its action in the need to rid itself of "poor performers." Certainly, there's room for reform to the cumbersome process required to remove those who fall short of standards. But this president's criteria for determining satisfactory performance begin and end with personal loyalty. The White House admitted last winter to seeking to purge from payrolls those deemed insufficiently reliable -- the "bad people," in Trump's words. The protections for career civil servants currently in place at least put some roadblocks on that path, hence this legally dubious plan to erase those protections with a touch of organizational sleight of hand. Not only will politically motivated firing become easier, but it will also be easier to hire those who meet Trump's standards: obsequiousness and, more often than not, a lack of qualifications. With no competitive process in place, leaders can appoint whom they please -- or rather, who pleases them.

So that ability to tinker and solder and to even know what a circuit is, why an on/off switch — which is basically all a transistor does is flick things on and off — why on/off switches can make logic happen. Those are very important things. So I would hope that there would be a way in the future where we wouldn't just understand the software, but we would have a better feel [for it]. ...

Redaccion deportes, 25 oct (EFE).- El domingo 25 de octubre era esperado en la 75 Vuelta a España en su sexta etapa como el dia de los dos colosos e historicos del Pirineo frances, el Aubisque y el Tourmalet en la linea de llegada. Ni uno ni otro los echo en falta el ecuatoriano Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers).
    El plan B activado por la Vuelta tras la decision de las autoridades francesas permitio a la estacion invernal aragonesa de Formigal engrandecer todavia mas su misticismo en la historia de la carrera española.
    La locomotora de Carchi supo que su momento habia llegado a unos cuatro kilometros de alcanzar la linea de meta y que debia extraer hasta el ultimo gramo de sus reservas de fuerza para asaltar el liderato del esloveno Primoz Roglic (Jumbo Visma) y vestirse la 'roja'. Lo logro.
    Saco toda su rabia para alcanzar su maximo rendimiento en vatios y conseguir unos segundos que le van a permitir soñar en rojo. En 2019, cuando muchos no lo esperaban ni veian en el a un potencial ganador del Giro, sus sueños fueron rosas y logro hacerlos realidad, entonces con la formacion española Movistar.
    Salvo el arranque en Biescas, con un dia aparentemente placido en lo meteorologico, durante buena parte del recorrido los ciclistas debieron hacer frente a la adversidad del frio y sobre todo la lluvia constante en los cien kilometros finales.
    Se sabia que esta suma de adversidades podia pasar factura a mas de uno y el primer aviso llego en el descenso del antepenultimo puerto cuando Roglic perdio unos metros de manera inexplicable aunque no tardo mucho en reintegrarse al grupo de favoritos.
    Todos trataban de esconder sus debilidades, a la vez que mostrar si podian alguna de sus fortalezas, pero cada cual asumia que habia que mover un arbol de favoritos que tenia demasiada fruta madura y que habia que hacerla caer.
    En ciclismo, la oportunidad que se presenta hoy hay que extraerle el maximo jugo posible porque solo un dia despues puede volverse en tu contra. En este 25 de octubre, Carapaz sabia que era el momento y no debia dejarlo pasar.
    El de Carchi redondeo una jornada impresionante para el todopoderoso Ineos Grenadiers, ya que a su asalto al liderato en la Vuelta, se sumo el doble triunfo de sus compañeros en Giro de Italia practicamente al mismo tiempo. El britanico Tao Geoghegan Hart haciendose en propiedad con la maglia rosa que el ecuatoriano logro la edicion anterior, y el italiano Filippo Ganna ganando la contrarreloj final en Milan.
    En una temporada que para la formacion britanica que capitanea Dave Brailsford tenia tintes mas bien negros tras su estrepitoso fracaso en el Tour de Francia, en el que en ningun momento dio la sensacion de tener opciones de renovar el triunfo logrado por el colombiano Egan Bernal en 2019 y sumar su octavo jersey amarillo en nueve ediciones, ahora parece estar reconduciendose.
    Con el Giro en el bolsillo, la Vuelta es la nueva pieza a abatir para los britanicos y el ecuatoriano ya demostro en 2019 que no es un hombre facil de doblegar. Por eso ficho por Ineos, aunque tuvo que pagar el peaje en el Tour pero la oportunidad para reivindicarse le ha llegado en la Vuelta.
    Sin ser una ascension tremendamente dura, con rampas que en un minimo tramo y muy al principio llegan al 10 por ciento, Formigal lleva camino tanto de convertirse en la bestia negra para muchos ciclistas como la abrir el camino hacia la gloria a otros.
    La estacion invernal aragonesa aparecio en la Vuelta en la vigesimo septima edicion en 1972. Era la primera vez que una etapa acababa en un puerto de primera categoria y sirvio para aupar al liderato y posterior triunfo final al asturiano Jose Manuel Fuente en la que fue su primera victoria en la carrera española.
    En 2016, en una jornada con tan solo 118 kilometros, el britanico de origen keniano Chris Froome, ahora en labores de gregario en favor de Carapaz, vio esfumarse sus opciones de victoria con un severo ataque del español Alberto Contador que termino favoreciendo y allanando el camino hacia el triunfo final al colombiano Nairo Quintana.
    Todavia queda mucha Vuelta, pero de momento Formigal ha vuelto a convertirse en protagonista de la carrera.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
 Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Give Eric Barretto credit for trying. He wanted to propose to his girlfriend while on a hot air balloon over the ocean off San Diego. But the air went out on Mr. Barretto's balloon, winds pushed them out to sea and rather than get too far out, the pilot made an emergency landing on the water. Life guards and surfers towed them to shore. Afterward, Barretto said, I don't know if we'll do that again. Of course he won't; he's with her for better or worse. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.

In a position paper put out by Beit Hakerem administration council member Danny Tauber, he claims that the towers will harm the character of the area. "The towers will dwarf the historic administration building of the Givat Ram campus, which is one of the symbols of the campus and does not speak visually of functionally to its surroundings."
