“What pleases me most of all is the unbreakable will of the Azerbaijani people because people living under fire do not move. Armenia wants to turn Tartar into Stalingrad, into the second Aghdam, Fuzuli. Why are you shelling this civilian city? Take that funeral ceremony. More than 200 shells were dropped this morning in the course of two hours. Why? What is there in Tartar? People live there. So this is Armenian fascism. They also want to intimidate us. In addition, they think that we are living in the 1990s when they attacked us, our army could not resist them and our citizens left those regions, became refugees and internally displaced persons. They have these ideas. But they should know that the present-day Azerbaijan is not what it was before. Today's Azerbaijan is a strong state capable of defending itself. Our citizens live under shelling but do not leave these places. Their houses are on fire, all property is lost, but they say “Long live the Motherland!” This makes me happy the most. And also to see our flag on the lands liberated from occupation. This is what makes me happy,” the head of state said.

You may suppose that revisiting teenage sexual experiences could be no laughing matter, however this hilarious, clever present proves in any other case. Otis (Asa Butterfield) is a teenage boy unable to spend his evenings doing what lots of teenage boys could be doing, and whereas he’s struggling to get any satisfaction, his mom Jean – performed to perfection by Gillian Anderson – couldn’t be extra relaxed about the entire thing. She’s a intercourse therapist in spite of everything, and each time she tries to speak to her son about intimacy, he turns into extra repressed about it.

Chelsea starts its group stage campaign as something of an unknown quantity. Spending nearly $300 million on transfers this summer has given manager Frank Lampard a squad swelling in domestic and foreign talent, but there's still the feeling the rookie coach doesn't know his best lineup. There are also concerns about his defense, which has already conceded three goals twice in five English Premier League games and will be without injured goalkeeper Edouard Mendy — one of the new recruits — against Sevilla. The Spanish team is a serial winner of the Europa League, including last season, but has never gone beyond the quarterfinals in the Champions League. It is coming off its first loss this season, to Granada on Saturday. Rennes hosts Krasnodar in the other game as the French and Russian clubs each make their debuts in the Champions League.

PITTSBURG -- When Dr. Sang-Heui Lee arrived at Africa University near Mutare, Zimbabwe for a sabbatical leave from Pittsburg State University in the fall of 2018, he found a surprisingly impressive library building that had been built with funding from American organizations.
   
 "It's very unusual, that kind of nice building as a library at a university in Africa," Lee said. "But, you know, when I was looking for some materials for my class that I taught, I couldn't find any good materials. The most recent I could find was from 1984."
   
 That gave Lee, who teaches in PSU's Kelce College of Business, the idea to start a book drive to collect more up-to-date books for Africa University's library. When he returned from Zimbabwe he shared that idea with Dr. Paul Grimes, the dean of the college, who liked the plan and gave Lee some tips on who he might contact to get book donations.
   
 "You never know how many lives the books will touch when they get used over there in their institution," Grimes said, "and we just think this is a great opportunity for cooperation."
   
 Dr. Lee sent out flyers, announced the book drive at the PSU Faculty Senate, and ended up collecting 18 boxes of books from various departments at the university as well as the Leonard H. Axe Library. On Monday he was preparing to ship the boxes -- which weighed a total of about 400 pounds, Lee knew from calculating shipping costs, though he didn't have an exact count of the number of books -- to Africa.
   
 "I really appreciate my colleagues in the university who really, you know, helped me by sending books," Lee said. "So this is kind of a collaborative work across the university."
   
 The cost of shipping the books to Zimbabwe is being covered by the two journals published by the Kelce College of Business, and the books are expected to arrive at Africa University by the end of the month.

The campaign against Gardner is another reason to vote for him. It consists mostly of untruth and fearmongering — the usual tactics of the left — accusing him, for example of “voting nine times to deny coverage for preexisting conditions.” This is flimflam. Gardner has voted against the unaffordable care act, yes. But said act was a failed effort to usher in single-payer health care by the back door, which, despite assurances, allowed me to keep neither my plan nor my doctor. And I’m still waiting for my promised $2,000 annually in savings. So I’ll suggest that Gardner’s 117-word bill __might be preferable on preexisting conditions to the Democrats’ 900-page word cloud of obscurity.
 On local races, Dr. Charlie Winn seems preferable to Rep. Joe Neguse, who wants to “restore faith in Congress” but seems to want to cling to his seat by mischaracterizing his opponent and the Republican Party.

The solar-orbiting asteroid, which swings by Earth every six years, could take aim at us late in the next century. NASA puts the odds of an impact at 1-in-2,700. The more scientists know about potentially menacing asteroids like Bennu, the safer Earth will be.
 When OSIRIS-REx blasted off in 2016 for its more-than-$800-million mission, scientists envisioned sandy stretches at Bennu. So the spacecraft was designed to ingest small pebbles less than an inch across.
 Scientists were stunned to find massive rocks and chunky gravel all over the place when the spacecraft arrived in 2018. Pebbles were occasionally seen shooting off the asteroid, falling back and sometimes ricocheting off again in a cosmic game of pingpong.

Of particular concern now are Halloween and Día de los Muertos. Such seasonal celebrations can typically entail interactions among numerous households, which public health officials say could worsen the spread of the virus.
 In light of the potential risks, some areas such as Beverly Hills have decided to prohibit house-to-house trick-or-treating and car-based “trunk-or-treating” this year. Neither the state nor Los Angeles County has gone that far, though both recommend against it.
 Public health officials continue to emphasize that personal responsibility — perhaps more so than any policy decision — will chart the future path of the pandemic.
 “To slow community spread of COVID-19 in our county, we must all partner together,” L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said in a statement. “Businesses and residents must do their part and adopt the infection control measures that we know to be effective. Each of us has the opportunity every single day to make the right choices for our health and the health of those around us.”
