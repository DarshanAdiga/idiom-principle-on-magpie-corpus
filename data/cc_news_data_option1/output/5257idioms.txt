After the Seymour boys fell to Elizabethton, 67-38, during the Heritage Christmas Tournament on Monday, their coach Blake Carr challenged the Eagles to adopt a soldier’s mentality.
 Like soldiers, he wants his players to weather adversity and to grow by learning from their mistakes. He didn’t think Seymour accomplished either against the Fighting Cyclones (6-2). The Eagles (0-9) committed 25 turnovers and allowed Elizabethton to finish the game on a 28-5 run.
 “I feel like the game should have been a lot closer than it was,” Carr told The Daily Times. “We kind of took a seat there during the last four minutes of the third quarter and going into the fourth. We were like, ‘Alright well, here you go.’ … I think we played soft. We made lackadaisical passes and our effort was lackadaisical. If they want to win games, they are going to have to be able to take it and want it.”
 Carr knew this season was going to be a challenge, considering Parker Aranas and Nic Childress were the only two players who entered the season with any varsity experience.
 The Eagles showcased flashes of potential during stretches of Monday’s game. Connor Hilton buried two 3-pointer in the first quarter, as Seymour only trailed, 12-10, after the first eight minutes. After trailing, 31-20, at halftime, the Eagles battled to begin the second half. Stan Pennington drilled a baseline jumper, and Hilton sank a floater in the lane a couple possessions later to slice the deficit to 39-33.
 But Seymour turnovers enabled the Cyclones to close both halves on big runs. They went on a 10-0 run in the second quarter to build a 31-17 lead before Hilton splashed a triple at the buzzer. Late in the third quarter, they went on a 9-0 run to stretch their advantage to 48-33. Their lead continued to grow from there.
 “Our problem is that when things start going wrong, we start feeling bad for ourselves,” Carr said. “It’s a mentality thing with us and being able to handle adversity. … I want them to stop looking at excuses like, ‘Oh gosh, they are faster than us. They are bigger than us — whatever it may be.’
 “I want them to play with a chip on their shoulder.”
 Carr reminded his players after the game they have a chance to bounce back and earn their first win against Maryville Christian on Tuesday.
 “They’ve got to respond,” Carr said. “That’s part of the reason I’ve been frustrated is that we are doing the same stuff over and over again and we are making the same mistakes. … But we do have a quick turnaround, so we get another shot at it tomorrow.”

On Christmas Eve, the last candle of Advent is lit. The Christ Candle. It is one of the most well attended church services of the year. At the church I attend, the 11 p.m. candlelight service is my favorite. At the closing of the service, those attending, stand and form a large circle around the sanctuary. Everyone holds a candle. The lights are dimmed, and, starting with the Christ Candle, each person lights the candle of the person next to them until every candle is lit. Silent Night is sung as the candlelight fills the sanctuary. Truly inspiring and a perfect start to Christmas Day.
 This year, there will be no service. Due to the cold weather and more inside gatherings, the COVID virus is spreading. Our health care workers and all essential workers are being stressed to the max. Elderly loved ones are dying without their loved ones beside them. Heart wrenching for all in the family.

Napier [New Zealand], December 22 (ANI): Wicket-keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan on Tuesday said that he cannot express his happiness on being named as Pakistan's skipper for the upcoming first Test against New Zealand.   Rizwan's remarks came as he played a gritty knock helping Pakistan register a four-wicket win over New Zealand in the third T20I at the McLean Park here on Tuesday. Rizwan hit a sublime 89 off just 59 balls as the visitors avoided a series whitewash.   New Zealand and Pakistan will now lock horns in the two-match Test series, beginning December 26. Williamson will be leading the Kiwis while Pakistan will be led by Rizwan in the first Test as regular skipper Babar Azam is out injured.  
 "This win is good, we lost the series, but this game was important ahead of the Tests, wanted to take some momentum going into it. Big honour for me to captain Pakistan. It's a big deal to play for the country, can't express my happiness at being captain," said Rizwan during the post-match presentation.   "The management has trusted me a lot; this was the first time I opened in internationals, I have done so in domestic cricket, but I knew I had it in me to perform and was well backed by the management. This win is for our supporters, they have backed us a lot," he added.   New Zealand had won the first two T20Is of the series, but the hosts came up short in their final T20I of 2020.   Tim Seifert was adjudged as the Player of the T20I series after the Kiwi wicket-keeper batsman registered 176 runs in the three-match series. (ANI)

This reliability, combined with Haskins’ quick trigger, turned a 20-15 loss to the Seahawks into a career day for Thomas. His 13 catches and 101 yards were both single-game highs, and he missed tying the franchise record for receptions in a game by one (Roy Helu, 14 in 2011). But the numbers overshadow the real importance of this performance, which is that it wasn’t a surprise. Thomas has been building toward this all season, improving and enduring as seemingly everyone around him shuffled in and out.
 Now Thomas is an indispensable part of the offense. He is averaging more than seven targets per game over the last seven games, and is seeing 30.4 percent of his team’s targets in the red zone, the fourth-highest rate in the NFL, according to Sport Radar. This usage has made Thomas, at least statistically, a borderline top-10 tight end leaguewide.
 This means Thomas is in range of Washington’s mammoth preseason expectations. In April, coach Ron Rivera said the coaching staff saw in Thomas “glimpses” of Greg Olsen, a three-time Pro Bowl selection who played nine seasons under Rivera with the Carolina Panthers. During training camp, Rivera continued to assert the 29-year-old former quarterback was the solution at tight end. Rivera sees parallels between Thomas and running back J.D. McKissic.
 “These are guys that we brought in knowing that — at least we felt — that these are guys getting ready to take the next step,” Rivera said. “They most certainly showed it and have played like it. They really are a part of what we’re trying to do as we go forward as a football team.”
 Thomas' production is of immense value. OverTheCap.com, a salary cap analysis website, compares a player's statistical output to his contract with a metric called OTC's Valuations. Thomas is owed $3.07 million this season, but according to OTC, he has played like a tight end worth more than triple that ($9.44 million). This is slightly less than what Austin Hooper, the tight end Washington fans clamored for in free agency, will be paid this year ($10.5 million).

The Galaxy Tab A7 has a 7040mAh battery capacity with 15W fast-charging support. Tab A7 fares well if you consider it for basic work. It can be a good companion for media consumption, online classes, Zoom meetings, etc, even though it's not the best in business when it comes to productivity.

Napier [New Zealand], December 22 (ANI): After suffering a four-wicket loss in the final T20I of the three-match series against Pakistan, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson on Tuesday said that the visitors showed their class in chasing down the total of 174.   Mohammad Rizwan's grit saw Pakistan register a four-wicket win over New Zealand in the third T20I at the McLean Park here on Tuesday. Rizwan hit a sublime 89 off just 59 balls as the visitors avoided a whitewash.   "Pakistan played really well tonight. I thought our first innings total was a very good one, and life is tougher in the second innings but they showed their class. You have to play really well to chase a total like that. They had good partnerships and it was tough to break it. They executed their plans really well but I guess I am pretty happy with the performance of our guys," said Williamson during the post-match presentation.  
 "It was tough to operate with the dew and one man down, but the boys tried their best. I don't know what the injuries are just yet, but I hope they recover quickly for they are class players. But the guys showed good attitude, they stuck through it. It has been a really good T20 campaign and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the Pakistan team for coming to our shores," he added.   New Zealand had won the first two T20Is of the series, but the hosts came up short in their final T20I of 2020.   Earlier, after being asked to bat first, openers Tim Seifert and Martin Guptill gave New Zealand a flying start. The duo struck regular boundaries and formed a 40-run partnership before Haris Rauf, in the fifth over, handed Pakistan with the first breakthrough. Guptill scored 19 runs before being caught at mid-off by Shadab Khan.   In the end, the Kiwis finished with 173/7 in the allotted twenty overs as Devon Conway played a knock of 63 runs off just 45 balls.   New Zealand and Pakistan will now lock horns in the two-match Test series, beginning December 26. Williamson will be leading the Kiwis while Pakistan will be led by Mohammad Rizwan in the first Test as regular skipper Babar Azam is out injured. (ANI)

The end of the semester has finally come at Maryville High School. However, with the end of the semester comes final exams. This season of uncertainty and innovation has presented itself with challenges, but the administration at Maryville High School sought to overcome those challenges in order to help the students and teachers be able to have the most peaceful and comfortable winter vacation possible.
 At the start of the school year, students were scheduled to come to school on Monday, Dec. 14 and Tuesday, Dec. 15 in order to take final exams, but then an urgent question arose: what happens if a student or teacher is contact traced on one of those days? If this were to happen, that student or teacher would be self-quarantined for Christmas due to the 14-day quarantine policy the state of Tennessee has in place. Having to self-isolate on Christmas Day, administration decided, would be terrible. Thus, to counter this possibility, Maryville High School made the tough decision to have the students take their final exams on the original days, but digitally. In other words, every student would be taking their final exams for first and second block on Monday from home, then their final exams for third and fourth block on Tuesday, also from home. This way, teachers could still give final exams and no one would risk being contact traced.
 However, taking these final exams at home presents other issues, such as the possibility of cheating. How to deal with this potential issue was left up to the teachers to decide. Some teachers simply told their students that the tests would be open-note. Others employed the increasingly common program called Zoom. Students were to log on to the Zoom call at the specified time, turn their cameras on to where the teacher could see their entire face, and stay on the call for the duration of the exam. This way, teachers could monitor where the students’ eyes were looking at all times in hopes of preventing dishonesty.
 Now, with exams finished and the winter break upon us, it is safe to assume that many would agree that the Maryville High School administration made the right call.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic remains out for a sixth consecutive league match for Milan with a leg muscle injury, even if Pioli's side have shown they can win even without the towering presence of the 39-year-old Swede. But Pioli also has a crisis in midfield with Ismaël Bennacer out, Franck Kessie suspended, and Sandro Tonali, Ante Rebic and Simon Kjaer in doubt. "I'd like to have more options to choose from, but we'll make the best of the situation as always," said Pioli. "The squad has always done well in turning difficulties into a chance to show something different and better. But we still have a very difficult match to play, probably with few players available, but we have the right mentality and character. We'll try and do it on Wednesday against a difficult opponent. We have to grit our teeth and dig deep and then enjoy Christmas."
