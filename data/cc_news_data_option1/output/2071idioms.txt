“The reality is, this has just begun,” Newsom said. “It hasn’t ended. And while we are moving forward because of stabilization, because of the good work that’s been done by health officials all across this nation, all across the state of California, specifically, to suppress the spread of this virus, by no stretch of the imagination is this virus behind us.”

U.S. endorsement of Hong Kong’s special status has served as a seal of approval of the city’s role as a global financial center with Western-style rule of law. The new assessment is likely to diminish confidence among U.S. and other foreign businesses in Hong Kong.

We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.

Druckmann doubled down on _Part II_ as Naughty Dog’s “largest, most ambitious game” yet, saying what we’re seeing here just “scratches the surface” of how epically scaled the next single-player chapter in America’s post-apocalypse (and Sony's growing _TLOU_ franchise) will unfold. The story sounds legit, the action looks goosebump-worthy, and the scenery’s never looked better. So steer clear of the leaks and keep yourself in suspense just a little longer: At long last, _The Last of Us Part II_ is set to hit the PlayStation 4 on June 19.

The economy isn't going to bounce back quickly on its own from the coronavirus pandemic. State reopenings, premature or not, will restore a modicum of economic activity, but it won't be enough to put many local businesses in the black. If the virus comes roaring back in states that reopen, it will cause a wave of fear that will depress demand and send some places back into lockdown. Meanwhile, wary consumers are saving their money, which will depress demand. And global trade networks and supply chains will remain in shambles for some time as the pandemic reverberates around the world. Meanwhile, although the pace of unemployment claims has slowed slightly, millions of Americans continue to lose their jobs.

The decision to hold the event was taken after the Food Action Group was forced to postpone its annual Incredible Edibles Plant Festival due to the pandemic. It was to have happened later this year. The festival, which has been organized for the past six years, enables TC+ to raise local awareness to fresh fruit and vegetable gardening through the use of not just seeds and plants, but also expert workshops as well as community garden planting around Cornwall City Hall and Lamoureux Park.
 Due to physical distancing restrictions, TC+ was forced to postpone its large gardening celebration, but with hundreds of seedlings already planted in early February, the organizers decided to re-imagine the annual event and find a way to share the veggie plants with the community.
 In order to do so, organizers first reached out to the Eastern Ontario Health Unit as well as the City of Cornwall. In doing so, they established plans and guidelines to ensure public and volunteer safety.
 "It was critical to have everyone on board from the start," said Bateman. "The last thing we wanted was to put people in our community at risk. We have a clear plan for safely giving away the free seedlings and seeds."
 Upon arrival at any of the locations, guests will be asked to form a line towards the tent by following the social distancing markers. In turn, the TC+ volunteer will take the seedling and seed order, retrieve them from the supply, and safely leave them for the guests to take home. All surfaces will be disinfected regularly, and volunteers will be wearing homemade masks and using hand sanitizer to lower any risks of close contact.
 "Local businesses have been very supportive, and we are really grateful to them all for letting us setup in their parking lots," said Bateman. "We couldn't do this without them!"
 More details about the event are available by visiting the TC+ website at www.transitioncornwall.com.

First off, if you’re wearing a mask, what the hell do you care if someone else is not? You’re protected. If you’re worried about your eyes, put on sunglasses. This is not difficult, y’all… Unless, of course, you’re a bossypants type who loves any excuse to tell others what to do.

The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic depression are going to require huge amounts of government spending. Government is devoting resources to halting the outbreak. It's sustaining businesses during shutdowns so that they don't have to be rebuilt from scratch. It's paying the bills for workers who've lost their jobs. It's bailing out state and local governments whose tax revenues are disappearing and can't finance budget deficits. And it's taking on much of the debt from the financial system to ensure that a banking crisis doesn't follow the pandemic.
