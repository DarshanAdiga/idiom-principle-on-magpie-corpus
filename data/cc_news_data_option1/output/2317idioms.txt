The Atlanta Police Department released video footage showing the sequence of events leading to the shooting of Rayshard Brooks in a Wendy’s parking lot on Friday night that led to a fresh wave of protests in the city. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution spliced together the video from different sources, including body and dash cam videos, as well as surveillance video from the Wendy’s that paints a pretty clear picture of what happened that night. The video begins with Officer Devin Bronsan waking Brooks up as he was asleep at the wheel of a car in the Wendy’s drive-thru lane. When Brooks finally wakes up he moves the car to a parking spot and that’s when officer Garret Rolfe, who has since been fired, arrives at the scene.

Standing outside the Boys & Girls Club of Brown County Friday afternoon, Katherine Palmer laughed when she recalled marking the one-year anniversary of her job.
   
 Palmer began working as the Boys & Girls Club of Brown County on April 1, 2019. This past April 1, with the club closed due to COVID, Palmer spent the day working alone.
   
 "I celebrated my one-year anniversary at my desk, by myself, in an empty building," Palmer said. "Nobody else was here. We had a board meeting digitally that day. We all met on Zoom. There was nobody else in the building that day."
   
 A little more than two months have passed since then, and the club reopened for summer activities this past Monday.
   
 While the club is operating differently than it would normally because of COVID restrictions, Palmer has not lost her enthusiasm for her job and the families the club serves. The staff has brought a summer camp atmosphere that includes teams, colors and team chants.
   
 Summertime attendance is limited to 40 children based on state child care center COVID guidelines, Palmer said. Visitors aren't allowed inside, and activity rooms have been reconfigured so that tables and chairs are six feet apart.
   
 "It's a little difficult because one of the most fun games that they play in the gym is tag, and with tag, you literally have to touch somebody, which is not allowed," Palmer said. "So they've done shadow tag and pool noodle tag -- anything that keeps the kids six feet apart. The staff has been creative with what they can do in all of their areas to keep the kids apart."
   
 Palmer was proud to note the club is celebrating 25 years in the community. Local artist Amanda Cores recently completed a commemorative mural in the club's game room. "The new mural encapsulates the sense of fun and belonging that is a key element to a successful club experience," Palmer said.
   
 Palmer recalled the day in early March when the club closed due to COVID.
   
 "March 9 was our last day -- that Friday of spring break, we had early release," Palmer said. "And then all the coronavirus news broke, and schools across the state started announcing closures.
   
 "We were just kind of going a week at a time following the school (announcements). "It was week, and I think they did one more week, and then they did the week of April and then they announced closures till the end of the school year."
   
 Some of the staff was comprised of Howard Payne University work-study students, and most of those students did not returned to Brownwood after spring break since schools and universities remained closed.
   
 "We did eight hours of tutoring every day, available on Zoom to our club members, so they could call in with their schoolwork," Palmer said. "We actually picked up packets from all the schools so that the staff could help them through their schoolwork.
   
 "We had staff coming in and filming video activities, so we had arts and crafts. We had some boredom buster games that you could play at home that you didn't really need special equipment for -- things like broom hockey. We had riddles that went out every day. We did something that we called get your body moving and it was an up and exercise kind of activity."
   
 As COVID restrictions increased, "our videos went from being filmed in our club to being filmed in each of our houses," Palmer said. "My videos were filmed in my back yard."
   
 As the state began reopening and restrictions were lifted, Palmer and the staff returned to the club, even though children weren't yet allowed back.
   
 "We did a lot of cleaning, maintenance, reorganizing," Palmer said.
   
 Referring to the differences forced by COVID, Palmer noted that normally, would have multiple rooms to choose from, divided by age, for activities.
   
 "This year, have to keep kids in group of 10 and they stay with their group all day," Palmer said. "So we have designed a home room system and we have three groups. We expect to have four groups next week.
   
 "All the kids are assigned a primary staff member and a homeroom, and that's where they do the majority of their activities."
   
 Noting the summer camp atmosphere, Palmer said, "At summer camp there's cabin competitions and spirit, and it's a whole culture of friendly competition."
   
 The children are divided into three teams -- Blackout, Justice League and Avengers, Palmer said.
   
 The Blackout team won the first week's spirit competition, earning themselves an ice cream party.

June 11 -- To the Editor:
   
 It's both a blessing and a curse to be able to see both sides of an argument - usually with everything, I can usually see the other person's viewpoint, but at the same time it tends to cause major internal conflict and unrest.
   
 In the last few months, I have been disheartened with how humanity is being reflected in the media and social media - in all things. I stopped watching the news about a year and a half ago. When I did turn it on here and there in the last few months, I found myself angry, because once you start to notice the media manipulating viewpoints to spark rage, you can't unsee it. I try really hard to sift through the information fed to us to try and find the reality. That has never been more challenging than recently. There seems to be an agenda with everything.
   
 In observing social media, people are so quick to jump down someone's throat for having a differing opinion or viewpoint without listening. I have made a concerted effort (more so now than ever) to pause, listen and try to see the other person's view. That's how I learn. I've seen the term or some variation of "silence is acceptance", which again I feel is someone not taking the time to sit back and try to understand why some people may be quiet right now. Maybe the silent ones are scared. Maybe the silent ones are pausing to listen. Maybe the silent ones are trying to figure it out and educate themselves before speaking about things they feel they know nothing about. Maybe the silent ones are active outside of social media platforms. The truth is, you just never know what someone else's experience has been.
   
 I had a great conversation with two friends the other day in a private, in- person setting. Their views were a bit different than mine, but we had a civil conversation where everyone was allowed to speak without interjection or without being met with vitriol. We all listened to the other person. We were all able to share ideas and resources and work to see the other person's side. Perhaps we didn't change each other's minds, but we listened to listen and understand.
   
 I can only speak for myself, but I found this one civil conversation considerably more valuable and productive than the time spent on reading any of the other hateful debates I've observed online. No one's mind is ever changed because Sally commented on Billy's post he was a selfish pig. In fact, I think it's only widening all the divides we are feeling right now.
   
 Conversations like the one I had the other day where we explored differing views in a civil and respectful manner rather than jumping down each other's throats for not seeing eye to eye gave me a little more hope.

Club chairman Darch offered former employees Weston Women’s coaches Stacie Morrissey, Mike Washington and Jamie Fisher a chance to work with the club ahead of the Ladies first-ever season in the Somerset County League.
 “I already worked well with those three,” said Darch.
 “We know each other and get on well. We are all on the same page, obviously that’s a bonus. We’re not new to each other, we’re all friends. It’ll be great to be reunited with them all again.
 “We’ve got an ethos at Banwell, the more the merrier, and what they will hopefully have is they will immerse themselves in the club. I’ve already put Stacie on the committee.
 “They will be full-on involved with everything. Mike offered to do training programmes for our youth sides, they have been a great acquisition for the club.”
 The Ladies already have 20 players lined up but are always looking for others who wish to join a new and upcoming team.
 “Anybody interested in playing, especially young players from 16 up, we would absolutely welcome them,” added Darch.
 “At a later date we will he posting training times, there will be a lot more publicity and will be more the merrier. As many as you like can come to training, it won’t be a closed shop at all.”
 And Darch, who saw daughter Desni grow up playing football, believes the women’s game should be on the same terms as the men’s game.
 “It’s about time it was an equal sport in school,” he said.
 “Girls should play football at school from the same age as the boys. I don’t believe in dividing sports into male and female, all kids should do all sports.
 “When I started Hutton Girls 10 years ago with Jenny Bird, we were the only youth side and there were no other teams to play around here. We had to play in the Bristol League. Now you’ve got Mendip, Weston, Hutton, Draycott, Burnham. It’s definitely growing.
 “I’m sure the village will embrace it and come down. We are in the process of building a new 50-seater stand and we are hoping to fill that every Sunday afternoon.
 “I’ve always been a great advocate for the ladies game and pushing this for the last few years. I’m delighted.”

Arsenal are eyeing a move to sign Fraser Forster from Southampton this summer.
 The shot-stopper has fallen out of favour with his current club, picking up just the one senior appearance for the Saints since December 2017.
 The England international left St Mary’s Stadium last summer to rejoin Celtic on a season-long loan deal, where he has played a key role in the side’s ninth consecutive title winning campaign, and his former club are believed to be keen on keeping him beyond his current loan.
 They may well find themselves challenged in their bid to keep him however, with both Chelsea and Arsenal eyeing his signature.
 The DailyMail claims that Arsenal are monitoring Forster’s progress as they look to replace Emiliano Martinez, who is looking for a move in search of regular action.
 Bernd Leno is not expected to give up his hold on the number one spot anytime soon, having thoroughly impressed despite a tough campaign under three different coaches, but Forster may well be open to playing as his deputy.
 The 32 year-old admitted that he was keen to break back into the England set- up when being interviewed back in November, and I personally wouldn’t rule that out considering the lack of form currently possessed by the other English shot-stoppers.
 “I’ve always said I want to try and get back in the England squad,” he told the BBC. “When you don’t make the squad it’s obviously disappointing but it just makes you want to work that bit harder.
 “I’ll just play as well as I can here and try to make it a tougher decision for someone else.”
 Could Forster’s England hopes deter him from joining Chelsea or Arsenal as a back-up option? Does he deserve considering for England with Pickford not having enjoyed the best campaign? Will Dean Henderson be the next goalkeeper to get the nod between the sticks for England?

Match-winner Darcy Parish says the AFL's COVID-19 enforced fly-in, fly-out system is no sweat, with Essendon embracing the extra downtime.
 Many suspected the Bombers might be thrown off from their regular pre-match routine, after sharing an early-morning flight to Sydney with arch-nemesis North Melbourne.
 Despite the 5am wake-up call and waiting around at a Harbour City hotel for hours, Essendon didn't show any signs of sluggishness at the SCG on Sunday.
 The visitors raced out of the blocks and fended off a late Swans charge to win by six points, thanks in no small part to Parish who booted the match-sealing goal with a minute left.
 "We knew it was going to be a tough fight here against Sydney," he told reporters on Sunday.
 "They always bring their hard contest-style play and we had to be at our best for sure.
 "There were patches there that we weren't quite at our best, but it was a great overall win and we fought really hard to the end."
 But the 22-year-old midfielder, who had 13 last-quarter possessions, was adamant the Bombers were unfazed by the irregular build-up.
 "It was pretty easy in my eyes and in most of the boys' eyes, we were just really excited to play footy again," Parish said.
 "The time went pretty quick throughout the day. It was new."
 It's probably little wonder time flew by with massages by the pool, a bite to eat and a leisurely stroll on the agenda.
 "We had a room booked at the hotel and the boys were going on 45-minute walks in groups of four," Parish said.
 "We had a couple of massages. We had the pool ... and a bit of lunch as well so the time did flow through pretty quick which is nice."
 In a rush to jump on the bus to Sydney airport, Parish expected the return trip to be a bit more friendly with North across the aisle after upsetting GWS to also take four points back home.
 "I saw North had a win so it'll be a much-pleasing plane ride home that's for sure," he said.

Coronavirus restrictions in Victoria will further ease in a week's time, with cinemas and theatres to reopen and more people allowed in cafes, restaurants and pubs.
 Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed as of 11:59pm on June 21, cafes, restaurants and pubs will be able to increase their capacity from 20 to 50 patrons.
 People will be able to order a drink without buying a meal but they will be served at a table, rather than the bar, and they will still need to leave their contact details.
 A density rule of four square metres per customer also remains in place, meaning some venues will be unable to host 50 people.
 The increased limit of 50 will also apply to auditoriums, cinemas, community centres, concert venues, galleries, libraries and theatres, while indoor sports centres and gyms will be able to reopen to a maximum of 20 people per space.
 Meanwhile, children will be able to compete in contact sport, while adults can begin training from July 13 and competing from July 20.
 Non-contact sport will be allowed across all age groups from June 22, as will skiing, with the season given the green light to kick off from that date.
 From July 20 electronic gaming at pubs, clubs and casinos will reopen with social distancing rules and hygiene requirements in place.
 The announcement of eased restrictions came as the state recorded nine new coronavirus cases on Sunday.
 Victoria's Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said three of the cases were returned travellers in hotel quarantine, while five were close family contacts of a GP who recently tested positive to coronavirus.
 On Saturday, authorities announced the male doctor - who had worked in three clinics in Coburg, Croydon and Lilydale - had contracted the potentially deadly virus.
 One case, meanwhile, remains under investigation.
 Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said the state's testing strategy would be tweaked to increase testing in communities where cases may be more likely or where testing numbers are relatively low.
 Almost 600,000 Victorians have been tested for coronavirus.

Western Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge is maintaining a "glass half-full" approach despite his side restarting the season with a second horror defeat for the year.
 Beveridge lamented the Bulldogs' raft of skill errors and inability to win the ball in the contest in a 39-point defeat to St Kilda at Marvel Stadium on Sunday night.
 It came on the back of a round-one thumping from Collingwood and left the Dogs as one of four sides yet to claim a win this year, despite pre-season predictions that they could be surprise premiership challengers.
 They now face a five-day turnaround before a clash with GWS on Friday night in the first meeting of the bitter rivals since the Giants smashed the Dogs in last year's elimination final.
 "I've got a really strong belief in our players and our group and what we're capable of," Beveridge said.
 "They'll look deep and reflect on what they can do better, but we can't get ourselves into a position where we're that concerned about how we're going that we can't break the shackles quickly.
 "We can't play paranoid footy, we have to have a positive outlook no matter what our situation."
 The Bulldogs had only five players from their 2016 premiership take to the field against St Kilda as Beveridge ushers in a new era.
 He said Tom Liberatore would come into contention for a recall from his latest serious knee injury, which ended his 2019 campaign a month early.
 But former captain Easton Wood is still nursing a quad injury and Lachie Hunter has three matches left to serve on his club-imposed suspension.
 "We've just got to remain glass half-full and there's some change sweeping through our side," Beveridge said.
 "Alex Keath and Josh Bruce have just joined us and we're relying on Tim (English) to continue to grow in his position as a ruckman.
 "(Aaron) Naughton is still a 20-year-old key forward and some of our younger guys like Bailey Smith will continue to grow week-to-week."
 The Bulldogs approached St Kilda about a possible reserves practice match last week, but the Saints knocked them back.
 Beveridge said a practice match would be organised with North Melbourne this week and was likely to take place at Marvel Stadium on Friday before the GWS clash.

The police department also released body camera and dash camera footage from both officers.
 More than 40 minutes elapses between the time Brosnan first knocks on Brooks' car door while he's in Wendy's drive-thru and when gunshots ring out; Rolfe arrives on scene about 16 minutes in. The shooting is audible in footage from Rolfe's dash camera and both officers' body cameras, but wasn't captured on any of the four recordings provided by police. Both body cameras fall off during the struggle that ensues when Rolfe moves to handcuff Brooks after speaking to him for about 20 minutes, although Brooks is briefly glimpsed being Tased before he's shot.
 Protesters on Saturday night set fire to the Wendy's restaurant where Brooks was fatally shot the night before and blocked traffic on a nearby highway. The fire was out by 11:30 p.m., but video from local news stations showed it again aflame around 4 a.m. Sunday. Atlanta police said 36 people were arrested at protests as of midnight.
 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the police chief's resignation at a Saturday afternoon news conference, and had called for the immediate firing of the officer who opened fire.
 "I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force," Bottoms said.
 She said it was Shields' own decision to step aside and that she would remain with the city in an undetermined role. Interim Corrections Chief Rodney Bryant will serve as interim police chief.
 The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the shooting, said the deadly confrontation started with a complaint that a man was sleeping in a car blocking the restaurant's drive-thru lane. The GBI said Brooks failed a field sobriety test and then resisted officers' attempts to arrest him.
 Rolfe is seen on body camera video administering the field sobriety test, followed by a Breathalyzer test with Brooks' permission. He moves to arrest Brooks after the Breathalyzer test; while he doesn't tell Brooks the result, the machine displays a 0.108 in video captured by Rolfe's own body camera.
 The GBI released security camera video of the shooting Saturday, which does not show Brooks' initial struggle with police. The footage shows a man running from two white police officers as he raises a hand, which is holding an object, toward an officer a few steps behind him. The officer draws his gun and fires as the man keeps running, then falls to the ground in the parking lot.
 GBI Director Vic Reynolds said Brooks had grabbed a Taser from one officer and appeared to point it at the officer as he fled. The officer fired an estimated three shots.
 L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for Brooks' family, said the officer who shot him should be charged for "an unjustified use of deadly force, which equals murder."
 "You can't have it both ways in law enforcement," Stewart said. "You can't say a Taser is a nonlethal weapon ... but when an African American grabs it and runs with it, now it's some kind of deadly, lethal weapon that calls for you to unload on somebody."

 El levantamiento general de las restricciones significa que a partir de ahora ya no será necesario acreditar una razón de peso para acceder a Alemania y que, junto con objetivos como el turismo y las visitas, será posible por ejemplo cruzar la frontera desde el país vecino para realizar compras.
 Por el contrario, en el caso de los viajeros procedentes de España, hasta el 21 de junio deberán demostrar aun que tienen un motivo para ingresar en Alemania, como por ejemplo el hecho de residir de forma habitual en el país, la necesidad de visitar a un familiar cercano o para desempeñar actividades laborales esenciales.
 “En la lucha contra el virus hemos demostrado que las personas de la UE se mantienen unidas con paciencia y confianza. Me alegro de que, manteniendo la cautela, podamos atrevernos ahora a asumir una mayor libertad”, afirmó en Twitter el ministro del Interior Horst Seehofer con motivo de la reapertura.
 El ministro informó además, en declaraciones al diario "Bild" que hasta el 11 de junio la policía alemana ha rechazado en las fronteras a un total de 196.000 individuos, impidiéndoles el acceso al país.
 La eliminación de las restricciones, que coincide con el restablecimiento generalizado de la libertad de circulación en la UE, va de la mano con la retirada de la advertencia global en contra de los viajes al extranjero por parte del Ministerio de Exteriores alemán.
 A partir del lunes, éste tiene previsto sustituir dicha advertencia por indicaciones específicas para cada país, aunque se espera que estas últimas adviertan a posibles turistas en contra de viajar por el momento a tres países de la UE: Suecia, Finlandia y España, con motivo de las respectivas restricciones a la entrada de extranjeros.

Schnack only hints at this. McGwire, who hit 70 home runs that season, and Sosa, who finished with 66, didn't just break those records -- they destroyed them. But steroid use by the players of their era rendered the records meaningless. And now fans find it impossible to regard the HR mark the same way anymore.

Daniel Wolff, an attorney representing some of the corporations, pointed to one that he said delivers heath care to Alaska Natives in the Anchorage area with the blessing of Congress and without express approval from all village governments. That circumstance is rare.
 "The sovereign tribal villages simply don't have the resources to get the job done" he said. "That's the job of ANCs, that's why ANCs were created."
 In a related case Thursday, Mehta denied a request from a tribe in Kansas to halt further distribution of the funding for tribal nations.
 The Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation sued the Treasury Department earlier this month, alleging it was shortchanged in the agency's initial distribution of funding. The tribe, whose reservation is north of Topeka, said the Treasury Department should have relied on the tribe's own enrollment data, rather than population data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 The HUD data showed the tribe had 883 citizens. The tribe argued it should have received $7.65 million dollars more based on its enrollment figure of more than 4,840.
 The Treasury Department has said it used HUD data because it would correlate with the amount of money tribal governments have spent responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Tribal data doesn't distinguish between members who live on and off reservations, the agency said.
 Mehta said he had no jurisdiction over the matter because Congress gave the Treasury secretary discretion in how to distribute the funding.
 "The CARES Act thus contains no 'statutory reference point' by which to judge the secretary's decision to use HUD's population data set, as opposed to some other," Mehta wrote.
 The judge also faulted the tribe for filing its lawsuit more than a month after the Treasury Department said it would use HUD data following a request for tribes to submit enrollment figures.
 Carol Heckman, an attorney for the Prairie Band, said the tribe doesn't use the HUD database and did not immediately understand the Treasury Department's methodology. She said reports by Harvard researchers who dug into the HUD data showed the tribe it was underrepresented.

Rep. Ilhan Omar argued Sunday for dismantling the police department and starting over, per the Hill. "You can't really reform a department that is rotten to the root, what you can do is rebuild," the Minnesota Democrat said on CNN's _State of the Union_. "And so this is our opportunity as a city to come together and have the conversation of what public safety looks like." Another needed step, protesters and city officials have said, is removing Lt. Bob Kroll, head of the police union, per NPR. "The Police Federation is a clear barrier to change," said Lisa Bender, the city council president. "And that is the crux of any short-term changes within our department that they have opposed for years." An activist leader told a rally last week: "I want you to understand that Bob Kroll did not come out of thin air. Bob Kroll was voted in by the people who are supposed to protect us."

Football coaches all over Northeast Ohio have seen their players come back to the field this month.  
 As they keep their eyes toward this season, however, a major change will befall Ohio High School Athletic Association football next fall.  
 Beginning with the 2021 season, the OHSAA will expand from eight to 12 teams in each of its playoff regions.  
 The new format will have the top four teams in each region getting a bye in the first round of the playoffs, while the first round will see seeds No. 5 vs. No 12, No. 6 vs. No. 11, No. 7 vs. No. 10 and No. 8 vs. No. 9 play each other with the lower seed hosting.  
 This will lead to a six-week playoff system instead of the five-week system the OHSAA currently uses. The expansion will increase the number of football playoff qualifiers from 224 to 336.  
 The OHSAA Board of Directors voted unanimously May 10 to accept the proposal from the Ohio High School Football Coaches Association.  
 Among local coaches, however, there's not much consensus over whether the expansion is a good or bad thing.  
 Aurora coach Bob Mihalik has the most experience with the playoffs, having led the Greenmen to the playoffs 14 of the last 15 years, including a run to the Division III state semifinals last fall.  
 As he enters his 20th season in charge at Aurora, Mihalik makes it clear he's no fan of playoff expansion.  
 "I was against it from the start," Mihalik said. "I just think football is unique where we have to earn our way into the playoffs. It's been about 30 percent of the teams who've gotten in. Now, we're watering it down.  
 "The more I think about it, we've been having a lot of trouble scheduling teams in our nonconference schedule because no one wants to lose a big nonconference game. I'm hoping this will loosen it up a bit."  
 Another element to consider is that, had Aurora played last season under the proposed system, the Greenmen would have had a bye in Week 11. As the No. 4 seed in Division III, Region 9, instead of opening vs. Steubenville, Aurora would have hosted the winner of fifth-seeded Steubenville and 12th-seeded Akron East in Week 12.  
 "I'm not real excited about that [the bye] either. I think high school kids are creatures of habit," Mihalik said. "Sometimes, you might be taking them into a different way of doing things if you're not playing in Week 11."  
 By contrast, Cuyahoga Falls head coach Shane Parker is all for the expansion. Falls earned its only state playoff berth in the 2001.  
 "Personally, I think it's a great opportunity for kids," Parker said. "We're trying to get the program back to the playoff level. I feel the more student- athletes have the opportunity to experience playoff football, the better.  
 "I think it makes goals a little bit more attainable for those who have been down and are trying to get back up. It's a good opportunity for everybody."  
 Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy coach Dan Larlham noted that he played with Walsh Jesuit in 1998 -- the final year the OHSAA allowed only four teams into the playoffs in each region.  
 "I'm old enough to remember playing in that era," Larlham said. "I think having eight teams in is awesome. It was a good numbers to have. I'm not sure about having 12. Obviously, it waters it down a little bit.  
 "Quite frankly, playoff football is awesome and you want to have as many kids have the chance to experience that."  
 Count Hudson football coach Jeff Gough among those who embrace the new system.  
 "I absolutely love it," Gough said. "I think that this is progress. Years ago, there were only four teams that made it in [a region], and before that, even less. I want every single kid in high school football to have the chance to prove themselves in the playoffs.  
 "In my opinion, it makes the regular season so exciting because now we can schedule anybody, anywhere. We can create these new rivalries and we don't have to be thinking about computer points, projections and school sizes."  
 Hudson made the Division II playoffs last season as the fifth seed in Division II, Region 5, where it lost to Massillon Perry. Under the new system, Hudson would have hosted 12th-seeded Kent Roosevelt in the first round, with the winner facing Perry.  
 Nordonia is another team that would have benefited from the new system last year. The Knights finished 10th in the Division II, Region 5 standings, missing the playoffs, but they would have qualified and faced seventh-seeded Willoughby South under the new system.  
 Despite this, Nordonia coach Jeff Fox said he "did not have a strong opinion" on the new system.  
 "I can see the advantage of it," Fox said. "Football season is so meaningful because everyone doesn't get into the playoffs. I think it's a good compromise.  
 "I think they have the right mix right now. We'll adjust. It allows teams to be willing to play a tough schedule. You can lose a game or two and still make the playoffs."  
 Stow-Munroe Falls also could have benefited from the new system, having finished ninth in the Division I, Region 1 rankings in 2019. However, Stow coach Tom Phillips is apprehensive about a larger playoff field.  
 Phillips feels expansion could lead to more injuries and lopsided scores, and it could water down the postseason.  
 "I am not a fan of the playoff expansion," Phillips said. "I think we are in an era right now that everyone needs a trophy. I was coaching when it was four [per region made the playoffs], then it is eight and now it will be 12. I am not a fan of that.  
 "... The beauty of football is that it is different than any other sport. You have got to earn a playoff spot. I think eight was plenty."  
 CVCA is coming off its first playoff win and first home playoff game in school history. Under the new system, the Royals would have had a bye in the first round as the No. 4 seed.  
 "I will say that first-round bye, I don't love that," Larlham said. "I would almost hope to keep playing. It throws a wrench into your plan, obviously.  
 "How often do you practice there? Football is such a regimented schedule. It would be an adjustment. Most teams would be able to handle it just fine, but it's extra work for sure."  
 Twinsburg coach Mike Bell also has been a coach for decades but notes his opinion on expansion has changed.  
 "I think years ago, I probably would not have been in favor of it," Bell said. "I think it's a great opportunity to get the young men a chance to play playoff football. My stance right now is the more the merrier. I hope they move in that direction."  
 That said, Bell noted the bye week could put a "snag in the whole system."  
 "When the OHSAA sent out the survey about this, that was my biggest reservation," Bell said. "I don't know that this helps at this level. Momentum is so important. I guess there's more than one way to look at it."  
 Woodridge coach Jeff Decker also noted his opinion has shifted.  
 "In the beginning I had mixed feels about it. I thought that eight was a good number," Decker said. "I thought the length of the season was good and everybody joins the playoffs at the right time. I didn't necessarily like the idea of some teams having a bye week.  
 "The more I thought about it, there's a lot of teams out there that have a good seasons. They just don't make the playoffs. I think there's enough of those teams where expanding it to 12 will ensure none of those team don't make the playoffs."  
 Tallmadge coach Mike Hay feels the 12-team system "makes the playoff goal much more attainable," but he was less positive on the concept of a bye week.  
 "I think there's positives and negatives to that," Hay said. "NFL teams find a way for it to work. It allows those five to eight [seeded] teams to have a home playoff game.  
 "I think in some regions, when you get to 12, it starts to water down a little bit. In our region, it's a good thing."  
 Walsh Jesuit coach Nick Alexander said he felt the bye week likely would hurt the biggest schools.  
 "I've been at [Lakewood] St. Edward and I've been at Mentor. In those big leagues, it may hurt them," Alexander said. "From my perspective in Region 5, I think it's awesome.  
 "I might look at that bye as an 'opportunity week.' It allows you the opportunity to get healthy. It could go either way, though. If you need the week to get healthy, it's good. If you get a team that's hot at the right time and they get a week off, it could kill momentum."

I lavori di questa indimenticabile infiorata hanno coinvolto circa 20 infioratori che hanno lavorato a turno e a porte chiuse, senza la compagnia di tutto il gruppo ne dei visitatori che normalmente si riversano nella citta per assistere all'evento.
