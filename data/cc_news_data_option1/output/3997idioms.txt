Jennifer Humphrey ST. LOUIS, MO - Jennifer Humphrey, 75, passed away unexpectedly on September 16, 2020 in St. Louis, Missouri. Jennifer was born Jennifer Gail Zimmerman on June 1, 1945 in Flat River, Missouri to Henry and Roberta Zimmerman. Jennifer attended Flat River High School and Southeast Missouri State. She was active in volunteering with non- profits and music throughout her education. That spirit continued during her adult years as she held positions with non-profits such as the National Kidney Foundation in St. Louis, the American Cancer Society in North Carolina and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in South Carolina. Jennifer's real passion and calling came later in life as a Senior Advocate. She worked tirelessly for a better life for all seniors in South Carolina through her Senior Service, Silver Haired Legislature and the National Aging in Place Council. Jennifer believed there had to be a better way to honor and care for our seniors. To that end, she fought for a better life for those who required assisted living and nursing home care. Jennifer's other passions were golf, where she was heard to say "I will whiff until I die" and her music, both in the First United Methodist Church Choir and with the Coastal Belle Singers. Jennifer first married David Griffin and to that union two sons were born; Christian Griffin of Las Vegas, Nevada and Brett Griffin of St. Charles, Missouri. She is survived by her children, their spouses, Nicole and Allison and her darling grandsons Grayson and Max. Later in her life, Jennifer met and married Richard (Dick) Humphrey and from that union inherited 3 more sons; Paul Humphrey of St. Peters, Missouri, Jim Humphrey of Nashville, Tennessee and Ron Humphrey of Oakville, Missouri. The family got even larger with the addition of five more grandchildren, Mark, Robert, Danielle, Rachel and Zachary and the addition of Great-Grandchildren Conor and Evan Humphrey. Jennifer is also survived by two sisters, Eleanor of San Leandro, California and Judy of Fredericktown, Missouri. She was preceded in death by her elder sister Lucille and her parents. Jennifer was also blessed with many nieces and nephews. Jennifer's last wish was to say good-bye in her adopted home of Charleston. In light of the current COVID pandemic, it is our hope Jennifer's service can be held next Spring to include a church service and celebration of her life. Should you wish to attend, please contact her son, Christian Griffin, via email at cngriffin68@gmail.com or by phone at (702) 806-6175. We look forward to seeing you at the celebration. If you are unable to attend or wish to honor Jennifer, please make a contribution to the American Cancer Society, ASPCA or your local elder care facility to continue her mission.

Maurice Durand Mt. Pleasant - M. Nelson Durand, of Mount Pleasant, SC, passed away on October 3, 2020 at his home, surrounded by his family. He was 92. Nelson was born on October 25, 1927, in Ridley Park, PA, the son of Maurice N. Durand and Caroline Bacon Durand. He was the loving and devoted husband and is survived by his wife of nearly 70 years, Gladys Myers Durand. He was the loving father of three children, Edward and his wife June Durand, Lynn and his wife Jane Sullivan-Durand, and Ruth and her husband Todd Hoover. He will also be fondly remembered by his nine grandchildren Nicole, Wesley, Naomi, Laura, Alex, Anya, Sasha, Nicholas, and Christopher, and by his four great- grandchildren Addy, Lilah, Austin, and Sarah. After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard in World War II, Nelson graduated from Penn State University in 1950 with a B.S. in Forestry, earned a teaching certificate from Millersville State Teachers College in 1952, and earned an M.Ed. from Penn State in 1953. After seven years as a science teacher at East Pennsboro High School, he began a long career at Milton Hershey School in Hershey, PA in 1959 as a teacher. The school serves disadvantaged youth and includes a residential component for its students, and for several years Nelson and Gladys served as houseparents for one if its student homes. Nelson was quickly promoted to Director of the Junior and Intermediate Home Life Division, and in 1965 became Director of the Intermediate Division, including both home and school operations. He served as Director of Intermediate Education from 1984 until his retirement in 1992, having helped to shape the lives of over 4,000 boys and girls in the innovative education programs that his team created (and knowing every one of those students by name). Nelson also served as the president of and a Paul Harris Fellow in the Hershey Rotary Club, and a board member of the Pennsylvania Association of Private Academic Schools, the Central Pennsylvania Blood Bank, the Dauphin County Partnership for Aging, and the Derry Township Senior Citizens Council. He has been active in his churches, First United Methodist Church in Hershey, and later Sunrise Presbyterian Church in Sullivan's Island, and devoted many hours of volunteer service to the Seafarer's Ministry at the Port of Charleston. After retirement, Nelson and Gladys lived for a few years in Hershey, then moved to Mount Pleasant, where they have resided since 2003 in the Franke at Seaside community. Nelson will be deeply missed by his family, friends and all who he influenced throughout his life, and he never faltered in maintaining his attitude to "accentuate the positive." A celebration of Nelson's life will be held at a date to be announced in the future. Instead of flowers, gifts in memoriam may be given to the Milton Hershey Alumni Association in Hershey, PA, the Charleston Port and Seafarers' Society, or Sunrise Presbyterian Church in Sullivan's Island.

Today, everything is media. For example, you can’t take your smartphone without finding out what’s happening at the moment. The news about the ongoing pandemic is all over the place. While you need to have an insight into what’s going on, there’s no reason to get involved in all the news stories being published. Social media are all fun and games until you realize there’s too many false stories circling the web. It would be best if you staved off on rumors, as they can bring you anxiety and downgrade your wellbeing. Everyone needs to know the primary issues we’re facing and what’s going on in your community, but staying far away from exaggerations is half the health. There are reliable sources out there, and you should read and listen to what the CDC and the WHO are saying.

 # President’s virus diagnosis adds new credibility to governor’s warnings
 Sherry Robinson
 All She Wrote
 View Comments
 Public and pundits have examined the president’s illness with COVID-19 from all angles. In New Mexico, it reframes the governor’s weekly messages in a frightening new way.
 We’re tired of this virus, and lots of us have taken chances. Last week, New Mexico’s numbers shot upward and kept going, leading the governor to say warning bells are ringing.
 Dr. David Scrase, secretary of the state Human Services Department, said that on Sept. 30 the spread rate was 1.27, meaning that each COVID-19-positive person would infect just over one other person. The target is 1.05 or lower. New daily cases are up. So is the seven-day rolling average. And, most worrisome, hospitalizations have increased 30% in a week.
 The big jumps are in the two largest urban counties, Bernalillo and Doña Ana, and pretty much the whole East Side.
 So far, the state Health Department has made nearly 3,000 rapid responses to reports of infected employees in businesses. (This usually involves closing the business for a day, deep cleaning, and other remedial action.) That too surged, and the biggest increases in rapid responses were Lea County, 90%; Eddy, 60%; and Curry, 50%.
 “We’re hearing about businesses all across the state where employees aren’t wearing masks, and customers aren’t required to wear masks,” Scrase said. The business sector most affected is general services – auto and appliance repair, hair and nail salons, and laundry services.
 “We all really have to buckle down,” he said, and keep doing the things proven to work – masks, social distance, hand washing, staying home. The state has the right public health orders in place, he said. Now people just need to follow them.
 Last week I wrote about testing rates. Scrase presented new numbers for testing that are far lower than those reports. The statewide average is testing of 22% of the population. Individual counties vary: Lea County, 17.6%; Eddy, 17.3%; Chaves, 23.4%; Bernalillo, 23%; Rio Arriba, 28.9%; and McKinley, 37%.
 Scrase said the drug Remdesivir is now available to all New Mexico hospitals, and there’s no shortage. He called it a New Mexico success story that we were early adopters. The antiviral drug hasn’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration but was authorized in May to treat hospitalized patients with the virus.
 At this writing, Trump was taking Remdesivir, so if you’re sick, you now have some of the same treatment available as the president. He was also given a promising but still experimental antibody drug that also reduces the virus.
 Media outlets have dissected when he was diagnosed and how many events he attended where he and others were unmasked and closely gathered, and there was a running tally of others infected. The president for months promised that the virus would just go away and refused to wear a mask in public, even chiding Joe Biden during the debate for always wearing a mask.
 Here in New Mexico, the governor and her people have walked the talk. As they warned about the virus and its dangers, they took their masks off only to speak, and they’ve had the same message week after week. That’s what health experts say should have been happening locally and nationally all along.
 Recently, the National Safety Council listed New Mexico with 11 other states as on track with its virus defense. And we were worthy of an article in Scientific American.
 In the context of the president’s illness, the governor and Scrase look less like scolds and killjoys and more like responsible public sentinels.
 So many people have sent clever hand-made masks to the governor that she must have quite a collection. When this is all over, she should donate them to a state museum because they’re emblematic of this sad episode.

MVP doesn't care if they get drafted to the blue this week, they can get a spot in the black & gold tonight. MVP walks off and Crews tells his partners not to pay attention to MVP and his usual talk.

Trump, 74, has not had a fever in more than 72 hours and his oxygen levels are normal, his medical team told reporters in front of the hospital. The doctors declined, however, to discuss any toll the disease could have on the president's lungs or disclose when Trump last tested negative for the coronavirus.
 The team added that the president had received supplemental oxygen twice in recent days.
 "He may not entirely be out of the woods yet," Dr Sean P Conley, the White House physician, said. "If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief."
 But Conley said the medical team believed Trump was ready to leave the hospital, stressing he would have world-class medical care around the clock at the White House.
 Conley said doctors were in "uncharted territory" because Trump had received certain therapies so early in the course of the illness.

She was active in volunteering with non-profits and music throughout her education. That spirit continued during her adult years as she held positions with non-profits such as the National Kidney Foundation in St. Louis, the American Cancer Society in North Carolina and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in South Carolina. Jennifer's real passion and calling came later in life as a Senior Advocate. She worked tirelessly for a better life for all seniors in South Carolina through her Senior Service, Silver Haired Legislature and the National Aging in Place Council. Jennifer believed there had to be a better way to honor and care for our seniors. To that end, she fought for a better life for those who required assisted living and nursing home care. Jennifer's other passions were golf, where she was heard to say "I will whiff until I die" and her music, both in the First United Methodist Church Choir and with the Coastal Belle Singers. Jennifer first married David Griffin and to that union two sons were born; Christian Griffin of Las Vegas, Nevada and Brett Griffin of St. Charles, Missouri. She is survived by her children, their spouses, Nicole and Allison and her darling grandsons Grayson and Max. Later in her life, Jennifer met and married Richard (Dick) Humphrey and from that union inherited 3 more sons; Paul Humphrey of St. Peters, Missouri, Jim Humphrey of Nashville, Tennessee and Ron Humphrey of Oakville, Missouri. The family got even larger with the addition of five more grandchildren, Mark, Robert, Danielle, Rachel and Zachary and the addition of Great-Grandchildren Conor and Evan Humphrey. Jennifer is also survived by two sisters, Eleanor of San Leandro, California and Judy of Fredericktown, Missouri. She was preceded in death by her elder sister Lucille and her parents. Jennifer was also blessed with many nieces and nephews. Jennifer's last wish was to say good-bye in her adopted home of Charleston. In light of the current COVID pandemic, it is our hope Jennifer's service can be held next Spring to include a church service and celebration of her life. Should you wish to attend, please contact her son, Christian Griffin, via email at cngriffin68@gmail.com or by phone at (702) 806-6175. We look forward to seeing you at the celebration. If you are unable to attend or wish to honor Jennifer, please make a contribution to the American Cancer Society, ASPCA or your local elder care facility to continue her mission.

 Reed feels the true hero was O'Beirne, "who risked his own life to get the driver out of the burning vehicle," Reed said.

“We were supposed to be with New Day and during the show which was our debut. The main event was an 8 man or a 6 man, I can’t remember, but it was 3 guys vs New Day. New Day was going over and then our music would hit and we would stand at the top of the ring to end SmackDown and that would be the first time you see us. SmackDown would go off the air with the three of us standing there. It would have been a cool moment and a cool spot to be in working with New Day but the match went long so we are standing there in gorilla position and they cut it because we wouldn’t have time to get out to the top of the ramp and then shoot us. They would have only been able to shoot a couple seconds and it would not be effective enough. The next week, for whatever reason, that plan changed and we ended up doing something with the Usos and through this cosmic event that happened, Shinske Nakamura was on a house show in California. We were there with him and he got attacked by a bomb-sniffing dog and bites him and he has to go to the hospital. The next day at SmackDown we are in California and they said someone has to wrestle Jeff Hardy for the U.S. title. I’m pretty sure it was BG James that said Eric Young is excellent, he’s a heel and he’s new so it’s a good spot for him so have him come out and challenge Jeff, so that’s what we did. Well, Eric can’t beat Jeff. We don’t know who Eric is yet. We know Sanity is brand new and then it’s like maybe the Usos can come out and we can attack Jeff. So, it goes into a 6 man. They can’t go over because the Usos are going for the tag titles and Jeff has the U.S. title so the first time seeing us work on TV, we get beat and immediately I knew we were done and dead in the water.”

Restaurants in San Diego have had to take a crash course in survival during this pandemic and outside dining has become an absolute must for our eateries. During the first shutdown, many restaurants adapted by offering to-go options or curbside service for its customers. But that only accounted for a small percentage off their original sales and that meant only being able to keep a small percentage of the staff working. That shutdown was lifted and restaurants began to bounce back from the edge of failure. Then, the State of California slammed a second shutdown on the industry and it was back to square one all over again.

Además, Tabárez aprovechó para opinar sobre el primer partido de Suárez en el conjunto colchonero y resaltó que este "superó lo que se podía esperar de un jugador que debuta". Además, recalcó el "buen relacionamiento" que mostró el '9' con sus nuevos compañeros.
 Hasta el momento, el goleador jugó tres encuentros en la escuadra conducida por Diego Simeone y anotó dos tantos.
 Por otro lado, el entrenador uruguayo habló sobre la "experiencia" y la "madurez" adquirida por el atacante en el último tiempo tanto en lo profesional como en lo personal.
 "Es un jugador que ya está emparentado con las buenas decisiones y con ser valiente en cuanto a tomarlas", puntualizó.
 Además, Tabárez destacó, una vez más, a Simeone, quien para él es "un gran entrenador".
 A partir de esta temporada, el argentino, que ya contaba con Giménez en su plantilla, también tendrá a Suárez y a Torreira, quien cerró su traspaso desde el Arsenal inglés este lunes.
 Durante la rueda de prensa, Tabárez se refirió al presente de Fede Valverde, quien ya suma un gol en el Real Madrid esta temporada.
 "A veces decimos que bajó su nivel y no nos damos cuenta de lo grueso, que es haber llegado ahí y ocupar esa posición. Y puede pasar por oscilaciones como cualquier persona en cualquier profesión", apostilló Tabárez.

A long line stretched out the principal’s office and down the hall that morning, catching the suspicious eye of Don Stover, the Stonewall basketball coach. Stover may have suspected that Logan fans, seemingly always in pursuit of a tournament tickets, might try to infiltrate enemy territory and gobble up tickets that might otherwise go to loyal Stonewall rooters.
 And sure enough, he surveyed the line and spotted Logan folks. We can only speculate whether they were brazen enough to wear their Logan jackets in the Stonewall corridors on that chilly morning.
 Stover then hurried over to the Stonewall employees handling the ticket sales and said, “Wait a minute! We’re selling tickets to Logan fans.’’ Whereupon, all subsequent sales had to be accompanied by proper identification. Anyone with a Logan address was summarily rejected.
 All these years later, Larry “Speedy’’ Bevins still remembers that many Logan fans returned home empty-handed that day. “Some people came back and said, ‘They wouldn’t sell us any,’ ’’ recalled Bevins, who broadcast Logan Wildcat basketball on WVOW Radio from 1972 through 2015.
 Even by West Virginia’s frenzied standards of 1970s high school basketball, the 1978 state tournament was a tough ticket, especially with the Logan Wildcats as the headliner. The tournament that year, in fact, set a record of 57,035 fans in four days, played in the 7,000-seat Civic Center. (The 13,500-seat Coliseum was still three years down the road.)
 It was the era of coach Willie Akers’ Wild, Wonderful Wildcats and their entertaining fast-break style, giving rise to the community’s insatiable demand for state tournament tickets. Invariably, it seemed, demand far exceeded the school’s allotment. At the 1977 tournament, the Logan allotment was 1,600, but the school’s longtime athletic director, Jim Willis, estimated that 4,000 Wildcat fans had somehow acquired tickets for the championship game at the Civic Center.
 Willis, who also coached Logan baseball, was a creative fellow and generally found a way to satisfy the community’s ticket needs. On opening night of the 1978 tournament in which Logan knocked off Washington Irving at the jam-packed Civic Center, Willis went to work. He knew that many of the WI fans had bought ticket books, giving them admission for the tourney’s four days, and that, in the immediate aftermath of their disappointing loss, they would be eager to sell them.
 As the game was winding down in the Wildcats’ favor, Willis dispatched Wildcat Boosters Club members to the WI side of the Civic Center and, as the WI fans were leaving, the boosters shouted, “We’ll buy your books! We’ll buy your books!’’ They made a good haul and then sold the tickets to Wildcat fans at face value.
 Willis had other methods. Throughout the years, he cultivated good relationships with the state’s high school principals and athletic directors and, at tournament time, would work the phones. If any school did not sell its ticket allotment, the Logan boosters would buy the leftovers and sell them to Logan fans — always at face value.
 Logan’s fans were equally creative. On the final day of every state tournament, the Civic Center box office would offer tickets for the following year’s tourney, and many of the school’s fans bought in advance, fully confident that Willie’s Wild, Wonderful Wildcats would be there.

 At the Smokehouse Restaurant on Stratton Street in downtown Logan, Wildcat hoops conversations once filled the air, along with the aroma of rib roast, a house specialty. The hardcore regulars occupied a special table, and it filled up quickly, especially during breakfast and lunch hours.
 “That’s where you went to talk basketball,’’ said Bevins.
 Logan sits in the heart of what once was a world-renowned coalfield. Employment peaked in 1950, and the industry was still prospering when the Wildcats defeated Washington Irving, Stonewall Jackson and East Bank in the 1978 state tournament.
 Downtown comprised six furniture stores, a variety of men’s and women’s clothing shops, three theaters, three restaurants, two radio stations and a five-days-a-week newspaper, as well as banks, car dealerships and mine repair shops. The Logan County population stood at 50,000 that year; it’s 32,000 now.
 “It was the coal boom. Logan was a vibrant town,’’ said Bevins. “There was no Corridor G. Logan was a self-contained community, and the business community was very vibrant. It just was a bustling place.’’
 “There was more retail business in this town than you can imagine,’’ recalled Dave McCormick, owner of McCormick Furniture, a downtown fixture since 1936.
 Those thriving businesses, however, came to a halt when the Wildcats qualified for the state tournament, as they often did. “You might as well shut your doors,’’ said McCormick, 73, a lifelong Wildcat fan. “There was nobody here.’’

Polling tends to show that, far and away, the three most important issues to voters are the economy, COVID-19 and health care. Trump leads on the economy and trails on the other two. To the extent that issues play a role in a Trump defeat in November, health care will have had some hand in it, and he’s done little to inoculate himself, in fact has further exposed himself.
 His administration backs a lawsuit that seeks to strike down Obamacare, including its popular protections for people with preexisting conditions. This allows Democrats to say – and they say it all the time – that he wants to destroy Obamacare.
 Never mind that the suit is very unlikely to succeed. The background is that in a previous case, the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in Obamacare as a tax. Then, Congress zeroed out the tax. The current case argues that the individual mandate therefore can no longer be upheld as a tax, and further – this is the real stretch – that if this now toothless mandate is thrown out, then the rest of the law has to go as well. There’s no reason to believe that the conservative justices would undertake this legal adventure.
 This makes the politics a worst-of-both-worlds scenario for the White House. By backing the suit, it opens itself up to the attack prior to the election that it will eliminate protections for preexisting conditions, without having any realistic chance of winning when the Court takes up the case after the election.
 It would help at least to have a plan, and that’s Trump’s instinct. But his supposedly imminent health care plan has become as meaningful as the various versions of “infrastructure week.”

Some will say that your vote doesn’t matter. They will point to the simple fact that California will almost certainly go blue in the presidential race, as it has for nearly 30 years, regardless of your preference. This may be true, but it ignores two very simple facts. There is much more than just the presidency up for grabs. For voters who care about increasing rent prices, the housing crisis, internet privacy, police reform and climate change, this election matters. In some cases, there are ballot measures, put directly to the voters, to address these issues. In other cases, voters will be asked to decide who will get a seat at the negotiating table when these issues are discussed and actions are taken (or not taken). One vote rarely makes a difference, true, but it is incredibly common for the fate of districts, ballot measures, mayoral races and more to be decided by a few hundred votes. Often the results affecting some of our most important decisions can be swayed by fewer people than those in a high-school’s graduating class. Put another way: Convincing people not to vote is often easier than convincing them to switch sides, so opting out of the voting process often benefits those in opposition to your interests. Voting is perhaps the single most important thing Americans can do to effect change in their own lives. If voting didn’t matter, why did generations of disenfranchised Americans fight so hard to do so?

The Bethel College football team broke too many records to mention in an 83-35 win over the MidAmerica Nazarene Pioneers Saturday night at Thresher Stadium.
   
 The Threshers broke the team's single-game scoring record by 27 points, the single-game rushing record (610) by 79 yards, the single-game total offense record (746) by 117 yards, the single-game touchdown record (12) and Brayden Francis broke his own record for extra-point kicks (9) by one.
   
 Zach Esau scored a pair of touchdowns to tie the record for career rushing touchdowns (31).
   
 The 0-3 Pioneers, a replacement opponent for Southwestern, which had to suspend play because of the COVID-19 outbreak, got within six points early in the third quarter, but Bethel replied with six touchdowns.
   
 "They have a good team and they were trying to score," Bethel coach Terry Harrison said. "They had some success in the first quarter. They could score in spurts, so we had to keep applying the pressure. I'm proud of the guys. … (A new opponent) hurts our defense more than anything. We only had a couple films. We didn't know anything about them. What they ran in the first quarter, we did not see on film. That was new. Our coaches did a good job, and we played a good second half of defense."
   
 The two teams combined for 1,200 yards in total offense. Camryn Harrison led Bethel with 163 yards rushing and three touchdowns. Esau added 107 yards rushing with two touchdowns. Chantz Scurry rushed for 78 yards and three touchdowns. Rudy Juarez III rushed for 96 yards, scoring on an 87-yard run late in the game. Mason Murry also rushed for a touchdown, finishing with 69 yards.
   
 "We had to do everything we talked about," Camryn Harrison said. "We go over every defense and every situation. The counter option and the dive at the (defensive) back, that got going. … We have a long way to go, but I'm very appreciative of this team. It's a blessing to be here."
   
 Esau was six of seven passing for 136 yards and two touchdowns, both to Tanner Galliart, who finished with 79 yards receiving.
   
 Josh Seabolt had 15 total tackles, including six for a loss and four sacks. He also forced a fumble. Dominic Brown had a fumble recovery and an interception.
   
 "We were prepared, but I don't know if we were prepared for what they had for us," Seabolt said. "They were running a lot of bubbles. We didn't see that on film and weren't prepared for that. We weren't getting any pressure on the QB. That changed in the second quarter. We started getting pressure on him and started making tackles. That's something we've got to get focused on for this week."
   
 MidAmerica was led by Blake Atkins, who hit 19 of 34 passes for 237 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Atkins also rushed for a touchdown. Kobe Hardin had seven catches for 131 yards and two touchdowns. Jairan Manning rushed for a touchdown. Jonas Pippitt returned a fumble for a touchdown.
   
 Bethel is 4-0 and scheduled to play at 2 p.m. Saturday at Tabor. The 0-3 Bluejays were scheduled to play Ottawa, but that game had to be postponed.

I knew going into this game that Isaiah Newcombe was a very good WR. Newcombe's Junior tape was outstanding, and his blazing speed is clearly evident on film. Watching him play in-person for the first time ever was a treat. No one in the Boulder Creek secondary had the speed or coverage skills to cover Isaiah Newcombe on Friday night. His first step off the snap is faster than yours, his acceleration is smooth, and his breaks are crisp. The UCLA commit finished with a team high 10 catches for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also returned a kickoff for a touchdown in the 1st quarter as well. 6A secondaries better shadow a deep safety over the top of him this Fall or Newcombe is going to blow the top off of most teams.

Brendan and Amy Mahan know how lucky they are. Just like nearly every other American, the Mahans have had a lot of stress brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. But, the parents of 11-year-old identical twin boys have found ways to effectively deal with the uncertainties and "new normal", mainly by prioritizing their relationship.
 "Having to ride out those emotional storms and having to support each other and communicate through them, you're bound to come out stronger, assuming you're turning toward one another and not ignoring or turning away," Brendan said. "If you're having those hard conversations with consideration, grace and dignity, then you're going to deepen that relationship."
 The Mahans, who are both 43, live in Shrewsbury. They have similar sentiments as the 47% of 3,000 respondents to the recently-released 6th annual American Family survey who say the pandemic has deepened their commitment to their relationship. That's compared to 9% who disagreed.
 Thirty-two percent of the respondents said there is less than average tension among members of their household. Sixteen percent said the pandemic has caused their families more tension.
 "Absolutely. How could it not?" said Brendan when asked about pandemic-related stress. "Everything from the boys struggling with virtual learning … boredom and uncertainty about what's going on with COVID."
 Some other surveys have reported different findings, including that the stressors of the pandemic are tearing families apart.
 Unlike many families who have heightened stress caused by financial strain, unemployment, homeschooling and quarantine conditions, Brendan said his family is uniquely suited to deal with the pandemic-inflicted turmoil.
 Amy is a biotech laboratory scientist in Lexington, a new job that she took on in March at the beginning of the state of emergency. Unable to go into the office to work, she felt a lot of stress and uncertainty about how well she was doing her job and even if the company would survive the pandemic.
 Brendan, a former sixth-grade English teacher, reduced his self-employment as an ADHD coach so he could take on most of the obligations at home, including homeschooling and entertaining twins Gavin and Nathan, who are in the sixth grade.
 "Theoretically, I should also be cleaning the house. But, there's not enough time," Brendan said. "If there's ever any contentious area, that's where it is. My wife will say 'the house is getting messy and we need to clean this weekend.'"
 The pandemic has helped bring the family closer in many ways. They eat dinner together more often. Brendan and the boys, and sometimes when Amy is available, commit to one adventure a week to break up the monotony of being at home. Their most recent was a visit to the abandoned railway tunnel off Route 70 in Clinton, near the Wachusett Dam.
 "We had to get out of the house. My sons needed time away to manage the stress and pressure of COVID. If we didn't go on one adventure a week, things got more stressful at home," Brendan said.
 Dad and sons do projects together, including using PVC pipes to build hands- free sanitizer stations. During the nice weather, the family has grabbed pizzas and watched movies in the backyard with one other family who socially- distanced on the opposite side of the yard. Every Thursday evening, Brendan has run a Dungeons and Dragons game via Zoom for his boys and four of their friends.
 When Amy gets home from work, she feeds the boys and takes them to kempo lessons, while Brendan conducts virtual ADHD parent coaching groups in his basement office. After everyone is done, the family settles in for a half-hour cartoon show the boys like and then they are read to and readied for bed, allowing the parents some much-needed couple time.
 "It doesn't always go smoothly. But you always have to prioritize relationships over the other stuff. That's how you come out of it stronger. Those social skills and that relationship awareness is critical for keeping the family together," Brendan said, acknowledging that it's different when a family is struggling financially. He said the family tries to help those who are less fortunate. Brendan said he keeps bags containing bottled water, fruit, granola bars and toiletries in his car to hand out to homeless people they encounter. They have helped a friend out financially and when he and the boys pick up pizza, they get extra slices to give to the homeless.
 Mary Ludy, a psychotherapist and a marriage and family therapist in Worcester, said families are stressed, but are finding ways to come together to manage it.
 "People are expressing to me that as much as they're stressed by the pandemic and the political climate that they're putting more effort into getting along at home and communicating well," Lundy said. "Good communication strengthens relationships."
 With therapy sessions available virtually via telehealth, she has seen a 33% increase in the number of clients seeking help with communication and conflict resolution skills.
 Tension and conflict around which parent tends to the kids the most or if a parent is given priority for the amount of time they need to do their job seems to be major concerns.
 Generally, her advice to parents is to be easy on themselves as far as managing all the demands that they're trying to juggle.
 "I have found that a lot of parents have felt very much under pressure and had high expectations to take on new roles and responsibilities as far as their kids' education," Ludy said. "What I'm seeing right now is they are easing up on themselves and relieved since school started. It's much more like classroom learning now, even the remote learning."
 Dr. Timothy Hoffman, a marriage and family therapist in Spencer, said he is not surprised that so many people who responded to the survey said their families have grown stronger during the pandemic. Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said the pandemic made them appreciate their partner more, while 10 percent disagreed.
 "I'm not surprised. I'm suspicious," Hoffman said, questioning whether the relationship is better because of effective marriage counseling and not due to overcoming struggles of the pandemic. Hoffman said when people take surveys, they tend to want to please the people who are asking the questions.
 "I think there is truth in that in tragedies people often come together. Look how wonderful we did for a bit after 9-11 for a common cause," Hoffman said. "... Today, there's also such animosity regarding politics... We've got to have that sense of compassion. That's so lacking today."
 Other surveys have reported different findings than the American Family survey, a joint project of the Deseret News, Utah's oldest continuously published daily newspaper, and the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University. Being forced to spend 24/7 together during the earlier months of the pandemic and confronting major COVID-related stressors have driven a wedge between some couples.
 According to Legal Templates, a company that provides legal documents, the number of divorce agreement sales was 34% higher March through June than the same period in 2019.
 The data also revealed that the quarantine destroyed marriages in less than three weeks, newlyweds were hit hardest, couples in southern states along the Bible Belt were far more likely to seek a divorce, and the rate of divorcing couples with children increased compared to 2019.
 "It's clear from our data that the COVID-19 crisis has increased divorce rates across America -- particularly in newlyweds and couples with young children.
 Unfortunately, the stressors presented during these unpredictable and unprecedented times were too much for many couples to handle.
 It's possible that divorce rates will continue to rise as economic, financial, social, institutional, and psychological turmoil from the COVID-19 virus unfolds," the group wrote.
 Hoffman said "forced togetherness" can be artificial and harmful. He and his wife of 46 years vacation together, but they also take a week apart from each other. It's important for couples to have private, separate time apart, Hoffman noted. Families should rely on faith to get them through these tumultuous times similar to what has happened countless times before.
 "Like World War II. The churches were packed. People relied on the faith that was already there. When trouble comes, they fall back on the tried and true," said Hoffman. "The tried and true is that there's nothing like family. It's the most important unit in our society. If we have strong families, we have a strong society."

L'ACCOGLIENZA   ROVIGO Aule allo stadio Battaglini per accogliere le prime classi del liceo scientifico Paleocapa. Durante la prima settimana di lezione, i docenti della scuola, con la collaborazione degli studenti più grandi, hanno preparato una serie di attività, in parte sportive e in parte ludiche, che hanno permesso ai nuovi allievi di conoscere i nuovi compagni di classe e l'organizzazione della scuola, affacciandosi così gradualmente al mondo dell'istituto.   LEZIONI ALL'APERTO   Parte dell'attività di accoglienza dei nuovi iscritti si infatti svolta allo stadio da rugby che si trova proprio di fronte al liceo di via De Gasperi.   ACCOGLIENZA OTTIMA   «E la cosa - spiega la scuola - ha funzionato bene, suscitando l'entusiasmo dei ragazzi e delle famiglie, soprattutto perché si è riusciti a mettere in campo un programma ben variegato che però teneva conto anche dei protocolli anti-Covid, con tanto di mascherine, lavaggio continuo delle mani e attività distanziate o all'aperto. In questo modo si è riusciti a riproporre qualcosa di simile alle settimane di accoglienza che venivano svolte anche negli anni precedenti, mutandone solo in parte la natura, prestando cioè più attenzione alla salute e all'igiene senza però rinunciare agli aspetti più importanti della socializzazione». Il tutto è stato possibile grazie alla collaborazione di molti insegnanti, che si sono resi disponibili ad animare varie attività sotto la supervisione del professor Emanuele Stievano e di tutta la Commissione Accoglienza.   STUDENTI TUTOR   Inoltre, un supporto fondamentale è arrivato anche dagli studenti tutor, allievi delle classi terminali che, già formati da tempo, hanno assistito le nuove leve, introducendole al Paleocapa. Le sette nuove classi prime hanno così svolto attività di conoscenza reciproca, sono state introdotte alle regole della scuola e ai protocolli anti-Covid, con le attività che sono culminate nella giornata di venerdì 18 settembre al Battaglini, con una intera mattinata impiegata in giochi di collaborazione di classe e di competizione interclasse. Dalla seconda settimana di lezioni, poi, i ragazzi hanno cominciato a tempo pieno le normali attività in classe, svolgendo anche le necessarie prove d'ingresso.   VERIFICHE CONTINUE   Le attività di accoglienza, però, proseguiranno per tutto il primo periodo, con incontri di formazione anche sugli organismi d'istituto e di verifica con gli studenti tutor di quarta e di quinta per valutare l'andamento e l'inserimento dei ragazzi. Gli studenti tutor, infatti, continueranno ad essere presenti per le varie classi durante tutto l'anno scolastico, in modo che gli studenti di prima possano trovare nei loro colleghi più grandi un punto di riferimento importante per loro esperienza scolastica.

Pure Project Brewing is relatively new to Bankers Hill and was in danger of closing before it had a chance to take root. They too offered take out service, which included its ample collection of local craft beer. But that only amounted to half the usual revenue and so half the staff was put on hiatus. Mat Robar, one of the Managing Partners of Pure Project Brewing, found a unique way to use the outdoor dining policy to his advantage. Directly across the street from his tasting room is an empty lot, which is only used as a Christmas tree lot during the holidays. Robar was able to reach out to the property owner and gain permission to create a beer garden on the lot. It was fairly simple to do, and now his business and staffing are back up to 100%. The ground was covered with wood chips, and the garden was supplied with wooden picnic tables and market lights. To adhere to the food mandate, URBN Pizza is onsite with a mobile pizza oven to provide fresh hot pizza for the beer lovers — a match made in heaven.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that more than 100 million food boxes have been distributed in support of American farmers and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box Program.
 Earlier this month, the department announced it had entered into contracts with 50 entities for the third round of food box deliveries, which include contracts to purchase up to $1 billion authorized by President Donald J. Trump.
 “It is incredible to think that in a little more than five months, this food box program has gone from an idea to a reality that has provided more than 100 million boxes of nutritious foods to people in need and along the way has helped to keep farmers and ranchers in business and allowed Americans working in our nation’s food supply chain to get back to work,” Perdue said. “I have been meeting with food banks and recipients across the country and it’s been heartening to hear all the positive feedback on how the program has saved businesses and fed Americans in need. We are now into the third round of deliveries and we’re working harder than ever to continue to build on the success of the program.”

Per primi hanno individuato un virus responsabile di una malattia fino a poco tempo fa incurabile, contribuendo a salvare milioni di vite. Non è un caso che nell'anno del Covid il Nobel per la Medicina sia stato assegnato a tre virologi: Harvey Alter, Michael Houghton e Charles Rice, «per la scoperta del virus dell'epatite C», è l'annuncio dato come da tradizione dal Karolinska Institutet di Stoccolma, in diretta via internet e social.   La loro scoperta, rileva la Fondazione Nobel, «ha rivelato la causa di molti casi di epatite la cui origine non era ancora stata scoperta, aprendo la via alla possibilità di fare diagnosi attraverso l'analisi del sangue e mettere a punto farmaci che hanno salvato milioni di vite». Prima delle ricerche di Alter, Rice e Houghton la causa della maggior parte delle epatiti era sconosciuta. Grazie al lavoro dei tre Nobel oggi sappiamo che l'epatite C è la causa principale di cirrosi epatica e tumore del fegato.

In this case Harris' route comes in behind Emmanuel Sanders, who fakes an outside release before working back inside the man-to-man defender. He then begins to release upfield near the left hashmarks. Tight end Adam Trautman begins in-line and runs the over route from the same side.
 As the weakside linebacker drops to cover Trautman up the seam, Sanders is open to receive the ball and potentially run away from his defender with the deep safety sitting all the way back at the 40-yard line.
 The "divide" part of the concept holds the safety there because he has to account for deep coverage of both downfield routes -- one to each side. If Brees hits Sanders in stride, this is at minimum a solid gain on first down. It's a potential touchdown if he makes the safety miss.
 But Danny Shelton's giant paw had other plans. Despite being blocked well on the play by Nick Easton, he reaches his left arm across Easton's body and gets just enough of the ball to pop it up in the air. Because Sanders was in good position on his route, he was not in good position to to work back for a play on the batted ball.
 Darryl Roberts, who was covering Sanders, breaks back to catch it easily.
 "Just bad luck," Brees said in describing the play.

STOCKHOLM (AP) — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus, a breakthrough that led to cures for the deadly disease and tests to keep the scourge out of the blood supply.
 Americans Harvey J. Alter and Charles M. Rice and British-born scientist Michael Houghton were honored for their work over several decades on an illness that still plagues more than 70 million worldwide and kills over 400,000 each year.
 "For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating hepatitis C virus from the world," the Nobel Committee said in announcing the prize in Stockholm.
 The challenge now is to make these still-expensive drugs more widely available and to stem the spread of the disease among drug users, whose sharing of needles has led to spikes in cases.
 "What we need is the political will to eradicate it" and to make the drugs affordable enough to do it, Alter said.
 Scientists had long known of the hepatitis A and B viruses, spread largely through contaminated food or water and blood, respectively, but were "toiling in the wilderness" to try to explain many other cases of liver disease until the blood-borne hepatitis C virus was identified in 1989, said Dr. Raymond Chung, liver disease chief at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 Now, it's the only chronic viral infection that can be cured in almost all cases within a few months, using one of roughly half a dozen drugs, Chung said. Without such treatment, the virus can lead to permanent scarring of the liver, liver cancer or the need for a transplant.
 In an interview with The Associated Press, Rice said he is most proud that the group's work quickly led to a test to screen donors and make the blood supply safer.
 "We take it for granted that if you get a transfusion, you're not going to get sick from that transfusion. That was not the case before but is certainly the case now," Rice said.
 Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former blood safety expert at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration now at Georgetown University, said that before testing was available, about 1 in 10 blood transfusions carried the risk of passing the virus.
 "Now it's 1 in a million," Goodman said.
 Rice, 68, worked on hepatitis at Washington University in St. Louis and now is at Rockefeller University in New York. Alter, 85, worked for decades at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and remains active there. Houghton, 69, was born in Britain and worked on hepatitis at the Chiron Corp. in California before moving to the University of Alberta in Canada.
 Alter first discovered that blood from patients who did not have hepatitis B could still cause liver inflammation and disease, but for years the cause was unknown. A breakthrough came in 1989, when Houghton and others at Chiron cloned the virus, making its genetic identity known and allowing further research on it, said Nobel Committee member Gunilla Karlsson-Hedestam.
 Later, Rice developed lab tools and methods that confirmed the hepatitis C virus could cause liver disease in chimpanzees and humans, directly contributing knowledge that led to tests and treatments.
 "We have not seen any more cases since 1997" of hepatitis from a transfusion, Alter said. "Currently we can cure virtually anybody who's identified. With that, it's possible to maybe even eradicate this disease over the next decade," as the World Health Organization hopes to do.
 Nobel Committee member Patrik Ernfors drew a parallel between this year's prize and the rush by millions of scientists around the world to find a vaccine to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
 "The first thing you need to do is to identify the causing virus," he said. "And once that has been done, that is, in itself, the starting point for development of drugs to treat the disease and also to develop vaccines against the disorder."
 Alter and Rice are now working on coronavirus research, while Houghton is trying to develop a hepatitis C vaccine. Houghton said manufacturing delays have been a problem but he expects clinical trials to begin next year in many countries, including the U.S., Germany and Italy.
 "To control an epidemic, you need to have a vaccine," Houghton said. For "diseases like gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, we've had cheap drugs available for decades, and yet we still have big epidemics of those diseases."
 John McLauchlan, a professor of viral hepatitis at the University of Glasgow, said the three laureates' discovery has made the global elimination of the disease possible — "the first time we might possibly control a viral infection using only drugs."
 Hepatitis C drugs were around $40,000 when they first came out less than a decade ago. They have come down to roughly a quarter of that but are still out of reach for much of the world.
 India, Eastern Europe, Egypt and parts of Asia, including Mongolia, remain the areas hardest hit.
 Monday's medicine award is the first of six prizes this year being announced through Oct. 12. The others are for work in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics.
 The Nobel Committee often recognizes basic science that laid the foundations for practical applications in common use today.
 "It takes time before it's fully apparent how beneficial a discovery is," said Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel Committee.
 The Nobel comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1.1 million), courtesy of a bequest left 124 years ago by the prize's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.

The Huskies dominated from the beginning, rushing for five touchdowns - four in the first half - and swallowing up Centennials normally-stout running game at the line of scrimmage repeatedly.
 However, it is not the first time in recent memory a Centennial squad with high hopes was disappointed in an early-season loss that still ended in a successful season, but Richard Taylor's squads always bounced back. Just a season ago, the Coyotes fell 71-21 to nationally-ranked Mater Dei (CA) in week 2 but won eight consecutive games to reach the Open Division Playoffs. In 2015, the Coyotes fell on opening night to Long Beach Poly (CA) in week 1 but finished the season with a championship. The same thing happened the year prior, as Centennial fell to Chandler and Basha in weeks 1 and 2 but hoisted the trophy at the end of the campaign.
 To repeat such success, Taylor said, will take a lot of effort. But a bounce back is not out of the question.
 “I would say it depends upon our character, our willingness to look at ourselves in a very critical lens and make the adjustments we need," he said.
 There was not much yelling or projection of emotion from Taylor's coaching staff following the loss. The time for speeches from the coaches will come later, but following a game like this the leading players need to step up and motivate their teammates.
 “What’s more important than what we say is what they say," Taylor said. "Tomorrow and over the weekend, what are they going to say to each other? How are they going to bounce back?”
 And though certainly disappointing, Friday was not all bad for the Coyotes. A few players gave great individual efforts, including senior DJ Gleash, who recorded two tackles for loss and a pass deflection off the defensive line among other stand-out plays.
 He said the loss stings, but hopes the Coyotes use this feeling to give themselves an edge moving forward. Centennial does not want to feel this way again in 2020.
 “It’s a wake-up call for us, as you could see they were running all over us tonight. It just means we need to come together more and make up the slack, in practice" Gleash said.
 “We’re going to take this as a learning experience, and we can’t wait to hopefully see them again in the Open.”
 Centennial (0-1) will visit Mountain Pointe (0-1) on Oct. 9 for week 2 of the football season.

The streaming platform landscape is looking increasingly fragmented. Ever since Amazon Prime Video grew to become a legitimate rival to Netflix, more and more platforms have put their hats in the streaming ring, including Disney+, Peacock, Apple TV+, and even short-format misfires like Quibi.
 While these major players dominate the on-demand video streaming market, the fact that no single service can be considered dominant anymore has opened the door for smaller, more niche streaming services to spring up. You name it, there's now a streaming platform available for it. Gamers, food-lovers, fashionistas, horror fans, culture vultures, anime fans--all of these consumer sub-groups, and more, are catered to in the world of streaming.
 And this isn't just happening in the video space. Specialty streaming services offering particular genres of music are trying to grow in the cracks of the market between Spotify, Apple and Amazon. Video game streaming (cloud gaming)--itself a niche proposition until recently--now includes a whole range of services from which to choose, such as Playstation Now, Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia Geforce Now, and our own company, Antstream Arcade. And this list is only set to get longer as more services enter the space.
 So just how viable is this in the long term? No matter how many streaming services there are, there is always going to be a ceiling on how much users are going to pay and the number of services to which they will subscribe. Especially right now given the current state of the economy, consumers are naturally looking at what services offer the best bang for their buck in terms of what they actually enjoy watching--as opposed to scrolling through extensive and broadly varied catalogues like on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.

LO SFOGO   CASTELFRANCO Non usa mezzi termini Sebastiano Sartoretto. L'avvocato, candidato sindaco per il centrosinistra, ha usato ieri la parola ignavi riferendosi a coloro che hanno preferito non prendere posizione al secondo turno. Un riferimento chiaro alla posizione assunta in particolare da Punto d'Incontro, la civica guidata dal giovane studente Lorenzo Zurlo. «È stato fatto quanto si poteva per vincere questo ballottaggio ha detto ieri Sartoretto la nostra squadra ha fatto un lavoro eccezionale. Anche gli alleati al ballottaggio hanno fatto la loro parte. C'è invece chi non si è schierato e ha preferito fare il pesce in barile al secondo turno regalando probabilmente la città alla Lega. È chiaro chi si è schierato e chi no, a buon intenditor poche parole... Chi doveva capire che si tratta di un momento storico particolare evidentemente non l'ha capito. Hanno preferito fare gli ignavi rispetto ad adottare una linea che consentisse il cambiamento in città».   L'AMAREZZA   Un commento amaro arrivato ieri pomeriggio al termine dello spoglio elettorale. Alla chiusura delle urne, alle 15, Sartoretto e i suoi si sono ritrovati nella sede elettorale in via Preti per seguire lo scrutinio in diretta. C'erano Alessandro Boldo, Claudio Beltramello, Teresa Spaliviero, Gianni Fiscon e molti altri candidati nelle 3 civiche di supporto a Sartoretto. C'era anche il segretario provinciale del Pd, Giovanni Zorzi. I risultati sono arrivati in tempi rapidi rispetto al primo turno. Dopo 15 minuti il dato sulla bassa affluenza. Dopo un'ora circa era già chiara la vittoria di Marcon. Al termine dello spoglio il conteggio indica una percentuale del 48,32% per Sartoretto contro il 51,68% di Marcon. Come avvenuto 5 anni fa, la sconfitta è nei seggi frazionali dove Marcon ottiene consensi molto alti. In centro invece Sartoretto sta sopra ma di poco, e non basta per arrivare primo. «Se guardiamo al risultato di Marcon si nota che quello di Zaia non ha contato quasi nulla ha dichiarato al termine dello spoglio Sartoretto soprattutto nei seggi in centro città. Zaia dovrebbe fare un pensierino su chi ha ai margini dell'impero come pro consoli. Sono grato a tutta la squadra che ha lavorato con grande intensità. La nostra sarà un'opposizione che terrà conto che Marcon ha poco più del 25% del consenso della città. Mi pare che non sia il sindaco di tutta la città». Il riferimento ovviamente sta nel fatto che Marcon ha ottenuto 7.358 voti al ballottaggio su un totale di 30.559 aventi diritto (l'affluenza è stata del 47,24%).   IL SALUTO   Sartoretto rimane nella sede elettorale. Verso le 17.30 Marcon lo raggiunge per congratularsi, è questione di un attimo. Un cenno di saluto, una stretta di mano, poi Marcon si allontana. I sostenitori si trattengono ancora per un po', poi se ne vanno. Una giornata amara per il centrosinistra. «Purtroppo l'esito delle elezioni non penalizza solo Sebastiano e il centrosinistra ma tutti quei beni essenziali per la nostra comunità che abbiamo visto in questi anni essere di poco interesse per la giunta leghista dichiara Giovanni Zorzi, segretario provinciale Pd - dall'ospedale alla cura dell'ambiente fino al lavoro e allo sviluppo economico. Su questi fronti continueremo la nostra battaglia: in consiglio comunale con una squadra di consiglieri di prim'ordine, e tra la gente rafforzando quei legami che si sono costruiti in questi mesi di campagna con quelle espressioni del mondo civico con cui abbiamo condiviso idee, programmi e persone in un inedito spirito unitario. Il punto da cui ripartire subito e di slancio è proprio l'unità che siamo riusciti a ricostruire nel campo dell'alternativa alla Lega, arrivando a superare divisioni decennali».
