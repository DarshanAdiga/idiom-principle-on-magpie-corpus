Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams has produced a touchdown catch in each of his past eight games.
 However Adams says he isn't thinking much about how long he can keep that streak going.
 He has long-range goals in mind instead.
 "At the end of the day, I want to be great and I want this team to be great," Adams said Wednesday. "The awards or minor achievements along the way, the weekly things, hearing stuff like that makes me feel good obviously but that ain't what drives me. What drives me is getting the Super Bowl and ultimately trying to be the best receiver to play this game."

UP has not announced the cane price for the current 2020-21 season, despite mills commencing crushing operations from October-end. “The government has been waiting for the protests to get over. Given the financial position of mills, only a small hike, if at all, was on the cards. But that would have made farmers restive, adding fuel to the agitation fire.
