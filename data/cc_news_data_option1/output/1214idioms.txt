As part of the _Young and Restless_ actress’ post, she also alluded to difficulties the couple had in conceiving and explained, “Our journey to getting pregnant has not been easy and I’m looking forward to talk about it more publicly, hear your stories, share experiences and learn as much I can from all of you.” Hendrickson opened up about two painful and discouraging miscarriages she suffered, one just months after the other, after becoming pregnant for the first time two years ago in October, and spoke of the self-doubt she experienced before finally realizing she wasn't alone after talking with family and friends.

 Mr. Robert Bob Paul Polinsky, age 68 of Gainesville, GA, passed away on Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at Northeast Georgia Medical Center following a recent illness. Bob was born on June 21, 1951, in Coaldale, Pennsylvania to the late Peter Polinsky and Anna Marencik Polinsky. He attended St. Michael's Catholic School and in 1969, he graduated from Panther Valley High School in Lansford, PA. Although he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates straight out of high school, he chose to play college baseball and basketball at Delaware Valley College and graduated in 1973. Bob fulfilled his dream of playing baseball from 1971-1979 with the Yankees and White Sox Organizations. During this time, he and the Syracuse Chiefs had a victory in the Syracuse Governors Cup, in 1976. Bob and the Tacoma Yankees also had a victory in 1978, at the Pacific Coast League Championship game. In 1977, he married Karen his North Star' in Syracuse, New York, and they have been happily married since. He then gave 32 years to U.S. Smokeless Tobacco during which time he was a boss, mentor, and prankster; he finished his career with them as a Regional Vice President of Sales. He made lifelong friends and memories with his colleagues at USSTC. Bob spent 6 years of his retirement with the Batavia baseball team as a pitching coach, where he showed players not only athletic skills, but how to be genuine, caring, hard workers. He was Coach P. Whether he was working full time or retired, Bob embraced his role as a girl dad to his three daughters. He watched any movie they asked him to, coached Tri-City soccer, showed up to every basketball or football game to watch performances, and he cheered loudly at competitions, always wearing his shorts no matter rain or shine. You could be sure to find Bob at the local gym or grocery store, representing the Philadelphia Phillies, the Eagles, or the Syracuse Orange. Bob was a man of Catholic faith, and he always made his girls, Karen, Katy, Kelly and Robyn a top priority with his lawn a close second. When Bob and Karen retired in Gainesville in 2016, their roles as Bob and Mimi were in full effect. They spent time cruising around the golf cart with their grandchildren Garrett and Harrison. Whether friends knew him as Bob, Robert, or Poli, they will remember his beautiful heart, his love of sports, and the amazing man that he was.

Even before I looked in the mirror, I knew my face was puffy. It might have had something to do with the fact that I could feel my cheeks touching my eyebrows or maybe that my lips felt like they were the size of eggplants. I knew some women paid good money for lips that looked like mine, but at that moment, I suspected it was probably not a good look for me.      When I finally did take a peak in the mirror, I realized it wasn't just regular old, "I probably slept on my face" puffy. It was more like, "I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy" puffy. It was clear, something dramatic had happened while I slept. It was like the Tooth Fairy had taken out a hit on me.      "What happened to your face?" said my husband when I emerged from the bathroom.      "What do you mean?" I said, feigning ignorance.      "You're all, um, puffy."      "Oh?" I said. "I hadn't noticed."      "Really?" he said.      "OF COURSE NOT," I boomed. "How could I not notice that I woke up looking like a popover?"      He backed up slowly out of the bedroom, realizing this was one land mine he did not want to step on.      "Call the doctor," he shouted from the other room.      I should mention that this wasn't the first time I've had a puffy face. I experienced something similar years ago when I had my kids. When most women get pregnant, their feet swell. For me, it was my face. Of course, this may have had more to do with all the donuts I ate while I was pregnant than the pregnancy itself, but for arguments sake we'll just say it was pregnancy.      However, I was not pregnant now, and unless, by some miracle of middle age magic, wouldn't ever be again, so it clearly wasn't a hormonal thing. I also didn't recall eating anything the day before that I might have had a reaction to, such as blowfish poison, which could leave you looking like an actual blowfish, assuming you didn't die first.      Realizing I couldn't figure this out myself, I scheduled a televisit with my doctor.      "Your face is very puffy," my doctor said to me when she came on screen.      "See, that's why I chose you as my doctor," I said. "Because of your keen observational skills and masterful assessments."      "It's my superpower," she said. "So, what did you eat last night?"      "Nothing out of the ordinary."      "New cosmetics?" she said.      "Nope."      "Well, I'd say it definitely looks like an allergic reaction." She stared at my face in silence for a few moments.      "What did you wear yesterday?" she said.      "Um, a new wool sweater. A Turtleneck."   "Is your neck itchy?"      "Yes, actually, it is." I said. I had been so busy fretting about my puffy face that I hadn't noticed my itchy neck.      "You had an allergic reaction to the wool," she concluded.      "Wow. Okay," I said, recalling how uncomfortable I'd been at the end of the day. "So, that's something new. Are you sure?"      "Did you snore last night?" she asked.      "Actually, I did."      "Well, that's that," she said. "You either had a reaction to the sweater or your husband tried to smother you with a pillow."

Don’t set your monitor in front of the window; the bright background light shining behind the screen causes eye strain.
 • Place your chair at least arm’s length from the screen so that it can be seen without reading glasses or squinting.
 • Add LED tape lighting behind your monitor or under a desk for diffused light.
 • Use solar shades to soften lighting and lessen heat.
 After setting up a glare-free workstation, add task lighting. Use dedicated light sources such as desk lamps for tasks like paperwork and filing. Place direct task lights on the opposite side of the hand you write with to avoid casting shadows onto your work.
 Finally, add accent lighting for visual appeal. Frame your workspace with desk lamps or install a permanent fixture on a dimmer switch, such as a pendant hung directly over the desk. Wall sconces can throw light on decorative objects in the room.

  It certainly would have been a shame if Rehbein's junior season ended short of a trip to the state meet. She wouldn't have made all-state in two events and top 16 in two others.


   


  But Rehbein did get to accomplish all that, and for that she's The Examiner's Girls Swimmer/Diver of the Year.


   


  Rehbein capped her season with a second-place finish in the 100-yard breaststroke in the Class 2 state meet at the St. Peters Rec-Plex outside St. Louis. Rehbein finished in a personal-best 1 minute, 5.64 seconds, just shy of the 1:05.52 turned in by Kirkwood's Alyssa Dennis. Swimming a new PR thrilled her; coming up short of a gold medal did not.


   


  "I was upset at the time but now it's just fuel to the fire," said Rehbein, who took seventh in the race as a sophomore. "I have next season to come back and know what it feels like and hopefully not let it happen again."


   


  Rehbein, who also placed 14th in the 200 individual medley, joined Jenna Wright, Sydney Franklin and I'yana Foster to take sixth in the 200 medley relay for another all-state performance. The same foursome also won the 400 freestyle relay consolation final, securing a 10th-place team finish for the Wildcats.


   


  "Going into the season, if someone would have asked how do you think you'll do, I would have never guessed that I would not only be second in the 100 breast, but that both of our relays would make top 16 and I would make top 16 in both individuals as well," Rehbein said. "We improved a lot as a team."


   


  Rehbein was having a successful season even before state. In the Suburban Big Six meet, she passed four swimmers over the final two legs to win the 200 individual medley and also struck gold in the 100 breaststroke and 400 freestyle relay.


   


  "Annemarie deserves all the success that she has," Blue Springs swimming coach Kevin Bigham said at the Big Six meet. "She works her butt off all offseason. She swims for a really intense club team and she's always working on getting better and achieving her goals. So we're just really happy for all she's achieved."


   


  While her high school season went off without a hitch, Rehbein's club season with Empire Swim Club has been put on hold by the coronavirus. The club got in three weeks of training, but its first big meet was canceled. And since Empire works out in school district pools, there's no place to train for the time being.


   


  That's not a problem now, Rehbein said. Last week was spring break in Blue Springs, and she spent it with her family in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Ensured that there were signs of coronavirus cases in the area before they left March 16, they decided to still make the trip.


   


  "There's people here, but it's very quiet," Rehbehin said from Cabo. "We've been a couple times and it's significantly less (crowded) than it was before."


   


  Rehbein realizes she's in for more down time this week and possibly longer. But in time she expects to be back in the pool competing for Empire and preparing for her senior season.


   


  "She continues to improve her training and racing habits, so the sky's the limit for Annemarie," Bigham said.

One fulfilled that last role, and then some, in the unimaginably tough story he heard at a gig in Louisville, Kentucky. Gough was hanging out with fans in the bar afterwards, celebrating a good show. But what about the kid nervously loitering by the bar, clearly keen to speak but initially too shy to do so? ‘He said he wanted to thank me because he’d been on the verge of killing himself. “I had a gun to my head, and your song came on,”’ Gough relates. The fan had been listening to The Shining, the brass-and-cello-rich opener on The Hour of Bewilderbeast.

The renders in question were leaked by _OnLeaks_ and _iGeeksBlog_. Now, let's inspect the leaked renders for a comprehensive look at the design. First up, we get that long-rumored punch hole camera on the top left corner of the display. The smartphone continues to feature the thin speaker grill on the top and a thick chin at the bottom. Moving to the back, we see the quad-camera setup on the smartphone. Here, three cameras are aligned in a vertical line as noticed on OnePlus 7T Pro. The fourth camera sensor is located on the left of the camera sensor. One can also see a dual-tone LED flash unit with some kind of focus unit below the fourth camera.
