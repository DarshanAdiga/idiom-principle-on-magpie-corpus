BARKER — Barker Central School District may be generating as much power as it uses as early as spring 2021 with the installation of solar panels on four acres of district property along Haight Road.
 The project has been in the works for awhile and all the pieces are coming together, district Superintendent Jacob Reimer said this week.
 The work will be done by Solar Liberty, a New York-based solar panel installation company. To meet NYSEG regulations, the size of the solar array has been cut back, but Reimer said the savings will be about the same, $70,000 a year, from the solar array and a few related projects.

 Acting Niagara County Judge Sheila DiTullio set the start of jury selection for Feb. 1 during a video conference Wednesday with the current lawyers on the case. However, the new trial date means that current Niagara County District Attorney Caroline Wojtaszek will not be around to handle the prosecution she has championed since a cold case investigation of the 27-year-old homicide led to the arrest of Joseph Belstadt in April 2018.
 Wojtaszek is scheduled to step down from her post on Dec. 31. She is on the ballot in the November general election to succeed retiring Niagara County Judge Sara Sheldon.

From there, things get thorny.
 "LX 2048" is a science fiction film of words and ideas rather than of action and effects. Oh, there are some cool visuals, including a scene of Adam shaving with his laser razor (try saying that three times fast). There's also some hard-to-comprehend pseudoscience talk of the future about chips versus virtual reality gear, and some philosophical claptrap emanating from the mouth of a virtual woman who suddenly appears "in the flesh."
 Toward the end, Moshe tosses in some double crossing, a monologue from "Hamlet" (along with a reference to Shakespeare's real-life pal Richard Burbage), and an interesting concept called "virtual assassination."
 "LX 2048" is an odd little movie, but it's got something going for it. So many films tend to run out of steam before their conclusion. In this one, things really pick up near the end.
 "LX 2048" will be available on VOD and various streaming services on Sept. 25.

Lorenzo Colombo is glad that his hard work has paid off after marking his full debut for Milan with a goal in Thursday's 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt.
 The academy product put Milan 2-1 ahead in their Europa League third qualifying round victory with a close-range finish at the back post.
 In doing so, at the age of 18 years and 200 days he became the youngest player to score for the Italian giants since M'Baye Niang in 2012.
 Lorenzo was brought into the side in place of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who tested positive for coronavirus ahead of the match, and believes he made the most of his chance to shine.
 "It was a great opportunity for me to demonstrate all the work I did to get here," he told DAZN.
 "I wanted to play for the team because it took a collective performance to go through. It was very difficult, but now we have to quickly recover.
 "It is a unique emotion for me. I have always worked for this. There is also a lot to do - I have not done anything yet.
 "I am happy for the goal and for the passage to the next round but tomorrow we will go back to work on the training ground."
 Colombo has been linked with a move away to gain some first-team experience, having been restricted to two substitute outings last term, but he ruled out an exit this window.
 "I want to stay, absolutely," he said. "I was at Milan as a child and have always worked for this. I want to stay here for a long time."
 Asked if head coach Stefano Pioli has taken him off the transfer market, Colombo replied: "I had taken myself off it before him. I want to stay here."
 Milan were pushed all the way by Bodo/Glimt, with the in-form Norwegians taking the lead through Kasper Junker before Hakan Calhanoglu and Colombo hit back for the hosts.
 Calhanoglu gave Milan a two-goal cushion but Jens Hauge set up a nervy finish and Bodo/Glimt wasted a glorious chance to take the game into extra time right at the death.
 Pioli admitted his side had to work hard for their place in the play-off phase, where Rio Ave - surprise winners against Besiktas on Thursday - now await next week.
 "Suffering is part of these games," the Milan boss said. "We faced a well- placed side. We were good at staying in the match and didn't drop our heads when they went ahead.
 "As we have seen, all games are difficult. We knew it would be a very challenging match today with some important players out.
 "Now we have a game on Sunday before preparing for the play-off which is also an important goal for us."
 Pioli also reserved some praise for teenage forward Colombo after only learning of Ibrahimovic's absence on the morning of the game.
 "He was very excited and it showed. We are talking about an 18-year-old boy called in at the last moment," he said.
 "He is an exceptional boy with his head on his shoulders, who has a great desire. He's a very young boy and I'm happy he scored on his first start as he did in all the friendlies."

They were in the car together for five hours during the ride home to Hempstead, he said. The daughter wore a mask, he recalled. The next day, she got tested for COVID-19 and the result came back positive.
 Within a few days, Ken Vicino said he became sick and arranged to be tested. His result came back positive, as well, he said. He said he is now recuperating from the contagion.
 But he said he is angry and disappointed there was no requirement that students who had earlier tested negative at the campus be re-tested before they were released from quarantine and before returning to their homes.
 "They shouldn't have released these kids, No. 1," he said. "No. 2, if they were going to release thousands of kids back to communities, they should have done another test because it takes three or four days after the exposure for you to become positive. They should have at least quick-tested them to see if they had it or not."
 About a week before she returned home, Vicino said, his daughter participated in a pool test for coronavirus at the campus, and that showed no sign of the virus in the saliva samples collected from that group of students.
 After the result came back a couple of days later, he said, she spent three days in quarantine.
 If she was not infected at the time of the pool test, there was ample time for her to become infected by the time of the trip home, Vicino said.
 "It was absolutely handled wrong," the father said. "For months, we had been listening to Governor (Andrew) Cuomo talking about the importance of testing, testing, testing, and the importance of science, science, science. But when this happened, everything that happened was the exact opposite of what they were telling us for six months."
 Vicino said he was treated at a hospital near his home for one day and is now recuperating. His daughter has recovered. He said his wife, an elementary school teacher, had to stay home the first two weeks of the school year due to quarantine rules.
 "For a blunder this big to happen this many months into what has been going on is ridiculous," he said.
 Vicino said he questions why state officials emphasized the need to follow public health guidance, yet did not adhere to the recommendations of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert.
 In a Sept. 2 interview on NBC's "Today" show, Fauci said sending students home after they may have been exposed to virus-infected individuals is "the worst thing you could do."
 "When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection," Fauci said.
 CNHI reported earlier this month SUNY administrators in Albany gave the green light to the Oneonta campus reopening plan, as well as most other SUNY campuses, despite the fact they did not require the pre-testing of students when the semester began.
 The head of the United University Professionals (UUP) faculty union, Otsego County Board of Representatives Chairman Dave Bliss and Oneonta Mayor Gary Herzig had all advocated that the reopening plan include a requirement students be tested upon arriving on campus.

 # Democrats to redraft virus relief in bid to jump-start talks
 Andrew Taylor
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ – House Democrats are going back to the drawing board on a huge COVID-19 relief bill, paring back the measure in an attempt to jump-start negotiations with the Trump administration.
 The Democratic-controlled chamber could also pass the $2 trillion-plus measure next week if talks fall through to demonstrate that the party isn’t giving up on passing virus relief before the election.
 The chamber passed a $3.4 trillion rescue measure in May but Republicans dismissed the measure as bloated and unrealistic. Even as Democrats cut their ambitions to $2.2 trillion or so, Senate Republicans have focused on a much smaller rescue package in the $650 billion to $1 trillion range.
 An aide familiar with the leadership discussions and authorized to characterize them said the new bill would total about $2.4 trillion and is likely to contain additional relief for the airline and restaurant sectors, which have been especially slammed by slumps in business from the virus. The aide requested anonymity to characterize the closed-door talks.
 “We’re trying to figure out how to move a negotiation forward because we believe the American people need some help. And so we’re going to try,” said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “Our chairs are looking at everything again and the hope is that we can come up with something.”
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., commissioned the effort, which caused a buzz in Washington’s lobbying industry – and whose news appeared to briefly spike the stock market – even as hopes for a deal between the Democratic- controlled House, the GOP-held Senate, and the White House still seem to be a longshot.
 “We are still striving for an agreement,” Pelosi told her colleagues, according to the aide. “If necessary, we can formalize the request by voting on it on the House floor.”
 Recent talks between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have gone nowhere, but neither side wants to officially give up.
 Republicans reacted cooly, especially at the prospect of a partisan floor vote if the effort doesn’t spark constructive talks.
 “It’s a waste of time,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, saying a Democrats- only approach won’t go anywhere. “She could pass 10 more partisan bills. That won’t get us an inch closer.”
 Thursday’s developments come as moderate “front line” Democrats in competitive reelection races have been pressing leaders like Pelosi to become more flexible. Some participated in drafting a $1.5 trillion bipartisan bill that fell flat when outlined last week. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, however, say they are uninterested in a “message vote” that offers political cover but fails to catch on with the Senate or the White House.
 Pelosi had largely dismissed the protests from moderates to pare back leadership COVID demands or schedule a floor vote. Some of the dissenters, however, had threatened to sign onto a GOP procedural effort to pass a renewal of aid for small businesses, a step with the potential to embarrass her.
 “We’re focused on a negotiation, we want to get a deal with Secretary Mnuchin and the Senate because we want to get people help, not just messages,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
 The revised measure is likely to contain scaled-back proposals to give aid to state and local governments, $1,200 direct payments to most Americans, more than $100 billion in aid to schools seeking to safely reopen, and funding for renewed pandemic jobless benefits and production of a COVID vaccine.
 “I think we’re headed towards a resurgence of the virus in the fall, and until we defeat the virus, you’re not going to have full economic recovery,” said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass.

As we sat through successive red and green lights and waited for trains to pass by in the crowded SoDo district of Seattle on Wednesday, sports editor Jordan Nailon and I both had the same thought at the same time.
 “Boy,” we thought, “it’s really weird that we’re going to a Mariners game, but nobody else is.”
 On the sidewalks there were no groups in teal and blue huddled under canopies as the rain dumped from above. There were no street vendors hawking sausages and peanuts or flipping programs and team gear, or even hustlers peddling extra tickets. The numerous watering holes around the ballpark were shuttered and empty. Parking lots weren’t guarded by a sign and an attendant taking money. There were no converging streams of fans, with backpacks and snacks in tow, walking north to T-Mobile Park to take in the last vestiges of batting practice and find their assigned seats.

Apparently, Harrison Ford wanting Han Solo to initially die in _Return of the Jedi_ wasn’t the darkest factor the capper to the Authentic _Star Wars_ Trilogy needed to do. In actual fact, in keeping with notes from a gathering between George Lucas and _Star Wars_ franchise author Lawrence Kasdan, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was going to turn into the following huge dangerous within the galaxy, swearing to kill the Insurgent fleet himself as soon as Darth Vader had died in his arms. Nonetheless, that concept was shortly shot down, and regardless of Kasdan being on board along with his preliminary pitch, Lucas modified his thoughts. Cue the Ewok fireworks!
