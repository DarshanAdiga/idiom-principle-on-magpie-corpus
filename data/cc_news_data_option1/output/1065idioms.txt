"If you make the 11 o'clock news, you want to make sure your customers know you're still in business," she says. "Otherwise, you've lost a good portion of your market share.

The Lausanne-based IOC is set for emergency talks Tuesday as doubts grow over whether it remains feasible to hold the Games during the coronavirus emergency, with world sport largely grinding to a halt.
 Senior IOC member Dick Pound suggested last month that a final call would be made by late May.
 But Coates, who is also president of the Australian Olympic committee, disputed the timeline.
 "The IOC didn't recognize any dates that Dick came up with and I think Dick backed off that as well," he told Tuesday's Sydney Morning Herald. "It's all proceeding to start on the 24th of July.
 "It's never been the IOC's position. It was Dick's idea," he added of the apparent deadline. "There is four months to go."
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach have repeatedly insisted preparations should continue as scheduled even as the virus scare intensifies.
 The IOC's executive board is due to meet via conference call to prepare an "information exchange" ahead of a series of talks with athletes' representatives, National Olympic Committees and International Federations.
 The issue of qualifying is expected to be a particular focus of the telephone meeting, after a long list of events were called off.
 "The difficulty for those who have qualified or will qualify is they won't get any more international competition," admitted Coates, who said it will also be difficult to get athletes into Japan without further spreading coronavirus.
 "Japan has got some restrictions on athletes but I know that the Chinese are probably the best organized," he said.
 "The Chinese are in various parts of Europe and the last I heard is they're bringing them all together in a university in Paris where they'll be fully contained, 600 of them.
 "They will go straight from confinement there, straight into Japan. They won't put anyone on a plane who has got coronavirus."
 Coates will go into a two weeks' isolation on his return home after Australia imposed strict travel rules to counter the spread of the virus.
 He welcomed the tough measures being taken by Australia and other countries to tackle the growing crisis, but criticized Europe's response.
 "Despite a bit of personal inconvenience, I'm very happy that countries are taking these steps that clearly some of the European countries should have taken earlier," he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is alleging that a foreign disinformation campaign is underway aimed at spreading fear in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic, three U.S. officials said Monday.
 On Sunday, federal officials began confronting what they said was a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to sow fears of a nationwide quarantine amid the virus outbreak. Agencies took coordinated action Sunday evening to deny that any such plans were put in place, as they tried to calm a nation already on edge by disruptions to daily life caused by the virus.
 The three U.S. officials did not name the foreign entity they believe to be responsible. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
 "Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE," tweeted the National Security Council Sunday night. "There is no national lockdown." The NSC encouraged Americans to follow official government guidance.
 States and municipalities have banned large public gatherings, closed schools, bars and restaurants, and advised people to exercise so-called social distancing to slow the spread of the virus.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday issued new guidance recommending against indoor gatherings larger than 50 people for the next eight weeks.
 The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said Sunday that Americans should aim to severely curtail leaving their homes, but did not indicate the government would order such a move. He was specifically questioned on whether he'd like to see a "national lockdown."
 "I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing," said Fauci, a member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus. He heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
 Rumors about the government's response to the spreading virus have circulated online for weeks, prompting authorities in several states to urge residents to seek out trusted sources in government and news.
 On Sunday, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said he's been asked about the rumors by "senior leaders in business, healthcare, politics."
 "I've had community leaders and elected officials all text me or call me and say 'I understand on Monday you're basically going to order everybody to shelter in place for two weeks. The message has been exactly the same."
 "We have no plans to do that."
 He said it shows the need for residents to find trusted sources of news and information, such as legitimate news organizations or public health authorities.
 "There's so much information out there," Baker said. "Some of which is legit, but a lot of it is wild speculation."
 Texts and posts suggesting Texas, Washington and New York states would be shutting down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus escalated with screenshots of text messages circulating online that claimed that within 48 to 72 hours Trump would place the U.S. under a two-week quarantine.
 New York City officials last week debunked a claim passed around in text messages claiming the city's Metro North trains, connecting commuters from the suburbs to the city, would be shut down and that other train service would be limited. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee also said claims that the state would soon be under quarantine were untrue.
 Andy Carvin, a senior fellow at The Atlantic Council, a Washington based Think Tank, said the rumors circulating via text are the toughest to trace because they often percolate from private messaging platforms and texts, then are copy-and-pasted into public social media posts.
 "There's no way to know if these are organic or intentional, unfortunately, because the sentiment contained in them is so plausible that they could very easily be borne out of home-grown rumors," he said.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.
 The worldwide outbreak has sickened about 175,000 people and left more than 6,700 dead. In the United States, there have been about 3,800 cases and scores of deaths.

The international situation is increasingly deteriorating as well in ways that could not have been fully expected, and thus priced into the market as a reasonable risk, just a few weeks ago. Canada (EWC) announced they are suspending all entry except by its citizens and, for the moment, U.S. citizens. Germany (EWG) and Spain (EWP), and perhaps France (EWQ), are closing their borders and creating serious shakeups to the Schengen Area of free movement. The situation in Italy appears to be getting worse rather than better as the hopes for a quick defeat of coronavirus in it and the rest of Europe and the world fade.
 ## Markets Price In The Heretofore Unimaginable
 These are all risks that the market hadn't truly been expecting even as late as last week and undoubtedly contributed to Monday's historic drop, the worst percentage drop since the Black Monday of 1987 and just slightly beating out the Black Monday of 1928 for the Dow's second-largest percentage drop in history, wiping out the gains from Friday's optimistic rally and putting equity markets at new lows once again. On a positive note, however, as contrasted with Black Thursday last week, bonds initially were in the red but climbed up and eventually rallied - a positive sign for belief in the long- term stability of the economy and its companies even amid short-term trouble.
 Unfortunately, short-term trouble still looks very probable for the upcoming few weeks. Many of the drastic lockdowns that U.S. state and local governments are implementing are extremely disruptive to everything, from consumer life to business sales to even any company being able to organize its employees coherently. Goldman Sachs already estimates this quarter's U.S. GDP to be -5% and full-year growth to be a meager 0.4%, significantly downgraded from even just a few weeks ago, let alone before the coronavirus pandemic.
 The turbulence in the market often seems indiscriminate, and that's because it largely should be, as the shrinking of the consumer and business activity may affect some sectors particularly hard but still affects them all. Furthermore, when more extreme actions are taken, such as legal curfews and travel restrictions, that no longer places the consumer and business activity in the hands of the market but essentially reduces it to zero for the time being.

However severe COVID-19 proves to be — and we won’t know until the roll-out of more testing — I’m confident our county and our city will meet the challenge. In the process of addressing this crisis, the amount of suffering will depend, in part, on the response behaviors we adopt. As I write this, I’m pleased at the dramatic uptick in the manner in which citizens are responding. It’s better to overreact than to under-react.
 As we respond to the virus directly in front of us, let’s also take the opportunity to learn from the experience. Lessons already gained can include the critical importance of planning for the future, basing public policy on science and expertise, and the transparent free flow of information to the public. Learning these and other lessons can do us well for future challenges, which will surely come.
 For now, the call to action is to err on the side of caution and follow the advice coming from experts. The last thing we want for our city is for our well-trained and hardworking medical colleagues, and the excellent medical facilities we have in our community, to be overwhelmed with COVID-19, along with the usual medical issues that pass through the system. Regardless of how other communities respond, in our region we all can play a role in flattening the curve of cases, so that everyone needing medical attention in Greenville, for whatever reason, can obtain it.
 I’ve seen our nation respond post-9/11 admirably with prudence and neighborly support. As an elected official and as a private citizen, I’ve seen our city respond the same way to hurricanes. Now — let’s do it again.

You can apply other makeup over the top, so you don't have to worry too much about color-matching. The tint is really there to make it easier to wear if you have a medium to deep skin tone. If you opt for the non-tinted, you'll get more of a traditional white liquid sunscreen formula that absorbs easily into the skin.

The league and NHL Players' Association told players Monday they can go home -- even outside of North America -- and must self-isolate through March 27 while the season is on hold. But the NHL also cautioned that it will not be able to even provide guidance on the potential reopening of team practices for another 45 days, which could push any potential return to play into May.
 The new directives come on the heels of the CDC's recommendation against gatherings of 50 or more people in the U.S. for the next eight weeks. The NHL said "depending on world developments," consideration will be given to reopening facilities after the self-quarantine period ends in late March but practices for the 31 teams would not happen late April -- at the earliest.
 "I think in light of the CDC recommendations, it's hard to foresee that we're looking at much happening here in March or even April, in my opinion," NHL player agent Jay Grossman said.
 That's a major switch from Friday, when the league held out the possibility of players being able to return to team facilities and working out and skating in small groups.
 The latest decision leaves open questions as to whether the NHL can complete its regular season, which was suspended Thursday with 189 games remaining, and whether it might have to alter its playoff format to avoid the postseason from pushing into the summer months.
 Last week, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he remained optimistic about resuming play and still awarding the Stanley Cup, which has been handed out every year since 1893 except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak, and 2005 when a lockout wiped out the entire season.
 Though the NHL followed the NBA's lead in suspending its season, Bettman declined to place a time frame on how long the "pause" would last. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver last week said his league's hiatus would likely last at least a month.
 "The pause will be until it's appropriate and prudent and safe to start back up," Bettman had said. "Nobody knows how long the hiatus may be. Nobody, even the medical community, can predict it with certainty."
 Bettman and NHL and NHLPA executive director Don Fehr each said Friday he was not aware of any player testing positive for coronavirus.
 On Monday, Arizona Coyotes defenseman Aaron Ness became the first NHL player publicly known to have been tested for COVID-19. Ness' agent, Neil Sheehy, said results came back negative after his client followed NHL guidelines to seek out testing for flu-like symptoms.
 "He never thought he had it to begin with, to be quite honest," Sheehy said. "What happened is the league was saying if you have a sore throat, if you have a runny nose, if you have a cough, call the trainer and don't come to the rink, and so he did that."
 The NHL's new directive in allowing players to return home led to players and coaches scrambling to make travel plans.
 In Buffalo, New York, Sabres forward Marcus Johansson initially hoped to travel home to Sweden on a flight out of nearby Toronto. Those plans changed when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the country was shutting its borders except to Canadians and Americans, while also imposing a 14-day self-quarantine to those entering the country.
 Johansson was instead attempting to book a flight home through New York City.
 In an email to The AP, NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said there was little the league could do regarding travel restrictions.
 "It's a consequence of where we find ourselves. Nobody's fault," Daly wrote.
 The U.S. government has imposed a travel ban from Europe for non-citizens that extends until mid-April. There are currently 233 European players on NHL rosters, including leading scorer Leon Draisaitl from Germany, and there are under contract in the minors. How many might return home is unknown.
 "I've spoken to some players who are doing their best to obviously scramble to return to the safest, most comfortable environment that they can get to at this point," Grossman said.
 In the meantime, the American Hockey League followed the NHL in a decision reached by its executive committee on Monday. The 31-team league announced the indefinite suspension of its regular season won't be lifted before May, and was also recommending its teams work on returning players to their primary homes.
 Overseas, the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League took a one-week pause during its playoffs to determine a new format and schedule for its six remaining teams. The decision came after Finland-based Jokerit and Kazakhstan- based Barys Nur-Sultan pulled out of the playoffs amid the pandemic.

"If for some unforeseen reason the House is unable to return, the governor will have the ability to keep in place the state of emergency," said House Majority Leader Jon Burns, a Newington Republican.
 The suspension of standardized testing means the tests won't count for 20% of grades for high school students who take end-of-course exams. It also means the state won't be able to issue grades for schools and school districts. Woods said he would ask the state Board of Education to ratify his actions at its next meeting. He said he would seek maximum flexibility from the U.S. Department of Education.
 Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A said it would close its dining rooms while keeping drive-thru windows open, while the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven suspended in- person dining and drinking in restaurants and bars. Fort Benning canceled all graduations.
 As Georgia's oldest city prepared to go without its hugely popular St. Patrick's Day parade for the first time in 99 years, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah canceled its annual St. Patrick's Mass at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.
 Both the Mass and parade had been scheduled Tuesday before virus worries had intensified. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson announced last week that the St. Patrick's Day parade had been called off.

OUR TAKE.  Outdated beer was starting to be a problem even before this catastrophe.  This will undoubtedly make it much worse over the next months. But at the risk of sounding too Darwinian, in the long term this will also likely thin the ranks of lower quality and/or low sales beer on the shelves and in taprooms.

Regisseurin Katharina Kutil hat den Probenplan bereits minutios ausgearbeitet. „Bei schlechtem Wetter proben wir im Bootshaus Delphin", sagt Geschaftsfuhrerin Bader. Doch weil die Buhne dort nicht so groß ist, sollen die Kunstler so schnell wie moglich zur Freilichtbuhne am Bierer Berg umziehen. Die Kulissen werden derzeit in einer Schreinerei gezimmert. Mit dem Modell des Buhnenbildes ist Bader sehr zufrieden.

Thus, while Joe Biden may not be as progressive as many of us would like to see in a candidate, for just that reason, he is undoubtedly the most acceptable candidate to the largest number of people – including disillusioned Trump voters who would never vote for a socialist. That’s why Trump is so afraid of him that he got himself impeached trying to smear him, and that alone speaks volumes. Trump knows the source of his biggest threat. That's why he's all but campaigning for Bernie. So no matter how tantalizing Bernie's vision of "pie in the sky" and free unicorn rides are to the imagination, if we want Trump out of office, we’re going to have rely on clear thinking and common sense, not the pursuit of unfulfillable promises and emotional fanaticism.

The days of Netflix being a platform in which you could watch favorites you already know and love are not over, but this is so much bigger than that. It’s a network of its own with its own shows and movies, and it’s making people big stars. Sierra Capri is one of those stars. She’s well-known for her role as Monse Finnie on the hit series “On My Block,” and she’s becoming a household name because of it. She’s young, beautiful, talented, and someone we should all get to know a bit more before her star shines so bright the fun facts get lost in the mix.

Communities around the globe are being affected by the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, and Essex is no different.
 Schools and businesses are being shut down while events are being cancelled by the minute. Stores across town are running low on inventory as some shoppers stock up on food, cleaning supplies, and paper goods.
 Other shoppers, however, are just trying to find their usual amount of products.
 “My daughter needed some, and I need some,” said a 74 year-old Essex woman who asked not to be identified after purchasing a small amount of toilet paper. “I think it's sad that people are panicking. I'm not--yet, anyway. Just be more careful.”
 In addition to schools being closed until April 6, the Essex Middle School’s eighth-grade trip to Washington, D.C. and the sixth-grade trip to Cape Cod this spring have both been cancelled.
 Pitchers and catchers at Essex High were scheduled to start practicing on Monday (March 16) with the rest of the spring teams having a start date of March 23. However, the Vermont Principals’ Association announced Monday morning that it would mirror the governor’s state of emergency timeline for school closures and pushed back the beginning of practices until at least April 6.
 Many people are heeding the advice of healthcare professionals and practicing social distancing--avoiding contact with the public as much as possible. Others, however, are trying not to let the situation disrupt their normal routines.
 Tristan Woodward, a former Essex resident who now lives in Fletcher, visits The EDGE Sports & Fitness in town after work five days per week. He was found heading into the facility Friday afternoon--being shocked at how few cars there were upon arrival.
 “I am very surprised,” he said, “because every time I come here, this parking lot is chock full of people. Today, there's nobody here; it’s so rare for me to see this on a Friday.”
 He also said that he wasn’t planning to do anything additional while working out.
 “I wipe down the equipment every time I use it,” Woodward commented. “I don't foresee myself doing anything different or out of the ordinary. I think people are definitely taking this thing a little bit too far.”
 The Essex Westford School District (EWSD) is trying to assist families following the governor’s announcement that schools would be closed by March 18 until, at least, April 6. The district said it is collaborating with the state to provide childcare options for healthcare workers and others who are essential to the COVID-19 response.
 While schools are closed, EWSD will continue to provide meals for its students. Starting March 19, breakfast and lunch will be bagged at Essex High and can be picked up with a drive-thru style service at Maple Street Park (8-10 a.m.), Essex Elementary (9-11 a.m.) and Westford School (10 a.m.-12 p.m.) Monday through Friday. The pair of meals is available at no cost for all children 18 and under--no application or prior approval being needed.
 With property taxes being due by March 16 and dog licenses being required by April 1, a dropbox by the door of the town offices located at 81 Main Street became a helpful way to limit the amount of people going inside.
 While the doors to the Brownell Library will be closed to the public starting March 18, services will still be available. Among other options, people can call in with requests--the outsides of those materials being disinfected before they are put in a paper bag and left in the rear entryway of the building for pick up.
 On the horizon for the Village of Essex Junction is its annual meeting slated for April 1. Board of Trustees President Andrew Brown said that the village will not hold its dinner, and the board is exploring what it can do about the actual meeting.
 “We are consulting with our attorney and the Secretary of State’s office as we must hold an annual meeting and we must have a budget passed by the voters before June 30, 2020,” Brown said in a Monday email to the Reporter. “Because our charter specifies the budget must be voted on at annual meeting, we are exploring what legal options exist.”
 Brown also noted that officials made the decision to close the Essex Area Senior Center until further notice to keep the senior population safe and healthy. The Essex Senior Van is also being limited to grocery shopping, well visits to medical offices, and prescription pick-ups from pharmacies as long as the passenger has been symptom free from coughs, colds, flu, fever, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing for the past 14 days.
 Additional measures include closing off the Essex Rec building at 75 Maple Street to the public and cancelling Village Kids childcare and after-school care as of March 18.
 “I am thankful for the professionalism and expertise that our staff has and their regular contact with the Vermont Department of Health, Vermont League of Cities and Towns, neighboring communities and other sources of credible information,” Brown’s email added. “At the core of any municipality is to do what is best for the safety of our community and we take this responsibility seriously.”
 As some restaurants close their doors, a pair are going in the opposite direction. MARK BBQ and Heart n Soul are usually open Thursday through Saturday, but they decided to get cooking a day early this week and open on Wednesday to provide a free meal for anyone with food insecurities--offering grilled chicken, vegetables, and mashed potatoes or penne with marinara or meat sauce.
 “Our commitment to our community has never fallen short, and it's not going to fall short now,” said owner Darrell Langworthy in a video posted on MARK BBQ’s Facebook page. “It's time for us to step up, and we're going to do just that… This isn't like hoarding toilet paper, people. We need to take care of those that really need it. We need to do what we can for our communities.”
 On March 12, Essex Unified Manager Evan Teich and Essex Police Chief Rick Garey posted the town and village’s municipal response to the state of affairs.
 “This situation is changing every day,” the statement said, in part. “Municipal staff are not experts on the Coronavirus and so we are monitoring and following the Vermont Department of Health and CDC recommendations and guidelines for safe operation of our municipal functions and services. In order to make sure the best and most up to date information is being used/delivered, we are referring staff and the public to the VT Department of Health and CDC webpages which are updated daily. We are referring calls from the public about this topic to 211 or recommending they call their doctor. Emergency Services (police, fire & rescue) will continue to meet as needed to discuss potential updates to procedures to insure the continued delivery of all emergency services to our communities.”

Some might argue that most states do not have enough test kits, so if you are young and healthy you should just stay home to avoid overwhelming the system. Such individualizing logic, however, laying all the responsibility on the individual to "not overwhelm the system" is part of the problem. South Korea has tested over 250,000 people, and such a heavy-testing approach has been viewed as one of the best ways to get a grip on the spread of the virus.

Reports have UEFA considering pushing EURO 2020 to next summer to give the domestic leagues and the European club competitions time to finish their seasons. Whether or not that creates enough of a window is the question, with experts now pointing to a longer period of social distancing to lessen the spread of the virus. That would mean playing behind closed doors or continuing to postpone games. Professional soccer players and team personnel in Europe contracting the virus adds further constraints to UEFA's planning. All of this downplays the economic impact for all involved across Europe.

A FEDERAL man who broke his neck after he crashed and rolled his car in February has faced court on several charges.
 Joel Kenneth Pike, 32, pleaded guilty n Noosa Magistrates Court on Tuesday to driving under the influence and failing to provide a specimen for testing.
 A court heard Pike, who fronted the court wearing a neck brace, crashed and rolled his Jeep Cherokee several time on Cooroy Noosa Rd about 10.30pm on February 7.
 Queensland Ambulance were called to the scene where they found Pike unsteady, with blood shot eyes and the smell of liquor on his breath.
 He was transported to Sunshine Coast University Hospital where he then refused to allow a registered nurse to take a blood sample upon police request.
 The tradesman and soon-to-be father continued to refuse the order.
 He underwent surgery to fuse the bones in his neck together.
 Magistrate Haydn Stjernqvist said Pike’s actions were “serious”
 “This was a very serious incident of driving under the influence, failing to abide by a request by a nurse to give a bloods sample obviously with police there,” he said.
 “You were the only one in the vehicle and are here to tell the story.”
 Pike, who has already been suspended from driving for five weeks since the incident, was fined $1300 and disqualified from driving for 15 months. Convictions were recorded.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started stamping the hands of those advised to undergo home quarantine for Covid-19 to prevent them from mingling in public.
 As on March 15, 528 persons had been advised self-quarantine. These are people who do not have any symptoms of coronavirus but have recently returned from a foreign country. They are supposed to self-quarantine or home quarantine for 14 days, wherein BMC will monitor their symptoms.
 Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Monday that this decision had been taken to instil a sense of responsibility among them.
 Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday, “If such people go out, they will be identified as home quarantined. This is being done so that patients strictly follow self-quarantine.”
 From Monday onwards, BMC started putting a stamp on the back of their left hands stating, “Proud to protect Mumbaikars. Home quarantined.” The stamp is made of indelible ink similar to the one used to mark voters and the stamp also has a date until which the person is supposed to be quarantined.
 BMC has also issued detailed guidelines for those undergoing home quarantine.

 Germanotta said at the time that he had no intention to pay.
 "They're really not in the real estate business. They're in the train business," Germanotta said of the MTA.
 He said that he expected large crowds when he opened his fried chicken establishment in 2018 in the well-known train station. But customers were scared off by conditions ranging from an alleged rodent problem to dirty restrooms, he said.
 Germanotta claims to have laid off seven people as a result of the loss of business.

I decided that the best course of action was to stay home. On Saturday morning, March 14, I received a call from Telehealth. After another phone assessment, the nurse recommended that I go straight to the emergency room. I was back in panic mode; if I weren't pregnant, I could have simply stayed home. I proceeded to the ER, where the process was fairly quick. All suspected COVID-19 patients were contained on a separate hallway and were asked to sit at least one metre apart. Nurses and physicians were wearing full protective body suits. I finally got tested. The physician was confident that, due to no community transmission, and the fact that the incubation period is no more than 14 days and my symptoms started on day 15, I probably did not have COVID-19, but just a regular cold. Normally, I would not be tested, but since I am pregnant, they did the test.

Carotid artery stenting is used to open a narrowed carotid artery in the heart. Stenting helps in preventing a stroke in the long term, whereas it increases the risk of stroke and death in a short time.

Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque announced Monday the creation of the COVID-19 Response Fund.
 It will “provide flexible resources to organizations working with communities who are disproportionately impacted by coronavirus and the economic consequences of the outbreak,” a press release states.
 The fund was created in partnership with United Way of Dubuque Area Tri-States and other organizations, including Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, American Red Cross of Northeast Iowa, UnityPoint Health Visiting Nurse Association, Dubuque County Emergency Management and Operation: New View Community Action Agency.
 “We anticipate that low- income families and seniors on fixed incomes who struggle to make ends meet will be the hardest hit by the pandemic,” said Nancy Van Milligen, president and CEO of Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque, in the release. “More individuals will experience food insecurity, and more will struggle to pay their housing, child care and transportation costs.”
 The foundation’s board of directors and Women’s Giving Circle immediately committed $50,000 to the fund.

Bernie Sanders is going to win the upcoming election for the Democrats.
 Does that sound like crazy talk?
 In light of Sanders’ recent crushing defeats on the primary campaign trail, maybe it does sound crazy. Add to that the heavy blanket of pandemic related restrictions hovering over the political landscape and preventing the rallies that Sanders might have used to resurrect his faltering campaign. That pandemic blanket snuffs out whatever slim chances he had to win the nomination.
 Would it be even crazier to say that Sanders will win the election for Democrats by mobilizing young people to vote Democratic?
 If you are one of those Democrats who celebrated Biden’s recent rout of Sanders, you will probably rush to tell me that the legions of youthful Sanders supporters just did not show up to vote for him in the recent primaries.
 You might cite the figures given by Jamelle Bouie in a column last week in The New York Times. He wrote, “Young voters want Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee for president. But they don’t seem to want to turn out for him, or at least not in the numbers he needs to win.”
 In Michigan, for instance, although the youngest (18 to 29 year-old) voters gave most of their support to Sanders, they made up only 16 percent of the total voters. They were overwhelmed by the oldest voters, who were 20 percent of the electorate and gave most of their votes to Joe Biden.”
 Voters in the 30 to 44 year-old group supported Sanders, 52 percent to 42 percent. “But they were swamped, in turn, by the next oldest group (age 45 to 64) who backed Biden 62 percent to 26 percent.”
 In Missouri, Bouie reports, “14 percent of voters were under 30 versus 31 percent over 65. Sanders won the youngest voters with 70 percent of their vote. But that was no match for Biden’s 81 percent victory among retirement- age Democrats.”

In 1839, Missouri and Iowa Territory found themselves in a border dispute over the northern border of Missouri and the southern border of the Iowa Territory. Both sides claimed the same nine-and-a-half mile strip of land.
   
 Colonel John C. Sullivan surveyed Missouri's northern border in 1816 which became known as the Sullivan line. A description of this line was in Missouri's constitution, "the northern border of the state began at rapids on the Des Moines River."
   
 Because of multiple Indian treaties, and the giving and taking of tribal lands, another survey was done in 1837 by Joseph C. Brown who followed the description as stated in the constitution. But the rapids used in the Sullivan survey were not the same rapids used in the Brown survey. In 1838, the Missouri legislature declared this new survey the northern border of Missouri even though it contained almost 2,600 square miles more land. This was the land that was claimed by Iowa.
   
 When Missouri and Iowa almost went to war over ownership of this strip of land, both sides were willing to allow the US Supreme Court to settle the dispute.
   
 State of Missouri v. State of Iowa was heard by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney and eight associate justices in 1849. Associate Justice John Catron delivered the unanimous opinion.
   
 That decision was based on several factors. The Court wanted to know to what degree the Sullivan Line had been used in the past. It was found that over 15 Indian treaties had recognized the Sullivan Line. Federal and territorial land agencies, as well as Missouri land sales agents, had all used the Sullivan Line as Missouri's northern border. And it was noted that the US had respected the Sullivan Line in establishing the borders of the various territories north of Missouri.
   
 A second factor involved locating the "rapids of the Des Moines River." Brown's survey mentioned ripples, falls, and shoals, but no rapids.
   
 When Missouri's constitution was reviewed, they found reference to the Sullivan Line and the rapids on the Des Moines River."
   
 The Court held that Missouri's northern border was the 1816 Sullivan Line and the strip of land in question was actually the southern border of Iowa.

Bernie tends to believe that only his vision of reality counts, and whether or not he can be successful in promoting that vision is secondary. From Bernie’s perspective, it’s only fighting the good fight that counts, and the good fight is an end in itself. That's fanaticism. That's why he's been so isolated over the years in congress, and so ineffective. He’s a “pie in the sky” kind of guy. But life doesn’t work that way - it’s fighting the _WINNING_ fight that counts. Life is not about all or nothing; life is about achieving your goals incrementally and gradually moving towards your ultimate objective. If Bernie hasn’t learned that simple lesson in life at his age, he’s not equipped to be president. That's the way Trump thinks. So while, unlike Trump, Bernie's heart may be in the right place, his mind is lagging far behind.

It is easy to imagine a year from now, once hopefully the coronavirus pandemic has been dealt with either through containment or vaccines, the market rallying hard, pushing aside the "lost quarter" it experienced and things returning to normal - or even perhaps better than normal as all the folks quarantined, social distancing, and locked in want to enjoy and be active in the world again and do so with reinvigorated force.
 ## It Still Will Be Volatile, But Hopefully You've Been Desensitized
 In the meantime, I expect that the market will decline in the short run because of how these new, particularly economically destructive measures, are being rolled out to combat coronavirus and how they seem to be spreading fast. However, in the most ideal scenario, this means that coronavirus could be contained mostly in just eight weeks in the United States, according to the CDC in guidance encouraging social distancing. In more realistic scenarios, it could take well into the summer, according to the President in a press conference on Monday afternoon, or in worse cases far longer.
 Yet, the world isn't ending, and someday the market will be back. There are good buying opportunities out there now in sectors - such as technology (XLK) - that have ample cash flow liquidity, good balance sheets, and are not the sectors experiencing the greatest declines in business, whether short term or long term. With Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOG) each having over a hundred billion dollars of just plain old cash sitting around, it is hard to imagine them having liquidity issues, and there are many other companies similarly well-capitalized.
 Find the good buys out there, don't over-leverage, hold, be ready for lots more pain, don't call a bottom, and sell high. All simple investing wisdom tidbits, but sometimes really easier said than done - particularly in times like these.

NORTH ATTLEBOROUGH -- While the town's schools are closed amidst the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, the district's nutrition department is continuing to provide free meals to all children under the age of 18 on a "drive through," pick-up basis.
 Distribution will be done weekdays at Community School, 45 S. Washington St., 11 a.m.-1 p.m., for all students in need of meals.
 "It is an integral part of our mission to ensure that our students continue to have access to balanced meals in order to maintain their health and the health of our entire community. As you can imagine, this will look quite different from the way we serve meals during the school year," the North Attleborough School Nutrition Team stated in an announcement posted on the school district's website on Saturday.
 The "drive-through, grab and go style meal service" will start on March 17 and will be held at front of the school.
 "Meals will be pre-assembled and prepackaged into bags or covered containers and set up on tables outside the front of the school to be taken off site," the team said. "Breakfast and lunch will be served together."
 No registration, ID, address or name is needed.
 "Each student will be given a meal no questions asked," the team stated. "All meals are free and you may stop by anytime during the service hours."
 The nutrition team noted that precautions will be taken to ensure the safety of all staff, students and their families.      "Kitchens and serving tables will be routinely sanitized, utensils will be prepackaged in plastic, gloves will be worn by staff and changed frequently, and staff will also frequently wash their hands throughout service," the team assures community members.
 Anyone feeling ill, including children, is asked to "refrain from attending meal service."
 Because of the "nature" of the meal service and product availability, the team noted it will not always be able to accommodate allergies and "parents/guardians assume responsibility for their children's allergies."

Now, when it comes to gender, how is this not the same business as usual that Professor Taylor spoke about? Joe Biden is giving an unequivocal break with the past. Only two women, Geraldine Ferraro in '84 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, have been on a national ticket — and, of course, Sarah Palin in running with John McCain. So the reality is, is that, in a sense, Bernie Sanders' inability to grapple with the existential dilemmas introduced by the "scourge" of identity politics has been one of the banes of his political existence, that at the end of the day, when the revolution he wants to imagine occurs, it seems to place an unrestricted embrace of an undifferentiated class above issues of gender and race and the like. And what ends up happening is that gender exacerbates class. Race exacerbates class. So, yes, you want to find a woman who is in ideological sympatico with you. There's no question about that. But why not presume — why presume that only a man would fill that spot? Why —

In May, FOX5 highlighted their Digimart, a grocery style pickup service for pantry items. But amid coronavirus concerns, they’ve had to ditch that.
 “We know that these meals are essential to our lives and the other people’s lives we eat with, but we also want to be safe,” Hightower said.
 Many of their clients depended on the in-house kiosk to place orders, but now they’ve moved everything outdoors and are handing out emergency boxes with one of every item instead to minimize person to person contact.
 Lutheran Social Services has also had to revamp the way they help vulnerable seniors right now.
 “At one of our meal programs that usually feeds about 50 seniors a day we are only bringing them in ten at a time, we’re having them sit farther apart, they have a certain set amount of time to eat,” Hightower said. “Then, they can leave the dining hall, we sanitize it, then the next ten can come in.”
 Some of their senior clients get home visits from a case worker who checks in to make sure they have everything they need. Now, that’s shifted to phone calls and very careful deliveries with no face to face contact.
 “She will deliver food to their houses,” Hightower said. “But she’ll put it in bags that a senior can lift if they can’t lift a whole emergency box.”

And in November 2018, the Council of Europe's human rights commissioner called on Greece to investigate allegations of Greek abuses at Turkey's border, in light of information pointing to "an established practice."
