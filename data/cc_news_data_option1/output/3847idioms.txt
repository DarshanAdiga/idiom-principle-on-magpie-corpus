First up, one of the key props in one of the most famous scenes in cinema history has had a long journey through the hands of collectors. Vanity Fair tracked the path of the axe Jack Nicholson wielded in _The Shining_ , which eventually sold at an auction for over $200,000. But it's the trip the axe took in between that's fun to follow along with.

Dando continuidad a su plan de tareas, la Dirección de Gestión Ambiental de la comuna capitalina procedió, durante la jornada del viernes 25, a la recuperación y embellecimiento de un nuevo espacio ubicado en la intersección de las calles Juan Manuel de Rosas y Arenales, en el barrio Parque Urbano.                                        Al respecto, el responsable del área municipal, Julio Vargas, precisó que en ese lugar, como parte del Plan Bio, se realizaron trabajos de erradicación de microbasurales, saneamiento, cercado, plantación de especies arbóreas y colocación de cartelería para concientizar a los vecinos sobre los riesgos que genera arrojar basura en lugares no permitidos.                                        “Nos encontramos con un lugar donde se generaba un microbasural que preocupaba a vecinas y vecinos y por ese motivo solicitaron nuestra intervención, que consistió en la limpieza integral, recuperación y embellecimiento de un amplio espacio público y, además, les informamos sobre los horarios en los que deben sacar los residuos domiciliarios para evitar la formación de microbasurales”, comentó el funcionario.                                        Al mismo tiempo, Vargas señaló que “los vecinos mostraron su satisfacción por las tareas que lleva adelante la comuna en materia de higiene urbana y se comprometieron a trabajar juntos para mantener la limpieza del sector”.                                        “Estas acciones ponen de manifiesto el gran compromiso de la gestión del intendente Jorge Jofré por lograr una ciudad limpia, ordenada y saludable, y para cumplir con ese objetivo todas las áreas de la Secretaría de Servicios Públicos trabajan de manera permanente en la recolección de residuos convencionales y no convencionales, erradicando, además, microbasurales en todos los barrios del ejido urbano”, remarcó Vargas.                                        Asimismo, indicó que en el barrio La Nueva Formosa prosiguen las acciones conjuntas y coordinadas que realizan el Municipio, el Ministerio de Desarrollo Humano y la Policía provincial en el marco del plan integral de erradicación del dengue.                                        Por último, resaltó: “Este es un Municipio de puertas abiertas, que se muestra cercano a los vecinos para resolver sus inquietudes y mejorar la calidad de vida de todos ellos y por cualquier solicitud o reclamo se pueden comunicar con el Centro de Atención al Vecino (0800-9999-147) para que las diferentes áreas comunales se aboquen a atender y brindar rápidas respuestas a los pedidos recepcionados”.

Gabe DiSaverio calls himself a "Jaws nut."
   
 He's into anyone, or anything that has any connection to the 1975 killer-shark blockbuster movie "Jaws." The obsession has infiltrated all facets of his life.
   
 DiSaverio's vacations have been Jaws themed, his business and conservation efforts revolve around sharks, and his daughter's middle name is Ellen, after Jaws character Police Chief Martin Brody's wife.
   
 "I'm pretty sure I can scientifically prove it's the greatest movie ever made," he said.
   
 Part of his Jaws fandom includes a 15-year search for a 1975 Chevy Blazer, like the one Chief Brody drove in the movie. While business lagged during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Portsmouth resident scoured the internet, saw one up for auction, maybe in his price range, so he asked his wife, Jill Fratianne, what she thought.
   
 "She said, 'You work eight days a week, you've never bought a toy for yourself and you've been talking about this since our third date,'" he recalled.
   
 It was the green light he needed and during a live auction for the K5 Cheyenne, he was the highest bidder. When he won, DiSaverio said, "I was literally shaking."
   
 Owner of The Spicy Shark hot sauce company, DiSaverio said when he first saw the movie Jaws he was 8-years-old and, "I was just captivated."
   
 When he moved to Boston in 1997, his favorite vacation spot became Martha's Vineyard, the setting for the movie's fictitious Amity Island. He said he was a regular on "Jaws tours," took photos from every location in the movie and, "I may have even re-enacted some of my favorite scenes when no one was looking."
   
 He describes his first JawsFest on the Vineyard in 2012 as, "a life-changing event," where he met some of the film's living actors and others involved in the filmmaking. He met Wendy Benchley, widow of Jaws author Peter Benchley, which led to his involvement in shark conservation. It's a passion he supports by donating a portion of the proceeds from his hot sauces for advocacy to end the shark fin trade.
   
 When DiSaverio brought his Spicy Shark hot sauces to market at "Shark-Con" in Florida last year, he said, "I was in heaven."
   
 "I spent more money than I made and loved every minute," he said.
   
 Highlights there included meeting Alex Kitner, who played a boy on a raft in the movie Jaws and Chrissy Watkins, a girl in the opening scene.
   
 All the while, DiSaverio obsessed about a 1975 Blazer. He said he checked the internet every few months to see if one was for sale "anywhere in the country." In July, during the 45th anniversary of Jaws, he bought his vintage Blazer from a North Carolina owner.
   
 Unable to afford the cost of having it shipped to him, he flew south to "get my new baby" and drove it back to Portsmouth. He calls the Blazer "Martin," Chief Brody's first name.
   
 "But you can call him Marty," he said.
   
 DiSaverio found three other people to help him remove the hard top. The roll bar was painted black and back panel painted white at Ben's Auto Body, to match the movie rig.
   
 Replica hubcaps were found online and he added non-working cherry lights on the roll bar. The cherry lights, he said, were "absolutely critical."
   
 He ordered vanity "AMITY" license plates and, on Thursday, had custom "Amity Police Dept" stickers, from Hampton's Sticker Cabana, adhered to the doors.
   
 "There are two or three others (replica Jaws Blazers) out there, but they don't have the right lettering," he said. "You gotta have the exact font."
   
 While driving through the center of Portsmouth last week, two beat officers turned their heads as he went past, one shouting, "Jaws!"
   
 "I get a lot of honks and fists in the air," he said. "Everyone who turns their head has a big smile on their face."
   
 DiSaverio said the Blazer will be his summer ride, to bring smiles to faces, then stored during New Hampshire winters. It will also be his "company car," with his Spicy Shark brand on the back, to promote his hot sauces he rates by one to six shark fins to indicate heat.
   
 He also considers the Jaws replica Blazer a part of his family.
   
 "I have a daughter," he said. "This is my son."

The case of the missing COVID-19 case at Walpole North Elementary School, near Hagersville, has been explained.                                                                            Announced on Sept. 13 by the Grand Erie District School Board, the case was described as "a person in our school community" who tested positive for the virus but no information about a case at Walpole North appeared on a Ministry of Education's website tracking such cases. The discrepancy raised questions on social media.                                                                            The Expositor has learned from a provincial source that the school sent a cohort of students and staff home due to a probable case, which was not reported by the Ministry of Education or by the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit since it was not a lab-confirmed case.                                                                            "The parents of a child got sick, got tested for COVID-19 and tested positive," said the source, who asked not to be identified. "The child then got sick as well, but the parents did not want to subject their child to the test."                                                                            Because the child was ill and in proximity to at least one confirmed case, the student's case was deemed probable but the school and board responded as if it were a definite case.                                                                            That situation has been confirmed by a parent of a child within the affected cohort.                                                                            The problem, according to a Brantford-born statistician who has been tracking COVID-19 data in Ontario, is that cases that don't fit into a trackable category have the ability to skew the statistics.                                                                            "The Ministry of Health guidelines don't have a category for this," said Ryan Imgrund, who is a bio-statistician and head of science at a Newmarket, Ont., high school.                                                                            "It's not a pending case, not a positive or negative case."                                                                            Imgrund said he fully supports the decision made by the school and board to close the cohort but rules were not followed.                                                                            "You send a cohort home if a child tests positive. In this case, they're acting as if the child was positive but it's then not reported (in the data) as positive. We may be missing many cases because of that."                                                                            Indeed, the provincial source said "a lot of parents don't want to have their kids wait in long lines for tests or subject them to having a long swab put up their nose."                                                                            The source noted that not all health units track probable cases because of different standards, so they aren't reported by the ministry.                                                                            "If they reported all probable cases, their statistics wouldn't be accurate because of the varying definition of 'probable'."                                                                            Imgrund said he worries that cases like the North Walpole one  lead to "weird optics" for the public where they see a school cohort shut down but no relating records on the ministry website.                                                                            "I hope this is a learning experience for the Ministry of Health. There should be a 'probable' category to report any case where a cohort was sent home."

The Philadelphia Eagles will host the Cincinnati Bengals in a critical early season game on Sunday, Sept. 27 at 1 p.m. (CBS3). The Eagles (0-2) really can’t afford another loss at this point in the season.                                                                                    The team has really struggled over the first two weeks of the season. The Bengals (0-2) are looking for their first win as well.                                                                                    In order for the Eagles to get their first win of the season, they’re going to need some great performances from some of their veteran players. Of course, Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz is off to a slow start completing 50-of-85 passes for 512 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions. The Eagles could help Wentz by leaning more on the running game with Miles Sanders who had 20 carries for 95 yards and one TD against the Los Angeles Rams. A solid ground attack could help Wentz with keeping the offense moving. In addition, Sanders has big play potential with his speed.

SPRINGFIELD - While Illinois' rolling average COVID-19 positivity rates remain lower than surrounding states, Gov. JB Pritzker said once again Wednesday it is still too high to resume a level of normalcy beyond mitigations currently in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                               The rolling seven-day average positivity rate in the state remained at 3.5 percent Wednesday for the fifth straight day, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, which reported another 1,848 new cases of the virus among 46,391 test results reported over the previous 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                               "I would love it if we could get below 2 percent, that would be terrific," Pritzker said. "We're not anywhere near that right now. And what has happened is that Illinois, even though we've got the best positivity rate among all of our neighboring states, it's still a concerning positivity rate."                                                                                                                                                                                                               The governor once again said unequivocally he is listening to medical experts when it comes to allowing fall sports with a high risk of transmission. The expert recommendations are to not allow contact sports such as wrestling and football at this time. Sports such as football and volleyball have been tentatively rescheduled for the spring.                                                                                                                                                                                                               As for schooling, the state has let local school districts decide the best method for engaging students.                                                                                                                                                                                                               "Our schools are a priority, we want to make sure that kids are back in school," Pritzker said. "There are many kids who are in hybrid programs, and many kids who are not at all in school, they're just in e-learning. And the further we can drive this positivity rate down, the more I'm looking forward to the idea that kids will be able to get back in school."                                                                                                                                                                                                               Pritzker also noted that Region 1 of the state's reopening plan, which includes Rockford in Winnebago County and several surrounding counties in northwest Illinois, has seen its positivity rate rise to 7.5 percent. That's higher than Region 4, which includes the Metro East area along the Missouri border near St. Louis, which currently sits at 7.3 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                               If Region 1 sees the rate rise above 8 percent for three straight days, it would be in line for added mitigations, such as closing of bars and restaurants to indoor drinking and dining. Region 4 will have stricter mitigations removed if it falls below 6.5 percent for three straight days.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Pritzker said the state has reached out to county health officials in Region 1 to "discuss preventative measures that can be taken at the local level to avoid additional mitigations in their communities."                                                                                                                                                                                                               Other regions ranged from 2.6 percent in east-central Illinois to 6 percent in southern Illinois.                                                                                                                                                                                                               IDPH also announced another 22 COVID-19-related deaths, pushing confirmed virus-related casualties to 8,508. There have now been 279,114 confirmed cases of the virus among more than 5.2 million test results reported. The recovery rate for those 42 days removed from a positive diagnosis is 96 percent, according to IDPH.                                                                                                                                                                                                               "Some people have become a bit numb to the numbers but I want to remind people that COVID-19 can have severe consequences," IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said. "Definitely in the short run, and to be seen in the long run."                                                                                                                                                                                                               Ezike once again urged all Illinoisans to wear a face covering, keep six feet apart from others, wash hands and get a flu vaccine to guard against illness.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Nationally, the death toll exceeds 200,000, which Pritzker called an "unimaginable number." He said as the death toll rises, so does the number of people affected by the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                               "And so unfortunately, as the numbers grow, maybe people aren't focusing as much on the how big that number is. But they are focusing on the fact that they know somebody in their community who suffered from (the virus)," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Hospitalization numbers in the state remained roughly level above their pandemic lows. At the end of Tuesday, there were 1,563 persons in Illinois reported hospitalized with COVID-19, including 351 in intensive care units and 144 patients on ventilators.

Disney also previously had a standalone Tinker Bell movie in the works that Reese Witherspoon and Margot Robbie were rumored to be attached to at different points. Witherspoon was announced to star in the film titled _Tink_ in 2015. It doesn’t seem like that project is in the works anymore, but perhaps if  Yara Shahidi makes an impression, we could see her continue past _Peter Pan and Wendy_.

WEST CARROLLTON, Ohio (WDTN) - West Carrollton School District is asking taxpayers to approve an extension on their operating levy in November's election. The request will be referenced as Issue #17 on the ballot and will renew the 5.5 mill levy initially approved in 2016. The school district says voting to approve the issue will mean no new taxes for residents.

The teenager, who was "showing signs of hypothermia and exhaustion and was suffering from the effects of shock", was given first aid on board.

Where a claim of personal injury or death is made that is based upon exposure to COVID-19 within an association's common elements, a court will review the then-current health standards and the association's conduct, and then determine whether the immunity of SB4 shall apply. Since most insurers are likely to deny coverage for such a claim, associations would be required to pay their own defense costs out of pocket. You would need to contact your insurance company to determine their position as to defending your association, knowing that SB4 could act as a limited shield in any lawsuit.

Boards have inquired whether specific amenities (e.g., the pool, clubhouse, playgrounds, gym and basketball courts) may be reopened in light of the passage of SB4. As described above, the answer to this question is based upon the association's willingness to establish a reopening plan which comports with current (and evolving health standards) and thereafter, to enforce the same. Many associations have reopened their pools, clubhouses and gyms. Some have reopened playgrounds and basketball courts. Very few allow such amenities to be used by guests.

I, like many others, was horrified by the way these little girls had to act.

Survivors include sons, Samuel M. Browder, Jr. and wife, Nancy of Stuart, Florida; Joe H. Browder II and wife, Mary Beth of Knoxville, Tennessee; and John F.

Great grandchildren, Caroline and Alexandra Chaffee of Falls Church, Virginia.                                                                                       Born just before the Great Depression and coming of age during World War II, Sam grew up quickly and to enlisted in the Navy at the age of only 17. He bravely served in the Pacific Theater during WWII. Following the war, Sam found himself stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, where he was lucky enough to meet the absolute love of his life, Lynn Matthes. Knowing that he had found the woman with whom he would spend his life, Sam returned to Tennessee, where he was shortly joined by Lynn, so they could both complete their undergraduate education at UT and begin their lives together.                                                                                       Sam had an active and colorful career at UT, where he and his best friend (and soon-to-be best man), Howard Baker were both brothers of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Majoring in business, Sam spent his college years honing his skills and making lifelong friends. Sam and Lynn were married in 1950 and they soon began their family. At that time Sam also joined the family business, Harriman Oil Company. Under Sam's industrious leadership, the company grew to become one of the largest Shell Oil distributors in the country. Sam was also engaged in an array of other industries, including banking, automotive dealerships, real estate, and commercial development. He was a staunch believer in the value of education and enthusiastically supported UT. He was also instrumental in the founding of Roane State Community College. Always one for adventure, Sam held his pilot's license for over fifty years and was an avid fisherman and outdoorsman.                                                                                       Sam and Lynn were inseparable during their almost fifty-six years of marriage. They travelled extensively. They enjoyed weekly rounds of golf together, along with an active social and family life. Sam remained a member of St John's Episcopal Cathedral.                                                                                       Sam was forever proud of raising four Eagle Scouts and watching his sons grow up and have families of their own. He was a wonderful, devoted husband and a beloved father and grandfather. He loved a perfectly prepared, rare steak, attending Tennessee football games, and taking his grandchildren to breakfast on Saturday mornings. His last years were quiet ones spent at home, where he adored frequent visits from family and friends.                                                                                       The Browder family would like to thank the dedicated caregivers who were such a part of his life in later years: Carolyn, Irvin, Peggy, Lisa, Alan, Mary and others who made his life more enjoyable.                                                                                       Due to the complicated current times, the immediate family will will gather for a memorial service.

“This year more than any other, there’s a lot of gray area about what could happen to your vote,” said Harman, who said she didn’t question voting by mail in 2016 when she was out of town.
 Traditionally, voting by mail has not been a partisan issue. Until recently, Republicans were more likely to do so than Democrats, because older voters have tended to vote by mail more often than younger voters.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended earlier this year voting by mail as an alternative to face-to-face interactions at polling places, which could pose a risk of coronavirus infection. States have scrambled to adjust to an expected surge in advance voting, with nearly three dozen changing their mail or absentee voting rules in response to the pandemic.
 Studies of past elections have shown voter fraud to be exceedingly rare. In the five states that regularly send ballots to all voters, there have been no major cases of fraud or difficulty counting the votes.
 The poll found that 33% of Democrats, but just 12% of Republicans, favor mail- only elections. That’s a decline across the board from April, when 47% of Democrats and 29% of Republicans backed the idea. Seventy-two percent of Democrats, but just 25% of Republicans, favor no-excuse absentee voting.
 In swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, Democrats have far outpaced Republicans in requesting mail-in ballots so far this year.
 The poll shows only 34% of Americans have great confidence in the U.S. Postal Service, following a summer of controversy over slowed service. Still, 49% say they have some confidence.

I'm good morning Diana that's exactly what authorities are trying to investigate right now this moment this morning was terrifying in central Paris we know that. Two people were brutally intact in front of their office building right outside. The former offices of Charlie had to those two people. A man and a woman at work for the publication premier Nina none spoke with their editor in chief and he tells us that. The journalists had just stepped outside to take a break when they were attacked by an eighteen year old man was something. That looked like potentially a butcher's cleaver or even an axed. Now he says that that eighteen year old been strengths of the woman in the face before trying to hit the man in the neck but the man was able to defend himself. It was then that someone from another office building came over with able to chase the attacker a way to the metro and that is where police finally detained him. Now Dan is still too early in the investigation. To tell any facts for sure but authorities did make a point to say that anti terror police is now investigating. Because the attack took place so close to the former offices of that the Terry magazine turley had Dow ended the attacker had a clear intent to kill people.

The package of monetary and fiscal measures which we adopted in full coordination with the Serbian Government is yielding results, and the majority of key indicators are well on the path to reaching pre-crisis levels. Serbia is one of the countries that were the first to respond with a comprehensive package of measures, whereby we managed to prevent a sharp fall in business and consumer confidence, and preserve jobs and production capacities necessary for fast economic recovery. This is affirmed by the FDI inflow which, despite the pandemic, amounted to EUR 1.6 bn in seven months, as well as by the fact that in the first half of the year, in terms of GDP, we had the best result in the region and one of the best in the whole of Europe', said the Governor.

CNN) — President Donald Trump intends to choose Amy Coney Barrett to be the new Supreme Court justice, according to multiple senior Republican sources with knowledge of the process.                                                                  In conversations with some senior Republican allies on the Hill, the White House is indicating that Barrett is the intended nominee, multiple sources said.                                                                  All sources cautioned that until it is announced by the President, there is always the possibility that Trump makes a last-minute change but the expectation is Barrett is the choice. He is scheduled to make the announcement on Saturday afternoon.                                                                  Barrett has been the leading choice throughout the week, since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. She is the only potential nominee known to have met with the President in person, according to two of the sources. One source said Trump was familiar with Barrett already and he met with her since she was a top contender the last time there was a Supreme Court vacancy, when the President chose Justice Brett Kavanaugh instead.                                                                  Barrett was seen at her South Bend, Indiana, home on Friday. It was not clear if Barrett had been told she is the choice. Often that is done as late as possible to maintain secrecy around the announcement.                                                                  "The machinery is in motion," one of the sources said. In previous nomination announcements, the White House had multiple rollouts planned in case the President made a last-minute decision to switch to another candidate. But one source said it would be surprising if there were a change since allies are already being told.                                                                  The White House declined to comment.                                                                  "She was the plan all along. She's the most distinguished and qualified by traditional measures. She has the strongest support among the legal conservatives who have dedicated their lives to the court. She will contribute most to the court's jurisprudence in the years and decades to come," according to a former senior administration official familiar with the process.                                                                  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear in conversations with Trump and White House counsel Pat Cipollone that the Senate GOP conference would be comfortable with Barrett, two people with knowledge of the conversations told CNN earlier this week. Sen. Todd Young, who hails from Barrett's home state of Indiana and leads the Senate Republican campaign arm, has also been an advocate, the people said.                                                                  The President indicated he has spoken to multiple candidates, but the White House has not been willing to say if other conversations were in person.                                                                  Barrett was at the White House on Monday and Tuesday of this week. She impressed the President and others during the initial meetings, two sources told CNN earlier this week.

Tight end Darren Waller was unstoppable, hauling in 12 of his 16 targets for 101 yards and a TD. But 10 other Raiders also caught passes.

A military transport plane carrying aviation school students crashed and burst into flames in northeastern Ukraine on Friday, killing at least 22 people on board, officials said.                                                                                                                                                                         Rescue workers were on the scene. Air force pilots and cadets were on the plane, the Interior Ministry said.                                                                                                                                                                     At least two people were injured and taken to hospital in a serious condition, and the search continued for the others, Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko said.                                                                                                                                                                     The plane, an Antonov 26, crashed while attempting to land at the airport in Chuhuiv, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Kyiv and 2 kilometers from a military airport.

El aumento de la compra de electricidad a partir de fuentes renovables apoya los objetivos de sustentabilidad de Henkel en el 2040: la empresa planea reducir la huella de carbono en su producción un 65% para el 2025 y en un 75% para el 2030, considerando el 2010 como año base. Henkel tiene la intención de lograr esto a través del mejoramiento continuo de su eficiencia energética y utilizando electricidad de fuentes renovables. Para el 2030, el 100% de su electricidad provendrá de fuentes renovables y para el 2040 tiene como objetivo haber convertido todos los combustibles fósiles restantes utilizados en su producción en alternativas climáticamente neutrales y suministrar energía excedente neutra en carbono a terceros. Adicionalmente, Henkel desea aprovechar sus marcas y tecnologías para ayudar a los consumidores, clientes y proveedores a ahorrar 100 millones de CO2 en un periodo de diez años, hasta el 2025.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Jacksonville coach Doug Marrone might be done deferring.                                                                                  The Jaguars allowed a touchdown on the game's opening drive for the third straight week, leaving them in another hole before quarterback Gardner Minshew even stepped on the field. This one set the tone for a 31-13 loss to Miami on Thursday night.                                                                                  The Jags won the coin toss for the third consecutive outing, and Marrone opted to put his defense on the field first. It backfired again.                                                                                  Miami (1-2) marched 84 yards on 12 plays, taking a 7-0 lead on Ryan Fitzpatrick's touchdown pass to Preston Williams. The Dolphins scored touchdowns on their next two possessions, too, opening up a 21-7 lead that was too much for Jacksonville (1-2) to overcome in a 31-13 loss.

But the political pushback on this is going to be enormous. There’s no great groundswell among veterans for having their care privatized. Currently the Veterans Administration delivers care for a fraction of the cost of private insurance. The same is true for TriCare, the military’s healthcare program. Before any of these programs get up and running, Democrats may well be in charge and eager to roll those costs back.

The _Saturday Night Live_ library was first available for streaming was back in the early 2010s, when both Netflix and Hulu had as close to the full library as they could get at the time.

Finally, Syfy Wire takes a look back at the computer animated MTV production, _Spider-Man: The New Animated Series_.

Now Penso, whose husband Chris has been an MLS referee since 2009, is hoping to become a regular in MLS. She is currently in what is called PRO 2, a designation by the Professional Referees Organization -- which makes assignments in various leagues throughout North America -- for up and coming referees. Even during this COVID-impacted season, Penso has refereed five games in the NWSL as well as four in the USL Championship. She had also been the fourth official in three previous MLS games this season.                                                                                  "My hope is that I'm here to stay that this isn't a one and done," she said. "I hope is that assignments come through in the next couple weeks and 'Bing', I've got another one. That's my hope. And ultimately, I would love to be a full time referee, a bargaining unit member of the PRO group. There's never been a female to do that. So hopefully that's possible. You know, I'm hoping to make consistent performances. Prove that I'm the quality that they will hopefully want but I'm still trying to soak in the moment that just happened. I certainly looking up and hungry and ready for the next challenge ahead."                                                                                  Tori Penso became the first female head referee in an MLS game since 2000. Matthew Maxey/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images                                                                                  Penso got her start as a referee at age 14 as a way to make some extra money, and began taking it more seriously at age 18 when she went to an Olympic Development Program refereeing camp in Alabama. She was quick to credit the likes of those female referees that paved the way before her, including Hunt, Nancy Lay, and Kari Seitz. But she also was aware of what Wednesday's match meant in terms of increasing the chances of other female referees, of which there are currently 13 working their way through the PRO 2 pipeline.                                                                                  "I think there was a little extra weight on my shoulders heading into the game," she said. "I did my best to kind of brush that off and focus at the task at hand, and do all the due diligence I would normally do scouting the teams, preparing with my team and making sure that we were 100% focused for the game with minimal distractions as best as possible. There's always butterflies, right? You can prepare as best as you can mentally, physically, but at the end of the day, it's the next step up. And for me, it was a dream come true."                                                                                  Penso says she managed to keep her emotions in check beforehand, though she said she received the usual "pep talk" via text message from her husband, who was in New York serving as the VAR referee for the match between New York City FC and Toronto FC. Chris Penso told Tori, "You deserve to be there. You've earned this. You got this. You have all the skills it takes."                                                                                  It helped that she had been the fourth official for a previous encounter between the two teams earlier this season.                                                                                  "I was relatively familiar with the technical area staff, as well as the players," she said with regards to her preparation. "So just dove a little bit deeper, and then just kind of imagine what the matchup might look like, look into how they competed before. And then kind of visualize what do I expect based on their performances that prior weekend?"                                                                                  Afterwards Penso allowed her the magnitude of her achievement to sink in.                                                                                  "It was overwhelming I think, when I came off the pitch, when the duty was done and we served the game, and it wasn't about us, and we did a good job," she said. "I think that's when it all kind of hit me."                                                                                  On Monday, Penso will receive her full assessment of Wednesday's match from PRO, in which every decision will be dissected. But before then she has another game to referee, that being this weekend's NWSL encounter between the Chicago Red Stars and Sky Blue FC. She suspects her performance will be scrutinized closely.                                                                                  She said, "PRO is always watching these things. Always."

Over-the-top trends in hardwood floor colors are certainly striking. Deep grays, whitewashes, and brightly painted colors add a touch ... er ... bucketload of drama to your home - but will you still love them tomorrow? Which new hues can stand the test of time? And what are the best hardwood floor colors to install for resale?                                                                                      I recently interviewed Dan Natkin, Mannington Vice President, Hardwood and Laminate, and self-described "wood nerd." Here's Dan's expert advice on hardwood floor colors today.                                                                                      What are today's popular hardwood colors?                                           What we call "naturals" and "modified naturals" are the hottest hardwood floor colors. Tones have gotten a lot lighter. The gray trend began a few years ago, but the initial grays were very steely in color; today it's more natural, a very light and subtle color. At the same time, red tones have faded out of favor.                                                                                      There's another thing - gloss level. The higher the shine, the more it's going to show wear over time. The trend for the last 10, 15 years has been lower and lower gloss.                                                                                      What's a color profile that will always be in style?                                           Honey and butterscotch are timeless. I've been in the industry 20 years and that color family continues to be the No. 1 bestseller. It's a tone that allows you to redesign around it - not too dark, not too light. You can really accessorize it well.                                                                                      Should homeowners first choose flooring and design the room around it, or vice versa?                                           That's up to the individual. However, floor color affects the feeling of a room; a heavy dark floor tends to bring a room in and make it feel cozier. A lighter floor makes the room seem more open. So it depends what you're going for. Are you trying to create an intimate space or an open feeling?                                                                                      Do you recommend particular colors for different needs - say, empty nesters vs. families with young kids?                                           Generally, it's a matter of personal taste. If you've got a very active family, though, I'd stay away from the darkest tones. With really dark, almost black floors, if you get a little nick here or there, it's going to jump out like someone's shining a light on it. For an empty nester, that may be fine, but when you have kids and pets, the lighter to mid-tones are definitely the way to go.                                                                                      What would you recommend for resale?                                           Although there are so many options on the market that homeowners can really take some design risks, if you're looking forward to resale, don't                                            go too crazy. Stay in that traditional color palette - naturals and honeys. They tend to resell better than a floor that's got red, green, and blue all mixed up.                                                                                      Should kitchen floors be lighter or darker than cabinets?                                           That's an individual choice. But if your cabinets are white or off-white, a mid to darker floor serves as a nice complement. If your cabinets are very dark, let the floor be a little lighter to open up the space.                                                                                      What do you think about trends such as whitewashing or painting wood floors?                                           I've seen whitewashing come and go probably three times in my career already. As far as painting or other "out-there" colorations, I think you may get bored with it. Personal styles tend to change over time and that's one that kind of locks you in.                                                                                      Generally, I advise: "Design to the style of your home, your taste and what you're going to like living with. Just be careful not to go too extreme.                                           "Wood is not a floor covering, it's a flooring. There's a difference. When you have a floor covering - vinyl, for instance - you may change it out every 5-7 years. In wood, you're making a more permanent decision, so my recommendation is that you pick something that's going to stay in fashion for quite a while."                                                                                      Do you have a favorite floor color?                                           I'm a traditionalist. Muted colors with hints of gray are my favorite, though it depends on the setting. For example, I have two different types of wood in my house. I chose to install hand-scraped hickory flooring throughout the first floor because I had two young kids, a dog and a lot of foot traffic. But in my master bedroom, I have beautiful white oak, finished in light gray, with a super, super matte finish.

Mikel Arteta has tipped in-form Arsenal striker, Eddie Nketiah to earn an England callup.                                                                    Nketiah became a part of the Arsenal first-team set up in January after his loan spell at Leeds United was cut short.                                                                    He was expected to leave the Emirates for another loan spell, but he impressed Arteta in training and the Spaniard decided to keep him as a part of his first team.                                                                    The Englishman has repaid the faith with some fine performances. Scoring in consecutive games against West Ham and Leicester City ahead of Arsenal’s league game against Liverpool next week.                                                                    Speaking ahead of the game, the Spanish manager said that the striker, who has scored 12 goals in 10 under21 England matches will get his chance to play for the senior England national team if he keeps impressing like he is doing at the moment.                                                                    He is confident of that happening because of how Gareth Southgate’s team of coaches have trusted youngsters with chances.                                                                    Arteta said via Mail Online: ‘Obviously if he keeps performing in the way he has been with us in the last few months he will have a really good chance.                                                                    ‘I think culturally, England and the actual manager are really brave with young kids.                                                                    ‘It’s up to them, they have to be consistent and keep doing what they’re doing at club level and then that opportunity will come in a natural way.’

Jerick McKinnon is an option in PPR leagues, but the real sleeper is Jeff Wilson Jr.﻿, who's likely to lead San Francisco's backfield in touches, including at the goal line. Wilson is being mostly ignored in fantasy leagues despite acting as the likely lead back in a Shanahan system that's going to have to rely heavily on the run this week while possibly missing the team's top QB, RB, WR and TE. San Francisco still sports a strong offensive line, and Wilson figures to be busy on Sunday, when he surprises the fantasy community by finishing as a top-20 back in Week 3.

The British Royal Family are facing increasing pressure to tighten purse strings across the board after the latest royal accounts reveal that the establishment will suffer an estimated $44.5 million shortfall due to COVID-19 losses.                                                                                    A sharp decline of tourist numbers at royal residences across the country due to the pandemic will see the queen lose over $6.3 million a year for at least the next three years, a senior aide confirms to _BAZAAR.com_. "In responding to both these financial challenges, we have no intention of asking for extra funding and will look to manage the impact through our own efforts and efficiencies," Sir Michael Stevens, the queen's treasurer, explains.                                                                                    Despite not asking for extra funding as a result of the pandemic, the queen will continue to receive the same $110 million (£86.3 million) from the Sovereign Grant next year for the royal family's official duties and ongoing $468.5 million refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. The queen's income, a U.K. Treasury spokesperson confirms to _BAZAAR_ , will be topped up by the British government to ensure that the Sovereign Grant remains the same.

MIFFLINBURG — Buffalo Township Supervisors announced a public hearing Oct. 5 to consider separate ordinances on parking restrictions, temporary sign regulations and regulating public assemblages and processions.                                                                                  The ordinance on assemblages and processions on township roads calls for a cost-free permit to be applied for in advance. It applies to parades or similar events but not a funeral caravan or military convoy, according to the ordinance proposal. Advance notice of three weeks would be required if using a state highway plus written approval from the state, if necessary.                                                                                  Assemblages are to be applied for at least one week in advance; processions, two weeks.                                                                                  A violation could bring a summary offense and fine of up to $1,000.                                                                                  Supervisor William Zimmerman said the ordinance on assemblages and processions was in the works before an impromptu protest occurred earlier this month in the township after vandals spray-painted a Nazi symbol on a road sign.

High school students are being warned about hefty fines if they don't follow physical distancing guidelines during the pandemic.                                                                                    Tracy Austin, a  spokesperson for the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board, said Friday that Assumption College and St. John's College students were told to stay six feet from each other during off-property breaks or risk getting tickets of up to $800.                                                                                    The issue was raised more than a week ago after a photograph was shared widely on social media showing scores of St. John's students closely lined up at a nearby Tim Hortons during their lunch hour.                                                                                    "Bylaw officers visited the schools to inform them they were going to begin ticketing students who were found not adhering to social distancing guidelines," Austin said.                                                                                    "An (electronic) message will go home on Monday to notify families about it and emphasize the importance of social distancing."                                                                                    Austin said teachers are also using class time to re-enforce the importance of health guidelines, particularly physical distancing.                                                                                    "This issue was brought to our attention through emails and phone calls so we're trying to get all families on board. We're really looking for that home-school partnership to emphasize the message."                                                                                    Along with warnings, St. John's and Assumption vice-principals visit the nearby plaza each lunch hour to monitor students.                                                                                    "School staff is doing everything it can to support the bylaw officers, the community and the plaza businesses," said Austin.                                                                                    Ryan Spiteri, spokesperson for the Brant County Health Unit, said bylaw officers have not yet begun to issue tickets to those ignoring physical distancing guidelines.

If there ever was a year to buckle down on budgeting and learn how to improve ranch record keeping, it would be 2020. Logan Hoffman, who works in beef Extension at Colorado State University, spoke about this topic at High Plains Journal’s Cattle U virtual event Sept. 8 to 11. During his presentation, Hoffman outlined three areas to master in order to better understand their ranch operations and they are profit centers, cost centers and support centers.                                                                                  Hoffman also delved into common misconceptions and tips on how to calculate an accurate and consistent unit cost of production number and how to utilize that final number to be more profitable.                                                                                  “The end goal of accounting is how do I make more money on my operation,” he said. “If you’re working in any type of production-based business, as farmers and ranchers are, you have to make decisions on what types of products to make. Using accurate production and accounting practices will help you understand the margins. I work with producers all over Colorado and that’s what we help them do, but I can tell you that most producers don’t do this very effectively. In essence, they’re running a business without understanding if they are making money or not.”                                                                                  Hoffman said many farming and ranching operations can get away with not understanding margins because they have equity built up. Banks will loan them money because of their collateral, but no farm can last forever with this accounting strategy, he warns. The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing producers to know their margins just to stay in business during a hard-hitting year.

Coastal Cleanup Day is part of the global cleanup effort of removing polluting litter and debris from local community beaches and waterways. Gulls fans are encouraged to join the hockey club's mascot, Gulliver, to protect the health of our community, environment, beaches and waterways by staying close to home and cleaning collection spots for trash.                                                                                  Coastal Cleanup Day is California's most anticipated and high-profile volunteer event. In 2019, over 74,000 participants gathered at more than 1,000 sites and removed trash and recycling. It is popular for good reason: California's beaches and inland waterways are collection spots for trash. The cleanup offers a way for volunteers to respond to the threat of trash in our environment by removing trash before the winter rains arrive and wash it out to the ocean, where it harms marine life and our shared ecosystem.

Photo submissions must be posted by 12 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 26.
