The virus has been running rampant in Wisconsin since September. The state was fourth in the country in per capita cases over the last two weeks as of Monday, with 840 cases per 100,000 people. The governor asked residents to voluntarily shelter in place, limit their interactions to a total of five people, and get takeout or delivery rather than eating at restaurants.

_Reports of water leaking on board the Nabarima and of the tanker tilting began to emerge in July. In September, the tanker had taken on ten feet of water and a five-degree tilt, and recent footage showed the tanker has tilted to an estimated 25 degrees. According to experts, the 2020 hurricane season has been the second most active on record, with 26 named storms so far. With prevailing currents and wind directions, an oil spill of this magnitude could threaten the entire Southern Caribbean for years to come, including long-term genetic damages on coastal ecosystems. Three major oil leaks in Venezuela's national parks and refineries have occurred in the past three months as years of mismanagement and corruption have brought the country's aging infrastructure to the brink of collapse. The state-owned PDVSA was responsible for more than 46,000 spills of crude and other pollutants between 2010 and 2016, according to one estimate. The Nabarima is an environmental catastrophe in the making that we must prevent._

In what is perhaps _the_ plot twist to end all plot twists―which is saying a lot because 2020 has been a moment― _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm _produced __some of the best acting I've seen in years. Say what you want about it as a whole, but there's no denying the level of talent in the film. It takes an extreme amount of focus, dedication and skill to pull off stunts like crashing and disrupting an event with the VP of the United States or catching President Trump's lawyer in a compromising position (no, like, literally with his hands down his pants).
 We expect such ridiculous antics from Sasha Baron Cohen after his groundbreaking performance in the original _Borat,_ but the sequel had a secret weapon no one saw coming: __ Maria Bakalova, who plays his daughter.
 So who is this mystery actress who 1. stayed in character during the most awkward/uncomfortable/disgusting situations, 2. kept up with Baron Cohen while they did universally embarrassing things in public and 3. beat the justice department by catching Rudy Giuliani red-handed, committing indecent and (potentially) illegal behavior?

"If someone expresses a more conservative worldview, they're immediately called a Nazi and a racist and a misogynist and a homophobe and everything under the sun," Friedman said. "I'm none of those things. I'm just a normal friggin' person who has a different point of view."
 At the other end of the political spectrum, Jeff Marinstein, a business and technology consultant from Connecticut, has also been trying to get past the ever-intensifying invective and insults from "friends."
 One, in particular, kept attacking him as a "libtard," among other things. Marinstein no longer talks to that guy. But with another, he's trying a new strategy to save the friendship, suggesting they keep talking, just not about politics. So far, it's proving harder to enforce than he thought.
 "I'm still getting this nightly stream of _New York Post_ articles and memes [mocking] Democrats, and I simply respond with a funny line that says 'This post violates our agreement not to talk about politics,' trying to creatively send the message that I just don't want to engage," he said.
 Whether the strategy ultimately works or not, Marinstein says, he wonders whether it may ultimately be doing as much harm as good.
 "It just feels like the healthiest thing for me to do at the moment to lower the temperature, and to not continue these toxic conversations," he said. "But I suppose the risk is that I'm just retreating into my own information bubble with people who think just like me."
 Indeed, experts say it's _more_ conversation — not _less_ — that's needed, if the nation is to heal its blistering divide. But it has to be healthy, productive conversation. And Israel, who runs the workshops on civil discourse, says the first step must be to take it off social media, and talk in person instead.
 "The only useful comment that you can make on somebody's social media post is 'Can we find a time to talk about this? I'm interested in hearing more,'" she said.

"Democrats are a little bit more likely to say they'd end a friendship" Kiley said. "But Republicans may be less likely to say they have friends on the other side. So it may not be all that differential."
 Another recent poll by PRRI shows that 8-in-10 Republicans believe the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists, while 8-in-10 Democrats believe the Republican Party has been taken over by racists. The report is aptly named titled "Dueling Realities."
 Tania Israel, a professor in the Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology Department at the University of California Santa Barbara, said she's seeing more and more of those kinds of distorted views in the workshops she runs on cross-the-aisle conversations. The rancor is rising, she said, as both sides "tend to view the other as being more extreme than they actually are."
 Another thing conservatives and liberals have in common, she said, is that they all suffer from big blind spots when it comes to the morality of their own side. They tend to view themselves as eminently fair and right, and the other side as wholly irrational.
 Case in point: explaining _his_ politics, Ricardo Deforest noted, "When I say all these things, I think I sound fairly reasonable," while declaiming the _other_ side, with, "There's something wrong with these people."
 Jensen, meantime, is just as certain, upbraiding the guy she was arguing with as "brainwashed."
 Israel says a little more listening to understand, a little less trying to convince, and a lot more intellectual humility would do _everyone_ a world of good.

But you're like, 'What in the world?' I don't think Kate's going to take a side but I think that she's actually honestly happy for Madison because it's a great thing for Madison too.

This story includes warring tribes and arcane magical cliques, but it's never clear which are the "good guys." Make that "good girls:" Liu has populated her world largely with women. Rather than introducing a matriarchal vibe, this choice just makes everything more uncertain. It certainly upends any sentimental notion of traditional "feminine" virtues.

After they dated for a few years, a source said, "Blake has wanted to take his time with marriage, but he is absolutely committed to Gwen. They both feel they've found their true partner in life and plan to be together forever."


  In addition to wanting to take it slow, back in December, sources said Gwen and Blake getting married "isn't possible currently" because she is Roman Catholic and filed for divorce from Gavin Rossdale in 2015. According to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, "Unless one's spouse has died, the Church requires the divorced Catholic to obtain a declaration of nullity before marrying someone else." That means Gwen had to get an annulment before she could marry Blake. Hence him waiting to propose! But it looks like they obviously got that all sorted out.


  The couple didn't reveal when fans could expect them to tie the knot, but all that will surely come in due time.

And just going back to that point on AD, if you were going to say -- it depends how you look at that surplus and is it earning money or not. You remember that high liquidity or low AD ratio is giving you access to an inherently higher return market in Asia and the Middle East. So, you don't necessarily deploy all the liquidity to get every last ounce of earnings out of it, but having that liquidity there allows you to access an inherently higher return market, Asia and Middle East, the emerging markets. That gives you a higher level of compensation for the amount of lending that you're doing. So you earn it in a different way than full deployment into low volatility, low return markets, you're getting the earnings in a different way from HSBC.

_The Nabarima -- operated under a joint venture by Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petr oleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and Italy's energy company Eni -- currently sits in the Gulf of Paria with 80 million gallons of oil on board. If the oil spills, it is estimated the damages would be five times worse than the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. It would cause long term ecological harm to the rich biodiversity of the region, jeopardize the livelihood of more than 50,000 fishermen, and threaten the entire ecological system of the Southern Caribbean. We understand Eni has offered to ensure the safe offloading of oil from the Nabarima, using state-of-the-art solutions. However, the company is seeking assurance from the U.S. government that such activities would not risk sanctions violations for Eni and its contractors. _
