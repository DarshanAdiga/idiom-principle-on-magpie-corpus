Dass sein Konzert etwas von einer Versuchsanordnung hat, habe ihn nicht gestört, wird er später sagen. Er habe in Corona-Zeiten Autokinokonzerte überstanden, „da ist das Konzert hier gefühlt ein erster Fortschritt“. Und tatsächlich stehen sogar einige Fans auf und winken mit den Armen. Die Bässe wummern, das Licht blinkt. Fast wie bei einem echten Konzert.
 Bendzko findet, dass es dringend einen Plan braucht, wie die Veranstaltungsbranche weiter machen könnte. Sonst sei irgendwann nichts mehr übrig von ihr. Applaus bei Internetkonzerten bezahle keine Miete. Natürlich sei Sicherheit das Wichtigste, sagt der 35-Jährige. Aber er sei auch dafür, nach Lösungen zu suchen. „Und dafür braucht es Erkenntnisse.“
 Angefühlt hat sich das Konzert übrigens überraschend gut, sagt der Künstler. „Es hat uns richtig Spaß gemacht, es war nicht so skurril, wie erwartet. Das Publikum hat gut mitgemacht – Leipzig ist textsicher“.

Aug 20 (Reuters) - Steve Bannon has been charged with defrauding Trump supporters in a campaign to help build the president's signature wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, prosecutors said on Thursday.


  Bannon served as a top adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and later worked as White House chief strategist before leaving the administration in August 2017.


  Seven other Trump associates have either been charged or convicted of various crimes.


  ROGER STONE


  Roger Stone, Trump's longtime friend and adviser, was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.


  A Washington jury in November 2019 convicted Stone on all seven criminal counts of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress, and tampering with a witness.


  The day before Stone was due to report to prison to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months, Trump commuted his sentence.


  PAUL MANAFORT


  Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax fraud and bank fraud in a jury trial in August 2018. A month later, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to money laundering, lobbying violations and witness tampering.


  Prosecutors said he tried to conceal millions of dollars he was paid as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians.


  He was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison and in May was released to finish his sentence at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.


  MICHAEL COHEN


  Trump's former personal lawyer is serving a three-year prison sentence at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. He pleaded guilty in August 2018 to crimes including orchestrating 'hush money' payments before the 2016 election to women who had said they had sexual encounters with Trump.


  Cohen also pleaded guilty in November 2018 to lying to Congress about negotiations concerning a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow, a project that never materialized. He said Trump implicitly directed him to lie about the project.


  Trump has denied those allegations.


  MICHAEL FLYNN


  The retired Army lieutenant general served as Trump's national security adviser for less than a month in 2017. He pleaded guilty that year to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russia's ambassador to the United States in the weeks before Trump took office.


  He then accused the FBI of entrapping him and asked the judge to dismiss the charge. The Justice Department has denied the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.


  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule on the matter.


  RICK GATES


  The former deputy chairman of Trump's campaign pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy against the United States and lying to investigators. Gates agreed to cooperate with former Special Counsel Robert Mueller and testified as a prosecution witness against Manafort, his former business partner, and Stone. Gates was sentenced in December 2019 to 45 days in jail.


  GEORGE NADER


  George Nader, an informal Trump adviser on foreign policy and witness in the Mueller investigation, was sentenced in June to 10 years in prison by a federal judge in Virginia. He pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography and bringing a boy to the United States for sex.


  GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS


  The former Trump campaign adviser was sentenced in September 2018 to 14 days in prison after pleading guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials and a Maltese professor who told him the Russians had "dirt" on Clinton.

NORTON, Mass. — It took a disappointing par for Scottie Scheffler to realize he was making enough birdies to have a shot at 59, and he seized on the chance Friday with four birdies over his last five holes to post the 12th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history.


  For the longest time, it looked like his 59 might not even be the best of the day at The Northern Trust.


  As Scheffler was signing his card, Dustin Johnson had already set off on an explosive start that put some buzz into the TPC Boston even without any spectators on the course.


  Birdie. Eagle. Birdie. Eagle. Birdie.


  He was 9 under through eight holes, and with two birdies to start the back nine, Johnson was 11 under through 11 holes.


  And then he turned into a par machine, with only two good looks at birdie the rest of the way, and one decision he'd like to have back. Johnson hit driver on the par-5 18th into a slope of grungy grass, when a 3-wood was all he would have needed to have a mid-iron into the green. He had to lay up, hit wedge to 25 feet and two-putted for a seventh straight par.


  Johnson shot a 60, had a two-shot lead, and it almost felt as though condolences were in order.


  "If I hit the fairway there, it's a pretty easy 4. But I didn't, so shot 60," Johnson said. "That's OK, though. I'm pretty happy with it. Pretty happy with my position leading into the weekend."


  Johnson was at 15-under 127, two shots ahead of Scheffler and Cameron Davis (66). Scheffler finished with two putts from across the 18th green for his 12th birdie, knocking in his last putt from 4 feet.


  "You don't really get a putt for 59 often, so I was quite nervous over the putt, but that's nothing new," Scheffler said. "I get nervous over every shot. That's just playing competitive golf."


  Not since the John Deere Classic in 2010 have two players had 60 or lower on the same day. That contributed to Tiger Woods feeling irritated by his pedestrian 71 that allowed him to make the cut on the number and left him 12 shots back.


  "I just didn't quite have it," Woods said. "I was close to snapping a couple clubs today, but I didn't, so that's a positive."


  Scheffler, the smooth 24-year-old rookie from Texas, didn't do hardly anything wrong. Two good wedges from tough spots around the green set up birdies early, and he kept pouring them in. That included a 6-foot par putt on the 17th hole that set up the birdie he needed for a 59.


  On the 18th, his tee shot hopped out of the rough and into the first cut. From 215 yards, he wisely aimed toward the left section of the green, hit 5-iron just short and had two putts from 85 feet for a 59. He rolled the long eagle attempt about 4 feet short, went over to his bag for a swig of water while waiting his turn, and calmly rolled it in.


  Scheffler was trying to make as many birdies as possible. It was only after he missed a 10-foot birdie chance on the 13th that he began to realize what he was doing.


  "I was like, 'Oh, man, that would have been a nice one to go in' because I was playing really good at that point," he said. "Kind of clicked like, 'Hey, I have a chance to do something pretty cool today.'"


  That makes five straight years with a 59 or better on the PGA Tour.


  This stood out as the 59 that generated the least amount of excitement, not on a spectator-free course with no scoreboards in the groups. Scheffler played with Kevin Streelman and Tony Finau, and only one of them knew what was going on.


  "We don't have the sign bearers, so I brought it up to Tony on 17 green, and he had no idea," Streelman said. "He thought it was 7 or 8 (under) and I'm like, 'No, he's like 11 right now.' That's the difference. There would definitely have been electricity, fans running in. He still had the pressure to step up there on 18 and make that nice up-and-down, and he played awesome.


  "He played perfect golf today."


  So did Johnson. He made it look so easy that Marc Leishman, playing in his group, starting wondering about the lowest score anyone ever shot. "A 59 didn't even seem like a question," Leishman said.


  Johnson holed a 40-foot eagle putt on No. 2. He hit driver to 4 feet for eagle on No. 4. The rest of his birdie putts were in range, mostly from 12 feet or closer. And he kept making them, until the birdies dried up quickly.


  Johnson missed a 12-footer on the 13th and a 10-footer on the 17th. And then he failed to make birdie on the last hole, the easiest of the day on the TPC Boston.


  A 59 is no longer the record — Furyk shot 58 at the Travelers Championship in 2016 — but it's still considered golf's magic number. It was the second time Scheffler shot 59 this year. He also had one during with friends in Dallas when the tour shut down for three months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Johnson will have to wait.


  "I wanted to shoot 59. I've never done it," he said.


  Never?


  "Not that I remember," Johnson said, breaking into a smile before adding, "And I think I'd remember that."


  Meanwhile, the FedEx Cup playoffs ended early for some two dozen players who missed the cut and were assured of not making the top 70 who advance to the BMW Championship next week. That includes Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka, who withdrew before the tournament began.

 # Bengals making running game point of emphasis during scrimmages
 Tyler Dragon
 Cincinnati Enquirer
 The Cincinnati Bengals offense started Friday’s scrimmage with two-straight Joe Mixon runs. Zac Taylor’s initial two play calls were a prelude to what’s to come during team scrimmages the rest of the way.
 Taylor and the Bengals want to prioritize the ground game when the offense and defense scrimmage in training camp.
 “I thought offensively the run game, it was a good starting point for our first scrimmage. Obviously, that’s a point of emphasis. We get plenty of work in the passing game,” Taylor said. “Just the way that we operate over the last couple weeks. So, when you finally put the pads on you want to see guys run the ball. That was a big point of emphasis for us on both sides.”
 Mixon saw limited action in Friday’s scrimmage. The Bengals want to preserve his body. Running backs Jacques Patrick, Trayveon Williams and Samaje Perine got the bulk of the carries. Patrick and Perine had the best performances in the backfield. Patrick had three nice carries and a touchdown run. Perine had the first team’s third and final touchdown on an outside run where he took advantage of a Jonah Williams clear-out block.
 Cincinnati had a decent balance of run and pass in their opening scrimmage. If the Bengals hope to get out of the division cellar, the run game on both sides of the ball must improve.
 The Bengals went into Week 8 last year with the worst rushing attack in NFL, averaging just 53 yards per game. Mixon and the offensive line kicked things into gear and revitalized the running game in the second half of the season. A total of 72% of Mixon’s 1,137 rushing yards came in the final eight games.
 Several members of the offense said they want to build off how they finished last season running the football. Three of Mixon’s four 100-plus yard rushing performances came in the final month of the season, including a career-high 162 rushing yards in the season finale versus the Cleveland Browns.
 On the other side of the ball, the Bengals defense gave up a league-worst 148.9 yards a game on the ground in 2019. The team signed stout run defenders D.J. Reader, Vonn Bell and Josh Bynes in free agency in an attempt to shore up the run defense. The three of them are slated to start Week 1.
 “We need to not let people run the ball. It has to start there,” Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo said to The Enquirer. “It all starts up front with those guys with stopping the run and the linebackers fitting things the right way and the defensive backs closing the outside with the perimeter runs.
 “We have an historic rushing team in our division in Baltimore. So, you have to be able to stop the run. Pittsburgh’s been a team that’s always been able to run it. Cleveland has two great backs, so I’m sure their new head coach is going to try to establish the run. So, it all starts with stopping the run.”
 Joe Burrow received most of the recognition following Friday’s scrimmage, but it all starts with the run game in Cincinnati. The Bengals are cognizant that they must upgrade their run offense and run defense if they want to compete in the AFC North division.

 AMSTERDAM, Aug 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Dutch online retailer Bol.com has become the latest firm to ban products depicting "Black Pete", a caricatured figure from pre-Christmas celebrations, in response to anti-racism campaigns.
 All products depicting "Black Pete" in a discriminatory way must be removed from the platform by the end of September, Bol.com, one of the biggest book, toy and electronics retailers in the Netherlands, said in a statement.
 "Following recently received feedback and insights we have concluded that 'Black Piet' can be seen as hurtful," the company said, adding that it had asked the Dutch ministry of justice and the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights for advice.
 "Bol.com is a shop for everyone. That means that everyone has to be able to have access to us and feel welcome. Feeling welcome doesn't match with products that incite discrimination or hate."
 Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in June that many children felt the tradition - where St. Nicholas brings gifts to kids accompanied by numerous "Petes", clownish servants usually portrayed by white people in blackface - was discriminatory.
 Bol.com's decision comes weeks after Facebook and Instagram banned blackface, which originated in 1830s New York shows, when slavery was still legal in the U.S. South, with white performers blackening their faces to make fun of slaves as lazy and stupid.
 Black Pete supporters argue that he is not meant to portray black skin colour, but chimney soot, or a fantasy figure.
 "The Netherlands is getting better!" Jerry Afriyie, a Dutch-based human rights activist who has campaigned against Black Pete, said on Twitter, adding that he hoped more companies would follow suit.
 Following anti-racism protests in the Netherlands, the Dutch central bank and ABN Amro bank are investigating their roles in the slave trade. The Dutch West India Company operated ships that traded some 500,000 slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries.

 This isn't the first time Samsung's SSDs have dropped to prices like this, but it's an easier sell with the T7. So long as you plug into a computer that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2, you can read and write at speeds around 1,000MB/s -- roughly twice as quick as for the T5. That gives it a distinct edge over other lower-cost SSDs, especially if you intend to transfer large files on a regular basis.
 The T7 otherwise represents a familiar formula from Samsung. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. While the design is unexciting, it's slim, drop resistant up to 6 feet and will throttle back if there's ever danger of the drive overheating. USB-C is increasingly par for the course on external storage, but still welcome if you want some future-proofing. Just don't expect any special tricks.

Wake up, Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance and seniors counting on Social Security and Medicare to pay monthly bills and cover the bulk of medical care! Those programs are dangerously at risk under Donald Trump.
   
 Already by July 2017, Republicans had attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act 70 times. On June 25, 2020, in the midst of a growing pandemic, Trump urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, with nothing to replace it. He has currently signed on to a Texas case, going before the Supreme Court, which would do just that. Were the court to make such a move, 20 million people could lose health coverage!
   
 Donald Trump is NO friend of Social Security and Medicare. He has no compassion for the 63 million plus families who cherish those programs as lifelines. Trump has said he would cut benefits to balance the next federal budget. He has proposed eliminating payroll taxes, if re-elected. Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare.
   
 Families need an advocate for their needs in the White House. Joe Biden is that person. Joe will fight to improve the quality of life for all. He will protect and preserve the Affordable Care Act, Social Security and Medicare. Biden is for the people! Vote for Biden for president Nov. 3.

  MILLER -- The son of a man serving life behind bars in the Springfield killings of a pregnant woman and her three children has been charged in a weekend homicide.


  Lyle DeLong, 23, is among three people charged with first-degree murder after 27-year-old Sarah Pasco was found shot to death Sunday near Miller. A friend of hers was critically wounded.


  DeLong is the son of Richard DeLong, who was convicted in the 1999 killings of Erin Vanderhoef and her children. Lyle DeLong's mother, Stacie Leffingwell, was suspected of being an accomplice in the Vanderhoef murders, but she died before going to trial, the Springfield News-Leader reports.


  Online records indicate Lyle DeLong is being held in the Lawrence County Jail without bond.


  Authorities say Pasco and another woman were abducted and shot. The other victim was able to help authorities locate Pasco's body.


  The probable cause statement in the case identifies Gary Hunter as the suspected shooter in the Pasco homicide but says Lyle DeLong played a role in the events, including allegedly lighting a vehicle on fire after the shootings.


  He does not have an attorney listed for this case.

Parents and other guardians need to exercise extreme caution at home. Always check that battery compartments are securely fastened, advises the National Safety Council, and keep toys belonging to older children that might contain button batteries out of reach of younger children.


  Place devices that contain button batteries out of sight and beyond the reach of youngsters. When purchasing replacement batteries, look for child-resistant safety packaging. Don’t allow children to play with batteries or with batter- powered products that have easily accessible batteries.


  If you suspect a button battery has been ingested or someone has sustained another battery-related injury, call the National Battery Ingestion Hotline at 800-498-8666 or take the person to the hospital immediately.

  Aug 21 (Reuters) - European shares were flat on Friday ahead of business activity data that could throw light on the pace of economic recovery in the continent, while a stronger pound dragged UK's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 lower.


  The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1% by 0720 GMT, still reeling from weak U.S. data and downbeat tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve that sparked a selloff on Thursday.


  The blue-chip FTSE 100 slipped 0.3% even as data showed retail sales surged past their pre-coronavirus level in July, although economists feared the broad recovery could prove temporary.


  All eyes will be on the Markit's flash survey of European purchasing managers in August, which is expected to show that a pick-up in business activity stagnated in August after a rebound in July.


  Travel and leisure stocks were the biggest sectoral gainers, up 1.2%, but losses in financial services and telecoms dragged on the broader index.


  Irish building and insulation materials firm Kingspan jumped 5.5% after its chief executive said the company saw significant pent up demand post-lockdown.


  Swiss drugmaker Novartis gave the biggest boost to the STOXX 600 after it won U.S. health regulator's approval to repurpose an 11-year-old blood cancer drug against multiple sclerosis. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)

The Delhi Police on Saturday said they have arrested a 36-year-old suspected operative of the Islamic State. Police said the man had planned a "lone wolf" terror strike in a high footfall area in the city "using a high-intensity pressure cooker-based improvised explosive device (IED)".
 Police did not specify the "high-footfall area" that the man was to target, but said he hailed from a village in Uttar Pradesh's Balrampur, and was set to carry out the IED blasts.
 Police said they received information that the alleged operative, Mohammed Mushtaqeem Khan, would pass by Dhaula Kuan area on Friday. Officers of the special cell said around 11pm, the man was intercepted and caught after a shoot-out in the Ridge area between Dhaula Kuan and Karol Bagh. Police said they recovered two pressure cooker IEDs weighing around 15kg, a.30 bore pistol and four cartridges that Khan was carrying in a bag. Khan was on a white TVS Apache motorcycle at the time of his arrest.
 "Five shots were exchanged, including three fired on the raiding party by Khan. Nobody was injured," deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Kushwah said.
 On Saturday morning, around a dozen National Security Guard (NSG) officers, including those from its bomb disposal squad, carried out a "controlled blast" to dispose of the IEDs, for which they created a pit inside the Buddha Jayanti Park and cordoned off the entire area as a safety and precautionary measure.
 The team used a remote-controlled vehicle to lift and contain the IEDs. The operation last nearly three hours. The IEDs were ready for use and only installation of timers were needed for carrying out explosions, Kushwah said.
 In a press statement, police said Khan's interrogation has revealed that his original plan was to carry out the IED blasts during the Independence Day celebrations on August 15.
 "However, because of the heavy security arrangements, Khan could not enter the city and had to drop the terror strike plan, Kushwah said.
 During a press briefing, the DCP said Khan had planned the blasts on the directions of his handler, a commander of the ISKP (Islamic State of Khorasan Province) in Afghanistan, which is a banned terrorist organisation and is a part of IS. The officer did not disclose the handler's name, saying it would hamper their probe.
 Khan was in touch with the commander through social media, they said. "Khan told us that he was more inclined to "fidayeen (suicide) attack". But his handler had told him that after successfully executing the IEDs blasts, he would be getting fresh instructions to carry out a fidayeen attack. He claims that he has already prepared "an explosive belt" for the fidayeen attack. We are verifying his claims and trying to recover it," Kushwah said, adding that the ownership of the motorcycle with UP registration that Khan was riding is being verified
 Khan has told the police that he learnt to make "IEDs and suicide belt" through videos on social media. "He has told us that he carried out a successful dry run of a small IED blast at a burial ground in his village. Also, he prepared the two pressure cooker IEDs himself. We are verifying his claims," the DCP said.
 On Saturday, Khan was sent to eight-day police custody by a Delhi court.
 A Class 9 drop-out, Khan runs a cosmetic shop at his village in Balrampur, where his wife and four children also live.
 Uttar Pradesh police has sounded a statewide alert on Saturday after Khan's arrest , Prashant Kumar, additional director general (ADG) of police (law and order), said. Kumar said all district police chiefs have been asked to intensify vigil and carry out extensive drives to check the movement of suspicious people.

Aug 20 (Reuters) - Steve Bannon shaped the right-wing U.S. political media environment that paved the way for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, which he helped lead to victory.


  On Thursday, Bannon was arrested and charged with defrauding Trump supporters who donated to an effort to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Here is a look at Bannon's career:


  CONSERVATIVE MEDIA PROVOCATEUR


  Before he took over as chief executive of Trump's 2016 campaign, Bannon, 66, headed and co-founded Breitbart News, a website and voice for the alt-right movement, a loose right-wing confederation that includes hardcore nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.


  With a disheveled look marked by a tendency to wear multiple layers of shirts, Bannon attacked "globalists" and was seen as one of the architects behind Trump's "America First" agenda.


  WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST


  Five days after Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, he rewarded Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker and a Navy veteran who dabbled in movie-making, by appointing him senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation.


  In the few months that he was on the job, Bannon helped drive the right-wing and populist parts of Trump's agenda. He railed against the Paris Climate Agreement from which Trump pledged to withdraw, and pushed him to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president later replaced with a United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.


  He was a force behind Trump's controversial and poorly implemented travel ban that sought to bar U.S. entry to people from several Muslim-majority countries, and he supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, one of Trump's signature campaign promises.


  AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE


  Trump turned on Bannon over the strategist's comments to the author of a book highly critical of the president and his family, and fired him in August 2017. Bannon had also clashed with other Trump administration officials.


  The rabble-rousing media entrepreneur briefly returned to Breitbart News, later quitting after angering Trump by harshly criticizing his eldest son.


  Bannon's reputation as a political mastermind took a hit later in 2017, after Republicans lost a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama they had long held when the Bannon-backed Roy Moore, who was accused of improper conduct with teenage girls, fell to Democrat Doug Jones.


  OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES


  Since then, Bannon has sought to expand his influence overseas. He had connections to the Vatican, helping to craft curriculum for a right-wing Roman Catholic institute in Italy in an effort to promote conservative thinking in the church.


  He developed a relationship working with Chinese fugitive billionaire Guo Wengui, at one point appearing in a poorly lit video on a boat in front of the Statue of Liberty to denounce China's ruling Communist Party and call for a new federal state government in the Asian country.

Jeanie Sue (Mueller) Gerrietts April 28, 1968 to August 16, 2020.


  On Sunday, August 16, 2020, after a courageous six-year battle with cancer, Jeanie met face to face with Jesus, her precious Lord and Savior. Jeanie was born on April 28, 1968 in Fond du Lac Wisconsin to Carroll (Smokey) and Janis (nee Weis) Mueller. She grew up in Allenton and graduated from Slinger High School. On August 11, 1996 she married Steven Gerrietts at Glacier Hills County Park. She lived most of her married life in Theresa where she was an awesome mother and teacher to April Debroux (fiance Daniel Hernandez), Drake (Jessica) Gerrietts and Brookelyn (fiance Wyatt Belew).


  Jeanie had a deep faith that she shared with all around her and on mission trips to the villages of Tanana and Ruby in Alaska; and to Ecuador where she ministered to the Huaorani tribe. In August 2000 she joined hundreds of thousands of others for The Call at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to ask people to fast and pray to God for protection and revival of our nation.


  Her joy in life and people was reflected in her lovely singing voice that was often heard lifted in praise and worship. Jeanie had an appreciation of Godºs creation which was reflected in her artistic and photographic ability; talents that she passed on to her children.


  She will be missed by the many people both young and old who looked to her as mother and spiritual mentor and also by all who were touched by her loving and caring nature as she served as a CNA, ordained minister and servant of the Lord.


  Besides her husband and children she is survived by her precious grandson Mateo, her brother Michael (Kristen) Mueller, niece Haley and nephew Andrew, her parents, mother-in-law Loralee Gerrietts, brother-in-law Jeff (Patti) Gerrietts; sisters-in-law Kathy (Lincoln) Smithyman, Christine (Tom) Taylor, Nadine (Shawn) Race, Cindy (Wren) Gerrietts and her faithful and loyal dog — her Koda bear , and many nieces, nephews, friends and relatives.


  She was preceded in death by her daughter, Serena, her father-in-law, Dennis Gerrietts Sr., her brother-in-law Dennis Gerrietts Jr., her grandparents, Leo and Marie (nee Warnecke) Weis and Jerome and Loretta (nee Schmidt) Mueller.


  We would like to acknowledge the caretakers who gave of themselves to comfort mom in her final weeks this side of heaven, and for all the continuous prayers from the Springfield Church, all family, and the many friends. Thank you from the sincerity of our hearts.


  A celebration of life for Jeanie will be held on Friday, August 28, 2020 at 6 p.m. at the Shimon Funeral Home (824 Union St. Hartford, WI 53027). The family will greet relatives and friends at the funeral home from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.


  The Shimon Funeral Home is serving the family. Online condolences and tributes may be shared at www.shimonfuneralhome.com.

The images coming to life on the formerly gray walls are bright, cheerful, hope-inspiring.


   


  A tree of life. A smiling family. Sprouting flowers. A vibrant mandala pattern. Meditators at peace with the world.


   


  A foreshadowing, expectantly, of a new start for this beautiful but troubled park.


   


  Back in July, a handful of Pueblo teenagers concerned about the dark cloud that fell over Vinewood Park once the sun set decided to bring some much needed light into the recreational space.


   


  Alexandria Ramirez and Makenzie Baca contacted Barbara Alphin, volunteer coordinator for city's parks and recreation department, with an offer to beautify the Canterbury Lane park for those, especially children, who find solace and enjoyment there.


   


  Alphin immediately came on board and a partnership was formed.


   


  Before long, trash receptacles and park benches were given a fresh coat of paint, with the youthful community activists laying out plans for a large- scale mural to cover a patio structure's walls that routinely fell victim to vandals.


   


  Today, that dazzling mural is in the final stages of completion, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Pueblo Arts Alliance, invited into the project by Alphin.


   


  Working from a design envisioned by Ramirez and Baca, with additional motifs presented by Alphin, commissioned artists and volunteers from the arts alliance's Impact Youth Initiative have spent the past two weeks transforming the often vandalized canvas into a life-affirming beacon.


   


  With paint provided at a discount by Southern Colorado Services and Recycling, the muralists are imbuing the piece with a spirit of hope and optimism they hope will carry over to those who visit the park.


   


  "The design is actually inspired by the park and nature, and community and family," explained Cynthia Ramu of the Pueblo Arts Alliance.


   


  Those fashioning the multi-piece mural are doing so in hopes of banishing the foreboding aura associated with the park.


   


  At least one suicide, along with vandalism, underage drinking, fighting and other unseemly acts have tarnished the park's reputation while causing concern to those who live nearby.


   


  "I love doing community service stuff," said volunteer artist Phoebe Black, 15. "So I hope this mural will bring more positivity to the park. I live down the street and a lot of bad things have happened here.


   


  "Hopefully, people will be inspired by the mural."


   


  "This is a rough neighborhood," added Paige Viglione, also 15. "So I think the brightness of the mural will bring some light in."


   


  Marty Henderson, a retired paint contractor who has lived on Canterbury Lane since 1965, has taken a special interest in the beautification project.


   


  In addition to moral support, Henderson has provided cold water to the muralists throughout the undertaking.


   


  He also keeps a keen eye on park activities, especially when the sun sets.


   


  "I've watched the park for years, and seen the graffiti and everything else that happens here," Henderson said. "I've personally painted this patio building about 27 times, just to try to show the kids who came to graffiti that I had more paint than they did."


   


  Trouble, Henderson said, continues to find its way into the park.


   


  "We had a problem last night," he said. "We had young people out here late, drinking too much and breaking beer bottles. They threw some into my yard, and other yards.


   


  "I'm just hoping that once they get this mural finished, somebody without any intelligence doesn't come by and put their name on it."


   


  David Martinez, Henderson's neighbor, took his support of the park a step further by officially adopting it from the city.


   


  And like Henderson, he keeps watch over the park and isn't reluctant to report illegal activity.


   


  In doing so, however, Martinez has experienced incidents of frightening retaliation.


   


  Back in late July, Martinez's home was shot up multiple times by youth he believes were unhappy with his reporting of their illegal activities.


   


  The incident remains under investigation, and Martinez said he will not be deterred from trying to make Vinewood Park the safe haven it was designed to be.


   


  "It's a good place for the kids," Martinez said. "And I just hate to see all the trash and youngsters who come out at night, causing a bunch of havoc: breaking beer bottles and acting like a bunch of fools."


   


  Today, Ramu is inviting community members to picnic at the park from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.


   


  "We want people to come and enjoy this beautiful park and really pretty area," Ramu said. "We will be painting most of that time and if there are some painters that would like to pitch in and help us touch up some stuff, we would welcome them.


   


  "We want to celebrate the beauty and the power teens have in this community."

By Dan Levine and Marisa Taylor


  Aug 20 (Reuters) - A top U.S. health regulator who will help decide the fate of a coronavirus vaccine has vowed to resign if the Trump administration approves a vaccine before it is shown to be safe and effective, Reuters has learned.


  Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, made the statement in response to concerns raised on a conference call late last week of government officials, pharmaceutical executives and academics who serve on a vaccine working group organized by the National Institutes of Health, according to three sources familiar with the matter.


  When contacted by Reuters, Marks confirmed the account.


  Scientists, public health officials and lawmakers are worried that the Trump administration will pressure the FDA to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine in advance of the November presidential election, even if data from clinical trials do not support its widespread use.


  Marks told Reuters he has not faced any political pressure and that the FDA would be guided by science alone. Should that change, "I could not stand by and see something that was unsafe or ineffective that was being put through," Marks said.


  "You have to decide where your red line is, and that's my red line," he said. "I would feel obligated (to resign) because in doing so, I would indicate to the American public that there's something wrong."


  He added that he would equally object if someone sought political gain by holding up approval of a vaccine that was shown to work, and that was safe.


  Michael Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees FDA and NIH, said the government aims to identify a safe and effective vaccine by January 2021.


  Speculation about the FDA approving a vaccine under political pressure "only undermines confidence in the public health system," Caputo said in a statement. "I've never met one FDA regulator who wouldn't resign over improper pressure, and that's how America knows their seal of approval is the gold standard."


  The FDA declined to comment on the meeting.


  President Donald Trump's approval ratings have fallen sharply in the wake of a pandemic that has killed more than 173,000 Americans and infected over 5.5 million. The race to produce a vaccine has become the centerpiece of his administration's response.


  Earlier this month, Trump said a vaccine was possible before the Nov. 3 vote.


  In a statement on Thursday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that under Marks' leadership, the agency's scientists are monitoring the COVID-19 vaccine trials, "the data from which will be the deciding factor for any FDA approval."


  Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, has also said publicly that political considerations will not influence any decision on a coronavirus vaccine.


  OCTOBER SURPRISE?


  Large-scale clinical trials of the leading vaccine candidates from Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc were launched in recent weeks.


  The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its advisory committee of outside experts on coronavirus vaccines on Oct. 22.


  Marks said the trials were enrolling volunteers "reasonably well" and that it was "possible" data could be available to interpret as early as October. If not, the committee could still discuss broader regulatory issues regarding a vaccine, he said.


  On the NIH call with members of its vaccine working group on Aug. 14, some participants asked whether it was realistic to expect sufficient safety and efficacy data from those trials before the election, the sources familiar with the matter said.


  The discussion then turned to concerns about a so-called October surprise announcement, in which the Trump administration rushes to unveil a vaccine candidate, the sources said.


  At that point, they said, Marks told participants on the call that if the FDA were pressured to approve a vaccine without enough evidence of it being safe and effective, he would resign.


  "It was pretty dramatic," one of the sources said. "It was a bold statement."


  EMERGENCY USE


  The U.S. government has invested nearly $11 billion to help develop and manufacture more than half a dozen coronavirus vaccine candidates. Fauci has said the project, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, could identify a successful vaccine by January 2021 and provide tens of millions of doses early in the year.


  Marks, a hematologist, has worked at FDA since 2012 and oversees a division responsible for regulating cutting-edge biotech treatments, vaccines and gene therapies.


  The agency's commissioner Hahn, a political appointee, typically has the power to issue an emergency authorization for a vaccine, expediting the traditional approval process in situations like the current pandemic.


  Marks is the top FDA scientist involved in the process, charged with making a recommendation on any potential vaccine candidate. The Health and Human Services secretary could also overrule any FDA decision, Marks said.


  Earlier this year, the FDA gave emergency authorization for hospitals to use malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment after it had been touted by Trump. The agency later withdrew the authorization after data showed hydroxychloroquine was of no benefit and could harm some patients.


  Hahn, Marks and another FDA official penned an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association this month acknowledging public anxiety about lowering regulatory standards to approve a coronavirus vaccine.


  "FDA is committed to ensuring that any vaccine is manufactured in accordance with all of FDA's quality standards and that its safety and effectiveness are verified before being authorized or licensed," they wrote.


  The officials also pledged that the FDA's vaccine advisory committee would conduct a "transparent discussion" in advance of any vaccine authorization or license.


  It is unclear whether any of the vaccine trials will enroll enough subjects and yield meaningful data for the FDA to review ahead of the U.S. election.


  AstraZeneca could supply the first doses of its vaccine to the United States as soon as October, "assuming FDA approval of safety and efficacy or emergency use authorization of the vaccine," a company spokesman said in a statement to Reuters. He declined to address whether AstraZeneca would have sufficient data to submit to the FDA by then.


  "It is important to remember that -- while the data so far is certainly encouraging -- there is no guarantee that this vaccine will ultimately be approved or granted an emergency use authorization," the spokesman said.


  Pfizer said in a statement that it expects to file with the FDA for emergency authorization or "some form of regulatory approval" as early as October. Moderna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


  Kathryn Edwards, former chairwoman of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee and scientific director at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program, said she does not believe the group would allow itself to be strong-armed into recommending a candidate if the data is inadequate.


  "If it is not done right, there will be such a hue and cry from the scientific community that it will be clearly heard," she said. (Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Marisa Taylor in Washington; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Daniel Wallis)

New Delhi The Delhi Police on Saturday said they have arrested a 36-year-old suspected operative of the Islamic State. Police said the man had planned a "lone wolf" terror strike in a high footfall area in the city "using a high-intensity pressure cooker-based improvised explosive device (IED)". Police did not specify the "high-footfall area" that the man was to target, but said he hailed from a village in Uttar Pradesh's Balrampur, and was set to carry out the IED blasts. Police said they received information that the alleged operative, Mohammed Mushtaqeem Khan, would pass by Dhaula Kuan area on Friday. Officers of the special cell said around 11pm, the man was intercepted and caught after a shoot-out in the Ridge area between Dhaula Kuan and Karol Bagh. Police said they recovered two pressure cooker IEDs weighing around 15kg, a.30 bore pistol and four cartridges that Khan was carrying in a bag. Khan was on a white TVS Apache motorcycle at the time of his arrest. "Five shots were exchanged, including three fired on the raiding party by Khan. Nobody was injured," deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Kushwah said. On Saturday morning, around a dozen National Security Guard (NSG) officers, including those from its bomb disposal squad, carried out a "controlled blast" to dispose of the IEDs, for which they created a pit inside the Buddha Jayanti Park and cordoned off the entire area as a safety and precautionary measure. The team used a remote-controlled vehicle to lift and contain the IEDs. The operation last nearly three hours. The IEDs were ready for use and only installation of timers were needed for carrying out explosions, Kushwah said. In a press statement, police said Khan's interrogation has revealed that his original plan was to carry out the IED blasts during the Independence Day celebrations on August 15. "However, because of the heavy security arrangements, Khan could not enter the city and had to drop the terror strike plan, Kushwah said. During a press briefing, the DCP said Khan had planned the blasts on the directions of his handler, a commander of the ISKP (Islamic State of Khorasan Province) in Afghanistan, which is a banned terrorist organisation and is a part of IS. The officer did not disclose the handler's name, saying it would hamper their probe. Khan was in touch with the commander through social media, they said. "Khan told us that he was more inclined to "fidayeen (suicide) attack". But his handler had told him that after successfully executing the IEDs blasts, he would be getting fresh instructions to carry out a fidayeen attack. He claims that he has already prepared "an explosive belt" for the fidayeen attack. We are verifying his claims and trying to recover it," Kushwah said, adding that the ownership of the motorcycle with UP registration that Khan was riding is being verified Khan has told the police that he learnt to make "IEDs and suicide belt" through videos on social media. "He has told us that he carried out a successful dry run of a small IED blast at a burial ground in his village. Also, he prepared the two pressure cooker IEDs himself. We are verifying his claims," the DCP said. On Saturday, Khan was sent to eight-day police custody by a Delhi court. A Class 9 drop-out, Khan runs a cosmetic shop at his village in Balrampur, where his wife and four children also live. Uttar Pradesh police has sounded a statewide alert on Saturday after Khan's arrest , Prashant Kumar, additional director general (ADG) of police (law and order), said. Kumar said all district police chiefs have been asked to intensify vigil and carry out extensive drives to check the movement of suspicious people.

MILLER -- The son of a man serving life behind bars in the Springfield killings of a pregnant woman and her three children has been charged in a weekend homicide.


   


  Lyle DeLong, 23, is among three people charged with first-degree murder after 27-year-old Sarah Pasco was found shot to death Sunday near Miller. A friend of hers was critically wounded.


   


  DeLong is the son of Richard DeLong, who was convicted in the 1999 killings of Erin Vanderhoef and her children. Lyle DeLong's mother, Stacie Leffingwell, was suspected of being an accomplice in the Vanderhoef murders, but she died before going to trial, the Springfield News-Leader reports.


   


  Online records indicate Lyle DeLong is being held in the Lawrence County Jail without bond.


   


  Authorities say Pasco and another woman were abducted and shot. The other victim was able to help authorities locate Pasco's body.


   


  The probable cause statement in the case identifies Gary Hunter as the suspected shooter in the Pasco homicide but says Lyle DeLong played a role in the events, including allegedly lighting a vehicle on fire after the shootings.


   


  He does not have an attorney listed for this case.

New cases of COVID-19 in Australia’s Victoria state continued to decline Saturday with 182 new infections, along with 13 deaths. It was the second day in a row in which the number of new infections has fallen below 200. Only 24 of the latest cases are without a known source, a contrast to the start of August when hundreds could not be traced. Australia’s second largest city, Melbourne, and parts of rural Victoria were placed in full lockdown in early August. It's due to continue until Sept. 13. “Whilst tomorrow’s numbers will be for tomorrow, we are all pleased to see a ‘one’ in front of these additional case numbers, and to a certain extent, it is perhaps at that level a little quicker than I thought it might be,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. Meanwhile, an outbreak linked to a youth detention center in Queensland state has caused the state’s premier to reintroduce restrictions on public gatherings. The cluster connected to the Brisbane Youth Detention Center now stands at seven, including six confirmed on Saturday. The 127 inmates, some as young as 13, have been locked in their rooms since a 77-year-old female supervisor tested positive on Wednesday. The worker, who is now in a hospital, worked five shifts at the center while infectious. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told a news conference Saturday the cases are of concern because “people have been out and about in the community.”
