Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump's top energy official said he had a "productive discussion" with his Saudi counterpart over the weekend about the instability in oil markets.
 U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, agreed to continue talks through a meeting of G20 energy ministers that will be held "in the near future." Brouillette said he reiterated in the discussion that "what began as a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia has major implications for the United States and the world," according to a transcript of his conversation released by the Energy Department.
 Trump has attempted to broker a deal between the Saudis and Russians, whose price war for market share has combined with the coronavirus pandemic to spur a massive drop in oil demand, undercutting global prices. In an interview with Fox Business, Brouillette said the meeting of energy ministers from the Group of 20 top industrialized nations could happen later this week.
 A meeting of OPEC+ and others -- already delayed once -- is tentatively set for Thursday. Russia and Saudi Arabia want the U.S. to join in, but Trump has so far shown little willingness to do so.
 Brouillette repeated that he's going to look for further storage opportunities for drillers that are fast running out of space to store their excess barrels. Last week, he made 30 million barrels of storage capacity available from the nation's emergency oil reserve. "Oil prices being what they are, It's a great time to fill this petroleum reserve," he said.
 All options are on the table to help the struggling industry, according to the energy secretary. "The president made that very very clear," he said. "For those that would take a predatory advantage of the U.S. market, the president will react accordingly."
 Trump has threatened substantial oil tariffs should prices remain close to their lowest levels in almost two decades. However, he's also made it clear that he expects the former allies to reach a deal on cutting back production.

LONDON -- World stock markets jumped on Monday, encouraged by a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths and new cases, though a delay in talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut supply sent oil tumbling again.
 Equity investors were encouraged as the death toll from the virus slowed across major European nations including France and Italy.
 London's FTSE raced up 2%, indexes in Paris and Milan rose 3%, and Germany's DAX gained more than 4% after Japan's Nikkei finished with similar gains overnight.
 There was plenty of news to demonstrate just how brutal the virus has been - eye-popping plunges in car sales and air travel in Europe, Britain's prime minister being hospitalized and Japan preparing to declare a state of emergency.
 However, the markets appeared hopeful.
 Wall Street S&P 500 emini futures were up almost 3.5% and most major volatility gauges dropped too, buoyed by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that his country was also seeing a "leveling off" of the crisis.
 "What is driving the market is the evidence that the number of new cases has started to turn the corner," said Rabobank's Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot.
 As well as a slowdown in deaths in Italy, he said, improvements were starting to become visible in Spain, and even in the United States there had been a little bit of a let-up.
 "When you see that happening you can start gauging when lockdowns can start to be gradually lifted. That gives a little bit more visibility and that is vital," he added, although he stressed there were still huge uncertainties and risks.
 As has been the pattern for most of the year, commodity markets saw the day's other big moves.
 Brent crude fell as much as $4 after Saudi Arabia and Russia, who have been at loggerheads this year over production, pushed back a planned meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, until Thursday.
 OPEC+ is working on a deal to cut oil production by about 10% of world supply, or 10 million barrels per day (bpd), in what member states expect to be an unprecedented global effort.
 The countries are "very, very close" to a deal on cuts, one of Russia's top oil negotiators, Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the nation's wealth fund, told CNBC.
 But Rystad Energy's head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen said even if the group agreed to cut up to 15 million bpd, "it will only be enough to scratch the surface of the more than 23 million bpd supply overhang predicted for April 2020."
 EMERGENCY CALLS
 In currency markets, the yen fell 0.4% to 108.92 against the dollar and weakened against other major currencies as Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would declare a state of emergency as early as Tuesday to curb a spike in coronavirus infections.
 The dollar gained a little ground against the euro, but the pound recovered, having dipped 0.4% overnight after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests as he was still suffering symptoms of the coronavirus.
 Yields on safe-haven U.S. and German government bonds crept higher in fixed income markets, also reflecting the slightly brighter tone in world markets and despite some painful data.
 Investor morale in the euro zone fell to an all-time low in April and the currency bloc's economy is now in deep recession due to the coronavirus, which is "holding the world economy in a stranglehold," a Sentix survey showed.
 Orders for German-made goods had already dropped 1.4% in February, other data showed. France said it was facing its worst slump since World War Two, British car sales plunged 40% last month and Norwegian Air's traffic plummeted 60%.
 "Never before has the assessment of the current situation collapsed so sharply in all regions of the world within one month," Sentix managing director Patrick Hussy said.
 "The situation is … much worse than in 2009," Hussy said, referring to the global financial crisis. "Economic forecasts to date underestimate the shrinking process. The recession will go much deeper and longer."
 CRUCIAL TEST
 Wall Street looked eager for an early rally, with futures pointing 3.5% higher after New York, the U.S.'s biggest hot spot, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week virus-related deaths had fallen slightly.
 In Asia stocks had also proven bullish. Australia's benchmark index rose 4.3% and Japan's Nikkei added 4.25% after a slow start, while South Korea's KOSPI index climbed 3.85%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was 2.2% higher.
 That sent MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares outside of Japan up 2%, for its best performance in more than a week.
 Markets in mainland China were closed for a public holiday.
 Worryingly, the number of new coronavirus cases jumped in China on Sunday, while the number of asymptomatic cases surged too as Beijing continued to struggle to extinguish the outbreak despite drastic containment efforts.
 Singapore, which had won international praise for its handling of the virus over the last few months, had to close schools and most workplaces on Friday after it saw record jumps in new infections.
 "Focus in markets will now turn to the path out of lockdown and to what extent containment measures can be lifted without risking a second wave of infections," National Australia Bank analyst Tapas Strickland wrote in a note.
 "Key to a strong rebound in China will be the ongoing lifting of containment measures, with Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - set to lift containment measures on April 8."

Coronavirus At Sea: USS Theodore Roosevelt Captain Begs Navy To Contain Onboard Outbreak


--DocBreak--
WASHINGTON -- U.S. officials on Monday girded the country for a "peak death week" from the coronavirus pandemic as the accelerating American death toll closed the gap with Italy and Spain, the countries with the most fatalities to date.
 "It's going to be the peak hospitalization, peak ICU week and unfortunately, peak death week," Admiral Brett Giroir, a physician and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Monday.
 Giroir raised particular alarm for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Detroit, and reinforced the messaging from U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams who warned on Sunday that, "This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment."
 Confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases topped 336,000 on Sunday. The United States is by far the world leader with nearly twice as many cases as in Spain and in Italy, according to a Reuters rally of official data.
 Roughly twice as many people a day are dying in the United States versus Spain and Italy, according to the latest data. The American death roll rose by 1,144 on Sunday, pushing the total to 9,573.
 Hospitals report chaotic shortages of beds, ventilators and protective gear as patients isolated from their families die alone. Meanwhile, more than 90 percent of Americans are under stay-at-home orders issued by state governors.
 In the U.S. government's first review of the ability of hospitals to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, investigators on Monday confirmed that facilities nationwide faced "substantial challenges," including shortages of equipment and staff.
 In terms of testing and treating patients, hospitals have insufficient capacity to handle the surge, which is taking an emotional toll on doctors and nurses, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general said in a report based on 323 hospitals surveyed from March 23-27.
 "Hospitals reported that widespread shortages of PPE put staff and patients at risk," HHS inspectors said, referring to personal protective equipment. "Additionally, hospitals reported frequently waiting seven days or longer for test results," requiring them to keep patients longer and use up more critical supplies.
 GLIMMER OF HOPE
 Despite the grim warnings, at least one model offered hope that the death rate was slowing.
 The University of Washington model, one of several cited by U.S. and some state officials, now projects U.S. deaths at 81,766 by Aug. 4, down about 12,000 from a projection over the weekend.
 The model, which is frequently updated with new data, projects the peak need for hospital beds on April 15 and for daily deaths at 3,130 on April 16.
 President Donald Trump, who has oscillated between issuing dire warnings and expressing optimism that contradicts the views of his medical experts, tweeted "USA STRONG!" and "LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!" on Monday.
 Trump also defended his controversial daily news conferences as "vital," saying, "They are reaching millions of people that are not being told the truth."
 Some broadcasters have stopped airing the entire news conference live, citing the president's frequent misstatements and a shortage of new information.
 Trump has deferred to state governors for issuing stay-at-home orders.
 Eight states, all of them with governors from Trump's Republican Party, have yet to order residents to stay home: Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.
 Georgia, which has recorded 6,600 cases and more than 200 deaths, ordered residents to stay home but then allowed some beaches to reopen.
 Adams, the surgeon general, said in his Fox News appearance on Sunday that governors who had not issued month-long stay-at-home orders should at least consider one for the upcoming week.

WEST WARWICK — They may be apart, but in a performance uploaded to YouTube last week, their voices blend as if there were no distance between them.
 “It really brought tears to my eyes,” Olivia Lancellotta, a senior at West Warwick High School, recalled seeing her concert chorale’s virtual rendition of Eric Whitacre’s “The Seal Lullaby” for the first time. “I miss everyone so much, and I was just so proud of all of us.”
 Uploaded Thursday using the hashtag #wwhswizardpride, the video is a mosaic of individual recordings seamlessly layered to create a sound that rivals live music.
 The West Warwick High School Concert Chorale had planned to perform the lullaby on March 26 during an adjudicated festival at Ponaganset High School. The singers had been working for months on three pieces for the festival, which ended up canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “I felt bad not hearing them get the chance to do it,” Richard Marchetti, choral director at West Warwick High School, said Saturday. “It’s just so much hard work that was never going to get seen.”
 Marchetti was determined not to let those efforts be for nothing, however.
 “I just missed hearing their voices together,” he said of the impetus behind compiling the virtual performance. “This was just my attempt to get them to sing together and to honor their hard work.”
 The chorus from West Warwick High School last year earned the highest possible rating during the same festival, hosted by the Rhode Island American Choral Directors Association. And this year, having put months into rehearsing each song, Marchetti said he’d expected his students would perform just as well.
 “We know how much work we put in,” Jillian Marandola said Saturday. “So when we found out the event was canceled, it really just crushed us. We put so much time and effort into it, and we really do care.”
 For Lancellotta, Marandola and the other seniors who have devoted so much of their high school careers to music, Marchetti said it’s been “devastating” to have to miss some of their last opportunities to perform together.
 “It’s really crushing to all the seniors to not be able to spend their last few months together,” Marandola added.
 In addition to missing the festival, the students also on Friday had to miss Wizard Sound, the school’s annual singing competition. The high school’s spring cabaret and its jazz night, both of which had been scheduled to happen at the end of this month, will both be canceled. And performances scheduled for May, Marchetti said, will likely also not happen.
 “Even if we go back to school, which I don’t anticipate, we’re not going to be prepared,” Marchetti said.
 Rehearsing new songs remotely would be challenging, Marchetti added. While distance learning is going well, he said, factors like internet speed make it difficult to replicate choir online.
 “It’s seriously heartbreaking,” said Lancellotta, who’s been involved in West Warwick’s music programs for years. “These are things that we’ve looked forward to since we were in kindergarten.”
 Senior Isabel Losier expressed a similar sentiment.
 “It’s really sad, because I’ve been looking forward to these events for a long time,” Losier said Saturday. “It hurts a lot. I hope things get figured out and we’re able to have a few last moments together.”
 With eyes closed and volume up, it’s tough to tell that each voice in the students’ “The Seal Lullaby” rendition was recorded from a different location. Still, compiling the performance was a lot more difficult than Marchetti had anticipated.
 To bring it to fruition, Marchetti first sent each student the song’s backbeat track and asked that the singers listen to it in one ear while recording themselves singing their individual parts. They then sent the clips back to Marchetti, who used iMovie to edit them together.
 Working in between his virtual classwork, Marchetti completed the project in just over a week. One of the hardest parts of making the video, he said, was lining up every file to ensure they all started at the same time.
 Losier said she was shocked when she heard the finished piece.
 “I did not think that was possible,” she said.
 Marandola called the experience “surreal.”
 “We’re used to him playing the piano and there being other students,” she said. “It’s kind of like a movie — you don’t think this is ever going to happen until it does.”
 To be able to see and hear everyone together — even if it was only on screen — was an emotional experience for Marandola, who added that of all of her classes, honors concert chorale had been the one she most looked forward to each day.
 “To see everybody together for one last time, it really meant a lot,” she said.
 Having received so much positive feedback, Marchetti said he may at some point ask his students to contribute to another similar performance of one of the other songs they’d prepared for the festival.
 “It’s brought a lot of joy to people,” Marchetti added. “Even in this crazy, dark time, it does warm the heart a little bit.”
 And that, the performers added, is exactly what they’d hoped would happen.
 “I hope that this brings some joy,” Lancellotta said. “A lot of people are going through hard times, with jobs being lost or sickness, so I hope this can bring a light to people’s days.”
 Marandola echoed that.
 “I hope people do give it a listen,” she said. “We just hope this raises everyone’s spirits during this time.”

D-day might be upon us for Idaho high school sports, as the state’s board of education could decide today whether or not to keep schools open for the rest of the academic year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 There are two possible votes on the agenda when the Idaho State Board of Education will livestream a special meeting at 2 p.m. Pacific today. In its agenda that was posted Friday on the group’s website, it could decide to close all school buildings for the remainder of the academic year. It also could decide to extend its “soft closure” mandate it made March 24 and that continues through April 20 to a date to be determined. The “soft closure” bans buildings from being open but educators should continue distance learning and meals should be distributed to those students and families in need.
 “As the pandemic has progressed, additional models and guidance from state health officials indicate the virus is likely to peak in Idaho in late April to early May,” the materials posted on the website read. “At the time the board set (the) April 20 date, it committed to re-evaluate the timeline as the crisis developed in Idaho. The board will have the opportunity to discuss the timeline in light of the updated information as well as additional areas of consideration that have been identified during the Governor’s K-12 Emergency Council meetings.”
 What it could mean is two things for high school sports:
 If the board decides to close schools for the remainder of the academic year, that would end interscholastic activities as well for the year, which would mean all high school sports would be finished until the new academic year begins.
 If the board decides to just extend the “soft closure” to another date, the Idaho High School Activities Association could follow that mandate and push its mandatory suspension/postponement of all activities that ends April 20.
 Either way, it seems that definitive action on the spring season could be coming to a head in less than 24 hours.
 The IHSAA more than likely would follow the guidance of what the state board says in its meeting.
 On Tuesday, the IHSAA extended its suspension of all spring sports activities from April 5 to April 20. That was to fall in line with Gov. Brad Little’s stay-at-home order and the state board’s mandate of all schools remaining closed through that day.
 In Idaho, there are 1,101 reported cases of COVID-19, with 10 confirmed deaths, according to state's website on Sunday evening. According to the coronavirus.idaho.gov website, the total number of people who have been tested in the state is 10,261.
 In the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine website, the number of cases climbed to 337,620, with a total of 9,619 deaths, as of Sunday evening.
 Next door, Washington Interscholastic Activities Association executive director Mick Hoffman announced Thursday a deadline of May 4 to conduct state championships. That state’s governor, Jay Inslee, extended their stay-at-home order also to May 4. In an interview with on Thursday, WIAA sports and activities information director Casey Johnson said that the organization doesn’t want to feel like they are boxed into a certain date, but at the same time acknowledged the May 4 date probably is the last possible hope to be able to conduct spring sports state championships as is.
 Currently, spring sports state championships in Idaho are scheduled to be conducted May 14-16 for baseball, and May 15-16 for softball, tennis and track and field.

JPMorgan Chase & Co's top boss, Jamie Dimon, on Monday said he sees a "bad recession" in 2020, and that the largest U.S. bank could suspend its dividend if the coronavirus crisis deepens.
 Dimon, widely regarded as the face of the U.S. banking sector, is the most prominent voice on Wall Street so far to project that the economic cost of the coronavirus will not evaporate quickly, and said the bank's earnings will be down "meaningfully in 2020."
 But, Dimon said, even in the worst case scenario, the bank is strong and will continue lending to customers and will not need any relief from the federal government.
 JPMorgan's stock was up 5% to $84.05 in morning trading.
 JPMorgan could look at suspending dividends if gross domestic product were to fall by as much as 35% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate were to rise further to 14% in the fourth quarter of the year, the chief executive officer wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.
 Questions are mounting about whether big U.S. banks will have to cut dividends later this year as the coronavirus crisis puts a record portion of Americans out of work, making it difficult for borrowers to pay back loans.
 "If the board suspended the dividend, it would be out of extreme prudence and based upon continued uncertainty over what the next few years will bring," Dimon said.
 Dimon highlighted some challenges seen at the bank's call centers, where a handful of staff have fallen ill, customer call volumes are at record highs and local restrictions have effectively shuttered some offices.
 For customers hurt by the crisis, the bank is offering a 90-day grace period to make mortgage and auto loan payments, removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards, and waiving any late fees for those types of accounts, according to the letter.
 Dimon also said that the vast majority of the bank's 16,850 ATMs were "well- stocked and still functioning" to provide cash for customers.
 RELIEF MEASURES
 The bank said it had extended about $950 million in new loans to small businesses over the last 60 days and would still extend credit to small businesses.
 "In both our central case scenario for 2020 results and in our extremely adverse scenario, we are lending - currently or plan to do so - an additional $150 billion for our clients' needs," Dimon said.
 Even with that lending, Dimon wrote JPMorgan currently has over $500 billion in total liquid assets and $300 billion in incremental borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks.
 Dimon did not pass up the opportunity to suggest regulatory and fiscal policy reform, as he has often done in past annual letters.
 "After the crisis subsides (and it will), our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and response. And we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic system. There will be a time and place for that - but not now."
 JPMorgan will also nominate former International Business Machines Corp CEO Virginia "Ginni" Rometty for election to its board. Rometty will become the executive chairman of IBM on April 6. (Reporting by Anirban Sen in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Bernard Orr and Steve Orlofsky)

LONDON -- Oil prices fell on Monday after Saudi Arabia and Russia delayed a meeting to discuss output cuts that could help to reduce global oversupply as the coronavirus pandemic pummels demand.
 Brent crude fell more than $3 when Asian markets opened but recovered some ground, with traders hopeful a deal between the top producers was still within reach.
 At 1335 GMT, Brent was down $1.08, or 3.2%, at $33.03 a barrel. U.S. crude was $1.49, or 5.3%, lower at $26.85 a barrel, off a session low of $25.28.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are expected to meet on Thursday, instead of Monday, to discuss cutting production.
 "Perhaps it is best that the meeting was delayed for producers to cement a minimum of common ground before the actual discussions take place on Thursday," BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian said. He noted initial disappointment at the delay had driven down prices in Asian business.
 U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said that after speaking with the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia he hoped the countries will end their war over market share this week.
 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Moscow was ready to coordinate with other oil exporting countries to help stabilize the market and that the OPEC+ meeting was delayed for technical reasons.
 OPEC+ is working on a deal to cut production by about 10% of world supply, or 10 million barrels per day (bpd), in what member states expect to be an unprecedented global effort.
 But Rystad Energy's head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen said even if the group agrees to cut up to 15 million bpd, "it will only be enough to scratch the surface of the more than 23 million bpd supply overhang predicted for April 2020."
 Monday's slump in crude benchmarks came after a strong surge on April 2 and 3, with Brent gaining 38% and WTI 39.5% over the two days as the market reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump's tweets that a deal to cut output was imminent.
 Investor morale in the euro zone fell to an all-time low in April and the bloc's economy is in deep recession because of the novel coronavirus, a survey showed on Monday.
 "Wherever you look, the narrative is the same: the global economy is in a painful recession," Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said. "As OPEC+ ponders fresh supply curbs, you can't help but think that the oil market will continue to be at the mercy of the virus pandemic."
 Markets were also spooked when the National Health Commission of China said on Monday that 78 new asymptomatic cases had been identified as of the end of the day on Sunday, compared with 47 the day before.
 Asymptomatic patients, who show no symptoms but can still pass the virus to others, have become China's chief concern after strict containment measures succeeded in cutting the overall infection rate.

Those dreams came to screeching end in mid-March when the Oklahoma high school baseball season was delayed and later canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. After years of juggling schedules to catch their sons in action, high school baseball was finished in the blink of an eye.
 No senior season. No senior night celebration. No postseason chase. No more time with fellow baseball parents and their kids, with whom they had become almost like family.
 “For this to end so abruptly, it has really been tough on all of us,” Debby said.
 Suggested by a fellow Owasso baseball mother through a private Facebook group, the Wrights still found a way to honor both Zack and Josh for their years of blood, sweat and tears each had put into the sport they loved.
 Both of their high school jerseys and hats adorn the front door of the Wright’s home. Their baseball attire will remain as a shrine through May 16, originally the date of the Class 6A state championship game and final day of high school baseball in Oklahoma.
 “I thought it was a pretty cool idea to put them up there as a way to commemorate our senior season being cut short,” said Zack, who has put up his baseball cleats for good and will instead focus on academics next fall as a chemical engineering major at Oklahoma State.
 Josh will continue his baseball career in college at Southwest Christian University in Bethany. But even for McKay, the early end to his time at Union has been difficult to accept.
 “It kind of sucks,” he said. “The whole senior year only playing six games and everything getting canceled.”

Moscow School District teachers have organized a unique game for their students that aims to be safe, fun and something the community can engage in. And it involves bear hunting.
 Not actual bears, of course.
 Instead, starting this week, students and their parents are encouraged to walk around their neighborhoods and look for a stuffed bear or picture of a bear in the windows and yards of the community.
 Kathy Stefani, a music teacher at McDonald Elementary, helped organize the activity that starts today. She said it was inspired by the children’s book, “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt,” by Michael Rosen.
 The game has taken off globally, and now the school district is asking community members to take part. Stefani said it seemed appropriate to do it in Moscow, given that a bear is Moscow High School’s mascot.
 “We can connect through the whole community rather than just students and teachers,” she said.
 This was one of the many ideas formed by teachers trying to help keep students busy outside the classroom, Stefani said. Since schools closed in response to COVID-19, she said, teachers have been brainstorming activities to make this a “less scary time” for the children.
 Stefani said it is not a graded assignment, nor is it required.
 “It’s an option should they choose to do it,” she said.
 The organizers hope everyone will get in on the game
 “We’d like to particularly feature the MHS seniors, asking them to make big displays, perhaps a collage of themselves, Bear Pride bling, picture of a mortar board, etc., in front of their homes,” Stefani wrote in an email to the Daily News. “The elementary students will be asked to find the “senior bears.”
 Moscow Middle School students and businesses are also being asked to display bears at their houses and storefronts.
 Stefani said the “Bear Hunt” still allows for social distancing, is a family activity and can benefit the children socially and emotionally.

Although investment opportunities are always plentiful, you need to have a willingness to take decisive action with an overwhelming sense of self- assurance. Moreover, you must be able to stay the course despite the consternation of others.
   
 To paraphrase words from a Rudyard Kipling poem, can you keep your head when all about you are losing theirs -- and blaming you? Can you trust yourself when all men doubt you?
   
 Having watched the last part of the movie, "Titanic" recently, I could not help but draw an analogy between the panic that likely swept the ship in real life as passengers began to fathom the fate that was awaiting them, and the near panic that has ensued among many as a result of the Coronavirus.
   
 Psychologists will probably agree that anytime a calamity strikes social mores break down in a variety of ways. Some refute the obvious, such as those that partied in defiance of an approaching hurricane ... only to have the building wash away along with its inhabitants.
   
 Others recognize that as dangerous as a threat may be, it too will pass and thereby take proper precautions to live and fight another day. Unfortunately, irrationality grips others, thereby resulting in less than favorable outcomes.
   
 The performance of the markets recently has resulted in investors having to come to terms with the potential perils of investing and the unpredictability of market returns. Furthermore, a recent study of pandemics found the associated shocks typically weigh on wages and investment for years to come.
   
 The Coronavirus has meant an abrupt halt to most economic activity that has yet to reach its peak. The second quarter will bring a contraction rivaling the steepest in history and could transcend even the Great Recession.
   
 The financial markets are path dependent. A seemingly "temporary" pullback in the S&P; 500 has a wealth effect which can cause deleveraging and a reduction in consumer spending, possibly triggering further defaults and impairing supply chains and raising costs. The end result is that equities look less attractive.
   
 Yet, this is not a repeat of the Great Recession. That was a liquidity crisis that threatened the financial system. Central banks have ensured the necessary liquidity this time around.
   
 The Great Depression resulted from errors in government policy that compounded the real economic impact of a markets crash. Government policy has begun to respond in an effectual manner this time around.
   
 Nonetheless, insulating small- and medium-sized businesses from default is not as simple as the government guaranteeing some degree of bank-lending. It takes time for any stimulus to feed through the system, which could be detrimental to those who are most vulnerable.
   
 The result may well be negative outcomes. Finally, earnings season will likely cause another round of pain. Less than exemplary earnings, reduced dividends and negative pronouncements will do little to encourage investors.
   
 Amongst the doom and gloom there are always points of light. Previous columns have illuminated Walmart and Church & Dwight as being possible ports in a storm. This week's point of light is Abbott Labs (ABT).
   
 Abbott Laboratories' shares surged in price recently after the company unveiled a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes. The equipment and is so small and portable it can be used in almost any health-care environment.
   
 Abbott plans to supply 50,000 tests a day starting April 1, having received emergency authorization for use by accredited laboratories and patient care settings.
   
 The technology builds on Abbott's ID Now platform, the most common point-of- care test currently available with more than 18,000 units spread across the country. It is widely used to detect influenza, strep throat and respiratory syncytial virus, a common bug that causes cold-like symptoms.
   
 The equipment can be set up almost anywhere, but the company is working to ensure the equipment sent to it is are most needed, specifically hospital emergency rooms, urgent-care clinics and doctors' offices.

Bloomberg) -- As the coronavirus pandemic penetrates more deeply into global supply chains, prices for key staples are starting to soar in some parts of the world.
 Rice and wheat -- crops that account for about a third of the world's calories -- have been making rapid climbs in spot and futures markets. For countries that rely on imports, this is creating an added financial burden just as the pandemic shatters their economies and erodes their purchasing power. In Nigeria, for example, the cost of rice in retail markets soared by more than 30% in the last four days of March alone.
 It's unclear what the biggest drivers were for the retail prices, whether it was a trickle-down effect from grain futures or local logistical choke points or panic buying, or a combination.
 What is clear is that, while the world isn't about to run out of food anytime soon, anxiety over policy makers' ability to deliver it to the right place at the right time and at the right price is mounting.
 "Without the coronavirus, there would not be any problem whatsoever," said Stefan Vogel, head of agricultural commodity research at Rabobank International. "People are getting worried about the supply chain."
 Most price measures in the broader economy at the moment are moving things in a different direction. There are concerns over deflation as the pandemic shutters businesses, sparks unemployment and unravels the oil market. In fact, a gauge of global food costs fell sharply last month, primarily a ripple effect from the energy plunge which cripples demand for crops like sugar that get turned into biofuels.
 However, food prices don't move uniformly around the world. Even within that broader drop, some critical staples were outliers. Rice posted a third straight monthly increase.
 While global grain inventories have been plentiful for several years, the response to the virus is unleashing ripple effects making it harder for staples to get where they're needed and helping drive the price gains. That's happening at the same time that demand has spiked with people loading their pantries while they stay home as much as possible.
 Adding to the pressure, countries including Russia, Kazakhstan and Vietnam are moving to secure domestic supply by restricting exports that the world depends on.
 The result? Export prices for rice from Thailand, the world's second-biggest shipper, are at a six-year high. Wheat futures in Chicago, the global benchmark, shot up more than 8% in March, while Canadian durum, the type of grain used in pasta and couscous, is at the highest since August 2017.
 There are also signs that price gains could be making their way to consumers for some foods in the U.S. Wholesale egg prices rose to a record as grocers boosted orders by as much as six times normal volumes. Beef also surged, though some of the gains have eased in the last week.
 Wheat and rice are the world's most consumed food crops. Staple-crop prices have a long history of fueling political instability. During the spikes of 2011 and 2008, there were food riots in more than 30 nations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
 To be clear, it's likely the supply disruptions could prove temporary. And that will probably mean that wheat and rice will stabilize. In the last several years, food costs have been relatively benign thanks to plentiful supplies. Global rice and wheat reserves are both projected at all-time highs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 But in the meantime, higher prices seen in recent weeks could hit countries that are more sensitive to fluctuations. That's especially true for nations where food makes up a bigger part of overall household budgets, and it puts the world's most vulnerable in further risk. Virus-related effects are also exacerbating price gains where food inflation was already an issue.
 And it's not just staple crops rising. Prices of fruit and vegetables, essential in providing nutrition, are also going up in many parts of the world.
 In Nigeria, stay-at-home orders from state governments have sparked panic buying. Snarled transportation means fewer goods are getting to markets and grocery stores, and inventories are depleting, said Saudat Salami, who owns an online food retailer in Lagos. Some traders in the food markets where she get supplies have also been afraid to stay in operation as the virus spreads, she said.
 Rikotu Isah, a rice farmer from Kebbi, the country's largest producing state, said there haven't been significant problems with this year's crop yet, since the harvest just started.
 "But if restrictions on movement persist and we can't transport our produce to the market, there will likely be a shortage in the market that will affect prices," he said.
 Governments are working overtime to keep prices stable and inflation under wraps.
 Algeria, Turkey and Tunisia have already stepped up their wheat purchases in recent weeks to secure supplies. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have said they will be boosting grain reserves. The Philippines is allocating more than $600 million for food sufficiency efforts and plans to buy 300,000 tons of rice.
 Not everyone expects that government intervention can keep things under control, though.
 Lalatendu Rath runs a small grocery store in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. He shut his shop for safety reasons as cases mount in the nation. Local authorities are controlling prices for essential commodities including food, but he has bought about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of potatoes, or about three months worth of his household's needs.
 "There is no guarantee if prices of staples will remain stable," he said. "It's better to buy a little more than the normal requirement, as we have children in the family to feed."
 Overall food prices are still well below the peaks from 2008 and 2011 amid the big stockpiles. The oil slump should also help keep costs down for farmers, which tends to put a lid on crop prices.
 But food-importing nations are also up against a surging U.S. dollar, which makes commodities more expensive for importers. The dollar is the most expensive ever against the Algerian dinar, and near a record against the Saudi riyal and Indonesian rupiah.
 Climate change is also a major factor in the outlook. Drought has recently plagued rice crops in Thailand and Vietnam. In Australia, years of dryness have reduced vegetable plantings and sparked some shortages. If this year's global wheat harvest sees problems, that could prompt more countries to place limits on exports and spark further price gains.
 The virus also hasn't yet spread widely in places with food insecurity, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. If it does, there's a chance that harvests will shrink, food prices will spike and more people will go hungry, the Agricultural Market Information System, a G20 initiative, said.
 "All bets are off the table right now," said Neil Townsend, an analyst at FarmLink in Winnipeg, Manitoba. "Food security is going to be a big issue."

The upcoming “OPEC+ and Friends” meeting is going to be a very tricky one. There is the very real possibility of the meeting failing as the targets that have been set are totally unclear. Saudi Arabia, probably supported by Abu Dhabi, called an emergency meeting, not only of OPEC+ members but of all oil- producing nations. That means that, at least according to Western media, the US is invited and will likely attend. In inviting the U.S., it seems that Saudi Arabia has called Trump’s bluff because by attending the meeting Washington will be implicitly stating that a possible production cut agreement would include the US. When looking at the US upstream oil and gas sector there is one thing you can state without any analysis….Washington and US oil and gas operators are not on the same page. Suggestions of Washington being able to control or even force US oil to cut production, even via legislation, are ludicrous and would end in a mammoth legal battle. Even if only Texas representatives attend, oil companies will be unlikely to comply, it is simply not in the US oil and gas DNA to work together on an international level. Free market economics is a cornerstone of U.S. society and business.

The Wrights are one of several parents of Owasso baseball seniors who have joined in the movement to display their sons’ jerseys. Dana Ackenhausen, mother of pitcher/first baseman Nate Ackenhausen, had come across a similar tribute from baseball mothers in another part of the country through social media and brought the idea up other Owasso parents.
 Families of Owasso seniors in other spring sports have joined in the tribute as well.
 “The baseball community around Tulsa is very tight in the surrounding areas,” Dana Ackenhausen said. “A lot of the boys play each other during the summer and throughout the year. We thought this would be a great way to honor them.”
 Owasso was originally scheduled to travel to Florida over spring break, but that trip was canceled with out-of-state travel already strongly discouraged due to the outbreak. Shortly after, Oklahoma public schools – and by extension spring sports – were postponed for three weeks beginning on March 16. Ten days later, the Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activities Association officially announced the spring season was shut down.
 Kristi Russell placed the jersey of her senior, Owasso first baseman Gabe Russell, on the front door of their home.
 A premature ending his senior year were particularly difficult circumstances for Gabe, who had spent the offseason rehabilitating from a fracture in his back. Gabe transferred back to Owasso prior to his junior year after spending three years at Rejoice Christian Schools.
 “With the passion for this kid has for this game, it’s a small thing to do,” Kristi said of her son, who has signed to play college baseball at NEO. “When you finally feel like you’ve got a place you feel like you belong, it’s one of those things that has been very disappointing.”
 While Dana Ackenhausen is fully aware the catastrophic impact left by the global pandemic could make the cancelation of a sports season seem insignificant, it doesn’t make things easier for a parent as they see something their child loves taken away prematurely.
 “You hate to feel sad for yourself when there is something bigger going on in the world and people are dying,” Ackenhausen said. “But it’s more than just baseball. It’s more than just graduation. It’s those last time memories.
 “It’s the ending you don’t know.”

Not for a long time have we appreciated our homes as much as we do now. At least since World War II, the home has meant little more than a tool with which to build equity and lay claim to an economic stake in the market. Sure, many have done their best to turn what is otherwise a cold aspect of daily life into a warm and loving possession, but the fact remains that only a fraction of our homes have been designed with us in mind.
 Social media have had their own impact on the home, replacing it as the environment through which we cultivate friendships and develop community. This is not the place to delve into that topic, only suffice it to say that with every post we put up in virtual space another goes down in real space. Until one day soon we will run the risk of bringing the whole house down, figuratively speaking.
 And so we have just made do, resigned to the blessing that we have a roof over our heads and a bathroom that functions well. But also the idea that a home is nothing more than an abstract box to which we return every day to make the next day possible. If it has personality it comes courtesy of big box stores, such as Walmart and Target.
 The coronvirus may be changing that narrative. In forcing us to retreat back to our domestic settings it has also forced us to reexamine the complex relations between identity and space. In Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting across town, nation and world, it may have finally awakened us to the realization that our interiors are more than what they seem. More than storage units into which we stuff needless acquisitions, they are platforms from which to broadcast dear personal values.
 For so long we had divided the world into two enclaves, the home on one side and the office on the other. And perhaps for a good reason, namely to protect ourselves from unwelcome judgment, and perhaps the feeling that no one cared. What did it matter that our interior walls were blank and nondescript, our dining tables forgettable, window sills plain and painfully soulless. No one was going to see them anyway.
 Not today. Today we are all weaving in and out of each other’s places, becoming privy to realities we never knew about each other, friends and colleagues. Who knew that Sam who had been sitting there for 20 years doing a fine job teaching economics, was also an avid collector of North African art. In a recent Zoom encounter, she had sat in front of her favorite piece, a painting by the Libyan artist Ali Omar Ermes, featuring the visual lyricism of the Arabic alphabet.
 The image is specifically of “meem,” an Arabic letter whose equivalent in English is the letter M. A discussion ensues, about travel, the art of language and a part of the world that remain somewhat unknown to the west. How nice.
 Indeed, if there is one positive message that has come out of the last couple of months it is our connectivity, or more specifically that we like to connect and know more about each other. One day the physical isolation will yield and it will be critical to see how we return to normal life. There will be a lot to think about. In the meantime, let’s not let our newfound love of domestic space go undeveloped.
 Repainting, rearranging and generally rethinking interior space will be one thing; another will be how we may take this opportunity, once all is said and done, to reopen our homes, and welcome people in. Neighbors and friends, but also those colleagues on whom we have relied for so long. Perhaps the two go hand in hand, sprucing our interiors not just for the fun of creating a fresh start, but precisely for the important new realization that people love to share our spaces and know more about us.
 The virus has been debilitating but it has also restored few good values long lost in the course of modernity. Let’s take that and build a better future with it.
