Lamorne Morris, who was never not funny as Winston Bishop in “New Girl,” has a new show, “Woke,” in which he takes center stage. Premiering Wednesday on Hulu, it is inspired by the life and work of comics artist Keith Knight (“The K Chronicles,” “The Knight Life”), who created the show with Marshall Todd (“Barbershop”), and it’s a mutually good fit for actor and series — smart, likable, a little weird, hard to pin down.
 A largely successful mix of genres and themes — some romance, some wacky cohabitation comedy and some social satire, regarding identity, authenticity, justice, performative rage and real exhaustion — “Woke” does sometimes go just where you might expect, but more often does not. Set in and more than usually about San Francisco (represented by stock shots, a drag queen and Vancouver, Canada), it is timely enough that the novel coronavirus is mentioned — production wrapped at the end of February — but not so timely that more than one person is seen wearing a mask.
 The epigram that begins the series, “Inspired by one experience… shared by many,” suggests that we are going to see something of broad social import but that “one experience” matters as much as “shared by many,” if not more. “Woke” is political, but not polemical — a conversation, not a sermon. And if it is a story about race, it’s also one of a more or less reasonable person in a world of knuckleheads, trying to make sense of himself.
 Morris plays Keef, the Knight stand-in, creator of a locally published popular comic strip called “Toast-n-Butter” that is about to go into syndication. He is ready to move up and move out of the apartment he shares with Clovis (T. Murph) and Gunther (Blake Anderson) and into a condominium with his lawyer girlfriend, and if you have seen television before, you know that this is not going to happen. Home is where the wacky best friends are. Clovis gets by reselling limited-edition sneakers and approaches women with tired pickup lines and absurd lies. (This sounds bad on paper; his character fills out in practice.) As Gunther, Anderson is not far from the spacey stoner he played on “Workaholics,” though he has more dimension here, more plausibility. We meet him trying to sell his roommates on investing in a new waterless “energy drink” that is basically cocaine.

BRISTOL -- A co-president of the Bristol Warren Education Association said in an email that a Bristol teacher recently testing positive for the coronavirus is an example of why the association has been advocating for the school district to continue with distance learning for the beginning of the year and gradually begin in-person learning as conditions become safer.
 Responding to a reporter's question about a teacher testing positive, association co-president Michelle Way DaSilva wrote that she could not discuss specifics of the case, but that it exemplifies concerns her group has had for months.
 "What we can say is that this is surely a sign of things to come," she wrote. "Once schools open up with any form of in-person teaching, we expect to see many more cases and more disruptions to our district schools because of it."
 Bristol Warren Regional School District Superintendent Jonathan Brice did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.
 DaSilva wrote that she believes the district administration has taken measures to protect the health and safety of students and staff. But, she said she thinks that members of the school community should not be expected to return until they have proof that it will be safe, even in buildings full of young students.
 "To accomplish this enormous task, our School Committee needs to acknowledge that our students are children, and will therefore behave as children do; generally, children are often unpredictable and are not always cognizant of the potential consequences of their actions," she wrote. "It is the job of every adult to do what we can to protect them, starting with the School Committee."
 In a back-to-school letter posted to the district's website at the end of August, Brice wrote that the school was preparing to reopen either in person, with distance learning, or in a hybrid mode and that the administration would be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances.
 Last week, Gov. Gina Raimondo said that all districts in the state have the "green light" to open for full in-person learning, except for Providence and Central Falls because of high positive test rates. However some districts, such as Cumberland, have opted to open the school year with distance learning, while others, such as Warwick, have chosen to bring some students back and others will learn remotely.

Building on Timmons’ comments on 2016, Masterson said, “there’s a huge difference between 2016, 2018, and today and that has to do with the community that’s come together.” That community – CISA, the FBI, state and local governments, and the private sector – have focused on improving information sharing and building situational awareness. “The landscape today compared to 2016 is so different, it really is night and day,” he said.

The strength of the series is that the characters ultimately speak for themselves. They remain individuals, imperfectly aligned even with their own stated agendas. And Morris has an everyman, leading man charm that keeps Keef appealing when he runs off course. A lot of this has to do with well-written dialogue that is allowed to wander off a point. Especially well handled is Keef’s tentative relationship with Adrienne (Rose McIver), an artist he meets on the rebound. They have a real couple’s relaxed chemistry, though they are not quite a couple. But this richness holds for the rest of the cast and their sometimes surprising connections as well.
 The series, which in its more surreal moments recalls left-of-center satires from half a century ago, like Jules Feiffer’s “Little Murders” or Robert Downey Sr.'s “Putney Swope,” gets weird quickly, then gets a little less weird — the talking things quiet down for awhile, before Keith David wakes things up as the voice of the Holy Bible — then gets weird in a different way, before coming to a season ending that could easily serve as a series ending. It feels conclusive, if open-ended; decisions have been taken, characters developed, Keef enters a new phase in his relationship to the world. I’m not saying I wouldn’t like a second helping, though new seasons sometimes just unwind the progress of the characters to keep things “interesting.” But I felt satisfied.

Both the photos and the cosplays themselves came out looking incredible, as if the characters were lifted right out of the game. Heck, you wouldn't be laughed at for mistaking this for game art rather than just a photo of two cosplayers paying homage.
 This isn't the first of maul's cosplays to make waves, with some brilliant looks taken from the likes of Assassin's Creed and Borderlands 3's Zane.
 If you're looking for great gaming cosplays, maul and msskunk might be one of the best places to look, since their attention to detail is sublime.

 ## FIFA 21 highest OVR players predictions
 EA SPORTS Many fans would like to see Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski lead the way in FIFA 21 player ratings.
 The first batch of players don't really set a benchmark for OVR ratings, in all honesty. If one of them would have been around an 86, then it would be easier to predict the highest and those just below that level.
 That being said, efforts from the last season of football can be a great guide for predicting player ratings. Below, we've compiled a short list of the top world stars and predicted how their Ultimate Team cards will shape up.
