Similarly, the President of the National Association of Resident Doctors, Dr. Aliyu Sokomba, said it seemed obvious that the Federal Government of Nigeria was not interested in the health sector, describing the health budget as "too meagre" and "very insignificant". That is why they seek healthcare outside this country. They know that all the fundamentals of a functional health system are lacking in this country, so the health system cannot function. What is more amazing is how Nigerians have come to terms with this reality that they are doomed and they do not have a functional government to cater to health sector."

I’m going to try to describe to you the general vibe of Drew McIntyre. Drew McIntyre is a WWE Superstar. Hundreds of millions of people know this, but many others do not. This is the nature of World Wrestling Entertainment Superstardom – and Drew McIntyre is cheerfully resigned to it. He looks heavy, physically, as though it would take six or seven men – normal men – or eight or nine little weaklings like me, to lift him. Drew McIntyre could lift himself up, though, because he has the raw power of an industrial digger. He’s lounging on a sofa in front of me, pre-lockdown, a steak dinner lingering just behind him. And though he is unfailingly polite – thoughtful and sincere with just a crispy little burnt crust of humour round the edges – he does give off the energy, palpably, that he could toss the sofa he’s sitting on up in the air like a baseball and headbutt it through the adjacent wall. He is at once capable of tenderly nuzzling a small puppy and kicking someone’s head through a pub urinal – and that’s what makes him such a captivating superstar. He is hard and soft. He is meat and iron. There’s a lot going on with him.

Numerous Alamance County residents, organized by the Alamance Makers Guild, are coming together to make face shields, cloth masks and N95 mask covers for the county's hospitals and first responders.
   
 Bennett Harris, founder of the Makers Guild, estimated about 200 people are involved in the collective effort thus far, with 45 3D printers in use and several laser printers and sewers involved.
   
 Lee Atkinson, another member of the Makers Guild, is largely responsible for the idea to pull local makers together on this project, Harris said.
   
 "We've been working on this project through the Alamance County Makers Guild for a few weeks now," he said. "We had a meeting with Cone Health earlier this week, and they have now given the go-ahead."
   
 STEAM Junction in Burlington, The Forge Makerspace in Greensboro, Elon University's Maker Hub and Alamance Community College are primary partners in the effort, but individuals throughout the county with their own 3D printers, laser cutters or sewing machines also are getting involved.
   
 The collective has already produced N95 mask covers for the Burlington Fire Department. "That extend the lifetime of an N95 mask," Harris said.
   
 Mebane City Council member Sean Ewing is working with his own 3D printer to make the mask covers for the Mebane Police Department as part of the collective.
   
 "We're working initially to make 1,000 face shields for Cone Health, possibly with more after that depending on what their needs are," Harris said.
   
 Several residents are sewing cloth masks, which can be used for secondary healthcare personnel rather than front-line doctors and nurses.
   
 "We've started to give some out to downtown Burlington businesses like restaurants that are doing delivery so there is a degree of protection for folks they interact with," Harris said of the cloth masks.
   
 Completed equipment will be donated in batches of 100 to 200 as it becomes available.
   
 To ensure their own health and safety, Harris said, the makers are working as individually as possible and gathering in groups of three or fewer with adequate social distancing to assemble the face shields, N95 mask covers and cloth masks when needed.
   
 "It's difficult because under normal times, we would all get together at STEAM Junction or at Elon's Makerspace or other spaces … and do this, but every social contact is a risk for the virus, so we're working remotely and in a distributed way. Thankfully we have individual resources throughout the community," he said.
   
 "There's other things we can do down the road," Harris added. "In the Makers Guild and at STEAM Junction, we have retired electrical engineers, we have folks that repair machinery. We got a request from the hospital. Apparently they have several older machines with dead batteries, and as a result the machines won't function. … So Mark Smith [a STEAM Junction member] is working to source batteries for these machines.
   
 "There's all kinds of side efforts going on and all kinds of potential as well," he said.
   
 "We don't want to come across like we're heroes or anything. We're just trying to respond," Harris said. "This is the real value of having a makerspace in our community. … That creates this sort of micro-manufacturing industry in our community to respond to something like this."
   
 Harris said the Makers Guild also has launched a statewide effort to encourage makers across North Carolina to get involved in helping their communities.
   
 "We've started a Google Form that folks from all over the state can register to say 'Hey, I have a 3D printer or I can sew or I have other resources that could go toward solving the problem in my community.' The goal is to network people together, connect people with needs to people who can solve them," Harris said.
   
 This form also will become a resource for local makers to get involved with the collective or as a means to direct excess supplies to other communities in need after the local demand has been met.
   
 "If we fill the need in our community with face shields or others, we can send those extras off to other places like New York City or Charlotte or wherever might need them more," he said.
   
 Getting involved
   
 The Alamance Makers Guild is a nonprofit organization, which means they can accept financial donations to purchase supplies or to reimburse individual makers for supplies already purchased, Harris said.
   
 "We are doing this so nobody makes any profit off doing it," Harris explained.
   
 While other makers in the county are encouraged to join the collective, nonmakers also are able to help. Harris said financial donation or supply donations are welcome, but donors are asked to contact the Makers Guild first to find out what is needed most at that time.
   
 Donations of large space for assembly points and other resources also are needed.
   
 "If everybody suddenly donates money, we may have more money than we need locally for supplies," he explained. "We can sort of advise them, 'Yes, we still have an ongoing need' or 'No, we've got everything we need' or 'Please give your money somewhere else where there is a need, like lunches for kids who can't go to school or whatever else it is.'"
   
 To find out what makers need, email ben.harris@steamjunction.com.
   
 "What we're doing here is going on all over the country. It's a stop-gap measure until the supply chain can be restored to bring in tested, certified equipment," Harris said. "It's our hope that we get a call from the hospital tomorrow saying 'The supply chain is stable. We've got 10,000 coming in tomorrow, and we don't need you anymore.'"

In one of his first acts as board chair, Palm nominated Callaway ag producer and restaurateur Jim Jenkins to join the board. Jenkins accepted and the board has approved his appointment.
 Jenkins has 35 years of experience in agriculture and the food industry. He is the operating partner for his family’s diversified farming, ranching, and cattle feeding operation, as well as the founder of Skeeter Barnes restaurant in Kearney. Jenkins was also the founder of the Whiskey Creek steakhouse chain.
 “Having worked with Jim Jenkins through Blueprint Nebraska over the last three years, I think he brings a valuable perspective and experience to our board,” said Palm.
 Jenkins currently serves as chair of the Blueprint Nebraska Entrepreneurship Council, on the Agriculture Builders of Nebraska board of directors, and is a board member of the Callaway Hospital.
 In addition, he is a past chairman of the Nebraska Ethanol Board; a past board member of the Nebraska Grazing Lands Coalition; former executive director of the Nebraska Corn-Fed Beef program; served for nine years on the Custer County Planning Commission; is a past president of the Nebraska Restaurant Association, and is a past member of the President’s Advisory Council at the University of Nebraska.
 In 2000, Jenkins was presented with the Champion of Small Business Award from the University of Nebraska Business Development Center.
 “None of my friends would ever refer to me as a conservative, but all of them know I am an enthusiastic supporter of the free enterprise system,” said Jim Jenkins. “I’m joining the Platte Institute because of its thoughtful, nonpartisan approach to efforts for property tax reform and taking down barriers for entrepreneurs. I’ve started a few businesses that have not worked out, and especially in light of the current recession, we can’t afford to take entrepreneurship for granted or see entrepreneurship through a lens of excessive partisanship.”

Valentino Rossi has won nine Moto GP titles, the third highest number in history
 When I was watching Rossi as a kid, I myself was racing motocross and was pretty good. I was competing in the Scottish Championships and getting top three finishes out of fields of 40 guys. I was doing quite well but we just didn't have the money to keep it going and stay competitive with the top guys who had sponsorships, two bikes plus spares. If we crashed that was us, we were out.
 I had one particularly nasty crash when I came flying off my bike and did my back in, my liver, my kidneys, everything. I was coughing and peeing blood for a couple of days, it wasn't good, but it didn't faze me at all. I was injured for a couple of weeks and a bit sore, but as soon as I was able to get back out on the bike I did. I just loved it.
 To this day I don't really think there's anything, aside from being in the boxing ring, that comes close to that adrenaline rush you get on the bike. The feeling of the speed and doing the jumps, it's incredible. You just can't get enough, you just want to do it more and more. You know the dangers, but when you're on it the bike the danger doesn't even enter your head. You're just enjoying the bike and enjoying the thrill of being on it.
 I still have a motorbike but it's almost three years since I've been out on it. I can't risk falling off and ending my boxing career too soon. The last time I went on it I was going down the road with my friend, who was on his bike as well, and we had a couple of close calls with car drivers not paying attention. After that I put the bike away and I thought it's not worth risking my career for. I can still go and watch racing and enjoy it that way.
 And when the day comes when I hang up my boxing gloves, I'll be straight back out on the bike. Who knows, maybe one day I'll get to meet Valentino Rossi and he can give me some pointers. I'd love that. I never really get star struck but I think I would be if I met him. I don't know what I would say.

It also provides a description and artistic illustration of 11-year-old Ogallala, which still celebrates its mid-1870s to mid-1880s heyday as the trail’s terminus.
 The magazine’s sender apparently had no local ties, said Taylor Stone, social media and tourism coordinator for the Ogallala chamber.
 “It was just like ‘I came across this, and here you go,’” she said.
 “It was super out of the blue. But it was a great piece of mail to get, especially with these (COVID-19) times right now.”
 The American Agriculturist article, which carries no byline, generally tracks with what local, Nebraska and Old West historians have written about the Texas Trail and Ogallala.
 But it doesn’t show up in available print and online source lists. And it indicates that cattle began arriving in Ogallala in large numbers a year before the trail’s first known busy year in 1875.
 “In 1874, the first year that Ogalalla was made the terminus of the drive, fifty thousand head of cattle reached here,” it says, using the late 1800s-early 1900s spelling of the city’s name with its double-L at the end instead of the middle.
 “Last year, 1877, eighty thousand arrived. The number of cattle brought here this year (1878) and distributed to the ranchmen, is computed at one hundred and twenty thousand. ...
 “After the ranchmen have kept the cattle on their northern ranges for a year or more, they ship them to the Chicago market and make their profit on them.”
 Historian Vance Nelson of Ogallala, former curator of the Fort Robinson Museum and a Keith County Historical Society member, called the 1878 piece “a very, very important article for several reasons.”
 Besides assering an earlier start to Ogallala’s trailhead period, he said, it suggests the Texas Trail supplied not only eastern markets but also the Oglala and Brulé Lakota bands being supplied by federal cattle buyers at the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail agencies in northern Nebraska.
 “I’m just overwhelmed by it,” Nelson said. “I call it a miracle document.”
 The Keith County seat near Lake McConaughy has actively promoted itself as “The End of the Texas Trail” since the runup to Nebraska’s centennial celebration in 1967.
 Front Street, which opened in 1964, memorializes the trail era’s Crystal Palace and Cowboy’s Rest saloons. Boot Hill, which once held the graves of early settlers and cowboys who met unfortunate ends, sits north of downtown.

Ahead of extending restrictions on the mobility of goods and persons, the government plans to set up a chain of 20 lakh retail shops called 'Suraksha Stores' across India which will provide daily essentials to citizens while maintaining stringent safety norms. The Suraksha Stores initiative will convert the neighbourhood kirana stores into sanitised retail outlets selling daily essentials while adhering to safety norms such as social distancing and sanitisation to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. The government will rope in private firms to implement this plan, which seeks to ensure that proper protocol is followed in the entire supply chain, right from manufacturing units to retail outlets, to combat COVID-19. Consumer Affairs Secretary Pawan Kumar Agarwal has held at least one round of discussions with the top FMCG companies to implement this ambitious plan through public private partnership, the sources said. The government is targeting to earmark 20 lakh retail outlets as 'Suraksha Stores' over the next 45 days. Each FMCG company might be given one or two states to execute this plan in an effective manner and enable every store to fight coronavirus. When contacted, Agarwal said the government is "working" on the 'Suraksha Store' plan but declined to share any detail. To become a 'Suraksha Store', a retail store will have to comply with a health and safety checklist, which includes social distancing of 1.5 metres outside the shop as well as billing counters, use of sanitiser or handwash by consumers before entering shops, provision of masks to all staff and sanitisation of high touch areas twice a day. The 'Suraksha Store' will not only be for groceries but also consumer durables, apparel and salons. A top official at a leading FMCG firm confirmed the development. "The government is planning to create Suraksha Store and Suraksha Circle to ensure hygiene and safety norms across the supply chain. More than 50 top FMCG companies have been approached. We are with the government and we have already given our approval to actively participate in this exercise," said the official, who wished not to be identified. FMCG companies will be asked to provide training and mobilise health kits (masks, gloves and sanitisers) to enable retail outlets to become 'Suraksha Stores', the official said, adding that big industries would similarly help wholesalers and other smaller units. As per the plan, each retail outlet will have to prominently display that it is a 'Suraksha Store' to customers. Educational posters related to hygiene and safety should also be displayed in the store. Similarly, the Consumer Affairs Ministry is working on creating 'Suraksha Circle' where lead manufacturing plants will help their business partners and smaller factories in their vicinity in order to ensure a safe environment across the product supply chain. Each lead manufacturing plant is expected to adopt 10 SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and one village in order to achieve the target to bring 50,000 SMEs and 5,000 communities under Suraksha Circle. According to the plan, an online training certification programme will be created for Suraksha Stores and Suraksha Circle to ensure awareness about COVID-19 protocols for the supply of essential commodities as per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

In the midst of McIntyre’s WWE wilderness, he was dropped on his head during a match, fracturing two of his vertebrae and confined to a brace for eight weeks. Injuries for wrestlers, though a natural part of the game, can be devastating. If you can’t wrestle, you can’t work. Perilous contracts can fall through while in rehabilitation, long-planned storylines fizzle out and a fickle wrestling crowd forgets who you are. McIntyre’s neck break threatened his comeback. But while he was supposed to be on a sofa letting his neck fuse back together, he was still out drinking, partying and seeing friends. McIntyre’s wife, Kaitlyn Frohnapfel – who he met six months before his WWE release, and who “hates wrestling” – told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to cut out the drinking. “And she was 100% right. I realised I didn’t look as good as I should. I started looking into diet. I started working with a meal-plan company and I cut out the partying. When I came back from the neck break, my physique had changed completely. I looked better than I’d ever looked. And I was back in WWE within three months.”

Here in America we were familiar with the name Weatherby. Roy Weatherby was the rifle maker for the famous. Clients included John Wayne, Jimmy Doolittle, Joe Foss, Roy Rogers, Gary Cooper to name a few. This was back in the day when political correctness had not stripped manliness from our culture.
 While England Firearm Company did supply rifles to Europe’s elite, they definitely had a more colloquial cliental. They carried these rifles to all parts of the globe and harvested all manner of medium-sized game on every continent.
 In time, the .275 Rigby became very popular with hunters. It may be one of the best deer and antelope cartridges ever created. Even Jack O’Conner, the famed gun writer from the 1950s to the 1970s, who pioneered hunting just about anything that moved with a Winchester .270, loved the .275 Rigby as well.
 However, the .275 Rigby will forever be associated with Walter Dalyrmple Maitland “Karamojo” Bell and John Rigby & Sons rifles. Bell was one of the greatest ivory hunters to walk the plains of Africa. Karamojo Bell earned his moniker because of his safaris and exploits in the then remote wilderness of north Eastern Uganda during the golden years of the ivory trade.
 Bell loved the .275 Rigby and was a superb marksman. He became famous for perfecting the brain shot on elephants. He dissected the skulls of each elephant he killed and made a careful study of its anatomy. He became so familiar with the anatomy of the elephant’s skull that he could accurately predict the path of a bullet fired from any angle in order to reach the brain.
 Bell took 1,011 elephants in his career with his .275 Rigby; a caliber that some hunters may consider only moderate for white-tailed deer.
 Not only did Bell hunt elephants, he also hunted just about every other game animal of the African plains, not for sport, but to feed all the people involved on his safaris. That number could be from 75 to 100 people at a time, depending on how many supplies they needed to carry and how long the safari would be. That required a lot of meat and Bell’s .275 Rigby supplied it.
 Another rifle that Bell was fond of and carried with him was a British Enfield chambered in the famous .303 cartridge. This was the standard rifle and cartridge for the British Army for over 100 years.

Motorbikes are my first love. I've been around bikes my whole life thanks to my dad. He used to race and there are pictures of me as a newborn at the track. Dad raced at club level for a few years, at Knockhill in the Scottish Championship and at East Fortune in East Lothian. He did that for a few seasons, but when I came along he had a choice - either buy a box of nappies or a set of tyres for his bike. So I had to come first and unfortunately he had to put the bikes on the back burner. I'm to blame for his racing career coming to an end!
 We would still enjoy going along to watch racing, though, and probably my two earliest sporting heroes were two Scottish riders, Neil McKenzie and Steve Hislop. I used to go and them watch every year at Knockhill when the Scottish round of the British Superbikes was on.
 When my dad and I would watch MotoGP on the telly it was when Valentino Rossi was the superstar and I became a huge fan of his.
 He was the 125cc world champion at the time and then came through on 250cc and the big class as well. He won nine world championships in all and is clearly one of the greatest of all time. As well as being a winner he's a real entertainer too, which I love. He always puts on great celebrations for the crowds. His suits always stood out too and he was always just a level above everyone else. He was my hero.
 I'd watch Rossi winning world title after world title, but he wasn't just winning them, he was blowing everybody else away. Many of those world titles were won in really dominant fashion. He was a bit like Marc Marquez is now in the MotoGP Championship - a cut above everybody else. Rossi was just class and great to watch.
 And even now he's still up there at the age of 41, at the elite level in motorbike racing. He's still very competitive, which is to be admired. He's racing around with kids that are 19, 20, 21 years old and he's still pushing them. His body is bound to be broken at this stage, loads of broken bones with the amount of crashes he's had over the years. And yet he's still at the top and doing really well. I follow him on Instagram and Twitter and I like to see his updates on his training, and I still cheer for him whenever I'm watching MotoGP.

1971 - 2020 Martha (Marti) Elizabeth Schimmel burst into this world on September 9, 1971 and remained a force of nature for the rest of her life.      Marti loved her family, her friends, her dogs - and her community. She was a stalwart supporter of numerous local charities including Live Forward (formerly AIDS Athens), Athens Area Homeless Shelter, Athens Community Council on Aging, Athens-Clarke Heritage Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Mercy Health Clinic, Athens Jewish Film Festival, Boybutante AIDS Foundation and many others. One of Marti's favorite events, The Boybutante Ball, particularly captured Marti's spirit. It was fun, artistic and most important of all, it was for the benefit of her community.      Marti's work was her passion. She loved to talk about her mother's and her Grammy Schimmel's recipes. She shared cooking secrets and food with anyone who crossed her path. Her namesake restaurant, Marti's at Midday, has been, and will continue to be, a center of the Athens culinary scene, and even more importantly, a place where all people feel welcome. The joy of Marti's spirit remains there.      Marti's friends are always ready to share memorable, hilarious and meaningful stories about Marti - stories about cooking, dancing, dating, traveling, car rides, and many misadventures. No one who ever met Marti could forget her or her red lipstick smile. Her memory will continue to be a source of inspiration and light for all those who knew her.      Marti is preceded in death by her grandparents, Bill and Martha (Grammy) Schimmel and Thomas and Jonelle Minish, and her uncle, David Minish.      She is survived by her parents, Janet and Kevin Kloepfer and Ed and Carol Schimmel; siblings Scott (April) Schimmel, Katie Schimmel, Tom (Kaori) Kloepfer, Jay Kloepfer, Matthew Kloepfer and Stepbrother, David Thomas; goddaughter, Lyra Lyvers; a number of aunts, uncles and cousins; and her Midday family.      Due to current limitations on public gatherings, Marti's funeral was private. A celebration of her life is planned for September. Memorial contributions may be made to: The Giving Kitchen, Boybutante AIDS Foundation, Books for Keeps or the charity of donor's choice.      Bernstein Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.

My biggest concern with Justin Herbert though? His football I.Q. While Herbert is definitely a smart guy (he had a 4.0 GPA), he struggles to read defenses. What that means is he doesn't seem to be able to identify what defensive package the other team is playing. He also struggles to adapt and go off script. While Herbert does show the ability to throw on the run, almost all of his best throws on the run are scripted for him to do so. In other words, they are designed plays to get him on the move such as a play action or a roll out play. However, when a play breaks down and he needs to go off-script, Herbert struggles to make a play; he will either run it himself and try to gain some yards, or, in most cases he will just throw the ball away.

Alex Ferguson believes Arsene Wenger's record for Premier League games managed will never be beaten.
 Arsenal boss Wenger clocked up 811 Premier League fixtures in the dugout during Sunday's controversial 1-1 draw with West Brom, surpassing the benchmark previously set by his old foe Ferguson at Manchester United.
 Wenger is widely seen as the last of a dying breed, having managed the Gunners for more than 20 years, into an era that has seen sackings become much more commonplace.
 And the Old Trafford icon believes Wenger's tally, wherever it ends, will stand the test of time.
 "I applaud Arsene on surpassing my record of managing 810 Premier League games," Ferguson said via the League Managers' Association.
 "It is a fantastic milestone which has required the highest standards of dedication and professional management to achieve. I doubt his record, whatever it turns out to be, will ever be beaten.
 "Congratulations on a truly remarkable career and great service to football and Arsenal FC."

Generally speaking, if people have a great experience with you, that's what they expected and they're probably not going to leave you a review if you haven't asked for one.  On the other hand, if people had a poor experience, they're a lot more likely to leave a review. So if you find that just providing exceptional customer service and asking for reviews are not getting you there, now you can start to incentivize. Now the goal is to get reviews without needing to do this because you do have to watch out for over incentivizing and breaking some of these Terms of Service. You don't want to pay for reviews, especially if those relate to the best dropshipping products. You don't want to incentivize too much to where people are just giving you reviews because they're getting something free in return. There's no value there and people will understand that if they see that on your review platform you probably paid for it. That really hurts your trust. But you can do giveaways! For every verified review that we get we'll pull a name out of the hat and this person gets a service worth X dollars or show us that you have to review on Facebook and get 10% off of your next purchase. Something like that. By incentivizing at a base level you give someone something back for them spending time leaving a review. At the end of the day, providing excellent customer service is your number one priority. But if you need to incentivize, it's okay. As long as you're strategic about it and you're providing a great value.

As I have mentioned before, hopefully, we will have many yard sales in the wide open spaces where people can search for treasures of all kinds — treasures depending on your wants and desires of your antiquing skills. Or better yet, just some little things you will enjoy adding to your other treasures. Thus, your treasure hunting will continue and we will have a few moments of interruption of our daily lives and the pandemic will be camouflaged for a few hours.
 It may be just a phone call, or a card in the mail, or the Easter Bunny knocking at your door — but, whatever it may be, we are all blessed to be here on Earth and be able to talk with our families (by phone or email) and visit with our neighbors over the backyard fence at a distance. Or maybe even just take a drive for a short trip to see the green alfalfa fields and the pastures with their green grasses or maybe even up through the gorgeous Sandhills this time of year. Whatever your outing may be, I know we all will face, whatever the future may bring us, a bit better with good thoughts in our hearts and peace of mind that, “this, too, will pass.”
 Keep in mind there are better days ahead for all of us, I pray, and if we all work together we will be able to continue our journeys as they were meant to be traveled. Please take time to smell the roses and take a nap, or call someone and visit with them via our phone system or email systems we have today. Just a quick call or a quick note means so very much to all of us.
 Take care, everyone — and please remember that my “Trash & Treasures” articles for the past 28 years or so have been written with you in mind and with prayers always. Happy Easter, everybody, and may the Easter Bunny be good to you again this year.

Racing Club have criticised Atletico Madrid for allegedly giving sought-after striker Lautaro Martinez a medical examination without their permission.
 Martinez, 20, is regarded as one of South America's most talented players under the age of 21, establishing himself in Racing's first team and Argentina's youth setup.
 The striker has been heavily linked with a move to Atletico, a club Racing have strong ties with due to Diego Simeone's time as a player and coach with the Avellaneda-based side.
 Atletico have already had one bid of €12.75million rejected by Racing, but that did not stop the Spanish side from examining the youngster, according to club president Victor Blanco.
 "Lautaro came from an operation on his foot and what they [Atletico] did was an X-ray or examination of how he had been in the operation," Blanco said.
 "It was nothing more than that, but it was not good to do it either.
 "It was bad for the people of Atletico to do it, because he should have at least asked us for permission, which we would have given him."
 Blanco is confident that he will be able to keep hold of Martinez for the time being, however, believing that the youngster – who rejected a move to Real Madrid as a teenager – is eager to play in the 2018 Copa Libertadores with Racing.
 "I have talked with the player and we are all thinking about the future," said Blanco. "I am 90 per cent sure that Lautaro will ask to play [in the Copa Libertadores], because he could go now, but he has the dream of winning the Copa Libertadores with Racing.
 "If they [Atletico] don't reach the price and the conditions that Racing wants, which is for him to stay and play the Copa Libertadores, then he will not be sold."

Arsenal is facing increasing competition in their bid to sign Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey.


  The Gunners have been tracking the Ghanaian and Mikel Arteta has reportedly made him one of his top transfer targets.


  The 26-year-old is also being considered for a new deal at his present club and that has made competition for his signature even tougher.


  A report from Standard Sports is claiming that the midfielder is now attracting the attention of Inter Milan and AS Roma.


  Antonio Conte is looking to bring in Partey to strengthen his midfield as he looks to return Inter to its golden era.


  The Italians are no longer a struggling side and are battling with Juventus for the Serie A this season and have also had back to back seasons in the Champions League which would make them an attractive option.


  Arsenal is struggling to qualify for European competition this season and Mikel Arteta knows that players do take that into serious consideration when deciding on a move.


  That said, the Gunners still have a few games left to save their season and qualify for at least the Europa League.


  Atletico Madrid cannot be ruled out either, there is still a chance Partey will remain with them after what has happened with the pandemic outbreak, no one knows what effect it will have on players when they plan their futures.

The docuseries didn't exactly portray Carole in the best light, either. Because she has become famous for rescuing big cats, the series gave Joe Exotic a lot of time on air to voice all the complaints he has against her; It also led to several people accusing her of murdering her husband, putting her body into a meat grinder and feeding her tigers.

Still, it’s not the ministry these men — or those they teach each Sunday — have grown accustomed to.
 “Ministry is all about people,” Chivers said. “Connecting people with Jesus. That’s obviously limited with the social distancing. Loving our neighbors (while) not spreading the virus means a lot more phone calls, a lot more video chats, which I’ve tried to do as much as possible so we can see each other’s faces. Before the order, I was delivering things to people’s homes, still keeping the safe distance.
 “It’s been different and we’re definitely looking forward to whenever we can be together safely again.”
 For McIntyre, some of the challenges have been unique.
 Much like those attending his church, he finds himself making a challenging transition.
 “One of the things that is along those lines that has been a challenge for me, personally, is I’m used to getting up in front of people and interacting with people, a crowd, and we worship face to face where I’m getting feedback and interacting with a crowd. When I do that on camera my brain is having to do something different there that I’m not used to.
 “It’s just a different — another thing, when I get in front of people I can think on my feet and I can go up with some bullet points and I can have this in my head and say what I need to say and I’ve learned to do that over the year. It’s a real struggle when you translate that to a camera … it’s very different.”
 Turner, pastor of the First Church of the Nazarene in Statesville, still hosts a small group for services, making sure he remains within the guidelines.
 Defining himself as a “people person”, he admits to feeling the change. However, he bristles at any suggestion that people cannot worship fully.
 “If you know who you are in Christ, the government’s not going to take away my First Amendment right away from me if I want to get down and worship,” he said. “It doesn’t take but two or three to worship. I can worship by myself.”
 He adds, “I celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ every day, not once a year.”
 So while people may be worshipping differently right now, they are still finding comfort in the church — while the leaders there work to maintain and fill what they see as their role in this outbreak.
 While all look forward to the day when people can move about freely without fear of illness once more, they’re adjusting and finding a way to reach the flock — and beyond.
 “We’re supposed to be known for love of God and love of neighbor and so that’s my prayer is that people will be able to see the love of Christ through all the churches,” Chivers said.

The majority of tests rely on a technique known as PCR to process samples, which involves extracting ribonucleic acid, or RNA, from the virus samples taken from a patient. RNA, however, is especially unstable: Enzymes that break it down exist all over the place, including on our bodies. Amid a scarcity of supplies, hospitals have reported splitting the liquid that preserves samples in testing kits, or using supplies from flu and strep kits. Shortages of the right swabs have led some clinics to use alternatives; some are even attempting to validate Q-tips. Shortages of chemicals to process samples have also led to experimentation with substitutes. All of these situations could potentially lead to an inaccurate result.

"And then, and still now and for a good deal of the foreseeable future it seems, coronavirus sweeps much of the world, leaving it, in many places, in lockdown, a pattern of life imposed upon us, for our good and the good of others, the like of which few have ever before experienced.
 "A cloud of sickness and distress hangs over many nations, communities and families; precious lives have been lost, healthcare and other services are reaching breaking point, and an entire way of life, thought to be unassailable is in tatters.
 "But there, in the very heart of it, amidst all the mess and worry and suffering and inconvenience and darkness, are love and light, love and light which nothing can extinguish."
 In his Easter message, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: "Usually, the Easter bank holiday is a time when families and friends would come together, but this year will be very different for most of us, as we stay at home to protect ourselves and our loved ones."
 He added there were "some early signs" the restrictions were helping to slow the spread of the virus, but also warned there was "still a long way to go".
 "I know that staying at home for extended periods is difficult, and families all over Wales are making many sacrifices every single day. But these rules are there to protect us and our loved ones.
 "Not going to religious and social gatherings will help to keep our families and our communities safe."

You don't have reviews because you didn't ask for any and 68% of people will leave a review when they're asked. Now you could start by asking some customers you've done work for in the past. You can ask them face to face. You can send out an email. You can just reach out to them in different ways. But eventually, you're going to want to offer an opportunity for people to leave reviews that you haven't communicated with directly. This is a great way that you can start to generate more reviews, more volume and more trust and people look for that as well. If you've got two or three five-star reviews, honestly, that's not adding a whole lot of value. People are going to look for that volume. They're going to look for consistency. People want to see how many other people agree with them. This is confirmation bias, right? People want to believe that they make good decisions. So by seeing other reviews, they're automatically going to think that they're making a good decision as well. But you can't get those reviews if you don't ask for them. You can use a myriad of different ways like email, text, on Facebook, and ask people face-to-face. I love it when service clients or people that go to other Properties or locations take an iPad with you pull up your review platform. Whatever that is, whether it's a Google+, Facebook, Top Rated Local you can just have that pulled up. Thank you so much for the time. We know that you love the service that we provided. Would you mind leaving us a review? It's a great way to get more reviews to get high-quality reviews and not have to worry about people not having the time later on. You need the reviews. So you have to ask for them.

FALL RIVER -- Before the coronavirus pandemic, a normal bad day for EMS Capt. Robert Camara, the Fall River Fire Department's infection control officer, involved getting a report that one of his paramedics was stuck with a needle during a call.
 Maybe the EMS worker on scene had an accident while starting an IV on a patient. Camara said he'd walk the first responder through paperwork and conferring with doctors, seeing the case to the end. That was a bad day.
 Then, the coronavirus crisis hit.
 "This is over the top. This is uncharted territory," said Camara. "Fall River EMS was more prepared than other departments with the amount of PPE (personal protective equipment) we had in stock and our training, but obviously something smaller than this.
 "Three or four weeks ago we were watching it and kept saying, 'This is going to get out of hand and we need to do something about it,' and we did. We fired the first shot on this thing with the first fire department/paramedics outside testing site in this state, right here in the city of Fall River."
 A partnership with Prima CARE, Steward Health Care and the Fall River EMS division, the drive-up COVID-19 testing site opened three weeks ago under the direction of the health care providers' doctors.
 "We were 110% on board because this is very, very important," said Camara.
 The outdoor testing site is not open to the general public. A doctor from Prima CARE or Steward Health Care must order the testing and patients are given appointments.
 Camara set up the outdoor testing facility and helps orchestrate the process. EMS Capt. Jennifer Rodriques swabs the patients with the assistance of Camara and other city paramedics.
 At the testing site, where the special operations trailer and a tent are set up, the paramedics don secure personal protective equipment: full-length yellow suits, N95 masks, face shields, goggles and gloves.
 After every swab, the paramedic puts on a fresh pair of gloves. Safety checks are constant.
 At the end of their shifts at the testing site, Camara said the front-line workers wash with a decontamination solution.
 "The goal is to test as many people as we can, and we're not just testing Fall River people. We're testing people from Somerset and Swansea, Little Compton, Tiverton and Pawtucket. Everywhere, just all over the place," said Camara.
 The results go directly to the prescribing doctor, who notifies various departments of health. Eventually, a community health agent tracks down and requests a quarantine of anyone who may have been exposed to a patient who tests positive for the virus.
 "That's the only way to stop the virus," Camara said. "That's so, so important."
 To accommodate the constant changes associated with fighting the fast-moving coronavirus, the EMS department has had to be nimble and adaptive. Camara credits Fire Chief John Lynch, EMS Director Tim Oliveira and fellow paramedics.
 "This is super-dangerous work, but our role hasn't changed. We have to save lives," said Camara. "But now, we have to do it in the safest manner that we can and it's difficult, but we are doing advanced things in this department.
 "Everyone is doing what they are supposed to do on a level that never existed before."

Giving the latest forecast, a Met Office spokesman said: "It's going to be a bright start to Easter Sunday across a good part of England and Wales, and like with recent days those temperatures will rise rapidly in the strong April sunshine, but it will help trigger some sharp potentially thundery showers for the afternoon."
 "For Scotland and Northern Ireland, it's cloudier with some outbreaks of rain here. Warm again in the south east with temperatures approaching the mid- twenties, but much colder across northern Scotland later in the day.
 "And that cold air floods south across all parts of the country into Easter Monday, you will notice that if you are out and about."
 "Some sunshine too, but look at these temperatures 8-10 colder quite widely compared to what we saw at the weekend.
