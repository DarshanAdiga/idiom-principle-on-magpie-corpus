 HOLLAND -- Cases of COVID-19 in local schools are on the rise.
 Six local districts reported as many or more cases in the past week than they had so far this school year.
 Local districts have reported a combined 54 cases so far this year. Since Monday, Oct. 12, nearly 500 Holland-area students (excluding Saugatuck, which has not reported quarantine numbers) have been put into quarantine, according to data from local districts.
 Meanwhile, the state reported Friday more than 2,000 new cases for the second consecutive day.
 Holland Public Schools -- which had just four cases between the start of the school year and Oct. 9 -- reported six new cases in the district Friday, Oct. 16. There are seven active cases in the district, five at Holland High School, one at Holland Middle School and one at Holland Language Academy.
 There are 207 students currently in quarantine at HPS, which is 6 percent of the student body. Additionally, 17 staff members are in either isolation or quarantine.
 In the weekly update, HPS advised that Holland High School will be included in Monday's School-Related Outbreak Reporting from the state, but the district plans to keep all buildings open.
 Holland High, Early College and HVRT all went remote for Monday, Oct. 12, but returned to school Tuesday, Oct. 13.
 The state defines an outbreak as two or more linked cases, not from the same household, who were not identified as close contacts of each other in another setting.
 The district also wrote that no one in the district has reported experiencing serious health problems due to COVID-19 to this point.
 Saugatuck Public Schools, which shifted its middle/high school building to remote learning for the week of Oct. 12-16, saw an increase as well.
 The district reported two cases Oct. 9 and one each day Oct. 10-13 and 16. The new case on Friday makes seven active cases of COVID-19 in the district, all students in the high school.
