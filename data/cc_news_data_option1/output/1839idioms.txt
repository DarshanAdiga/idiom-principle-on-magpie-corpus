Harleys draw flack for their amplified engine noise and disturbance of the peace, yet surprisingly riding through the park on the back of one of these muscle machines can prove meditative. As you're unable to talk for most of the tour's one-hour duration, the only thing left to do is sit back, take in views of the rock and frame up your photos.

The off-season is big for all Ontario Hockey League players.
 But an argument can be made it's especially significant for elite youngsters - those with very-high ceilings -- readying for their second go-around in the 20-team loop.
 Defenceman Jacob Holmes, the Soo Greyhounds first-round choice (No. 18 overall) in the 2019 Priority Selections draft, is determined to grow as a player.
 But the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced the closure of many things - including hockey rinks - is making it difficult for all involved.
 "It's a big summer for me. It's frustrating not being able to work out or skate," said Holmes, a 16-year-old (2003 birth year) native of Alliston, Ont. "I'm missing hockey."
 That said, the six-foot-two, 190-pounder also spoke of how he's certainly on board with decisions made by government, and the OHL, which cancelled the remainder of its regular season and playoffs on March 18.
 Holmes spoke of how "I totally understand the decision made by the OHL to suspend play. Obviously, we're in unprecedented times and the health and safety of players, coaches and fans is of the utmost importance."
 At the same time, Holmes has a burning desire to make the most of the time between seasons.
 As a rookie, he gained confidence as the OHL campaign progressed.
 He played much more in the second half of the season and wound up finishing with three goals, six assists and a plus-minus of plus-9 in 57 games.
 In a late season interview with The Sault Star, Hounds head coach John Dean praised Holmes for the improvements he'd made as the season unfolded.
 Dean especially likes the offensive skills - skating, puck-handling and shooting - Holmes brings to the table.
 "I want to get faster and stronger this off-season," Holmes said. "Development comes from spring and summer. I feel like that time plays a big part in a player's development and confidence."
 What he'd like to improve, Holmes added, is his defensive-zone skating and his work at the offensive blue-line.
 "I had a big summer last year and I feel like getting on the ice would benefit me this summer," he said.
 Asked to analyze his rookie campaign, Holmes talked about how entering the OHL was an adjustment.
 However, after he was selected to skate at the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge held in Medicine Hat and Swift Current, Sask., in early November, things changed.
 "I started to play with more confidence," Holmes said. "My decision-making with the puck was more polished. I played with a lot more of an edge and showed I had confidence in myself."
 An impressive student - especially when it comes to mathematics -- Holmes was named the Western Conference's academic player of the month for December.
 He talked about trying to stay busy with his school work while waiting for social-distancing restrictions to be lifted.
 "I'm also trying to work out at home," said Holmes, who spoke of doing weight- training and cardio work in order to try to stay sharp. "But I miss playing."

Even Frum's summary about the "Russian Hoax" is misleading - we've long known how much of the important stuff was done, and the fight has been less over "did he do anything wrong?" or even much "how did they dod it" and much more over "give me the goddamn documents, you anti-Constitutional fucks" to prove it. Sadly their attack on the Constitution, stonewalling, obstructing justice, destroying evidence, and simply breaking every political & legal norm they can is being interpreted as somehow a draw, as if they'd played us to a tie in chess rather than overturned the board and locked one of the judges in a closet. (yeah, take that for an allusion to Anthony Kennedy, or any number of cases of judicial foul play). Think back to how many investigations we thought were being spun off in 2017-2018, and how many (SDNY? Maria Butina & NRA? Erik Prince's perjury? what UAE was going meeting with Trump in Dec 2016?) were pre-empted & buried.

One such writing propelled us down the road 50 years, to an imaginary conversation between a grandfather and grandson. The grandson said, "Grandpa, that must have been a terribly hard time when you lived through the pandemic." The grandfather's reply was. "I don't remember it as a terrible time. For me it was a special time in my family as we played games, watched movies together, and ate our meals together. We didn't seem to need to be in a hurry and my parents had time to do things with us. It was not a terrible time, but a special time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

In 2001, I went to Gloucester and had an incredible year under Philippe Saint-Andre. When I had the call from the agent telling me there was a chance to go there, I said yes straight away. I wanted to test myself against the best week in, week out. Back then, Argentina didn’t have regular fixtures against the top nations so you may only get to play against world-class players every six months. In France, I’d be facing Christophe Dominici one week, and then someone like Thomas Castaignede the next. It was the same in England; Gloucester is such an incredible place to play rugby with the Shed, the passionate crowd, and the team we had was very good.                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

It appears supporters in the UK face a long wait to attend matches, with the guidelines recognising a return to sport in front of a crowd "may only be fully possible significantly later depending on the reduction in numbers of infections".                                                                                                                                                          Sports events involving international travel, such as football's European competitions, cricket tours and Formula One, could be affected by the government's planned introduction of an enforced 14-day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK, except for those from countries "on a short list of exemptions".                                                                                                                                                          Premier League clubs are meeting on Monday to continue their discussions on "Project Restart".

I have no inclination to defend Trump whom I despise or Barr or anybody else that comes to mind in the current administration. I also see no reason to give any benefit of doubt to the spawn of J. Edgar Hoover. The story of Flynn is distorted greatly in different directions depending on which side is telling but is only one part of a bigger story, one which is not as simple and cut and dried as so many would have it.

With production in Hollywood still on lock-down, it remains unclear as to when and how new scripted shows can be made. So Fox is going with a lineup that largely consists of sports franchises (football and wrestling), reality series, animated comedies and shows that were already in the can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Dear Dominic, Your last words were hurtful to say the least, the reason why i decided to write you this open letter. Hopefully you’ll change your mind about me and many of us sharing the same situation after watching this video. Don’t get me wrong, i don’t blame you for what you are or this current situation because after all, it’s mainly up to national and international federations to look after tennis family and sort out difficulties, for the sake of this sport. But this answer is a way to bring light to our situation and maybe also protecting our integrity... Our voice deserve to be heard also...

Aguirre said Sunday afternoon that despite some folks coming within six feet of each other — the minimum distance health experts say to stay apart to avoid spreading the virus — by and large, the weekend was progressing well.          "Overall it was kind of what we expected," Aguirre said. "We expected to have lots of folks out there but they seemed to be behaving themselves, in most cases."          Whether the parks stay open depends on how people behave, Ernie Apreza, communications director for Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan.          "One thing we made really clear is we will move to close parks as necessary," Apreza said. Residents should continue to observe the governor's stay home order and use the parks just to take a break, he added.          The city parks department continues to close parking areas at the largest parks and recommends that people walk to their neighborhood park to disperse use rather than converging on popular ones.          Mike Faulk, spokesman for Gov. Jay Inslee, said the governor also is keeping an eye on the situation -- and on health statistics -- especially given how crowded parks were before he moved to close them.          "As with lifting prohibitions on other activities, it may require a little more time to see how the changes in restrictions affect the data," Faulk said.

Record-breaking warm weather tempted people out of isolation and into Seattle parks over the weekend, and although the city tried to keep them apart, some ignored physical distancing guidance meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.          Games were struck up on ball fields. Cars were all over the place at Discovery Park. The trails at Green Lake Park were thronged with skateboarders, roller bladers and bicyclists zooming past a sign banning skateboarding, rollerblading and bicycling.          The city deployed about 70 "park ambassadors" around Seattle to remind people not to form groups or picnic. Police helped clear parks and popular beaches, including Golden Gardens, at 8 p.m. Saturday without incident, said Jesus Aguirre, superintendent for the Seattle's Parks and Recreation department.          "We want to be sure we can keep everybody safe," Aguirre said. " We are monitoring it closely, and if we have to close parks again, we will."          Enforcement at Green Lake on Sunday was sparse, although a sign warned sunbathers, "Crowded Parks lead to Closed Parks." Others advised, simply: "Keep it moving."          The ambassadors are at only some of the biggest parks, so it is up to each person to follow the rules, Aguirre said. "Ambassadors can't do this work. We all have to do this work."

Eventually, the migrants disembarked and were taken to one of Libya's detention facilities notorious for torture and abuse, the U.N. migration agency said Friday.                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Roma, 11 mag. (Labitalia) - Cosa accade nel momento in cui un virus porta i governi di tutto il mondo a mettere in quarantena miliardi di persone, generando di fatto il blocco totale della domanda e dell’offerta a livello mondiale? Nasce da questa domanda la seconda analisi di Future of Italy, il gruppo operativo per la narrazione di un mondo nuovo e la rinascita dell’Italia ideato e composto da Matteo Flora, fondatore di The Fool, Andrea Fontana, co-fondatore e Presidente di Storyfactory, e Oscar Di Montigny, fondatore e Presidente di Be Your Essence. Covid-19, in questa prima parte del 2020, sancisce la crisi del lavoro e della ricchezza, ma ancora di piu puo rappresentare la perdita di se nella piu grande catastrofe economica e sociale mai vissuta dall’umanita. Un dramma che ha portato il gruppo di Future Of Italy ad indagare cosa gli italiani stiano dicendo in merito al tema lavoro nelle loro conversazioni social, quale sara il racconto del lavoro da fare nella crisi e quale progettualita organizzativa portare avanti in questo momento di transizione. Permangono i gruppi individuati nel precedente report: paurosi, confusi, critici e speranzosi.

With rare bluntness, the editor of Germany's largest newspaper, Bild Zeitung, called out the Chinese government not only for its cover-up of the coronavirus crisis that is endangering public health and crashing economies around the world, but for a host of other misdeeds. In an April 17 editorial, in the form of an open letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, Bild-Zeitung editor Julian Reichelt makes it clear that the Chinese government and the ruling Communist Party should be treated as a hostile player on the world stage. "You are endangering the world," is how Reichelt titled his letter/editorial.
 Included in Reichelt's bill of indictments is the charge that "China enriches itself with the invention of others, instead of inventing on its own." One of the ways that China has succeeded in pillaging Western technology has been by sending students to study in the United States and other countries that innovate. The United States, perhaps more than any other nation, has opened the doors to its top universities and research centers to Chinese students who are directly beholden to the Chinese government. Of the approximately 1.1 million student visa holders in 2018-19 school year, some 370,000 were Chinese nationals.
 Many of these students have direct ties to the Chinese military or the ruling regime. They are here primarily to acquire the innovative technologies in open academic settings when possible, and through espionage when necessary. The Chinese regime is intent on acquiring Western know-how "through malign behaviors that exploit features of a free-market economy and an open society like ours," warned Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Demers in congressional testimony in 2018.
 The revelation of Chinese government-backed espionage being carried out on the campuses of our top research institutes was followed a few weeks later by indictments of Chinese military officials for a 2017 breach of the credit reporting company Equifax, in which the personal information of some 150 million Americans was compromised. Chinese government officials are also believed to have been involved in massive hacks of U.S. government personnel data, health insurance company records and even the Marriott hotel chain.
 Even those without clear links to Chinese Communist Party or military, Chinese students are beholden to the regime because it is footing the cost of their tuition - a fact that also makes these full-tuition students attractive to many U.S. universities. The current global crisis, for which Beijing bears much responsibility, on top of the myriad other transgressions of the Chinese government, should trigger some reassessment of whether it is a wise idea to be allocating one-third of foreign student visas to citizens of that country, as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) suggested during a Fox News appearance this weekend.
 To be very clear, the problem is not that these students are Chinese. The problem is that directly or indirectly, they are being used by a corrupt regime that is inimical to our interests.
 Nor is this the first time that the United States has naively allowed its academic freedom to be exploited by a hostile power, or allowed universities' desires for full-tuition students to undermine our interests. As recounted by British researcher Svetlana Lokhova, the same strategy was employed by Joseph Stalin to help the Soviet Union acquire American secrets and technology in the 1930s and establish a spy network that inflicted harm on the United States for decades.
 Student visas should promote the interests of the United States, not undermine them. Free academic exchange and cooperative development of technologies should be a two-way street, and priority should be placed on building academic ties with nations that share our interests and values. Or perhaps more importantly, a portion of the 370,000 university and postgraduate slots being filled by Chinese nationals -- particularly those in the STEM fields -- could be reallocated to qualified and deserving American students who would put these skills to use for the benefit of our country, not its detriment.
 Among the many, many reassessments to be made after the current crisis abates is whether the price of full-tuition for 370,000 students who are answerable to a repressive and dishonest regime that is "endangering the world," is worth the damage that it causes.

One reason why the global economy will never be the same after the coronavirus pandemic is long forgotten, is that supply-chains - which have been in place for decades, taking advantage of China's cheap labor costs and keeping global inflation in check - are being gutted and overhauled, in many cases from scratch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Via Roma negli anni 30, è tutta un cantiere. Mia madre, io bambino, mi portava in Piazza San Carlo a visitare il “padiglione provvisorio”, (un po’ Barocco e un po’ Liberty) con i negozi lì trasferiti. Ricordo le tazze di “bachelite”, la lana Rossi fatta con il latte. Quei prodotti dell’autarchia, allora brillanti e ben politicamente reclamizzati, dovevano in pochi anni diventare simbolo di miseria. La vecchia Via di Porta Nuova, giudicata troppo stretta, viene abbattuta. La regia della costruzione di via Roma è di Piacentini, chiamato a Torino “in quanto Accademico d’Italia” per “dare un tocco di ideologia ad un’operazione fondiaria di grande mole”, e a mediare tra gli architetti torinesi che si azzuffavano, divisi tra classicisti – il mito di Roma imperiale – e Modernisti. Ciò che li univa era solo la comune fede fascista. Il primo tratto sarà neoclassico, il secondo sarà neobarocco.

She finds it rewarding and said her clients “are like family to me.”          Yet now with the coronavirus pandemic, the job has become scary. Every day her work requires her to be out in the community, shuttling between her clients’ homes, pharmacies and grocery stores, to make sure their needs are met. She's in physical contact, in close quarters, with multiple people a day.          She did all that, she said, for a month and half with just four disposable surgical masks she carefully saved and reused out of necessity. Ideally, she said, she would have had a new mask for every client every day but in the first months of the pandemic, masks were in short supply. Recently a friend gave her two homemade cloth masks, which provided some security, and she said more supplies are now being provided. Anwar herself has health conditions that put her at higher risk if she contracts the virus, but when she had her own COVID-19 scare, she worried most about who would take care of her clients and be there for her adult children if she was sick.          “The work we are doing right now,” Anwar said, “it's work only people can do if they have a heart, because this is a hard time. This is a hard job.”          Since the pandemic began, attention, praise and cheers of appreciation have rightly focused on the health care workers who courageously show up to hospitals and medical centers each day — at great risk to themselves and their families.

I've been saying this all along:  the idiots trying to fight the "tyranny" of lockdowns and forced preventative measures like masks/social distancing… are just even more tyrannically forcing people to place their lives in jeopardy for "freedom" and money.  It's disgusting.

Preliminary research by a Boston-based biotech firm suggests that treatment may not be consistent across the board. The study found that black people who visited hospitals with Covid-19 symptoms in February and March _were less likely to get tested or treated than white patients_.

"Los pronósticos revelan que el nivel de inversión directa del Estado va a sufrir una contracción, por el déficit que ha dejado la contingencia social y luego por el covid-19. Por eso, las concesiones deben actuar como palanca para que el Estado pueda seguir en la senda del crecimiento a través de más y mejores infraestructuras, reactive la economía y el país pueda seguir gozando del liderazgo en la región en esta materia", comenta Rivas.

Once the tournament gets over, the 40,000-capacity stadium will be completely dismantled, with its parts transformed into sporting facilities in Qatar and overseas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     While the stadium's sustainable legacy is guaranteed, what most people do not know is what measures were taken to ensure its location - close to Doha Port and overlooking the spectacular West Bay skyline - became suitable to house the construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The land where Ras Abou Aboud is being built had to be decontaminated after years of industrial use, meaning a legacy for the site has been delivered before the project has even been completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Significant work has been carried out by the SC to remove the existing buildings, laboratories, workshops and fuel tanks. Some of the old buildings were kept - partly for their architectural value, but also to ensure new facilities did not need to be created from scratch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Of the proposed eight World Cup venues, work on one stadium -- the Khalifa International Stadium -- is already complete while the SC has promised to deliver the remaining venues two years before the kick off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In a break from tradition, Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup was controversially pushed back to a winter window because of the scorching summer temperatures in the tiny Middle East country during the normal FIFA World Cup window of June-July.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     As such, the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup, will be held from November 21 to December 18.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        _(With inputs from SC Media)_

In addition, areas ravaged by natural disasters could use the system to generate electricity to aid in reconstruction efforts long before traditional electrical infrastructure is rebuilt. It could even power autonomous ships at sea, the report said.

Documents containing digital signatures are in no way different from documents containing a pen on paper signature as they would even stand in court when produced as a digital signature cannot be copied and also contains a date and time stamp. Actually, the only restraint of using digital signature is the weak laws regarding cyber security which might cause any unnecessary hassles in case of a court case and that both parties have to purchase the certificates for the digital signature in order to use it instead of the one party courier charge.
