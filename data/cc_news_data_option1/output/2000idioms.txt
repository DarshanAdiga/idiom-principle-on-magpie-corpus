Sometimes life can get super tough and you can feel like the world is against you….. I've been there many many times…. and it's in those vulnerable moments that I try to push aside all my negative feelings and just get lost in a moment. Because when you're dancing in the rain you don't have time to think about body insecurities or family issues or whatever else is weighing down your beautiful soul. It's just you, experiencing the beauty of this world, judgement free. So shake those tiger stripes with me and get lost in a moment. Song: Blame it on Your Love by @Charli_xcx and @lizzobeeating

 Six months after Seeso soft-launched, the subscription video-on-demand comedy channel has a slate of 23 originals up and running or in the works, said Evan Shapiro, NBCU executive VP of digital enterprises, at a Banff Festival panel.
 The exec offered insights into how the channel came to be, with NBCU CEO Steve Burke telling Shapiro about his desire for what Shapiro called a “direct-to- consumer” product, similar to Netflix or Hulu.
 Next was market research, with some 11,000 people polled about what they’d pay for in terms of a dedicated OTT channel. “Comedy was No. 1 by a long shot,” said Shapiro.
 New content includes Morgan Spurlock’s documentary on women’s rec basketball, _The Pistol Shrimps_ , and Dan Harmon’s _HarmonQuest_ , an animated rendition of Harmon and his comedy friends playing Dungeons and Dragons.
 Seeso does not share subscriber figures, but Shapiro did shed light on its economics. “We don’t need 5-6 million people watching for a show to be a hit,” he said. “We know when shows are driving subscriptions.”
