As a rule, an increase in the general price fluctuations leads to an increase in value, a decrease to a decrease in value of the warrant. The remaining term also plays an important role. The longer the period until the expiry date, the higher the chance that the underlying will move in a positive direction for the warrant. With the decrease in the remaining term, the so-called fair value decreases accordingly, which is zero when the warrant expires.

Office space emerged as the most preferred segment by High Net worth Individuals (HNIs) in India, accounting for 67% of their total investments in real estate, according to a report by JLL. The Private Wealth Group report said that country’s office sector has witnessed a robust growth over the last four years with the average annual net absorption crossing 30 mn sq ft. This resulted in steady rentals and capital appreciation, until the onset of the pandemic. “Real estate, which plays the dual role of a contributor as well as a beneficiary of growth, will prove to be the most important asset class in the HNI portfolio due to its tangible nature, stable income, steady returns and collateral value,” said Ramesh Nair, CEO & Country Head (India), JLL. “Furthermore, the nature of investments within real estate has seen transition with higher allocation towards commercial office space assets and in publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), helping investors reimagine deployment strategies,” he added. The number of HNIs and family offices in India has been growing at a steady pace and they continue to allocate more capital into commercial real estate investments with a focus on office. Office space investments offer stable annual cash flow and capital appreciation thereby offering attractive returns for HNIs. JLL expects additional demand for quality warehousing space which has driven recent activities in the e-commerce, FMCG and pharma sectors. Delhi NCR, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru, remained the top three cities in terms of warehousing space absorption in 2019 accounting for more than 20 mn sq. ft. of absorption. “India has more than 600 mn sq ft of Grade-A office space across its top seven cities in Q1 2020, and saw record absorption, steady rentals and low vacancy levels till this period. While we’re observing a temporary pause due to the global pandemic, this space is expected to bounce back. We’re expecting to see attractive investment opportunities in the strata office space, which is estimated to be 180 mn sq ft valued at Rs 2.26 lakh crore (USD 30 bn),” said Vishal Ahuja, Head, Private Wealth Group, JLL India.

Of course, there is still worry about the future, the economy, health and the precarious political climate. But reading for pleasure is known to alleviate anxiety as well as reduce symptoms of depression and grief. Books can help you fall asleep, lower stress through laughter or tears, and provide alternative insights into how others have coped with similar difficult life challenges.
 Psychologists, including myself, have long turned to bibliotherapy alongside more traditional therapy modalities to support a patient's mental health. While therapists can recommend books that encompass any genre from memoirs to self-help, we often turn to fiction. When we relate to characters from a novel we sometimes discover that their narrative helps us make sense of our own difficult pasts, guide us in identifying and labeling our own complicated feelings, make us feel less isolated, and even begin to experience vicarious hope and contentment.
