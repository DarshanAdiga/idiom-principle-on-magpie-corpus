DR. FAUCI:   Well, I think it has to be gradual. That's the first thing. I don't think it's a switch that goes on and off, on, off and you just got to determine the situation that you're in. But one of the critical issues that you have to see is a clear cut indication that we're turning the corner and the cases are coming down. We saw that in China after much suffering. We're starting to see that a bit in Italy now and even in New York there are some very interesting and I think cautiously optimistic signs that the number of cases are starting to plateau and come down. Once they get over that hump and come down, they usually come down in a pretty steep way. When you start seeing that, then you can start thinking about the possibility of getting back to those first steps towards normal.

DR. FAUCI:   It's very difficult as hell. It depends on the degree to which certain regions, state, cities adhere to the mitigation. I think that, for the most part, the United States is doing very well. Obviously the things that you're concerned about is those areas where you have big cities. Every state has a metropolis in it, some much larger than others. So any situation where you have a concentration of people, the epitome of that is what we're seeing in New York, in New Orleans, in Detroit. Hopefully we would not see that kind of explosive infection that we did see unfortunately in New York and to some extent in New Orleans, Detroit and other places, but you have to be careful with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. California and Washington state have actually done quite well in their mitigation to prevent that explosion of cases. But you have to be prepared that any particular location, city, town, or what have you is potentially a hotspot. And that's the reason why you can't relax your mitigation regardless of where you are. If you look at the map of the United States, there are cases all over the place, each of which is a little bit of an ember that can turn into a fire, and that's what you have to worry about.

In the one-and-done era, when players can leave after just one season of college, Gonzaga‚Äôs ability to restock its talent stands out to Daniels.

 But that maintenance is a symptom, in some sense more than the cause. The cause is tied to the way Gonzaga has created ideal conditions for players to reach their fullest potential and also to a knack for identifying talented players who are also team-oriented.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little easier said than done to get the level of players they‚Äôre getting,‚Äù said Bankhead, a Walla Walla native who played for Gonzaga from 2000 to 2004.

South Bruce Peninsula Mayor Janice Jackson says a private security firm will "actively" enforce new provincial restrictions which permit cottage and similar rentals only on an emergency basis to limit COVID-19 pandemic spread.
 Last week's tightened provincial emergency order, which whittled down the list of essential businesses allowed to stay open, also restricted short-term rental accommodation providers such as those on the Bruce Peninsula.
 Twenty-nine people in Grey-Bruce have tested positive for this respiratory illness which has brought daily routines to a halt for almost three weeks now. No one locally has died from COVID-19 but the toll by Tuesday afternoon in Ontario was 153 deaths.
 Ontario's tough new limits on short-term accommodations were welcomed - by both local accommodation providers themselves and the mayor -- with both saying in interviews Tuesday they want to limit visitors at this time for public safety.
 "We're dealing with hundreds of transient rentals on a daily basis and thousands on a weekend," Jackson said in an interview. "And we simply can't afford to have travel between communities during this crisis."
 The municipality is using a private company, James Special Services, which enforces town bylaws at Sauble Beach. Its employees issued a couple of $750 tickets last weekend to people who weren't supposed to be on the closed beach.
 With the typically busy Easter weekend coming, the mayor said they want to be ready.
 Letters were sent out Tuesday afternoon to cottage rental companies to remind them of the provincial order, just before the town issued a news release announcing fines under the Emergency Management Protection Act for breaching the provincial order range from $100,000 for individuals to $500,000 for a corporate officer and $10 million for a corporation, with up to a year in jail possible.
 "We're going to be actively enforcing this as of Friday at noon," Jackson said. "There are people that are in rental units right now. We're not necessarily wanting to go in and kick them right out. We'll give them a couple of days to pack their things and leave."
 The two-week provincial order, which may be extended, says short-term accommodation providers must ensure any rentals booked after April 4 are "only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period."
 Jackson said renters who resist the order could face a $1,000 fine for obstruction.
 "Our goal will be to find out who the owner is of the property. And if there's a rental company, we want that to be identified as well. And those are really the folks we are going after."
 The town's news release said cottage owners are still welcome but if they come they should stay until the health crisis passes and not travel back and forth between communities.
 A couple of weeks ago, Jackson announced she wanted to force returning snowbirds into quarantine under the authority of the municipal emergency order, which she declared. When told that would violate people's human rights, she moved to signs and rolling announcements to self-isolate by firefighters with loudspeakers driving in trucks through cottage areas in South Bruce Peninsula.
 Dave Craig lists about 150 rental cottages in Northern Bruce Peninsula through his Lion's Head-based RentCottage.com business. He spoke by phone in an interview before letters sent by the municipality would have reached him.
 A few weeks before Ontario's emergency pandemic order restricted stays in short-term rentals, Craig cancelled a dozen bookings and refused to book anything through the end of May. Four of his five employees had to be laid off.
 Any bookings made beyond May 31 could still be cancelled too, depending on the state of the health emergency, Craig said Tuesday.
 "We wouldn't want to be responsible for someone coming up from the city and spreading this thing through the community," he said. As the hospital has just four beds in Lion's Head, an influx of sick visitors would overwhelm it, he said.
 "I heard Premier Doug Ford strongly saying everybody just stay home, isolate. Don't be going up to cottage country where the healthcare systems are thin in the off-season especially . . . I totally agree with what they're doing."
 Quinn Ross, who helps run the "Bruce Peninsula Short Term Accommodations Group" Facebook site, said the 288 members on his page support efforts to limit visitors to their short-term rentals amid this public health emergency. There are more than 500 short-term accommodations on the peninsula.
 The group formed a year ago in response to Northern Bruce Peninsula's moves to regulate the short-term accommodation sector.
 "By and large, the industry, at least in Northern Bruce Peninsula, had already adopted these changes in advance of the province changing the policy statement," Ross said of the tightened provincial order.
 "Universally we accept the change and appreciate the change to the policy statement and we think anything that anything that helps in flattening the curve is something that we support."
 He said his members have removed availability through to April and some have blocked off availability into June. He's heard no complaints about doing so or speculation about long-term implications either, he said.
 Hotels and motels across Ontario continue to be deemed an essential service under the tightened provincial emergency order and they may continue to book any guests.
 Frank Anvziak, who owns the Top Notch Restaurant and Motel in Wiarton, said he's had a recent cancelled reservation but he supports the efforts to limit the virus's spread.
 He said he trusts the government's decisions to keep everyone safe, even if it's not the best for his business. "I have to believe in it. I am not the expert."
 It's an additional challenge at a time when people increasingly live paycheque to paycheque, he said.
 Asked if he's concerned for the viability of his business amid the COVID-19 outbreak, he said he'll do what he can to survive.
 "I don't know what is going to be. What I know is that I will do the best to save the business and serve the customers. But I cannot tell you what I am going to do because I don't know what's happened.
 "If you have a fire, you don't think about what you have in your house. Only you like to save your life."
 Dr. Ian Arra, the medical officer of health in Grey-Bruce, is one of many officials who have urged everyone to curtail all but essential travel during this pandemic.
 In the third week of March, municipal officials in Northern Bruce Peninsula asked visitors other than people who own cottages there to stay home to avoid spreading the virus.
 Huron-Kinloss, at southern extremity of Bruce County, last week used an emergency order to stop water from being turned on to discourage cottage owners from coming, again to limit spread of infection and help avoid overwhelming hospitals.

Edward M. Anderson Jr. Center Township Edward M. Anderson, Jr., 95, a lifelong resident of Center Township, passed away on Sunday, April 5, 2020, at his residence. Born in Center Township (Monaca), he was the son of the late Edward M., Sr. and Mary (Biskup) Anderson. With a strong desire to serve his country, Ed left home and entered the U.S. Army Air Corps at the tender age of 18. During his years of active duty, he proudly served with the Burma Bridge Busters in World War II. A strong provider to the family he loved, Ed was a carpenter by trade and also was employed at the Monaca Post Office from where he retired as the Postmaster with 29 years of service. In addition to his work, Ed was actively involved in many organizations within the community. Ed was a member of the North Branch Presbyterian Church, Center Township and a member and Past Master of the Monaca-Center F & A.M. Lodge # 791. A proud moment was when he was bestowed the honorary Scottish Rite 33 rd Degree for his meritorious service to craft masonry. Ed was also a member of the Valley of New Castle Scottish Rite Consistory; a member and Ambassador and Past Deputy of Syria Shrine; a member and past president of Beaver County Caravan - Syria Shrine; member and past president of Monaca-Center Fraternity Club; member and past commander of the Center Township VFW Post # 1821; and past president of the former Monaca-Center Lion's Club. Ed also held many special interest and hobbies. Born with a natural gift for music, he learned to play the organ, banjo, accordion, harmonica and piano. For many years, Ed shared his musical gifts by playing the organ for Masonic meetings and enjoyed performing for small functions throughout the community. He also was very talented in carpentry skills and fashioned a wide variety of projects and materials for the Masonic lodge, the church, his own home as well as the homes of his children. Ed was united in marriage to Ada Mae (Close) and shared 76 years of marriage. Together they raised three children, a daughter, Sandy (Bill) Casto of Chippewa Township and two sons, Edward (Chris) Anderson of Georgetown and the late Danny Anderson. Ed also leaves numerous grandchildren, great-grandchildren, special nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews. In addition to his parents, Edward was preceded in death by a son, Danny Anderson in 1992, and two sisters, Georgia Grogg and Mary Weigel Brobeck. A private visitation and service was held at SIMPSON FUNERAL & CREMATION SERVICES, 1119 Washington Ave., Monaca, (724) 728-4000, followed by burial in Sylvania Hills Memorial Park, Rochester. Memorial contributions may be made in Edward's memory to North Branch Presbyterian Church, Monaca, Good Samaritan Hospice, Valencia, Pa., or Syria Shrine, Pittsburgh, Pa. There is no doubt that Ed will be greatly missed and fondly remembered by his many special loved ones. Due to the current pandemic, a public memorial gathering to honor Ed's life will be planned at a later date.

The MacBook Air is the perfect Mac for most users offering ample power for everything from work to streaming. Amazon has the Core i5/8GB/256GB SSD model on sale for $999. That's $300 off and the best cheap MacBook Air deal we've seen for this configuration.View Deal
 Apple's lightweight MacBook Air is one of the best ultrabooks you can buy. This specific laptop on sale packs a 13.3-inch Retina Display, Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage.
 In our MacBook Air 2019 review, we liked its crisp, high-resolution Retina display and strong audio. While it only has two Thunderbolt 3 ports on board, we gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars.
 At 2.8 pounds, the 13.3-inch MacBook Air is on par with other travel laptops like the Dell XPS 13 (2.7 pounds) and the HP Spectre x360 (2.8 pounds). By comparison, it's a tad lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Pro (3 pounds).
 Performance-wise, the MacBook Air's CPU 8th-gen Intel Y-series chip and 8GB RAM combo is ideal for day-to-day multitasking, whether you're using it for school or work.
 Port-wise, the MacBook Air is equipped with two Thunderbolt 3 ports on its left side, one of which is for charging the notebook. It also has a built-in headphone jack so you can listen to music or podcasts using a wired pair of headphones.
 This cheap MacBook Air deal won't last long, so we recommend you snag one immediately.

DR. FAUCI:   Yeah, see that's unfortunate. We've got to be able to make sure that people understand the importance of social distancing. If you are in a critical infrastructure job, there are things that you can do. You heard us talk about it last week. The idea of wearing a face covering of some sort. It doesn't have to be a classical mass because you don't want to take away from the masks that the healthcare workers need. But if you're in a situation where it is difficult to stay six feet away or in a situation less than 10 people, which is what the guidelines say, then there are certain things that you could do and a mask is one of them. Also, you could stagger shifts, number factories of doing that instead of having just the daytime shift. Maybe go around the clock and have half the people come in in one shift and half the people come in the other to keep the distancing physically from each other. But I'm not a factory manager, but I'm just thinking of that as a possibility.

 Edward M. Anderson Jr. Center Township Edward M. Anderson, Jr., 95, a lifelong resident of Center Township, passed away on Sunday, April 5, 2020, at his residence. Born in Center Township (Monaca), he was the son of the late Edward M., Sr. and Mary (Biskup) Anderson. With a strong desire to serve his country, Ed left home and entered the U.S. Army Air Corps at the tender age of 18. During his years of active duty, he proudly served with the Burma Bridge Busters in World War II. A strong provider to the family he loved, Ed was a carpenter by trade and also was employed at the Monaca Post Office from where he retired as the Postmaster with 29 years of service. In addition to his work, Ed was actively involved in many organizations within the community. Ed was a member of the North Branch Presbyterian Church, Center Township and a member and Past Master of the Monaca-Center F & A.M. Lodge # 791. A proud moment was when he was bestowed the honorary Scottish Rite 33 rd Degree for his meritorious service to craft masonry. Ed was also a member of the Valley of New Castle Scottish Rite Consistory; a member and Ambassador and Past Deputy of Syria Shrine; a member and past president of Beaver County Caravan - Syria Shrine; member and past president of Monaca-Center Fraternity Club; member and past commander of the Center Township VFW Post # 1821; and past president of the former Monaca-Center Lion's Club. Ed also held many special interest and hobbies. Born with a natural gift for music, he learned to play the organ, banjo, accordion, harmonica and piano. For many years, Ed shared his musical gifts by playing the organ for Masonic meetings and enjoyed performing for small functions throughout the community. He also was very talented in carpentry skills and fashioned a wide variety of projects and materials for the Masonic lodge, the church, his own home as well as the homes of his children. Ed was united in marriage to Ada Mae (Close) and shared 76 years of marriage. Together they raised three children, a daughter, Sandy (Bill) Casto of Chippewa Township and two sons, Edward (Chris) Anderson of Georgetown and the late Danny Anderson. Ed also leaves numerous grandchildren, great-grandchildren, special nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews. In addition to his parents, Edward was preceded in death by a son, Danny Anderson in 1992, and two sisters, Georgia Grogg and Mary Weigel Brobeck. A private visitation and service was held at SIMPSON FUNERAL & CREMATION SERVICES, 1119 Washington Ave., Monaca, (724) 728-4000, followed by burial in Sylvania Hills Memorial Park, Rochester. Memorial contributions may be made in Edward's memory to North Branch Presbyterian Church, Monaca, Good Samaritan Hospice, Valencia, Pa., or Syria Shrine, Pittsburgh, Pa. There is no doubt that Ed will be greatly missed and fondly remembered by his many special loved ones. Due to the current pandemic, a public memorial gathering to honor Ed's life will be planned at a later date.

The list was compiled by projected signing bonuses because the publication believed it wasn't fair to players who have committed to a team and therefore aren't being evaluated by other teams.
 The 6-foot-2, 16-pound Hernandez, is one of seven shortstops ranked in the 10 top among projected signing bonuses.
 In last year's international draft in July, the Cubs drafted and signed catchers Ronnier Quintero and Brayan Altuve and shortstop Kevin Made to bonuses around $5.5 million. All three are ranked among the organization's top 24 prospects, according to Baseball America.
 The 2020 international draft is currently scheduled to be held on July 2, but Major League Baseball can postpone it as late as Jan. 15, 2021.

A watershed moment may be at hand because Washingtonians reacted early and sensibly to coronavirus.
 According to projections from the University of Washington‚Äôs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the state could be past the pandemic‚Äôs peak strain on hospitals and beyond the apex for the numbers of COVID-19 deaths per day.
 That solid statistical calculation is based on reported data ‚Äî and consideration of Washington state's measures to limit contagion. The projection relies on our residents' social distancing remaining a fixture of life through the end of May. If that holds, Washington could be slowly heading toward the downward slope of this tragic pandemic. More serious illnesses and deaths will occur, but disease spread is abating. Now more than ever, stay the course and stay home.
 Federal leadership failures notwithstanding, every state can learn from Washington's example. Incredibly, a handful of states still don't have stay- at-home orders in place. Monday, Washington became the 14th state to close all school sites for the remainder of the academic year. Our neighbors in Oregon and Idaho should hasten to join that list, providing families with certainty and adding another solid step in a brutally long path.
 Every sector of Washington society has paid an immense cost to reach this potential turning point. Sacrifices must continue for the curve to flatten instead of rise up again. The school closure is only one aspect of changed life that must remain in place through this month and the next. Business closures, careful shopping, industrious hand-washing and self-isolation until at least June are the price of saving lives.
 ‚ÄúYou can have the same number of fatalities on the backside of that curve as it is going down,‚Äù Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday after announcing the end of the on-campus K-12 academic year.

Many former members of the Gonzaga men‚Äôs basketball program have gone on to coach elsewhere: Ray Giacoletti, Leon Rice, Bill Grier, Donny Daniels, Kyle Bankhead, Ken Bone, John Jakus and Rem Bakamus, to name some.
 Many of those, like Daniels, had already established their careers elsewhere before coming to Spokane. Some, like Bankhead and Bakamus, were just starting theirs as players at Gonzaga.
 Each of the three said Gonzaga‚Äôs sustained success is unique, and while its manner of doing so isn‚Äôt the only model, it is certainly one that is difficult to replicate.
 ‚ÄúThe most remarkable thing is how long Gonzaga has sustained excellence through the years,‚Äù Daniels said.
 Daniels, 65, spent nine seasons at Gonzaga as an assistant coach up until the 2019-20 season, when he accepted a job at Utah as its director of player development.
 It‚Äôs his second stint at Utah, his first coming from 1990 to 2000 when the Utes reached the NCAA tournament eight times and the title game once. He also coached at Cal State Fullerton and UCLA.

While black residents make up about 29% of Chicago's population, a whopping 72% of the city's residents who have died from COVID-19 so far are black. And according to the public health commissioner, 52% of those testing positive are black.
 Health disparities and access to care play a key role. Many essential workers holding down jobs like driving buses, childcare or in grocery stores are black. As the pandemic continues to take a toll on health and economics, there are calls for addressing underlying racial inequities.
 Linda Rae Murray, a retired doctor who teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Public Health, said the high mortality rate for blacks doesn't surprise her.
 "It makes me furious. It makes me angry. The pandemic hits different populations differently," Murray said. "For African-Americans we have higher rates of diabetes, higher rates of blood pressure, coronary diseases and many other medical conditions that make people more vulnerable to having bad outcomes to this virus."
