 WOOSTER -- Western Reserve Group is positioned to lend a hand and contribute to the community's well-being, especially in tough times like these with the coronavirus pandemic, according to a news release from WRG.  
 So, WRG's executive management group brainstormed a number of organizations that could use support -- primarily focusing on services that provide assistance to children, survivors of domestic violence and filling the pantries of those who are struggling to make ends meet during these uncertain times. Of the organizations nominated, several were ultimately recommended and chosen by WRG's executive officers of the company, the release said.  
 WRG made donations to the following charitable organizations in the Wayne County area: Habitat for Humanity in Wayne County, Boys & Girls Club of Wooster, OneEighty, Inc., and Wooster Community Hospital's Covid-19 Relief Fund. WRG also donated to People to People Ministries, as its broader range of services supported WRG's mission of giving back to this community that has given us so much.  
 Not only did WRG donate $30,000 to these local nonprofits, it also continued to support local restaurants over the last few months -- spending over $7,000 to purchase lunches for its employees in hopes of sustaining some local businesses in the uncertain economy, according to the release, which added that WRG partnered with The City Square Steakhouse, Omahoma Bob's Barbeque, The Barn Restaurant, Gionino's Pizzeria, Spoon Market & Deli, Green Leaf Restaurant and Drive In, Basil Asian Bistro Wooster and Wild Ginger.  
 \"There are so many deserving businesses and causes in our community, it only seems right to make sure we do all we can to ensure they survive this challenge and come out stronger than before,\" WRG President and CEO Kevin Day, said in a prepared statement.

While prepaying on your mortgage may look attractive in the long run, it’s important to consider the downsides. If you decide to prepay on a monthly basis, you’re putting more of your salary into your mortgage payment and leaving less liquidity for other needs. Particularly for those with variable monthly income, prepayment may take up too much cash unnecessarily and put you at risk of not being able to cover a surprise expense.

Lionel Messi believes football will never be the same following the coronavirus pandemic.
 While the seasons were brought to an end in France and the Netherlands, football in Europe's major leagues is gradually returning behind closed doors.
 The Bundesliga resumed on May 16 and Messi and Barca will soon be able to recommence their quest to claim the title in LaLiga, which is poised to return on June 11.
 In England, the Premier League will restart on June 17, with Italy's Serie A set to get going again on June 20.
 However, the financial implications of the suspension and playing games without spectators in the stadiums will have a significant impact on clubs and competitions around the globe.
 Speaking to El Pais, Messi said: "I don't think football will ever be the same. But beyond football, I don't think life, in general, will ever be the same, either.
 "All of us that have experienced this situation will remember what happened in one way or another.
 "In my case, it's with a feeling of sorrow and frustration for those that have suffered the most due to the loss of loved ones.
 "I am sure that football and sport, in general, will be affected. Financially, because there are companies linked with the world of sport that will maybe experience some difficulties because of the coronavirus.
 "But also professionally, because with the return to training and competing, what was normal before now is going to be different. It will be a strange situation for us as athletes but also for anyone that has to change their usual work dynamic.
 "I am grateful to all of the people that are fighting to beat this virus in hospitals, health centres and care homes. Nearly all of us have doubts about how the world will be after everything that's happened.
 "Beyond the lockdown measures and the whole situation, which caught us by surprise, many people have had a really tough time because they've been directly affected.
 "People have lost family and friends and were not even able to say goodbye. There have been a lot of negatives to come from this crisis, but I don't think there's anything worse than losing your loved ones. That, for me, is hugely frustrating and unfair."

BOSTON -- Almost the entire state Senate wrote a letter to the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, saying that the Bay State needs more help from the federal government to weather the COVID-19 crisis and outlining priorities for a future stimulus package.
 Senate President Karen Spilka said in a Friday phone interview that a copy of the letter, signed by 39 senators, will also be sent to the Trump administration and that federal aid proved crucial to preserving government services in past recessions.
 "Back in 2009 and 2010, the only way we level-funded - during that big recession, the only way we level-funded our K-12 education system was because we got a billion dollars from the federal government in stimulus funds," said Spilka, who co-chaired the Economic Development Committee in 2009 and 2010. "In that time we lost $2.5 billion of our budget, which was not anywhere near where we are now."
 The steep and sudden economic downturn arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has knocked Beacon Hill's budget cycle off kilter. Normally at this point in the year, both the House and Senate would have passed their own versions of the state budget, setting up conference committee negotiations for a final spending plan.
 This year, budget debates have not yet been held, and the amount of revenue the state will have to spend in fiscal 2021 remains uncertain. Spilka said revenue estimates now range between $4 billion and $7 billion below the projections that served as a basis for the $44.6 billion budget Gov. Charlie Baker filed in January.
 "That is a significant chunk of our overall revenue for next year that we could lose," Spilka said. "We really need the federal government to help states out with education."
 Baker's budget proposed a $303.5 million increase in Chapter 70 aid to local K-12 schools, an amount he has said reflects the first installment of funding under a 2019 school finance reform law that called for a $1.5 billion injection of new funds over seven years.
 Asked if she believes it's still possible to fund the first year of that law given the new budgetary dynamics, Spilka said Ways and Means Committee chairs Sen. Michael Rodrigues and Rep. Aaron Michlewitz are "working well" together.
 "It still is a priority for us," she said. "They're working on it, and we're continuing to explore what options we have for a budget and for funding."
 The new fiscal year begins July 1, and a new set of emergency rules gives the House Ways and Means Committee until that day to report out its version of the budget. Legislative leaders have floated the idea of passing interim budgets to buy time for a full spending plan to be developed.
 The Senate's letter to Congress says that additional assistance from the federal government is necessary for Massachusetts "to weather this crisis in a manner that: maintains the services residents rely on; protects the health, education and other facilities that undergird our society; and strengthens the infrastructure of our economy, like child care, that we often take for granted."
 It is signed by Spilka and 38 other senators, including members of both parties and the two newest Democrats, Sens. Susan Moran and John Velis, who were sworn in Thursday. The only senator not to sign on was Ryan Fattman, R-Sutton.
 The letter expresses "strong support" for several provisions included in the $3 trillion stimulus package, dubbed the HEROES Act, that passed the U.S. House on May 15.
 Specifically, the senators backed measures including the bill's $500 billion in state fiscal relief and $250 billion in local fiscal relief; $100 billion in grants for health care providers; $100.15 billion for K-12 and higher education; $7 billion for the Child Care Development Block Grant and expansions to child care tax credits; premium pay for essential workers; another round of economic impact payments; and steps to help families maintain internet access and schools boost distance learning capabilities.
 "Although Massachusetts has built up the third largest stabilization fund in the nation, without the significant fiscal relief proposed in the HEROES Act, Massachusetts will not be able to balance its budget without major reductions that would undercut our ability to meet the needs of residents during this crisis," the letter said.
 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that there will likely be another COVID-19 relief bill, but said it will not be the same as what the House approved. "We're not going to be doing a $3 trillion bill. That won't happen," he said during a Tuesday event in Kentucky, according to The Hill.
 Massachusetts received about $2.7 billion in state and local government aid in the CARES Act, and about a quarter of those funds are currently being allocated to cities and towns.

LONDON -- British foreign minister Dominic Raab on Sunday defended the government's careful loosening of the coronavirus lockdown, saying it was the "right step to be taking" at this time.
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has come under fire from some scientists for easing a lockdown put in place 10 weeks ago, with several saying it was a premature and risky move in the absence of a fully functioning system to track new outbreaks.
 Britain has one of the world's highest death rates from COVID-19 and the government says it is easing the stringent lockdown cautiously to balance the need to restart the economy while also trying to prevent another increase in the number of infections.
 "We are confident that this is the right step to be taking at this moment in time," Raab told Sky News. "We are taking those steps very carefully, based on the science but also based on our ability now to monitor the virus."
 From Monday, up to six people will be able to meet outside in England, some school classes will restart, elite competitive sport can resume without spectators and more than 2 million people who have been "shielding" will be allowed to spend time outdoors.
 Housing minister Robert Jenrick said the government was "reasonably confident" the easing would not boost the rate of infection, but some pictures of people apparently flouting the new rules has caused concern.
 England's deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, emphasized the need for people to remain on their guard.
 "This is a really, really critical time. So where we are seeing (that) government is easing measures, the public really, really need to stick to those measures," she told a news conference.
 Johnson, meanwhile, is under pressure from some in his governing Conservative Party and businesses to start reopening the economy after spending billions to help to protect companies and workers from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
 At the heart of the strategy to ease the lockdown is a system to test and trace those people who have come into contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19.
 On Sunday, the government said it had met its 200,000 capacity testing target, including the means for 40,000 antibody tests a day, which health minister Matt Hancock described as "an important milestone."
 Ministers also say the tracing system is already working, though some scientists warned that it is too early to say whether it is fit for purpose and fear that it might not be able to cope if the lockdown easing increases the transmission rate.
 Britain has recorded more than 38,000 deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases. The Office of National Statistics and other sources of data put the figure of fatalities from suspected and confirmed cases at 48,000.
 Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group and who sits on the government's scientific advisory group, said he shared other scientists' "deep concern."
 "I think unlocking too fast carries a great risk that all the good work that has been put in by everyone to try to reduce transmission may be lost," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.
 Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has offered the nation slightly different guidance to that in England, agreed with scientists urging caution.
 "I agree with the opinion that has been expressed over the weekend that we've got to be very cautious," Sturgeon told Sky News. "This virus hasn't gone away, there is still a significant risk that it could run out of control again."

The reason test and tracing is so important is precisely because it allows us to take targeted measures which means as we open up the economy people’s lives [are] going a bit more closer to normal, we can be sure that we’ve got the thing under control,” he told the BBC.
