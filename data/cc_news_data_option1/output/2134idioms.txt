It’s heartbreaking that we’re honoring yet another life that was lost due to the violence and racism our country displays far too often. To say that racism is alive today would be a gross understatement, and to say that white privilege doesn’t exist is ignorance at its finest. We live in a country that denies the same freedom and rights to someone based on the color of their skin… black men, women and children are being MURDERED because of the color of their skin while white men, women and children majority of the time receive a slap on the wrist at best. I am tired, I’m angry, I’m sad, and I will not stay quiet. Changes need to be made, and people need to be behind bars for their actions.. Rest In Peace George Floyd.

This plant, however, may have enough vigor left in it to regrow and fill in. I don’t see any sprouts from below, so trimming it flush to the soil isn’t a good option. I’d recommend removing all the dead wood and reshaping what’s left as necessary.

You might think it was an election day by how busy things have been at the Wagoner County Election Board. However, the June 30 election is almost a month away.
 Samantha Call, Election Board Secretary, has been busy because of the number of applications for an Absentee Ballot.
 In a normal year, there are a normal amount of requests, but due to the COVID-19 virus, the Absentee Ballot has become a popular option for those that wish to vote from their home.

A separate survey carried out by Centre for Science and Environment showed that use of public transport may fall for six months. The survey included over 400 middle and high-income groups in Delhi and surrounding NCR cities. The analysis showed that preference for car ownership and usage will increase in the short run. (Read more here)Another survey by market research and analysis firm Velocity MR stated that 62% respondents had said they would avoid cab- hailing firms like Ola and Uber. This survey had a sample size of 3,000 and covered categories including shopping habits, purchase habits, travel, social activities, investments, social responsibilities during this pandemic. (Read more here)It is important to note here that there could be several factors at play which decide on the preference patterns and voting choices when it comes to observing patterns in private vs public transportation in Covid-19 times. Work from home, buying capacity, possession/ownership of vehicles from before Covid-19 and similar factors can influence decisions on whether to shun public transportation or not. In the CSE survey for instance, among the 36% respondents who do not own any vehicle, around 28% said they may want to buy one for safety reasons in the near future. Yet, 73% respondents have preferred to move to public transport if it meets high quality standards for services.Most surveys, therefore, are only indicative at best.With current times of uncertainty, new vehicle purchases are likely to remain limited even if people look at avoiding public modes of transportation. Rating agency CRISIL recently predicted another year of double-digit decline in the Indian automotive industry. With job cuts or retrenchments, or even the possibility of these, there is a strong indication that people would most likely cancel or push back plans of vehicle purchases. CRISIL elaborated that since passenger vehicle segment has a high finance penetration of 78% to 80% and because of income uncertainty, the number of customers opting to take loans would decline.Shunning public transportation and also canceling plans of new purchases could give a boost to the used-car segment, a possibility that has resulted in companies like Maruti, Volkswagen and even luxury car maker Audi further strengthening their respective pre-owned business.The course that people opt to take in India and the world over from hereon remains to be seen and while there are not many who are denying use of public transportation will go down in the foreseeable future, the resultant benefit of this for OEMs is an ambiguous question only time will answer.",

On Monday, Lee released a short film titled "3 Brothers" connecting the death of Radio Raheem (played by Bill Nunn) in "Do the Right Thing" to the deaths of Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck as he begged for air. Garner's dying plea of "I can't breathe" became a rallying cry against police brutality in 2014.

This isn’t the first time Paul — or his brother, Logan Paul — have tried to profit off human suffering. The last time Logan got in big trouble was for filming a dead body in Japan’s “suicide forest” in 2018, and a brief perusal of Jake Paul’s history shows that his perspective on social issues ranges from limited to totally nonexistent. Do you want to take your cues on protest etiquette from someone who once said that anxiety is self-manifested?
 Beyond Paul’s 20 million YouTube subscribers, he also has 13.1 million on Instagram and 3.7 million on Twitter. He is constantly posting _something,_ usually multiple videos a week that garner millions of views each. He is prolific, and despite being uninteresting, he has a rabid fandom. He could do something meaningful with his massive platform, but no. Instead, like clockwork, every few months, he does something that gets him in trouble, and he revels in it. Because to Paul, attention — good or bad — is all the currency he wants.
 I’m as guilty of giving him that as anyone else — as a journalist, I’ve contacted Paul’s representatives to ask for profile access or interviews for a story every time he does something stupid. The term “cancel culture” gets thrown around a lot, a buzzword that rarely means anything because the people who have been supposedly canceled still get to do standup at establishment clubs, still get major motion picture roles, and still get to write books. But in the world of YouTube, you really can cancel someone by refusing to give them your time and your energy.

On a sunny Friday morning, Valleyview Public School kindergarten students get together for a fun day making bird nests -- over Zoom.
 Students talk about what they made their bird nests out of -- some say toilet paper rolls, fake grass, coffee filters and twigs.
 "Why didn't we use coffee filters?" one student asks when hearing one of her classmates used the common kitchen item.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the classroom into a virtual setting, with schools remaining closed until the end of June.
 Over the last few weeks, students have been learning about the life cycle and have gravitated towards learning about farm animals. Kindergarten teacher Kate Mays said when they find a topic the kids enjoy, they stick with it and try to incorporate it into their learning.
 Mays and Carole McLuckie ask students to show off the nests they've built. Students throw their hands up and wait for their mic to be unmuted to talk about what they made their nests out of.
 Mays and McLuckie both credited parents for their help unmuting mics, flipping the camera around and solving technological issues. Kiera Drew quipped that she enjoyed all the extra time she got to spend with her parents. Without parents, Valleyview kindergarten students doing Zoom, an online video conference app, would run into some problems.
 From the comforts of their kitchens, back yards and living rooms, students get some semblance of what normal classroom life is like. At the beginning of today's session, the school's librarian, Shelby Wickham, read the students a story. It's an activity she normally would do with students, except instead of them gathering on a carpet in front of Wickham they listen intently in a virtual classroom.
 "It's not normal to teach like this, but we make sure to do some things we do in class to get some consistency," McLuckie said.
 Last week, students did an egg drop challenge, which was universally loved. The egg drop challenge was meant to test kids in the STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math fields.
 For students with limited internet access, Mays said they have found workarounds. The Keewatin Patricia District School Board provided Google Chromebooks to students when it was announced they would be doing most of their learning online.
 Mays said they have been able to record Zoom lessons, such as math Mondays and writing Wednesdays so students can access it if they are unable to tune in live. As well, KPDSB developed a print shop so teachers can print out and mail assignments for students who find it easier to do their work on paper.
 "When we were planning how to deliver our instruction, we were mindful of the bandwidth demands of certain apps and websites and have only chosen to use those that work for all of our families," Mays said.
