Gov. Gavin Newsom acted properly in issuing his March 12 order that (among other things) suspended the portions of the Brown Act that require members of government decision-making bodies to be physically present in the same meeting room, and requiring physical public access to those meetings. City councils, boards of supervisors, school boards, police commissions and all manner of other government agencies have to act to address the emergency while keeping pace with their regular business. And they have to do it without jeopardizing their safety or that of the public.
 But as they move forward, they’d better err on the side of transparency, participation and disclosure. That means they should give timely advance public notice of matters to be considered, and they should seek every opportunity — through technology or creativity — to permit more fulsome public input. A time of crisis like this one is exactly when citizens need to hear most from their elected representatives and when they must absolutely be able to register their concerns.
 But government will do that only if the public demands it. Many public officials are contemptuous of open-meeting laws. The Los Angeles City Council long had a practice of barring the public from weighing in at “special meetings,” such as Friday’s, convened on 24 hours’ notice instead of the usual 72. The council argued that it had already given the public the opportunity to testify at committee meetings — where actions have less impact, only a few council members are present to hear the input and decisions are lower profile.
 That practice aced the public out of meaningful opportunities to present their objections and opinions to the full council on important issues, including proposed real estate developments. In a ruling last year, an appeals court struck down the no-testimony rule as contrary to the Brown Act.

NEW YORK (AP) -- As in-person worship services are canceled or downsized amid the coronavirus outbreak, some churches across the U.S. are bracing for a painful drop in weekly contributions and possible cutbacks in programs and staff.
 One church leader, Bishop Paul Egensteiner of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's Metropolitan New York Synod, said some of the 190 churches in his region were unlikely to survive because of a two-pronged financial hit. Their offerings are dwindling, and they are losing income from tenants such as preschools which can no longer afford to rent church venues.
 "As much as I'd like to help them, everybody's reserves are taking a hit because of the stock market," Egensteiner said.
 At Friendship Baptist Church in Baltimore, a mostly African American congregation of about 1,100, the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. bucked the cancellation trend by holding services last Sunday. But attendance was down by about 50%, and Gwynn said the day's offering netted about $5,000 compared to a normal intake of about $15,000.
 "It cuts into our ministry," he said. "If this keeps up, we can't fund all our outreach to help other people."
 There was a brighter outcome at the Church of the Resurrection, a large United Methodist Church congregation that operates out of five locations in the Kansas City area.
 Cathy Bien, the church's communications director, said about 25,700 people logged in to join online worship last Sunday after in-person services were canceled. That compared to normal Sunday participation of 14,000 worshippers -- 8,000 in person and 6,000 online.
 "It blew our minds," Bien said. "They were coming from all over the country -- a lot of Methodists from other churches."
 The huge turnout didn't translate into a larger than normal offering, although the church is still processing checks that were sent by some of the worshippers, Bien said. She expressed hope that financial support will remain robust as the church stresses the need to bolster food pantries and other community programs in the face of COVID-19.
 At Trinity Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, Virginia, giving was down modestly last weekend as the church cancelled in-person worship and made the service available online.
 The pastor, Walter Kim, said some of his roughly 1,000 congregants have grown accustomed to online giving in recent years, but many worshippers still give in person at the services -- an option not available for now.
 "We'll be asking them to sign up (for online giving) or mail a check," said Kim. He will be urging congregants to bolster the church's "mercy fund" for use assisting hard-up members of the community as job losses multiply.
 In addition to his pastoral duties Kim is president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents more than 45,000 evangelical churches. The NAE will be co-hosting a two-day digital summit next week featuring videos from church leaders advising other pastors nationwide how to respond creatively and effectively to the virus outbreak.
 The co-host is the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College in Illinois, which already has offered resources to churches in response to COVID-19.
 "Some changes are going to be required," Kim said. "The church is a very creative institution. In the end it will find ways of fulfilling its mission."
 In Western Massachusetts, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield has indefinitely canceled all public Masses, and recently rescinded permission for parishioners to pray individually at their churches.
 Funeral Masses were still allowed with a maximum attendance of 25; the diocese said the times of those Masses were not to be shared in the media,
 "Lack of access to the churches and Eucharist is particularly difficult for many older parishioners whose entire daily routine is built around getting up, out of the house, and going to Mass," said the Rev. Mark Stelzer, who has served in the diocese as a parish priest and college chaplain.
 The Rev. William Tourigny, pastor of Ste. Rose de Lima Church in Chicopee, Massachusetts, said his parish had a solid financial foundation and expected it could maintain all programs and staff payroll for the time being.
 "For smaller faith-based communities with little or no reserved funds, difficult decisions will need to be made," he said.
 Joe Wright, executive director of the Bivocational and Small Church Leadership Network in Nashville said many pastors in the network have been holding regular in-person services, while monitoring the spread of the virus.
 "Once the coronavirus rises to the level where it starts hitting smaller groups, then we'll see even the smaller groups back away and seek ways to gather, probably electronically," he said.
 When that happens, Wright said, financial giving will depend on the church, especially the age of the congregations.
 "Some churches with older congregations do not give electronically so the transition to that will be a little bit harder," he said.
 Ron Klassen, executive director of Rural Home Missionary Association, said it's too early to say how the rural churches he represents are being impacted.
 "My sense is that in the past, people rise up and, if anything, the giving might increase," he said. "People are going to give. They'll take care of their church and their community."
 In Baltimore, pastor Gwynn worries that tensions might rise past the point that church outreach programs can help.
 "With all the uncertainty, I'm afraid this could turn into anarchy," he said. "Not everybody's patient. Not everybody's law abiding."
 He even envisioned the possibility of a stampede toward the goods being doled out after church's annual food drive.
 "My biggest fear right now is what's happening to the minds of our people," Gwynn said. "How long can we hold them together?'

Cuomo has burnished his reputation as a leader, particularly in light of Trump’s criminal mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak. It will go down in history how Trump fired his entire pandemic response team before the crisis, and kicked the CDC out of the National Security Council. Trump could have begun to use a functioning test from the World Health Organization in early February, but didn’t; and he could have allowed private hospitals and labs to quickly develop their own coronavirus tests, but didn’t. Even as the U.S. fell behind, Trump leaned on his oldest strategy -- deny, deny, deny -- which in the end will have led to thousands of preventable deaths. As recently as March 10, Trump said, “It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.”

MURRAY, WILLIAM "BILL" CRAWFORD Passed away in his London home on Wednesday, March 25, 2020 at the age of 74. Born on November 16, 1945, Bill spent his formative years in London and graduated from the University of Western Ontario. Although he spent many years living in Toronto and Florida, his hometown always held a special place in his heart, and he happily spent his last years living in London. A master of reinvention, Bill changed careers many times and in 2010 he was appointed to the Social Benefits Tribunal, where he had a reputation for being both compassionate and fair. He parlayed his love of politics into a career of over twenty years at Queen's Park where he held various roles including Assistant to the Whip, and Director of Operations for the Liberal Party. He always had time for the junior members of his team, who he loved mentoring, and could often be found raising a glass with colleagues at local watering holes. A kind and genuine man with a great sense of humour, Bill had an endless curiosity about the world and never stopped learning new things. He is survived by his wife Mary Lou, his sister Judy Thompson (Rod), his daughters, Kim and Liz (Chris), his stepsons Darren (Melissa) and Craig (Heather) and his beloved grandchildren Alexa, Bobby, Katie, Isabelle, Madalynn and Holly. He will also be greatly missed by his nieces and nephew and extended family and friends. Predeceased by his parents Gib and Beryl Murray and his brother David (Connie). He fought a brave battle, never complained and went peacefully. Rest well, Billy, we love you. Given the current need for social distancing, a celebration of his life will be planned when possible in Toronto. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The Kidney Foundation of Canada. Arrangements entrusted with A. Millard George Funeral Home, 519-433-5184. Online condolences, memories and photographs shared at www.amgfh.com

Go climb a tree! So goes the idiom. The families and villagers of seven migrant labourers returning home to Balarampur village in West Bengal's Purulia district told them just that, literally.
 Taking the coronavirus outbreak and the media campaign about social distancing seriously, the villagers asked these men to make trees their home during the self-quarantine. According to local MLA, Shantiram Mahato, the labourers had returned last Friday and were advised self- quarantine for 14 days as a precaution against COVID-19.
 "As they did not have enough space in their homes to maintain social distancing, it was decided they will live on trees for the time being," he said. Cots were arranged which they tied to the branches and plastic sheets were placed over them to protect them from rain.
 A separate space was marked for them outside the village where they could relieve themselves, bathe and wash clothes, a member of the local panchayat said. They would climb down the trees thrice daily to have meals, and for answering natures call. Blankets and clothes were provided by us, Bijoy Singh Laha, whose brother was among them, said.
 He said after the seven returned from Chennai, doctors advised them to stay under home-quarantine for 14 days and follow social distancing. Since their houses had few rooms, the villagers hit upon the idea that they take shelter on trees.
 However, as social media got abuzz with their photos and videos, the local administration stepped in and shifted them to a quarantine facility on Saturday..

BUFFALO -- After her sixth-grade son's school in Buffalo closed amid the coronavirus outbreak, Roxanne Ojeda-Valentin returned to campus with shopping bags to take home textbooks and weeks' worth of assignments prepared by teachers.
   
 A single mother with a full-time job, she now joins millions of parents around the country -- and the world -- suddenly thrust into the role of their children's primary educators, leaving them scrambling to sift through educational resources and juggle lesson plans with jobs and other responsibilities.
   
 "It's a really big experiment," Ojeda-Valentin said as she left the school, her second stop after picking up materials from her fourth-grade daughter's school.
   
 Even in school districts that are providing remote instruction, the burden falls on parents to keep their children on task. In others, parents are left to find educational websites and curricular materials on their own. And while the challenges are daunting for all, they can be nearly impossible to overcome for parents limited by access to technology and their own levels of education.
   
 Across the United States, more than 118,000 public and private schools in 45 states have closed, affecting 53 million students, according to a tally kept by Education Week. While many closures were initially announced as short-term, parents are wondering if schools will reopen this academic year as the outbreak intensifies.
   
 After Kansas became the first state to announce schools would remain closed for the year, a task force recommended from 30 minutes of work a day for the youngest students to up to three hours daily for students in sixth grade and up. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also has urged the state's more than 6 million schoolchildren and their families to make long-term plans, telling them few, if any, schools would reopen before summer.
   
 Los Angeles father Filiberto Gonzalez's three children have daily contact with their teachers and one to four hours of work they can do on an existing online platform that supplements classes. But he never thought the arrangement would transform from a stopgap measure to permanent situation.
   
 "The news ... was a real shock to a lot of us," he said.
   
 In Portland, Oregon, Katie Arnold's 7-year-old son has been spending his days in his mother's office, keeping busy on an iPad and her laptop while she's managing accounts for a catering company.
   
 Oregon has shut down schools through April 28 and some districts have put optional activities online, though they are not meant to replace the regular curriculum. While her son's district explores virtual learning, she has been combing the internet and tapping friends for suggestions.
   
 "Scholastic had a bunch of free things and I have a friend who's a teacher, so I've gotten a lot of workbook pages for him to do, just to try to keep him busy," said Arnold, who also has been using educational websites like ABCmouse.
   
 Arnold is making plans with other parents to teach children in small groups if the closure is extended, and is resigned to the idea that her workdays will be followed by evening school sessions.
   
 "We'll muster through it," she said.
   
 Some parents are turning to those with experience homeschooling for guidance, unsure of whether to enforce strict schedules and where to look for academic help. Amid an influx of interest, the National Home School Association dropped its membership fee from $39 to $10 for access to tip sheets and teaching materials, executive director Allen Weston said.
   
 The online site Outschool saw 20,000 new students enroll during a single weekend in March, compared to the 80,000 who have attended class since its 2017 launch, CEO Amir Nathoo said. The company offers live, teacher-led online classes beginning at $5 each, but has also offered free webinars on running online classes through video conferencing.
   
 Child development researcher Jessica Logan and her husband continue to work full-time from home and have been tag-teaming school-related questions from their 8- and 12-year-old children, home from Columbus City Schools in Ohio.
   
 "I see all these people writing out, 'Here are the six hours we're going to spend each day doing homework,' and was like, 'Not happening in my house,'" she said. "When am I going to get my work done? I still have my own work to do, so does my husband. Neither of us can take the entire day off to sit with them and do math worksheets or science experiments."
   
 "All parents are in the same boat," Logan said. "Your kid is not going to fall behind if they don't do these assignments every day."
   
 Nevertheless, Vancouver, Washington, teacher Renee Collins has committed to keeping not only her own 10- and 8-year-old children on track academically, but two of her friend's children and a second-grade neighbor as well.
   
 "We're going to do Monday, Tuesday and Thursday with the five kids together and the other days I'll do individually with (her own kids). So we'll do five days," she said.
   
 "The one thing that kind of gives a lot of us comfort," said Collins who teaches middle-school math, "is that it's not just our state. It's our entire nation. It's not just going to be the state of Washington that's behind. It's not just going to be my children that are going to be behind. It's going to be everybody."

CHICAGO -- My children have known for years that, when I die, I want to be quickly cremated and split evenly among my loved ones. They know I'd prefer a film festival to a funeral, but fancy death plans give hope only to the dying, while funerals provide comfort and fellowship to those left behind.
 It is also established family canon that the younger son gets my exquisite playing card collection, and the older son gets my extensive tarot card collection. My husband gets my books and our daughter's ashes.
 He understands, though begrudgingly, that no matter how old he is when I die, he is to look for love again, because I don't want him to be alone. Similarly, my sons know that I want them to grieve with the knowledge that, after a while, the wounds will heal and they'll not only survive, but thrive.
 Sure, I'm ghoulish -- who talks to their kids about death from when they're young, stage-directing dad's dating life from beyond the grave? But if I die unexpectedly, at least my last moments will not be filled with the fear that my most-loved will be left rudderless or confused about what I "would have wanted."
 This kind of radical openness about death is not for everyone. For instance, I don't share it with my parents, who, based on their own upbringing, seem to fear that talking about death actually invites it.
 Whenever the subject comes up, they get upset -- my mom, particularly. As a result, I have no idea what her wishes are. Burial? Cremation? Repatriation to Mexico to be buried alongside her mother? A funeral for her family there?
 Same for my dad. I have no idea what he wants, and it's clear that he'd sooner poke himself in the eye than have to endure such a conversation.
 As a result, my parents will probably end up with (BEG ITAL)my(END ITAL) wishes for them rather than their own for their final days. Everything from whether to be put on a ventilator if necessary, when to "pull the plug" or whether "do not resuscitate" orders should be signed.
 This is not the way to go. But it's a compact most of us make with each other, because talking about death is, for most people, so uncomfortable that "whatever happens, happens" is good enough at any given moment.
 Ellen Goodman, a Pulitzer Prize winner for commentary, whose columns were syndicated by The Washington Post, co-founded The Conversation Project in 2010. It's a nonprofit organization with the aim of helping start these incredibly difficult talks with loved ones.
 "My mom was one of those people who could talk about your problems until you were bored with them. We talked about everything except one thing: how she wanted to live at the end of her life," Goodman wrote on theconversationproject.org. "The last thing my mom would have wanted was to force me into such bewildering, painful uncertainty about her life and death. I realized only after her death how much easier it would have all been if I heard her voice in my ear as these decisions had to be made. If only we had talked about it."
 On the website, there are free "starter kits" about how to actually begin conversations about death and dying with your loved ones and choosing (or serving as) a health care proxy -- someone who will speak to medical personnel about your end-of-life wishes.
 There are also kits to help you talk with your doctor about your final wishes and to talk to family members who may already be suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia. There's also a kit for having conversations with seriously ill children.
 Some are available in up to 13 languages and most in at least English, Spanish and Chinese. There's even an audio version of the main kit, for starting the process of talking about death and dying.
 It's not a happy or uplifting topic, but it does have a particular resonance in this time of pandemic and suffering from unexpected disease.
 Obviously the very best outcome, and my wish for everyone, is that no one in your immediate family gets sick or dies from COVID-19.
 But a good consolation prize would be for people to have these difficult conversations so no one passes away feeling that they took up a resource best spent on someone with better odds or, alternately, sorrowful that their life was not fought for hard enough.

 MURRAY, WILLIAM BILL CRAWFORD Passed away in his London home on Wednesday, March 25, 2020 at the age of 74. Born on November 16, 1945, Bill spent his formative years in London and graduated from the University of Western Ontario. Although he spent many years living in Toronto and Florida, his hometown always held a special place in his heart, and he happily spent his last years living in London. A master of reinvention, Bill changed careers many times and in 2010 he was appointed to the Social Benefits Tribunal, where he had a reputation for being both compassionate and fair. He parlayed his love of politics into a career of over twenty years at Queen's Park where he held various roles including Assistant to the Whip, and Director of Operations for the Liberal Party. He always had time for the junior members of his team, who he loved mentoring, and could often be found raising a glass with colleagues at local watering holes. A kind and genuine man with a great sense of humour, Bill had an endless curiosity about the world and never stopped learning new things. He is survived by his wife Mary Lou, his sister Judy Thompson (Rod), his daughters, Kim and Liz (Chris), his stepsons Darren (Melissa) and Craig (Heather) and his beloved grandchildren Alexa, Bobby, Katie, Isabelle, Madalynn and Holly. He will also be greatly missed by his nieces and nephew and extended family and friends. Predeceased by his parents Gib and Beryl Murray and his brother David (Connie). He fought a brave battle, never complained and went peacefully. Rest well, Billy, we love you. Given the current need for social distancing, a celebration of his life will be planned when possible in Toronto. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The Kidney Foundation of Canada. Arrangements entrusted with A. Millard George Funeral Home, 519-433-5184. Online condolences, memories and photographs shared at www.amgfh.com

But instead, agribusinesses are willing to conduct massive planet-destroying deforestation, exploit workers for poverty wages and expose them to toxins and disease, and pave the way for viruses to spread to human populations, all in the name of profit. In the capitalist system, these agribusinesses are permitted to externalize the costs (financial and otherwise) to ecosystems, animals, consumers, farmworkers, and governments, and would not be able to survive if they had to foot the bill themselves. The $5 trillion agribusiness industry is in a “strategic alliance with influenza,” argues evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace, as it uses its immense wealth and power to continue these dangerous and unethical practices that give rise to disease.

Like so many other things, the regular collection of census information for the once-in-10-year national count has been made more difficult because of the fight against the spread of COVID-19.
 Some deadlines have changed, but because so much rides on the count -- including federal reimbursements to cities -- state and local officials are still working to make sure people get counted.
 "It is extremely important that everyone knows how important it is to get counted in the 2020 Census," said Patrick Laughlin, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Human Services, which is helping promote the federal census. "Completing the census will ensure that Illinoisans get both representation and federal funding for the critical things like roads, hospitals, schools and fire stations. In light of COVID-19, we encourage everyone who can to complete the census online at www.my2020census.gov, or by calling 844-330-2020.
 Starting March 12, households across the country were sent invitations to respond to the census questionnaire at the website or by telephone.
 Val Yazell, director of the city of Springfield's office of planning and economic development, also heads a local "complete count committee" of government and community leaders trying to get everyone to participate.
 "Luckily … we've had a lot of outreach," Yazell said, before the virus caused many facilities to close and the state's stay-at-home order, which runs through at least April 7. She said there was a Census Sunday in churches a few weeks ago, where houses of worship were encouraged to provide information in bulletins and elsewhere. There was also a luncheon at the Helping Hands shelter, where Yazell said she and five or six volunteers talked with people about the process.
 Yazell said she was able to give several presentations about the census, and her committee also got information out through schools.
 "District 186 has been a great partner," she said.
 But she said other plans, like having computers available in "safe census spaces," including the city library have gone by the wayside with buildings closed.
 At the University of Illinois Springfield, classes are being taught remotely, but many students are no longer in the campus dorms, townhouses or apartments. UIS will include those students in the count they provide to the Census Bureau, UIS spokesman Derek Schnapp said. And students are being told that even if they are off campus on the official Census Day, April 1 -- they should report their residence as where they live and sleep most of the time - at school.
 Nationally, there have been tentative changes to deadlines, which are subject to further adjustment, because of COVID-19.
 People are strongly encouraged to respond online, though questionnaires can be completed by phone or mail. The Census Bureau had expected people to respond by July 31 but because of the virus Aug. 14 is the new date.
 Census staff in-person assistance and home visits also have been delayed until at least mid-May.
 So far, the self-response rate -- those who have filled out the form themselves online, by phone or by mail -- stands at just over 29%, according to Census data provided online. As of Thursday, Knox County is seeing a rate of 37.5%, while Warren County's rate is 43.4%. The rate for Galesburg is 39.1%, while Monmouth is 45.4%.
 The questionnaire takes about 10 minutes to complete. The information is used to produce statistics. The Census Bureau is not permitted to publicly release individual responses in a way that can identify a household.
 Yazell said she's still working with the count committee to get the word out, and will be using more social media to inform people about the process.
 COVID-19 has "absolutely" caused problems, she said. "It's just caused challenges in making sure we can get the message out."

Teddy Bridgewater didn't get the usual introduction that accompanies a team's new starting quarterback. There was no podium to stand behind, no fresh new jersey with his name on the back.
   
 Instead, the quarterback's first press conference as a Carolina Panther was conducted virtually, with reporters logging on to a conference call to ask questions. With social distancing measures in place to attempt and reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the NFL as a result shutting down all team facilities, that's the reality.
   
 The other reality is that Bridgewater, 27, is now the No. 1 guy in town after signing a three-year, $63 million contract. But being the guy doesn't mean he's Cam Newton. This isn't Superman walking back through the door.
   
 "Teddy Bridgewater is just the OG, always cool, always calm," he said when describing himself in relation to Newton being Superman.
   
 Having spent the last two years as the backup in New Orleans, 2020 will be his first opportunity to start since suffering a major non-contact injury to his left leg just prior to the 2016 season with the Vikings, who drafted him 32nd overall in 2014 out of Louisville. He'll be playing in a division with some of the NFL's best quarterbacks -- Drew Brees, Tom Brady and Matt Ryan, and he knows what he's up against.
   
 "I'm a competitor and I feel like I'm in elite company. For me, I feel like I'm the only one who hasn't proved himself in this league. I feel like there's an opportunity for me," Bridgewater said. "Being in a division with two guys who've won MVPs, two guys who have won Super Bowls, that's a great feeling to be among those guys, but I just have to work hard and try to get up to those guys' levels. But at the end of the day, I have to be Teddy, be the best version of Teddy and the rest will take care of itself."
   
 Bridgewater proved himself during a five-game stretch last season in which he had to fill in for an injured Brees, leading the team to a 5-0 record and completing 69.7 percent of his passes, throwing nine touchdowns to two interceptions. In Carolina, he rejoins former Saints offensive assistant Joe Brady, who's now the team's offensive coordinator.
   
 "It was a unique situation. You look at the roster, a ton of playmakers, a lot of guys who bring a ton of energy to the building, a ton of excitement, you look at a guy like Joe Brady, who I was able to spend some time with, coach Matt Rhule, played against him when I was in college," Bridgewater said of choosing to join the Panthers. "There were some relationships developed prior to making the decision and I'm just happy that I have the opportunity to play and have the opportunity to be part of the Carolina Panthers."
   
 Being comfortable working with Brady, 30, won't be a problem. Bridgewater was traded to the Saints from the Jets just prior to the start of the 2018 season. Because everyone was busy getting Brees ready, Brady, 30, was left to teach him the offense and help him get ready.
   
 "(Brady) was the guy that actually taught me everything when I first got to New Orleans," Bridgewater said. "Joe was a guy who worked with me after practice, in the pregame, he was the guy who took me through drills, we went on the call sheet together and he just stayed active with me."
   
 There's a lot of quarterbacks that Bridgewater can and will be compared to, and Newton is inevitably one of them. When it comes to replacing the franchise's best quarterback, Bridgewater called the situation "unique." He has a relationship with Newton and the two talked at the Super Bowl earlier this year, but they haven't spoken over the past two weeks.
   
 "I'm aware of the situation that I'm coming into, it's a unique situation. For me, all I can do is continue to be myself," Bridgewater. "When I was in New Orleans, I was behind a guy named Drew Brees, I knew that when Drew got injured I had big shoes to fill then. I just constantly reminded myself to just be you. Be the best version of Teddy that I can be. By doing so, it allowed me to be a better teammate, better football player and a better person."
   
 Bridgewater is looking forward and is eager to start playing football again -- that is, whenever he can get to Charlotte. He's spending his days stuck at home in Miami working out, running the three flights of stairs in his house and playing old video games on his Nintendo 64 and PlayStation 2.
   
 Getting to know his new teammates has been reserved to text messages and gaining familiarity of his new weapons by looking online and playing Madden. (Which has only made him more excited about the targets he has to work with in Christian McCaffrey, DJ Moore, Curtis Samuel and the team's new big signing, Robby Anderson.) A kid in a candy store, as he referred to himself. Hopefully in reality rather than virtually sometime soon.
   
 "It's very exciting to be able to put your hard work back on display," Bridgewater said. "I'm eager to get started, honored to be a part of a great organization and I'm just thankful that those guys believed in me."

If you have been told to stay home from work, school, unnecessary trips to town or even hanging out with friends: Please, stay home.
 It doesn’t matter what age you are or what kind of immune system you have. The virus is spreading, and we have to do all that we can in order to slow it. By going out and about you are being selfish. Youth say if they get it it will be just an ordinary cold. Maybe for them. But what about your grandma and grandpa? You literally could kill them because you wanted to go and see your friends.
 Stay inside and keep you and your loved ones happy.

A guy is driving down a country road when he notices a chicken running right next to his car.
 (Neither the guy nor the chicken is racing to hoard stuff. Just thought it’s important you know that.)
 “That’s one fast chicken,” the guy thinks. “Let’s see how fast he can go.” So he speeds up, and the chicken’s still running right right next to his car. Only now that the chicken is in full stride, the guy notices the chicken has three legs.
 “OK, three-legged chicken,” he says. “Let’s see how fast you really are.”
 So he hits the gas, and in an instant, the chicken runs past his car, across the road, and disappears up a dirt road in a cloud of dust.
 Intrigued, the guy follows the cloud of dust until he comes to a farmer standing by a fence.
 “Say, friend,” he says to the farmer. “I just saw the dangdest thing. A three- legged chicken was running faster than my car.”
 “Yep, that’s one of our chickens,” the farmer says. “We bred ‘em specially.”
 “Why?” The guy asks.
 “Well,” the farmer explains. “When your wife cooks chicken, do you want a drumstick?”
 “Sure.” the guy replies.
 “And your wife wants a drumstick, too, doesn’t she?” The farmer asks.
 “Sure does,” the man replies.
 “And if your boss comes over for dinner,” the farmer says. “He’ll probably want a drumstick, too, won’t he?”
 “I guess so,” the guy replies.
 “That’s why we bred the three-legged chickens,” The farmer says with a proud smile.
 “That’s great,” the guy says. “But how do they taste?”
 “Don’t know,” the farmer replies. “We’ve never caught one.”
 The preceding is neither allegory nor metaphor. I just figured you needed a good laugh, and that’s the funniest clean joke I know. (I know a poem about a guy from Nantucket and a real funny story about a guy who loses his keys, but like I said, that was the funniest clean joke I know.)
 But wait a minute, I might know another clean joke…
 As many of you know, my day job is at a pharmacy, and pharmacies are now what I like to call, “ground zero,” places. These places include (obviously) hospitals, doctors offices and primary care facilities but it also includes grocery stores, pharmacies and even gas stations. (You still need gas to get around, don’t you? )
 I say these places are “ground zero” because they have to keep working, and as such, are mightily exposed to COVID-19. (I have a feeling we’re going to come to hate that hyphenate.) And because of those obvious risks, they have to employ some out-of-the-ordinary measures to protect themselves and you. This is where “social distancing,” comes into play.
 In our store, we’ve placed tape lines in front of our checkstands and pharmacy counters at six foot intervals. (The CDC recommends we maintain a six foot distance in public.) This is done to protect us from you, you from us, and you from each other.
 (Is there a joke in our future, Craig?)
 Well, the other day, a customer got very angry and stormed out after I admonished her to step back behind the tape line.
 Yeah, that’s the punch line.
 OK, so it wasn’t funny, “ha-ha” as much as it was, “isn’t it funny how people react to stuff?”
 Point is, the world up and changed on us in the blink of an eye, and we’re gonna have to learn to deal with that. But remember, it’ll be whole lot easier if we all simply try to employ patience.
 And now that I’ve brought you down, this guy with a chicken on his head walks into a bar, carrying a case of toilet paper…

While Donald Trump’s criminally negligent handling of the crisis - including dismantling and defunding key pandemic-fighting institutions - helped open the floodgates to the spread of coronavirus in the U.S., the reason why it is so frightening is because of the massive inequality reflected in all aspects of society including health, politics and economics. It is also specifically due to the massive cuts to social services, including health provision, that have occurred at the local level under both Republicans and Democrats.

The Centre on Sunday asked state governments and Union Territory administrations to effectively seal state and district borders to stop movement of migrant workers during the nationwide lockdown and warned that those violating the curb will be sent to 14-day quarantine. During a video conference with chief secretaries and DGPs, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla asked them to ensure that there is no movement of people across cities or on highways as the lockdown continues.
 "There has been movement of migrant workers in some parts of the country. Directions were issued that district and state borders should be effectively sealed," an official statement said. States were directed to ensure that there is no movement of people across cities or on highways and there should be strict implementation of the lockdown.
 Only the movement of goods should be allowed. Those who have violated the lockdown and travelled during the period of lockdown will be subject to minimum 14 days of quarantine in government quarantine facilities, the statement said. District Magistrates and SPs should be made personally responsible for the implementation of these directions, it said.
 The two top central government officials told the chiefs of police and civil administrations of all states to make adequate arrangements for food and shelter for the poor and needy people including migrant labourers be made at the place of their work. The Cabinet secretary and home ministry officials are in constant touch with the State chief secretaries and the DGPs.
 Video conferences were held by the Cabinet Secretary and the Home secretary on Saturday evening as well as Sunday morning with the chief secretaries and the DGPs. "It was noted that, by and large, there has been effective implementation of the lockdown guidelines across all States and UTs. Essential supplies have also been maintained. Situation is being monitored round the clock and necessary measures are being taken as required," the statement said. The central government had on Saturday issued orders for the use of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) funds for this purpose. Sufficient funds are available with states in this head, it said.
 States have been also told to ensure timely payment of wages to labourers at their place of work during the period of lockdown without any cut. House rent should not be demanded from the labourers for this period. Action should be taken against those who are asking labourers or students to vacate the premises, the statement said.
 Detailed instructions on monitoring of such persons during quarantine have been issued to the states. It was impressed upon all the states that three weeks of strict enforcement is essential to contain the spread of coronavirus. This is in the interest of everyone, the statement said. A large number of migrant workers have left their work places in different parts of the country in last few days and walking down to their native places, hundreds of kilometres away facing hardships on the way.
 The migrant workers have no option but to walk as there is no transport available after the announcement of the nationwide lockdown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday in a bid to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Seeing their plight, some state governments have made arrangements for their transport, accommodation and food of late.
