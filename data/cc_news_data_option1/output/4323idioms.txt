Proposto a soli 89,99€ invece dei soliti 129,99€, il JBL Flip 5 è un altoparlante bluetooth dalle piccole dimensioni ma che dispone di una potenza capace di garantire un volume decisamente alto, anche se ascoltato a diverse decine di metri di distanza. Volume che viene accompagnato da una qualità audio che possiamo ritenere quasi in alta definizione, dal momento che qualsiasi genere musicale viene riprodotto nei minimi particolari con la massima chiarezza e senza distorsioni. Sia le frequenze alte che basse coprono quasi tutto lo spettro sonoro e sono proprio quest'ultime che riescono a fare la differenza rispetto a tanti altri modelli simili, offrendo un basso naturale e preciso che non ci si aspetterebbe da un design così compatto.

The idea for the web series did not come out of the blue. Before the pandemic, Portland Stage asked Welden to do a reading of the play as part of the theater's planned focus on Maine playwrights during the bicentennial. The pandemic scuttled the theater's plans to host readings, forcing a shift to the digital idea. At first, there was talk of Welden simply relearning the material and performing the play again so it could be recorded. But she didn't love that idea, and asked, "How do we take something designed for live performance and tweak it and adapt it to a format we wanted to use?"

Mirae Asset Investment Managers India has announced launch of two ETFs based on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) companies for the India’s first ever. The new fund offer of both the funds will open for subscription on Tuesday and close on November 10.
 Mirae Asset ESG Sector Leaders ETF, an open-ended scheme, will track Nifty 100 ESG Sector Leaders Total Return Index while ‘Mirae Asset ESG Sector Leaders Fund of Fund will predominantly invest in Mirae Asset ESG Sector Leaders ETF.
 The new index by NSE comprises true to the label ESG focused portfolio with underlying research by Sustainalytics, one of the leading ESG research provider globally. The index consists of companies which have scored well on the management of ESG factors. The index excludes companies with significant ongoing controversy and hence reduces price risk associated with it.
 ## Outperforms
 Nifty 100 ESG Sector Leader Index has outperformed Nifty 100 and Nifty 50 indices historically with lower price volatility and better return to risk profile. The ESG index has outperformed over 90 per cent of large-cap funds (Regular plan) for an investment horizon of three years.
 Swarup Mohanty, CEO, Mirae Asset Investment Managers India, said companies that integrate the focus on planet, people and profit into its core corporate structure tend to have a positive impact and have competitive advantage over others, which in turn could translate to sustainable profit in the long run.
 Globally, challenges like climate change, issues pertaining to mis governance, labour rights and data privacy have led investors to seek out companies that operate in a sustainable, socially responsible and ethical manner, he said.
 The minimum initial investment in both the schemes will be ₹5,000 and multiples of ₹1 thereafter.

Jose Mourinho has said his free-scoring Tottenham Hotspur side still have a long way to go in match the attacking threat of the celebrated Real Madrid team he guided to La Liga glory.
 Spurs have scored 31 goals in their last nine games in all competitions ahead of Monday's trip to Burnley in the Premier League, with England star Harry Kane and South Korea's Son Heung-min both in fine form this season.
 Yet even that glut is overshadowed by the 121 goals that Real managed when winning La Liga in 2011/12 under the guidance of the much-travelled Mourinho, also a title-winning manager in his native Portugal with Porto, in England with Chelsea and in Italy with Inter Milan.
 At the Bernabeu, Mourinho had the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain to call upon up front in addition to a solid defensive unit.
 But Tottenham, who were last crowned champions of England nearly fifty years ago, have been unusually profligate for a Mourinho team which they demonstrated while letting slip a 3-0 lead in the final 10 minutes of an extraordinary 3-3 draw with London rivals West Ham last week.
 "In Real Madrid, I had amazing, amazing attacking players and we managed to build the team in a certain way," Mourinho said.
 "I have to be honest and say we have lots of good attacking players here but we need to give stability to the team because the team needs stability in the back to feel solid, confident -- to (be able to) have a go," he added with Spurs currently a modest 11th in the Premier League table.
 "So we need to find that balance... Behind, we need to improve in some details -- that's obvious."
 Mourinho was criticised for being overly defensive during his time in charge of Manchester United and in his first season at Spurs.
 But he insisted tactics were conditioned by the players at his disposal, saying: "Depends on the team. They cannot say that about my Real Madrid team that scored 121 goals in the league.
 "If they say that about the way to finish second with Manchester United or last season to try to get a way to finish top six and to be in the Europa League, I think they are right."

Before we can make these changes, however, we need to understand the basis and illusion of the familiar reality in which we are living. The first thing we need to understand is that everything that we think or feel is based on principles of duality, which we have never really understood. Our perspective of duality causes us to view everything in terms of conflictual opposites such as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ or ‘us’ and ‘them’. It is from this familiar perspective of duality that we continually struggle through life. This sense of duality and opposition has caused us to fear that there will never be enough for everyone; from that position we have learned to compete with one another rather than to cooperate. Laarkmaa suggests that we learn to use duality properly, by seeing that opposites are merely different perspectives of a more whole, complete reality which can be blended into a true harmony.

Rory McIlroy is determined to cut out the mistakes before the Masters after setting a new career best in birdies made at the Zozo Championship. McIlroy would become only the sixth player to complete golf&rsquo;s &lsquo;Grand Slam&rsquo; of all four modern majors by winning the rescheduled 2020 Masters at Augusta next month.The four-time major winner from Northern Ireland has failed to recapture his pre-lockdown form since golf resumed in June, but he showed signs of being able to end 2020 on a high with a remarkable 29 birdies over 72 holes at Sherwood Country Club in California.&ldquo;It would have been nice to hole that birdie putt at the last, I would have made 30 birdies for the week,&rdquo; McIlroy, 31, said after finishing tied for 17th at the Zozo Championship, which was won by American Patrick Cantlay.&ldquo;So I made 29, which is more than enough to win golf tournaments, I just need to cut out the mistakes.&rdquo;Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods have won golf&rsquo;s four majors – the Masters, Open, US Open and USA PGA Championships.But McIlroy will once more have that chance to join that elite club when he tees it up at Augusta on November 12, the Masters having been moved from its traditional early-April date because of the coronavirus pandemic.McIlroy knows, though, that the errors that led to eight bogeys and three double-bogeys and saw him finish eight shots off the pace at the Zozo Championship must be removed from his game.&ldquo;Just limiting the mistakes more than anything else,&rdquo; McIlroy told Sky Sports when asked what he will be working on ahead of the Masters.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything technical, but yeah, mostly just I&rsquo;ve sort of compounded errors this week a little bit, and last week as well.&ldquo;I had a really bad run there at the end of the tournament to go from wherever I was in the top 10 to outside the top 20. So yeah, it&rsquo;s basically that, when I get out of position.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be really almost just too perfect and I&rsquo;m maybe just being a touch aggressive when I get myself out of position.&ldquo;So just taking my medicine a little bit more when I do. That was sort of the story of the week.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played tournaments where I feel like all I can do is make pars, which is not a bad thing.&ldquo;But at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going to give you chances to win tournaments.&rdquo;

Surging virus cases and politics dominate the agendaA glance at the economic calendar and it looks like a ho-hum day on the surface. The Dallas & Chicago Fed surveys are not market movers and new home sales is barely one rung higher.But it's not a normal time. We're now 8 days from the US election and politics is at an absolute fever pitch. If either campaign has any kind of 'October surprise' left, it's time to spring it. In Congress, Amy Comey Barrett will be confirmed to the Supreme Court today and stimulus talks continue. I think the market must have concluded by now that no deal is coming and is also highly unlikely in the lame duck session. The big story though is the resurgence of the virus to records in much of the US and Europe.

They were 3-0 up by the break and went on to clinch a 4-1 success, their first away from home in the Isthmian League Premier Division. It ended a run of three games without a win and lifts them up to 14th in the table. Conditions were difficult with a blustery wind and driving rain but it was plain sailing for the Scholars in the opening 45 minutes. They had Merstham on the back foot from the opening minutes, Ben Ward-Cochrane twice going close, the latter saved by Tyla Dickinson. It didn't take long for them to press home their advantage either and after robbing the Moatsiders of possession, Nana Kyei's run into the box was halted by Dickinson. Ken Charles did the honours from 12 yards. The next two goals came in a group but not until the final stages of the first half. Joe Payne got the second with his first for the club, a superb free-kick clipped up and over the wall, and after more defensive gifts Kyei won another penalty, the foul this time coming from Elliott Bolton. Kyei took over the kicking duties, slotting home for a 3-0 lead at the break. The home side finally showed their attacking intent in the second period and pulled one back instantly, the ball trickling over the line with Yannick Monga getting the final touch. And they had chances to get a second, Fred Burbidge making a save at his near post to deny Calvin Epkiteta and Monga firing wide from a good position. The Scholars keeper also made a superb stop to deny Monga again and then Calum Davies. But with eight minutes left Potters Bar made sure of the win once and for all, breaking away to net his second of the game and third of the season. They host league leaders Worthing at the LA Construction Stadium tomorrow night (Tuesday) in a 7.45pm kick-off.

India ranks among the world's top 10 countries when it comes to valuing its teaching workforce, according to a new 35-country global survey-based report.
 'Reading Between The Lines: What The World Really Thinks of Teachers', released by the UK-based Varkey Foundation last week, found that India was sixth when it comes to people's implicit, unconscious and automatic views on the status of teachers in the country. The Implicit Teacher Status analysis, which finds China, Ghana, Singapore, Canada and Malaysia ahead of India, ranks countries by respondents' automatic impressions of teachers when asked to indicate as quickly as possible whether, for example, they think teachers are trusted or untrusted, inspiring or uninspiring, caring or uncaring, intelligent or unintelligent, among other word associations. "This report proves that respecting teachers isn't only an important moral duty - it's essential for a country's educational outcomes," said Sunny Varkey, Founder of the Varkey Foundation and the Global Teacher Prize.
 "Since the coronavirus pandemic first emerged, we have seen 1.5 billion learners across the world impacted by school and university closures. In these unprecedented times, now more than ever it is necessary to do all we can to ensure young people throughout the world have access to a good teacher," he said.
 The report, which builds on the data gathered by the Global Teacher Status Index (GTSI) 2018 - a 35-country survey conducted from 1,000 representative respondents in each of the countries - confirms the link between teacher status and pupil attainment. The new report seeks to explain for the first time why "Implicit Teacher Status" varies between countries. It finds that teachers generally enjoy higher status in richer countries, and in countries which allot a greater fraction of public funds to education. For instance, India's expenditure on education as a percentage of government spending is 14 per cent. In Italy, which ranks 24th for Implicit Teacher Status, by comparison, it is only 8.1 per cent, whereas in Ghana, which ranks second, it is 22.1 per cent.
 The report coincides with the announcement of the finalists for the 2020 Global Teacher Prize, which includes Ranjitsinh Disale - a teacher from a village in Maharashtra who is in the running for the USD 1-million annual prize, to be unveiled later this year.
 "We created the Global Teacher Prize, which shines a light on the extraordinary work that teachers do around the world, to inspire people to talk about the great work of teachers. We have seen teachers go above and beyond to keep young people learning all over the world amid the Covid pandemic," added Varkey.
 As part of the new report's analysis, Professor Peter Dolton of the University of Sussex and Doctor Robert De Vries of the University of Kent reassessed the GTSI data to find a remarkably strong positive correlation between Implicit Teacher Status and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results. PISA scores are significantly higher in countries where people implicitly view teachers more positively.

Second-half goals from substitute Jordan Maguire-Drew and Conor Wilkinson sealed the three points for the O's at the Lamex Stadium and made it back-to-back wins in League Two. The boss insists this is more the standards he expects from his squad. "What a difference a week makes, we had some panicky phone calls and text messages last week, and we have to put things into perspective so by no means today (Saturday) are we the finished article," Embleton said. "We're not going to get promoted on the back of two comfortable wins, but like I say for me last weeks by no means was it panic stations, our club has been through a lot and we have to recognise that. "I feel I can now see the freshness, the attitude, and the Leyton Orient team that I would like to see out on the pitch performing which we've done in the last two games especially in the second-half." The former Swindon Town assistant manager heaped praise on the attitude of attacking midfielder Maguire-Drew after being dropped for the match yet coming on to create a real impact. "Jordan rightly so should be disappointed that he didn't start the game, but we have to remember at the same time that Conor Wilkinson has had a very good season as well. "My conversation with Jordan wasn't to explain to him why he wasn't playing, it was more to explain to him the reason why Conor was starting in his place. "Jordan and I have a very good understanding, when we have a conversation and he knows he's performing well, then his reaction is always when I come on then I'm going to be ready and he was in abundance and I love that about Jordan." The boss also praised goalkeeper Lawrence Vigoroux and believes he has been terrific all season. "We know how important he has been to us, my thing for Lawrence was I don't think we'd given him enough clean sheets or statistics to support the performances that he has been putting in, but we have done today (Saturday) and Tuesday night."

Shimla To revive economic activity in the state, the Himachal Pradesh government has borrowed ₹1,000 crore to pay salaries of its employees and expedite development projects that have been hit by the lockdown imposed due to the covid-19 pandemic. The loan has been taken from the Reserve Bank of India. The state has estimated a revenue loss of ₹32,000 crore over the past seven months due to the pandemic. The government has issued a notification to raise the loan.Tourism, transport, horticulture, and other related businesses have been severely hit, with the segment incurring losses of Rs 20,000 crore. With the sector contributing around 7% to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), the damage needs to be undone. Last fiscal, around 1.7 crore tourists visited the state; this fiscal, the number has dropped to a trickle at a mere 80,000 to date. If one compares it to the built-up capacity in the sector, the gravity of the situation is visible. There are 3,679 hotels with 1.03 lakh beds in the state; the tourism department has another 12,000-odd beds. The first tranche of loan of Rs 500 crore will be deposited in government treasury on October 28, with April 2029 the deadline to repay. The second loan of ₹500 crore must be repaid by April 2030.The state government raised a loan of ₹1,120 crore in April and ₹800 crore in July this year. Overall, the state has a debt of ₹57,620 crore, even as the overall budget layout was ₹ 49,131 crore. The government had targeted 11% increase in revenue receipt this year, but covid-19 put paid to all such hopes. With 30% of the state's budget spent on salaries and pensions to employees, new development and capital expenditure takes a hit.An analysis of expenditure shows that the state government will be spending ₹13,099 crore on salaries, ₹7,266 crore on pension and ₹4,931 crore on repayment of loans and interest this fiscal.The State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP), which is pegged at 1.65 lakh crore, has dipped 17% after lock- down. The CM had formed a committee to suggest measures to revive the economy. "We need to look at this epidemic differently. Steps are being taken for diversification in agriculture to encourage farmers to cultivate off-seasonal vegetables, creating better marketing for farm produce etc. Better infrastructure will be created to woo investors." said CM Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the finance portfolio.The state government has taken short-term steps such as cut in salaries of the CM, speaker, ministers and MLAs. "The MLA development fund had to be suspended for some time," Thakur said. The opposition Congress has been repeatedly targeting the state government over its poor fiscal health, and accuses it of fiscal mismanagement.

George Jijiashvili, a senior analyst at consultancy firm Omdia suggested Facebook wanted to take its gaming approach slowly.
 "After mixed reviews for Google Stadia, it's clear Facebook wants to avoid the same missteps and is proceeding cautiously with its own cloud gaming strategy," he said. "These aren't new games that will turn heads, but the line-up does fit in with their 'one-step at a time' approach."
 Facebook is describing the limited rollout as a beta and says it will ramp up availability over the next few months.
 The games will initially be available to users across California, Texas and Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states such as Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut, before expanding through the rest of the country.

Rajalakshmi Nirmal
 With metal prices shooting through the roof, Harssha Shetty, Director- Marketing, International Business, Vedanta Group, in an interview with _BusinessLine,_ explains fundamentals of the metals market in India and globally. Excerpts:
 How do you see the global base metals markets at present? How’s demand-supply playing out?
 Currently, there are a few broad themes which are playing out in the market in the commodities space. One is the US elections and the stimulus expectations. If Joe Biden wins, a predictable policy environment and shift from ‘trade protectionism’ to ‘trade promotion’ policies would be good for commodities. The $2-trillion war chest which Biden has planned for infrastructure and clean energy will also be positive for non-ferrous metals. The second theme, is the second wave of Covid-19, which is impacting the demand. Although we see a V-shaped recovery in a few economies, we should remember that what goes up comes down and what goes down comes up.
 So, while there is a clear recovery in India, many segments of demand need to be back to pre-Covid levels and for some time people will spend on the ‘needs rather than wants’. Hence, while there is a good consumer spending in the West, here it is not consumer spending led recovery, it is government spending led recovery… China has recovered, no doubt. Most of their economic indicators are positive, but the Rest of the World (ex-China) will need to be back on track next quarter for a sustained global recovery. This is the right time for our government to protect the domestic industry against imports from China and review our FTAs.
 Demand for metals led by China is strong globally, but how’s the Indian picture?
 In India, the IIP has sharply recovered to positive territory and the PMI is very strong at 56.8. This bodes well. The count of tenders announced by Central and State governments has increased by 300 per cent over April 2020. The government’s Housing for All and the electrical infra projects will pump up non-ferrous metal demand in the next two quarters. The demand for long steel products is actually better than what it was during pre-Covid. This signals nothing but a very strong infrastructure demand. On the consumer side, when we speak to the battery manufacturers or automobile customers what we see is the demand for the alloy called A356.2 in aluminium which goes into making of alloy wheels for which we are the only producer in the country, the kind of demand which is coming is more than we had ever imagined. And the reason seems to be the automobile makers expecting two-wheeler sales in a big way as they find more people wanting to have their own private mobility because of the fear of Covid. So, all in all, we expect consumption this quarter in non- ferrous metals to be at least 20-25 per cent better than last quarter (September 2020 quarter). Q4 of this financial year is likely to be at the same level or slightly better than last year Q4. H2 will definitely show a 5-7 per cent growth over H2 of FY20.
 Which are the metals that are witnessing a strong demand and which are the sectors fuelling the demand?
 Among non-ferrous metals, aluminium consumption is very strong now. Copper and zinc have recovered fast. The buying is from infrastructure players (largely due to government spending in electrical transmission towers, low cost housing projects) and automobile manufacturers.
 Copper prices have hit a peak of $7,000/tonne in LME. Do you think there is more room for prices to go up?
 In the short term, that is 3-6 months, there is a strong support driven by Chinese demand and the supply tightness in copper. If Joe Biden wins, the $2-trillion stimulus will also help is the medium to long term.
 For India, how you think this year will end compared to FY20?
 FY21 will end on a crescendo. A lot of latent demand will be fulfilled in the next five months. There will be only a five per cent contraction in demand for aluminium, thanks to the strong recovery in last two months.
 In copper, zinc and lead, it may be to the tune of 7-9 per cent mainly because of the Q1 contraction. FY22 depends on the geopolitical canvas post the US elections. It also depends on how anti-China trade sentiment pans out. Europe has already slapped an anti-dumping duty on imports from China. And, even if Biden comes to power, he may not soften the stance on China.
 That said, the India picture is good with strong demand from infrastructure players. The MSME incentives which the government has announced, will help. The world will cosy up to India for being a compelling alternative to China thus opening up more domestic demand. And, since we are a country under construction, future is good for metal players.

To revive economic activity in the state, the Himachal Pradesh government has borrowed ₹1,000 crore to pay salaries of its employees and expedite development projects that have been hit by the lockdown imposed due to the covid-19 pandemic. The loan has been taken from the Reserve Bank of India.
 The state has estimated a revenue loss of ₹32,000 crore over the past seven months due to the pandemic. The government has issued a notification to raise the loan.
 Tourism, transport, horticulture, and other related businesses have been severely hit, with the segment incurring losses of Rs 20,000 crore. With the sector contributing around 7% to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), the damage needs to be undone.
 Last fiscal, around 1.7 crore tourists visited the state; this fiscal, the number has dropped to a trickle at a mere 80,000 to date. If one compares it to the built-up capacity in the sector, the gravity of the situation is visible. There are 3,679 hotels with 1.03 lakh beds in the state; the tourism department has another 12,000-odd beds.
   
   
 The first tranche of loan of Rs 500 crore will be deposited in government treasury on October 28, with April 2029 the deadline to repay. The second loan of ₹500 crore must be repaid by April 2030.
 The state government raised a loan of ₹1,120 crore in April and ₹800 crore in July this year. Overall, the state has a debt of ₹57,620 crore, even as the overall budget layout was ₹ 49,131 crore. The government had targeted 11% increase in revenue receipt this year, but covid-19 put paid to all such hopes. With 30% of the state's budget spent on salaries and pensions to employees, new development and capital expenditure takes a hit.
 An analysis of expenditure shows that the state government will be spending ₹13,099 crore on salaries, ₹7,266 crore on pension and ₹4,931 crore on repayment of loans and interest this fiscal.
 The State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP), which is pegged at 1.65 lakh crore, has dipped 17% after lock-down. The CM had formed a committee to suggest measures to revive the economy. "We need to look at this epidemic differently. Steps are being taken for diversification in agriculture to encourage farmers to cultivate off-seasonal vegetables, creating better marketing for farm produce etc. Better infrastructure will be created to woo investors." said CM Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the finance portfolio.
 The state government has taken short-term steps such as cut in salaries of the CM, speaker, ministers and MLAs. "The MLA development fund had to be suspended for some time," Thakur said. The opposition Congress has been repeatedly targeting the state government over its poor fiscal health, and accuses it of fiscal mismanagement.

Part of the issue which saw Haaland move to Dortmund was that United had no interest including a release clause into any deal for the 20-year-old. The German club didn't mind however, with the striker believed to possess a £68m release clause which can be triggered in the summer of 2022.
 In the meantime United moved to sign Odion Ighalo and now Edinson Cavani as short-term fixes and they could also hold the key behind any potential move for Haaland in the future.
 Signed on an initial one-year deal Cavani looks like a wise temporary boost to the club's attacking line, albeit at the expense of the ongoing cultural reset, with United able to trigger a second-year if they so wish next summer. It means that if a deal for Haaland is on the cards in a year's time they can bid farewell to the Uruguayan at no great expense, while there is still the option to extend it if the 2022 release clause proves to be a more viable option.

 Murphy has had to wait patiently for a start in the Premier League - 690 days to be exact - but it would not be an exaggeration to say that his display against Wolves was among his best in the top-flight for Newcastle as Krafth and Manquillo watched on from the bench.
 Even before he stepped up to score that late equaliser, Murphy had caught the eye, whether it was a teasing ball over the top into the channel for Callum Wilson to run on to or a dogged piece of defending to win the ball back from Podence.
 According to Wyscout, a tool Newcastle's analysts use, 80% of Murphy's dribbles were successful while 73% of his passes were accurate on Sunday. Defensively, Murphy won 10 duels and made six interceptions, five recoveries and four clearances.

Later that week, the Chelsea team traveled to Dexter’s twin turf field for the final game of the season. When the teams matched up earlier in the season, Dexter prevailed 3-0. The Bulldogs were determined to have a stronger showing, especially since this would be the last middle school game for eighth graders Ava-Reese Hagen, Abbie Nye, Teresa Smith, Keygan Monahan, Slater Boos, Lindsey Partyka, and Naomi Ratliff. During the first quarter, the Bulldogs’ defensive line was put to the test defending four penalty corners, successfully keeping the ball out of the goal. The Dreadnaughts kept up the pressure during the second quarter, breaking through to score one goal. During the first half, skilled stickwork in the midfield by B. Taylor, Partyka, A. Eckert, and Boos helped the team transition the ball down the field, and Smith as center forward attempted to convert a breakaway opportunity to a goal. In the third quarter, Hagen’s strategic pass to Smith created another breakaway opportunity culminating with Smith lifting the ball past the Dexter goalie and into the net, tying the score 1-1. Efforts in the midfield and offensive lines by McCollum, Brinna Wenzel, Boos, and Monahan also opened the field of play for the team. Despite the constant pressure on Chelsea’s entire defensive line throughout the game, and especially in the fourth quarter defending against five penalty quarters, the determined Bulldogs allowed only one goal the entire game thanks in large part to the effective combination of Ratliff, who had a tremendous game as goalie, paired with Hagen as sweeper; big hits and proficient stickwork by L. Taylor, Monahan, and Nye also proved to be key components of Chelsea’s success in the defensive end. Hagan, who had missed several games because of an injury, played a crucial role in the successful outcome of the game for the Bulldogs against a skilled and fast Dexter team.

They were 3-0 up by the break and went on to clinch a 4-1 success, their first away from home in the Isthmian League Premier Division.
 It ended a run of three games without a win and lifts them up to 14th in the table.
 Conditions were difficult with a blustery wind and driving rain but it was plain sailing for the Scholars in the opening 45 minutes.
 They had Merstham on the back foot from the opening minutes, Ben Ward-Cochrane twice going close, the latter saved by Tyla Dickinson.
 It didn’t take long for them to press home their advantage either and after robbing the Moatsiders of possession, Nana Kyei’s run into the box was halted by Dickinson.
 Ken Charles did the honours from 12 yards.
 The next two goals came in a group but not until the final stages of the first half.
 Joe Payne got the second with his first for the club, a superb free-kick clipped up and over the wall, and after more defensive gifts Kyei won another penalty, the foul this time coming from Elliott Bolton.
 Kyei took over the kicking duties, slotting home for a 3-0 lead at the break.
 The home side finally showed their attacking intent in the second period and pulled one back instantly, the ball trickling over the line with Yannick Monga getting the final touch.
 And they had chances to get a second, Fred Burbidge making a save at his near post to deny Calvin Epkiteta and Monga firing wide from a good position.
 The Scholars keeper also made a superb stop to deny Monga again and then Calum Davies.
 But with eight minutes left Potters Bar made sure of the win once and for all, breaking away to net his second of the game and third of the season.
 They host league leaders Worthing at the LA Construction Stadium tomorrow night (Tuesday) in a 7.45pm kick-off.

These goggles have photochromic lenses, which means they automatically get darker when ambient light increases, and then get lighter when the clouds come out. It’s true that Julbo isn’t the first to have those, by a long shot. What makes these special is the unique venting design. The lens itself pops forward a bit, leaving a gap between the lens and your face where air can flow freely. Why would you want this? Because when your face starts overheating your goggles are going to fog up, and then you can’t see. This gives the lens (and your face) space to breathe.

Sanders says some people need more training than others, but if scorers repeatedly fall short of the company's performance guidelines, they're fired. Since April, this scoring center has let 51 scorers go. They've not been hard to replace, though. Pay isn't bad — $12 to $15 an hour if you include bonuses. People without a four-year college degree need not apply.
