Iceland, in 1984, became one of the first European nations to ban discarding fish waste at sea. (The European Union didn’t follow suit until 2015.) The ban first started with the cod fishery, reducing by-catch of undersized cod to boost declining stocks, and has since expanded to most other species. Icelandic fishers have adopted special mesh nets that allow small fish to escape. Inspections and surveillance have further shrunk the amount of discards.

In view of this the Minister needs to come clean on this matter by providing bank statements confirming what he actually claims to be a true statement of fact. This should be in addition to an audited financial statement which will clearly state what has actually obtained.

The Minister has to tread carefully on this score. He must come clean with convincing arguments supported with irrefutably clear evidence accounting for the huge variance shown on the books so far.

That means the tablet won't work on Verizon's small but ultra-fast 5G network, though Samsung might create another variant for the carrier if it deems that feasible. The chipset is supported by either 6 or 8GB of RAM, depending on whether you choose 128 or 256GB of storage. On the software side, the tablet will come with OneUI 2.5 and Android 10.

It’s About Time is filled with the kind of riffs that will rouse live audiences and like all good blues-rock collections, it’s groovy and funky and in this case, occasionally electronic.

The decision was made in light of the high and increasing levels of COVID-19 infections in major overseas markets, recent events in Victoria, and the present uncertainty about the nature and level of government economic stimulus in Australia after September 2020. The new date takes account of ASIC's extension of the deadline for listed companies to lodge their audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2020 until 31 October 2020. It gives companies a further month to complete a capital raising, if they decide they need one, after publishing their audited accounts by the revised deadline.

As an additional question mark, I would take the job creation claim—5,500 permanent jobs and 18,000 construction jobs—with a grain of salt. That’s because the report lacks information on how developers came up with those numbers, so there’s no way of knowing to what extent the figures are arbitrarily derived. Developers pushing a pro-jobs message on the ballot have an inherent incentive to present the highest-possible employment figures to the public. The same goes for economic figures such as the claim it would create $2.3 billion in construction activity. We should be asking these questions—not just trusting the developer at face value.

The mechanical breakdown is only the latest problem to plague not only the Polaris fleet but also plans to rotate the current contingent of Canadian troops in Latvia.


  A Polaris carrying about 70 Canadian soldiers to Latvia was forced to turn around last week because of concerns those on board might have been exposed to COVID-19.


  All military personnel deploying on overseas missions are required to undergo strict quarantine measures to ensure troops do not carry COVID-19 to another country or spread the respiratory illness among their unit.


  Despite those precautions, the plane was forced to turn around in midair after the military received word that a civilian contractor at CFB Trenton who may have come in contact with the plane and passengers had tested positive for the illness.


  Those who were on board are now in the middle of a second 14-day isolation period.


  The NATO battlegroup in Latvia includes troops from eight other countries. It and similar battlegroups in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland were created after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and began to support separatist forces in Ukraine’s eastern regions.


  The battlegroups are designed to defend against a Russian invasion, but their small size means they would almost certainly be overwhelmed in a real war. Instead, their main utility is to deter Russian aggression, with the idea that an attack on one would draw in all of NATO.


  This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 10, 2020.

  A man's medication for alcohol dependence caused him to have a strange reaction to hand sanitizer, according to a new report of the case.


  The 43-year-old man was visiting his bank when he began experiencing what looked like an allergic reaction -- he suddenly became flushed, nauseated and uneasy. His symptoms started after he had applied hand sanitizer to his hands when he arrived at the bank, to follow the rules that were in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the report, published in the July issue of the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism.


  The man was rushed to the emergency room, where he was found to have a fast heartbeat, or tachycardia, along with redness on his chest and face.


  For three years, the man had been taking disulfiram, a medication to treat alcohol abuse that causes hangover-like effects -- including flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting and fast heart rate -- almost immediately after consuming alcohol. The drug causes these unpleasant side effects, which typically last about an hour,  to deter people from drinking; and the man said he had abstained from alcohol for three years.


  Disulfiram works by blocking the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which helps rid the body of acetaldehyde, a breakdown product of alcohol that plays a role in causing the symptoms of a hangover. Thus, taking disulfiram leads to a buildup of acetaldehyde if people are exposed to alcohol. The drug has been approved for more than 50 years to treat alcohol dependence, and about 200,000 people in the U.S. regularly take the drug, according to Medscape.


  Because exposure to even small amounts of alcohol can trigger a reaction, people taking disulfiram are warned not to use alcohol-containing products, such as some sauces, vinegars, cough syrups and mouthwashes; and to avoid breathing in fumes that may contain alcohol, such as from paint thinner or varnish, according to the Mayo Clinic. Hand sanitizers typically contain 60% to 70% alcohol, and should also be avoided, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.


  In the man's case, doctors suspected a reaction to alcohol due to disulfiram, and he was treated with an antihistamine along with an injectable form of vitamin C, which are some of the recommended supportive treatments for a disulfiram-alcohol reaction, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.


  The man's symptoms resolved after an hour, and he was released from the hospital but warned to either not use sanitizer or to stop using disulfiram, the report said. Sole author of the report, Dr. Avinash De Sousa, of Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College in Mumbai, India, is the patient's psychiatrist, and after a consultation, "it was decided that because sanitizer use would be rampant, [the man] would cease disulfiram for the time being," De Sousa wrote.


  A recent study, also published the July issue of Alcohol and Alcoholism, suggested that inhalation of the alcohol fumes from hand sanitizer, rather than absorption of alcohol through the skin, appears to be the main way that the alcohol in hand sanitizers reaches the bloodstream.

 Her son, 4, was found asleep on board. He told police they went swimming but his mother never returned.
 Search teams are hunting for her body but conditions are difficult.
 Rivera is best known for playing cheerleader Santana Lopez in Glee, the hugely popular musical comedy TV series that ran on the Fox network from 2009 to 2015.

It’s been a busy few weeks in terms of album and EP releases. Among the records I’ve been streaming are synth-pop producer Dreamhour’s _POPSTVR_ and rapper Naezy’s _2014_, who do what they do best on their respective sophomore efforts. The set I’ve chosen to highlight is a debut offering. The Dirt Machine is the new project from folk-fusion rock band Advaita’s bassist Gaurav Chintamani and it’s a welcome addition to the handful of blues-rock acts we have in the country. _It’s About Time_ is filled with the kind of riffs that will rouse live audiences and like all good blues-rock collections, it’s groovy and funky and in this case, occasionally electronic. After you’ve listened to it, lend your ears also to “ _Hold The Line_ ”, the impressive single by Plan B aka the synth-pop avatar of Chintamani’s Advaita bandmate, guitarist Abhishek Mathur.

  The album’s cover design and graphics are the handiwork of bass player Mueck and it’s “an actual picture that has been doctored a bit,” Grant said.


  The figure clad in a old deep sea dive suit is a sculpture created by local artist Kevin Mahoney, Grant said.


  “Fishbowl” really is a collective project, from its appearance to the music, which the band writes together. One band member may start with an idea for a song, but it isn’t complete until every band member puts their touches on it, Grant said.

Andy Samberg becomes the latest "Saturday Night Live" alum to explore movie stardom with "Palm Springs," a romantic comedy co-starring Cristin Milioti. If that career arc sounds familiar, so does most everything about this breezy "Groundhog Day"-esque premise, which casts Samberg as a guy repeating the same day over and over.


  Premiering on Hulu, after commanding what was reportedly a record sale at the Sundance Film Festival, the movie isn't bad. Yet even with the clever tweaks introduced by its sci-fi-flavored premise -- referencing "infinite time-loop situations," giving it more context than the 1993 Bill Murray vehicle possessed -- the film turns out to be a fun but thin construct, fostering a sense of itchiness to see how and if it's going to pay off.


  Granted, there's nothing completely new under the sun -- in this case, the hot desert sun -- and there have been plenty of variations on this formula, including the Netflix series "Russian Doll." Yet even making those allowances, this feels derivative almost to the point of distraction. And while its try- and-try-again exchanges can be pretty funny, the film feels as if it's laboring to flesh out even the under-90-minute running time.

LITTLE ROCK -- Little Rock became the first city in Arkansas to pass a measure with increased penalties specifically for hate crimes that target people based on their race, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.


   


  The city's Board of Directors on Tuesday approved the ordinance that would enforce up to $1,000 in fines for a first offense, depending on the violation. In addition, the penalty includes a sentence of 30 days, 90 days or a year in jail or a combination of fine and imprisonment.


   


  Arkansas is one of only four states without a specific hate crimes law, declining over the years to follow the national legal trend for combatting violence incited by prejudice, discrimination or racism. The other three states that lack hate crime laws are Georgia, South Carolina, Wyoming and Indiana.


   


  Little Rock's new measure states that enhanced penalties for crimes that target people's race, religion or sexual orientation are a way for society to recognize that those offenses "strike special fear within victimized groups, fragment communities, and tear at the very fabric of our democratic way of life."


   


  Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. said other cities can follow in his city's footsteps, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported Wednesday.


   


  "It's my belief that this (ordinance) will serve as model legislation," Scott said.


   


  Little Rock Ward 3 City Director Kathy Webb worked with attorneys from the Anti-Defamation League for more than a year to create the legislation. Webb said the ordinance requires Little Rock police to report hate crimes to the FBI.


   


  Aaron Ahlquist, ADL's south-central regional director, said the measure's approval sends a clear message to the Arkansas Legislature that the state should adopt hate crimes laws.


   


  "And we urge other Arkansas communities to amplify this message by providing hate crime protections to their residents," Ahlquist said in a statement Tuesday.


   


  Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of Arkansas lawmakers released last month a draft of a bill that addresses hate crimes by enhancing penalties for targeted offenses in the state. The bill is expected to be discussed in the Legislature during the January session.


   


  Last year, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Arkansas should have harsher penalties for those who commit crimes targeting people because of their race, ethnicity or religion.

On any summer day, in the middle of the state's largest cherry orchard belt, folks in Traverse City, Michigan, are busy enjoying its natural splendor -- swimming, sailing, hiking or relaxing in Adirondack chairs by the beach. And its cultural and culinary vitality make it worth more than just a pit stop.      About 250 miles northwest of Detroit and scattered among rolling farmland and hardwood forests, Traverse City has dozens of lakes and waterways, historic lighthouses, and ships and boats that travel its bay and inlets. Best of all, it has Lake Michigan in its backyard -- including the bucolic Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, where sand dunes tower up to 400 feet above turquoise-colored water.      "If you want to get away, get out in nature and spread out, this is the perfect place to do it," said Jillian Manning, public relations manager for Traverse City Tourism.      Traverse City also has become known for the quality of its wines (it has more than 40 wineries in the area) and craft breweries and is getting national attention for its imaginative local cuisine.      The town has much to offer in the way of museums, theaters, shops and galleries and is home to The Dennos Museum Center, which has the largest collection of Inuit art in the country.      Its climate has made it an ideal place to grow all types of cherries, but it's one of the leading producers of tart cherries in the United States, Manning said.      And cherries aren't the only crop this fruit-forward place is famous for growing. Because of its location along the 45th parallel, which is halfway between the North Pole and Equator, the region is ideal for growing grapes. It's at the same longitude of the great grape-growing regions of Spain and France, Manning said.      Traverse's agricultural bounty has made it into a rich culinary destination, with restaurants ranging from French to Vietnamese to farm-to-table to taco stands. This summer, Manning said, outdoor dining will be expanded to a two- block downtown area on Front Street (between Park and Union streets). The area will be closed to traffic and additional outdoor seating has been added so diners can properly practice social distancing.      Two downtown architectural and historical gems are the State Theatre and the City Opera House. The State, built in the early 1900s, was the first in Traverse City to offer a "talkie film" and features the annual Traverse City Film Festival, hosted by filmmaker Michael Moore. This year it was canceled because of COVID-19.      The 1891 Victorian, brick opera house -- one of 50 opera houses built in Michigan in the 19th century -- is one of a handful that are still standing. It was closed in 1920 but fully restored in 2005 and hosts concerts, dance performances and appearances by noted writers.      The Grand Traverse Commons -- a complex of galleries, shops, restaurants and residential areas housed in pale yellow, Victorian-Italianate buildings built in 1885 -- is surrounded by meadows and forests and was once a state mental hospital.

The Cross Sport lowers the Atlas' roofline to 67.8 inches (down 2.3) and shortens the SUV's overall length to 195.5 inches (5.2 less). The result, along with a bit of a nipping and tucking of the profile, is a much more muscular and athletic take on the standard Atlas' stiff, brick-like aesthetic.


  The slightly shorter length visually pushes the rear wheels out to the vehicle's corners, giving the Cross Sport a more aggressive-looking stance, while the lower roofline and exaggerated wheel arches make the Atlas appear lower and leaner. Personally, I think the Cross Sport looks the way the Atlas should have all along.

LUCKNOW, India July 10 (Reuters) - Indian police shot dead on Friday a man who had been accused of ordering the killing of eight policemen when he tried to flee from officers who had taken him into custody after he surrendered, officials said.                                                                         Vikas Dubey, who was on the run for over a week after he allegedly ordered the eight policemen killed, was shot dead in northern state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) after an accident as he was being taken to detention.                                                                         "We were bringing Dubey to the prison when a car he was in overturned ... we had to shoot him because he stole a policeman's gun and tried to flee," said a senior police official in the state capital of Lucknow.                                                                         Dubey had been accused in 60 criminal cases, of various offences including attempted murder, and talk of his links with police and politicians has been dominating headlines ever since the shootout last week in which the eight police were killed and seven wounded.                                                                         Two of Dubey's aides were killed in last week's violence and a police officer posted near Dubey's village was arrested over allegations that he helped him flee.

Investment in US offshore wind projects are set to hit $78 billion (€69 billion) this decade, in contrast with an estimated $82 billion for US offshore oil and gasoline projects, Wood Mackenzie data shows. This would be a remarkable feat only four years after the first offshore wind plant — the 30 megawatt (MW) Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island — started operating in US waters.


  According to the Department of Energy (DOE), there are 28 US offshore wind projects in the planning stage, with the biggest clusters along the East Coast, from Massachusetts to Virginia. There are also 15 active commercial leases for offshore wind development in the US and if they are fully built, there is the potential to support approximately 25 GW of offshore wind capacity.


  Wind energy, both onshore and offshore, is now the US's top choice for new power, with 39% of new utility-scale power sector additions at 107 GW — enough to power 32 million homes. It is also the largest renewable energy source in the country, supplying over 7% of the nation's electricity.


  The domestic offshore wind market is smaller than the onshore sector, where capacity is now over 100 GW, but growing. "The shift of investment towards offshore wind in the US is due to a decreasing amount of leasable space on land because an increasing number of landowners and communities are objecting to local siting,” says Annie Hawkins, Executive Director, Responsible Offshore Development Alliance (RODA). "From an environmental perspective, there is a limited amount of space that can reasonably be developed without significant impacts to ocean ecosystems and the existing ocean resource economy," Hawkins adds..


  Europe has long been the global leader in offshore wind generation, with the US focused on developing land-based wind facilities. According to industry body WindEurope, overall offshore capacity for European nations is 22 GW, with 4,000 offshore wind turbines erected in the waters of 11 countries, with a combined power generation capacity of 15.8 GW, enough to supply around 15 mid- size cities.
