The very fact that the State Sector, in this case the NHS, is behind the curve should come as no surprise. They are a State funded body and see no reason to work towards positive outcomes. Private Healthcare has to adapt if it is to survive. This is why I advocate that Private Hospitals should be allowed to compete for patient care. Don't just give the bottonless pit that the NHS has become more money, make it work for it. If a patient needs treatment the patient should be given the choice, via their GP if they wish to go NHS or Private. All the government needs do is write the cheque like it did before.

Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) founder and chairman Erel Margalit reached out to French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of his visit to Lebanon, and extended an offer of aid following the massive explosion at the Beirut Port.
 The explosion, which occurred on Tuesday, saw at least 145 people killed and 5,000 people injured. Among the dead were also French and US citizens.
 Multiple countries stepped up to offer financial aid and disaster relief efforts, with Macron flying to Lebanon personally to assure Lebanese citizens that French aid would go into helping the people, rather than going into "corrupt hands."
 Ahead of his visit, Margalit praised Macron for visiting Lebanon, as well as expressing the importance of humanitarian aid. He then further reiterated Israel's offer of lending aid and disaster relief to the people of Lebanon, pointing out Israel's status as a leader in search and rescue.
 "You know Israel well, and particularly our search and rescue, and medical and technological capabilities. You saw these capabilities first-hand in your various business roles when we worked together, and continue to see them today in your public role as a leader," Margalit told Macron.
 "I am prepared to offer assistance in any way I can - please convey my personal message to the Lebanese leadership, that the neighboring state of Israel stands ready to help during this most difficult time. This is part of our ethos."
 Lebanon had rejected Israel's offer of sending aid and relief, but Margalit hopes Macron can convince them to change their minds.
 "You have the connections, leadership, and ability to break through this barrier," he told the French president.
 "For this reason I am passing our message through you."
 Margalit later added that: "In an official capacity, the state of Israel has already offered Lebanon immediate humanitarian aid to deal with the disaster, but beyond humanitarian aid, we have capabilities as a start-up nation to assist Lebanon in the hi-tech field and in general - notably in there is a tech hub in the Galilee on the Lebanese border, and for digital medicine in Haifa."
 He concluded, "Israel has fought terrorism from Lebanon for decades, but we have nothing against the Lebanese people who are facing such a difficult time. We are ready to lend a hand in the reconstruction and we will be happy to help - whether publicly or quietly."
 Macron said he welcomed the message and promised to pass it on to the Lebanese leadership.
 Lebanon's refusal of Israeli aid coincided with numerous calls both from within Israel and abroad that the offer of aid was merely an attempt to garner positive PR. This is despite Israel's status as a world leader in search and rescue and in disaster relief, with the Jewish state having sent humanitarian aid to disasters across the world for years. This includes older disasters such as the 1953 earthquake that struck Greece's Ionian islands, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the Syrian Civil War.

TV shows can get back up and running during the age of Covid-19. But as Hollywood seeks to adopt new health and safety protocols, production is going to take more time -- and money.
 That was the main takeaway from a Hollywood Radio and Television Society panel Wednesday night, discussing the logistics of production during a pandemic. Participants estimated testing and other precautions are adding roughly 10% to production costs, and cited the need for "Covid-related contingencies" being incorporated into series budgets, said Erika Munro Kennerly, senior vice president and associate general counsel of Endeavor Content.
 "Production is coming back. It's just going to take a little bit longer and cost a little bit more," said Scott Hervey, an entertainment attorney with Weintraub Tobin.

PULASKI -- Martin Methodist College has instituted a test-optional admissions process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 High school seniors who have not taken their ACT or SAT tests are still eligible for admissions to MMC, even if they lack scores for this current application cycle for fall enrollment, Vice President of Enrollment Tyler Cox said.
   
 The Admissions Office will place more emphasis on the overall student through other points of evaluation, like grade point average, prior assessments, extracurricular activities and recommendations.
   
 "We value the whole person more than a single measure like the ACT; high school seniors have had a hard spring semester, and MMC does not want to make it any harder. Thus, we have figured out a way to help these seniors in the college admissions process," Cox said.
   
 Cox added that though the recruitment process may look a little different this summer, MMC is open and happy to host campus tours for students and their families.
   
 "Right now we are hosting in-person tours, as well as virtual visits. For families who come to campus, we ask that they wear masks on their campus tours. They are able to meet with coaches, financial aid, business office representatives, as usual, though we have a modified schedule and some restrictions in place. Of interest to many families, financial aid is still available. And the new graduate program in Criminal Justice is accepting applications currently. In many ways, it's business as usual," Cox said.
   
 According to Dr. Judy Cheatham, Provost, classes and classroom instruction have also been modified based on health and safety recommendations. Students will have the regular face-to-face instruction, but they also may have some classes taught in a hybrid manner (with a class meeting face to face half the time, and the other half taught virtually), or online.
   
 "We pride ourselves on our one-to-one connections on campus--students and faculty, students and coaches, students and campus life. Through months of planning as well as additional training and new technology, we are able to offer several different options for students in classes in the fall," she said. "Classrooms have had extra chairs and desks removed, physical distancing and polycarbonate barriers have been implemented, even restrooms have been modified. However, students will find that tutoring, advising, library services, the MMC clinic, campus life will all be available. And for first year students for whom face-to-face instruction is so important, we are able to provide that while still being flexible enough to support the needs of students who for whatever reason would prefer virtual classes."
   
 Cheatham said as a campus, the whole shift to doing things a little differently will take communication, but that will also provide more opportunities for students to engage with the college community, even if some of that engagement is virtual.
   
 "Ironically," Cheatham continued, "we are launching two new majors this fall-- Public Health Education and Cyber Security. We had no idea about this global pandemic as we conceptualized those two new majors, but graduates of both programs will certainly be in high demand in the workforce because of this situation."
   
 Martin Methodist College, founded in 1870, is a private, liberal arts college affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Martin Methodist offers baccalaureate degrees in 39 programs of study that include English, religious studies, music and dramatic arts, mathematics and natural sciences to business, social sciences, education, criminal justice and nursing.

More than 3,000 students in Cleveland County Schools will start the 2020-21 with virtual only classes. Schools Superintendent Stephen Fisher confirmed the figure as part of a scheduled meeting of the Cleveland County Board of Education on Monday. The meeting was called to give an update on return to school efforts for the upcoming school year, which starts on Aug. 17.
   
 Among the 3,000-plus students attending school remotely, 75 of them will be a part of the districts Cleveland Innovations Virtual Academy, a long-term virtual home school program. The rest, Fisher said, will be doing remote learning through their traditional schools.
   
 "We did have students in every grade level represented in Cleveland Innovations. So as we've gotten to this point that really worked out the way we intended for it to work out," said Fisher. "The vast majority of those over 3,000 students are enrolled in their traditional schools but in enrolled in a remote cohort. Once we get all that data and schools have a chance to clean up their data, we will have a chance to pull the number of students in cohort A, cohort B and students remote only in each school."
   
 As part of the modified Plan B option for returning to school, Cleveland County Schools gives families an option to do entirely remote learning for the upcoming school year. Remote learners are spread across the county, with the exception of parts of Upper Cleveland County, where the lack of internet access is a problem for most families.
   
 Sign-ups for remote learning are ongoing, but the district has pulled the remote learning form from its web pages. Any parents wanting to swap to remote education for their child this school year will need to contact their child's principal to begin the application process.
   
 Student health checks
   
 While all students and staff will be given health screenings before entering schools each day, the district is still awaiting some guidance from the state on how to handle certain students, particularly those riding buses to school.
   
 Last week the district laid out plans to use parent attestation forms, but said they had not been given an answer as to how often forms need to be filled out.
   
 "One of the challenges and frustrations in dealing with this is that while there is guidance from the state there is not guidance in specific areas. There seems to be an absence of information as it relates to when these things should be collected, should it be daily or should it be weekly. We intend to do a bit of both," Fisher said.
   
 Fisher presented a sample attestation form, which asks three basic questions related to student symptoms of coronavirus. For all students the front of each form will need to be filled out and signed by parents once per month. On the back of the forms is a daily log parents are expected to sign reaffirming their child has either shown no symptoms of coronavirus nor come into contact with someone who has it.
   
 "There are some districts that are doing this once a month. There are some doing less frequently than once a month. We feel like less frequency than this potentially gets us into a situation of a lack of accountability," Fisher said.
   
 CCS also laid out plans for screening students who are brought to school with their parents or drive themselves.. Schools will be expected to restrict points of entry to one door for each group, and students will be given the symptom survey either before they get out of their car or before entering the building. All students and staff will have their temperatures taken before entering school each day.
   
 COVID leave and substitution plans
   
 For the 2020-21 school year all teachers will be given an additional 80 hours of coronavirus-related sick leave in addition to their normal allowance.
   
 The extra hours are meant to be used if a teacher comes into contact with someone with the virus, has a family member test positive or tests positive themselves.
   
 "Once those 80 hours, which is two weeks, is exhausted, they would need to get into their sick leave time," said Fisher.
   
 While discussing sick time for teachers, Fisher laid out new plans for the way schools will handle substitute teachers in the new school year.
   
 The district is allowing schools to hire permanent substitutes who will work in schools four days a week filling in for teachers not at school. If a substitute teacher is not needed on a given day, they will be used to complete extra work around the school.
   
 "Those will be the only outside subs we are having. If a school exceeds a number of subs for a day, they will need to use teacher assistants and additional staff to cover those absences because we will not have access to other subs," Fisher said.
   
 If a teacher is out for a leave of absence, the district will find a new teacher to fill their classroom, rather than use a substitute for their class.
   
 Elementary schools will get one full-time substitute, intermediate schools will get two, middle schools three and high schools will have four substitutes each.
   
 "This does a couple of things for us. It enables us to be able to control and keep tight who is in the building every day. You don't have people coming in and out of the building every day," said Fisher.
   
 Next week will be teachers' first week back in schools before the start of the 2020-21 school year. The CCS Board of Education will hold a regularly scheduled meeting on Monday and get a final update before the start of the school year on Aug 17.

In 2012, Zoe Saldana was cast as Nina Simone in a bio-pic which would end up being called, simply, _Nina_. The problems began right away - Nina Simone’s estate did not approve of the movie nor did they approve of Zoe’s casting. Once the images came out of Zoe-as-Nina, there was an even bigger uproar. The problem was, as explained in depth at the time, that Zoe is a light-skinned Black-Latina woman with “European” features, and for the film, they used makeup and a fake nose for her “Nina Simone drag” and the whole thing was just as problematic as can be. The film was put on a shelf somewhere for four years, and then released in 2016 to widespread condemnation in the Black community (and the film community too, because it was apparently a terrible movie overall).

The initial Vegas Loop system will carry passengers in autonomous electric cars (made by Tesla, of course) and possibly larger 12- to 16-passenger vans, traveling no more than 35 mph under the convention center but up to 155 mph beyond that. For longer inter-city routes, the company would use a Hyperloop system - whisking passenger-carrying pods along at 600+ mph through vacuum- sealed tunnels.  By contrast, Branson's Virgin Hyperloop would rely on above- ground tubes that let travelers achieve similar speeds, using the same magnetic levitation technology.      The government is getting on board to speed up the technology. Last year, the Transportation Department formed a new Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology Council, and last month that group issued new guidelines aimed at helping DOT create policies and a regulatory framework that can facilitate hyperloop projects created by private companies. Virgin Hyperloop noted that this could also make some of these projects eligible for federal funding assistance.  Earlier in July, the House of Representatives passed a bill called the Moving Forward Act that includes provisions aimed at advancing hyperloop transportation projects.
