"As long as you're using the test on a pretty frequent basis," Mina says, "you will be more likely than not to catch the person on the day they might go out and transmit. And they'll know to stay home."
 To be useful, such tests need to be widely available and affordable, he says. "I envision a time when everyone can order a pack of 50 tests for $50 and have those and use them every other day for a couple of months."
 When it comes to controlling the epidemic, that could be an appealing alternative to the current laboratory-based system, an overburdened process that has become a serious bottleneck. These days, some people are waiting a week or more for results, and by then they have potentially spread the virus to others.
 Highly accurate at-home tests are probably many months away. But Mina argues they could be here sooner if the FDA would not demand that tests for the coronavirus meet really high accuracy standards of 80 percent or better.
 A Massachusetts-based startup called E25Bio has developed this sort of rapid test. Founder and Chief Technology Officer Irene Bosch says her firm has field-tested it in hospitals. "What we learned is that the test is able to be very efficient for people who have a lot of virus," she says.
 It's nowhere near as good at detecting low levels of virus. But you can have the most sensitive test in the world, she says, and if you only test people once a month, that test, too, will miss a lot of people who are infected. So, her company is focusing on quick, easy and cheap.
 "These are very simple strips," she says. "They're [like] miniaturized pregnancy tests. So, you can imagine you can't find anything more simple than this."
 The sample for this test would come via a swab of the nose or mouth. Results would be available within 15 minutes, according to the manufacturer. Most important is the price.
 "The test has to be affordable. It cannot work if it's not affordable," Bosch says. "Right now it might cost $3 to make it [or] $4 to make it. So affordable will be what it costs."
 E25Bio would like to set the price at cost, though for the start-up company to stay in business, Bosch says, the test would need a government subsidy. The company has a local partner that's poised to produce a million of these tests a week, she says, adding that another company in the United Kingdom is poised to produce 8 million tests a day.
 E25Bio has asked the governor of Massachusetts to approve the rapid test for sale — not for use at home just yet, but in pharmacies and out in the community.
 To bring people back to work, or teachers and students back to the classroom safely, "this is the kind of test you need," Bosch says.
 The company would like to pair the test with a smartphone app. The app would take a photo of the test result and upload it to a public database. The information would be stripped of personal details and precise location, but if people volunteered to take this step, she says, the public could crowdsource information about the spread of the coronavirus that would be useful to researchers. The information would also be available to public health authorities.
 The company is in talks with the FDA about approving this test, even though it would be a departure for the federal agency, which has so far required a higher level of accuracy.
 She isn't sure how the FDA is responding to the company's request. "This is a Pandora's box and this like is a black box," she says with a laugh.
 In other words, the FDA doesn't want to take an action that backfires, and it also doesn't tend to reveal its thinking as it deliberates. The FDA told NPR that the agency weighs the benefits and risks of all coronavirus tests, but didn't elaborate on its thinking about this novel testing strategy.
 "There's always a tradeoff here. There's no free lunch," says Trevor Martin, chief executive officer of the Bay Area biotech startup, Mammoth Biosciences. His company is also making a rapid test, based on the gene-editing technology CRISPR. Though CRISPR is best known for its ability to edit DNA, part of that process involves pinpointing specific sequences. And by targeting the coronavirus' genetic sequence, this approach can be highly accurate, he says.
 "Our goal is to have a test that delivers extremely high-quality results with a single test. The same as you would get in a lab, or better," Martin says.
 His company's test isn't likely to be on the market until the end of the year, which seems like the distant future, considering the pace of the epidemic. He agrees tests need to be affordable, but he didn't name a price range for the test.
 Martin says precision has a place in controlling the epidemic, too. A test that can detect very low levels of virus is more likely to pick up someone with a mild infection, even in the absence of symptoms. And that's "super important if you want to prevent spread," he says.
 Other labs are pursuing tests based on CRISPR as well. And two companies have temporary approval by the FDA to sell a rapid test that detects certain proteins — antigens — from the coronavirus. These antigen tests are less accurate than the standard PCR tests, which detect genetic material from the virus. The average wholesale price for antigen tests is in the $20 range. Such tests are currently in limited supply, and available at hospitals, medical clinics and some doctor's offices.
 It's unlikely that there will be one single testing solution for the coronavirus, and the best blend of approaches is still a work in progress.

A place in the Premier League is up for grabs on Wednesday, with three teams in the chase for the second automatic promotion spot from the Championship on the final day of the second-tier season.
 Leeds United have already secured a return to the top flight after a 16-year absence. But West Bromwich Albion, Brentford and Fulham all have a chance of grabbing the runners-up spot and the lucrative prize it brings.
 The third promotion place is decided via a four-team playoff, with those slots also to be finalised by Wednesday’s action.
 Adding to the drama, all three relegation places have yet to be confirmed with Hull City, a Premier League club three years ago, currently bottom.
 West Brom are favourites to be holding a socially distanced promotion party, with Slaven Bilic’s side currently occupying second place.
 The Baggies know that victory at home to 14th-placed Queens Park Rangers will guarantee them a return to the elite after a two-year absence.
 But if the West Midlands side slip up, then the door is open for one of the two London clubs to sneak in on the final day.
 Brentford would be back in the top flight for the first time since 1947 if they beat Barnsley at home and West Brom fail to win.

Bloomberg) -- The latest tensions between China and the U.S. have put investors on edge and caused concern that a possible worsening of ties will dampen enthusiasm for riskier assets, market watchers say.
 News that Washington had ordered China to close a consulate sent equities in Hong Kong sliding, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index falling 1.9% at the close, snapping a three-day climb. The yuan also fell, erasing an earlier gain, and government bonds advanced.
 The sudden drop Wednesday is a reminder of the way that markets can suddenly tumble on a renewal of tensions between the world’s two biggest economies, a rivalry that already encompasses issues from technology to trade. Investors are now waiting to see how China responds to the U.S. demand to shutter the facility in Houston.
 Here’s what market watchers had to say about today’s slide:
 Nathan Chow, senior economist at DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong Branch
 This marks an escalation in the political aspect of the confrontation between China and the U.S. Investors will want to avoid risks in the near term, pressuring risk assets such as the yuan and stocks. However, I don’t expect the negative impacts of this incident to last for a long time, unless Beijing announces major retaliation measures. Considering we will see more similar cases of confrontation, I expect the yuan to end the year a level weaker than 7 per dollar.
 Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong
 This is only the latest escalation in a series that will end up in a crash for relations, for Hong Kong and for the yuan unless something changes. The markets will worry for all of five minutes and then resume rallying -- right up until they realize the China-U.S. dynamic blows everything up eventually. I’m massively bearish in the long term. So enjoy the ride and don’t believe in it for a moment.
 Kenny Wen, a strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co.
 People got scared about the U.S. consulate closure. It’s normal to be scared, because there were very little information about this and it’s a very big downside surprise. Investors are worried that this is another sign that the relationship between U.S. and China has worsened. And since there is little information about it, people tend to use this as an excuse to lock in profit.
 Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp.
 While everyone is well aware of the poor Sino-U.S. relations, nobody wants to see further escalation. Investors are worried the consulate closure could lead to a string of actions. All eyes will be on how both sides react later today.

MONTGOMERY — Citing a high infant mortality rate and lack of health care in the Black Belt, some state leaders are discussing the possibility of a midwifery program at Wallace State Community College in Selma.
 State Sen. Jim McClendon, R-Springville, sponsored a resolution in the Legislature this year to create a commission to study the feasibility of a midwifery program at Wallace State. The commission’s first meeting was set for Tuesday.
 McClendon said this is a preliminary meeting but hopes it is the beginning of addressing the problem of maternal and infant mortality in Alabama’s underserved communities.
 “We’ve ignored and done nothing about the infant mortality rate in the Black Belt and that is absolutely unforgivable,” McClendon said. “We’ve got babies dying. They’re not getting prenatal care, they may not have transportation and they just don’t have access.”
 Midwives have been allowed to practice legally in Alabama only since 2017, and there are no schools in the state that teach midwifery practices. In order to get training, those looking to be midwives have to go out of state or take online classes.
 Noel Leithart serves on the state board of midwives and says having a midwifery program in the state could help create more midwives and offer a more cost-effective way to become one.
 “Right now, people have to travel out of state … I think that can be pretty cost prohibitive,” Leithart said. “I think having something in state would be very advantageous to the midwives, to those who choose to be a midwife in the state and those who receive midwifery care.”
 Most midwives already practicing in the state live in north or central Alabama because they could only practice in Tennessee before Alabama’s Childbirth Freedom Act was signed into law in 2017. There are currently 15 certified professional midwives licensed in Alabama.
 McClendon said he hopes a program at Wallace State will not only encourage more students to become midwives but to also stay and serve in the area.
 “If we can properly train ladies that live in the Black Belt, then they’ll probably stay in the Black Belt, and at least these babies being born there will have some kind of care,” McClendon said.
 According to the Alabama Hospital Association, 29 of 67 counties in the state have hospitals with a labor and delivery unit. Selma is located in Dallas County, which has one delivering hospital.
 Alabama’s infant mortality rate has decreased in recent years, but disparities between Black and white infants’ and mothers’ survival rates still persist.
 The 2018 Black infant mortality rate was 11 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in Alabama compared to the white infant mortality rate of 5.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.
 James Mitchell, president of Wallace State Community College, said he thinks the program is a good idea but the meeting on Tuesday was just a starting point.
 “It’s going to be interesting to see what the commission comes up with and we’ll move from there,” Mitchell said.
 McClendon says he expects to get pushback from those in the medical community who opposed the passage of the 2017 law, but support will also come down to how much the program will cost and if the Legislature will approve the appropriation.

Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor are one of the most popular couples in the Bollywood industry and have a fairly huge fan following that adore them for their chemistry. The duo is often spotted together at parties, wedding receptions, screenings and their lunch or dinner dates. They are individually amongst the most popular stars in the industry and enjoy a huge fan following. During an interview last year, this Ki & Ka actor was quizzed about his marriage plans with Mala and Arjun said that whenever he will get married, he will inform the media as there is nothing to hide from his side, however, he is not looking to get married anytime soon. That said, Arjun Kapoor was also asked about the plain fact that being a public figure, there is a lot of curiosity around his personal life, and as an actor, how does he deal with it and to this, Arjun had said that he took time to adjust to it but he is not the first actor whose personal life is no more personal. “It’s a price you pay for stardom. If anybody doesn’t like it, he is in the wrong profession. I can’t stop anybody from writing about my personal life because there is an audience who wants to know more.

Yes, I am happy, why have so much explanation, yes I am happy. In the business (showbiz), everybody is at the receiving end of all of this (speculations about marriage).

Recounting working on their first Hollywood project, crime drama series "Snowfall" , he said, back in 2017 they had a diverse crew both behind and in front of the camera. "The thing is that's not going to solve the real deep structural problem. It's just a brick in the whole building that you need to build," he said. Citing the example of the first "Bad Boys" , El Arbi said Bay wanted to cast two black actors and people were "scared" as that had never happened before. "'Bad Boys' was a revolutionary movie back in the day because it proved that such a film can be successful. Now 'Bad Boys for Life' shows that people want to see a fun, cool action movie. It doesn't matter if the lead cast is African-American, Latino, or Asians." Whether it is putting a disclaimer with the Civil War epic "Gone With the Wind" for its long-debated controversial depiction of the black people and overt positive view of slavery or removing episodes from shows with blackface characters, El Arbi said every movie or series has to be seen in its context. "It's good to have a disclaimer, but where do you draw the line? You are doing it with 'Gone with the Wind' and sketches like 'Little Britain'. At the same time, are you going to take down 'True Lies' because it's a bad depiction of Muslims or hundreds and hundreds of movies where Muslims are depicted as terrorists?" he asked.

Even under the Netflix imprint, it seems that Nollywood films are yet to pass the Bechdel test. Traditionally, Nollywood has portrayed women as stoic and resilient, or perambulating behind the scenes as sit-back housewives with kitchen props. One might assume that this retrograde gender vision can be attributed to the blindness of male directors. But the Netflix films from women directors fare little better, with their obligatory femme fatales and their strong-willed protagonists, when one looks back at films such as _Lagos Bling_ and _Wedding Party_. _Elevator Baby_ at least enters, however superficially, into the subject of reproductive health.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins announced Wednesday that he's jumping into Louisiana's U.S. Senate race, trying to unseat Republican incumbent Bill Cassidy in a last-minute entrance into the competition as the candidate signup period begins. The Democratic mayor of the northwest Louisiana city, in office since December 2018, launched his campaign with an introductory video describing his Army career, including his graduation from the U.S. military academy at West Point and his deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He said Washington's poor handling of the coronavirus outbreak persuaded him to jump into the Senate race on the Nov. 3 ballot. “I’m running for United States Senate because our country and state are at a crossroads. We face a virus that threatens our lives, our safety and our economy, but Washington’s political games are only making us sick,\" Perkins, a lawyer, said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. \"Together, we can demand a government that serves all of our people, not just the wealthy and well-connected.” He joins at least three other announced Democratic contenders trying to oust Cassidy, who is favored for reelection. But Perkins is the only one in elected office, with a natural platform for fundraising. Still, the Shreveport mayor faces a difficult road — taking on a Republican incumbent in a red state who has millions of dollars in the bank. Perkins will need to raise cash quickly to be a viable challenger. Perkins' announcement came as the qualifying period for Louisiana’s fall U.S. Senate race and other congressional elections opens Wednesday and runs through Friday. Perkins was expected to file his paperwork to get on the ballot Thursday. Cassidy, a doctor from Baton Rouge, is seeking a second six-year term after defeating three-term Democratic...

If ever we could use a balm from the ways of our messed up world, now is the time. One method I've found to escape from reality over the years is through the movies. And though trips to the cinema are on hold, our TV sets are where most current movies are finding homes.      Yes, there's a lot of emotional turmoil and grisly horror in much of today's film fare, but once in a while, something pleasant slips through. "Fisherman's Friends" is one of those. It's a real charmer, a gentle and funny little film that would be a perfect half of a twin bill with ""The Full Monty." It's been kicking around for a couple of years, had a release in its native England in early 2019, and is finally seeing the light of day in the U.S.      Based on true events from 2009, but fictionalized left and right, it tells the unlikely story of a bunch of small-town men, most of them lobster fishermen, all close friends, in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, who, after a hard day out on the water, would retire to their local pub, The Golden Lion, for a few pints and a lengthy singalong of traditional sea shanties.      No, nothing all that unlikely there. That part comes in with the introduction of four city dwellers, visiting Port Isaac for a day of yachting, hearing the 10 men - known collectively as Fisherman's Friends - singing, and believing that they could be the next successful boy band or, as mentioned in a quick visual gag, buoy band.      These visitors work at a music management company in London and are always on the lookout for the next big thing. But their belief in Fisherman's Friends is a gag, one that three of the four don't let the fourth city boy in on, and coerce into getting the 10 a cappella singers to sign on.      OK, that's not quite the way the real story played out, but the film's version works just fine. The city boys think the villagers are rubes, and the villagers think the city boys are wankers. Truth is - at least the truth told in the film - they are wankers, though Danny (Daniel Mays), whose leg his pals are pulling, appears to be a decent fellow, and is only doing the job his fun- loving but uncaring boss Troy (Noel Clarke) has ordered him to do.      By the time Danny catches on, he's already convinced the initially uncooperative fisherman and group frontman Jim (James Purefoy) to take a chance with him, and has given his word that they'll be treated honorably. When his boss tells him to end the charade, he can't, because he's a man of his word.      That's about as dramatic as the film gets, and in its lengthy-feeling two-hour running time, there's a lot of filler for viewers to deal with. The tough, hearts-of-gold fishermen continually rag on good-natured Danny, but nothing develops from that. There's a two-minute segment of trouble from the Coastal Guard, but that fizzles out. Tempers flare during a trivia night at the pub, and are immediately quashed. There's a boating accident, a daring rescue and a concussion. But that's never mentioned again.      The script tosses in a love interest for Danny - Jim's divorced daughter, and single mom, Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton), and offers up back stories on Jim's sometimes negative attitude, Jim's father Jago's (David Hayman) history with the sea, and a fleeting mention of Danny once being in rehab. But it turns out to be a stream of small stories that keep starting, don't go anywhere, and are forgotten, and then there's another small story.      The only other bits of drama that do take root involve some money problems that could affect the fate of The Golden Lion AKA the heart of the village, and the plot point that reduces the number of singing fishermen from 10 to nine (With so much of the story being fictionalized, did the filmmakers really need to keep a death in there?)      But aside from those instances, the film is unrepentantly upbeat, even featuring some last-minute extremely happy storytelling to cap it off. It's not very believable, and kind of twee, but that part really did happen.      "Fisherman's Friends" will be available on digital and On Demand beginning July 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Fisherman's Friends"   Written by Piers Ashworth, Meg Leonard, and Nick Moorcroft; directed by Chris Foggin   With James Purefoy, Daniel Mays, David Hayman, Tuppence Middleton   Rated PG-13

Watford’s hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a double blow on Tuesday when they were thrashed 4-0 at home by Manchester City and then slipped into the Premier League relegation zone after fellow strugglers Aston Villa beat Arsenal in the late game.
 City were inspired by Raheem Sterling who struck twice before halftime at Vicarage Road while Phil Foden and Aymeric Laporte scored after the break as the visitors racked up their 13th straight win over Watford in all competitions.
 The previous two meetings between the sides resulted in an 8-0 home league win for Pep Guardiola’s City side in September and a 6-0 victory in last year’s FA Cup final.
 Watford’s only consolation was that the scoreline could have been even worse on Tuesday, although with Villa beating visiting Arsenal 1-0, their fate is no longer in their hands.
 Watford are level on 34 points with Villa but have dropped below them into the relegation zone on goal difference. Second-bottom Bournemouth have 31 points but could still escape.
 Watford face Arsenal away in their final game on Sunday when Villa, who have the better goal difference by one, visit West Ham United. Bournemouth travel to Everton knowing they must win and hope the other two lose to have a chance of staying up.
 Hayden Mullins, in temporary charge of Watford following the sacking of manager Nigel Pearson on Sunday, watched powerless from the touchline as City went through their routines.

Warm, sunny weather greeted customers at J Bell Cellars northwest of Zillah over the weekend.
 Owner Wes Teslo opened 13 of his 30 tables and allowed people to set out a blanket on the grass for the follow-up to a successful first weekend of outdoor dining. Adherence to strict mask and social distancing guidelines pleasantly surprised Teslo, who believes it’s unfair most other breweries, wineries and taprooms aren’t allowed the same opportunities.
 “We’re glad to be open in any way, shape or form,” Teslo said. “We’re one of the lucky ones.”
 Local health district put out a joint statement last week clarifying that breweries and wineries in Yakima, Benton and Franklin counties cannot open outdoor seating unless they offer full meals from an on-site kitchen and “are substantially equivalent to a restaurant.” The health districts pointed to a letter from State Health Secretary John Wiesman that cited the draw for tourists from outside the area as well as “a social setting ... that can increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission.”
 Yakima, Benton and Franklin counties are still in a modified Phase 1 of the state’s four-step reopening plan because of a high number of cases.
 Opposition to the guidelines appears to be virtually unanimous among the region’s wineries and breweries, which Kana Wineries general manager Katherine Goodman said are like “one big family.” Even businesses such as Bale Breaker and Owen Roe winery, which are uncomfortable with the idea of welcoming guests until coronavirus cases drop significantly, believe others should have the option to open outdoor seating.
 Goodman said a meeting last Thursday with lawmakers, representatives from 25 wineries, the Yakima County Health District and the Washington Wine Institute covered how wineries can safely return to serving customers on site. Kana owner Palmer Wright advocated for the cause in a letter to the state. Goodman said another decision from Gov. Jay Inslee is expected July 28.
 “We’re just waiting to get everybody’s information on what their protocols are,” Goodman said. “The other thing is we’re also waiting for is the health department to reply to the questions that we had for them on Thursday.”
 Kana holds a Class 1 restaurant license. It can serve beer along with wine, and initially planned to open while serving food such as cheese, salami and hot dogs. But Goodman said the state told them they need a Class 2 license, which would require another hand washing sink for employees.

Biden promised to pay for his latest plan by reducing tax breaks for real estate investors with annual incomes of more than $400,000, while increasing compliance with existing tax law for high earners. As he spoke, the Trump reelection campaign released a statement accusing Biden of embracing an “unaffordable left-wing agenda” that would force him to raise taxes on the middle class. Biden has vowed not to do that but has endorsed rolling back the GOP-led tax cuts that are the Trump administration's signature policy accomplishment.

“That first week, they were thrilled to be back and it was kind of the same thing,” Felderhoff said. “They worked hard. They seemed happy to be around each other and now they’re wearing masks at different times and you’re having to remind them about being too close. Their attitudes were good.”
 The weightlifting plan Felderhoff and the coaches put together at the beginning of June has had to be scaled back some due to the time off, but he said overall the athletes are embracing the challenges.
 “We obviously didn’t do the workout we would have done, but on the football side, we threw the football around and worked on blocking schemes,” Felderhoff said. “We’ve been working on some of the base stuff and have been adding to it. I’m happy where we are. It would be nice to be further down the road, but we’re not. We’re fine though. It’s going to take some time.”
 Felderhoff said he believes strongly in how much kids need athletics and school, but the challenge is how to accomplish those safely.
 As long as a season gets to be played, Felderhoff will be happy, he said.
 “I prefer playing over nothing,” Felderhoff said. “I’d like to play 10 games like normal, but I don’t know that it’s going to be a possibility, so I’ll take whatever over nothing. …In the climate we’re in with the virus, there is so much that comes into play. I think the is a solution somewhere in the middle. People are talking, but it seems like nobody is listening.”

In Florida, Miami-Dade County has 82 shelters with 112,000 spaces without social distancing and is also negotiating with hotels. For smaller storms, the county's director of emergency management, Frank Rollason, says he plans to open double the number of shelters he normally would in order to spread people out. But for a Category 3 hurricane or stronger, he says he could need every last one of those 112,000 spaces. Expanding capacity outside of that is limited because not every building is strong enough to withstand a hurricane. And the stronger the storm, the more people who would need to evacuate.
 Other details, including staffing and health-screening protocols, also must be worked out with hotels. And it's unclear who will get available hotel rooms. In Florida, county emergency managers will decide. Some say they are reserving their rooms for people who have tested positive for the coronavirus or are at high risk for contracting COVID-19. Emergency managers in other states say that decisions about who gets rooms could be made at the last minute.

Delhi, India NewsVoirAlthough India has announced the launch of its indegenious vaccine, its effectiveness can still be debated. Until such time that it can be judged how much of the virus infectivity the vaccine can reduce, nanotechnology can provide a significant solution to the growing challenges of COVID-19. Many prominent studies show how fully developed nanotechnology products can significantly reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus from person to person. Using their extensive knowledge of materials and composites, NanoChemiqs has launched a reusable and antiviral face mask. Dubbed ViroWipe FM01, the face mask is claimed to be the finest face mask on the market right now with properties of both N95 and normal cloth masks. Its proprietary Anti-Viral trap and kill technology makes it a unique product that not only ensures proper filtration of contaminants but also offers four Anti- Viral layers and 6 levels of extra protection. Thereby, making it a 99.95 safe face mask. The face mask has been equipped with non-metal nano technology making it reusable upto 90 gentle washes. Since the nanotechnology treatment of the mask effectively reduces the virus and bacteria infectivity on contact, it can function as a constant sterilization solution. Thereby making the face mask ideal for both industrial workers and normal citizens. In fact, since it has been made using recyclable material, the face mask will also help in reducing biomedical waste and carbon footprint, the former being a cause of grave concern in the Capital. In fact, of the 200 biomedical waste treatment facilities in the country, two are in Delhi and one is in Mumbai. In these two cities alone the facilities are functioning at 70-75 and 70 capacities respectively. Delhi currently produces 27 tonnes of non-COVID biomedical waste and up to 11 tonnes of COVID-19 related waste every day. Meanwhile, Mumbai has been generating nine tonnes of COVID-19 waste and six tonnes of non-COVID biomedical waste every day. In this regard, one of the best features of the mask is the anti-Leaching property useful for daily use, the face mask reduces the risk of spread of contamination even when its being washed or kept along other household materials. Besides its virus fighting properties, ViroWipe comes in five different vibrant colors and in three different sizes. Further, with all the required certification ISO 18184 in place, the face mask is a trustworthy product in the market. ViroWipe is also Oeko-Tex class 1 standard and even safer for toddlers and newborns. The face mask can be purchased online on Amazon or the nearest company distributors. The company CEO Mr. Sasha Bose added, We firmly believe that our mask is the finest quality personal protection gear that offers the filtration efficiency upto N95 specification yet comfortable and durable cloth mask. In fact, other than our proprietary technology, the mask has been created using reusable materials. Which means that we will be directly reducing the amount of biomedical waste being generated by offering a safeguard that has been fully created with reusable materials. According to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Delhi generates 25 tonnes of biomedical waste each day. Which means, in order to reduce community transmission, effective management of biomedical waste is of utmost importance. This was highlighted in a recent article that reported 40 COVID positive cases among sanitation workers, of which 15 had already lost their lives. In fact, there are rules and regulations that support the proper disposal of biomedical waste, which if mixed with the general waste or poorly packed, sanitation workers could be infected. However, even with the rules and regulation in place DPCC informed the National Green Tribunal of the 48 healthcare facilities in Delhi that did not comply with biomedical waste management rules. NanoChemiqs has three different verticals ViroWipe, SafeSpace and SafeFleet. Each of them provides nanotechnology based products for personal use, workspaces and transport fleet services. All three portfolios of the company currently offers multiple products across the board. Image ViroWipe FM01 PWRPWR

As a rule of thumb, if you can afford to, you should save an annual percentage of your salary equal to at least half your age when you start saving. So if you start saving when you’re 36, you should consider putting at least 18% of your salary in your pension each year until you retire, maintaining this percentage as your age and (hopefully) earnings increase. This should provide income of around two thirds of your pre-retirement income, often called ‘replacement income’, which should enable you to afford a comparable lifestyle in retirement to the one you had in work, based on the assumption that life in retirement is typically cheaper, and many of life’s big purchases and raising a family will already have been paid for.

Bloomberg) -- A supplier of tear gas to the police and the military is experiencing a surge in demand for a launcher it makes for home use as consumers anxious about civil unrest arm themselves for self defense.
 Byrna Technologies Inc.’s Byrna HD resembles a pistol and comes in seven colors -- including hot pink and desert tan. It can fire a solid ball about the size of a quarter or ones filled with a blend of tear gas and pepper spray.
 The chemical balls burst on impact and, the company says, can “incapacitate” a target “for up to 30 minutes by causing temporary blindness and respiratory distress.”
 Sales have been fueled by anxieties over the coronavirus pandemic and the waves of protests across the country that followed the May 25 death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American Minneapolis man.
 That incident touched off mostly peaceful demonstrations, though some were accompanied by violence and looting.
 Fox News host Sean Hannity last month told viewers of his program that he owned several Byrna HD weapons and “It could hopefully be an alternative in a very volatile, dangerous situation.”
 “They even come equipped with lasers so you really can’t miss for accuracy,” Hannity said.
 Online orders worth nearly $2.5 million flowed in over the next 24 hours -- a one-day haul that exceeded the total orders for all of the launcher’s first 14 months on the market. It also exceeded the net revenue of $1.34 million the company reported for the preceding six months, ending May 31.
 A headline in an orange band running along the top of the website’s homepage says: “Due to unprecedented demand, shipping for Byrna HD Launchers is 8+ weeks.”
 Byrna, based in Andover, Massachusetts, attributes the sudden popularity of the weapon, which it calls “an effective non-lethal option for home safety and personal security,” to the coronavirus outbreak and street protests.
 “The general level of apprehension among the population as a whole has led many people to seek means of protecting themselves and their families in the event that there is a breakdown or a fraying of the fabric of civil society,” the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Sales of conventional firearms have also risen this year. Background checks compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a proxy for gun purchases, jumped to a record in June.
 Shares of Byrna are up more than 500% this year on the over the counter market. Byrna has nearly tripled in value since Floyd’s death alone.
 The launcher retails for about $325. Extra 68-caliber chemical ammunition goes for $300 for a box of 95. Target posters, laser sights and tactical shoulder holsters are extra.
 The company, which had 14 employees at the end of last year, says that buyers don’t need to undergo background checks or procure permits. It calls the launchers “the safest and most effective non-lethal self-defense weapon on the market today” and says customers can “save lives without the risk of taking one.”
 But experts say that doesn’t mean that devices like these won’t hurt people.
 Diane Calello, executive and medical director of the New Jersey Poison Center, said tear gas and pepper spray from any source causes spasms and pain in the eyes and can target the respiratory system.
 “The problem is that while the stated goal is incapacitation without injury, that’s not always the case,” she said.
 She hasn’t studied the Byrna HD but has treated people exposed to tear gas. If the quantity of chemical irritants is high enough, it can cause long-term or permanent injuries, including burns to the cornea and respiratory injuries, specifically for those with vulnerable conditions like asthma, she said.
 Byrna’s website acknowledges the risk, saying “chemical irritants can cause severe injury, permanent disabilities, and in rare cases, death.” It recommends that medical assistance should be sought immediately in the case of accidental discharge or exposure.
 “While the Byrna HD is a non-lethal device, it is still a dangerous weapon and if used improperly can result in criminal and/or civil liability,” the company says in its Terms of Use. The weapon should never be pointed or fired at someone’s head, neck or back, the company adds.
 In a statement to Bloomberg News, Byrna said that its training manual provides instruction on the device’s proper use and “makes clear that the only responsible use of the Byrna is for self-defense purposes.”
 Soaring Sales
 Sales have soared this year. The company sold nearly $1.1 million worth of Byrna HD devices in the three months ending May 31, according to its most recent filing with regulators. That is 36 times the value of devices it sold in the same period a year earlier. Those numbers don’t include the sales sparked by Hannity in June, suggesting Byrna’s next financial report will show even stronger sales.
 Bryan Ganz, Byrna’s chief executive, who declined to comment for this article, said in a June 9 press release that “the biggest challenge we are currently facing is keeping up with rapidly growing demand.”
 It’s a dramatic change in fortune for the company. Byrna hasn’t posted a quarterly profit in more than a decade of operation. The boost in sales and an anticipated infusion of capital, the company said, represents “substantial progress towards alleviating doubt as to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern and that substantial doubt may be removed by the end of the current fiscal year.”
 The company says it plans to open in September a U.S. manufacturing facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to augment one in Pretoria, South Africa, and will apply for a listing on Nasdaq Inc.
 State Restrictions
 “We are focused on meeting current demand for the Byrna HD by increasing production capacity but we also have a lot of exciting plans for the future,” Byrna said in its statement.
 Byrna says the device isn’t a firearm under U.S. law because it uses compressed air to fire its rounds like a paintball gun instead of gunpowder. A spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives declined to comment but referred to an online guide that defines a firearm as a weapon that relies on an explosive charge.
 Some U.S. states and cities have set their own restrictions, mostly on the ammunition. Nevada, for example, prohibits the tear gas and pepper ammo so only the pepper-only version is shipped there. California won’t allow either so the company only sells its plastic impact rounds to consumers there -- except in San Francisco where they don’t ship at all.
 New York City, Portland, Oregon and Washington D.C., won’t allow the device to be sold at all.

True to form, protesters over the weekend took down fencing and lit a fire at the building's entryway. As a statement from the Portland police put it, "dozens of people with shields, helmets, gas masks, umbrellas, bats and hockey sticks approached the doors" of the courthouse -- but surely it was just a misunderstanding that led the federal officers to believe they had to repulse them with tear gas.
