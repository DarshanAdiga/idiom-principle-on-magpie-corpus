It was a chase nicely set up by Ben Stokes' blitz with the bat. The Englishman came out with positive intent and went berserk from the word go. He fired Rajasthan to an excellent start and despite getting out, the start that he provided always kept Rajasthan afloat.

Of the state’s 865 school entities that receive report cards, the median attendance rate for the 2019-20 school year was more than 96%. Only 100 districts didn’t post higher attendance rates this year than last, a Tribune analysis shows. Last year’s attendance rate was just under 95%.
 For some metrics, such as surveys on school culture and climate, ISBE collected no data for the 2019-20 school year. For other metrics like attendance, the suspension of in-person instruction likely affected the results, according to the school board.
 “A standardized method of reporting attendance was not possible in the spring during the suspension of in-person instruction, some schools had access to technology while other schools had paper packets,” Ayala said.
 With districts deciding on their own when a student should be considered absent, the vast majority logged high attendance rates — even with the disruption of the pandemic.
 Districts that previously indicated struggles with chronic truancy reported that it wasn’t as significant a problem last year. For example, Chicago Public Schools reported more than 20,000 fewer chronically truant students.
 Ayala said there will have to be higher-quality attendance data going forward, regardless of whether a school is hybrid, in person or online.
 Another metric impacted by the pandemic is graduation rate data, according to the school board. Graduation rates cannot be compared to previous years because the state changed requirements for students expecting to graduate in spring 2020.
 However, some data points were included in the 2020 report card.
