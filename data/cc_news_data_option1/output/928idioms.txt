As with most phones, the zoom on here is only good quality until about 5x and then it starts to go downhill. While 10x still looks quite good, 30x will get you a grainy shot - even in full daylight. Still, it is impressive that a phone can get up to 30x zoom, and in full daylight, it's not half bad. In the photo collage below, you can see the see how the clarity devolves after 10x, but is quite good up until then. Serious photographers may disregard the higher zooms, but for everyone else - when capturing the moment is more important than detail and clarity - these zooms are killer features. These pictures were taken in full daylight.

She was quickly embraced by the crew, though, and by its captain.
 “The lesson that I learned that day has stuck with me,” she said. “Be authentic. Show up and be yourself. Showing up is the best thing that you can do to push the boundaries of what people expect of women.”
 All the crew really cared about, she said, was her competence.
 “They did not care about what my gender was, as long as if there was a fire I could put it out, if we were on mission they could trust that I would make the right call and I would bring them home safely,” she said.
 Treece proved herself among the best on her crew and gained the respect of those aboard, she said. Later, when she was pregnant with her son, she made sure to stay visible throughout her pregnancy.
 “I wanted the sailors to see me teaching submarine tactics nine months pregnant,” she said. “… I wanted my coworkers not to be weird about me pumping breast milk on my breaks.”
 Treece found that her own brand of leadership could succeed in a male- dominated field.
 “It is all of our responsibilities to push the envelope for our daughters and sons so they live in a world where career is determined by passion alone and not gender,” she said.
 The Institute for Executive Women provides professional leadership training to women through seminars, coaching and networking.
 Catherine Blake, president and founder of the organization, announced during the breakfast that the institute is collecting donations of shoes appropriate for work for men and women enrolled in programs sponsored by the STAR Foundation in Brunswick.
 Shoe donations can be brought to the next breakfast April 3 or to the STAR Foundation office in The Wick, 1612 Newcastle Street.

Not only did the Kays win the regional that they hosted, but they also picked up their 26th win of the season, a new high mark in Kankakee boys basketball history, and a moment coach Chris Pickett doesn’t think his team will fully comprehend for a while.
 “When you’re in the moment in the middle of the season, it doesn’t hit you that much,” Pickett said. “It will really hit us late March, early April, that we set a record.
 “Our name is gonna be on the record board and these guys deserve it. It’s special.”
 Just as they did in their January meeting in Kankakee, a game the Kays ultimately won by a point, the Rockets made their presence strongly felt in the first half. After the teams swapped 10 lead changes over the first quarter and change, the Rockets slowly gained control of the game, taking a lead as large as seven points before the Kays closed the gap at the end of a first half that saw the road underdogs lead 35-34.
 “We came out in the first half and didn’t execute, but with that being said, we were only down one point at the half,” Pickett said. “The guys were excited. It’s a regional championship, there’s a lot of energy.”
 Part of the Kays’ woes came thanks to a heaping batch of foul trouble, as all five starters picked up at least two fouls by the intermission.
 That forced them to dig deep into the bench early, but only Lavell McIntosh picked up a third foul before the break as the Kays hunkered down over the final couple minutes.
 “I turned to my assistant and said, ‘Typically guys with two fouls, we make them sit,’” Pickett said. “He said, ‘If we make them sit this time, there is no next time,’ so we had to start juggling like that. We took a gamble and were able to manage it.”
 The Kays needed a jolt to open the second half, and that’s exactly what senior guard Deylon Johnson gave them. Johnson made a pair of quick buckets and assisted Rashard Harris on a third to give the Kays an early third-quarter lead that continued to grow until the 12-point final margin, the biggest lead either team held all game.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The delegate winner on Super Tuesday is former Vice President Joe Biden. The Associated Press delegate count shows Biden with a lead of 97 delegates over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday. This is a big change from just a couple weeks ago when Biden was on the ropes after weak showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden built his delegate lead by racking up huge victories in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia while scoring a narrow win in Texas. The presidential primary contest could now become a drawn-out two-man battle to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

“The South Dakota Department of Health’s laboratory was sent the testing kits to test for COVID-19, and they are up and running and ready,” Healy said. “Thankfully, the swab that we would use to test for COVID-19 is the same one that we use for influenza. That is great because we anticipated a bad influenza year, so we made sure to stock up on those.”
 Turnaround time for a COVID-19 test will be about a day, unless the lab in Pierre were to get backed up, she said
 If an individual believes they may have COVID-19 and it is not an emergency situation, the CDC recommends that they call before going to the doctor, so medical personnel can prepare and give the patient specific instructions.
 “Do not come to a clinic or hospital without calling first,” Havermann said. “This will be key in preventing transmission.”
 In a non-emergency situation the health-care provider will contact the Department of Health and together they will decide if the person calling can stay home and self-isolate, not go to work, not use public transportation, Healy said.
 “Depending on the symptoms, they may say, ‘Yes, we really think that you need to come in and visit your doctor. OK, are you going to come into the clinic, or you’re going to be coming into an emergency department?’” Healy said. “In those cases, they would say to mask yourself immediately, and tell them that you believe you have COVID-19 so that the health-care professionals — wherever they are — can make sure to protect themselves.”
 For many, COVID-19 would likely be a minor illness; it’s a cold. They may not even know they have it.
 But for others, it could be life threatening, Healy said.
 “It’s a lot like influenza in that it really depends on your age, your health and on any comorbidities you may have,” Healy said. “This is a respiratory illness, so people who have lung disease and heart disease are likely to have more severe effects from it than younger, healthier people. So it really depends on the person and their health at the time.”
 As far as preparedness goes, Yankton is in a good place, she said.
 “We have a wonderful community that is very responsive,” Healy said. “I really believe that the community of Yankton is well prepared, no matter what health care facility people use or health care provider.”
 Avera and several other Yankton health care providers met Friday to further discuss community preparedness for COVID-19, she said.
 “We are ready if this only brings five cases to our community or if this brings 500,” Healy said. “I’m really proud to be a part of Yankton because I think our responsiveness is excellent.”

Hastings St. Cecilia — the defending champion — survived to beat Crofton 62-60 in Friday night’s Class C2 semifinals of the Nebraska State Girls Basketball Tournament at Devaney Sports Center in Lincoln.
 The loss sends Crofton, now 24-4, to today’s (Saturday) 1 p.m. third place game against Oakland-Craig.
 In the end, the Lady Warriors showed what their coach called “a lot of heart.”
 “Our kids are definitely very mentally tough and have the heart of a champion,” Crofton head coach Aaron Losing said.
 “We played a team with that same heart and came out on the short end of the stick.”
 Hastings St. Cecilia advances to tonight’s (Saturday) 8:30 p.m. state title game against Ponca at Pinnacle Bank Arena.
 In what was a rematch of last year’s championship game, Crofton got a basket from senior Alexis Arens with 13 seconds left to cut the deficit to 61-60.
 Hastings St. Cecilia’s Makenna Asher then made one free throw with 7.1 seconds remaining, and Crofton got a three-point attempt from Arens ahead of the buzzer, but it clanked off the glass.
 That sealed the win for the Hawkettes (25-3), who dominated the first half and built a 36-24 halftime lead.
 “To give up 36 points in a half is obviously not going to cut it very well in this setting,” Losing said.

Some food for thought when turning clocks ahead one hour (officially at 2 a.m. Sunday): Daylight Saving Time is a friend or foe depending on whom is asked. To moms or dads trying to convince little tykes it’s bedtime during summer months, when the rays of the still bright shining sun on cloudless days suggest they might be pulling a fast one, it can be a curse. On the other hand, to those who might want to do a little gardening, jogging or golfing at the end of the workday, it can be a blessing.
 Parents aren’t the only ones with mixed feelings. People in different professions subscribe to various opinions as well. A trend among a growing number of physicians is to dismiss DST as a health risk because, among other things, it disrupts our daily cycles. Then, of course, there are those old- school docs who might suggest the extra daylight is healthy because it affords those who sit at a desk or computer all day an opportunity for outdoor physical activity – you know, exercise or something akin to it.
 It’s even a toss-up among farmers. Dairymen say cows tend to disfavor it because starting the day earlier interrupts their routine, but farmers who still hire human laborers to harvest crops continue to bask in the additional sunlight.

Shopkeepers in the Pier Village Market and the proprietor of Dutchmans received noticed late last month that they would have to be out by May 31.
 The proposal will require Island Planning Commission approval because the property is located in the Village Preservation District. The plans also will need county commission approval of a zoning change from village mixed use to planned development.
 “The application plans to amend the Glynn county Zoning Ordinance by creating the St. Simons Art Museum Planned Development District,” according to the application.
 The museum building would face Mallery Street, with high columns flanking the entrance. Plantings will border the front. “The main entry to the museum will be set back from the property line along Mallery Street to allow space for planting and to soften and enframe the new museum, providing a green relief ... “ the application said.
 The plan indicates the Greek Revival style of the building leans heavily on the influence of architect Charles B. Cluskey, who built the St. Simons Lighthouse and its accompanying light keeper’s house. Clusky also designed the old Governor’s Mansion in Milledgeville and the Old Medical College in Augusta, both “considered not only some of the finest examples of Greek Revival Architecture in Georgia but also in the nation,” the application states.
 Using a ratio of one parking space per 400 square feet of floor space for regular museum visitors, and one space per 70 square feet during lectures and events, existing parking spaces in the area would accommodate the facility’s needs, the application states. There will be 10 employee parking spaces on site, the application states. An open space along 15th Street on the backside of the museum would be converted into a terraced lawn.
 Existing trees on the property and nearby would be given special attention from a licensed arborist. “Tree preservation and replacement will meet or exceed the St. Simons Island Tree Canopy Preservation ordinance,” according to the application. “The finished landscape will be exemplary to the Village’s unique setting.”
 Said Bishop: “He’s made certain to put together the finest group of professionals in this part of Georgia to bring this to fruition. It really is an extraordinary act of generosity.”

By Jan. 21, the U.S. confirmed its first case of the disease, and about a month later, the CDC confirmed a case of community spread of the disease among individuals who hadn’t travel abroad or had contact with those who had.
 Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that preparation and communication would be key factors to slowing the spread of the disease, which has been found in 98 countries and regions.
 Since then, medical facilities across the U.S. have been preparing for a possible outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in their local communities.
 “We are just in the planning phase, making sure that our facility is prepared,” Liz Healy, infection prevention coordinator at Yankton’s Avera Sacred Heart Hospital (ASHH) told the Press & Dakotan. “We have done a number of things in coordination with the state. We are planning for the possibility of having a large influx of patients. We hope that doesn’t happen, of course, but we are planning for it. We are ready for it.”
 Organizers at ASHH are making sure there is ample supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PDE), including gowns, gloves and masks, she said.
 “We are also working with other local entities like the ambulance service, Yankton County Office of Emergency Preparedness, Yankton Medical Clinic, Avera Medical Group Family Medicine, all the clinics and the Human Services Center (HSC),” Healy said. “(We want) to make sure we are all on the same page as to how we’re going to inform each other if, say, the Human Services Center is sending us one of their patients whom they believe has COVID-19. We want to make sure that our ambulance services know about it so that they can prepare and that the Emergency Department would know about it, so that they can prepare for that patient.”
 The Press & Dakotan also reached out to Yankton Medical Clinic about its preparations for a possible outbreak of COVID-19.
 “There are no cases in South Dakota,” Cheryl Havermann, director of marketing for Yankton Medical Clinic, told the Press & Dakotan. “Yankton healthcare facilities are working together so we are prepared should the virus spread to South Dakota.”
 The key to avoiding the virus is prevention, she said.
 “Wash your hands, cover your mouth when you cough, if you are sick stay home, avoid touching your mouth, eyes and nose,” Havermann said. “These are all things that we should practice every day to prevent any virus transmission.”
 Preparation is a community effort, Healy said.
 With that in mind, testing for the presence of the virus no longer has to be done by the CDC, she said.

As I’ve mentioned before, it’s a good idea to do some preseason scouting from the road using your binoculars, staying as far away from the birds as possible, so you don’t spook them.
 If you can get close enough to the birds without spooking them, I like to go with a locator or shock call such as an owl, crow and coyote howls, which startles or shocks the bird into giving away its location by gobbling.
 This works extremely well late afternoon when the birds are getting ready to giving the hunter a starting location on opening day.
 My spring hunts success can be cut short by heavy spring rains as several of the locations I hunt are on minimum maintenance roads or on farmer’s lanes. If you want to lose your hunting rights quickly, use four wheel drive and plow into your hunting location, tearing up their lane, as you’re not going to make any points doing this and will surely need to find a new place to hunt the following season.
 I do everything to not upset the landowner and to get to some of my hunting spots, I’m required to hike in at least a half mile, which doesn’t bother me, unless something changes dramatically as by not tearing things up I’ll have a place to hunt next season.
 In South Dakota there are several opening dates depending on where you have drawn your tag, below are those on the eastern side of the stats in areas where most of us hunt.
 Those going after turkey with a bow will have an opportunity to do so on the 4th of April, with the archery season closing the end of May, on the 31st.
 If you’re hunting the Spring Prairie turkey season you’ll have to wait until April 11, and end hunting by May 31.
 Nebraska’s opens its Archery season on March 25, while those youth, after turkeys with their shotguns head out into the woods and fields earlier on April 11.
 The statewide Spring Shotgun turkey season then, opens on April 18, with all seasons shutting down on May 31.
 The early season can be a little tough to hunt as the gobblers have plenty of hen action at this time of the year, with at least some of the hens being receptive.
 This is when you’ll have gobblers hang up, stopping just out of range, not wanting to leave their harem, if your calls sound sweet enough, you may get a gobbler to come on down, but if the gobbler won’t come, you may want to work on the boss hen.
 She just like the boss gobbler runs the show and when a gobbler is strutting and moving to your call, then hangs up, that’s when I try to infuriate the hen to a point where she’s not going to take any more of the guff from this loud mouth hen.
 As she calls to the hung up gobbler, this is when I start working on her, getting on her after each time she calls and with each call getting a little louder than she is and unless the gobbler returns to her, she’ll come over, ready to kick the tail feathers out of this hen trying to take her man away from her.
 When I’m working the hen, I’ll use my slate call and once the hen responds, I’ll get on her with my diaphragm as I’m able to keep coming back at her, louder each time she responds.
 Once I have the hen headed my way, the gobbler who was strutting and gobbling, will come out of the strut, seeing his hen is gone and if he can see her will either follow her or come in on his own.
 Early in the season, I like to put out my Dakota Decoy gobbler and hen as well as another hen decoy that I place flat on the ground, resembling a receptive hen.
 As the season progresses, in place of decoys I like to use a turkey fan, with a sharp dowel glued to it and stick it in the ground off to my left a couple of feet behind me.
 The fan also allows me to stalk a bird that hangs up, holding it in front of me where I can close the distance between the bird and I, to get close enough for a shot.
 I wouldn’t recommend using a fan, on public ground as you wouldn’t want to be mistaken for a gobbler and get a load of shot in your face.
 When I do get in range for a head shot, , I use a load that puts the bird down, relying on Hornady’s 12-gauge 3” # 6 shot, 1 ½ ounce, 4 Dr E.Q. Nickel Plated Turkey loads using it with a modified choke.
 This load travels at 1,300 feet per second, packing a wallop and if you aim just below the birds head in the neck area, you’ll have a super pattern putting the # 6 BB’s in the neck and head region.
 One thing you don’t want to do is shoot at the gobbler’s body as the birds have a lot of feathers which can absorb the shot and not reaching the vital organs, only wounding the bird that will run off and eventually die.
 Nothing gets my blood flowing more than an early morning gobble on opening day, and the sight of a full strutting gobbler coming my way, it’s been that way for me for over 35 years and will happen each and every opening day from this season forward.
 Good luck this spring, and please try to bring a youngster out in the field with you as they’re our hunting future and a way you can pass on our hunting heritage.

He’s a thinker, yes, but he’s also one heck of a player.
 “He’s a marked man,” Lee said. “When you lead the country in three-point shooting, people are going to take that away.”
 Yes, Hagedorn is averaging 18.1 points per game for the Coyotes this season, but to really appreciate the season he’s having, a deep dive is required.
 Let’s examine.
 He’s shooting 54 percent overall from the floor, but has made 52 percent of his three-point attempts. Hagedorn is not a big man who rarely shoots from deep, no, he frequently launches from deep.
 In fact, he’s just shy of qualifying for the Division I lead in three-point percentage. Yes, the top three-point shooter in the country is a 6-foot-10 post.
 And for good measure, Hagedorn is shooting 82 percent at the free throw line.
 That percentage line of 54-52-82 is mind-boggling.
 “I don’t think there’s another player in the country doing that,” Lee said.
 But there’s more.
 “You could make an argument he’s the most efficient offensive player in the country,” Lee said.
 Hagedorn has always been a dangerous three-pointer shooter (and not just for someone his size), but what he’s doing this season has attracted more attention from opposing defenses.
 He’s typing guarded by a ‘four,’ and his number of looks have decreased.
 “It’s not a secret,” Lee said. “Then they take their chances with him in the post.”
 You can’t be a secret when you’ve done what Hagedorn has done in his career in Vermillion.
 He’s scored 1,208 points, grabbed 532 rebounds, made 43 percent of his three- point attempts and has guided USD back to the Summit League tournament.
 The third-seeded Coyotes (20-11) open the tournament Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. against North Dakota at the Premier Center in Sioux Falls.
 It’s the first step toward what Hagedorn is a Summit League championship — and trip to the NCAA Tournament — in his final season.
 All these years later from a middle school tournament title in Sioux Falls.
 “I remember that moment specifically, when I really fell in love with basketball,” Hagedorn said. “I knew I was going to put all my heart and soul into it.
 “That really drove me throughout my career.”

In fact, it’s often gone the other way for Hagedorn, a 6-foot-10 senior forward for the University of South Dakota men’s basketball team.
 A lifelong hoops junkie and son of a basketball official, he’s an admitted over-thinker.
 “Some people have told me it’s a burden and a blessing,” Hagedorn said this week, with a smile.
 With the good comes, at times, the bad.
 On the one hand, Hagedorn — who hails from Norfolk, Nebraska — knows the game so well that he’s simultaneous a coach and an official on the floor. Yet, on the other hand, that can be a detriment.
 “The most repeated thing that coaches have told me is, ‘Stop thinking, just play,’” Hagedorn said.
 Sometimes that’s easier said than done.
 Especially when you spent many nights of your childhood in a gym.
 From a young age, he would travel the region with his father, Randy, who would officiate college basketball games — Hagedorn jokes that he’s been to every college arena within a 3-4 hour radius.
 Wayne State College was a place Hagedorn remembers most, he said. He’d tag along on the short drive with his father and the other officials to Wayne, and would get up shots in the auxiliary gym before his father’s game started.
 He’d then sit there and watch.
 He’d spend time in the officials’ room during halftime.
 He’d ride back with them, hearing the way they described their game.
 “Pretty much everything I know about basketball is from my dad,” Hagedorn said.
 “Maybe not everything,” he added, with a chuckle.
 As youth basketball became high school basketball and eventually Division I basketball, Hagedorn’s knowledge of the game continued to grow. It’s to the point now that people joke that he sees the game as an official.
 “Sometimes your greatest strength is your greatest weakness, and he does think,” USD head coach Todd Lee said, with a smile.
 “Sometimes you can see his mind working.”
 There’s an easy solution, though: Just ask Hagedorn what’s going through his mind.
 There’s far more to the Hagedorn story, though.

"The Court cannot reconcile certain public representations made by Attorney General Barr with the findings in the Mueller Report," Walton wrote in his opinion. "The inconsistencies between Attorney General Barr's statements, made at a time when the public did not have access to the redacted version of the Mueller Report to assess the veracity of his statements, and portions of the redacted version of the Mueller Report that conflict with those statements cause the Court to seriously question whether Attorney General Barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the Mueller Report in favor of President Trump despite certain findings in the redacted version of the Mueller Report to the contrary."

 Graham pledges money for port
 Gov. Bob Graham says he’ll try to persuade state legislators to cough up a $36.5 million sweetener for Pensacola’s entry in the competition for a Navy flotilla, including a battleship. The proposal calls for $35 million to dredge the harbor at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, where warships would be docked, $250,000 for environmental studies, $250,000 for preliminary engineering and $1 million to relocate some historic airplane hangars at the air station to make way for the ships. Six other Gulf Coast counties in the running are expected to offer similar enticements. The reward is an annual payroll estimated at about $60 million and $100 million in new construction. Graham said he would meet with legislative leaders about funding between now and March 18. — Jackson County Floridan, Friday, March 8, 1985

MINNEAPOLIS — Apartment developers in the Twin Cities are accustomed to ginning up out-of-the-box amenities aimed at wooing renters and setting themselves apart in an increasingly competitive market. That includes decked- out dog spas, catering kitchens and refrigerated drop boxes for package delivery.
 Twin Cities-based Newport Midwest hopes to offer something unique in this market with its plans for Agra, an income-restricted 171-unit rental building in Minneapolis that will include a 5,000-square-foot hydroponic greenhouse to be run by a third-party operator who will return 40% of its harvest to residents and the neighborhood.
 Claire VanderEyk, senior development associate at Newport Midwest, an affiliate of California-based Newport Partners, said the idea was driven by a need to innovate and a desire to “create what we know how to do best, and take it a step forward.”
 Last year the company opened Hook & Ladder in northeast Minneapolis, which is being called the first apartment building in the state built to Passive House Institute U.S. standards for energy efficiency.
 The company took control of the site in November. In January, VanderEyk and nearly a half-dozen associates, including a team of designers from Collage Architects, gathered in a conference room to discuss ways of reducing the limitations of the small site, which is now home to a shuttered Perkins restaurant.
 Key questions were how to maximize the density of the planned seven-story building while including features that set the building apart and bolster the sense of community in Seward, a neighborhood that already has several community-minded businesses, including the Seward Community Co-op.
 Pete Keely, president of Collage, initially suggested a garden.
 “Then I built off that idea,” VanderEyk said.
 In income-restricted buildings, many residents are over-scheduled and already struggling to make ends meet, so the group expressed concern about creating what could become just another obligation for residents.
 “But we wanted to do it in a big way,” she said. “The last thing I wanted to do was put more pressure on them to create gardens and maintain them.”
 And then there was the issue of the small site. A large garden would mean a smaller building footprint, so the group moved the garden to the roof. VanderEyk said she was inspired by Arbor House, an affordable project in the Bronx that also uses energy from the sun to grow vegetables in water rather than soil.
 She started consulting with the team on that project to learn more about how it works. To avoid burdening residents and to make good on the promise to help supply residents and neighbors with produce, they decided the farm would be run by a third-party operator. They have been consulting with Matt Weed of Weed’s Greens in Mendota Heights, who is also the preferred operator. That selection won’t be made until later in the municipal approvals process, which has just begun.
 VanderEyk said that for income-restricted buildings that are in high demand, market differentiation isn’t the top priority.
 “It starts with the fact that we want to approach development in a different way,” she said. “Leasing isn’t necessarily a big challenge, but access to funding is an issue.”
 She said that with funding getting more competitive by the day, innovative features can help developers gain a competitive edge with the many organizations and agencies that help finance such projects.
 She’s submitting funding applications now and hopes to close on the site in early 2021.
 Mary Bujold, president of Maxfield Research, a Twin Cities market-research company, said the rooftop farm concept is the first of its kind in the Twin Cities. But it’s happening beyond the Midwest.
 “This makes so much sense,” Bujold said. “We definitely need to consider more sites for urban farming.”

But Forest Park has been nearly just as hot, winning 15 of its last 16 games — the lone loss coming against Lovejoy in overtime of the Region 4-6A championship game — and beating its playoff adversaries by an average of 26 points.
 “They’re a team with a lot of size, they have a lot of depth within the team,” said Glynn Academy girls head coach Sharnesha Smith. “They want to pressure you a lot, just one of those teams that play like most Atlanta teams do.
 “They have a few pieces, a lot of kids that do a lot of things. They’re pretty much a good, well-rounded team.”
 Forest Park has seven players on its roster that have played at least 28 of its 32 games and averaged five points per game or more, and an eighth that was just shy of that mark at 4.8. By comparison, Glynn Academy has just three players averaging more than five points — Zoesha Smith, Talia Hamilton, and La’Trinity Best.
 However, for the depth the Panthers deploy, there is still a clear alpha in their offensive ecosystem: Sania Feagin. The 6-foot-4 junior averages 17.2 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 2.5 assists while providing 3.0 steals and 3.6 blocks per game on the defensive end.
 “My team has to realize that we have to limit her touches as much as possible,” Coach Smith said. “Good players, you won’t be able to completely stop them, but you just have to limit what they do. If you limit what she does, then you can’t let people around her have a career night.”

Thus far, there’s been no indication of any widespread cancellations of worship services. However, Jamie Aten, a psychologist who is executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, said it would be wise for faith leaders to start preparing for that eventuality.
 “Some faith communities already stream services or communicate with each other over social media,” Aten noted. “Though there aren’t any perfect solutions and such discussions can be difficult to have, it’s better to have them now and not later.”
 Among the Catholic bishops ordering changes was Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, whose region is the worst hit in the U.S. The Washington state health department has confirmed more than 30 cases of the coronavirus in the Seattle area, and at least 10 deaths.
 In a letter to parish leaders, Etienne said wine should not be distributed during Communion until further notice, and church-goers should receive the Communion wafer in their hand, not on their tongue.
 The archbishop urged Catholics to stay home from Mass if they are sick; to practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing; and to avoid hand-to- hand contact during moments in the church service when churchgoers traditionally shake hands with those near them in the pews.
 Many other dioceses around the U.S. are taking similar steps — even in areas such as Pittsburgh where no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed. Among the many dioceses and archdioceses making the changes were those in Atlanta, Boston, Joliet, Illinois, San Antonio and Newark and Paterson, New Jersey.
 In Chicago, the Catholic archdiocese not only suspended the serving of Communion wine from a chalice, it also ordered priests, deacons and other personnel to wash their hands before Mass and use an alcohol based anti- bacterial solution before and after distributing Communion.
 “Assure the faithful that if they are sick or are experiencing symptoms of sickness, they are not obliged to attend Mass, and even that out of charity they ought not to attend,” the archdiocese told its priests.
 Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was among the bishops ordering that the Communion wafer be placed in the recipient’s hand, not on the tongue, for the time being.
 “How we receive, while very personal to the individual communicant, is not crucial,” Wester wrote on the diocese website. “Receiving Communion in the hand is every bit as respectful as receiving on the tongue.”
 The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has shared with its member bishops some suggested steps that could be taken in response to the outbreak, but it has left it up to individual bishops to decide if and how to implement those steps. Some dioceses said they would leave some decisions to the discretion of their parish priests.
 The virus outbreak was prompting changes in many other faiths as well — in the U.S. and around the world.
 Saudi Arabia on Wednesday banned its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, while Iran canceled Friday prayers in major cities.
 Several imams in the U.S. advised Muslim worshippers that it is religiously permissible to pray at home rather than attend Friday group prayers, which are generally considered obligatory for adult men.
 After the prayers, Muslim congregants typically greet one another with hugs, handshakes and cheek kisses. Now, some mosque leaders are halting the custom of shaking the imam’s hand after prayer and are advising worshippers to find alternative greetings.
 “For the time being, it may be worth avoiding touch and switching to a hand on the heart, a respectful nod, and a warm smile,” Omar Ricci, spokesman of the Islamic Center of Southern California, wrote in an email to congregants.

With no bridges or crossings within miles, and the sun starting to come up, we didn’t have time to go around and he only mean for us to get across the swollen river.
 The bank to bank rushing water gave us no place to wade across; our only choice was to cross on a wobbly woven wire fence.
 Because of the high water, the fence was not only wobbly, it had caught all the trash washing downriver, giving the current a lot of stuff to pound against and not the safest way to get to the birds.
 I moved up on the fence first to see if it would hold us, which wasn’t real solid, but tight enough to hold us and all of our equipment, with Chuck and the camera following up behind me, once he was sure I hadn’t tumbled into the river
 By the time, I crossed; the birds were out of the tree and moving east, with one mature gobbler, a jake and a hen working away from their homestead.
 As I looked back towards Chuck, who was still making his way across the river, I told him that he needed to hurry or the birds would be gone.
 Reaching my side of the river, I took the camera from him and slid up along the bank and started calling, hoping to get the last three birds attention.
 Note: I was younger then and asked if I’d cross a fenced during high water, my answer would be “No Way, Positively NOT.”
 Chuck was just getting into position as the gobbler spun around and started working towards us, with the jake and hen in tow.
 The gobbler was hot, gobbling his head off while his head starting changing colors from white to blue to red as it frantically searched for the gobbler that had invaded his territory, cutting the distance between myself and the abandon homestead very quickly.
 The gobbler wasn’t wasting any time and if Chuck didn’t get set up soon, we wouldn’t get it on camera.
 I whispered to him that the bird was coming on quickly and he needed to get the camera up and film.
 He said he had to shoot through a downed fence and didn’t know how it would work, I said zoom out and get the footage as if he didn’t this red headed hot gobbler would be on top of us and too close to film.
 Chuck gave me the thumbs up as the gobbler worked towards me, reaching the roost tree at about 30 yards, and not seeing the intruder, it was getting nervous.
 Using my diaphragm call, I gave a warning putt, with the gobbler raising his red noggin high to try and locate the danger, giving me a perfect aiming point.
 My twelve gauged barked, with the gobbler going down hard, flopping all over the ground, where the young jake with him, thought this would be the perfect opportunity for it to get a few licks in on the tom that had beaten it up earlier.
 As I ran to the gobbler, the jake just wasn’t going to give up and was on top of the bird, pounding it.
 I literally had to boot the jake off the gobbler, and he kept coming back, which made for some good footage.
 When I raised the bird, I let Chuck know that it had three beards coming out of its chest and as I showed it to Chuck, his comment was, “Sure when you saw that tripled beard, you didn’t care if I was set up and got the footage, you just wanted to tag the gobbler.”
 I had one heck of a time convincing him that hadn’t seen the gobbler’s beard before I shot it and if you’d ask him today about it, I’m sure he’d come up with the same story.
 Now, each time I walk through my offices and glance up at that bird hanging on the wall, I remember how dangerous it was to cross on that wobbly wire and the trash hung up on it during high water, the way the gobbler acted and of course Chuck’s comments.
 As this spring approaches, I’m looking forward to another turkey season, I have several places spotted where the birds are roosting, strutting and gobbling, so this week, I’ll get on the phone and lock things in.
 Once I’ve my land lined up, I’ll begin to get my gear ready, which includes head to toe camo, including cap, facemask, shirt, sweatshirt, jeans, brown socks and a turkey vest to carry all my gear which includes a number of calls including diaphragms, slates, box, push button and shock calls, shells, lightweight stick in the ground blind, binoculars, gobbler fan, decoys, rain gear, then test firing my shotgun to check the pattern and finally cleaning my shotgun.
