The EFF leader Julius Malema was left with egg shells in his face after realising that he backed a dead horse. Malema did not do a fact finding enquiry before he issued puke on Zimbabwe.      Julius Malema did not read through the article by George Shire stating facts about Hopewell Chin'ono if he had read through it he would be retreating in his cuckoo.      George Shire in his article Simple Facts made perfect sense which Malema need to see. If one understands who is Hopewell Chin'ono then this whole issue will make sense.      Hopewell Rugoho-Chin'ono is a Harvard University-trained Zimbabwean journalist. He has won numerous awards in journalism and has worked in both print and broadcasting journalism. He is currently employed by the ITV      Hopewell wrote an article against Robert Mugabe which made him a darling of the USA and became the USA government contact point on Zimbabwe. He embraced the YSA foreign policy on Zimbabwe and Chin'ono's writings assisted the USA to make decisions on Zimbabwe. Hopewell's rise to fame, which earned him accolades and his ‘made in the US' point of self identification came about from writing crap about Robert Mugabe to the satisfaction of the Western gaze on Zimbabwe.  The decisions to sanction Zimbabwe by the USA largely was based on the articles by Chin'ono. The label ‘international repute' is about how hope made negative opinion that and nothing more. He is America"s reputed point of contact and his opinion on Zimbabwe and it leaders has been given more weight by the Americans. He is not A journalist  who covers‘international news' in the true meaning of ‘international'.  He is an opinion writer but doing it for one particular country which is the USA. This is the reason why Hopewell is made an instant hero by America and the more reason why it is America which is pushing other countries to act against Zimbabwe. In other words, Chin'ono manages to attract world class attention even if he is silent. George Shire made a very important observation when he said "Hopewell's output is 'Harare News' and Harare is not Zimbabwe, the continent, let alone international. My political beef with him is with his enthusiasm for American foreign policy on Zimbabwe."      Hopewell represents the colonial mindset and in his mind a Zimbabwean can never run a country. He sees nothing wrong with Pompeo's idea of ‘reforms' which would be tantamount to rewriting the Zimbabwean constitution and goes beyond the compensation of the developments white farmers made to the land, and wants to see all the land ‘returned' to white farmers and to a land distribution map of the 1980's.  Chin"ono works to please his paymasters who wish him to advance the narative that the only solution to Zimbabwe's problems is when the land is given back to the white men. That is simply unacceptable. When it comes to ZIDERA Chin'ono agreed with America and he celebrated the sanctions on Zimbabwe. Hopewell speaks from the same script as the USA and this has made him a darling of the States. He has worked against anything Zimbabwean for a long time. Regardless of his treasonous adventures he was not arrested for this. He then obviously got engaged with ITV as a cover up job yet he was in a job on the American ticket.   But these are not the reasons he has been arrested for. It is a straightforward lie that Hopewell is the only investigative journalist who stepped on anybody's toes.  Nor is he the only journalist journalist who has brought up cases of corruption.      It is very true that there are a lot of corruption cases in the country. To that end Zimbabwean government has made public declarations of war against corruption.  So Chin"ono is not the only journalist who has written about corruption. It should be known that all his disclosures were not the result of investigative journalism. Chin'ono was simply given the information. He fed them on his Twitter and thus did not write news on the corruption instead he simply sent a report of what he was told to his paymasters.      There are many journalists in Zimbabwe from hostile and friendly papers  who have written  about corruption and they have not been arrested or threatened. Hopewell Chin'ono has behaved like a demi god in that he accused many people without evidence. He has taken after his bosses in America who accuse everybody on earth except themselves. Chin'ono has been accused by many for smearing people without providing the evidence to back the claims he makes or giving those people the right of reply before his sensational so called whistleblowing. His style of destroying people's characters reputations lives and credibility is not the reason of his arrest.   So the narrative which is being thrown around about Chinono is wrong. He is not being persecuted for exposing corruption. One can as himself since when did America become interested in corruption in Zimbabwe to such an extent that they put their weight towards exposing it.  We need to look beyond the print.   After exposing the suspected corruption the government investigated and the law is taking its course.  The truth of the matter is that Hopewell was given information about the PPEs by the senior Civil Servant who was having her fight with the minister of Health.      This played in the hands of Chin'ono and his paymasters. He then was connected to the investigators in Zimbabwe Anti Corruption Commission. These investigators have worked closely with the former minister of Information Jonathan Moyo. They have kept that closeness hence Jonathan Moyo was ahead of all current information in the Draxegate. Moyo then formed a stronger link with Chinono remember they had worked together before.   So Moyo and Chin'ono shared the notes thats why their Twitts were verbatim.   When Chin'ono realised that he has been taken seriously in his whistleblowing escapade he moved away from being an investigative journalist to a political activist.      There is nothing wrong for Chin'ono to front a course he believes in only that he is fronting a course which is not his. He is simply being an American agent. Still he was not arrested for that.   Chin'ono entangled himself in an illegality disguised as  whistle blowing.   He incited people to come together and demonstrate against a government which was constitutionally elected.   Chin'ono originated a hush tag which says "ZANU PF MUST GO" that point he became a political activist. Then he goes on to encourage people to congregate against the COVID laws. This was a crime.  After his arrest he refused to give a promise that he will not break the law until the case is over. He could not give that assurance and the court had no choice but to keep him safe in the holding cells. This was for his own safety and the safety of the nation.      George Shire observed in his article that "His electronic fingerprints were all over the place in self styling himself as agent provocateur and allowed his public persona to be seen as somebody inciting others to commit violence. That is why he is in trouble."

As a devout Christian, there is one thing that I have never been able to wrap my mind around - that is, can most Christians and Church leaders in Zimbabwe honestly tell me that they can not see the barbarous evil being perpetrated by the country's ruling elite on a largely defenceless innocent population, whose only desire is to live an oppression-free prosperous life, where every citizen is accorded their God-given dignity and respect, equitably enjoy the abundant wealth that Jehovah bestowed on this great nation and its people, as well as those entrusted with leadership being held accountable for their deeds?      As Christians, can we seriously tell the millions of Zimbabweans - obviously, the vast majority of them being Christians, as over ninety percent of the population confess to be of this faith - who have been sadistically reduced to miserable paupers, who have to survive on less than one United States dollar (USD) a day, and forced to survive on food handouts - whilst, the small elite opportunistic ruling clique live lavishly, as a result of the mass looting of national resources that God, by His abundant wealth of grace, blessed us with, so that each and every citizen may benefit - that we can not see all this, or do not care?      What do we tell those hard-working men and women (our parents and grandparents), who sacrificed their entire lives, with their sweat and tears, in an effort to develop this beautiful country into a prosperous paradise for everyone - yet, lost all their pensions, insurance policies, and life savings, which cruelly vanished into thin air, as a direct consequence of the corrupt and warped selfish government economic policies that merely sought to serve those in power, at the expense of the majority?      Who today, can not even afford a ten kilogram bag of mealie meal - let alone, a decent meal, critical medication (as they are now elderly, and prone to various ailments), and other necessities - in spite of having diligently prepared for their retirement, but have been turned into beggars by a heartless regime.      What are we to say to the countless wives, husbands, children, and parents of those gallant human rights and political activists who disappeared without a trace (and still have not been accounted for), whilst numerous ordinary citizens, investigative journalists, lawyers, labor and social justice defenders have been viciously butchered, abducted, tortured, sexually abused, beaten up, or arrested on questionable charges - merely for doing what we, as the Sons and Daughters of the Almighty Jehovah, and His representatives in this world, are expected to do...that is, holding those placed in positions of authority, on behalf of God, to account for their actions and decisions?      Are we, seriously, going to tell them that we never saw what was taking place? Or, are we going to say that we were too afraid to stand up, or speak out? Or, are we going to wash our hands, as Pontius Pilate, and claim that these abominable acts by the ruling establishment have nothing to do with us?      Nothing to do with us? Afraid of the Devil, and his workers of iniquity?      Surely, why would we even believe that? How can we even fathom such evil thoughts? Are we not ashamed?      As a beloved wise cousin of mine so aptly put it this morning - which inspired me to write this article - "Christians are more afraid of death than God". Such, unadulterated truth, which is so painful that it immediately moved me to write, even though I had absolutely no plan of doing so today.      As Christians we need to ask ourselves these pertinent questions: Was Moses not afraid of death when he confronted the ruthless Egyptian Pharaoh, demanding him to let God's people go? Possibly he was, as he was the same Moses who had fled his most comfortable and privileged royal life in Egypt, after killing one of its soldiers, only to end up living in exile for forty years.

He may not have been in place to see his empire collapse but the way in which Arsenal have been reformed in the image that Gazidis was so keen to move them away from cannot have gone unnoticed by their former chief executive.


  Sanllehi's departure has brought with a restructuring that places a man with an eye for the purse strings and commercial concerns at the top of the organisational chart, just as Gazidis was. Vinai Venkatesham has spoken of his desire to communicate more with supporters but even he would acknowledge that the cultural leader at Arsenal is once more the man who picks the starting XI.


  For this to be a true tragedy it is not just that Gazidis has to be unable to avoid his own fate but that he has to set the wheels in motion for it to become reality, something he did when he made his move to AC Milan.

If we overindulge in something – even if we have just one too many – it instantly loses its value, and we start to regret, and even resent the thing that made us feel that way. This also applies to telly (See? We got there eventually). Too much of a good thing can ruin said good thing. The old showbiz adage ‘always leave ‘em wanting more’ still rings true. TV shows at the peak of their power need to know when to call it a day, and then resist the temptation of giving in to popular demand and coming back. If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that popular demand is stupid. Ignore popular demand at all costs.

The first 15 Kansas City Royals games were ugly to watch, but bad baseball is better than no baseball.


   


  It does look as if the young players will be able to get valuable experience, which is a good nod to the future. Some of the young pitchers in particular seem to have a lot of potential. It is important to play and pitch the young players and not worry about the 2020 playoffs.


   


  It hurt the team in the outfield and offensively with the absence of Hunter Dozier due to COVID-19. Without him, Franchy Cordero (now out on the injured list) hit .154, Alex Gordon is under .200 and Bubba Starling was at .211 and they have maybe hit a dozen balls hard between them. Brett Phillips is the only outfielder that has shown any offensive success.


   


  Whit Merrifield brings the outfield's offense up a notch when he is playing the outfield. Merrifield has shown pop with the bat and is the best all-around player on the team.


   


  Salvador Perez is swinging the bat very well after coming off a year and a half layoff. He has to stay in the lineup all the time, so he needs to learn how to play first base.


   


  Jorge Soler is the perfect major league DH. He is the first big time power hitter the Royals have had who can change the result of any game with one swing of the bat. He will always be a high home run and RBI guy and if he can continue to hit around .265 for an average, the Royals need to keep him around.


   


  The combination of Ryan O'Hearn and Ryan McBroom at first base may end up as a good possibility of two guys who can play a platoon role and add an effective bat off the bench. Nicky Lopez started off both offensively and defensively terribly slow both but has improved over the past couple of weeks. He needs to play this year to see if he can be an everyday major league second baseman.


   


  The hardest guy to figure out on the entire team is shortstop Adalberto Mondesi. He is a five-tool player who everyone says is special, but he has struggled at the plate and in the field all year. He is hitting .262 and when he does get on, he can change the entire game plan with his outstanding speed. He is second on the team in strikeouts and his defense has been average at best, especially on the route plays and throws. Every year Mondesi is supposed to be a breakthrough player. He needs to stay in the lineup every game this year to prove he is the franchise shortstop.


   


  The addition of Maikel Franco at third base has proven to be a solid move. He is hitting well and among the American League leaders in extra-base hits. He is solid at third and looks like he will provide much needed power in the lineup.


   


  The Royals organization has invested most of their drafting resources into young pitchers, which is great. I hope they will continue to let those young arms get the experience they need throughout the 2020 season. Brady Singer, Gabe Speier, Tyler Zuber and Kris Bubic should get a lot of innings in order to be ready for a true big-league season when that time comes.


   


  Veterans Danny Duffy and Ian Kennedy have been very solid and have provided good leadership for the young pitchers. Greg Holland has helped the bullpen with his experience. The loss of both Brad Keller and Jakob Junis at the beginning of the season probably cost the team 2-4 wins. Both of these guys can pitch.


   


  It looks like Trevor Rosenthal has found his groove again as a closer. The bullpen has used many arms to try to determine who can be counted on in the future.


   


  The organization is going to have to develop some younger players in everyday positions in order to turn the corner to become playoff caliber. Gordon is at the end of the road. Starling struggles to hit. Lopez has to be more consistent. Mondesi needs to become the major league player he was expected to be. At least they are having a season!

Along with the positivity rate, the benchmarks also suggest a two-week decline in the number of cases or new case rates below 100 per 100,000 and a two-week period in which hospital visits for illness related to the virus be below 10 percent.


  Once Mesa meets those benchmarks, the district will then notify families and teachers to begin a two-week transition period to return to in-person learning, a decision that board members did not agree upon.


  “Waiting two weeks to show that we can hold a benchmark and then two more weeks to get everybody ready is a real disservice to our families,” Richardson said. “If we follow that kind of timeline, we for sure won’t be in school the first quarter.


  “My goal is to get our kids, in some form, back on campus and in front of a teacher as quickly as we can.”


  Board President Elaine Miner said she was “uncomfortable” with how the resolution was worded, as it signals the benchmarks are no longer recommendations, but something everyone in the district will be forced to comply with.


  The same resolution has been passed unanimously by the Tempe Union High School and Kyrene school district governing boards while Gilbert Public Schools, Higley Unified and Chandler Unified boards have not brought it up for discussion.


  “I feel like there are so many layers that we have put to determine whether we can go back to school or not, that instead of giving our families hope, and the feeling that we are trying to work with them, it is more discouraging,” Miner said. “I could not recommend or vote on this kind of a resolution.


  “To me, the resolution should be a piece of communication to our families that we hear you, we are not abandoning you and we are doing everything within our power to get your children back in school because we know that is the best place for them to be. I feel like there is such high standard out there that it’s almost like putting a carrot out there and saying, ‘whoops, not yet,’” Miner added.


  Part of the resolution that drew criticism from the board also states that if metrics were not met by Sept. 22, the board would meet to re-evaluate the plan to move forward with in-person learning.


  “I am not comfortable with the document because I think it is signing and adhering to some of the gray areas,” board member Kiana Sears said, adding she feels there needs to be a clearer path by the board to decide whether the state’s benchmarks will in fact be used to determine when Mesa schools open.


  “Putting this in a resolution is problematic for me. I think signing this document is saying this is what we are in agreement with.”


  The board received more than 430 comments from both teachers and parents, most of which centered around the desire to have kids in classrooms as soon as possible, according to the district’s Director of Communications and Marketing Helen Hollands.


  A majority of those comments centered around the academic and social and emotional well-being of students. Hollands said other comments revolve heavily around families’ discontent with the remote environment, including too much screen time for younger children and the overall frustration with technology.


  Some comments expressed gratitude for the district ensuring safety before opening schools, though Hollands said those were “few and far between.”


  Fourlis said all public comments will be taken into account as her team and the governing board makes improvements in the district’s model for a return to in-person learning.


  “I think it will be important that not only the governing board has access to this information but so does our superintendency team,” Fourlis said. “We will take a look at those as we are making improvements in our model and building the details around modified in-person that we will take this information as well.


  “I want to make sure our public understands that is feedback not just to the governing board but that we will be paying attention to that inside of Mesa Public Schools as well.”

The telco, alongside co-bidder M1, as well as Singtel in April secured licences to deploy nationwide 5G networks in Singapore, while TPG Telecom failed in its bid to do so, but was awarded frequency spectrum in the millimetre wave band, enabling it to roll out localised 5G networks. The Australian telco, and other mobile virtual network operators, would have to negotiate wholesale service agreements with Singtel or M1 and StarHub to tap their respective 5G networks, in order to offer retail 5G services to end- users.


  StarHub's announcement Monday meant its customers would be amongst the first to experience 5G connectivity, if they owned compatible devices currently available in the market including Huawei P40 Pro+ 5G and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G.


  The telco, which was working with Nokia as its 5G technology partner, said its 5G signals currently were live on 2100MHz spectrum on a non-standalone architecture.


  StarHub said its standalone 5G network, running on 3.5GHz spectrum, would be up and running by mid-2021. Its chief of consumer business Johan Buse said: "Just as how steam, electricity, and electronics have enriched our lives, the technology revolution of our era -- 5G -- will usher in unprecedented speed, simplicity, and instantaneity, changing the way we work, play, browse, game, watch, and create."

Pakistan’s Army chief was visiting Saudi Arabia on Monday in an effort to ease a row between the two countries over policy towards Kashmir.


  The argument, brought on by Pakistani demands for Saudi Arabia to take a firmer line against India’s behaviour in Kashmir, has threatened Riyadh’s financial lifeline to Islamabad.


  General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s visit was “primarily military-affairs oriented,” the Pakistani Army spokesman said. But Pakistani military and government officials said Gen. Bajwa would try to calm a situation that if not reversed could badly hurt Pakistan’s central bank foreign reserves.


  A traditional ally, Saudi Arabia gave Pakistan a $3 billion loan and $3.2 billion oil credit facility to help its balance of payments crisis in late 2018.


  Irked by Islamabad’s demands for Riyadh to convene a high-level meeting to highlight India’s alleged human rights violations in Kashmir, Saudi Arabia has forced Pakistan to pay back $1 billion early and is demanding another $1 billion of the loan. Riyadh has also not responded to Pakistani requests to extend the oil facility, military and finance ministry officials have told Reuters.


  “I think our case is to convince them that there’s no foreign policy shift,” a senior Pakistani military official said.


  The Saudi-led Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) has only held low-level meetings over Kashmir despite Islamabad’s demands.


  Analysts say Saudi Arabia does not want risk its business interests in India for supporting Pakistan over Kashmir. Riyadh might also have reservations over its foe Iran's possible inclusion in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, they said.


  Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said last week that if Saudi Arabia did not convene a meeting on Kashmir, then Pakistan might call one involving Islamic countries that supported it on the issue.


  Last year Islamabad withdrew from a forum of Muslim nations at the last minute on the insistence of Riyadh, which saw the gathering as an attempt to challenge Saudi's OIC leadership.


  Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi, an influential Pakistani cleric, who went to Riyadh ahead of the general's visit, was optimistic, saying Saudi King Salman bib Abdul Aziz and Crown Price Mohammad bin Salman have a long history of good relations with Pakistan.


  “I don't think things are so bad that as to say we are at daggers drawn,” he told _Reuters_.

Guvamatanga the government's paymaster has been in the eye of a storm after approving dubious payments running into millions of dollars to Drax International, a company linked to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's twin sons Collins and Shaun. The company was awarded tenders worth over US$60 million to supply drugs and medical devices to the health ministry without going to tender.      Obadiah Moyo was arrested and sacked as health minister over the scandal exposed by ZimLive. Four executives of the state-owned drugs firm NatPharm were also arrested, but no action was taken against Guvamatanga who maintains that the task of doing due diligence on suppliers fell on the health ministry.      Guvamatanga earlier this year reportedly paid US$50,000 cash for a kitchen suite although like all Zimbabwean public servants he is paid in the worthless local currency.      Doctors and nurses are on strike at public hospitals where most Zimbabweans end up if they develop complications from the coronavirus but Guvamatanga had no such problems after being treated at the Rock Foundation Medical Centre in Mt Pleasant which was recently acquired by the controversial petroleum tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei.      The facility, formerly owned by jailed child rapist Munyaradzi Kereke, was renovated to the tune of US$3 million and is reserved for the ruling political and military elites.

Sunday was supposed to be Rob’s day. He would get what should be his ... respect and treatment like a golfing god.


  But then the golf started Sunday and it wasn’t what a lot of Rob fans hoped for.


  Unlike the first three days, Rob never got any momentum. He wasn’t doing badly, in fact saving a few pars and tapping in a par-5 birdie, but that’s not going to win on the PGA Tour.


  The “kids” are ridiculous. They all look about 25 years old, chiseled, cocky and 315-yard driving machines.


  Rob is different. He’s as quiet as a church mouse. He cracks smiles here and there. But the energy level is not what the Millennials exude.


  But that’s Rob. That’s why we love the guy. He just plays, respects everybody, enjoys himself and gets up and down from anywhere.


  Sunday was a huge disappointment for Rob. He lost a lot on the back nine on Sunday. But it was a huge disappointment for a lot of us, who have followed his every move, through several pro tours, and so many close calls of making it or just missing.


  He needed to finish 1-under over the last three holes and he bogeyed the next hole. I admit I threw a book from my coffee table after his putt fell just short. My bad.


  Despite the bad ending, I’m guessing Rob learned a lot on Sunday — that playing in the final group is hard and pressure-packed, including the press commitments for the leaders.


  I realize it doesn’t look great. Rob is 40. The rest of the PGA Tour is 25 or whatever.


  But I’m not ready to bail on this guy. His performance on Saturday was elite. It was special. It showed us that there is another gear inside Rob’s engine.


  I believe what happened in Greensboro, N.C., might have been what he needed, the experience of being with the best of the best. The next time it happens, and I believe it will, Rob will understand the butterflies better.


  He did earn $104,000 for his troubles, which is a nice number, but really didn’t dull all of our collective pain.


  While a PGA Tour victory wouldn’t define Rob, he really does deserve one some day.


  And we deserve to cheer for and with him when it eventually does happen.

Stock market investors in general don't seem all that concerned about the possibility of Joe Biden winning the White House in November. Stock prices have marched relentlessly higher in recent months, even as the former vice president maintains a lead over President Donald Trump in the polls.


  But investors might want to think hard about the ramifications of a single- party sweep as the election approaches. They also might want to delve deeper into Biden's proposed tax agenda and possible impact on various industries.


  Democratic presidents often are assumed to be less friendly to business and thus not favorable to stock prices. But in reality, stocks typically fare a bit better under Democrats than Republicans, various studies have found, although the results depend on how many elections you analyze.

  Jurrien Timmer, a director in Fidelity's global asset-allocation division, found that stocks did better early in a Republican presidency compared with a Democratic administration in his historical study. But over full four-year terms, the results were basically a dead heat, Timmer wrote in the report.


  Congressional makeup important


  Maybe the bigger question is what happens to Congress. Currently, Democrats appear likely to retain control of the House this fall, with the Senate up for grabs.


  "Stocks have tended to do their best when we have a split Congress," wrote Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. "Markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn't have too much sway."


  Since 1950, the Standard & Poor's 500 index has returned an average 17.2% annually during years of split Congresses, according to LPL Financial. That compares with 13.4% on average when Republicans control both the House and Senate and 10.7% when Democrats are in charge. Timmer found that a Democratic president and divided Congress represents the best outcome for investors, based on the historical record.


  Incidentally, the stock market tends to fare worse in the year or two after an election than during the two years preceding an election - a result on which the various studies tend to agree.


  In the first year after an election, large stocks have returned about 7.9%, according to Timmer's report, rising successively to a 9.1% average gain in the fourth years, which also happen to be election years.


  Biden's impact on industries


  While the overall market might not be affected much by which party takes control of the White House, companies in certain industries could feel the repercussions.


  For example, pharmaceutical companies appear to be lagging because of the possibility of a Biden victory, while various alternative-energy companies are on a roll, wrote Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Asset Management, in a commentary.


  Pharmaceutical makers could be hurt if Biden reinforces the Affordable Care Act to give the federal government more power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.


  "Negotiated pricing would likely dent health-care sector profits because, under the current system, most cost increases are borne by patients and their employers," Ablin said.


  Many health-care stocks have struggled in recent months as a Biden victory has become more likely. "Large pharma has trailed the market since May, about the time when Biden gained a statistical advantage" in the polls, Ablin wrote.


  Biden also supports a new financial-risk fee on megabanks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That, and the possibility of Sen. Elizabeth Warren being named as treasury secretary in a Biden administration, might explain why bank stocks have been lagging lately. The potential for more loan problems amid the coronavirus could be another factor weighing them down.


  Potential boost to green energy


  On the plus side, companies engaged in providing alternative energy could benefit if the Democrats' Green New Deal becomes policy. Biden supports electric vehicles, expanded charging stations and zero-emissions public transportation, Ablin wrote. Stocks including electric-vehicle maker Tesla, Vestas Wind Systems and Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, which makes electricity-generating panels, have outperformed lately, he wrote.


  Traditional oil and gas companies have been reeling from slumping demand triggered by reduced driving and air travel from the pandemic. They could face a further headwind from an antagonistic Biden administration.


  "The presidential hopeful would seek to tax carbon emissions, end new oil and gas leases on federal land, and terminate offshore drilling," Ablin wrote. "Among all the industries, it seems that foreign and domestic fossil-fuel companies would be the most disadvantaged by a Biden presidency."


  Possible income-tax changes ahead


  A Biden victory also might alter the nation's income-tax code, especially if Democrats hang onto the House and wrest control of the Senate, making it more likely he could push his agenda through Congress.


  Biden has proposed raising the top rate for individuals from 37% currently to 39.6%, where it stood prior to tax reform, according to a report from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He also has advocated taxing long- term capital gains as ordinary income for high earners, while subjecting income above $400,000 to Social Security payroll taxes. Currently, taxes to support Social Security are levied on the first $137,700 in income only.


  Upper-income Americans might face another headwind - possible elimination of the "step up" in basis. If that happens, more assets held by wealthy families might be subject to capital-gain taxes at death.


  Conversely, Biden could create some new tax credits for renters and first- time home buyers and, possibly, a more generous credit for children and certain dependents.


  In short, the Biden plan would increase taxes for the top 1% of Americans by between 13% and 18% and by 2% to 6% for those falling in the top one-fifth of household incomes, according to the committee's report. The impact on most other individuals would be minimal.


  More on corporate taxes


  Biden's plan would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% currently and impose minimum rates for domestic and foreign income, said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. A higher corporate rate might take a bite out of profits, although a 28% rate still would be below the 35% corporate levy that applied before reform legislation enacted in 2017.


  Biden's tax plan, if implemented, would "moderately slow the pace of economic growth," the committee predicted.


  One interesting footnote is that higher corporate tax rates don't always hurt stock prices. In fact, since World War II, the federal government boosted corporate income-tax rates on five occasions, yet the S&P 500 index was up 12.9% on average 12 months later, according to Surevest Wealth Management in Phoenix.


  "Most companies do not pay the maximum corporate tax rate; rather, their effective rates are much lower," Surevest explained.


  Besides, many other factors also affect stock prices. Taxes and politics are just two pieces in the puzzle, albeit important ones.

TAUNTON -- Taunton may have had a strong anti-suffrage movement back in 1920, but that wasn't going to stop 91-year-old Jane Colton from registering to vote.


  According to local historian Bill Hanna, Colton was born in New Jersey and had lived through 22 presidencies by the time she was able to vote.


  "She said that she had grown up in a family of staunch Democrats, but over her lifetime had become a solid Republican," he said.


  A report by the Old Colony History Museum states that Colton, a nearly 40-year Taunton resident at the time, walked into City Hall on Aug. 26, 1920, to register to vote and became one of the first women in the city to register.


  Though she had never been active in politics, she was believed at the time to be the oldest woman registering to vote in Massachusetts and possibly anywhere. She told a Taunton Daily Gazette reporter at the time that she hoped her action would provide "an incentive and an inspiration" for younger women.


  "She was one of those people who said she had waited all her life for this," Hanna said.

  Ultimately, Colton cast her vote for Warren G. Harding. Four years later, she was able to vote again for Republican Calvin Coolidge. When she died two years later in 1926, she was the oldest woman and voter in Taunton.


  Hanna said she was prominent enough in the community for the Taunton Daily Gazette to write about her death. According to the OCHM, she is buried in the Highland Cemetery in Norwood.


  But in some ways, Colton was an outlier among women in Taunton. Though there were suffragists at work in Bristol County who had met in Taunton decades before, Katie MacDonald, executive director of the OCHM, said there was an active anti-suffrage group in Taunton at the time.


  "In many cases, people in cities like Taunton, which was an industrial, working-class city -- they tended to be conservative people," he said. "My guess is they were conservative about many things in addition to women's suffrage."


  And this wasn't uncommon in Massachusetts. Though Massachusetts is often thought of as a liberal bastion, Hanna said, the state was slow to support a woman's right to vote, and it wasn't a popular idea. Though the commonwealth was the eighth state to ratify the 19th amendment, women weren't allowed to vote in local school committee elections until the 1880s, whereas most states had allowed this 10 to 20 years prior.


  "There was always the sense that women would vote basically the same way as their husbands," he said. "That's what everybody thought. And it's interesting, too, because at least in the 1920 election, that's what happened."


  Hanna said people also believed women would simply vote as a bleeding heart liberal -- that they were too emotional to vote. But that prediction, he said, did not come true.


  Yet despite the anti-suffrage sentiment in Taunton, Hanna said, during the three-month special registration drives the city held for women to register, 3,766 women registered to vote. Why? Out of respect for the suffragists, he said.


  "They felt that since women's suffrage was here and that it was going to be a fact of life, they had a responsibility to those women who had fought for so long to get it to exercise it," he said.


  Those women were able to be part of the eight million American women who voted for the president for the first time in November 1920, according to the OCHM, after a 100-year battle for their right to vote.

“The manager is helpless if the club don’t back him and go for the likes of Haaland. What a perfect fit he would have been. I’ve seen him for Dortmund and he’s an incredible player at 20. Imagine him in the Man United team, that would be spot on. So they’re not far away, but they have to spend the money and get the right players.

It's a challenge for the President to chose from the dung who to appoint as Ministers. Constitutionally, he has reached the maximum number he can appoint as Ministers outside of Parliament and he is left with no option but to just pick from the junkyard.      Our Cabinet is constituted of recycled dead wood and a few new clueless characters like swimmer Kirsty Coventry. Characters who have a track record of failure and newbies who have nothing to offer make up the Zimbabwean Cabinet including those who follow Western economic policies that are anti-poor like Mtuli Ncube. It is no wonder why the economy is a mess and the people are up in arms against their government. People are hungry, angry and poverty levels are too high for a country not at war. There is lack of skill and tact to combat poverty. The only successful thing our Cabinet does is abuse of office, corruption and giving tenders to funny characters like Chivhayo; appointing connections to boards to milk parastatal such as NSSA whilst the poor pensioners get less than US$10 in monthly allowances. It is a Corrupt Cabinet and will be happy to substantiate my claim if called upon to.      We elect Corrupt Cabinet ministers by default. It is from the Corrupt MPs we elect that Cabinet is chosen from. You were most probably bribed to vote for your MP. We ask our MPs to buy us beer, food, seed and give us some money in exchange for our vote. Those who are poor and/or incorruptible are not voted for regardless of their progressive ideas'. Once your MPs get appointed to Ministerial positions, they must recover their money used during campaigning and buying your vote. They must make more money and enough to buy your vote in the next election. They use corruption to do all that and you make all sorts of noise as if you are not part of the the problem. These are your Ministers, you voted for them and they are Corrupt.

The sixth-seeded Islanders have put Washington within a loss of being eliminated in the first round for the second straight year after hoisting the Cup.


  "Obviously, for us right now it's nothing to lose, right? So we just have to go out there and play," Washington star Alex Ovechkin said. "Don't think about the score in the series."


  Holtby had 32 saves for the third-seeded Capitals, who have to win Game 4 on Tuesday night to extend the best-of-seven series.


  "I know it's a hard situation, but it's not over yet," said Ovechkin, who had one assist and one shot Sunday. "We won the Cup when we were down 2-0 against Columbus, coming back, and we're going to try."


  New York's Anders Lee broke a scoreless tie late in the first period. Evgeny Kuznetsov pulled the Capitals into a tie with a power-play goal early in the second.


  Varlamov stopped 22 shots, including two in overtime when Jakub Vrana had a breakaway shortly before Barzal scored the winner off Jordan Eberle's pass that took advantage of poor defensive positioning.


  "I just should have been sagged off a little bit more to give myself a better chance at the puck," Capitals defenseman John Carlson said.


  The 23-year-old Barzal was thankful the play wasn't called offside.


  "We knew it was tight," he acknowledged. "I run that play a little bit in practice and even in games, try to sneak behind the D, and time it perfectly on the blue line. Great heads-up play by Ebs, great touch on the pass."

Yesterday's (14 August 2020) Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation virtual meeting was an eye-opener, and had one major takeaway for the people of Zimbabwe - the apparent lone and isolated stance by their government that the country was under some so-called 'asymmetric warfare' attack by 'dark forces', both from foreign and local 'perennial detractors'.      What was so encouraging about this 'isolation' was the hope of the possibility that the region had finally woken up to the realization that, this two-decade long cry by Zimbabwe authorities of a concerted attack by Western countries, primarily the United States of America (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and European Union (EU) - using local proxies - was nothing more than a thin veil to justify its relentless ruthless crackdown on any genuine dissent by millions of suffering Zimbabweans, and the opposition.      However, what we witnessed yesterday, based on the statements issued to the public, the only country to even mention the issue of some 'asymmetric warfare' , was Zimbabwe itself, represented by president Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa - as others present, namely Botswana's Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, Zambia's Edgar Lungu, and Executive Secretary Stergomena Taxs, never touched on the matter, but only resorting the usual courtesy pleasantries on how the country had chaired the organ well.      As a grouping of southern African countries tasked with overseeing issues of politics, defence and security in the region, any attack on a fellow neighbour would have surely taken centre stage, and dominated the proceedings - as they sought to find solutions to this obvious threat to peace and security, in both the named country and the region.      The Zimbabwe regime, which has managed to mercilessly ride roughshod over its own people ever since coming into power at the country's independence from Britain in 1980 - characterized by a savage genocide that massacres over 20,000 largely Ndebele speaking civilians, the massacre of hundreds of real and perceived opposition supporters, countless reports of abductions, torture, burning of houses, beating up, sexual abuse, and questionable arrests of ordinary citizens, investigative journalists, lawyers, as well as labour and human rights activists - may have finally been exposed for its shameful lies and sadistic subjugation, which a veteran of the liberation struggle once told me, "would make the Rhodesia Special Branch green with envy".      Of course, it would be grossly naive, if not downright disingenuous, for me to dismiss or rubbish the interference of foreign powers in our internal affairs - as geopolitical history proves the undeniable fact that countries always meddle in others' issues, in order to safeguard, or even impose, their own interests.

I was at the 01027: A Knee Is Not Enough protest in Easthampton on Aug 1. A crowd of 200 is an overestimate.


  I’m sorry, but the victim mentality is overwhelming. The march was greeted with nothing but happy honks and waves from drivers, but the first speaker invoked a negative vibe, insisting that marchers must have seen side-eyes, and maybe someone said something negative — remember that bad racist people are out there and they hate us. She set up that adversarial attitude, that paranoia, from the very first sentence.


  The speakers made demands for things that already are in effect. For example, they were raving about chokeholds when in fact the Easthampton Police Department’s Use of Force by Sworn Personnel document, which is public and online, specifically forbids chokeholds.


  Their entire presentation was very one-sided. Breonna Taylor’s death, for example, was described as an invasion of her home by police who “just started shooting,” without any mention that her boyfriend opened fire on the police first, and nobody was shooting at anyone until he did.


  They were so interested in portraying themselves as victims that I, a former Reuter journalist published on five continents, not to mention in the Advocate and Gazette, was accosted by a random lady who acted more authoritarian than any police officer, despite the fact she has no authority whatsoever.


  She demanded to know who I was, what I was doing there, and if I — with camera in hand! — was a photographer? Oh dear! Make sure you take pictures from the back, she said, don’t show people’s faces! This from a group that invades the home of a Massachusetts representative and calls it “necessary trouble.”


  They’re in a public march down Union Street, but they expect me to humbly lower my eyes and camera for them? Not a chance.


  Their presentation was done in an arrogant tone, as if that tiny, minuscule group were “Kings of Easthampton” and not “voters of Easthampton.” Police lives, the signs said, don’t matter — “Blue Lives Don’t Exist“! “We are the black-and-brown majority!” they proclaim (in Easthampton of all places), and then act as though this dubious claim means that anything spoken by any Black or brown person is therefore correct, laudable, and above all, must be obeyed unquestioningly.


  The police, by the way, were exemplary professionals, they melted away, not one officer in uniform was to be seen, and all the police cars were parked in the back lot, in case the sight of an evil, snarling police vehicle might “trigger” someone.


  I finished my evening with a trip to the underground Hartford reggae scene, where honestly social distancing was better observed than at this demonstration, LOL! And where actual Black and immigrant people are not obsessed with elbow-thrusting grievances and instead are fixated on making money, money to buy school things, money to pay the rent, money to save for the next trip home to Jamaica or Mali or wherever.


  They love the sight of me because I help build the scene, I get on the microphone, I bring ‘hampton folks to Hartford and Hartford folks to Noho (back when the awesome Bishop’s Lounge Thunder Thursdays with Camilo I-Ganic were in full swing.)


  Those actual Black and immigrant people aren’t full of sour hateful negativity. They are intelligently open-minded folks. They don’t run a scene where every point of view is predetermined and any dissent gets you a “home visit” from the BLM Gestapo or a “get him fired” campaign.


  Perhaps A Knee is Not Enough and the Pioneer Valley Worker’s Center might want to reconsider their attitude and tactics.
