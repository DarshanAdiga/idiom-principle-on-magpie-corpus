I pointed out that millions of Americans have marched peacefully since the killing of George Floyd on Memorial Day, and that most are not for the cancel culture or violence against police, but they want racial justice. “I do too,” Trump interrupted.
 Trump also says he has no love for the Confederacy. “I’m against it. It was my opponent. I was born in New York, I’m against it. . . . I am a Yankee. But I also believe in free speech, and I believe in history. You can’t erase history. If you erase it, you’re going to repeat it.” The president’s concern, he said, is that if you give in to the cancel culture, where does it end? “You take out the Confederate? Okay, good. Then they’re going to take out all opposition to the Confederates. I mean, they don’t want George Washington. . . . I’ve seen them rip down statues [of] abolitionists. It will never stop.”
 What about the military posts and bases named for Confederate generals? We don’t have bases named for Benedict Arnold, who was part of our history, because he was a traitor. These Confederate generals were the Benedict Arnolds of their day. “I consider that a very different thing,” Trump said. “The interesting thing, the bases were named after, long after the war. And they were named as a reconciliation to bring our country together. And then, all of a sudden, they cancel them out. Now, I’m not defending or judging any of the names because most of the names — you know Fort Bragg, but nobody knows who General Bragg is. But we won two world wars from these forts. We won two world wars. Is anyone just a little superstitious? We had great success and great luck from all of these places. And now we’re going to all of a sudden change the name? And who are we going to name them after?”
 What about naming them for some of the American heroes Trump named during his remarks at Mount Rushmore? “I would, but I’m not sure that you could get them,” he said. “It won’t be accepted.” Besides, he added, “I think it’s a slippery slope. You’re going to take the name off and then who are we going to name it after? You’re going to end up with a fight, you’re not just going to put a name on it.”
 But if he could control it, would he rename them? “If I could control it . . .” He paused and thought for a moment, then said, “I believe in history. To me, this was Fort Bragg named after somebody as a reconciliation matter. I mean he was a general, he was a tough general, he’s very tough, but this was done for reconciliation. These bases were named to bring the South because it was tremendous animosity from the many years to bring the South . . .” But, I interjected, that’s been accomplished, so the names are not needed anymore. “Yeah, but you could also say then did they go back on the deal?” Besides, the president said, “it’s not going to be easy to find somebody that. . . . I mean, what we’re saying is let’s find somebody who’s universally loved. There is no such person. . . . You couldn’t even name the base [for] George Washington.”
 This is a mistake. If Trump directed the Army to rename bases for the Founding Fathers, he would be striking a blow against the cancel culture, not giving in to it. The left argues that both the Confederacy and the Union were built on slavery. Trump would be in a stronger position to defend the Union if he renamed the bases — and forced his opponents to protest that naming military installations after Washington and Jefferson was inappropriate.
 But Trump is absolutely right to fight back against the cancel culture. And his message will resonate more than many in Washington realize. “It takes guts to say what I say,” he said on Wednesday. “I mean, I understand, I could do it a lot easier, but it would be the wrong thing to do. I could say I’m against everything — ‘I’m against everything, I’m totally in favor of all of the hate.’ — The real hate is not the hate from me. The real hate is the hate from the other side on many of the things that we talk about.”
 “Maybe I’m a voice in the wilderness,” he said, “but most people agree with me. And many won’t say it, and they might not even say it in a poll, but I think they’ll say it in an election.”

I believe from history and my own gut, instinct, that if I go ahead and lay it all out here, what we're really facing, you've got courage and you've got will, and you're gonna get angry and stop caring.

The Bayonne prosecutor said Monguillot was assaulted after he asked four passengers on his No. 810 bus to wear face masks, which are required aboard French public transport because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was insulted, pushed off the bus and violently beaten and kicked in the head, the prosecutor said.


  Four people are in custody.


  “This bus driver was only doing his job,” Darmanin said. "He left his home in the morning and did not come back, leaving a widow and three orphan girls. It is an absolutely odious act."


  France has had over 208,000 confirmed infections and over 30,000 virus- related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll is higher, due to testing limitations and missed mild cases.

Algeria- The Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sabri Boqadoum, discussed, Thursday, with his Italian counterpart, Luigi de Mayo, the developments of the situation in Libya. According to a statement of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two sides stressed the need to accelerate work to reach an agreement for an immediate cease-fire and to resume the Libyan dialogue to reach a comprehensive political solution that guarantees the unity and sovereignty of Libya and achieves legitimate aspirations and free options for the Libyan people. A statement said that "Boqadoum" visited Italy Thursday at the invitation of his Italian counterpart, as talks between the two sides touched on bilateral cooperation, especially the upcoming session of the high- level Algerian-Italian meeting to be held in Algeria and the visit of the country expected by Italian President "Sergio Mattarella" to Algeria at a later time, in addition to the economic partnership and its promising prospects. The statement added that the two sides have extensively dealt with a number of issues of common concern, foremost of which is the situation in Libya, where they discussed ways to contribute to addressing this crisis in light of the serious deterioration in the field situation and its dire implications for settlement efforts and the security of neighboring countries. The two sides also exchanged views on the situation in the Sahel and ways to enhance coordination between them to support development efforts in the region in a manner that guarantees the consolidation of security and stability.

 I'm curious why the Beach thinks that private businesses are willing to spend $250,000 to enter into a three-year contract to provide lifeguard services in front of their beaches.
   
 There is no financial benefit for any of these businesses to do so. These hotels/motels/condos are already packed during the summer months and running at near full capacity.
   
 Putting lifeguards at their locations does nothing for their bottom line other than drain it. They are dreaming to think that any business will take them up on this program as it currently stands.
   
 This crackpot idea could only have been thought up by someone who has never worked in private business. They also want to empower these same lifeguards to write citations for people swimming during double red flags. This will come to a end real quick when the first lifeguard who tries to write a citation to a country boy from Alabama gets beaten up.
   
 Here is an idea, how about simply not rescuing anyone during double reds? If they are dumb enough to enter the water then let them face the consequences.
   
 Much like the CRA, multi-modal facility, and now the possibility of moving all septic residents to sewer (at a cost of $20,000 each!) the lifeguard program is another dump idea in an entire list of dump ideas.

After many weeks of sitting empty, Historic Rosemont Manor in Berryville will host its first wedding next weekend.
 “We’re excited to get back in the saddle again,” said William “Biff” Genda, whose property has hosted nearly 500 weddings since he purchased Rosemont in 2009. “This is a tough time for brides and grooms.”
 It’s a tough time for wedding vendors, too, as couples have had to push back their wedding dates or downsize their dreams because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The wedding industry — a competitive business with emotional clients and high- stakes outcomes (after all, brides don’t want a coupon for a free cake or bouquet if the first one didn’t turn out OK) — requires the very best each and every time from vendors.
 “A wedding is not something you can re-do,” said Jeff Baker, president for the last 11 years of Shenandoah Wedding Professionals, a nonprofit organization made up of about 30 companies. The membership — which must meet selective criteria to be included in the group — gather regularly to network and discuss industry developments.
 Of course, coronavirus cancellations have been a hot topic among the SWP membership.
 But, Baker said, vendors with strong reputations should once again find their appointment books full when the pandemic is over.
 “I always say the cream will rise to the top,” said Baker, who along with his wife, Amy, has been running Let the Good Times Roll deejay service since 1996 and has provided entertainment at some 500 weddings.
 The Bakers book 50 weddings each year “and the coronavirus has put a big damper on that,” he said. But most of his clients have been rebooking for later in the year or next year. Some are even rescheduling their wedding date around the Bakers’ availability, he said, since they have a reputation for taking care of many details that less experienced deejays may not be aware of.
 “We do a lot more than just push play,” Baker said.
 ♦
 Genda said Rosemont booked 115 weddings for 2020 in either in the main house or in the Rosemont Springs barn, and he expects that 80-90 percent of them will still take place this year since many couples moved their spring wedding dates into the fall. About 70-80 weddings are scheduled to be held in the last half of the year.
 The venue will follow all the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control including doing temperature checks on guests, offering plenty of hand sanitizer and requiring masks be worn. Seating will encourage social distancing and the food will be covered by protective shields.
 “When it comes to dancing, I don’t know what we’ll do,” Genda said. “Guests may have to just dance with the person they came with. And I don’t know if it’s possible to line dance 6 feet apart.”
 Genda said that couples seem to be worried about getting accurate head counts — wondering if they send out 250 invitations will they only get 100 acceptances because people are afraid to attend or to fly.
 Genda is advising couples to stay flexible and not be too concerned about shifting health guidelines or elusive head counts.
 “We are encouraging couples to move forward with their wedding plans,” he said. “We’re planning to still give all our couples a beautiful experience.”
 ♦
 Other vendors are opting to sit out the turmoil and hope for better times next year. The Museum of the Shenandoah Valley on Amherst Street in Winchester is not scheduling any weddings for the remainder of 2020, said the museum’s Deputy Director, Community Relations Julie Armel. The weddings booked for May and June at the MSV were canceled or postponed because the size exceeded Virginia’s guidelines or the museum’s indoor space wasn’t large enough for everyone to socially distance.

ROME, July 11 (Reuters) - Second-placed Lazio slumped to a third successive defeat in the Serie A title race when they were beaten 2-1 at home by midtable Sassuolo in stifling heat at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday.


  Sassuolo had a goal disallowed for offside in the ninth minute and hit the bar before Lazio, beaten by AC Milan the previous Saturday and Lecce on Tuesday, went ahead with a Luis Alberto goal in the 33rd minute.


  But Sassuolo hit back when Giacomo Raspadori turned in Francesco Caputo's cross seven minutes into the second half and Caputo himself headed the winner from point-blank range in stoppage time.


  Lazio, plagued by injuries and struggling to cope with a hectic fixture list, remained stuck on 68 points, seven behind Juventus who were at home to third- placed Atalanta (66 points) later on Saturday. Sassuolo are eighth with 46. (Writing by Brian Homewood, editing by Pritha Sarkar)

Seventeen-year-old Gaurav from Government Model Senior Secondary School in sector 4/7, urban estate, topped in Gurugram in the Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH) examinations for class 10, results of which were declared on Friday.


  Gaurav, who goes by a single name, scored 495 out of 500 marks in the examinations that were held in March. Of the 14,190 students who appeared in the examinations from Gurugram district, 9680 students passed while 1,409 will have to give the examination again. The number of students who did not qualify stood at 3101. The city recorded a pass percentage of 68.22.


  An ecstatic Gaurav said that the result was much better than what he had expected. "I was hoping to top the school but never expected that I would top the district as well. My parents are extremely happy," he said.


  He credited his parents and teachers for their support.


  "Despite meagre resources, my parents have always encouraged me to focus on my studies. They are overwhelmed with the results and happily sharing the news with everyone," said Gaurav, who has opted for the Science stream and aspires to pursue engineering after school. He has secured a perfect 100 in math that also happens to be his favourite subject. His father is a carpenter while his mother is a domestic help. The family is from Jharkhand.


  He has already started preparing for the IIT-JEE examination, "I am studying at home. IIT-JEE is a tough examination and I need to start early since we cannot afford coaching or tuition of any kind."


  In an unprecedented academic year marred by the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Haryana board had called off examinations in some subjects after the lockdown was imposed. The board took into account the average of monthly tests for marking the remaining papers.


  "The declaration of the result was delayed a lot. We were on tenterhooks throughout since earlier also there had been false alarms about results getting declared. There was a lot of uncertainty since we were unsure if the remaining paper would be conducted or not and if we should be preparing for the exam or not," said Gaurav.


  Suman Sharma, Gaurav's principal, said that the school had consistently improved its pass percentage. The overall result of the school was above 94%, she said. "We had started preparing for the boards from last August itself and laid special focus on relatively weaker students," said Sharma.


  District education officer Indu Boken said that the district had improved its performance due to the efforts of students and teachers. "The district is on the fifth spot within the state (on pass percentage). We will continue to put more effort in the coming years," said Boken.

And the guest list topped out at 10 people — including the officiant, who wore a mask.
 “It was lovely,” Sara said of her wedding day. “It was sweet. There was something really special about it.”
 The honeymoon plans had to be changed too. Instead of two weeks in Italy, the couple ended up renting a cabin in Davis, West Virginia.
 “It’s a real pretty area. We rented a secluded cabin. And we took our cat, Frankie, who cried and meowed and howled the whole way,” Sara said. “We couldn’t go anywhere and do anything, but it was beautiful.”
 Sara is now a bridesmaid in a couple of weddings scheduled for this fall. She knows what the brides are going through and tries to ease their anxiety as they debate whether to hold their own ceremonies.
 She advises them that whatever happens, their day will be still be special and memorable.
 Maybe the best gift she can pass along would be her attitude of gratitude even when her big day turned into a small celebration.
 “We were raised in a happy house,” said Sara, who has two older brothers. “We all have the same trait — to make lemonade out of lemons. My mom is like that too.”
 Her wedding day was perfect, Sara said, even when everything didn’t go according to plan.
 Not only did she hurt her foot shortly before the ceremony and had to wear a protective boot on her wedding day, but her mother--in-law — the tireless napkin maker — couldn’t attend.
 She contracted COVID-19 and got very sick.
 “They had to intubate her and it was touch and go for a while,” Sara said. But she recovered from the virus and was able to watch the festivities on Facebook from her home in New Jersey.
 Sara said maybe she and David will get to Italy one day. In the meantime, they have lots of beautiful memories and several hundred wedding favors.
 “Now we have all these napkins with that date on them,” Sara said. “Eventually, we’ll have a party and give out the napkins — or we’ll just have a lot of napkins.”

MONTGOMERY — Seeking a political comeback, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is trying to beat out ex-college football coach Tommy Tuberville in Tuesday's Republican primary runoff and reclaim the Alabama Senate seat he held for decades. To do that, Sessions also has to go through President Donald Trump.


  Trump has endorsed Tuberville, whose name recognition comes from his time on the sidelines at Auburn University, and turned decisively against his former Cabinet member, making direct appeals for Alabama voters to reject Sessions's candidacy. "Do not trust Jeff Sessions," Trump tweeted this spring. "He let our Country down." And he weighed in again Saturday on Twitter, calling Tuberville "a winner who will never let you down" and castigating Sessions as "a disaster who has let us all down. We don't want him back in Washington."


  Sessions safely held the Senate seat for 20 years before resigning to lead Trump's Justice Department. Their relationship soured after Sessions withdrew from the investigation of Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election, a move that infuriates Trump to this day. Sessions said he had no choice because he participated in Trump's 2016 campaign and could have been a potential subject or witness.


  He has asked voters to look past the feud. "I'm calling on the people of Alabama and I'm saying this. You know me. You know I can be trusted," Sessions said during a campaign stop this past week.


  "I have stood with you. I have advanced our values and I'm asking you now to stand with me and make sure that the seat from Alabama in the United States Senate is not a potted plant, not an empty suit and is somebody who knows the issues and will fight for them."


  The winner of the runoff will take on the incumbent, Democrat Doug Jones, in a race with major implications for Senate control.


  Republicans are defending 25 of the 38 Senate seats in play this year. Democrats must gain at least three to capture the majority. It's a difficult but achievable task as they also try to win back the White House. But their path becomes significantly steeper if Republicans are able to take the Alabama seat, which Jones captured in a 2017 special election contest that was upended by sexual misconduct allegations against the GOP nominee, Roy Moore.


  In the weeks leading up to the runoff, Sessions has escalated his attacks on Tuberville, questioning both his involvement in a hedge fund in which Tuberville's partner pleaded guilty to fraud and Tuberville's handling of a case where a football player was accused of statutory rape. Tuberville's campaign told The New York Times that his involvement in the hedge fund was a mistake that he has paid for, and has defended Tuberville's handling of the player's case.


  Sessions has also derided Tuberville as a "tourist," because he was until recently registered to vote in Florida.


  A political newcomer, Tuberville is armed both with Trump's endorsement and the statewide name recognition that comes from the Auburn job. Believing he has a comfortable lead, Tuberville has turned to a familiar page in the football playbook, looking to run out the clock in the final days.


  His campaign declined to make Tuberville available for an interview or disclose any of his appearances in the week leading up to the primary. He has declined Sessions' multiple challenges to a debate, despite initially saying that he would participate.


  "Jeff Sessions was a disaster. It's time to send a message to Jeff Sessions that President Trump does not want him or his cronies in the swamp," Tuberville wrote on Twitter last month.


  Jack Campbell, a political consultant and talk radio host who supports Tuberville, said Trump's disavowal of Sessions has become the chief issue of the campaign.


  "It's totally the Trump recusal issue," Campbell said. "I think that's it in a nutshell."


  Sessions had been the first senator to endorse Trump, donning a red "Make America Great Again" hat and infusing the 2016 campaign with a dose of Washington credibility. Their alliance solidified as Trump adopted the hard- line immigration proposals that Sessions had championed for years in the Senate.


  But in a twist of political irony, the president who remade the Republican Party in Sessions's image is now trying to push him out of it. Trump planned to hold a rally for Tuberville in the campaign's closing weeks, but called it off due to concerns about the resurgence of coronavirus cases and the potential for a repeat of his embarrassingly low attended campaign event in Oklahoma.


  Alabama-based political consultant David Mowery said Sessions' change of fortune is "almost mind-boggling." Sessions once held the Senate seat so securely he didn't even draw a challenger.


  "He is fighting for his political life, basically against the president's Twitter account," said Mowery. He said it is hard to overestimate Trump's influence in Alabama. Sixty-two percent of statewide voters supported Trump in 2016, and Mowery quipped that Trump is "about 2 points behind Jesus" in popularity among state Republicans.


  Tuberville led Sessions by 2 percentage points in the crowded March primary but neither reached the threshold needed to avoid a runoff. The third-place finisher, U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, has not endorsed in the race.


  The primary was in March, but the runoff as delayed until summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Mowery said the Tuberville campaign feels confident, "but the question is, as always, who votes. That question is totally different in a pandemic when people are being encouraged to vote absentee."


  Sessions is banking on his long history with voters.


  David Mosley of Ozark greeted Sessions beside the bins of peanuts and watermelons after a campaign stop at Sweet Creek Farm Market. Moseley said he plans to vote for Sessions.


  He said Sessions visited with his units during both of his National Guard deployments, asking the deployed soldiers how he could help them.


  "That stuck out to me as someone who cares," Mosely said.

This is apparent in an online game created in 2016 by the FBI to teach teenagers how to prevent violent extremism. In one scenario, students are given a list of fictional social media posts and asked to identity the one "most likely a violent extremist looking for new recruits." The correct answer is a post asking if anyone is interested in joining him at "that awful animal testing lab" to "send them a 'powerful' message and shut them down once and for all." It's a vague post that could refer to a destructive act, but it could also refer to mere political protest. The message it sends to students is clear: certain forms of political speech are suspicious. (The initial version of this game used as an example of reportable behavior a student with a Muslim-sounding name discussing an overseas trip. After civil rights groups objected to the game's promotion of racial profiling, this specific example was changed. Civil rights groups still objected to the game on grounds that it promoted racial and religious profiling.

As he sat at home under quarantine after testing positive for the coronavirus, Marcus Smart would watch news coverage of the growing pandemic.
 The Celtics guard, who showed no symptoms when the test results were revealed on March 19, saw the death toll mount and the number of serious ill patients rise throughout the world on a daily basis.
 "Scary," said Smart, speaking on a video conference with the media this week from the Auerbach Center. "It was terrifying to actually watch on the TV, to hear about it.
 "I was diagnosed with it and it could have been me that was affected differently. I could have been symptomatic. I could have been in certain positions that certain people were. It was scary because no one really knows the extent of this virus. No one really knows exactly what to do."
 The 26-year-old Smart had been tested on March 14, four days after the Celtics played their final game before the NBA suspended the season. Smart and his teammates were already quarantined after flying back home from Milwaukee on March 12.
 "We took the precautionary measures before I even knew," Smart said. "When the diagnosis came, I isolated myself even more, washed everything over and over each day. The good thing about it is my girlfriend bought everything before the outbreak. I was set in the house.
 "I really isolated myself from her and my cousin. Took extra measures. You go overboard with it. You're washing everything constantly. I drank more water than I've ever drank in my life."
 Smart recovered from the coronavirus in a short time and was on a plane with his teammates Wednesday, headed to Florida where the remainder of the NBA season will be played.
 The Celtics will practice and scrimmage for the next three weeks before playing the Milwaukee Bucks July 31.
 "I feel great," Smart said. "I'm ready to rock and roll."
 Smart tested positive for the antibodies and donated plasma to the American Red Cross. The plasma can attack the virus and help others who have the coronavirus.
 When the Celtics' season is over, Smart intends to donate some more plasma when he gets back to Boston.
 "It was a very humbling experience," Smart said, "just to know that somewhere someone in this world is going to take my plasma and it could possibly help them save their life or give them a fighting chance. That was unique in that part.
 "It was harmless and painless. I encourage everyone if you had the antibodies to donate. You don't know whose life you might change."
 Since he was asymptomatic, Smart said he was "skeptical" when he first learned about testing positive.
 But he quickly took all the precautions necessary while in quarantine and paid close attention to the virus.
 "For me, I was a little skeptic at first, especially when I got that call that I was diagnosed with it just for the simple fact you feel nothing," Smart said. "That was just me. I heard other cases where people are really having trouble with the respiratory system and things like that or even people who had COVID and coming back with the antibodies and trying to work out and they've having complications and problems.
 "For me, my mindset was I'd rather be safe than sorry. Even though I do have that skepticism, I'm going to take the safe way, really, really hone in on making sure I do my part of staying inside, washing my hands and keeping my distance from people because we don't know what this is. It's kind of hard.
 "The skepticism from me comes how can I know what you're telling me without seeing anything is true? Somebody just called me and told me, yep, you were diagnosed with COVID. Well, how do I know that? I haven't seen any paper work, anything. I don't know what is going on in those labs. But I'd rather be safe than sorry."
 Smart, who is averaging a career-best 13.5 points and 4.8 assists in his sixth season with the Celtics, has sent out the message to young people that the virus is serious and should be paid attention to for the sake of others.
 "In my age group, we feel a little bit of invincibility," Smart said. "We're young. We feel like we're in the best shape of our lives and nothing can happen to us.
 "That's the scary part because all it takes is one guy to really open everybody else's eyes. You don't want it to even get there. You want to try to prevent that and I think us older guys, guys who've had COVID like me, really chew down on the fact of taking it as serious as possible.
 "You might not take it as serious, but you're putting other people at risk. You go out there asymptomatic and you don't know and you go to your grandma or you go home to your kid, your wife who is pregnant. You don't know because you don't feel anything and you don't need to get tested. Now you spread it and it's out of control even more than what it is."
 Even though Smart has had the coronavirus and is feeling fit and ready to play the rest of the NBA season, he's still unsure whether the illness will have a lingering affect on him.
 "Who's to say even now I have the antibodies, the virus is gone, how it's going to affect me in the long run five years from now, things like that,'' Smart said. "It's a scary moment for us right now as a human race. We're all trying to figure it out. Everyone is scared and confused."

This year’s Shenandoah County Fair has been canceled, the fair association board announced on Thursday.
 The decision was made to abide by state restrictions about meeting in large groups during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Tom Eshelman, general manager of the Shenandoah County Fair Association.
 “Basically, we see no upcoming changes anytime soon,” Eshelman said.
 Though most fair events have been canceled, a condensed version of the 4-H/FFA Livestock Show and Sale will go on as planned.
 After holding off on a decision about the fair until the July 4 holiday weekend, Eshelman said fair officials couldn’t wait any longer on Gov. Ralph Northam’s next announcement about whether Virginia will move forward with reopening plans.
 “Unfortunately, our window of opportunity has closed and we are regrettably having to cancel the fair,” Allen Gochenour, president of the Shenandoah County Fair Association, states in a news release.
 “We kept our fingers crossed that the Governor could ease the rules of the number of folks that could be on our grounds. We now face the reality that there will be no easing of the 1,000 person rule anytime soon.”
 The restrictions note that concert venues, fairs and carnivals “may operate with occupancy limited to 50% of the occupancy load on the certificate of occupancy or a maximum of 1,000 patrons, whichever is less, while maintaining 10 feet of distance between persons not from the same household,” the release states.

After the successful Southend opening of South Essex College in 2004, and the relocation of the Thurrock campus to £45 million facilities in the centre of Grays in 2014, it seemed inevitable that the outdated Basildon campus would also see a change.


  In the early 2010s, there were extensive plans for a huge new campus in the centre of town similar to the Southend and Thurrock campuses, offering young people in Basildon a state of the art campus in the centre of town rather than a decaying college up near the hospital.


  However, after Basildon's regeneration master plan began to form, it became clear that a campus on that scale wasn't going to part of the town's vision for the future.


  Instead, a much smaller campus is currently being built on the former site of Basildon Market, with the old campus near the hospital being changed into flats.


  With the local reaction to the new Thurrock campus being less than stellar, it might not be the revolutionary change of demographic the struggling town needed.

The oldest members of Generation Z are entering their 20s and stepping into either the workforce or the world of higher education. And they will change the landscape of our society with their ideas and values – many of which omit the idea of Christian faith and the prospect of church membership.
 A POST-CHRISTIAN GENERATION
 James White, in his groundbreaking book "Meet Generation Z," notes “the most defining mark of members of Generation Z, in terms of their spiritual lives, is their spiritual illiteracy…They do not know what the Bible says. They do not know the basics of Christian belief or theology. They do not know what the cross is all about. They do not know what it means to worship.”
 This knowledge gap is the result of a massive cultural value shift from the sacred to the secular, and it has led to increasing numbers of students abandoning their faith and losing interest in the church.
 According to Jean Twenge, this secularizing of society has manifested itself in Gen Z as “disconnecting completely from religion, spirituality, and the larger questions of life” (iGen). In fact, the Barna Group characterizes Gen Z as the “first truly ‘post Christian’ generation,” with only 4% adhering to a Biblical worldview.
 As a result, scriptural authority has come under fire and fewer teenagers are trusting what the Bible has to say about contemporary issues. Sean McDowell and J. Warner Wallace, both prolific apologists, observe that “young people today have grown up in a culture that places the individual as the highest authority…and individual feelings often trump facts” (So the Next Generation Will Know). Moral relativism has been noted as one of the defining trademarks of Gen Z as they move away from traditional values that fail to account for their everyday experiences. Thus, it is the general consensus that sincere belief equals absolute truth.
 BARRIERS TO FAITH
 As Christian values decline in their cultural context and a desire for tolerance surges, Gen Z articulates several barriers to faith and church membership. First, the problem of evil and the existence of suffering is the largest deterrent to a belief in the existence of God (29%), which one third of non-Christian teens believe cannot be ultimately known. Second, while Gen Z is less likely than previous generations to claim church hypocrisy as a reason for avoiding faith, 23% still articulate concern. Lastly, the history of injustices within the church bothers 15% of surveyed teens.

A neighbour realised what had happened and was able to contact her bank, but it was reported that money had already been taken from her account.
 The final incident involved a woman in her 80s in Four Winds in Belfast and was also reported on Friday.
 She was called by a man purporting to be from a telecoms provider, who told her money had been taken from her account and that he needed to check her card.
 Police said no address details were given to the man, but he arrived at the woman's house a short time later and after speaking to her, pushed past her into the house, knocking her to the floor.
 He then proceeded to take her card and bank details before fleeing.
 ## Family advice
 Det Insp Joanne Harris said it was important for families to ensure their elderly relatives were protected and knew "to never give out their financial details without official verification from their bank."
 "Tell them that if they're at all suspicious about a call they receive, hang up and phone the organisation the person is purporting to represent to check their authenticity," she said.
 "Ideally, make the call from another telephone so you can be sure the original caller has not remained on the line. Never be pressured into a transaction over the phone."

July 11 (Reuters) - Canadian Matteo Dal-Cin of Rally Cycling won stage three of the virtual Tour de France on Saturday, pipping Briton Jake Stewart of Groupama-FDJ to the line in a closely-fought sprint to the finish.


  The virtual race is being held on the popular Zwift training platform after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the annual July race to the end of August.


  The 48 km stage was a flatter course compared to the opening weekend but Zwift designed a new course with competitors cycling past simulated real world elements such as the Pont du Gard, the ancient aqueduct bridge in southern France.


  Dal-Cin, 29, won with a time of 59 minutes and 24 seconds -- virtual inches ahead of Stewart -- as the pair pushed through the field on the final sprint while Callum Scotson of Mitchelton-Scott came in third.


  "I'm beyond stoked," Dal-Cin said. "We definitely pulled out all the stops as far as setup went to give us a fighting chance. I'm beyond thrilled with being able to pull out a result for the team.


  "Our coach told us that in the twisty section the draft comes and goes, so just stay up front and I did so until 200 metres to go and used my power-up and sprinted with everything I had."


  NTT Pro Cycling's Ryan Gibbons was in the running too when he initiated the sprint but the South African, who currently dons the yellow jersey, dropped back and finished fifth behind Team Ineos' Ethan Hayter.


  NTT lead the points classification with 161 points followed by Mitchelton- Scott with 85 while CCC Team are third a further 20 points behind.


  In the women's race, Canyon-SRAM's Tanja Erath won the third stage with a time of one hour, six minutes and 24 seconds.


  The former Zwift Academy winner sprinted to the finish to beat time trial world champion Chloe Dygert of Twenty20 and April Tacey of the Drops team.


  "A stage win is always something special," Erath, 30, said. "Zwift is kind of my thing, so I should win a stage and it worked out so I'm super happy." (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Christina Fincher)

After launching the musical "Waitress" on Broadway, Sara Bareilles didn't plan to make a TV show. But then filmmaker J.J. Abrams came calling.
   
 That's what led to "Little Voice," the romantic drama series that debuted Friday on Apple TV+ that counts both Abrams and Bareilles as executive producers, and features the singer's music.
   
 Bareilles was a huge fan of "Felicity," the Keri Russell university-set TV series that Abrams co-created. And Abrams was a big admirer of "Waitress," based on the 2007 movie that also happened to star Russell.
   
 "Apparently I have a Keri Russell thing," Bareilles joked to the Daily News.
   
 Abrams didn't have a plan, but he wanted more of what Bareilles and co-writer Jessie Nelson did with their 2016 Broadway show about a waitress in an abusive marriage.
   
 "I started thinking about, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to see that same sort of tone (as 'Felicity'), but what if Felicity was a songwriter?' The idea of a young woman, a young person, finding their voice as an artist and as a person," Bareilles said.
   
 That eventually became "Little Voice," a sweet musical show about Bess King, a wannabe singer struggling through her early 20s in New York. Two love interests -- Ethan (Sean Teale) and Samuel (Colton Ryan) -- and her best friend Prisha (Shalini Bathina) try to help, while her dad (Chuck Cooper) and autistic brother (Kevin Valdez) get in her way without trying.
   
 "The beauty about this show is that it has a sense of normalcy or relatability," Brittany O'Grady, the "Star" alum who plays Bess, told The News. "The stakes internally were so high for the character and people could feel that without the world ending or without these extremes of highs and lows."
   
 For Bess, the stakes revolve around music, where she faces debilitating stage fright after being laughed off during her last attempt; her brother, with an obsession-like love of musical theater; and her father, an alcoholic who makes a living singing in subway stations. Would-be beau Samuel woos her with his own music, while love-interest Ethan makes movies.
   
 "He brings his view of the world in a cinematic form," said Teale, the British actor who plays the filmmaker. "He's a keen observer and he's keenly intelligent based on that. From his hardships, he learned to see the world in a lovelier way."
   
 "Bess is positive about the world, but it's also a really hard world for her to live in. I think Ethan is capable of showing her that that life is still worth living and that there are joys within that."
   
 Bareilles, 40, wrote all of the songs for the show. Some are old demos that never made it onto her albums, including the theme song, while others were written just for "Little Voice." The music, she said, let her go back to the early part of her career, when she was struggling just like Bess.
   
 "You're in your early 20s and people are telling you you're an adult but you don't really feel it," she said. "You're doing whatever you can to make ends meet and get on your own two feet for the first time. That's where we find Bess, in the first taste of independence. What does that look like for a young artist?"
   
 Bareilles referred to herself and her "Waitress" writing partner Nelson -- who's credited as a creator on "Little Voice" -- as "hope-aholics."
   
 "We really believe in the goodness of people and we want to tell stories about good people who make mistakes, but their essence remains intact," she said. "It's not a show with a tone of cynicism or disbelief in the fundamental good nature of humanity. Even in the midst of the psychotic chaos we stare at in the news all day, I really believe in the fundamental goodness of humanity."
   
 For Ryan, who plays Samuel, "Little Voice" is about "young people trying to not just find their voice but also in the midst of trying to pay their rent."
   
 In a TV landscape filled with shows about the afterlife, Nazi hunters and a governmental agency tasked to put boots on the moon, "Little Voice" is simply the story of a girl trying to find her way.
   
 "It feels pure of heart," Ryan said, "because it is pure of reality."

THANEIn the last 24 hours, three vehicles including two trucks and a tanker overturned on the Nagla Bunder, Ghodbunder road. The authorities claimed that these vehicles lost control while manoeuvring the sharp turn on this stretch. The traffic police had earlier barricaded this spot, however the barricades were removed recently, during the lockdown. On Saturday evening around 5pm a tanker carrying methyl methacrylate chemical, 900195.00 kg, toppled on Ghodbunder road near Gaimukh Chowpatty. This is 500-meters away from the Nagla Bunder. The tanker was going to Ambernath from Surat. The driver did not suffer any injuries while no chemical was leaked.In another incident on Friday around 8.30pm a truck carrying 25 empty LPG cylinders, toppled on Ghodbunder road near Nagala Bunder police chowky, Gaimukh Gaon. All the cylinders were on the road leading to a traffic jam. In the second incident yesterday at the same spot, at 10.45pm, a truck carrying chemical drums overturned as driver lost control over vehicle due to over speeding.Santosh Kadam, chief of resident disaster management cell, said, "These accidents happened near Nagla Bunder at a sharp turn. The chemicals were not hazardous therefore there was no need to worry but we have informed Thane traffic police and Kasarwadwli police to keep a check post over there so that vehicle will slow down while taking a turn. The roads are empty due to the lockdown and therefore these drivers come in speed and lose control of the vehicle and toppled."According to Kasarwadwli police officers due to Covid-19 lockdown the barricades were removed but they were put again on Saturday with the traffic police and Kasarwadwli police bandobast. "We were short staffed due to the pandemic and had removed the barricades, however after the three accidents the barricades are now installed at the spot to ensure that the drivers slow down and avoid a major tragedy," an officer from Kasarvadavli said. The accidents happened within 500 meters of Nagla bunder turn.

WINCHESTER — If it weren’t for 700 cloth napkins, Sara Myers Bozowski might still be single.
 Sara and her finance David Bozowski were scheduled to be married April 25. Every detail had been planned for a 150-person ceremony inside Cloverdale Barn in Frederick County.
 But because of the coronavirus pandemic and Gov. Ralph Northam’s order prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, the couple had to cancel their wedding plans.
 Sara sent out postcards to her guests telling them that the wedding couldn’t be held. “Half of our garage was full of wedding things, and they’re still sitting there,” said Sara, who lives in Northern Virginia and works as a human resource specialist for a global energy firm in Arlington.
 The couple considered not getting married on April 25. But what would they do with all the wedding favors?
 Her mother-in-law had cut all the fabric and hemmed 700 cloth napkins. She’d even sewn little tags with Sara’s and David’s names and the date of their wedding onto the napkins, which would be packaged into groups of four to be given out as wedding favors to the guests.
 Not only were the napkins to be a keepsake from the wedding, but they expressed an important value shared by Sara and David — they don’t use paper products.
 So Sara, 41, and David, 44, decided to keep their wedding date, but had to scramble and make plans for a much smaller wedding in a short amount of time.
 “We are the type of people who go with the flow,” she said of herself and her husband, who works as a chef. “We decided we were still going to make it the best day ever and make our memories.”
 The wedding gown Sara selected was still at the shop in Manassas being altered. Luckily, she was able to pick up the dress before the store closed for weeks. Unfortunately, she couldn’t try it on at the store.
 “Luckily, it was perfect,” she said.
 As for a venue, her mother and stepfather lived in the Lake Frederick community off Front Royal Pike. The clubhouse facing the lake made an ideal setting for the wedding.
 The appetizers prepared by the restaurant there, Region’s 117, were delicious, she said. Everyone drank mimosas and shared a champagne toast.
 Her mother made vanilla and chocolate cupcakes and put the cake topper, purchased to sit atop the large wedding cake, on a cupcake.

The county’s letter requested the state consider local data when determining any future state-ordered closing of businesses, considering a large number of cases that have occurred in the county were related to family gatherings of people from multiple households, as well as one workplace outbreak in a manufacturing facility.


  The letter signed by Sullenger said the county established a team to work with businesses on educating them on the importance of adhering to public health orders, to provide information and distribute personal protective equipment, and to assist in developing procedures to mitigate risks of COVID-19 transmission.


  “It seems unjust to close certain businesses at this economically perilous moment without evidence they are a significant factor in the spike in cases,” the July 7 letter stated. “Sutter County asks that the state take a closer look at the actual risk posed by industries, such as food service, where sanitation and social distancing are practiced, and reconsider whether it is necessary to order the closure of these businesses at all. As the state has been willing to do in the recent past, please allow local governments to make these decisions based upon local data.”


  Gallagher also sent his own letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on July 7 on behalf of the six counties he represents urging the state to allow North State counties to make decisions about COVID-19 restrictions based on local contact tracing data.


  Gallagher said the reopening of dine-in restaurants — including bars, breweries and wineries — has not been a driver of COVID-19 cases within his district. He said contact tracing has shown that funerals and family gatherings have largely been where residents have contracted the virus.


  Under the state mandate, indoor activities in Yuba-Sutter restaurants and bars will be required to shut down next week. Gallagher said many of the local businesses don’t have enough outdoor space to continue operations if the state order goes into effect, and those restaurants have already been through a great deal of turmoil throughout the pandemic.


  “If counties in my district continue to be added to the monitoring list, I ask that they be allowed, consistent with certifications and regional variations, to provide for their own roll-back and prevention measures based on local contact tracing data, as opposed to implementing a blanket closure on activities like in-door dining,” Gallagher said. “As the state has been willing to do in the recent past, please allow local governments to make decisions based upon local data.”


  In his letter, Gallagher also requested the state release Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding dedicated to the six counties within his district.


  “This funding is critical for us to provide essential services and help with the recovery of our communities from COVID-19,” he said. “It is also vital to our ability to continue to adequately manage this public health crisis.”

Pune/Mumbai: Just when Pune was coming to terms with announcement about 10-day lockdown starting Monday, Maharashtra government on Saturday transferred Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad. Vikram Kumar, who is serving as chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), will be the new civic chief.


  Gaikwad has been posted again as sugar commissioner, a position he was serving before joining as municipal commissioner in January this year. Kumar, a 2004 batch IAS officer, on the other hand has served in various capacities, including CEO of Maharashtra Maritime Board before taking charge in PMRDA in 2019.


  The bureaucratic reshuffle in Pune came when Covid-19 cases in city have reached 26,904 as 827 fresh cases were reported on Saturday. The rising cases forced administration to announce lockdown, prompting sharp reactions from business community and political circles as many were looking to make up losses in business.


  The announcement about lockdown, which according to officials, will be far more stricter, hasn't gone down well among residents too as they rued the "flip-flop" approach as it came just days after chief minister announced "mission begin again".


  Puneites on Saturday stepped out in large numbers to stock grocery and vegetable after the lockdown announcement was made. As a result, prices of essential commodity like vegetables went up.


  As the administration declared that grocery shops and vegetables sale will be shut during the first phase, fear of shortage gripped many parts with citizens coming out for panic shopping.


  "I stepped out at 7 am first to fill up petrol in my car and then headed to D-Mart for grocery. However, I found that people had already gathered since early morning," said Rahul Chavan, a banker residing on Pune-Satara road.


  Places like D-Mart and Grahak Peth, a cooperative departmental store, saw huge crowd, reminiscent of scenes during March and April when the Centre and state had announced lockdown.


  Several BJP leaders, including party national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, city MP Girish Bapat and Shivajinagar legislator Siddharth Shirole said MVA government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has no concrete plan to deal with the coronavirus crisis.


  Industry bodies and associations in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad also opposed the state government's decision to impose lockdown once again fearing that post restrictions since March will disrupt the industry and increase further losses for the companies and business establishments. PCMC MLA Mahesh Landge too has petitioned the state government seeking no lockdown for PCMC industries while Federation of Traders Association of Pune has stated the lockdown will result in huge losses causing tremendous financial and physical suffering to the business owners and their employees. The PCMC administration has already declared ten day lockdown in PCMC area as per the directions of the state government.


  Besides' Gaikwad's transfer, state government has also posted Saurabh Rao as officer on special duty at Pune divisional commissioner office while agriculture commissioner Suhas Diwase will be new chief executive officer at PMRDA.


  Rao was working as sugar commissioner in Pune. Another bureaucrat Jitendra Dudi serving as project officer, Integrated Tribal Development Project and assistant collector, Manchar sub division in Pune has been appointed as chief executive officer of Sangli zilla parishad

Gurugram Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday inaugurated the second reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test machine in Civil Hospital, sector 10, via video conferencing. With this, the Gurugram government lab's capacity to test the Sars-CoV-2 virus nucleic material, which causes Covid-19, will rise to 500 samples a day from 200. RT-PCR testing is the gold standard frontline test for Covid-19. Seven private labs in the can conduct up to 500 to 600 RT-PCR tests a day. "The results will be delivered in 24 hours. If required, we can test up to 700 samples every day," said Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer. On Saturday, 2345 samples were collected, of which 1789 were taking by health department, including the antigen test. At least 556 samples for RT-PCR were taken by private labs. Since March, more than 60,000 people in the city have been tested for Covid-19. "Since June 24, more than 30,000 tests have been conducted in the city," said Yadav. Out of them, 16,109 samples were through antigen detection kits, while the remaining 13, 891 are being tested through RT-PCR in both government and private labs. Testing has increased in the last two weeks. Earlier, on an average 1000-1500 tests were being done in a day, which this week increased to almost 3000.Gurugram initially sent its samples to All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS) Delhi for testing. As the cases increased, samples were getting tested in PGIMS -Rohtak, Sonepat Medical College, and private labs too.

And finally the most confusing news today have to do with Google and the company's Pixel and Nest roadmap.. Or should I call it mess. First, we get a teaser from Google for the upcoming Nest, which will be the successor to the original Google Home. We usually get these in the fall along with the Pixels but this video looks like if there's no more waiting to be done… and jumping back to Pixel here's where it gets confusing. The guys over at 9to5Google dug into the Android 11 Beta code and found Google's entire line up for 2020 with their codenames. It starts with the Pixel 4 and 4 XL that we currently have, it then moves up to the Pixel 4a which we'll talk more about in a second, but then it goes on to the Pixel 5 and instead of "redfin" being the codename for the Pixel 5 XL like we expected, we get a Pixel 4a 5G, because… why not, this is Google. We're expecting the Pixel 4a to launch with the Snapdragon 730, while the Pixel 5 is tipped to bring the Snapdragon 765G. Now, if you think about it, this might mean that we could get these phones together, and that it's just the Pixel 4a lineup, one smaller and one larger with 5G, which could be that quote-unquote Pixel 5 we covered the other day, that looks identical to the 4a, just larger. Speaking of the launch, welcome back Jon Prosser! We were waiting on the Pixel 4a announcement which was reportedly going to launch on Monday, July 13th but, according to Prosser it just got pushed back. He claims that the system now shows that the announcement will be happening until August 3.

WINCHESTER — Making connections is an integral part of both business ownership and alumni affairs for colleges and universities.
 Lord Fairfax Community College is working to put those two together by starting an alumni business directory to connect local communities to local businesses while celebrating the accomplishments of those who have come through the college.
 “The business directory was something that I always wanted to do as soon as I learned we were going to be more active with alumni affairs,” LFCC Outreach and Alumni Coordinator Kelli Williams said. “Once we laid the groundwork for that, we were able to pursue special projects like the business directory.”
 Williams and the project group at LFCC worked with local chambers of commerce and used email and social media to track down local businesses with ties to the college.
 “Some of them opened restaurants, some offer really unique services, some are lawyers. It’s all across the board with how far they’ve gone,” she said. “So we wanted to connect community members with our alumni business owners.”
 Word traveled and gained support of alumni in the area and across the country.
 “The community, they were on it. That speaks volumes to how great our alumni community is,” said Williams, who graduated from LFCC. “Most of it was word of mouth.”
 Williams said the college created an alumni website -- found at www.lfcc.edu/alumni -- to help connect alumni and the next logical step was to add a special spot for business owners.

Alarmed over activities of the organised gangs of oil thieves, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), nation's largest public-sector oil corporation, is set for aerial surveillance of the underground pipelines in the strategically significant Mathura-Jalandhar region.


  Official familiar with the development say that the initiative would be the first of its kind in the country where drones would be used for monitoring the security of the underground network of petroleum pipes.


  On July 6, the ministry of civil aviation authorised the IOC to use remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) for the pipelines.


  Officials say the IOC had mooted the plan of aerial surveillance in August 2015, but the project was marred by the bureaucratic hurdles.


  General manager, corporate communications of IOC (pipeline divisions), N Shiva Kumar said on Saturday that in the first stage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be used on Bijwasan (Delhi)-Panipat corridor for four months. He said drones would be pressed into service within a fortnight.


  Drones would help in giving real-time information in case of pilferage or any untoward situation in the pipeline network for prompt action.


  "Since the cases of oil thefts are more in the National Capital Region (NCR), it was decided to roll out the pilot project in Delhi-Panipat to ascertain its efficiency. On the basis of the success of the project, aerial monitoring will be extended on the entire Mathura-Jalandhar belt," said Kumar.


  The petroleum products to defence installations along the international border with Pakistan and China are met through the Mathura-Jalandhar pipeline.


  "Any interruption in the supply of petroleum products for civilian and defence requirements would be drastically hampered in case of any damage to the supply line," said an official.


  The IOC suffered huge losses due to incidents of pilferage. However, undermining the financial losses incurred in oil thefts, the public sector company said the safety of human lives and the environment was of much higher importance for them. "Plugging oil pilferage is certainly significant, but any incident of leakage and sabotage can lead to losses beyond imagination. There were instances in Haryana when gangs dug a tunnel and stole oil. The IOC wants to give a firm answer to such instances," said Kumar.


  Most of the pilferage sites in the NCR were located in agriculture fields, near abandoned water drains, panchayat grounds and forest lands.

Lazio's title dream suffered yet another setback on Saturday as Francesco Caputo's injury-time header grabbed Sassuolo a 2-1 victory at the Stadio Olimpico to hand Juventus the chance to move 10 points clear at the Serie A summit.


  The midweek loss at lowly Lecce appeared to signal the end of Lazio's title challenge, but Juve's implosion en route to a 4-2 defeat by AC Milan kept the gap at only seven points.


  But a third straight loss for Lazio means that when Juve host in-form Atalanta later on Saturday, Juve could either stretch their lead or the Bergamo outfit could climb into second.


  Lazio were only one point behind Juventus when the Italian top flight resumed following the coronavirus lockdown, but they have been beaten four times in six matches since.


  Atalanta, on a winning streak of 11 games in all competitions, could cut the gap to Juve to six points if they beat the Turin giants at the Allianz Stadium.


  A fourth successive league win for Sassuolo boosted their European hopes as they moved within three points of seventh-placed Milan, who occupy the final possible Europa League spot.


  Hosts Lazio survived an early scare when Sassuolo striker Giacomo Raspadori was denied an early goal for offside.


  But Simone Inzaghi's men grabbed the lead against the run of play 12 minutes before half-time as Alberto's blocked shot bounced back off his shin and looped into the top corner.


  It was the former Liverpool midfielder's seventh goal of the season in all competitions.


  But Sassuolo continued to be the better side and deservedly levelled seven minutes into the second period as Mehdi Bourabia won the ball high up the pitch and fed Caputo, who squared for the 20-year-old Raspadori to cap his first Serie A start with a simple tap-in.


  Lazio rarely looked like grabbing an all-important victory, with centre-back Bastos coming closest to a late winner for the home side when he headed over as the capital club finished the match with just one shot on target.


  They always looked vulnerable at the back, though, and Caputo pounced to nod home in the second minute of injury-time after the Lazio defence fell apart after failing to clear a corner.

There, Izabela said she experienced her first taste of acting.


  “We did learn that I not only fell in love with acting, but I fell in love with memorizing scripts, turning into characters and expressing emotions as these characters,” Izabela said. “After a lot of convincing, we moved to LA, and the rest is history.”


  While searching for acting opportunities in California, she eventually landed an audition for Disney Channel’s upcoming movie, “Upside-Down Magic.” When she saw the description of the lead character, Nory, Izabela said she immediately fell in love with the protagonist’s enthusiastic and positive outlook on life — a personality not far from her own.


  She dove into a series of auditions before making it to a chemistry reading with her co-star Siena Agudong, who plays the role of Nory’s best friend Reina. At 12 years old, Izabela booked the role of Nory.


  “We instantly had an amazing connection with each other, which I love because it wasn’t like we were faking being friends, we were friends in real life,” Izabela said.

A neighbour realised what had happened and was able to contact her bank, but it was reported that money had already been taken from her account.


  The final incident involved a woman in her 80s in Four Winds in Belfast and was also reported on Friday.


  She was called by a man purporting to be from a telecoms provider, who told her money had been taken from her account and that he needed to check her card.


  Police said no address details were given to the man, but he arrived at the woman's house a short time later and after speaking to her, pushed past her into the house, knocking her to the floor.


  He then proceeded to take her card and bank details before fleeing.


  ## Family advice


  Det Insp Joanne Harris said it was important for families to ensure their elderly relatives were protected and knew "to never give out their financial details without official verification from their bank."


  "Tell them that if they're at all suspicious about a call they receive, hang up and phone the organisation the person is purporting to represent to check their authenticity," she said.


  "Ideally, make the call from another telephone so you can be sure the original caller has not remained on the line. Never be pressured into a transaction over the phone."

In the not-so-distant future, robots may be cutting and processing packaged meat for Americans.
 Tyson Foods is reportedly accelerating development of robotic technology designed to handle processes like deboning the 39 million chickens that go through the company's plants each week, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.
 While the project has been in the works for several years, the meatpacking company increased urgency around the effort in the wake of a rash of coronavirus outbreaks across its facilities starting in May. Tyson, as well as competitors like Smithfield Foods, quickly became hot spots for spreading the virus, sickening workers and prompting temporary closures that led to national meat shortages.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been a total of 16,233 coronavirus cases in meat processing facilities across 23 states in the US. As of July 10, these illnesses have contributed to 86 deaths, the CDC findings show.

Jason was the live wire in the family. He was my youngest and full of energy.


  One day, when he was three years old and playing outside in the snow with his older siblings, they all came storming into the house. The older ones were complaining that Jason was knocking the snow house down that they were building. I sent the older two back outside and kept Jason inside. I told him he was being punished for what he did. Whereupon, he made my hand into a fist, threw himself on it and said, “Punch me then, so I can go back outside.”


  That was the same year our family made a trip to Florida. We were spending a night in a motel. I put Jason in the shower and turned on the water. This was a new concept to him, as our house didn’t have a shower at that time. “Let me out!” he shouted. “It’s raining in here!”

In the last 24 hours, three vehicles including two trucks and a tanker overturned on the Nagla Bunder, Ghodbunder road. The authorities claimed that these vehicles lost control while manoeuvring the sharp turn on this stretch. The traffic police had earlier barricaded this spot, however the barricades were removed recently, during the lockdown.


  On Saturday evening around 5pm a tanker carrying methyl methacrylate chemical, 900195.00 kg, toppled on Ghodbunder road near Gaimukh Chowpatty. This is 500-meters away from the Nagla Bunder. The tanker was going to Ambernath from Surat. The driver did not suffer any injuries while no chemical was leaked.


  In another incident on Friday around 8.30pm a truck carrying 25 empty LPG cylinders, toppled on Ghodbunder road near Nagala Bunder police chowky, Gaimukh Gaon. All the cylinders were on the road leading to a traffic jam. In the second incident yesterday at the same spot, at 10.45pm, a truck carrying chemical drums overturned as driver lost control over vehicle due to over speeding.


  Santosh Kadam, chief of resident disaster management cell, said, "These accidents happened near Nagla Bunder at a sharp turn. The chemicals were not hazardous therefore there was no need to worry but we have informed Thane traffic police and Kasarwadwli police to keep a check post over there so that vehicle will slow down while taking a turn. The roads are empty due to the lockdown and therefore these drivers come in speed and lose control of the vehicle and toppled."


   


   


  According to Kasarwadwli police officers due to Covid-19 lockdown the barricades were removed but they were put again on Saturday with the traffic police and Kasarwadwli police bandobast. "We were short staffed due to the pandemic and had removed the barricades, however after the three accidents the barricades are now installed at the spot to ensure that the drivers slow down and avoid a major tragedy," an officer from Kasarvadavli said. The accidents happened within 500 meters of Nagla bunder turn.

WINCHESTER — Part of Stickley Drive (Route 1085) in Frederick County near the town of Stephens City will close for about three months starting Monday morning due to utility work and roadway reconstruction related to the upcoming widening of Fairfax Pike (Route 277).
 The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) announced Friday that Stickley Drive will be closed just south of the intersection with Fairfax Pike. VDOT says drivers who use this portion of Stickley Drive will detour west onto Town Run Lane (Route 1012). Signs will direct drivers on this detour route. Residents and businesses along Stickley Drive will continue to have access to their properties.
 Stickley Drive is scheduled to reopen in mid-October. All work is weather permitting.
 In June, the Commonwealth Transportation Board awarded an $18.2 million contract to General Excavation Inc. of Warrenton for the widening of Fairfax Pike (Va. 277). The widening will extend just east of the Interstate 81 northbound ramps at exit 307 to Double Church Road (Route 641). Fairfax Pike will be widened to four lanes with a median from east of the I-81 northbound ramps to east of Double Church Road, where Fairfax Pike transitions to two lanes.
 Portions of the Fairfax Pike median will be raised and other portions of the median will be striped to provide turn lanes.
 The contract value on the 0.74-mile-long Fairfax Pike widening project has a fixed completion date of June 1, 2023.
 Once completed, the widened stretch of Fairfax Pike will be able to accommodate projected traffic until 2038. The current average daily traffic count is 14,566 vehicles per day. That is projected to increase to 23,428 by 2038, according to VDOT’s website.

I stepped around the corner and informed Shirley that maybe she would like to help me in the kitchen if she wasn’t happy watching television. The false accusations stopped and I was able to make supper in an efficient manner.


  Fred was the oldest and the quiet one. He liked to be by himself. When he was three years old, I got him a toy lawn mower. He had seen his dad mow the yard many times, One warm, sunny day, after breakfast, he went outside with his toy mower and began to “mow.” He went in strips from one end of the front yard to the other, He “mowed” until I called him in for lunch and went right back out again. He came in for supper, went back outside and “mowed” until dark, but he never cut a blade of grass with his little mower. And, he never did it again.


  The children and I had lots of moments together some good, some not so good. Some of them caused me much anguish.


  However, when he grew up, Jason became a jack of all trades.He cooked at several restaurants, laid carpet, painted houses and, eventually, started his own construction company. He once said, as he was working for another contractor, “I didn’t know how easy it is to build a house.” And, one Mother’s Day, he gave me a little pin the shape of a rose, with a card that said, “If mothers were flowers, I’d pick you.”


  Fred joined the U.S. Navy after he graduated from high school and served on a supply ship. One day, when the boiler system went down, he saved the ship from fire and destruction by rerouting the water system. And, one day, when his bud vase didn’t sell at his yard sale, he filled it with wild flowers he had picked and gave it to me.


  Shirley is now business loan manager at a local bank and she and her daughter take me out for Mother’s Day every year. I think she still likes to play tricks on people.


  The offspring and I have shared a lot as a family — much more than just DNA. I found out how important and valuable families are and I’m glad I had one.

But it isn’t just the unchurched who are exhibiting less interest in traditional spiritual ideas and institutions. These trends also impact Christian teens. Of churchgoing Gen Z members, 82% consider church to be “a place to find answers to live a meaningful life” that is “relevant to my life.”
 However, half of students believe that the Bible has exhibited incompatibilities with science (49%) and that churchgoers are hypocritical in their practice (36%). These statistics indicate that the new generational trajectory, aimed toward post-Christian ideas, spiritual illiteracy, and moral relativism, is not merely manifesting itself in unchurched, unbelieving teens. Those who have grown up in church are also at risk.
 THE RESULT
 Overall, barriers to faith and loss of interest in the church have led to increasing rates of atheistic and agnostic beliefs. The Barna Group discovered that “the percentage of teens who identify [as atheist] is double that of the adult population.”
 While 59% of Gen Z identifies with some sort of theistic religion and 7% associate themselves with another faith, 35% percent articulated some form of skepticism. Perhaps most alarmingly, 14% of teenagers classify themselves as “none of the above”–denying any form of ideological or practical alignment with Christianity, Catholicism, atheism, agnosticism, or other religions.
 In light of large bodies of research, it appears that Generation Z doesn’t really know what to believe or why to believe it.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
 I am a member of Generation Z, and I have seen firsthand the loneliness, passion, and confusion of my peers. We are people who long to see change to unjust systems and are actively seeking to solve problems through innovation. We value community. We want to make a difference and see the world become a kinder place. We want to build our identities around something that will last.
 But so many of us are ill-equipped to step into a post-Christian culture. With little knowledge of Scripture or orthodox Christian doctrine, many quickly fall away into apostasy, unbelief, or apathy. Those who remain struggle to cultivate a shallow faith based upon fun activities and a misunderstanding of what the Bible really teaches.
 If the church desires to reclaim Gen Z and reintegrate them into the Body of Christ, then we must educate our children and youth. We must actively seek out the lost and meet them where they are with their questions and concerns. If we remain silent, these trends toward atheism and spiritual illiteracy will continue to grow – and our culture will complete the shift from sacred to secular until Christian thought is no more than a trivial relic of an intolerant, uneducated past.

Taking to his Instagram, he posted a long note where that read: "My uncle, whom I affectionately call dad, was an outsider who made it big in the film industry. I’m glad there is an active debate on the practices behind the scenes. Nepotism is just the tip of the iceberg. I’ve only ever made one film with my family, my 1st, and I’m grateful to be blessed and have that privileged. I’ve gone that extra mile in my career to make my own path, something that dad always encouraged. For me he was the inspiration."

WINCHESTER — City residents can now boast that they live alongside two Hall of Fame musicians.
 David McLaughlin and Marshall Wilborn, both of whom live in Winchester, became famous as members of the Johnson Mountain Boys, a quintet being inducted this fall into the International Bluegrass Music Association’s Bluegrass Hall of Fame and Museum in Owensboro, Kentucky.
 “It’s a really cool thing,” said McLaughlin, a fiddle and mandolin player who was still in high school when the Johnson Mountain Boys formed in January 1978 in the Washington, D.C., area.
 The band’s original lineup included McLaughlin, Dudley Connell, Richard Underwood, Eddie D’Zmura and Larry Robbins. They gained a following thanks to their matching suits and impeccable musicianship.
 When McLaughlin took time off to attend college, he was replaced by Eddie Stubbs, who now serves as the primary announcer for WSM Radio‘s live broadcasts from the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. McLaughlin rejoined the group in 1981, but switched to mandolin so Stubbs could continue as the band’s fiddler.
 By the mid-1980s, the Johnson Mountain Boys had recorded six successful albums and become a top concert draw, but McLaughlin said something was missing. They found that something when they heard Wilborn, a native of Texas, playing bass for the Pennsylvania bluegrass band Whetstone Run.
 “We whispered as we sat there at a table listening to the band, ‘This guy is our missing ingredient,’” McLaughlin said. “We all knew if we could get Marshall or someone of that caliber, it would send us to new heights.”
 “Initially, I told Dudley I could fill in,” Wilborn said. “It was an exciting and fun time.”
 By the time Wilborn became a full-fledged Johnson Mountain Boy in 1986, his new bandmates had already played thousands of gigs around the world. The exhausted group decided to call it quits with a farewell concert on Feb. 20, 1988, in Loudoun County that was recorded for later release as an album.
 That album, “At the Old Schoolhouse,” became a critical and commercial success, earned the Johnson Mountain Boys a 1989 Grammy nomination and convinced the band members to keep playing together. Wilborn couldn’t return on a permanent basis, though, because he and his wife, banjo player and singer Lynn Morris, had already launched The Lynn Morris Band.

Bruce Weber is fortunate that the Kansas State men's basketball team is back in Manhattan.


   


  The Wildcats have been acclimating back to Manhattan with voluntary workouts and following protocols set forth by the K-State medical staff. Several Wildcats have been in Manhattan for almost three months, with the rest of the team arriving for classes either in late May or June.


   


  "The first week was kind of a quarantine (and) get acclimated back to Manhattan," said Weber in a Zoom conference on Friday afternoon. "Then after you pass that, we went through the testing, both the antibody and the regular test."


   


  Luckily enough, no Wildcats tested positive for COVID-19 since arriving back to Manhattan, and the team has been doing voluntary workouts. The full coaching staff has stayed separated from the players at this time, with only K-State strength and conditioning coach Ben McDonald available. All players are wearing masks during their weights and shooting sessions.


   


  Weber took a peek in at the workouts on Friday morning, watching his team do small group activities.


   


  "(We're) trying to keep them in clusters of their apartments," he said. "If one player gets affected and it's not the whole team, we'll see how that goes. We constantly remind them about their safety and being smart. They want to have fun and be college kids in the summer, but right now, it's very difficult of doing that and not spreading the virus.


   


  "Hopefully, we're being safe and smart and we'll see where we're at a couple of weeks from now."


   


  Weber added that next week's workouts will continue to be voluntary and is hoping the full coaching staff can interact with the players in the coming weeks.


   


  Beside the virus, K-State athletes have also been protesting, wanting change to be made around campus due to recent events involving the death of George Floyd.


   


  "Our players I think have moved on," Weber said. "They were a little frustrated at the start. Some of it was talking and understanding the situation and America, and people's rights and things like that, and that you can't get things changed immediately, but change was going to happen.


   


  "Hopefully, in the long run, this is great for Kansas State, great for our country and we can make some necessary changes. Whether if it's K-State or our country, hopefully, we'll continue to make that progress. I thought we've had great dialogue with our players, but I was proud of them. They took it seriously and then it meant something to them. I applaud them worrying about others and hopefully creating some change for the future. We'll continue to have discussions with them as we move forward."


   


  Weber said that 7- to 10-day span was stressful, and applauds K-State administration including athletic director Gene Taylor, executive associate AD Casey Scott and President Richard Myers for stepping in and talking to their athletes on Zoom calls.


   


  One other concern that Weber has is with international students who might have to go home if in-person classes aren't held. The Wildcats have three international players on their roster -- freshman Selton Miguel and redshirt sophomores Rudi Williams and Kaosi Ezeagu.


   


  Once arriving in Manhattan, the trio had to quarantine.


   


  "I've been talking to our administration about it as we move forward," Weber said. "Right now, it looks like Kansas State is hoping to have some in-class classes, which we wouldn't hopefully have any problems. It will definitely be interesting how it unfolds.


   


  "I know it's a concern with a lot of universities, because there are budget crises, they need students. Beside athletes, they need the international students here going to school. I don't think Selton's country is even open at this point for him to even go home. It would be tough for him to go back. We hope it will work out. It's definitely something that has been brought up and been discussed. I know it's important to our university and I'm sure to many others throughout the country."
