The social media platform is super simple in theory but allegedly it's impossible to get likes and that coveted viral video fame--if your looks and your surroundings aren't up to par.

The private sector, which deals with one of the highest tax burdens in the world, is agonizing. Default risk is extremely high at the time, with major names including grain exporter Vicentin and paper mill Celulosa Argentina having missed payments, and many other major players on the verge. “Given the amount of accumulated debt, many firms have been ‘de-capitalised’, meaning the ship will continue to sink,” explained Miguel Arrigoni, CEO of First Capital Group, to _Perfil_ , as he argued for a “bailout for companies.” On the back of more than two years of recession, astronomical inflation, and credit- crunching interest rates, the private sector finds itself increasingly unable to face its obligations, meaning the potential for job destruction is high. Furthermore, firms are relying on a successful debt renegotiation which is no longer expected for the end of March, the effects of which could be felt in the immediate term in terms of easing pressure on the peso, yet the spillover would still be delayed, lagging it by months. Output, as mentioned previously, won’t pick up until the last few months of the year. Will they resist? Add the COVID-19 outbreak and it becomes a nightmare scenario.

Since the global financial system imploded under the weight of excessive leverage and reckless lending in 2007-2008, it came down to the major central banks to save the day. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke took the lead through aggressive interest rate cuts which led to quantitative easing, or monetary stimulus. Europe soon followed suit, with then-European Central Bank president Mario Draghi telling markets he would do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro,” adding, “and believe me, it will be enough.” Soon enough major central banks were pumping billions of dollars, euros and yens into bond markets, pushing down interest rates close to the zero-bound, with yields in Europe going negative — which means bondholders were actually paying sovereigns to hold their debt — as a “wealth effect” in financial assets was expected to trickle down into the real economy.

Mitchell said he took a 15-second swab test and called it "discomforting," but relieved he was able to take it. He encouraged others to be mindful even if they don't suspect they have the virus.

The next campaign DLC for _Borderlands 3_ is Guns, Love, and Tentacles and there's 12 minutes of gameplay footage out ahead of its March 26 release.


  Sir Alistair Hammerlock and Wainwright Jakobs are clearly big fans of the dramatic, as their wedding is taking place on the terrifying ice planet Xylourgos. Big-ass monsters and occult villagers make this DLC feel like it's straight out of an H.P. Lovecraft novel, so expect the creepiness to be dialled up to 11.


  As you can see from the gameplay footage, you'll land on Xylourgos to attend the wedding and find yourself unnervingly alone. Hammerlock and Wainwright aren't answering on the comms, and you encounter some hostile creatures before you get a chance to settle in. As Moze says, it's a "helluva wedding destination", full of eldritch horror, bandits, allies, and bizarre backstories. You'll be armed to the teeth with some new Legendary weapons and looking fly thanks to new cosmetic items like Vault Hunter heads and new vehicle skins.


  But what's most exciting for many Borderlands fans comes three minutes into the above video - Gaige. Everybody's favorite wedding planner and her robot best friend is here, and they're ready to help you make sure Hammerlock and Wainwright's wedding goes off with minimal hitches. It's great to see Gaige return to the Borderlands universe, and it makes perfect sense considering her close relationship with Hammerlock.

The U.S. Supreme Court will postpone its next round of oral arguments that had been scheduled to start later this month, including a high-profile dispute over President Donald Trump's tax and financial records, in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus, a spokeswoman said on Monday.


  The decision to indefinitely delay arguments that had been due to run from March 23 to April 1 marked an increase in the court's response to the coronavirus threat after closing its building in Washington to the public last Thursday.


  Eleven arguments spanning 14 cases were postponed, including Trump's appeals, due to have been heard on March 31, in three separate cases to prevent his financial records from being handed over to Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees and a New York prosecutor.


  Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement the court heeded public health precautions recommended in response to the virus, the latest in many changes that have affected numerous aspects of American life. Arberg said the court "will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances."


  The court made no announcement about the status of arguments scheduled in the rest of the cases due to be heard in their current term, which traditionally would run through the end of June.


  The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Three of the nine justices are over age 70: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (87), Stephen Breyer (81) and Clarence Thomas (71). Ginsburg has experienced a series of recent health issues including treatment in the past two years for pancreatic and lung cancer.


  "Ultimately it may have been out of the concern for the justices' own health, particularly given that the virus is so dangerous to the elderly," said Tom Goldstein, an attorney who frequently appears before the justices.


  Goldstein represents Google in a postponed case that had been scheduled for arguments on March 24 involving a dispute with Oracle Corp over software copyrights.


  The justices will still hold their regular private conference on Friday to discuss various pending appeals, although some justices may participate remotely by telephone, and will announce on Monday as planned the cases it has decided to review or turn away, Arberg said.


  The court could reschedule delayed arguments for April or later, and possibly push its calendar into the summer, Goldstein said. The court's next term is due to begin in October.


  Another postponed case involved a Trump administration bid to shield FBI agents from a lawsuit by three American Muslim men who said they were placed on the government's "no-fly list" for refusing to become informants. Another is a religious rights case involving Catholic school teachers in California.


  Postponement of Supreme Court arguments in such circumstances is rare. Some arguments were postponed in 1918 due to the Spanish flu epidemic and argument calendars were shortened in 1793 and 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks, Arberg said.


  Trump lost in the lower courts in the three financial records cases. Two involve Trump's efforts to stave off congressional subpoenas issued to third parties - his accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks, Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp - demanding his bank records, tax returns and other material.


  The other case involves a criminal investigation into Trump and his family real estate business in which Manhattan's district attorney is seeking the president's tax returns.

  The Tax and Customs Board had as of Monday refunded €151 million in income tax paid in excess. But due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, the authority is asking older people to wait to submit their paper tax returns and avoid unnecessary contact with other people.


  "A lot of older people want to submit their tax returns on paper. This is currently not possible as the service offices of the Tax and Customs Board are closed. However, there is no need to worry and rush with filing one's tax return. The deadline is not until April 30," Gea Otsa, head of communications at the Tax and Customs Board, told BNS.


  "Thus - please do not approach your children or younger relatives, for example, with the wish to submit your tax return by way of drawing up an online tax return with their help. Stay at home and avoid excessive contact. We are providing new information on a running basis. In the event of any questions, the Tax and Customs Board can be contacted via information hotline +372 880 0811 and it is also possible to send us an e-mail at eraklient@emta.ee," she added.


  A total of 618,840 people had filed their tax returns for 2019 to the Estonian Tax and Customs Board by Monday, of which 14,468 had submitted their tax declarations on paper, the authority told BNS.


  Based on the tax returns filed, altogether €166.9 million of income tax paid in excess is to be returned, while €22.5 million has to be paid additionally.


  The deadline for filing income tax returns is April 30. The due date for payment of additional income tax is October 1.


  The number of people who used a basic exemption corresponding to their income in 2019 was 400,200, making up 41 percent of the total number of taxpayers, whereas 530,000 people or 53 percent used a smaller basic exemption than they were entitled to.

Police wouldn’t identify the woman in the video, but of the nine arrest reports obtained by Local 10 from that same evening, 19-year-old Jaises Elam, identified as a student from Detroit, appears to be the woman in the video.


  In the arrest affidavit, it states that Miami Beach Police were responding to the 900 block of Ocean Drive in reference to officers needing assistance due to several patrons fighting. One officer who was running to the scene witnessed a woman punching a police vehicle multiple times while shouting an expletive. When she saw police officers, she began to run. The officer began to chase her southbound on Ocean Drive.


  The police officer who collided with Elam said he was assisting the officer in the chase and that Elam was “also chasing (the first officer) in an attempt to obstruct him from making an arrest."


  The report continues: "Ms. Elam collided with me during the chase, resulting in both of us falling to the ground. As I got up, I attempted to catch up with the (other officer) to assist with the arrest. Ms. Elam quickly turned towards me and violently kicked me with both feet. I subdued Ms. Elam by holding her to the ground until other police officers arrive. Ms. Elam was soon arrested without further incident.”

Die chronisch langen Wartezeiten werden sich damit noch zuspitzen. 2010 hatte die Regierung in Rom einen «Nationalen Plan betreffend Wartelisten» verabschiedet. Die maximalen Wartezeiten im öffentlichen Gesundheitswesen wurden dabei für Notfälle auf 3 Tage festgesetzt, für gesundheitliche Probleme, die nur kurzen Aufschub vertragen, auf 10 Tage und für weniger dringende Fälle je nach Fachgebiet auf 30 bis 60 Tage.


  De facto werden diese Vorgaben aber vielerorts noch immer nicht eingehalten. Laut einer Studie des Zentrums «C.R.E.A Sanità» warteten Patienten 2018 für einen Termin beim Augenarzt durchschnittlich 41 Tage, beim Orthopäden 44 Tage. Für eine Röntgenaufnahme beträgt die Wartezeit im Schnitt 36 Tage, für eine Echokardiografie 60 Tage und für eine Darmspiegelung 112 Tage. Auf ein derart überlastetes System kommt nun die Corona-Pandemie zu, und Experten sind sich einig, dass das System in Süditalien schnell einmal kollabieren dürfte.

These are dismal times. With schools, churches, retail stores, bars, restaurants and offices closing their doors by the hundreds, and the rest of us stuck inside, separated from the outside world, all in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus, it can all feel a bit hopeless—not to mention lonely. Industries across the board are being affected by outbreak, but the independent music sector will feel the ripples in an especially painful way. Concerts, tours and festivals across the world have been cancelled or postponed, and, for indie artists, tour revenue is a crucial if not primary source of income. This means that now is a perfect time to support those artists in some other way, if you’re able. We’re all (hopefully) at home right now practicing social distancing, probably on or near the couch, our entertainment systems eager to supply some comfort. So why don’t you throw on an LP if you have a record player, stream a favorite new release on Bandcamp or just subscribe to your favorite musician’s YouTube page and float away with a tide of their posted videos? You may not be heading out to a concert these next few weeks, but there are still avenues for enjoying and supporting the music that matters to you. Here are a few ways you can help your favorite artists from home.

WEST CHESTER — Law enforcement officers in Chester County responded to an unusually high number of violent assault cases over the past weekend, according to court observers.


  The incidents included the alleged attempted rape of a woman that occurred at a hotel in Uwchlan, the domestic assault of a pregnant woman in Kennett Square, and apparent threats made by a West Whiteland man angry at the construction of the Mariner East 2 pipeline near his home.


  The 10 suspects, all men, were arraigned by Magisterial District Judge Marian Vito of West Chester on Friday, Saturday and Sunday by video link from the Chester County Prison. All but two — including the man who threatened to “raise hell” with an automatic rifle — were being held in lieu of bail on Monday.

By declaring, it has led the Islamic world to social, political and economic turmoil and instability, starting from Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria. Russia, which has recovered, and China, which has strengthened its economy, have taken a more active role in the sovereignty fields left over them in the Islamic World, and in the alliance with the West behind the scenes, they have made the way to gain political and economic interest from the blood and tears shed by Islamic Countries._
