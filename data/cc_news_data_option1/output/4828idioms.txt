Our love of sports and watching our kids perform has taken a big hit in the last eight months and I know it is a controversial topic to say the least, but it is what it is. We have to wait until the powers that be deem that it is safe to start up again. My friends in the school bus business have stock in Tums by now and teachers are doing their thing in ways they would never have imagined.
 We are thankful for all of them as they continue to fight and hope they are able to celebrate. Those in the bar and restaurant business are also suffering and we will try to patronize them in the next few weeks to help them stay afloat.
 I, like many others, have had limited visits with my son and new daughter-in- law (another one of the people I am so thankful for this year). Aaron and I share so much in the sports world and I really miss that.
 This is a Thanksgiving like no other, but we will get through it and hopefully without losing any more of the things that make us happy.
 God bless all of you this Thanksgiving and I hope you are able to spend some of it with those who matter most.

Board Exams can easily bring out the worst anxieties in every student. How am I going to prepare What are the best reference books Is this 5 year solved paper sufficient These are some common dilemmas faced by students. The importance of Board Exams in the foundation of a student rsquo s career can never be overlooked. However, as daunting as CBSE Board Exams may sound, one can easily score 90 marks with the right strategy and approach. So, here are 5 ultimate tricks to score well in CBSE 10th Board Exams 1. Prepare a strategic preparation planThere are two main divisions of subjects theory based and numerical based. So, you need to channelize a strategy that balances time for both the type of subjects. A smart way is to create a combination of two subjects for one day, one from each category. For instance a. Monday Math Englishb. Tuesday Mathematics Hindic. Wednesday Economics Business Studies The subjects and combinations may vary according to the student rsquo s preferences. The core objective is to divide and separate the level of difficulty that each subject inhabits. 2. Study from the Right CBSE BooksNever overlook NCERT Textbooks. CBSE Board Exams are primarily devised from these books. However, especially for subjects that require a lot of practice, NCERT books may not be sufficient. You should be familiar with every other type of question before exams. For that, you need to practice as much as you can and explore all the tricky questions that can be asked in the exams. Besides NCERT Books, you should practice from CBSE Question Banks for a thorough understanding of the concepts. Oswaal Books has introduced its CBSE Question Banks for Class 10th which are strictly based on the ldquo Latest amp Reduced rdquo CBSE curriculum issued for the Academic Year 2020 2021. Oswaal CBSE Question Banks consist of Chapter wise and Topic wise questions for systematic study, Previous Years rsquo Question Papers with Marking Scheme, and Toppers lsquo Answers for Exam Oriented Study. To simplify learning and last minute revision they also include Mind Maps, Revision Notes and lsquo Most likely Questions rsquo generated by experts. 3 Solve Previous Years rsquo Papers After you have familiarized yourself with the different types of questions from NCERT Textbooks, CBSE Question Banks, etc., you should solve a few Previous Years rsquo Papers. With this practice, you will be able to identify the paper pattern that has been devised over the years, identify your weak and strong areas, and work more efficiently for good marks 4. Be thorough with the ldquo Latest Paper Pattern rdquo Did you know that 75 of information is lost and forgotten by the human mind within six days of studying if not revised periodically That is why it is so important for students appearing for CBSE 10th Board Exams to revise and practice the syllabus regularly. Nothing more can help you to get more comfortable with the exam pattern and boost your confidence than attempting Sample Papers. Sample Papers are a rich source to understand the question pattern and get equipped with every mental tool necessary for the examination day. According to student reviews, Oswaal CBSE Sample Papers is one of the best for preparing for CBSE 10th Board Exams. Oswaal CBSE Sample Papers are strictly based on the CBSE Board rsquo s official Sample Paper released on 9th October 2020. They include both Solved amp Self Assessment Papers, designed as per the Reduced Syllabus amp the Latest Question Typologies. These can be extremely resourceful for exam focused practice. Every student is advised to refer to at least 1 good Sample Paper Book for comprehensive preparation. 4. Time Management A student rsquo s most precious resource is TIME. Each subject should be carefully allotted with enough time for completing the syllabus, revision and then practice. Also, students should be mindful of managing time between the subject that needs practice, the ones that need learning, the concepts that are not entirely understood, and the ones that only need to be revised. For instance, one student may be good with Mathematics but not good with languages such as English and Hindi. So, he needs to employ the right amount of time between the two types so that both numerical and theoretical areas can be mastered in the given time. Conclusion Hard Work coupled up with Smart Work is the key to excel in CBSE 10th Board Exams. Rather than resorting to last minute cramming and all nighters, students appearing for CBSE 10th Board Exams should put consistent and planned effort into their preparation.

For people from all walks of life, one of life rsquo s greatest pleasures is bearing your own genetic child. Bringing your progeny into the world ndash a literal part of you, fills us with emotions and feelings that we otherwise were unacquainted with. But just as true is the blessing of having a child, so is the fact that with modern life, pregnancy comes naturally to fewer and fewer people. With infertility in couples reaching to figures like 60 80 million annually globally, ldquo childlessness rdquo seems like a hard pill to swallow but is the reality for many. This has, however, paved the way for medical science to come forth and offer a solution. Initially deemed unacceptable, assisted reproduction is no longer frowned upon, but is accepted and acknowledged across borders. Moreover, MAR or Medically Assisted Reproduction has changed the fundamental understanding of how we procreate. In Vitro Fertilization IVF has not only provided solutions to fertility problems but has gone beyond that. The emotional, social and psychological impacts of IVF have been immense. IVF understands human reproduction and has changed the fundamental understanding of it. Now, with IVF having its reach and familiarity across borders, religions and ethnicities, there has been a tremendous increase in couples who opt for it. Anticipating the current demand, almost 30 years back, Dr. Gautam Allahbadia, a senior IVF Consultant initiated the country rsquo s first budget IVF Centre Deccan IVF later renamed Rotunda The Center for Human Reproduction at Parel, Mumbai to help underprivileged infertile couples. Succeeding his mother rsquo s dying wish to help the not so fortunate and help babies find their way into this world irrespective of economic disparity, and giving infertile couples the boon of parenthood, Dr Gautam Allahbadia has since helped thousands of couples. He being a cancer survivor himself, the driver rsquo s seat at Rotunda CHR has now been taken by his wife Dr Swati Allahbadia www.iwannagetpregnant.com and his daughter Dr Akanksha Allahbadia Gupta who is also an IVF specialist. For couples who have battled infertility for years and have faced the hard times of not able to bear a child, do understand the blessing that IVF has been for them. There is emotional upheaval for couples and their immediate families once they are diagnosed with infertility. This directly affects the health and mental state of a person. It is not very easy to understand how a childless couple would react and behave in a social system. IVF has been that nbsp calming solution for such couples to achieve parenthood and get that happiness in their lives. Dr Gautam Allahbadia, a leading medical professional in Reproductive Endocrinology and IVF has been providing fertility solutions to couples across the globe. Dr. Gautam Allahbadia is recognized for his expertise in Ultrasound Guided Embryo transfers and for helping out women with low AMH with his pioneering work with Minimal Stimulation IVF IVF Lite , in South East Asia.

With so many feathers added to his hat and accolades he has achieved he has been responsible for completing over 9000 families in six continents. ldquo IVF is one of the best treatments for couples who cannot conceive for many different reasons. Over the past years, pregnancy rates associated with IVF have been twice as high when compared to early days. When we compare it to other modalities, IVF is more cost effective and efficient in achieving pregnancy. rdquo says the doctor, highlighting how IVF has been useful. Avowedly a religious man, Dr. Gautam Allahbadia extends is medical prowess and acquired knowledge to help both men and women overcome infertility. Having practiced in both India amp UAE, he has helped set up over 36 Medical establishments and trained staff both medical amp para medical, from scratch to successful practitioners of the art now.

Talking about it he reasserts Albert Einstein rsquo s famous quotation, ldquo It is every man rsquo s obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it. rdquo On questioning about the future of assisted reproduction and how will he make it accessible to the unprivileged, Dr. Gautam Allahbadia rsquo s firm resolute was indeed, inspiring. ldquo I will have my retirement home cum hospital for the visiting doctors in the same premises in a really rural part of India where medical help is difficult. Besides treating the poor in this 100 not for profit charitable hospital which he wants to run from his family owned Hari Charitable Trust, he also wants to train the local staff as para medicals. If we are successful in the first stand alone unit, I want to help open three four more identical units in rural communities over the next 2 3 years. rdquo nbsp Sharing his plans for future in great lengths, it seems that there rsquo s certainly nothing stopping him. Talking about his years in practice, the doctor feels honored to have successfully walked the journey of pregnancy with his patients.

Streitpunkt Schulferienbeginn


  Einer der Streitpunkte bei den Verhandlungen zwischen Landerregierungen und Kanzleramt uber einen Corona-Plan bis Januar wird am Mittwoch der Schulferienbeginn im Dezember werden. In Baden-Wurttemberg wie in einigen anderen Landern ist bislang der letzte Schultag der 22. Dezember (Dienstag). Wenn die Schuler bereits am 18. (Freitag) oder 19. Dezember (Samstag) in die Ferien entlassen wurden, hatten sie bis Heiligabend eine Strecke von funf bis sechs Tagen. Diese konnte nach Ansicht der meisten Ministerprasidenten nutzen, um Kontakte zu minimieren.


  Ungeklart ist bislang aber, wie der Ausfall zusatzlicher Tage kompensiert werden und wie eine Notbetreuung am 21. und 22. Dezember sichergestellt werden kann. Eigentlich hatten die Winterferien am 23. Dezember begonnen.


  Kultusministerin Eisenmann sagte zu, die Beschlusse von Bund und Landern umzusetzen. Sie bleibe aber bei ihren Bedenken, dass eine Verlangerung organisatorische Fragen auslosen und zahlreiche Eltern vor Betreuungsprobleme stellen konne. Statt einer landesweiten Regelung konnten einzelne Schulen die Weihnachtsferien dieses Jahr durch bewegliche Ferientage verlangern. In Baden- Wurttemberg gibt es in diesem Schuljahr vier bewegliche Ferientage.

 I actually bought this product a few weeks ago (thanks, Black Friday) and being able to store all my games on one drive, and switch the cable between PS4 and PS5 and have it all work, has been a godsend.

Myreon Jones ended last season with a few mixed performances. The then- sophomore struggled in two of Penn State's last three games and couldn't find the offensive punch that he provided earlier in the season when he was the team's best perimeter shooter and one of its best scorers.
 Of course, his struggles came after missing nearly four weeks due to an undisclosed illness that left him struggling to find his footing in the waning games of the season.
 Now -- after eight months away from game action -- Jones is in a position to be the Nittany Lions' leading scorer as they try to do what last year's team never had the chance to do -- make the NCAA Tournament.
 Jones entered last year's final stretch as a key piece of a five-game winning streak that stretched to eight in his absence before the team began to fall apart. Without the guard, Penn State became too reliant on star leading scorer Lamar Stevens and began to run out of steam. By the time Jones returned, the momentum was lost and he still had to work his way into shape. Then-head coach Pat Chambers saw the promise his team once had with Jones after a loss to Michigan State in early March.
 "We haven't had Myreon Jones for a long time," Chambers said after the loss last season. "He's just getting back. He was very rusty against Iowa. He was very good in the first half, just okay in the second half (against Michigan State) because of his wind. But once we get him back to full strength, I think it's full steam ahead."

Sarah Nurse's new blue hockey jersey was paid for by a company. She wants to know when she can wear it in a game.
 Amid a spate of recent sponsorship announcements by the Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association comes the corporate branding of a team.
 PWHPA players based in Toronto are now Team Sonnet.
 The digital home and auto insurance company has made "a significant six-figure commitment" to the PWHPA, according to Sonnet marketing vice-president Brian Long.
 "They don't own them, but they will be branded as Team Sonnet," PWHPA operations consultant Jayna Hefford told The Canadian Press.
 "Every team this season will be branded."
 PWHPA players are centralized in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Minneapolis and Hudson, N.H., training hubs with 25 players per roster.
 Among them are Canadian Olympians Marie-Philip Poulin, Natalie Spooner and Nurse, as well as American counterparts Kendall Coyne Schofield and Hilary Knight.
 Roughly 180 players, including Canadian and American national-team players, formed the PWHPA in the wake of the Canadian Women's Hockey League folding in 2019.
 Their goal is a league that pays them enough to be full-time professional players with the same competitive, medical and insurance supports the male pros get.
 The players refuse to join the U.S.-based NWHL, which has expanded into Canada this season with the Toronto Six. The NWHL announced Wednesday its sixth season will run in a bubble with no fans in Lake Placid, N.Y., Jan. 23 to Feb. 5.
 The PWHPA ran a series of showcase tournaments and exhibition games in 2019-20 under the banner of the "Dream Gap Tour."
 The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed a second tour. Hefford says up to seven tournaments are in the works for February and March.
 "We're trying to work with NHL partners in each market so those conversations are happening," Hefford said.
 "One thing we're running into is waiting on the NHL schedule. It's hard for a club to commit to anything, it's hard for us to secure the ice time and venues we want to be in."
 Hefford has stated the best way for a women's pro hockey league to succeed is to align with the NHL in some way.
 Sonnet's announcement Wednesday follows a $1-million Secret deodorant sponsorship unveiled last month. The PWHPA declared it the most lucrative deal in women's pro hockey history.
 Canadian Tire came on board last week with discounts and supplies to defray player and league costs.
 In a span of two days earlier this month, Tim Hortons launched the sale of Poulin and Nurse Barbie dolls to raise money for female hockey and the vintner Noble Estates said it would provide championship bubbly to the PWHPA.
 Corporate investment when current COVID-19 restrictions across Canada barely allow the PWHPA players to practise is for Nurse both a validation of her hockey dreams and a signal to the NHL that a WNHL would have corporate legs to stand on.
 "We haven't had big announcements like this in our sport ever," said the 25-year-old forward from Hamilton.
 "I think the NHL, which is ultimately a business, sees things like that and they see us going out and getting our own sponsorships and creating these partnerships by ourselves. It's that confidence that this can stand on two legs. It may just need a little bit of a push."
 Sonnet is a corporate partner of the NHL Players' Association, which is a PWHPA supporter.
 "We believe that it's all about the players right? The players are the ones that make this all happen," Long said.
 "As we got to the evolution of that campaign and to getting to the next round, it was sort of saying, 'well, we're not including the whole community here.'"
 Hefford was incorporated in Sonnet commercials this year alongside NHL alumni Doug Gilmour and Mario Tremblay and current NHLers Morgan Rielly, Zach Hyman and Frédérik Gauthier.
 "Seeing Jayna in those initial spots was the start of what the bigger conversations were going to be," Long said.
 "That's what sort of led us to now, obviously working with them in this series and sponsoring a team."
 Sonnet's commitment is for a 2021 Dream Gap Tour with the potential to continue the relationship, Long said.
 "Our plans are not to just do this as a one off and go somewhere else," he said. "Ultimately, we would like to see this grow."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 25, 2020.

Bryan Darst stared at concrete walls while sitting on a cot inside a facility he was all too familiar with. His mind raced, drowning out the noise made from dozens of inmates around him. He knew what he wanted; he’d even had it before, briefly. But he needed a way to keep it. He needed a way to stay sober and an “insurance policy” from Athens County Prosecutor Keller Blackburn provided that.
 Before the age of 30, Darst has been in and out of jail on a variety of charges related to his drug addiction. It had become the norm of a life he no longer wanted to lead. Word spread that a new program hosted by the Athens County Prosecutor’s Office included an opiate-blocking treatment called Vivitrol — a program that has since been instrumental in reducing the five- year, age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths in Ohio to one of the lowest in the state.
 “I had it in my head that I was done with drugs and I saw that Vivitrol blocked opiates without any kind of mind- or mood-altering chemical with it … Not like suboxone,” Darst said.
 Suboxone is another form of medically-assisted treatment that has been criticized because of its tendency to also be misused.
 “(Suboxone) is really a loophole and people I knew would just end up using that as their drug of choice. I didn’t want that,” he added.
 Now 33 and living in Athens, Darst wanted something he knew would work. He wanted a real chance at lasting sobriety. He wanted Vivitrol.
 Working with Athens County Assistant Prosecutor Meg Saunders, Darst came to an agreement that would see him plead guilty to criminal charges such as forgery, breaking and entering and stealing checks; crimes he committed to fuel his drug habit; charges that had him incarcerated in the Southeastern Ohio Regional Jail and staring at concrete walls.
 With seven years in prison hanging over his head, Darst was allowed to enter the Vivitrol program for that chance of sobriety he desperately wanted.
 But this isn’t a fairy tale and happy endings are not just written. There were obstacles and requirements to Darst’s “happily ever after.”
 On the day that Darst was in court to enter into the plea agreement, he was accused of taking cigarettes from his daughter’s diaper bag.
 “I was in handcuffs and someone said that when I went to give my daughter a kiss that I snagged a pack of cigarettes. The court officer put me against the wall, searched me and couldn’t find them. Then Meg said that for that stupid stunt, I couldn’t sign the plea agreement that day and I was sent back to jail,” Darst said.
 For the record, Darst was asked if he took the cigarettes.
 “Yes. Yes, I did.”
 “It wasn’t worth it,” he continued. “I couldn’t come back for a couple of weeks to sign the agreement but at least I knew they were serious about (the Vivitrol) program.”
 Vivitrol requires the client to be without drugs in their system for at least 10 days. As it blocks the effects of opiates on the brain, it can also cause illness if drugs are in the body at the time. Those still craving that “fix” for drugs have said Vivitrol removed that feeling immediately. For Darst — already sober while in jail — the shot of Vivitrol had no discernable effect on him when administered. But it was what it represented that mattered most to him.
 “Vivitrol was my insurance policy. If going to my recovery meetings wasn’t working, talking to my sponsor wasn’t working, doing all the things I was supposed to wouldn’t work, I’d always have the Vivitrol to fall back on because I knew that even if I did use, I wouldn’t feel the effects,” he said. “It was my failsafe. If all else fails, that wouldn’t.”
 Darst explained that recovery is difficult for a number of reasons and is different for everyone. He said some have trouble getting through the first day. Some struggle to get to 30 days sober or 60 or 90 days because the process requires the rearranging of habits and comforts. Rather than deal with the feelings that come with withdrawal or that come with the stressors of life, it’s sometimes easier for the person to relapse back to coping mechanisms that include the misuse of drugs. Darst did not experience that desire to use again and credits Vivitrol with helping him not think that way.
 Darst immersed himself in the cognitive behavior therapy portion of the program and continued to take his monthly shot of Vivitrol. He relied on the prosecutor’s office to keep track of his progress while he focused on his recovery day-by-day.
 In June 2017, Darst graduated from the Vivitrol program. He completed his sentenced community control in September of 2018 and, as of this writing, Darst has been sober for nearly five years.
 “I built such a good relationship with the prosecutor’s office. It benefitted me tremendously,” he said.
 Included in those benefits was a recommendation (and encouragement) from administrators of the program to begin work as peer support with Integrated Services. Darst now works with Mike’s Bridge House where he helps guide others through the recovery process. He’s also been featured in TedX talks and spoke at one of Vivitrol’s graduation ceremonies.
 “The prosecutor’s office believed I could do this. I didn’t have a lot of hope for myself but they pushed me along and gave me the courage to believe I could do this too,” he said.
 Instead of concrete walls surrounding him, Darst uses his experience to help others avoid that environment.
 “It has its good days and its bad days. It’s awesome to see guys grow in recovery and achieve their goals. I get a lot more reward out of seeing others progress in their recovery that I do myself,” Darst said.
 Addiction, however, is still very real in Darst’s life. At the time of this interview, Darst had recently experienced the death of a former client. His voice shook slightly and his breath quivered when he recounted the story.
 “He’d just left last week … and he died on Saturday. It sucks. I tell the guys we’re lucky to have made it out alive,” he said.
 Darst tries to keep an eye on the light rather than the dark.
 “[I]t’s nice to see people get their families back and get to see their kids again, become fathers, become everything they want to be,” he said.
 He keeps that same attitude towards himself.
 “I use that saying that my worst day in recover is still better than my best day getting high,” he said. “I went fishing all day and didn’t catch a fish but I was still happy. We recently lost someone and it’s a hard thing to deal with but we have to share the message that it doesn’t have to end like that.”
 “Bryan Darst is an example that anyone at any point can be saved. He has been to prison. He has fallen on tough times. He was down and out and he took an opportunity to participate in our Vivitrol program and turned his life around,” said Athens County Prosecutor Keller Blackburn.
 Vivitrol program administrators Reuben Kittle and Becky Filar make it a point to keep an open-door policy for anyone that needs to speak or just wants to vent about their frustrations in recovery or otherwise. Darst said he often takes advantage of the opportunity.
 “I’ve said it a million times, I couldn’t be more grateful, thankful, appreciative of everything the prosecutor’s office has done for me and the opportunities they gave me to change my life. I hope I can continue to give back to the community and help any way that I can.”

“He preached as a dying man to dying men.” Rev. John Burns’ congregation in Lawrence, MA, knew he was suffering from a fatal kidney disease and was in his last days on earth. “As the taper of life grew shorter, he preached the gospel with all the grace of novelty.”
 Captain Burns had survived Gettysburg and 27 other blood-soaked battles in the Civil War. Sickened by the sights of war, he became a minister “to make the world a better place.” But due to the kidney disease, he had just six years in the pulpit before feeling the sting of death.
 We celebrate Thanksgiving in all the diverse stings of life as well as death—and even in the grip of a viral plague. Whatever your situation may be this year, the Bible instructs us to “give thanks in all circumstances.”
 If mankind disappoints us, take heart in “the beauty of the earth and the glory of the skies…Lord of all, to thee we raise a hymn of grateful praise.” But the purest form of gratitude is forged in the crucible of adversity.
 James and Elizabeth Burns lost their two children to a frontier fever in the fall of 1805. Jane, age 3, died on Sept. 25 and her brother Alexander, 1, ten days later. An uncle in the north of Ireland wrote a stoic letter of condolences to the young couple.
 “I am sorry to hear of the deaths of your children, but still I hope that you will submit to the Lord’s will and be thankful for every dispensation of his providence that He is pleased to send your way, that is to say the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord.”
 An ancestral cousin suffered similar grief, illness taking his daughter and granddaughter, both named Nancy. Yet his gratitude to God was strong enough to break through this bleak blanket of sorrow.
 He wrote, “The all-wise giver of every good bestows on his unworthy subjects the necessities and comforts of life, both spiritual and temporal. I feel at times that I should blush at my ingratitude.”
 Another couple with six children living in humble circumstances focused on the basics. “We thank God that we always have plenty to eat and clothes to wear. We are as happy and content as can be expected.”
 David Acheson, a neighbor in both Ireland and America, expressed gratitude to his parents for his upbringing. “When I reflect on the care you bestowed upon me, the pains you took to instruct my youth in virtuous things, I wonder how it is possible for children to ever be ungrateful to their parents.”
 Just a step beyond gratitude lies the need and opportunity for sharing. This need was clearly seen by a missionary cousin serving in India.
 “Righteousness has exalted our nation. God’s commands for us to better the world’s conditions are unmistakable. No man can live merely for himself nor can a nation.”
 Through any haze of hardship burns a ray of sunshine. But its promise will only be captured if we reflect on our bonds of kinship and friendship and both where we are and what we have.
 As a God-fearing nation, we rest on a bedrock of belief as well as a bountiful harvest. May we bow our heads and give thanks to our Creator and provider. May we never need to blush at our ingratitude. And may we instruct our youth in virtuous things.
  _James F. Burns is an Ohio native and retired professor at the University of Florida._

C’est ce que je souhaitais, en tout cas. J’adore la réalisation. C’est peut- être un peu vaniteux de ma part, mais j’aime vraiment l’esprit de collaboration qu’amène un tournage. Et, surtout, travailler avec les acteurs. Quand j’étais jeune, je voulais d’ailleurs devenir comédien, comme tout le monde, mais je ne décrochais jamais de rôles. Avec un ami, j’ai alors commencé à écrire des trucs dans lesquels nous pouvions jouer. Au fil des ans, il est devenu évident que j’avais beaucoup plus à offrir en tant que scénariste qu’à titre d’acteur. L’écriture est devenue mon centre d’intérêt principal. J’ai aussi commencé à faire de la mise en scène au théâtre et j’ai aimé ça. Quand j’ai écrit l’émission pilote de _Six Feet Under_ et qu’on m’a demandé à qui je pensais pour le réaliser, j’ai dit : moi ! Et ils m’ont laissé faire ! J’étais terrifié, mais je crois que ça s’est bien passé finalement.

Their daring voyage across the Atlantic had been rocked by violent storms that damaged and nearly crippled their vessel. As they came ashore, the Pilgrims knelt to thank God for bringing them to dry land. Unfortunately, many would not survive the first winter. But with the help of Native American neighbors, the Pilgrims learned to build a new life on the American continent.

Alabama coach Nick Saban has tested positive for COVID-19 and is showing symptoms from the coronavirus, according to the program. This revelation comes three days before the No. 1 Crimson Tide are scheduled to play No. 22 Auburn in their annual Iron Bowl rivalry game that will be featured as the SEC on CBS Game of the Week.
 "This morning we received notification that Coach Saban tested positive for COVID-19. He has very mild symptoms, so this test will not be categorized as a potential false positive. He will follow all appropriate guidelines and isolate at home," the program said in a statement.
 This is the second time this season that Saban has tested positive for COVID-19. He previously tested positive before Alabama's game against Georgia but was asymptomatic. Saban was eventually cleared to coach the game against the Bulldogs after testing negative three times, indicating the initial test was likely a false positive.
 Alabama's statement suggests things will be different this time around, which means the Crimson Tide will be coached from the sideline by someone other than Saban as they seek revenge Saturday for last year's loss to Auburn. The program's succession plan before the Georgia game called for offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian to take an elevated role while Saban was out after testing positive for COVID-19.

Acceptable reasons for challenging the declared results of an election include misconduct on the part of election boards or those participating in the canvass, someone who was elected being ineligible for office, or bribes.
 There is, however, one catch-all that could give challengers access to the courts: claims of “illegal votes.’’ That has been one of the president’s main claim that the results were changed by illegal ballots.
 Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani last week said he intends to file suit in Arizona along with other states. But there has been nothing brought to court so far.
 “Any legal challenges that are going to come, those go through the courts,’’ Ducey said Tuesday. But he said that the formal certification will happen as scheduled.
 Any post-canvass lawsuit would have to be resolved quickly.
 Federal law requires any recounts or legal challenges in presidential races to be completed by Dec. 8, with the Electoral College votes cast six days later.
 Meanwhile, attorneys for the Trump campaign put out a statement Tuesday saying that the Arizona Legislature is going to have a public hearing this coming Monday on the 2020 election.
 “There were serious irregularities, we have proof of fraud in a number of states, and it is important for all Americans to have faith in our electoral process,’’ said Jenna Ellis, the campaign senior legal advisor and personal attorney to the president. And she said the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures the sole authority to select their representatives to the Electoral College, protecting against voter fraud and election manipulation.
 Only thing is, neither House Speaker Rusty Bowers nor Senate President Karen Fann has authorized such a hearing. And without their permission, any meeting of lawmakers is just people coming together with no real power.
 The information being put out by Ellis may have come from Finchem who has acknowledged being in contact with the lawyers in the campaign. In fact, he tried to get permission for the House Federalism Committee to have a hearing this week only to have that request refused by Bowers.
 Finchem did not immediately return calls on Tuesday.
 Ellis also said there will be hearings in Pennsylvania and Michigan.

“Masks are not effective,” Condon said. “Why don’t we recommend people take zinc, which is a strong antiviral? Or vitamin C, which helps the immune system, or vitamin D? If people still develop it, give them hydroxychloroquine. We can do that instead of pushing masks and this tyranny you’re bringing down on us.”
 Several Nebraska cities, including Omaha, Lincoln, Ralston, Gretna, Hastings and Beatrice, have now passed mask mandates, many in the last week. The Papillion Board of Health is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss a mask mandate.
 Like Omaha, Gretna and Ralston, La Vista’s mandate does not require masks in places where people can maintain 6 feet of distance from one another or for people who are seeking government services or seated at a bar or restaurant, among other exceptions.

“Compared to the small town of Canton, they are probably going to blow my eardrums out,” Knapp said. “I love loud atmospheres. I can’t wait to be a part of that and take in the amazing fan base Canton has.”
 While he is an all-state player on the field, Knapp knows that how he acts as a person is also a big part of why Penn State liked him.
 “I have developed quite a bit as a player,” Knapp said. “Coach Bowen and the entire Penn State staff preached on character.
 Luckily for me I fit that mold with character. I hope to prove they made the right choice taking a shot on me to become not only a great football player, but a great person and man after going through my career at Penn State University.”
 There isn’t one thing in particular for Knapp to work on. He just wants to keep getting better.
 “Everything,” Knapp said of things to work on. “Once I get there and to that level and see what they want to work on I will. I pride myself on being coachable. I will do everything to be the best player and person I can be.”
 Knapp knows that there is a lot of work to be done, and that he may not get a chance to contribute right away. He’s willing to put in the work, wait his turn and do anything they ask him to do.
 “I am not one to be selfish and feed me the ball,” Knapp said. “If my team is winning and I am contributing at the end of the day winning is what is important. If coach Bowen wants me to run a deep route, or block my butt off, I’ll do what it takes to get that W.
 “Any opportunity I am presented I will take every opportunity. Whether they want me to block on a kick return or run down on a kick off. Whatever they think is best is what I’m going to be doing.”
 Knapp doesn’t want to get ahead of himself, but he knows that if the chance comes to step on the field for the Nittany Lions, it will be an amazing moment.
 “It’s a dream come true,” Knapp said. “I try not to think too far ahead, because next thing you know you are nerved up. When, and if, that moment comes that will probably be one of the greatest moments in my life.”
 And, Knapp can’t wait to see how his hometown will react if he gets on the field in Happy Valley.
 “That’s something I can’t wait for that day when and if it happens,” Knapp said. “I love this community. Despite the struggle of playing for a small school, I love every minute of it. Representing this town I take a lot of pride in.”
 It still isn’t sinking in yet for Knapp that he is going to be a Nittany Lions football player.
 “To be 100% honest no,” Knapp said of if it has sunk in. “Sometimes it takes a couple days to let things sink in. I will get there. I worked hard to do my best to do everything I can to make myself the best version of myself. I have to try and grasp the fact that my dream has come true and this is actually happening.”
 Knapp hopes that seven year old kids in the future see him playing for the Nittany Lions and realize that those crazy dreams can come true.
 “If there is one thing I want to be taken from this, your dreams can come true with hard work,” Knapp said. “There are a lot of bright spots in Canton, a lot of solid kids trying to get their shots.”

First and foremost, you must consider whether to ask about college admission, or not. Bear in mind that many students have already submitted early applications and at Thanksgiving could be waiting on pins and needles for a decision. Later in December they might have just received that decision and be dealing with disappointment. You will not automatically know where a student is in the process, or if they want to discuss it, so ask. Before you launch into a slew of college-related questions, simply ask if they are up to talking about their college applications or if they would prefer another topic. Honor their choice. They might rather discuss their sports season, robotics project, volunteer role, or just their favorite TikTok video.

Tlaib from her assigned committees, just as the House Republicans did when they stripped Rep. Steve King of his committee assignments after he made troubling comments defending white supremacists. Bigotry of any kind cannot be tolerated in Congress, and the blatant anti- Semitic and anti-Israel sentiments espoused by Rep. Tlaib must be promptly denounced by Congressional leaders and her House colleagues,” added Weiss.

Forbes Leland, 79, of Annapolis MD, passed away on November 4, 2020. Often referred to as a gentle giant, Forbes, at nearly 6'8" was clearly larger than life. Even at an early age, Forbes had a keen eye, instinctively knowing what he wanted. And it was usually off the beaten path. After the death of his grandparents, he was asked if he would like a momento. He chose two ship models found in a musty back room, leaving relatives scratching their heads. One is now featured in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston as a rare 1844 glass ship. The other is in the Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis. Growing up in Beverly MA, Forbes was an avid sailor, soloing his 43' cutter-rigged sloop Jade on the East coast. A natural musician, he drummed as a teenager with the Herbie Sulkin Band and added flute and sax to the Summer Street Jazz Band at the Folkway in Peterborough NH. He was on the Board of the Annapolis Symphony and taught "The History of Jazz" with long waiting lists. Forbes was foremost an environmentalist. He started VAL Construction with friends, renovated the Hancock Inn, built his own sustainable house in Hancock, helped design the NH Audubon headquarters, and established Sustainable Building Systems. In the 1970's he tried to protect Willard Pond in Antrim NH from being poisoned by rotenone, and spearheaded regulation preventing motorized boats from polluting the peace. Due to his grandmother Elsa Tudor's bequeathment and largely to Forbes's tireless perseverance and dedication, the area around this lake is now totally protected from development and has become NH Audubon's largest Sanctuary. He worked as an agent for the NH Forest Society and was on the NH Audubon Board. Forbes will be missed for his dry and quirky sense of humor, captivating (self-deprecating) stories, amusingly dramatic flair, broad intellect and stimulating conversations, deep respect for women, diversity and the Earth, and especially for his kind, caring and generous heart. His loving memory lives on with his two sisters, Lysa Leland and Daphne L. Borden, his nephew Rob Borden and wife Jenny, their two sons, Benjamin and Sawyer, and a multitude of relatives and friends. His parents, Phyllis and Tudor Leland, and Marilyn Eason, his beloved partner, predeceased him. Contributions can be made to the New Hampshire Audubon Society (for land protection), McLane Center, 84 Silk Farm Road, Concord, NH 03301.
