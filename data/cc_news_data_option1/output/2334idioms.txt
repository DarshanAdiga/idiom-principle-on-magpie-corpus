What to make of the imbroglio around Wichita State University president Jay Golden?
   
 To recap, presidential daughter Ivanka Trump was briefly invited to deliver a virtual commencement speech to graduates of WSU Tech. After an outcry from students and staff, lent urgency by national protests against racist policy, Golden rescinded the younger Trump's invitation.
   
 The outcry from high-profile fundraisers and supporters of the university was immediate, with those connected to Koch Industries and Pizza Hut voicing their displeasure. Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo weighed in, also criticizing the decision.
   
 Some vociferous voices called for Golden's removal.
   
 But after a lengthy meeting, the Kansas Board of Regents declined to do so. They and Golden issued separate statements supporting free speech, along with diversity and inclusion. Koch voiced displeasure but said it would continue funding the commitments it made to the school.
   
 Here's the thing: Golden made the right call. Universities ultimately serve students, not donors. If students raise their voices in calling for change, higher education institutions should listen. Even those with extravagant wealth, such as the Koch family, don't get to call the shots -- unless they choose to open their own university (although perhaps we shouldn't be giving them ideas).
   
 Let's also dispense with the notion that disinviting Ivanka Trump had anything to do with freedom of speech or discussion. That's nonsense.
   
 Her remarks were released to the public soon after the controversy, and they're viewable by anyone with an internet connection. She or her father have abundant opportunity to reach the public through social media and public appearances. They both have arguably more opportunity to speak and be heard than the vast majority of Americans.
   
 No, what students and staff objected to was connecting Wichita State to that of a U.S. president with a history of racially charged statements and his daughter, whose prime qualification for giving a public speech is genetic.
   
 There's no reason that WSU should lift them up if it chooses not to.
   
 Yes, the college and its president may still face consequences. But standing on principle, even if inconvenient, should be noted. Inviting the speech in the first place was likely a mistake. Making it right took courage and a willingness to stand up to powerful interests. That's worthy of praise, not condemnation.

Namely, if you need to have multiple users with access to edit a particular node of a given type but without them necessarily having access to edit others of the same type. In other words, the next great article should be editable by Laura and Glenn but not by their colleagues. However, out of the box, users of a particular role can be masters either of their own content or of all content of a certain type. So this is not immediately possible.

With its commitment to a transition to green energy, the Taiwanese market presents significant opportunities for international renewable energy companies. Forecasters predict that Taiwan will become the second-largest offshore wind farm market in Asia in the next 10 years, and geothermal heat power also has enormous potential, given Taiwan’s location on the Pacific "ring of fire," known for high seismological activity. Companies already set to capitalize on this momentum include Sweden’s Climeon, which this month finalized a geothermal heat power order worth $4.2 million, and Denmark’s Orsted, which owns a 35% stake in the $627 million Formosa 1 wind complex off the coast of west Taiwan.

I hope I have convinced you by now _why_ you should use transactional email. But doing it is one thing, actually using it is even more important. Because there’s a fine line between becoming a spammer or being regarded as company that sends useful emails, even if it is a lot. And the perfect way of measuring success is by analyzing what the receiver is doing with it. Did he come back to the site? Did she purchase what you recommended? Or did your email just go straight to the trash bin? Did your email even make it all the way to their inbox?

But the resumption comes as the federal prison has struggled to combat the coronavirus pandemic behind bars, including at least one death at USP Terre Haute, where they will take place. One inmate there has died from COVID-19.
 The inmates who will be executed are: Danny Lee, who was convicted of killing a family of three, including an 8-year-old; Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped and murdered a 16-year-old girl and killed an 80-year-old woman; Dustin Lee Honken, who killed five people, including two children; and Keith Dwayne Nelson, who kidnapped a 10-year-old girl who was rollerblading in front of her home and raped her in a forest behind a church before strangling the young girl to death with a wire.
 Three of the executions — for Lee, Purkley and Honken — are scheduled days apart beginning July 13. Nelson's execution is scheduled for Aug. 28. The Justice Department said additional executions will be set at a later date.
 Executions on the federal level have been rare and the government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988 — most recently in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier. Though there hasn’t been a federal execution since 2003, the Justice Department has continued to approve death penalty prosecutions and federal courts have sentenced defendants to death.
 In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, President Barack Obama directed the Justice Department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs.
 The attorney general said last July that the Obama-era review had been completed, clearing the way for executions to resume. He approved a new procedure for lethal injections that replaces the three-drug combination previously used in federal executions with one drug, pentobarbital. This is similar to the procedure used in several states, including Georgia, Missouri and Texas, but not all.

Grant applications must be submitted by a Manistee County government entity, though some may submit applications on behalf of other non-governmental organizations.      While the Little River Casino Resort was closed during part of the the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been concerns that grant money may dry up for future distribution cycles. Jeff Dontz, revenue board vice-chair, previously told the News Advocate that the impacts were "certain to affect future grant requests."   "The question is by how much and none of us know," he had said.   In light of the casino's financial loss, the revenue sharing board had voted to temporarily postpone the next grant distribution cycle until December.   "It's an assist to help them through this unique time," Dontz previously said. "The till will still be collecting. It's just a matter that we will not have that money in this house at that time."      The funding amount approved for grants varies from year to year.   For example, the board approved grant requests totaling $225,134 this time last year and in the December 2013 grant cycle, more than $1.4 million was distributed.      More than $32 million in grants have been awarded since the board began in 1999.

Myth: Newsletters _Must_ Be Short and Sweet

Newsom, who came to Waverly 27 years ago for the job now holds, said that as a black man, he lives in a different world, one where he has to make decisions and choices to protect his life.
 “One of the things that my mother said to me — as we have had numerous conversations — my grandmother came from the South, migrated to the North for a better life. My grandmother was in the heart of the Civil Rights Movement,” he continued. “She worked to make life better for my mother and her siblings and to fight the sin of racism. She did everything she could to prepare my mother and her siblings how to carry themselves so that they could be safe.
 “My mother said for 50 years now — I’m 50 years old — she’s worried about me just like my grandmother worried about her. For 50 years, my mother has worried about me. She’s not worried about the choices and decisions I was going to make. She worried about the sin of racism and what that meant in terms of me being a black man. She worried about me, and still, to this day, she’ll tell you, she’s still worried about me.”
 Newsom said as parents of biracial children, both he and his wife share his ancestors’ concern to prepare their children on “how to handle the evils of this world.”
 “They are very proud of their history and their heritage, both their African- American heritage and their German heritage,” he said. “We take full pride in that.
 “All three of the boys, they’re first names and their middle names have both their German heritage and their African-American heritage. We wanted them to be proud of who they were, so they knew who they were. They never had to feel like they had to choose or make a decision or fit in, that they could be who they were, and most importantly, is to be a child of God first. We taught all of the boys, ‘God loves you for who you are.’ The Bible says, ‘Come as you are.’ That’s how we have empowered and raised our children.”
 Newsom, who grew up Baptist, went to a Catholic school, earned his college degree from a Lutheran college and now works at another college of the same denomination, said integrating spirituality into the vigil was important to him.
 “The spiritual part is what my foundation is,” he said. “I really felt like when speaking to Pastor Arthur about visiting with the other clergy in the community and getting our communities together from a standpoint of our clergy, I think that is part of that healing process, that we can start praying about change, and acting upon that with some guidance.”
 He said he agreed to speak at the vigil because change is needed not just in the world but also in Waverly.
 “With me being in this community for 27 years, I felt it was very important for me to do what I could do so that we as a community can pay our respects for all of those lives that’s been lost because of senseless behaviors and attitudes.”
 If meaningful change were to happen, he added, the events that led to the protests cannot be ignored.
 “We have to keep this in front of us,” he said. “We can’t wish this away. This is not going to go away. We can see from the weeks and weeks and weeks of what we’ve seen in terms of the protests — the non-violent protests — because no one wants to be a month down the road and act like this never, ever happened.
 “This has to be in front of us and in front of each step we take daily as a reminder of what our personal, individual jobs are and making this world a better place for our children, our future leaders. If we’re going to do that, we’re all going to have to be committed to change. We have to have to be committed to honest change, true change.”
 Newsome said he is pleased with the new law signed by the governor, which reforms police practices, emphasizes de-escalation and training.
 “With that reform, every individual also has to make their own personal reforms of what they believe in and what’s in their heart,” he said. “It’s been the decision and the choice of individuals that has harmed lives. We all have to look in the mirror and look at ourselves and ask what personal reforms do we need to make. I’m definitely pleased with the reform that we see happening in our own state of Iowa and in our country as well.”

The Oscars ceremony date was the big lingering unknown, however. The organization's leadership has acknowledged all along that the situation was fluid and that everything was on the table. Now, Oscars nominations will be announced on March 15 and the nominees luncheon will be on April 15.
 Still, many decisions need to be made. Academy leadership has not yet addressed the format of the show and whether it will be virtual or in-person. Further, the future eligibility of films for the 94th Oscars and that show date will be announced later.
 The Oscars have been postponed before, but never this far in advance. The ceremony was pushed back a week because of disastrous flooding in Los Angeles in 1938. In 1968, it was delayed two days following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And in 1981, it was put off for 24 hours after President Ronald Reagan was shot in Washington D.C. The 1981 decision was made four hours before the broadcast was scheduled to begin.
 The eligibility window was extended beyond 12 months once before -- in advance of the 6th Academy Awards in 1934.
 Other entertainment industry awards shows are also in flux. The 74th Tony Awards, originally set for June 7, has been postponed indefinitely. But the 72nd Emmy Awards is still holding onto Sept. 20. The 78th Golden Globes does not yet have a date.
 Even as the country begins to "open up," studios are still making decisions to delay releases. Just Friday, Warner Bros. announced that it was pushing back what was supposed to be the first major movie in theaters, Christopher Nolan's "Tenet," by two weeks.
