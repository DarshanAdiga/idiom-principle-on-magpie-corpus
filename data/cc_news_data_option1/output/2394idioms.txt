FRAMINGHAM - A Medway man is facing drug charges after a traffic stop on Wednesday, authorities said.
 Police arrested Christopher Mullin, 62, after they pulled him over on Cochituate Road (Rte. 30), police said.
 Police pulled Mullin over for driving erratically near the Target store at 400 Cochituate Road. They discovered his license had been suspended.

 Police arrested Mullin, of 14 Sanford St., and charged him with three counts of possession of a Class E substance; operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs; driving to endanger; and driving with a suspended license, police said.
 After his arraignment Thursday in Framingham District Court, Mullin was released without bail but ordered not to drive. He is due back in court on July 18 for a pretrial conference.

AMSTERDAM (AP) — The 17th century has gone down in Dutch history as the Golden Age, when unprecedented trading wealth helped fund the likes of artists Rembrandt van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer.
 But the grim flip side of the prosperity — fortunes generated by seafaring traders, slavery and iron-fisted colonial rulers — is being brought into sharp focus amid global protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd.
 Activists spurred by the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States are seeking to shed more light on the Dutch colonial past and tackle what they call ingrained racism and discrimination in the Netherlands, a nation that was once known as a beacon of tolerance.
 The latest target of activists is a statue of a top officer of the Dutch East India Company who in the 17th century founded the city that is now Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. Protests calling for the removal of the statue of Jan Pieterszoon Coen and a counter-demonstration supporting it are planned for Friday evening.
 Honored since the late 19th century as a colonial ruler and leading light in the Dutch East India Company trading powerhouse, Coen also is reviled as the “butcher of Banda” for a bloody 1621 assault on a group of islands in order to secure a monopoly on spices grown there. Thousands of island inhabitants were killed.
 “He is a murderer, and we shouldn’t … have murderers on a statue. That’s not done,” Marisella de Cuba, one of the protest organizers, said.

"Having less blood and oxygen flowing to your muscles is like trying to water your garden with a leaking hose," Smith explained. "Sure, you’ll get it done, but it will be slower. The same goes for your running pace – sure, you’ll able to do it, it will just be slower.
 "When we used to race against guys that trained at altitude, they had an advantage when they were at sea level. We called it the EPO (blood doping) effect. So when runners train in the summer, and then the fall rolls around, it feels like you are having the same kind of EPO effect.”
 Smith has a couple of suggestions for training in the summer months.
 • Run by perceived effort versus actual pace time.
 “This is something you’ll hear experienced runners say all the time, ‘just run by effort,’” Smith said. “Running by perceived effort is judging your running pace by effort, or how hard it feels versus how fast you're moving as measured in average mile pace. Because our bodies have to work harder in higher temps and humidity, by using the perceived effort scale in the summer it will account for the additional stress heat places on our system.”
 •Adjust your goals.
 Summer is not a time for best performances, especially in longer distances like half-marathon and marathons. Physiologically speaking, your body just doesn’t cope well in higher temperatures.
 “I have to talk several clients off a ledge every summer because they see a drop in performance,” Smith said. “They are used to a certain performance level, and when it’s not reached, they get frustrated. It’s normal. When the cool temperatures return, your body will feel the difference and your times will reflect the change.”

It came as little surprise that McVay said Donald, a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, reminded him most of Jordan.


  "Just 'cause of that ability to compete," McVay said.


  "I became a bigger fan of M.J.," Donald said. "His mindset was just to win, to be great, to be the best, and for me, the way he was able to -- somebody just say one thing and for him to just feed off that and just dominate, that's amazing to be able to just turn the switch."


  The Rams wrapped up their virtual offseason program after seven weeks, two weeks before the NFL's June 26 guideline that offseason programs could run through.


  Veteran players are scheduled to report to training camp at the team facility in Thousand Oaks on July 28. Quarterbacks, rookies and players rehabbing injuries can report a few days earlier.


  In their final meeting, McVay emphasized to players that they're navigating "uncharted territory."


  "Give yourself a chance to decompress," he said. "But make sure that you establish your process, your rhythm. I feel like we've been able to gain an edge in the midst of all the things going on and we've got to maintain that edge so that we can hit the ground running when we come back."


  Although he tried to keep their on-screen meetings fresh and moving, even the typically energetic McVay had something to admit before departing for his own early summer vacation.


  "I'm virtual meetinged-out right now," he said, chuckling.

State regulators say the Chemours Co. plant near Fayetteville this month illegally dumped several dozen truckloads of soil, tree stumps and root mats that could be contaminated with the GenX chemical into an unlined landfill in Cumberland County.


   


  Contaminated materials must not be deposited in unlined landfills, says a letter the Department of Environmental Quality sent to Chemours on Thursday. The company should have tested the materials first as the Chemours property has a "well-documented and pervasive PFAS contamination," the letter says.


   


  The company could be fined up to $15,000 per day for each violation, the letter says.


   


  "We will not tolerate irresponsible actions or attempts to cut corners that risk further impacts to the surrounding communities and to water quality," DEQ Secretary Michael S. Regan said in a news release about the matter.


   


  GenX is a PFAS -- a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substance -- that is being studied as a potential carcinogen. Regulators say researchers found it has caused diseases in lab animals.


   


  The potentially contaminated soil and plant debris was deposited at the Hunt's Construction Services landfill, the DEQ said. This is off Doc Bennett Road near the Fayetteville Regional Airport. The Hunt's Construction landfill is not licensed to accept contaminated materials, the DEQ said.


   


  The materials have since been taken to another landfill, Chemours said in a statement Thursday evening.


   


  The Chemours factory, which is in Bladen County by the Cumberland County line, has been under scrutiny since summer 2017 after it was reported by the StarNews in Wilmington that the company was discharging GenX into the air and water.


   


  The chemical has been found in drinking water supplies across southeastern North Carolina, from the Gray's Creek community in southern Cumberland County outside of Fayetteville to Wilmington on the coast. GenX has been found in wells and the Cape Fear River.


   


  In response to the situation, Chemours has revised its operations and installed equipment to stop its GenX emissions. This is to meet the terms of a court order, called a consent order, from litigation with the state.


   


  Contaminated land on the property continues to leach GenX into the Cape Fear River, records have said. The consent order requires Chemours to address that.


   


  Gray's Creek resident Mike Watters, a prominent activist for residents amid the GenX situation, said Monday he and his wife discovered the dumping June 1 and reported it to the DEQ.


   


  The couple was driving to the William O. Huske dam on the Cape Fear River to see how high the river was, Watters said, when they noticed that the back gate of Chemours was open. The gate is on a public road to the dam.


   


  They saw work underway on the Chemours property and big trucks with large trailers loaded with dirt driving out, Watters said.


   


  This is where Chemours is building a water treaTment facility to meet the terms of the consent order, Chemous said in its statement Thursday night.


   


  "As part of the site preparation activity required to comply with the consent order agreement with NC DEQ, we removed the roots of felled trees from a location on our site that never housed production activity," Chemours said.


   


  The couple followed the trucks to the Hunt's Construction landfill, Watters said. He took photos and contacted the DEQ, he said.


   


  "What they're doing is, they're clearing off the pad where they're going to put in a granular activated carbon filtration system to filter all the water from the old outfall," Watters said. "They're cutting trees down, digging up roots and leveling all the soil. Well, that's all contaminated soil and debris," he said.


   


  The DEQ letter says Hunt's Construction reported 38 truckloads were dumped at its landfill on June 1 and 2. Watters said he saw more trucks in the week prior that he believes were from the Chemours site.


   


  Chemours said it responded immediately when contacted by DEQ and moved the debris to another landfill.


   


  Work continues on the project, Chemours said.


   


  "We don't anticipate that this matter will delay the completion of the water treatment facility by our September 30, 2020 timeline," it said.

Bynum said on Thursday he is not attending the rally.      Even as the president's re-election campaign moves forward with the rally, Tulsa has called off its own Juneteenth celebration this year to prevent the spread of COVID-19.      Trump's rally also comes as the city grapples with not only the current coronavirus crisis but also its painful past of racial violence.      This year, Tulsa is marking the 99th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, when a white mob attacked black residents, burning and completely destroying black homes and businesses in a prosperous black district.      The focus on the African American community is paramount for Democrats -- who are relying on the voting bloc to not only overwhelmingly support Biden in the fall, but turn out in far higher numbers than they did in 2016.      The DNC's efforts will also run counter to Trump's long-standing efforts to court the black vote.      Four years ago, Trump won only 8% of the black vote, according to national exit poll data, only two percentage points higher than former Republican nominee Mitt Romney's 6 percent in 2012.      In November of last year, he stopped in Atlanta to launch a "Black Voices for Trump" coalition -- an effort to coalesce what is usually a dedicated Democratic-leaning voting bloc around his re-election campaign.      "We've done more for African Americans in three years than the broken Washington establishment has done in more than 30 years," he said at the launch. "We've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election...Last month, the African American unemployment rate reached the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country."

Visitors to the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument near Las Cruces, New Mexico, will get the feel of being on top of the world hiking up trails offering beautiful views.      This angular granite mountain range's rocky spires stand almost 9,000 feet tall against the Chihuahuan Desert floor. The peaks include the Robledo Mountains, Sierra de las Uvas, Portrillo Mountains and Doña Ana Mountains. Hikers will find narrow canyons mixed with open woodlands. From the desert to the ponderosa pines in the highest elevations, the land offers many opportunities for visitors from photography to horseback riding and mountain biking, camping, hiking and wildlife viewing.      The Portrillo Mountains stand as the most remote section of the Monument. The area is southwest of Las Cruces and known for its volcanic landscape including cinder cones, lava flows and craters. The Doña Ana Mountains is a pedestrian, equestrian and biker's paradise. Rock climbing routes and even some motorized use areas can take visitors to some of the higher elevations. Bird watching, backpacking, camping, hunting and fishing opportunities are plentiful.      The park was established May 21, 2014, and consists of 496,330 acres. The Dripping Springs Visitors Center on the western edge of the Organ Mountains is open all year, except winter holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Dripping Springs Natural Area is an opportunity for visitors to take a great hike with beautiful views of the Rio Grande River and Mesilla Valley. Trails offer easy to moderate hikes and are scenic with wildlife. The path is gravel, so good closed toes shoes are best. If you can walk two miles at 5,000 feet, you can do this hike. There are shaded benches along the way.      This national monument not only provides a variety of things to do for travelers but also protects prehistoric, historic, geologic and biologic resources. These scientific resources are divided onto the four mountain areas.      Just northwest of Las Cruces, the canyons and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands offer beautiful views. Hikers can find petroglyphs from three Native American cultures and stagecoach and wagon tracks in the grasslands from the Butterfield Stage Station.      The park has 10 wilderness areas including the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument, established in 2009. The idea was to protect and conserve the area, which hosts a deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized footprint megatrackways within about 5,280 acres. The area has footprints of amphibians, reptiles and insects, as well as plants and petrified wood that date back 280 million years. It is home to one of the most scientifically significant early Permian track sites in the world.      Although there are plenty of hiking, horseback riding and off-roading opportunities on these areas there are no areas, yet, that are developed to see the fossils. They are being preserved for study. Some fossils have been removed and are shown in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque. For those interested in viewing the tracks, the Las Cruces Museum of Nature and Science has a 30 foot and a 15 foot trackway on display.      Two other popular trails for a walk or hike are the La Cueva trail, offering a cave to explore, and the Fillmore trail, which has a mine and waterfall.      Make sure to have water, good hiking boots or shoes, binoculars, snacks or a picnic. For information on the monument areas call the Bureau of Land Management at 575-522-1219 or visit blm.gov.      Visit lascrucescvb.org for places to stay, eat and things to do.

"There's going to be a lot of people who are also going to double down on the push for reparations," Ray said. "There's no reason why black people have been the only group in the United States to be systematically discriminated against, legally, by the federal government and not receive reparations."
 Juneteenth marks the day on June 19, 1865, that Union soldiers told enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, that the Civil War had ended and they were free. The Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in the South in 1863 but it was not enforced in many places until after the end of the Civil War in 1865.
 The day is recognized in 47 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. Hawaii, North Dakota and South Dakota are the only states without an official recognition. And it is not yet a federal holiday. It took roughly 18 years after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. before his birthday was observed as a federal holiday.
 Still, more workers than perhaps ever in history will have the day off on Friday: Nike, the NFL, Twitter and its mobile payments services company Square, along with a handful of media outlets, have announced plans to observe Juneteenth as a company holiday. On Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees.
 The abolition of slavery in the U.S. was followed by the birth of Jim Crow segregation, relegating many black Americans to poor, redlined neighborhoods with under-resourced schools. After the passage of landmark civil rights protections in the 1960s, decades of mass incarceration policy and employment discrimination eroded opportunities and economic stability for black people and families. All along, police brutality has been a fixture of the black American experience. And now, COVID-19 is killing black people at more than three times the rate that it kills white people.
 Much of the systemic racism and atrocities visited on black Americans have gone unanswered. This week, the Equal Justice Initiative, which in 2015 cataloged thousands of racial terror lynchings of black people by white mobs, added nearly 2,000 Reconstruction-era lynchings confirmed between 1865 and 1876, bringing the total number of documented lynchings to nearly 6,500.
 "Our continued silence about the history of racial injustice has fueled many of the current problems surrounding police violence, mass incarceration, racial inequality and the disparate impact of COVID-19," said Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative.
 "We need a new era of truth and justice in America," he said in a statement. "We must acknowledge our long history of racial oppression and then repair the damage this history has created — including the presumption of dangerousness that gets assigned to black people by police and others."
 Juneteenth also comes at a time when the nation is at a political crossroads, and Black Voters Matter co-founder Latosha Brown said it is shaping up to be a politically defining moment ahead of the November election.
 "The devaluing of black lives is built into this American system to the point that the ideas around democracy don't apply to us the same way that they apply to white folks," Brown said, adding black voters are demanding change.
 "So Juneteenth is a celebratory event but we're not celebrating the country. We're celebrating our own freedom and our own ability to be liberated and the resiliency of black people."

A hundred years of innovation in communication has dramatically changed our ability to quickly exchange vital data.

“What happened on ‘Sleepy Hollow’ is really interesting,” said Beharie tactfully. “We had a lot of things happen that paralleled the conversations that are happening in this moment.”
 Before Abbie’s sacrificial death to save her white partner Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison), the show had already begun to sideline the character in favor of a (critically-panned) romantic subplot between Ichabod and his wife. And behind the scenes, Beharie and Mison were treated as disparately as their characters were on-screen.
 “My costar and I were both sick at the same time but I don’t believe that we were treated equally,” said Beharie. “He was allowed to go back to England for a month [to recover while] I was given Episode 9 to shoot on my own. So I pushed through it and then by the end of that episode I was in urgent care. And all the doctors, including the doctors that the studio was sending, were all confirming, ‘Hey, she can’t work right now.’”
 Beharie was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that, at the time, she attributed to her abrupt departure. “There’s a lot of pressure in a situation like that where so many people are relying on you alone to get up and get going,” she said. “I feel like it’s taken me the last few years to really see clearly that it wasn’t personal, it’s about the way that these structures are set up. It was very difficult to talk about at the time because I wanted to get back to work. But I was labeled as problematic and blacklisted by some people.”

WINSTON-SALEM -- Retirement remains a rewarding run for Michael Bingham of Burlington, the former Wake Forest sprinter who continues to collect prestigious honors years after hanging up his track cleats.


   


  Bingham will become a Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame inductee as part of the new six-member class announced this week.


   


  An NCAA champion, four-time All-American and Olympic medalist, Bingham is set to join the school's sports Hall of Fame alongside two players from the Demon Deacons' 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference champion football team -- quarterback Riley Skinner and kicker / punter Sam Swank.


   


  Also to be inducted are former women's golf coach Dianne Dailey, men's soccer goalkeeper William Hesmer and diver Drew Taylor.


   


  Bingham finished first in the 400 meters at the 2009 NCAA indoor track and field championships, cementing his spot as one of three Wake Forest track and field athletes to ever claim a national title.


   


  An eight-time ACC champion, Bingham won four individual and four relay titles in the league while at Wake Forest. He was the 2009 ACC Performer of the Year at the indoor championships.


   


  Bingham was awarded a bronze medal as part of Great Britain's 1,600-meter relay at the 2008 Olympics, after the third-place Russian team was disqualified for doping in 2017, nine years after those Beijing Games. Bingham, whose father is from Great Britain, holds dual citizenship.


   


  Bingham is one of four Demon Deacons to medal at the Olympics, joining baseball player Bill Masse (gold at the 1988 Seoul Games) and men's basketball players Tim Duncan (bronze at the 2004 Athens Games) and Chris Paul (gold at both the 2008 Beijing Games and 2012 London Games).


   


  Bingham retired from professional competition in 2015.


   


  Skinner is the winningest quarterback in Wake Forest history, collecting 31 victories as a starter from 2006-09. He set school records for completions, completion percentage, passing yards, passing efficiency and touchdown passes during his playing days.


   


  As a redshirt freshman in 2006, Skinner led the Demon Deacons to their most recent ACC championship en route to an 11-3 record and an appearance in the 2007 Orange Bowl. The ACC Rookie of the Year and a second-team All-ACC selection that season, Skinner later became the first Wake Forest quarterback to lead the team to three bowl games.


   


  Swank is the leading scorer in Wake Forest football history, notching 337 points from 2005-08. His three field goals in the 2006 ACC championship provided all of Wake Forest's scoring in a 9-6 victory against Georgia Tech, earning him Most Valuable Player honors in the game.


   


  Swank holds school records for longest field goal (53 yards) and longest punt (86), as well as most field goals made, most extra-point kicks made and most consecutive extra-point kicks made. In 2006, he was named an All-ACC kicker and earned honorable mention honors as a punter.


   


  Dailey served as the Wake Forest women's golf coach for 30 years, guiding the Demon Deacons to 30 team titles and 38 individual championships before her retirement following the 2018 season.

She directed the Demon Deacons to 15 NCAA Tournament appearances in a career that saw her mentor 27 All-Americans, 39 All-ACC selections and five ACC Players of the Year. Dailey coached 2018 NCAA champion Jennifer Kupcho in her final season at the helm of the Demon Deacons.


   


  Hesmer became a star goalkeeper for the Wake Forest men's soccer team from 2000-03, earning second team All-American honors in 2002 and making the first team in 2003. The two-time All-ACC performer led the conference in goals against average in 2002.

Domestic professional football will be played into the winter months next year after FFA secured a revised broadcast deal for the A-League with Fox Sports.


  The 12-month agreement will mean the pay TV network's relationship with Australian football will extend until at least July 2021.


  Under the deal, Fox will broadcast the remainder of the 2019-20 A-League season and the 2020-21 campaign.


  It means the planned resumption of the current A-League campaign on July 16 can go ahead as planned.


  The 2020-21 campaign will now kick off in December and conclude in July next year.


  It means for the first time since 1989, domestic professional football will be played in Australia in winter.


  FFA chief executive James Johnson hinted the move may be longer term than just for the new broadcast agreement.


  "The shift in the timing of the next A-League season is a strategic decision to enhance the alignment of our top tier professional men's league with the grassroots playing season," he said.


  "There are numerous benefits to this, including better aligning the competition pyramid of Australian football to facilitate enhanced football outcomes like a modern domestic transfer system, and enabling deeper engagement with our vast grassroots football community at the precise time our many participants are most engaged in our great game.


  "Despite challenging times, this deal will help us continue the process of transforming our professional leagues and move the sport towards an exciting future."


  The FFA and Fox had been at loggerheads ever since the league was suspended due to the COVID-19 crisis in March.


  It is understood the new deal is a $32 million contract, significantly less than the $57 million-a-year Fox was paying as part of its previous six-year deal which was set to run until 2023.


  That deal is now dead in the water and the FFA will have to use the next 12 months to either negotiate a new contract with Fox or find another broadcast partner.


  "This new deal also provides us with the opportunity to work with FFA over the next year as they reset and re-energise the professional game in Australia and explore the best possible range of future broadcast options for the game," Fox Sports head Peter Campbell said.


  As well as the A-League and W-League, the new deal also includes the final four Socceroos World Cup qualifiers in their Asian round two group and any Socceroos or Matildas friendlies scheduled between now and the end of July 2021.


  It does not include the FFA Cup, which may be broadcast in-house by the FFA and clubs via an online streaming platform.


  "We are excited for the future of the FFA Cup and will make further announcements about its future direction in due course," Johnson said.


  ABC TV will continue to broadcast one A-League and one W-League match per week until the end of July 2021 as well as FFA-controlled Socceroos and Matildas matches.

“What happened on ‘Sleepy Hollow’ is really interesting,” said Beharie tactfully. “We had a lot of things happen that paralleled the conversations that are happening in this moment.”


  Before Abbie’s sacrificial death to save her white partner Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison), the show had already begun to sideline the character in favor of a (critically-panned) romantic subplot between Ichabod and his wife. And behind the scenes, Beharie and Mison were treated as disparately as their characters were on-screen.


  “My costar and I were both sick at the same time but I don’t believe that we were treated equally,” said Beharie. “He was allowed to go back to England for a month [to recover while] I was given Episode 9 to shoot on my own. So I pushed through it and then by the end of that episode I was in urgent care. And all the doctors, including the doctors that the studio was sending, were all confirming, ‘Hey, she can’t work right now.’”


  Beharie was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that, at the time, she attributed to her abrupt departure. “There’s a lot of pressure in a situation like that where so many people are relying on you alone to get up and get going,” she said. “I feel like it’s taken me the last few years to really see clearly that it wasn’t personal, it’s about the way that these structures are set up. It was very difficult to talk about at the time because I wanted to get back to work. But I was labeled as problematic and blacklisted by some people.”

Some argue it was strategically unwise for China to clash with India in Ladakh. Doing so will inevitably damage China’s reputation among the Indian military, diplomatic corps, and population at large. The move could also drive New Delhi into a closer partnership with Washington. But for Beijing, standing up for its interests and territorial claims is worth the cost. India is believed to be strategically unreliable to begin with, and China has no interest in acquiescing to India’s attempt to advance its position on territorial disputes to trade for concessions. That is almost an established rule in China’s India playbook: having dealt with India in the past, such acquiescence will not be seen as China’s good will, but a concession extracted due to India’s strength. This will only lead to even more aggressive Indian behavior down the road.

Therefore, he said, “The Northern Elders Forum has counselled the CNG to suspend its marches and explore additional avenues with other groups and individuals to sustain the momentum and keep the government on its toes. We have also agreed that all groups in the North should be encouraged to raise their levels of vigilance and organization to demand that our elected leaders live up to their oath to secure Nigerians.      The statement  further noted that “The Northern Elders Forum is confident in the maturity of members of the CNG to demonstrate the best traditions of respect for elders for which our Northern communities are famous.      “As we await the outcome of their deliberation on this, we wish to draw the attention of President Buhari and all governments that neither the Forum nor the CNG represent a threat to them. We do, however, represent voices that need to be heard in our current circumstance in the North,” Baba-Ahmed said. The text of NEF statement signed by Hakeem Baba-Ahmed reads thus in full: “Northern Elders Forum is aware that the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) had commenced a planned series of peaceful marches in all parts of the North to invite attention to the dire state of security of lives and property in many communities in the North. Two of such marches had held in Minna, Niger State and in Katsina. After the protest in Katsina, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the CNG, Nastura Ashir Shariff was invited to Abuja and detained. He was released in the evening yesterday.      “The Forum and many well-meaning Nigerians had demanded that he be released or charged, and we wish to use this opportunity to appreciate all persons and groups who have intervened to deepen the rule of law and the rights of citizens to engage in peaceful protest. We recall that then General Muhammadu Buhari and leadership of the APC had exercised these same rights before his election as President.      “Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that there are plans to disrupt these peaceful protests and subvert their objectives in some parts of the North. The goals of these subversives are to create a hostile environment that will worsen the state of insecurity in which our people live, and divert attention from their goal, which is basically to urge government to take firm and immediate steps to arrest the bleeding in the North.      “The Northern Elders Forum has therefore engaged the CNG in discussions to prevent a subversion of its otherwise commendable efforts to organize peaceful marches and protests. We both took cognizance of some positive developments since the Minna and Katsina marches. President Muhammadu Buhari had appealed to people in Katsina to be patient as plans to clear the State of bandits are under way. After the marches, President Buhari dispatched a high-powered delegation to some States in the North West to meet with Governors and convey his concerns and plans to take firmer action against banditry, rustlers, kidnappers and rapists who have made lives of our people virtually valueless. Yesterday, President Buhari met with Service Chiefs and expressed his disappointment at their records and performance, and directed them to do better to protect our communities. All these are evidence that the administration is taking note of the growing outrage from many quarters, but particularly from the courage and the faith of members of the CNG that change comes only when we raise our voices and act against indifference and incompetence.      “We realize that there is still a long way to go, and many Northerners are concerned that protests and marches do not become the only means of getting our leaders to do what is right.      “The Northern Elders Forum has counselled the CNG to suspend its marches and explore additional avenues with other groups and individuals to sustain the momentum and keep the government on its toes. We have also agreed that all groups in the North should be encouraged to raise their levels of vigilance and organization to demand that our elected leaders live up to their oath to secure Nigerians.      “The Northern Elders Forum is confident in the maturity of members of the CNG to demonstrate the best traditions of respect for elders for which our Northern communities are famous.      “As we await the outcome of their deliberation on this, we wish to draw the attention of President Buhari and all governments that neither the Forum nor the CNG represent a threat to them. We do, however, represent voices that need to be heard in our current circumstance in the North.”

  WINSTON-SALEM -- Retirement remains a rewarding run for Michael Bingham of Burlington, the former Wake Forest sprinter who continues to collect prestigious honors years after hanging up his track cleats.


  Bingham will become a Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame inductee as part of the new six-member class announced this week.


  An NCAA champion, four-time All-American and Olympic medalist, Bingham is set to join the school's sports Hall of Fame alongside two players from the Demon Deacons' 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference champion football team -- quarterback Riley Skinner and kicker / punter Sam Swank.


  Also to be inducted are former women's golf coach Dianne Dailey, men's soccer goalkeeper William Hesmer and diver Drew Taylor.


  Bingham finished first in the 400 meters at the 2009 NCAA indoor track and field championships, cementing his spot as one of three Wake Forest track and field athletes to ever claim a national title.


  An eight-time ACC champion, Bingham won four individual and four relay titles in the league while at Wake Forest. He was the 2009 ACC Performer of the Year at the indoor championships.


  Bingham was awarded a bronze medal as part of Great Britain's 1,600-meter relay at the 2008 Olympics, after the third-place Russian team was disqualified for doping in 2017, nine years after those Beijing Games. Bingham, whose father is from Great Britain, holds dual citizenship.


  Bingham is one of four Demon Deacons to medal at the Olympics, joining baseball player Bill Masse (gold at the 1988 Seoul Games) and men's basketball players Tim Duncan (bronze at the 2004 Athens Games) and Chris Paul (gold at both the 2008 Beijing Games and 2012 London Games).


  Bingham retired from professional competition in 2015.


  Skinner is the winningest quarterback in Wake Forest history, collecting 31 victories as a starter from 2006-09. He set school records for completions, completion percentage, passing yards, passing efficiency and touchdown passes during his playing days.


  As a redshirt freshman in 2006, Skinner led the Demon Deacons to their most recent ACC championship en route to an 11-3 record and an appearance in the 2007 Orange Bowl. The ACC Rookie of the Year and a second-team All-ACC selection that season, Skinner later became the first Wake Forest quarterback to lead the team to three bowl games.


  Swank is the leading scorer in Wake Forest football history, notching 337 points from 2005-08. His three field goals in the 2006 ACC championship provided all of Wake Forest's scoring in a 9-6 victory against Georgia Tech, earning him Most Valuable Player honors in the game.


  Swank holds school records for longest field goal (53 yards) and longest punt (86), as well as most field goals made, most extra-point kicks made and most consecutive extra-point kicks made. In 2006, he was named an All-ACC kicker and earned honorable mention honors as a punter.


  Dailey served as the Wake Forest women's golf coach for 30 years, guiding the Demon Deacons to 30 team titles and 38 individual championships before her retirement following the 2018 season.


  A four-time ACC Coach of the Year, Dailey's teams won four ACC championships. She directed the Demon Deacons to 15 NCAA Tournament appearances in a career that saw her mentor 27 All-Americans, 39 All-ACC selections and five ACC Players of the Year. Dailey coached 2018 NCAA champion Jennifer Kupcho in her final season at the helm of the Demon Deacons.


  Hesmer became a star goalkeeper for the Wake Forest men's soccer team from 2000-03, earning second team All-American honors in 2002 and making the first team in 2003. The two-time All-ACC performer led the conference in goals against average in 2002.


  Selected 17th overall by the Columbus Crew in the 2004 Major League Soccer Draft, Hesmer later experienced an MLS championship with the club in 2008. In 2010, Hesmer scored a goal in a game against Toronto FC, becoming just the second goalie to do so in MLS history. He retired from professional soccer in 2013.


  Taylor is the first member of Wake Forest's swimming and diving teams to be inducted into the school's sports Hall of Fame. As a diver, Taylor won five individual ACC titles from 1964-66. He won every diving title at all of Wake Forest's dual meets as a senior.

Steve Smith never expected to be here.
 He never expected to be sitting in an office in Cookesville, Tennessee, in the middle of June, waiting for a phone call from a prospective pitching recruit. He never would have pictured himself wearing a Tennessee Tech T-shirt, in purple of all colors. But Smith has learned over his 59 years to trust God’s plan, even if it takes you down paths you didn’t see coming.
 Smith, who spent 20 years as Baylor’s head baseball coach, is employed as a head coach again. After much prayer and consideration, he took the Tennessee Tech head job in December. He acknowledged that it was a “bad time of year” to take over a program. He had to hit the ground running in a full sprint.

Smith experienced plenty of joy at Baylor, too. He and Melinda raised two boys, Ryan and Case, in Waco. He witnessed one of the great college baseball careers of all-time in Jason Jennings. He took the Bears to 13 NCAA regional trips and an appearance in the College World Series in 2005. In 2012, Smith’s Bears won their first 18 Big 12 games and clinched the conference title before suffering their first league loss.
 The program took a downturn after that season. In 2015, on the heels of a third straight sub-.500 campaign, Baylor fired Smith.
 Five years later, Smith said it still stings.
 “To leave in the manner that it was done, after a 35-year relationship, has been a little bit for me like going through a divorce of a 35-year marriage,” Smith said. “I don’t know how you spin that. People have told me, ‘Well, you really had a good run.’ Well, you don’t tell anybody who got divorced after 35 years that you had a good run. But that’s how it felt to me.”
 So, what do you do? You dust yourself off and move on. You cling to the good memories.
 Right after he lost his job at Baylor, Smith created a Facebook group for his former BU players. He wanted to find a way that they could all stay in touch. He said that the group has leaned on each other in recent years following the death of Steven White in January 2019 and Ron Patterson earlier this year.
 Ryan and Case both hold degrees from Baylor, just like their parents. In fact, Smith said, “I’ve got a wife who if you cut her open she’s going to bleed green. She’s still bleeding green today. And I think deep down I bleed green, too. I’m not going to let a few misguided souls do any more damage to Baylor or to me than they were already able to do.”
 Smith’s job ended, but his calling didn’t. He spent the 2017 season as a volunteer assistant at Santa Clara, then in August of that year he accepted a similar volunteer assistant role at Auburn, overseeing the pitching staff.

A border settlement between China and India is unlikely in the foreseeable future, and Beijing believes it has little incentive to push for a quick resolution. China’s priority remains crisis management and escalation prevention, until India is willing to embrace a package deal which basically follows the earlier trade between the eastern section and the western section, with the exception of Tawang. While the Chinese understand the Indian sense of urgency to resolve issues between the two countries, Beijing sees the unsettled border as leverage to bog down India in the region and undermine its global potential. For China, the Chinese and Indian demands are different and asymmetrical by design. Key concessions India demands from China on the border settlement are hard commitments that cannot be reversed. By contrast, what China seeks from India, such as its neutrality in the U.S.-China strategic competition, is ephemeral and easily adjustable. While New Delhi sees addressing the border issue as a prerequisite for India to trust China, Beijing doesn’t believe that relinquishing its leverage will in any way stop India from conducting hostile actions down the road, such as aligning with America to undermine Chinese interests in the Indian Ocean region.

At the end of the day, it was tough to come to a conclusion because there were so many people in our league that agreed with us, that are part of the brotherhood, that are part of the locker room, but they were not willing to sacrifice their relationships with their families — rightfully so — to take a stand with their teammates.
 There were conversations had behind closed doors where it was like, “Hey, I want to stand with you guys. I want to make the point. I want to protest. I want to do my part. But if I sit, I kneel, I do anything, then I won’t be able to go home to my family. Because my family sees this a certain way. It’s hard for me to explain to them how to understand this.” So the stance that the league has taken over the last few years, it’s hard for them to come back and rebuke what they’ve already done. The damage is already done. So there’s really nothing they can do. The players are doing everything in their power to use their platforms or their social media, whether it’s press conferences, using their own money, their foundations to reach out and do the actual work. Whether it’s the Players Coalition and the people like Malcolm Jenkins or Anquan Boldin, going out there and trying to legally change things, change it in Congress and in law. But at the end of the day, the league is going to throw money at it. If they really cared, it would be a different story. But they already showed that they didn’t really care about the issue, so once they already made that stance, it’s hard to come back off that. It hard to come back and say, “Hey, we care now. Hey, Colin Kaepernick was right.” It’s hard for Goodell to say, “Hey, hire Colin Kaepernick. Get him a job.” It’s difficult for that to have meaning and truth.

The founder and chief executive of scandal-hit Wirecard resigned on Friday after the German payments provider was hit with fresh fraud allegations that have left it struggling for survival.
 Markus Braun "resigned today with immediate effect", the firm said in a statement, adding that the decision was made "in mutual consent with the supervisory board".
 He will be replaced on an interim basis by US manager James Freis.
 The bombshell comes a day after auditors from Ernst & Young said 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) were missing from Wirecard's accounts, intensifying a months-long crisis in the company.
 The news prompted investors to abandon the once popular fintech company in droves, sending Wirecard's share prices into a tailspin.
 The stock has plunged by more than 76 percent since Thursday morning and was trading at 23.90 euros a share by 1130 GMT on Friday.
 It marks a stunning fall from grace for the Bavarian start-up, set up in 1999 and once seen as a darling of the fintech scene thanks to the growing global popularity of electronic payments.
 It entered Germany's prestigious DAX 30 index with great fanfare in 2018 after nudging out traditional lender Commerzbank.
 But since then Wirecard has been dogged by a series of articles in the Financial Times alleging accounting irregularities in its Asian operations.
 The company's four board members -- including Braun -- have been under investigation since early June by Munich prosecutors for "market manipulation", and Wirecard's headquarters were searched as part of the probe.
 The scandal deepened on Thursday when the firm was forced to delay the publication of its 2019 results for a fourth time.
 Instead, Wirecard said in a statement that auditors Ernst & Young had identified "spurious balance confirmations" relating to "cash balances on trust accounts".
 \- Ticking clock -
 The auditors' red flag was raised over escrow accounts at two Asian banks, which were supposed to hold 1.9 billion euros to manage risk for merchants using Wirecard's payment services.
 Wirecard said there were "indications" that the balances had been falsified "in order to deceive the auditor".
 The two Philippine banks that were supposed to hold the cash denied having a relationship with Wirecard, according to Bloomberg News.
 Wirecard's board responded by fling a legal complaint against "unknown persons", saying they could have fallen victim to a vast fraud.
 "It is currently unclear whether fraudulent transactions to the detriment of Wirecard AG have occurred," Braun said on Thursday.
 But the clock is ticking for Wirecard, as two billion euros of credit could be withdrawn if it is unable to publish its results for last year by Friday.
 According to preliminary figures, the group said it had processed 173 billion euros of transactions in 2019, up 38.5 percent.
 Revenues grew 37.5 percent, to 2.8 billion euros, while net profits added 39 percent at 482 million, Wirecard said.

As an African American living and ministering in Canada, I notice that the reality here is at a slightly lower temperature than the experience that I’ve described above. But what I’ve observed is that Canadians need to get past the illusion that racism is only an American problem that has no real parallel in the Canadian context. Canada is almost seen as the “Switzerland” of the Americas, but she too had the “dirty hands” of slavery, with over 4,000 slaves throughout Canada’s history. I have observed and have been fascinated by the fact that when Canadians acknowledge racism at all, it is only to acknowledge the history of the dehumanization and destruction of Indigenous people. All other racialized groups are excluded from the narrative of racism in Canada. This narrative allows Canadians to ignore and dismiss the intricate web of racism that has systemically and institutionally shaped the development of the Canadian version of multiculturalism.

Bristol, Rhode Island, is known for the oldest annual July 4 celebration in America. Its rich history and passion for everything red, white and blue earned its fame as America's most patriotic town. Each Independence Day thousands of spectators attend the parade that honors civil servants, military and fire personnel in the community.      This year -- due to constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic -- the 235th celebration will be a "drive-by" all-auto parade. Local bands will play, but there will be no marchers. Starting at 8:30 a.m., the annual star-spangled spectacle takes the parade route and ends at the town common for patriotic exercises.      "Bristol is open for business. All restaurants and lodgings are now up and running," said Jeff Hirsch, co-chairman of Explore Bristol, the town's tourism arm. "We expect most attractions to re-open in July."      The town's respect for the past runs deep. Hope Street is painted in red, white and blue stripes running down the middle. Nearly every house flies an American flag, while red, white and blue bunting covers porch railings. Pillows on the white wicker chairs of front porches are adorned with messages such as "Home of the Brave."      For three centuries, the shores of Bristol have framed a way of life for those who love to travel, fish and explore. This deepwater seaport is named after the town of Bristol, England. It has museums, historic homes, a waterfront and 20-plus restaurants all packed into a small town (pop. 22,000) in the smallest state in the nation.      Narragansett Bay is a dramatic backdrop for Bristol's wildlife preserves, parks, bike paths and quaint seafood restaurants. The stunning 14-mile East Bay Bike Path hugs the shore to Providence, the capital.      Magnificent architecture abounds. The historic district is lovingly preserved with homes from the 1800s and wide, tree lined streets.      Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum is one of the finest garden estates in New England, with 33 landscaped acres and a 45-room English-style 1908 manor house filled with antiques and artwork. Visitors often spend hours touring the grounds and mansion.      Located in the center of town on Hope Street, Linden Place is the crown jewel of the historic district. The 1810 mansion and sculpture gardens are open to the public for guided tours. The rich and powerful have graced the ancestral home of the DeWolf (no relation to the writer) and Colt families for more than two centuries. Presidents, industrialists and Hollywood celebrities were guests here, including the actress Ethel Barrymore. The mansion seeks to reopen soon; get information at lindenplace.org.      Bristol is the quintessential New England waterfront town. It is also a thriving arts community, abundant with a wealth of literary and cultural resources. A broad network of artists, writers and musicians have found a home here.      In keeping with social distancing practices, Sculpture on the Lawn is an outdoor exhibit by the Bristol Art Museum displayed on the front lawns of Linden Place Mansion and the Bradford-Dimond-Norris House on Hope Street. The exhibits run through Labor Day Weekend.      The 1792 Bradford-Dimond-Norris House is an elegant bed and breakfast and historic landmark known for its hospitable innkeepers.      Quahog chowder and fried clams are among the New England delicacies served at the Lobster Pot Waterfront Restaurant and Bar overlooking the bay. Don't miss the stunning art gallery on the premises.      Bristol is halfway between Providence and Newport. For updates on July 4 activities, go to fourthofjulybristolri.com.

“Honestly, I wasn’t taught a whole lot about Juneteenth, it just _was_ ,” she said. “Where I grew up, you learned about Juneteenth by the community. School was inconsequential in that sense, it was a community education.


  “I remember every year I’d go [to the celebration] and there was always a parade and music and dancing. And to a kid, that’s an exciting time. I remember being invigorated by this sense of community.”


  Inspired by the real Miss Juneteenth competition, the indie drama stars Nicole Beharie as Turquoise Jones, a former beauty queen who has failed to achieve success beyond her pageant win. Turquoise is a single mother struggling to make ends meet while clinging fiercely to the hope that her rebellious teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) can replicate her win and create a different outcome for herself.


  “I loved Turquoise as a character because she exemplifies someone who a lot of people would just pass by without realizing the richness of her life,” said Beharie by phone from Georgia. “There are not a lot of movies about the women that keep things afloat. I was raised by a single mother so I just wanted to breathe some life into that as best I could. It feels like with a great deal of storytelling, there are perspectives that are missing or they’re always told in the exact same way.”

South African pharmaceutical giant Aspen Pharmacare has said that it is ready to scale up production of a generic anti-inflammatory drug that could help save the lives of critically ill coronavirus patients.
 A mass treatment trial led by Oxford University this week found that a low- dose steroid named dexamethasone could reduce mortality among ventilated patients by a third.
 Durban-based Aspen, the largest drug producer in Africa, will now "ramp up production" of the drug, Aspen senior executive Stavros Nicolaou said in an interview Thursday night.
 Dexamethasone has been on the market for over 60 years and usually serves to reduce inflammation.
 "We are still getting to terms with what the global demands will be," Nicolaou said.
 "Obviously, if this surges through the roof, you are going to have some constraints."
 The company currently manufactures dexamethasone tablets in Germany and contracts the drug's injectable form to third parties.
 The World Health Organization has flagged further research on the cheap and widely available steroid as a "priority", which is likely to lead to a surge in demand.
 Aspen's shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange soared to a three-month high after the study's release on Tuesday.
 "What this does for us, more importantly, is that it allows Aspen to continue playing a leading role in the South African COVID response and also more broadly in other countries," Nicolaou said, adding that the company has already been helping with coronavirus outbreaks across the world.
 Established in 1850, Aspen has been a major supplier of anaesthetics to European countries fighting COVID-19.
 "Anaesthetics are an important portfolio of products for COVID so we were able to make a difference for patients," Nicolaou explained.
 "We will now again be able to make a difference with dexamethasone."
 South Africa's health ministry has recognised the Britain-led dexamethasone trials as an "important breakthrough" that would be "easily implementable in our country".
 "The Department of Health... has recommended that dexamethasone can be considered for use on patients on ventilators and on oxygen supply," President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an address to the nation this week.
 "We believe that this will improve our management of the disease among those who are most severely affected."
 "It is quite exciting," Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on SABC national television, "because licences to do this drug all over the world are owned by a South African company."

I used to think that our love for American Abstract Expressionism had ceased. I was wrong. After meeting Tàpies and Juan Mirò in Spain (where we watched a despicable bullfight only to then later devour unforgettable bull balls, which brought both Helena and James Collins absolute disgust), we returned to New York to see our friends in September. First among them was Dore Ashton, our Abstract Expressionism expert who planned for us to visit an exhibition of Philip Guston at MoMa. Dore told us all about Guston’s life tragedies. He came from a Jewish family, who fled to California from Odessa, only to come across the Ku Klux Klan. Philip Goldstein (later known as Philip Guston) lost his father at the age of ten. Crushed by his debts and inner demons, his father committed suicide. But Philip didn't lose heart - still very young, he started collaborating with a comic book magazine that allowed him to continue his studies at the same school Jackson Pollock attended in Los Angeles. Soon after the two became close friends.

The answer is all of them. Ever since _Do the Right Thing_ in 1989, we have come to understand that Lee’s genius is his ability to portray opposing perspectives and competing preconceptions and turn them on their heads. There are few conflicts as compelling and emotionally real as those of Spike Lee’s movies. Lee takes his message and practically clobbers you over the head with it – his films could so easily have manifested as one-dimensional propaganda – but his deft sociopolitical awareness moulds them into loaded case studies of cultural conflict instead.

"Questo lavoro - sottolinea Stefano Merler, epidemiologo Fbk e autore dello studio - ci permette di dimostrare chiaramente le difficolta di individuare le infezioni con la sorveglianza, visto che la maggioranza di queste non sono associate a sintomi respiratori o febbre. L'indagine rappresenta inoltre un utile tassello per capire meglio il ruolo dei bambini nell'epidemiologia di Covid-19, cosa su cui si sa obiettivamente ancora poco. E' noto a tutti che sono stati identificati pochi bambini positivi durante la pandemia, ma questo studio permette di distinguere il contributo di una possibile minor suscettibilita all'infezione dei bambini, che avevamo identificato in un precedente studio condotto in Cina, rispetto appunto alla probabilita di sviluppare sintomi clinici una volta infetti".

After the passage of landmark civil rights protections in the 1960s, decades of mass incarceration policy and employment discrimination eroded opportunities and economic stability for black people and families.
 All along, police brutality has been a fixture of the black American experience. And now, COVID-19 is killing black people at more than three times the rate that it kills white people.
 Much of the systemic racism and atrocities visited on black Americans have gone unanswered.
 This week, the Equal Justice Initiative, which in 2015 cataloged thousands of racial terror lynchings of black people by white mobs, added nearly 2,000 Reconstruction-era lynchings confirmed between 1865 and 1876, bringing the total number of documented lynchings to nearly 6,500.

 FRAMINGHAM - A Medway man is facing drug charges after a traffic stop on Wednesday, authorities said.
 Police arrested Christopher Mullin, 62, after they pulled him over on Cochituate Road (Rte. 30), police said.
 Police pulled Mullin over for driving erratically near the Target store at 400 Cochituate Road. They discovered his license had been suspended.
 Police also discovered Mullin was in possession of several different types of unspecified prescription medications, police said.
 Police arrested Mullin, of 14 Sanford St., and charged him with three counts of possession of a Class E substance; operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs; driving to endanger; and driving with a suspended license, police said.
 After his arraignment Thursday in Framingham District Court, Mullin was released without bail but ordered not to drive. He is due back in court on July 18 for a pretrial conference.

For me, as an African American, the brutal murder of George Floyd is the last straw. People of African descent, for our entire 400-year history in America, have been put in the position of constantly having to defend our humanity, forced into a subculture of “over-achievement” so that we can be acknowledged as human beings and entitled to be equal citizens in our own country that we have helped build, died for and continue to defend. We are tired. We are angry. We are sick and tired of being sick and tired.

 Visitors to the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument near Las Cruces, New Mexico, will get the feel of being on top of the world hiking up trails offering beautiful views.
 This angular granite mountain range's rocky spires stand almost 9,000 feet tall against the Chihuahuan Desert floor. The peaks include the Robledo Mountains, Sierra de las Uvas, Portrillo Mountains and Doña Ana Mountains. Hikers will find narrow canyons mixed with open woodlands. From the desert to the ponderosa pines in the highest elevations, the land offers many opportunities for visitors from photography to horseback riding and mountain biking, camping, hiking and wildlife viewing.
 The Portrillo Mountains stand as the most remote section of the Monument. The area is southwest of Las Cruces and known for its volcanic landscape including cinder cones, lava flows and craters. The Doña Ana Mountains is a pedestrian, equestrian and biker's paradise. Rock climbing routes and even some motorized use areas can take visitors to some of the higher elevations. Bird watching, backpacking, camping, hunting and fishing opportunities are plentiful.
 The park was established May 21, 2014, and consists of 496,330 acres. The Dripping Springs Visitors Center on the western edge of the Organ Mountains is open all year, except winter holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Dripping Springs Natural Area is an opportunity for visitors to take a great hike with beautiful views of the Rio Grande River and Mesilla Valley. Trails offer easy to moderate hikes and are scenic with wildlife. The path is gravel, so good closed toes shoes are best. If you can walk two miles at 5,000 feet, you can do this hike. There are shaded benches along the way.
 This national monument not only provides a variety of things to do for travelers but also protects prehistoric, historic, geologic and biologic resources. These scientific resources are divided onto the four mountain areas.
 Just northwest of Las Cruces, the canyons and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands offer beautiful views. Hikers can find petroglyphs from three Native American cultures and stagecoach and wagon tracks in the grasslands from the Butterfield Stage Station.
 The park has 10 wilderness areas including the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument, established in 2009. The idea was to protect and conserve the area, which hosts a deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized footprint megatrackways within about 5,280 acres. The area has footprints of amphibians, reptiles and insects, as well as plants and petrified wood that date back 280 million years. It is home to one of the most scientifically significant early Permian track sites in the world.
 Although there are plenty of hiking, horseback riding and off-roading opportunities on these areas there are no areas, yet, that are developed to see the fossils. They are being preserved for study. Some fossils have been removed and are shown in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque. For those interested in viewing the tracks, the Las Cruces Museum of Nature and Science has a 30 foot and a 15 foot trackway on display.
 Two other popular trails for a walk or hike are the La Cueva trail, offering a cave to explore, and the Fillmore trail, which has a mine and waterfall.
 Make sure to have water, good hiking boots or shoes, binoculars, snacks or a picnic. For information on the monument areas call the Bureau of Land Management at 575-522-1219 or visit blm.gov.

When adolescence descended and my social life became paramount, I kept a vigil from my beach towel or walked the shoreline, scanning the clusters of umbrellas and chairs for boys and girls my age.


  Considering the only telephone I had access to was attached to the wood- paneled wall of our beach house or two miles down the road in a phone booth, my only means of communicating was face-to-face interaction. After scanning the beach all day, adolescents, teens, and young lifeguards would eventually approach each other, introduce themselves, and exchange any information about meet ups happening that night.

As North Carolina's COVID-19 hospitalizations reached a high of 857 on Thursday, Gov. Roy Cooper and his staff strongly urged the public to wear masks to curb the spread of the disease.


   


  At an afternoon news conference, Cooper also discussed the possibility that he would make masks mandatory in the near future, but he stopped short of saying he would.


   


  "The mandatory nature of it is being considered and studied," Cooper said, adding he would have more information next week when the administration issues more comprehensive policy on the next steps the state will take to handle the ongoing pandemic.


   


  Some North Carolina communities already require people to wear masks because of COVID-19.


   


  Meanwhile, the state prison system has begun the process of testing all of its 31,200 inmates, Commissioner of Prisons Todd Ishee said at the news conference. This will take 60 days and cost about $3.3 million, he said. Burlington-based LabCorp has the contract to analyze the tests, he said.


   


  There have been concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in county jails and state prisons. In a lawsuit that civil rights activists filed on behalf of several prison inmates, a Superior Court judge on June 8 ordered the state to make a plan to keep the inmates safe, WRAL reported.


   


  Masks debate


   


  The issue of wearing face masks has become controversial, even political.


   


  Ashley Smith, the head of the ReOpen NC organization (which has protested against the restrictions Cooper set that closed businesses in an effort to slow the virus), said in a video on Facebook on Monday that any requirement to wear a mask would infringe on personal liberty and freedom.


   


  Then Smith set fire to a mask for a "burn your mask challenge," and she urged others to make burning mask videos for social media.


   


  "Hashtag your videos 'IgnightFreedom,' 'ReOpenNC'," Smith said.


   


  Cooper and state Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen said masks make it harder for infected people -- who might be unaware they are infected -- to spread the virus to others.


   


  "We want this to be second nature to people," Cooper said. "No. 1, it's something everybody can do to pitch in to slow the spread of the virus. And No. 2, doing it doesn't hurt the economy in any way."


   


  Cooper acknowledged there are challenges in making an enforceable mandate to wear masks. A regulation must account for a variety of circumstances, such as people's ages, people's disabilities, and the locations that the masks should be required, he said.


   


  "You just can't snap your finger and say, 'Hey, it's a rule, everybody do it,'" Cooper said. "It's got to be something that's well thought-through, and something that will be effective with the least intrusion that we can have on people."


   


  To persuade people to wear masks, Cooper said, soon there will be public service announcements with hockey players, race car drivers and restaurant owners encouraging people to do so.


   


  Restrictions battle


   


  The legislature on Thursday sent Cooper a bill that would allow bowling alleys, skating rinks and baseball stadiums to reopen with safety requirements. Another bill pending before Cooper would allow gyms, health clubs and bars to reopen, also with safety restrictions.


   


  The governor criticized these bills.


   


  "It's pretty easy to vote for a bill that lifts a restriction when you don't have to deal with the consequences," he said. "And I think it's important for us to be thinking of the consequences of everything we do, and also local and state officials need to have the flexibility to react, which these pieces of legislation impede."


   


  Cooper previously vetoed a bill to allow bars to reopen and ease the restrictions on restaurants.


   


  As of Thursday morning, North Carolina has had 48,188 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 693,678 tests had been reported, 1,333 new cases, and 857 people hospitalized with it. There have been 1,175 COVID deaths in the state, the governor said.


   


  "As we dig into our data, we're seeing that recent increases in our cases are really being driven largely by younger folks, people ages 25 to 49," Cohen, the Health and Human Services secretary, said.


   


  Although younger people have a lower risk of a severe bout with COVID-19, they can still spread it to people at a higher risk of a bad case, Cohen said.

At issue is the western sector of the disputed border, between Indian- controlled Ladakh and Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin. The escalating troop deployment, tension, and death toll have pushed tensions to their highest levels in over 50 years. While both China and India have shown a clear interest in de-escalation and dialogue — demonstrated by their relatively calm and non-escalatory statements after the deadly skirmish on June 16 — the latest developments mark a new low in bilateral ties. Restoring a fraught peace now will be easier said than done.

The early 1950s was the golden age of Freeport basketball under Freeport native Harry Kinert.
   
 From 1950 through 1952, Kinert, who was a Freeport track star, holding the school 100-yard dash record for more than 30 years, coached the Pretzels to three straight state appearances and a 78-10 overall record.
   
 The crown jewel was the middle team. The 1951 Pretzels went 31-2 and won the school's third and last state championship. The Pretzels did it in style, too, winning their Elite Eight, semifinal and championship games by 14, 28 and 20 points.
   
 The Pretzels, though, came perilously close to being just another great team that wasn't quite good enough, having to rally to beat Edwardsville, 67-64, in the first round at supersectionals, considered the first round of the state one-class tournament. This game has been picked as our greatest boys basketball game in Freeport area history.
   
 "That game really set the stage for the final three games," said Gene Schmitt, a forward on the team. "We knew they were a good team, but we weren't expecting that big of a challenge. After that game, we figured out we'd better be ready to play."
   
 Indeed, Freeport finished the regular season 22-2 and ranked No. 2 in the state by the Associated Press. The No. 1 team was Morton Berwyn-Cicero, which went 20-0 and handed Freeport one of its two losses, a 70-52 beatdown in Cicero.
   
 But Berwyn-Cicero didn't even win its regional, leaving Freeport as the top ranked team in Champaign. Edwardsville, meanwhile, despite a 25-5 record, wasn't ranked among the state's top 16 teams.
   
 The game started out as the easy win the Pretzels expected. Freeport, playing the fast-breaking style that Kinert preferred, raced out to a 21-14 lead at the end of the first quarter. Edwardsville slowed the onslaught in the second quarter, "using block plays with good effects to spring its scorers loose," according to the game story.
   
 Trailing 37-33 at halftime, the Tigers caught a break when star Freeport center McKinley "Deacon" Davis picked up his fourth foul in the third quarter. In tight games, the Pretzels rarely played more than six people in 1951. Future Iowa star Carl Cain, who was a junior in 1951, couldn't even crack the rotation. So the Pretzels stuck with Davis, who would go on to star at Iowa and play for the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Tigers tried hard to get that fifth foul by feeding 6-3 center Jack Butler.
   
 With Butler having his way inside as Davis played not to foul, Edwardsville grabbed a 48-45 lead and the crowd of 6,395 fans started thinking upset.
   
 Harlan "Hod" Fritz, like Schmitt, doesn't remember much of the particulars, but he did remember that Freeport didn't panic when they fell behind with Davis in foul trouble.
   
 "The beauty of that team is that we had four guys that, if you didn't watch them closely, could kill you," Fritz said. "People forget we were undefeated as sophomores and Deacon was out for part of that season."
   
 Indeed, on this night, the leading scorer for Freeport would be junior guard Tom Williams with 17 points.
   
 "Tom was the one who never got enough credit," Fritz said of Williams, who was the only Pretzels starter not to go on to play at least some basketball in college. "Tom could shoot from the outside. He was our fastest player. He could go inside and get rebounds, and, on defense, he was the kind of player who studied his man and could get the steal when we needed it."
   
 The Pretzels regained the lead and several contributed down the stretch. Up 61-60, Ben Dorsey pushed the lead to 63-60 with a drive through the middle. Schmitt hit a free throw to push it 64-60. After an Edwardsville basket, Davis and Dorsey added free throws to increase the lead to 67-62.
   
 "From what I remember, that game was won at the free throw line," said Fritz, who along with Schmitt, is the only surviving 1951 starter. He's right. Freeport was a solid but not spectacular 15 of 26 from the line. The Tigers made just eight of 18.
   
 Edwardsville scored a meaningless basket at the buzzer. All five Pretzels scored in double figures. Williams had 17, Davis 16, Schmitt 12 and Dorsey and Fritz 11. The only other Pretzel to see time against Edwardsville was James Hill, who picked up a foul.
   
 Davis, Dorsey and Schmitt led Freeport to a 65-51 win over Marion in the quarterfinals with 17, 16 and 15 points.
   
 Fritz was the star in the semis with 25 points in Freeport's record-setting 88-60 win over Decatur. The 88 points was an Illinois state tournament record at that time.
   
 "I could have had 30, but Harry pulled out the starters for the fourth quarter," Fritz said.
   
 The title game was just as anti-climactic. Freeport led by 14 at halftime and cruised to a 71-51 win over Moline behind 24 points from Davis. In the four games, Davis averaged 18.3 points, Dorsey 13.8, Fritz 13.5 and Williams 13.0.
   
 In 1952, Freeport returned again to Champaign, this time led by Cain, who would go on to be an All-Big 10 player at Iowa and win a Gold Medal in the Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. The Pretzels fell to Quincy, 74-68, in the first round.
   
 "Tom Williams was a senior in 1952, but he was going to graduate after the first semester and he didn't go out because he wasn't going to be around for the playoffs," Fritz said. "If Tom could have played all year, I think they would have won it again."
   
 Quincy would get to the finals where they lost to the famous Alden-Hebron team in overtime. With only 98 students -- but three future Big Ten players in the Judson twins and 6-foot-10 center Bill Schulz -- Alden-Hebron is easily the smallest champion in the history of one-class basketball in Illinois.
   
 "That wasn't just a golden era for Freeport, that was a golden era of small- town basketball," Schmitt said. "Mount Vernon won it in 1950 when we were there as juniors. We won and then Alden-Hebron won. Basketball changed a lot when the Chicago schools started getting better coaches."
   
 One of those coaches was Kinert. After the 1952 season, Kinert took the basketball coaching job at Oak Park-River Forest.
   
 Kinert coached there through the 1969 season. He guided his 1956 team to the state tournament, but that's as close as he came to duplicating the 1951 Pretzels run. All of Freeport mourned when Kinert died of a heart attack at age 52 in October of 1969.
   
 "Harry was our coach when we were sophomores and we wanted him to be our coach when we were juniors," Schmitt remembers. "It kind of became a political thing, but he ended up getting the job. We knew then we were going to be good. He was a younger guy who communicated well with us and he knew how we played.
   
 "It was just a great time to be at Freeport."

“When it comes to J.P. Coen, they are blind to the pain of people,” added De Cuba, who was born on the Caribbean island of Aruba and has lived in the Netherlands for years.
 Karwan Fatah-Black, a historian and lecturer at Leiden University, thinks the many protests in the Netherlands in the wake of Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25 are a response to the voices of migrants and descendants of people from former Dutch colonies being marginalized in Dutch society.
 “Their concerns were always brushed aside for a very long time,” Fatah-Black said. Among the concerns he listed: Racial profiling by police and tax authorities, discrimination in workplaces, schools and on the housing rental market, and cases of police brutality.
 The demonstration, set to take place in Coen's hometown of Hoorn, follows protests across the Netherlands in recent weeks against police violence and racism, including two in Amsterdam that drew thousands of participants. A statue of Piet Hein, a colonial era mariner widely regarded as a hero, was daubed with red paint and the word “killer” last week.
 Prof. Remco Raben, who teaches Dutch colonial and post-colonial history at the University of Amsterdam, said the protests targeting statues are "a kind of correction of the vision of the nation as it emerged in the 19th century and not as a rewriting of the history. It’s the rewriting of the image of the nation.”
 “That’s where it ties in with the post-colonial communities in the Netherlands, because they see that they are not presented in the public, political sphere, … so they demand for correction of that,” Raben said.

Trident Technical College will again offer students a chance to take classes for free this fall if they enroll in specific in-demand career training programs. The college first offered free tuition in fall 2019. The initiative was so successful the college extended the program to the 2020 spring and summer semesters.
 “This is a timely opportunity for Lowcountry residents who need new skills to be successful in the job market,” said Trident Tech President Mary Thornley. In addition to offering free tuition, Thornley said the college decided not to pursue a tuition increase for the upcoming academic year in light of the financial uncertainty faced by so many in the community. The college already has the lowest college tuition rates in the tri-county area. Most S.C. residents qualify for S.C. Lottery-Funded Tuition Assistance of $110 per credit hour, allowing a TTC student to take a full load of 12 credit hours for only $961.58 a semester.
 The college plans to offer free tuition for the entire 2020-21 academic year. Students can receive free tuition by enrolling in one of 70 programs of study in the fields of manufacturing, information technology, culinary and hospitality, emergency medical technology and technical trades. The college is able to offer students free tuition through a combination of federal, state and college financial aid funds.
 To take advantage of the offer, potential students must submit a free TTC admission application and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Those who qualify will be awarded financial aid to cover the full cost of tuition, registration fees and course fees. Students are responsible for the cost of books and digital course materials. To see a list of programs eligible for free tuition and for additional information visit bit.ly/FreeTuitionFall2020.
 Full Fall and Fall 1 classes begin Aug. 24. Fall 2 classes begin Oct. 20. To speak with a Trident Tech representative, call 843-574-6111.

They run the gamut from properly smart to outright annoying, especially when their stated premise clumsily misleads you. The game's attempts at this are either too oblique or obvious. An example of the latter is found fairly early on when the game tells you that the next question requires a more complex mathematical approach than the one you've just solved. In reality, the solution isn't in any way linked to either the written premise or the previous challenge. Some might enjoy having to guess whether they're being misled, as do I when it's done well, but you need to have enough clues to deduce that this is the case.

Social science typically also focuses on probabilistic explanations or patterns of behavior. While these patterns may provide useful approximations of how a situation should be expected to play out over many cases, uncertainty in predicting behavior in a particular case can be quite significant. Social science does offer great insight into probabilistic risk taking, but it can also miss specific features of individual cases or fail to account for contingent factors that can have significant consequences. Historical cases can help joint officers develop a deep appreciation for the challenges of leadership, the importance of contingency, and the challenges of acting under conditions of great confusion and uncertainty. But knowledge of history and the analysis of comparative historical case studies are not in competition with social science; they are social science. And social sciences also provide thoughtful methods to identify and select relevant cases, and to identify when the lessons a particular case may not apply. As a result, social science and history can be used in tandem.

It hits me that I must have some of my father in me when it comes to hanging on to old vehicles. When he died in 1995, he was still driving the yellow Toyota Celica he bought new in 1971. Maybe it had something to do with living through the Great Depression in the 1930s, or perhaps he followed the Swedish proverb, "don't buy a pig while it's still in the bag." In other words, don’t make rash decisions. So, okay, think long and hard before deciding to buy a new vehicle.
 If you hadn't noticed by now, Father's Day coming up Sunday, and if you are a dad, I hope you get what you deserve. Like most of the guys I know, I've experienced fatherhood both ways. Being a father and having a father. When you're little, your father sets the standard, and when you're grown up, you might use your father as a template, but after that, you're on your own and have to sort out how to do it right.
 Although my dad was “my dad,” I remember thinking the best fathers were on TV. There was Ward Cleaver and Ben Cartwright, and Steve Douglas and Rob Petrie. But I must admit that the best fatherly advice I heard as a kid was from Lucas McCain, the dad in The Rifleman. And of course, Sheriff Andy Taylor. But my dad was not Andy, and I sure as heck wasn't Opie.
 Those TV dads had common sense and were understanding and patient (thanks to the time and trouble the writers of those shows put into it) and made me a little envious. But in a way, they made me appreciate my own dad because they weren't living inside our house with my mother and brothers and sisters.
 But on the other hand, for a great many of us, there were times when things weren't all rosy with our dads. Times like, for instance, ahem...puberty, when mom and dad both seem a little weird, and I know that now because I probably seemed a bit weird to my own kids during those years.
 My dad is no longer around, but I find myself thinking about him, his ways, his corny expressions, more than ever. That stuff stays deep inside and pops up unexpectedly, probably at those moments when we need it.
 So, whatever the case may be, this Sunday don't forget to tell your dad you love him, or forgive him, or thank him. Because I'm sure he's done the best he knows how to do.
 If he were still around today, something tells me my dad would still be wanting to be puttin' around in that rattletrap of a car. And no COVID-19 mask, no. Knowing him, he would be wearing the gas mask he’d hung onto since WWII. Just in case.

  Visitors to the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument near Las Cruces, New Mexico, will get the feel of being on top of the world hiking up trails offering beautiful views.


  This angular granite mountain range's rocky spires stand almost 9,000 feet tall against the Chihuahuan Desert floor. The peaks include the Robledo Mountains, Sierra de las Uvas, Portrillo Mountains and Doña Ana Mountains. Hikers will find narrow canyons mixed with open woodlands. From the desert to the ponderosa pines in the highest elevations, the land offers many opportunities for visitors from photography to horseback riding and mountain biking, camping, hiking and wildlife viewing.


  The Portrillo Mountains stand as the most remote section of the Monument. The area is southwest of Las Cruces and known for its volcanic landscape including cinder cones, lava flows and craters. The Doña Ana Mountains is a pedestrian, equestrian and biker's paradise. Rock climbing routes and even some motorized use areas can take visitors to some of the higher elevations. Bird watching, backpacking, camping, hunting and fishing opportunities are plentiful.


  The park was established May 21, 2014, and consists of 496,330 acres. The Dripping Springs Visitors Center on the western edge of the Organ Mountains is open all year, except winter holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Dripping Springs Natural Area is an opportunity for visitors to take a great hike with beautiful views of the Rio Grande River and Mesilla Valley. Trails offer easy to moderate hikes and are scenic with wildlife. The path is gravel, so good closed toes shoes are best. If you can walk two miles at 5,000 feet, you can do this hike. There are shaded benches along the way.


  This national monument not only provides a variety of things to do for travelers but also protects prehistoric, historic, geologic and biologic resources. These scientific resources are divided onto the four mountain areas.


  Just northwest of Las Cruces, the canyons and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands offer beautiful views. Hikers can find petroglyphs from three Native American cultures and stagecoach and wagon tracks in the grasslands from the Butterfield Stage Station.


  The park has 10 wilderness areas including the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument, established in 2009. The idea was to protect and conserve the area, which hosts a deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized footprint megatrackways within about 5,280 acres. The area has footprints of amphibians, reptiles and insects, as well as plants and petrified wood that date back 280 million years. It is home to one of the most scientifically significant early Permian track sites in the world.


  Although there are plenty of hiking, horseback riding and off-roading opportunities on these areas there are no areas, yet, that are developed to see the fossils. They are being preserved for study. Some fossils have been removed and are shown in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque. For those interested in viewing the tracks, the Las Cruces Museum of Nature and Science has a 30 foot and a 15 foot trackway on display.


  Two other popular trails for a walk or hike are the La Cueva trail, offering a cave to explore, and the Fillmore trail, which has a mine and waterfall.


  Make sure to have water, good hiking boots or shoes, binoculars, snacks or a picnic. For information on the monument areas call the Bureau of Land Management at 575-522-1219 or visit blm.gov.

The Ladakh clash should not have been a surprise. Similar events have been happening along the disputed border between China and India for years, but only the few most heated ones make the news. Beijing believes India is exploiting a temporary period of Chinese weakness, and is responding forcefully as a result. Strategically, it may not help China’s desired goal to keep India neutral. But since Beijing sees a neutral India as untenable to begin with, tactical gains that can bog India down along the disputed border, frustrate New Delhi’s regional and global ambitions, and remind India of the eventual need for compromise may not be the worst case in China’s cost-benefit analysis. Tactically, China appears to be aiming for what it achieved in the 1962 war. Despite what the outsiders might see as China’s mistake, China is unlikely to change its current strategic assessment. China and India will eventually find a face-saving mutual compromise to end the Ladakh standoff, as neither wants a war. However, the unsettled border will continue to destabilize, fester, and brew more clashes down the road.

On the back of growing population and economic development around the world combined with rising energy demand among residential, commercial and public services, and transport sector, the global Robotic Drilling market is estimated to witness exuberant growth over the forecast period, i.e., 2020-2028. According to IEA (International Energy Agency), the worldwide energy demand grew by 4% (900TWh) in 2018. In the same year, the estimation of total electricity production across the globe was attained through coal and natural gas, with coal contributing to 25.6% and natural gas with 27.9% of the total production. Additionally, there is a rising demand for clean, sustainable and eco-friendly energy generation due to increased concerns pertaining to rise in CO2 emissions from energy generation.

At least three pieces of empirical evidence side against this theory. First, since the beginning of the standoff, the Chinese government has resorted to a low-key approach toward the tensions instead of stoking domestic nationalism with sensational media headlines and organized internet news, which would be indispensable components of a premediated and coordinated campaign. Second, since COVID-19, China has been stirring up tensions to boost internal solidarity, but this has been focused primarily on Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and the United States. One could argue that China has opened too many “fronts” diplomatically, but militarily, China has always been careful to avoid a two-front confrontation with America in the east and India in the west. Given Beijing’s plan to initiate the Hong Kong security law during the parliamentary sessions in May, and the rising uncertainty across the Taiwan strait in light of President Tsai Ing-wen’s second inauguration on May 20, it is unlikely that Beijing intentionally planned for the Ladakh standoff to happen at this time. Third, China’s top South Asia experts were not consulted until roughly ten days after the beginning of the standoff. The late involvement of the policy community suggests that the standoff was not based on advanced planning.

“Honestly, I wasn’t taught a whole lot about Juneteenth, it just _was_ ,” she said. “Where I grew up, you learned about Juneteenth by the community. School was inconsequential in that sense, it was a community education.
 “I remember every year I’d go [to the celebration] and there was always a parade and music and dancing. And to a kid, that’s an exciting time. I remember being invigorated by this sense of community.”
 Inspired by the real Miss Juneteenth competition, the indie drama stars Nicole Beharie as Turquoise Jones, a former beauty queen who has failed to achieve success beyond her pageant win. Turquoise is a single mother struggling to make ends meet while clinging fiercely to the hope that her rebellious teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) can replicate her win and create a different outcome for herself.
 “I loved Turquoise as a character because she exemplifies someone who a lot of people would just pass by without realizing the richness of her life,” said Beharie by phone from Georgia. “There are not a lot of movies about the women that keep things afloat. I was raised by a single mother so I just wanted to breathe some life into that as best I could. It feels like with a great deal of storytelling, there are perspectives that are missing or they’re always told in the exact same way.”

A Canadian city -- Toronto, Edmonton or Vancouver -- is now a near-certainty as one of the NHL's two hubs for the proposed 24-team playoff tournament.
 The federal government opened that door after an Order In Council was issued Thursday, aimed at loosening the 14-day quarantine for arrivals in Canada during the COVID-19 recovery. As reported by The Canadian Press, the order was awaiting the governor general's signature as of Thursday evening. Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino has issued a letter stating it's in the "national interest" to have a Canadian hub.
 Negotiations with the NHL have quietly been going on for weeks, while within the three provinces -- Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia -- health authorities joined with their federal counterparts in approving a league plan to get players from the U.S. and Europe into what would be called a 'cohort quarantine.'
 A key part is making practice facilities for training camps, which are due to start July 10, and later the hotels and main rink for the tournament part of the 'bubble' where teams will be restricted to staying.
 There will be 12 teams, including the host club, in each hub, with Las Vegas the current favourite to be the American site. As previously announced by the league, teams can bring no more than 50 players and staff to the hubs.
 Lifting the 14-day rule in Canada would permit players who've chosen to train in the U.S. up to now, including Maple Leafs leading scorer Auston Matthews and goaltender Frederik Andersen, the chance to immediately join the small- group workouts of five to six on the ice, rather than sit out a two-week isolation.
 While getting at least one spot north of the border will be a morale booster for hockey-starved fans in the chosen city and boost the economy, particularly its empty hotels, there's likely to be some opposition. Some will claim the NHL is getting preferential treatment at a time when densely populated regions of Ontario, including Toronto, are still in a tight Stage 1 lockdown.
 The NHL will also have to satisfy its own players that there will be frequent COVID-19 testing and that every precaution is taken between the hotel and the rink. Sensitive to concerns that the testing for players and staff will take away from health resources for local citizens, the NHL has said it will pay for its own examinations and the Leafs had offered some testing services not in use on a given day could be accessed by the public.
 But the date of the tournament is still up in the air with the COVID crisis still evident and cases on the rise in some American cities. The NHL Players Association still must negotiate a deal to return, covering how training camps are conducted next month, the tournament schedule, safety issues and how their families might be accommodated in the hub cities.

In the long run, South Africa could bolster its macroeconomic strategy by implementing these necessary SOE reforms and restructure these entities so they remain effective instruments for our national developmental agenda. State control of SOEs needs to be reviewed and possible reduced over time by bringing in private investment. Our government needs to reflect deeply on its role as the sole shareholder and direct player in the economy.

Last week we left off with Beverley "Babe" Trumble bleeding to death in the foyer of his roadhouse, the Chappell House in Sandwich.


  It was the early hours of the morning of Nov. 6, 1920, and Rev. J.O.L. Spracklin, aka "The Fighting Parson", had just shot him at close range.


  The reverend and his gang of thugs, who officially were designated as special constables, left the scene quickly, without preserving any of the evidence, and Spracklin soon gave himself up to the Windsor police, not to the Sandwich police (remember, they were separate jurisdictions in those days), because he knew he was persona non grata in Sandwich.


  Meanwhile, Trumble was laid down in the living room, in his living quarters at the roadhouse. Doctors were called, but it was too late. Twenty minutes after they arrived, Trumble was dead.


  That same Saturday, later in the day, an inquest was held into the shooting. Spracklin had engaged a lawyer from Chatham, R.H. Brackin, who demanded that there be 12 jurors, instead of the usual eight.


  At 9 p.m., with the Sandwich courthouse packed, the first witness walked to the stand. She was Lulu Trumble, wife of the deceased. Bringing her two young sons with her to the witness stand, she made a pitiful sight.


  She testified that her husband had been filling a hot water bottle for her because she was sick, when they heard voices downstairs. Following her husband down, she saw men with guns drawn.


  Beverley questioned what they were doing inside, with guns drawn, and asked to see their badges. As he moved towards them, Spracklin shot him.


  Lulu denied that her husband had a gun in his hand; the only thing in his hand was the hot water bottle he was filling. Several of Trumble's associates who were there at the time of the shooting also testified that Trumble did not have a gun.


  When Spracklin's men came to the stand, they all testified that Trumble did have a gun, and that he was waving it at several of them, and that he had told Spracklin that he was going to shoot him.


  Spracklin himself, when he testified, was careful to emphasize that Trumble was pointing a gun at him, and that it was a case of shoot or be shot, so he shot Trumble, out of self-defence. What wasn't in question was that Spracklin and his men vacated the premises immediately after the shooting.


  By then it was after midnight, and one of the prime witnesses to the shooting, Ed Smith, had not yet been located, so the inquest was held over until Monday.


  The Windsor police released Spracklin to his own recognizance, and Spracklin used the day Sunday to go to Chatham.


  The Toronto press, of which I spoke last week, had all reported on the incident, and they all had basically excused Spracklin, and some even made him out to be the victim. After all, he and his men seemed to be the only people in the Border Cities area truly trying to fight all these bootleggers.


  In Chatham that Sunday, Spracklin attended church services, and basically held court afterwards, with several prominent Methodists in the city, and others besides, who all treated him like a hero. Even the Chief Licence Officer for Ontario, the Rev. J.H. Ayearst, also a Methodist minister, came down from Toronto to support him, and tell him that all the national Methodist organizations were solidly behind him.


  When the inquest reconvened on Monday, Ed Smith took the stand. He also insisted that Trumble did not have a gun, but the doctors who had come that night to try and help Trumble all insisted, when they took the stand, that Smith had told them that he did have a gun.


  Then the jury withdrew to consider their decision, but not before the Chief Coroner, J.S. LaBelle, made it clear that the whole affair was the result of all the illegal bootlegging going on, and neglecting to say anything about the fact that Spracklin and his men had broken into the Chappell House without a warrant and with guns drawn.


  Crown Attorney John S. Rodd, another staunch Methodist, and strict enforcer of the moral code, seconded this commendation, and told the jury Spracklin clearly had the right to be searching the roadhouse, even though the law, section 66 of the Ontario Temperance Act, said he didn't.


  It therefore wasn't surprising when the jury returned an hour later to state that they felt that Trumble's death was a justifiable homicide, and that Spracklin had acted in self-defence. And in the days that followed, both LaBelle and Rodd made it clear that they thought the matter had been decided, and that there was no need for any further trials.


  However, Brackin, Spracklin's defence lawyer figured that, sooner or later, manslaughter charges would be brought forward. Brackin was right.


  Spracklin was given a leave of absence from his liquor inspector's position, "in order to recuperate". But he and his men never worked again in liquor enforcement.


  But Spracklin continued to be lionized in the press. Only one outlet, the Toronto magazine Saturday Night, came out to say that perhaps the temperance people were going too far, and were acting too violently and recklessly. They called out the Methodist church and the press for lauding Rev. Spracklin for his courage, and never once expressing even an iota of sympathy for Trumble's widow and her two young children.


  A few weeks later, the province announced that it was bringing the manslaughter charge forward, and that Spracklin would have his trial at the February 1921 assizes. That trial did go forward in February.


  All of the same witnesses were called, and they all said basically the same thing they had at the inquest. One key difference was in the testimony of Jack Bannon, another of Trumble's men.


  Bannon testified that while Trumble was not holding a gun when he saw him shortly after he was shot, Mrs. Trumble did have a gun in her hand. This created enough uncertainty with regard to Spracklin's claim of self-defence, and the jury, once again deliberating for only about an hour, came back to say that they had found Spracklin to be not guilty.


  Of course, Spracklin was considered by many in the press and around the province as the hero.


  Not long after his acquittal, Spracklin spoke to a crowd of 1,200 people who crammed into Park Street Methodist Church in Chatham. He toured other cities in Ontario with the same message of God's belief in the importance of complete prohibition of alcohol.


  Although it would seem that this was a clear victory for Spracklin and for temperance, it turned out that this wasn't really the case. Within a year, he left his church in Sandwich under a cloud of suspicion. He was charged with negligence, and with a vaguely expressed charge of impropriety with certain women of the congregation.


  He moved to Cheboygan, Mich., and lived the rest of his life in that area. And temperance? Well, it is generally considered that the shooting of "Babe" Trumble by "The Fighting Parson" on Nov. 6, 1920 in Sandwich, was the high- water mark for the movement in Ontario.


  By 1927, prohibition of alcohol in Ontario was declared over, and the era of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario had begun.
