“A big staple was work clothes,” he said.
 That included dungarees — like bibs but just the bottom half — and painter pants, which were the same thing only white instead of denim, he explained.
 Cohen was well known and well liked in the community, McClellan said.
 “There wasn’t anyone in town who didn’t know Harry,” he said.
 And Harry liked the community members, too, and treated them with generosity, Nogg said.
 “After World War II, soldiers were coming back and needed a suit to get a job,” she said. “Harry would let them charge it and pay when they could.”
 Cohen also sometimes gave families burial suits when a man passed away. Nogg remembered a case when a man needed to buy a burial suit for a relative and didn’t have quite enough money.
 “Harry said, ‘I just changed the price to exactly that amount (that the customer had),’” she said.
 Cohen retained ownership of the store until his passing in 1974. His grandson, Richard “Pete” Lee then took ownership and oversaw its operation. During a renovation in 1976-77, Iowa Clothes expanded from two to all four of the facility’s bays (530, 532, 534 and 536 W. Broadway), becoming its sole commercial occupant. Midlands Mall had just opened a block away, and business leaders had high hopes for downtown Council Bluffs.
 In 1996, with the Midlands Mall — thought to be the key to reviving downtown — empty and increasing competition from retail chains, Lee became despondent and took his own life. Since none of the other family members had pursued careers in retail, the family held a liquidation sale and closed the store.
 The redevelopment of the former Iowa Clothes building will be the first phase of what is planned as a three-phase revitalization of the 500 block of West Broadway.
 The 712 Initiative, a nonprofit redevelopment organization for Council Bluffs, plans to start renovating the structure early next year, reopening it as commercial and residential space in early 2022.
 The historic character of the building will be maintained in the redevelopment, returning large storefront windows to the street level, encouraging walkability and window shopping. Murphy beds may even be purchased for the apartments to lend them additional authenticity. There will be four workspace areas on the ground floor that could be used for small offices or by artists or craftsmen.
 When completed by 2022, the renovated building will feature 10 studio apartments ranging in size from 500 to 620 square feet; one one-bedroom apartment of 700 square feet; and four two-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 720 to 770 square feet. Garst said that some of the apartments would be affordable, while the remainder would be at market rate.
 The Iowa Department of Economic Development has approved $750,000 in Brownfield tax credits for the project. The 712 Initiative is applying to have the building designated as a local landmark and is approaching area foundations for additional funding, Garst said. The group anticipates using state and federal tax credits, too. The project is only eligible for $1.3 million in financing, she said.
 The 712 Initiative will be following that with improvements, slated for 2022, to 12 Scott St., the former Council Bluffs Community School District’s administrative headquarters, and new construction at 510 W. Broadway — now a parking lot — bringing 116 new residential units to downtown.
 Improvements to 12 Scott Street will add 23 market rate units, including 16 one-bedroom apartments and seven two-bedroom apartments. The renovation would also include a 725 square foot roof deck. The project has a projected cost of $5 million.
 The new construction proposed for 510 W. Broadway — the third and final phase of the redevelopment — would be a five-story structure with covered parking at ground level and 78 apartment units as well as a community room on the floors above. With a projected cost of $16.9 million, The 712 Initiative anticipates the three-phase project will be completed in seven years.

The 809 factory is located in a canyon with karst landform, large site height difference and complex geological conditions. The canyon is named Xialao Creek, with beautiful and comfortable environment. It is one of the best summer resorts for Yichang citizens. There are streams in the canyon, with water flowing all year round, and the water quality is excellent, suitable for swimming and leisure. Before the renovation, there had been a large number of farmhouses and small resorts in the area. The 809 factory is located in the middle part of Xialao Creek, which is closely related to the stream and has a good natural environment and industrial foundation.

Wineries around Cape Town fear a nine-week alcohol sales ban will leave a bad hangover that outlasts the coronavirus pandemic, as South African bottles lose their spots on international shelves and thousands of jobs are lost.
 Africa's most industrialised economy shuttered liquor stores at the start of a strict anti-coronavirus lockdown on March 27 to limit the spread of COVID-19, and reduce pressure on busy emergency wards.
 The controversial booze ban was lifted on June 1st as part of a gradual easing of confinement measures to limit the economic setbacks of the pandemic.
 But wine producers in the valleys of South Africa's Western Cape province are concerned the industry will struggle to bounce back.
 The alcohol sales ban was coupled with a six-week export freeze -- raising concern buyers could turn to suppliers in other countries if demand abroad was not rapidly met.
 "We were the only country in the world where wine exports were not allowed," said Boyce Lloyd, CEO of South African top wine and spirits producer KWV.
 Lloyd said buyers in key importing countries such as Canada, Finland and Sweden removed bottles that did not meet a minimum sales rate.
 "When you do not have stock on the shelf obviously you can't record a sale and then you get delisted," he said.
 "That is a very real risk we are facing."
 \- De-listings and delays -
 At the Nabygelegen wine cellar in the southern town of Wellington, owner James Mckenzie said international buyers had grown nervous about "putting all their eggs in one basket".
 "They are now looking at importing other countries' wines in case there is a problem again," Mckenzie told AFP. "Those are long-term decisions which may affect us over the next years."
 The risk of being delisted has been exacerbated by delays at ports due to coronavirus outbreaks among staff.
 The Western Cape is the hotspot of South Africa's epidemic, with more than half of the 92,681 cases.
 Cape Town harbour staffers have not been spared.
 "What we have been seeing in the last few weeks is major hold-ups at harbour terminals," said Wines of South Africa spokeswoman Maryna Calow, a non-profit that promotes wine exports. "They are currently running on a 50 percent capacity".
 Only 55 percent of KWV wine exported this month had arrived on time, down from the usual 90 percent, according to Lloyd.
 Delays could be as long as three weeks, he added.
 The ongoing closure of South Africa's borders and lockdowns across the world have also made it difficult for wine producers to import packaging material.
 "I'm talking about cork from Portugal, glass from Europe," Calow explained. "There is a major delay and backlog there."
 Meanwhile, cellars bursting with unsold wine barrels could cause a drop in bulk price due to oversupply by year-end.
 The combined effect could be devastating for South Africa's famed wine industry, which employs around 300,000 people.
 \- Glimmer of hope -
 "We are estimating around 18,000 jobs to be lost due to... bans on the sale of alcohol," Calow said, adding that 80 percent of wine cellars risked shutting their doors in the long term.
 A bleak scenario that could be compounded by the accelerating spread of coronavirus, as South Africa hurtles towards an expected peak of infections in July.
 Every confirmed case forces a winery to shut down operations for at least a day to sanitise premises and isolate contacts.
 Lloyd estimated the company had lost between 10 and 15 percent of production time over the three weeks.
 Suppliers of boxes and labels are also affected.
 "So you might be waiting for certain raw materials to arrive today for packaging tomorrow and you get a call from the supplier saying they are impacted by COVID."
 One glimmer of hope has been a spike in online wine sales, which skyrocketed after the alcohol sales ban was lifted.
 But courier companies have struggled to keep up.
 "People have not had access to liquor for two months, so you are dealing with a substantial build up of orders," said Lloyd.

The COVID-19 pandemic has a long way to go. Even though rates of infection and death have dropped globally and nationally, the spread of coronavirus wasn’t stopped. Only a very effective vaccine or widespread immunity from having the infection will do that.
 There surely will be some additional cases resulting from the end of statewide lockdowns and life resumed with adaptations to reduce contagion. And disease experts say the virus probably will return in the fall and winter, a potential second wave.
 It’s still too early to make judgments about which of the widely varied approaches of states and nations to minimizing the harms of the pandemic is best. That will be difficult even looking back on the history of this unique era.

Simons is employed by a young railroad surveyor, Grenville Mellon Dodge as a cook for the crew. He remains in Dodge’s employ for some time, cooking for a living and sketching in his free time. When the Civil War breaks out, Simon joins the 29th Iowa volunteers, eventually marching all the way to New Orleans. Simons recorded the horrors of war in his diary: “During the battle the soldiers were forced to drink water from the mud holes among the slain which was actually stained with the blood of the dead rebbles [sic].” He took a stab at poetry and discovered religion. “Kind reader.” he wrote, “The Lord will answer prayers. I know he will, because he has answered mine.”
 After the war, Simons returns to his adopted home of Council Bluffs, sketching and drawing for nearly the rest of his life. His final days are spent in Long Beach, California, where he is buried.
 Simons was born in Canada, or maybe Illinois, in 1834. The call that brought him hundreds of miles to Iowa echoes the call heeded by many others — opportunity. The eastern United States was filling up and young men like Simons and Dodge would “go west,” as Horace Greeley would famously advise a decade later.

The design starts from the site planning, considers the integration of architecture, interior, landscape and lighting, retains the industrial characteristics and historical information of the original building to the maximum extent, and carries out transformation and reuse.First of all, the design protected the industrial heritages and preserved the original appearance of the buildings through structural reinforcement and other measures. After that, the original building spaces were selectively used to implant new functions, incl. changing the original dormitory into hotel rooms, the original boiler-house into auditorium, the original office building and equipment rooms into restaurant, reception center, etc. On this basis, new public buildings are set up at important nodes of the site to form space and visual anchor points, such as hotel lobby, book bar at the entrance of the area, tea bar at the top of the cliff, and so on. The new building and the old building are deliberately distinguished in form and material, forming a dramatic dialogue relationship, and clearly indicating the spatial characteristics and architectural language of the two different historical stages.

Mayor Rick Kriseman said he also plans to require people to cover their faces in businesses and other public spaces.
 “We can wear a mask, protect others and ourselves, or we can contribute to someone’s death. Maybe even our own,” Kriseman said.
 The Democrat said Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has encouraged people to use masks but not mandated them.
 DeSantis said he has no intention of closing Florida’s economy again despite the statewide spike in new cases, which topped 1,000 Wednesday for the 15th consecutive day. He said many of those getting sick are young and unlikely to suffer serious illness or death.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.
 Fears about growing numbers of infections in younger people pushed officials in the San Antonio area to order masks in public as infections keep rising in Texas.
 “What we are doing here is to protect the life and safety of the San Antonio community,” Mayor Ron Nirenberg said, adding that most infections in the area are in people younger than 40.
 Later Wednesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said local governments could force businesses to require customers and workers to wear masks but that he wouldn’t issue a statewide order. The second-most-populated state set daily records for new COVID-19 cases, with 3,129, and hospitalizations. The 2,793 hospitalizations mark a daily high for the 10th time in 11 days.
 In Montgomery, Alabama, where cases are spiking, the issue of masks erupted during a City Council meeting, where members rejected a proposal to mandate them at public gatherings of 25 or more.
 Dr. Bill Saliski, a lung specialist at Jackson Hospital in Montgomery, called on the city to pass a mask requirement and declared: “If this continues the way we’re going, we’re going to be overrun.”
 Some city leaders voiced concern about trampling on people’s rights.
 “I think to make somebody do something or require somebody to wear something is an overreach,” councilman Brantley Lyons said.
 Since the virus emerged in China late last year and spread worldwide, there have been more than 8.3 million confirmed cases and over 447,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll is much higher. The U.S. death toll has exceeded 117,000.
 European nations, which embarked on a wide-scale reopening this week, watched Asia and the Americas with trepidation.
 After lockdown restrictions were relaxed in Iran, Health Minister Saeed Namaki said he realized the extent of the challenge when he took a domestic flight.
 “Many people have become careless, frustrated with wearing masks,” he said.

Judie B. Turner (1935 2020) Judie B. Turner of Winter Park passed peacefully on June 17, 2020. Judie was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio on September 26, 1935. Judie began playing piano at age 4. By junior high, she had played piano with George Szell, conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, and Leonard Shure of the Cleveland Institute of Music. Judie was a piano major at the University of Michigan. Among her performances at the University of Michigan, Judie performed the Gershwin Concerto in her sophomore year. Judie also was an avid swimmer. She excelled in water ballet in high school and was a member of the University of Michigan synchronized swimming club. She choreographed, directed and performed in numerous synchronized swimming shows at the University of Michigan. She also performed in synchronized swimming shows sponsored by the Red Cross benefitting disabled veterans at venues in Ohio and at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Florida. While attending the University of Michigan, Judie was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority, and the Mu Phi Epsilon music sorority. She was tapped for Wyvern, the Junior Honors Society at University of Michigan. Soon after graduation, Judie married Leo B. West, a graduate of the law school at the University of Wisconsin. Leo and Judie moved to Coral Gables, Florida where Judie became a schoolteacher in the Dade County public school system. She continued playing piano, and composed pop tunes. A full orchestra and chorus performed "From Bach to Boogie", a program she created. Judie was active in the Dade County community. She was Chairwoman of the Mother March of Dimes and on the boards of Mental Health Clinic Foundation, Parkway Home for Dependent Children, American Heart Association, Woman's Crime Commission, Project Hope, Women's Cancer Association, The Guild and Patrons of the Museum of Science, Young Patronesses of the Opera, and American Cancer Society. She co-chaired the American Cancer Society's second largest fundraiser, the "Ten Best Dressed Women of Miami." She also held numerous offices in the Florida Federation of Jr. Women's Clubs, including District Jr. Director, State Vice Director and liaison to the 6 Sunland Training Centers, and State Jr. Parliamentarian. She was awarded "The United Fund Silver Torch Award", voted "Most Outstanding Young Woman of Dade County" and was presented the Key to the City of Coral Gables. Judie moved to Winter Park in 1996, and was appointed to the Board of the Walt Disney Cancer Foundation. She also joined the Council of 101, an outstanding group of women leaders in the Central Florida community. She played piano for Council 101 functions, including the annual Festival of Trees fundraiser for the Orlando Museum of Art. One of her favorite moments at Council of 101 was when she and other members of Council of 101 performed "Red Hot Mama's", a comical mini- musical she created. Judie married Judge W. Rogers Turner in 2004. They moved to the Mayflower in Winter Park and were happily married until his passing in 2018. Judie continued composing and performing beautiful songs for piano, including "One Prayer" and "On Villa Pond", the latter inspired by the numerous birds that frequented the pond she could see from her piano bench in her villa at the Mayflower. She also wrote short stories and poems, including a recent poem written to lift the spirits of her fellow residents at the Mayflower. Judie is survived by her loving son, Brad West, Brad's wife, Lisa, 6 grandchildren, Ryan West, Lindsay West, Chad West, Hannah West, Lauren Jensen and Nicole Stewart, and great grandchild Jack Stewart. She is predeceased by her loving daughter, Dana Jensen. In light of the limitations and safety concerns relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the family is having a private remembrance on July 3, 2020. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to any of the organizations noted above.

In 1853, when Simons first saw this primeval porto-urban scene, Council Bluffs was the most civilized village north of St. Joseph, Missouri. And it would be another year before its citizens would map out the street and lot grid for Omaha City. (That’s right, for all the trouble Omaha gives Council Bluffs today, we laid out Omaha’s first streets.)
 Here in Council Bluffs we are rich in early eyewitness folk art thanks to Simons. The Historic General Dodge House possesses over one-third of Simons’ surviving oil paintings in addition to a late 19th-century set of copies of his sketches. The Council Bluffs Public Library has nearly 50 original pencil sketches in its care. Best of all, our recently minted multi-million Arts & Culture Center (PACE) has brought together both collections for a monumental display, which premiered just days ago. The last time so many of Simons’ works were displayed together for the public to appreciate was in 1961. (Prior to that, Simons landscapes inspired Grant Wood’s murals in the Chieftain hotel.) The current exhibition at PACE is significant for regional history and folk art lovers.
 Simons’ many surviving paintings and sketches depict compelling scenes: the first official delivery of mail to Omaha (with the fledging city in the background), Dodge’s homestead in Elkhorn, Nebraska (hostile Native Americans forced him to abandon it), steamships powering up the Missouri (the best way to travel in that day), Dodge’s first Council Bluffs home on Pierce Street (the “red light” district), NP Dodge’s first real estate office (still doing business today), and Mormons on their long journey to Salt Lake City.
 Sadly, the painting considered his masterpiece has been missing since the late 1920s. We know that Simons painted scenes of the journey from Council Bluffs to Denver City on over 10,000 square feet of canvas. He was very proud of this work eagerly displaying it whenever he could. Perhaps this lost masterpiece lies in some attic or basement, just waiting to be discovered.
 Fortunately, the vast majority of Simons’ work survives and awaits your appreciation of his artistic legacy and our shared heritage. Visit our new and magnificent PACE center and let Simons’ talent transport you back in time. Same place, different day. Few cities bearing the historical significance of Council Bluffs can lay claim to such a visually stunning heritage. For us, here in the Bluffs, the past is only a brush stroke away.

The left-back is good on the ball and his forays into attack began to drag the Spurs players across the pitch and tire them out. They did not want Shaw on the ball in the slightest.
 Yet, on the other flank, they seemed almost happy for Wan-Bissaka to have all the possession he wanted because they knew he wasn't that dangerous with it.
 At one stage the 22-year-old took a touch, when a dangerous counter attack was unfolding, that was so heavy that it was almost a through-ball to himself. The counter was lost. Another moment saw him get past the left-back but his cross was over-hit with Odion Ighalo in a great position to head home.

Continued lockdowns are infeasible; somebody must produce essential food and services for others.
 So what kind of policy should guide the recovery phase in order to be consistent with beneficence and justice? We believe it is a policy that quickly stabilizes economic freedoms at pre-crisis levels, ruling out future open-ended closures of entire economic sectors. And we believe that two main results will follow from this policy:
 First, it provides the much-needed stabilization of current production and income across all segments of society, along with expectations for stable future employment. It restores to individuals the freedom and ability to control their future economic life.
 Second, it raises the probability that businesses across the board will survive. This addresses an important shortcoming of the initial government response. Raising the probability of survival for all businesses nurtures valuable business and social networks which are fundamental for commercial and financial activity.
 Moreover, it gives individuals and businesses a wide planning horizon. A large body of laboratory evidence indicates that when we mix self-interest with narrow planning horizons, we end up stunting beneficial economic activities in society. A clear and wide time horizon prevents undisciplined cascades of myopic, opportunistic behavior that would negatively reverberate through the entire economy.
 The unwritten rules of cooperation rely on the principles of beneficence and justice. These two principles should guide us through the fog of fear and uncertainty, to help restore economic prosperity.

The Trump campaign is trying to cast Biden as a doddering old man, too forgetful to be president. It’s the same gambit they used on Hillary Clinton, whose “stamina” was called into question by Trump, who — remember? — became a laughingstock when he refused to walk 700 yards for a photo op with other G7 leaders in Sicily, Italy, and had to be transported by golf cart.
 “Geriatric mental health is no laughing matter,” said a pro-Trump Facebook ad, as Trump tries to make Biden’s mental health a laughing matter.
 Here’s the thing: Everybody forgets stuff. Everybody misspeaks now and then.
 But Biden, after eight years as vice president and 36 years in the Senate, could have forgotten half of what he knows and still have a better grip on the world than Trump does.
 I’ll take common decency and empathy over cruelty and narcissism any day. I will take a candidate who believes that black lives matter, that reproductive choice is critical, who wants all Americans to have access to health care and the voting booth and who doesn’t fawn over dictators. I will take transparency over opacity, too.
 Presidents and aspiring presidents have an obligation to let the American people know the state of their health. While Biden has been transparent to a fault, Trump does not believe he even owes the American public the truth about his weight and height.
 We know just about everything there is to know about Biden — his previous history of atrial fibrillation, his gastric reflux issues, his allergies, his 1988 cerebral hemorrhage, his gallbladder removal, his non-melanoma skin cancers. He is 5-feet-11 and weighs 178 pounds, putting his body mass index at a healthy 24.38.
 We know very little about Trump’s physical health, other than that he takes Propecia for hair growth and a statin drug to control his cholesterol and seems to exaggerate his height. (He claims to be 6-foot-3, while his New York driver’s license says he is 6-foot-2.) At his most recently publicized weight of 243 pounds, he is considered obese on body mass index charts.

Shane Patrick McCoy   June 21, 1967 - December 25, 2019   Shane Patrick McCoy was born in McCall, Idaho on June 21, 1967 and passed away on Christmas Day 2019 of heart failure.   Shane spent the first two years of his life in Idaho before moving with his family to Alaska. There he fell in love with hockey and played on a youth league team from first to fifth grade, then later in Boise with an adult team for two years. His passion for the sport flowed over into many aspects of his life and he was an ardent fan of the Pittsburg Penguins. His favorite player was Gordie Howe, a Canadian who played for the Detroit Red Wings, even penning the name "Gordie Howe Trio" as the name of one of the bands he organized in his twenties.   Shane moved back to Idaho in his teens where he found Boise and because of his adventurous nature he made friends easily. He always made a point to keep in close contact with these friends throughout his life. He travelled to Europe in his early twenties with three of his best friends to visit Germany with a side trip to Amsterdam. He also spent time travelling in the Pacific Northwest and Idaho in his Vanagon, taking advantage of Indian summers to camp, hike and hot spring throughout the region.   Shane loved music and had a vast collection of vinyl records that he always managed to have on display almost as an art project. His favorite genre of music was punk rock, however his eclectic nature led to him to include Johnny Cash, Nirvana and The Beatles in his collection. He was a talented musician and was a member of several different punk rock bands, playing guitar and often sang lead. The last band he played with was Haggis and had the honor of playing Tree Fort Music Festival in Boise, Idaho.   Shane was also a talented artist, expressing his feelings in various forms, including intricate pen art called stippling. He has left his family with several cherished pieces of artwork and has passed on these abilities to his two children, Emma and Kyla. As well, he shared his love of tiny houses with them, which became a running joke of how he would fit his record collection in one.   Mostly, though his friends and family knew Shane for his loving and empathetic nature. He felt deeply. He commonly shared these feelings through his art and music, but at times his feelings became overwhelming and his outlet became work where he could isolate himself from the harshness of the world. He worked as a logger in both a family business and later, for another company. He was able to find peaceful moments during these years and always looked for a job opportunity where he could return to the safe harbor of the mountains and trees.   Shane touched many people and was known for taking in and befriending others with similar challenges in life. He was compassionate and became a father figure to a number of young men who tragically had no one else to turn to. He left an indelible impression on so many people.   Memories of Shane were shared at a Celebration of Life gathering back in January and many of his friends and family were able to attend and speak on the nature of their relationship and how he touched their lives. There were many tears and much laughter, as people shared their "Shane" stories, including road trips, bear hugs, humor and his ability to be a consistent presence. We are honoring Shane in our thoughts and will be celebrating what would have been his upcoming 53rd birthday. This happens to fall on Father's Day, his favorite day of the year if you don't count the first day of summer, which often was his birthday as well.   Shane is survived by his dad, Joe McCoy, his mother and her husband, Lenna McCoy and Ken Brocke, his wife, Brandi McCoy and her children, his former wife, Crishawn Stark and their two daughters, Emma and Kyla McCoy, as well as his sister, Jamie Page and niece, Kailey Doan.   "They lived and laughed and loved and left." – James Joyce, Finnegans Wake

Como era de esperarse, fue intenso el debate que entre los expertos generó el documento oficial enviado por el Instituto Nacional de Salud, firmado también por el viceministro de Salud, a la Corte Constitucional y en el que se plantea un escenario de 41.622 muertes por covid-19 de aquí a diciembre, de no modificarse sustancialmente los indicadores que esta tenía el 27 de abril. Tal escenario, aterrador sin duda, motivó críticas de expertos que no están convencidos de algunos de los parámetros utilizados para elaborar tal estimación. Aunque coinciden en que el coronavirus sigue siendo una amenaza seria, plantearon bien fundados interrogantes respecto a tan preocupante cifra.

He currently works for a Colombian contractor with no guarantee of income; the weekly payment is regularly delayed for a week or more. Still, Sanoja continues, taking every job he can get. He works six days a week, at least ten hours a day. "I am grateful to this island and its good people for the work that allows us to have income," he says.

 “We have all the safety measures in place and we’re thrilled to see even this small degree of normality returning to St George’s.
 “St George’s Theatre is a charity and the income from the café is absolutely vital to us, so we’re hoping that the people who would normally come and see our shows will drop by for a morning coffee or afternoon tea to support us while we’re waiting for the theatre to r-open after the Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted.
 “Providing an outdoor table service next month will be the icing on the cake, so let’s hope for some sunny days to give everyone a lift.”

Luke Shaw did an admirable job of doing so in United's 1-1 draw with Tottenham, as they finally returned to action after over three-months away. Spurs had taken a first-half lead and in typical Jose Mourinho fashion, they south to defend the lead rather than press to extend it.
 At some points all of Spurs' players were in their own half, leaving United crowded out and unable to penetrate the defence. Paul Pogba's introduction helped change that and it was the Frenchman's delicious skill that led to the equalising penalty being won. But that came after a period of dominance in which United had begun to turn the screw and they looked so much better when Marcus Rashford was permanently switched over to the left to cut inside so Shaw could exploit the space left behind.

At last, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel of the COVID-19 pandemic in Grand Island for now.
 The number of new cases each week has decreased. Central District Health Director Teresa Anderson told the Independent that last week the district had a 2% positivity rate, which means two of 100 tests were positive.
 “This is a very good sign for us. We were hoping to get below 5% and we have gotten as low as 2% now,” Anderson said.

During his 15 years as a Malawian tobacco farmer, Boniface Namate has had to overcome many difficulties growing the plant that is the country's biggest export earner.
 Namate had banked on a bumper crop this year and had hoped the proceeds would enable him to buy a new car and even build a new house.
 However, the coronavirus pandemic has seen the 56-year-old's dreams go up in smoke.
 Due to restrictions imposed to control the spread of the virus in Malawi -- one of the world's poorest countries, and one of the top 10 tobacco producers -- growers were barred from physically attending the auctions where prices are set.
 That has left farmers feeling cheated by buyers.
 "We are not operating normally as there is no interaction between the buyer and the grower," said Betty Chinyamunyamu of the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi.
 "Because of this, there are trust issues," she said.
 When the auction season opened in April, Namate and other small-scale farmers said their earnings had indeed evaporated.
 "The prices that came from the auction are not what we expected. We are devastated", said Namate.
 Burley leaf from Malawi makes up 6.6 percent of the world's tobacco exports.
 Known locally as "green gold", it is Malawi's top crop in terms of employment.
 It also accounts for over 50 percent of foreign exchange earnings and 23 percent of tax revenues.
 So, when its 50,000 growers suffer, the country has every reason to be worried.
 Last November, the United States restricted tobacco imports from Malawi over allegations of worker exploitation and child labour.
 And the coronavirus has turned up the heat on farmers even more.
 \- In trouble -
 Once he saw the prices being set in the first round of auctions, Namate immediately knew he was in trouble.
 He had been expecting his first bales of 1,116 kilograms to fetch up to $1,500. Instead, he received a meagre $540.
 And out of three tonnes overall from this year's harvest, he had hoped to make around $6,000 in total. But now he says he will be lucky even to make $1,500.
 "I was devastated because I had planned a lot of things with the money," said the farmer from Ntcheu.
 He is even contemplating abandoning the crop altogether.
 "Even my family have threatened to stop helping me in the fields if I insist on tobacco farming," Namate said.
 Another farmer Alick Munthali, who has harvested eight tonnes of tobacco in Rumphi in northern Malawi, finds himself in a similar predicament.
 "We don't know how much the tobacco is fetching and we have no opportunity to negotiate the price with the buyer," said Munthali, who has been farming the crop since 1989.
 "It is difficult to sell your crop when you are not physically present," he said.
 Nevertheless, auctioneers and large-scale growers insist that the farmers are being short-changed by buyers.
 "Farmers are not cheated on the sales," said Felix Thole, chief executive of the Tobacco Association of Malawi Farmer's Trust, which represents large-scale growers.
 He pointed out that growers continue to be represented on the market by farmers' associations.
 "Auction sales bidding continues by the individual buyers, only this time around there is no chanting of the prices. Buyers continue competing and the highest bidder gets the bale," Thole argued.
 Nevertheless, Malawi's main opposition leader Lazarus Chakwera believes farmers have been unfairly treated.
 "The farmers basically have been abused," he told AFP.
 "The government gets a lot of foreign earnings through this particular industry and yet the farmer is treated like a labourer that should not even prosper," he said.

Coronavirus infections in Latin America surged past two million on Saturday, with worst-hit Brazil home to nearly half of the cases as the virus accelerates its spread in the region.
 Europe, which has endured months of lockdowns to slow the virus but at a crippling economic cost, was set to further ease restrictions with Spain reopening to tourists on Sunday and Italy enjoying its first Serie A soccer match in 103 days.
 In the US, which has been taking stuttering steps to reopen even as 20 states have reported a rebound in infections, President Donald Trump Saturday claimed his measures had "saved millions of lives" as he addressed his first rally in months.
 "Now it's time to open up, get back to work," he told the crowd in Tulsa, Oklahoma, even as six members of his advance team tested positive for COVID-19.
 The world's largest economy is taking a beating in a year when Trump seeks re- election.
 Trump had downplayed the risk that the evening rally might trigger a coronavirus outbreak, ignoring danger warnings by Tulsa health and municipal officials.
 After the president had boasted on Twitter that "almost one million people" had requested tickets for the rally, the 20,000-capacity arena was far from full, with many upper deck seats empty.
 The United States remains the country hardest-hit by the pandemic with 119,719 deaths out of 2,254,630 official cases, according to a tally Saturday by Johns Hopkins University.
 With nearly 50,000 deaths and more than one million cases, Brazil is the second worst-affected.
 In total Latin America and the Caribbean have 2,007,621 confirmed cases, according to an AFP tally based on official tallies.
 The figures were particularly alarming in Chile, where the death toll nearly doubled to more than 7,000 under a revised tallying method, and passed 20,000 in Mexico.
 \- Spain reopens to tourists -
 Europe meanwhile chalked up more than 2.5 million cases. Although the spread has slowed, Europe is still the worst-affected continent.
 The continent is easing its way out of strict lockdowns, even as the World Health Organization warns against giving in to isolation fatigue.
 Spain on Sunday reopens its borders to European Union countries in a bid to gets its tourism industry back up and running after lifting its state of emergency.
 British tourists will also be allowed in without having to quarantine, the Spanish foreign minister said.
 As his country emerges from a 14-week lockdown, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that Spain remained vulnerable to the virus, which has claimed more than 28,000 lives there.
 "We must remain on our guard and strictly follow hygiene and protection measures," he warned hours before the borders opened.
 In France, millions more children were preparing to return to school on Monday after three months away.
 "I cried with joy when I got the confirmation from the teacher that my two children would be going back to school full time," said Noemie from the southern city of Nice.
 France is also reopening cinemas from Monday and stadiums for team sports, and in another sign of returning normality, actors have also started kissing again on film shoots.
 A vaccine remains months off at best despite several trials, and scientists are still learning more about the virus, its symptoms and the extent to which it may have spread before being identified.
 "The world is in a new and dangerous phase," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Friday.
 "Many people are understandably fed up with being at home... but the virus is still spreading fast."
 The virus has now killed more than 461,000 people and infected 8.7 million worldwide.
 The Palestinian Authority announced Saturday it was temporarily closing the cities of Hebron and Nablus in the occupied West Bank after a sharp rise in infections.
 Only goods will be allowed in, Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh told journalists. Authorities have reported a total of 687 cases in the West Bank, including two deaths so far.

Shane Patrick McCoy   June 21, 1967 - December 25, 2019   Shane Patrick McCoy was born in McCall, Idaho on June 21, 1967 and passed away on Christmas Day 2019 of heart failure.   Shane spent the first two years of his life in Idaho before moving with his family to Alaska. There he fell in love with hockey and played on a youth league team from first to fifth grade, then later in Boise with an adult team for two years. His passion for the sport flowed over into many aspects of his life and he was an ardent fan of the Pittsburg Penguins. His favorite player was Gordie Howe, a Canadian who played for the Detroit Red Wings, even penning the name "Gordie Howe Trio" as the name of one of the bands he organized in his twenties.   Shane moved back to Idaho in his teens where he found Boise and because of his adventurous nature he made friends easily. He always made a point to keep in close contact with these friends throughout his life. He travelled to Europe in his early twenties with three of his best friends to visit Germany with a side trip to Amsterdam. He also spent time travelling in the Pacific Northwest and Idaho in his Vanagon, taking advantage of Indian summers to camp, hike and hot spring throughout the region.   Shane loved music and had a vast collection of vinyl records that he always managed to have on display almost as an art project. His favorite genre of music was punk rock, however his eclectic nature led to him to include Johnny Cash, Nirvana and The Beatles in his collection. He was a talented musician and was a member of several different punk rock bands, playing guitar and often sang lead. The last band he played with was Haggis and had the honor of playing Tree Fort Music Festival in Boise, Idaho.   Shane was also a talented artist, expressing his feelings in various forms, including intricate pen art called stippling. He has left his family with several cherished pieces of artwork and has passed on these abilities to his two children, Emma and Kyla.
