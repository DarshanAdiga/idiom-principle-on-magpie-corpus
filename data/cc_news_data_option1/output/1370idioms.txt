Oregon’s insurance commissioner for the past two years is the next director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, its parent agency.


  Gov. Kate Brown announced the appointment of Andrew Stolfi on Friday. His appointment is subject to Senate confirmation. His first day was Monday.


  As administrator of the Division of Financial Regulation within the agency — and the state insurance commissioner — he led recent negotiations with insurance companies that resulted in a waiver of cost-sharing with patients in Oregon who require testing for COVID-19.


  He will continue as insurance commissioner.


  In his broader role as agency director, Stolfi will oversee the Building Codes Division, Division of Financial Regulation, the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division, the ombudsman for injured workers, small business ombudsman, Workers’ Compensation Division, Workers’ Compensation Board and the Central Services Division.


  “I believe strongly in our mission of consumer protection,” Stolfi said.


  Brown said in announcing his appointment:


  "He understands the importance of supporting both Oregon’s consumer needs and our business environment during these unprecedented times. His diverse professional background, coupled with a focus on consumer protection, will serve Oregonians well.”


  Stolfi came to Oregon two years ago from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, based in Switzerland. He spent six years there, ending up as chief operating officer and chief counsel. Before then he was at the Illinois Department of Insurance for about three years, ending up as acting director, and also was in the office of legal counsel for the governor.


  He currently serves on the executive committee and as the vice chair of the Health Innovation Working Group and the Consumer Liaison Committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.


  He earned a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1999 from the University of Vermont and his law degree in 2002 from the Chicago-Kent College of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology.


  He succeeds Lou Savage, who has been acting director since Cameron Smith left the job in November. Smith is now deputy secretary of state. Savage will be the acting administrator of Stolfi’s former division in DCBS.

LONDON (AP) — As British Prime Minister Boris Johnson fights the coronavirus in the intensive care unit of a London hospital, the people of his country are wishing him well — and asking who’s in charge. The answer is ambiguous. Britain’s unwritten constitution does not spell out what happens if a prime minister becomes unable to perform his or her job. There is no official role of acting or deputy prime minister, and heads of government only leave office through resignation or death, Alex Thomas, a program director at the Institute for Government, political think-tank, said. “Boris Johnson continues as prime minister for as long as neither of those things happens,” he said. The U.K.'s leaders can appoint someone to fill in for them temporarily during illness or absences. When he was admitted to the hospital Sunday night, Johnson asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab -- who also holds the title first secretary of state -- to take over many of his duties “where appropriate.” The wording has caused some confusion about the limits of Raab’s powers and whether he is authorized to make major policy decisions, or even take the country to war. Johnson’s official spokesman, James Slack, said Tuesday that Raab would lead the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak, and would also be able to lead meetings of the National Security Council, though none is currently scheduled. But Raab can’t fire Cabinet ministers or senior officials, and he won’t hold the prime minister’s weekly audience with Queen Elizabeth II. In the British political system, the prime minister’s power lies less in the role's specific responsibilities — which are relatively few — than in the leader's political capital and authority as “first among equals” in the...

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — The trial of a former NASA astronaut charged in a car crash that killed two girls in 2016 is now scheduled to begin in June. Tuscaloosa County Circuit Judge Allen May issued an order Monday setting James Halsell’s reckless murder trial for June 8. In-person courthouse proceedings are shut down statewide because of the new coronavirus, but May entered a written order without a hearing. Halsell had been set to go on trial in May before the pandemic hit. Halsell, of Huntsville, was arrested after a car crash killed two sisters, 11-year-old Niomi Deona James and 13-year-old Jayla Latrick Parler, nearly four years ago near Tuscaloosa. The girls' father, who was driving a car that was struck by one driven by Halsell, and a woman were injured. Authorities contend Halsell, 63, was under the influence of alcohol. The defense blames the wreck on sleeping medication. Halsell, who is free on bond, flew five shuttle missions before retiring from NASA in 2006 with more than 1,200 hours in space.

Connally coach Ryan Ford is a fan of his team's creativity and desire to play quality soccer.


   


  But even he thinks the Cougars over-complicate things at times.


   


  "Sometimes I just want them to go past the guy," Ford said with a laugh.


   


  Joking aside, the unselfish style of play Connally employed this year led to tremendous results, as the Cougars went undefeated through District 17-5A to claim the district championship.


   


  "We're good technically with the ball," Ford said. "Our guys try to keep it on the ground; (they) want to use each other, play as a team and break the opponent down that way. They all want everybody to be successful. No one is a glory-hound or wants to be successful for themselves. It's all about the team."


   


  Connally (13-2-7, 7-0-5 District 17-5A) has developed into a perennially strong program in Ford's eight-year tenure at the school in North Austin and the Pflugerville school district. The Cougars went to the state tournament in 2016 and have made several deep playoff runs. The Cougars have made the playoffs in each of Ford's years as head coach and have only missed the postseason once since the program began in 1998.


   


  The seeds for this season's success were planted late last year, when the Cougars finished district play strong to slip into the playoffs then advanced to the regional quarterfinals.


   


  "We really started to put it together in the playoffs (in 2019)," Ford said. "Those guys worked hard and learned last year, so we really hit the ground running this year. A really good chunk of that was starting the year with 17 seniors. We had good scrimmages, and everybody knew what was expected of them."


   


  Connally went 6-2-2 in non-district play, then started district play with four straight wins to take the early lead in the district title race. Cougars senior captain Jesus Luna noted that the players having so much familiarity with each other helped the team to success.


   


  "The way last year ended and this season started, I realized it was going to be something special," he said. "We know each other's playing style. Most of us have played together since the eighth grade, and we know what to do and when to do it. We like to possess and pass the ball, and that's how we generate our attack opportunities."


   


  The Cougars scored the most goals in the district with 27, but their defense was what led the way as they only allowed 10 goals in 12 matches. Ford noted that senior goalkeeper Andrew Steele saved two penalties during a 3-1 win over Rouse in the second match of district play to propel the defense to a strong year. Connally posted three straight shutouts to end the season.


   


  "It didn't matter how we lined up, we always had seniors in the back and a senior goalkeeper," Ford said. "Our defense was fantastic."


   


  Along the way, the Cougars swept rival Pflugerville -- something Luna noted he was especially proud of -- and clinched the district title before the coronavirus canceled the final district match. Winning the district was crucially important for the seniors, Luna said.


   


  "The amount of work we had to put in to go undefeated was massive," he said. "So being able to win it means a lot to all of us."


   


  Connally may not get a shot at another playoff run with the coronavirus keeping the playoffs in limbo. Even without a playoff game, the Cougars can take pride in their style of play leading it to an impressive feat.


   


  "District titles don't come along very often, so we're really excited about that," Ford said. "And the undefeated aspect was great. I've never done that before at Connally, and I know how hard it is to get through a district like ours."

Es wäre also darum gegangen, relativ rasch die Immunität der berühmten 60 bis 70% der Bevölkerung zu erreichen. Dieser Kurs wurde viel kritisiert, und so machte der Premier eine Kehrtwendung und führte Eindämmungsmaßnahmen ein, die den deutschen nicht in Strenge nachstehen. Beide Länder gehen damit einen Mittelweg zwischen den stärkeren Ausgangssperren des europäischen Südens und dem liberalen Modell, dem man in Schweden oder abgeschwächt in Dänemark aufgrund der Staatstreue der Skandinavier noch folgen kann.

Tandem piston compressor delivers gasses at very high pressure, which is a positive- displacement compressor with piston driven by crankshaft. Gas or oil enters from inlet channel and enters to suction manifold, further gas is compressed by reciprocating action of piston and gas gets discharged from outlet and enters from inlet. Piston compressor is used in various applications of oil refineries, gas pipelines, natural gas and refrigeration plants. By using tandem piston compressor energy consumption can be reduced to 20 % as compared to normal piston. Life of tandem piston compressor is 10 times longer than as compared to normal compressor with minimal maintenance problems. Ionic liquid and many seals are attached with normal compressor and removed in tandem piston compressor to improve quality and performance of operation.

US President Donald Trump attacked the World Health Organization on Tuesday, saying it is "China centric" and issued bad advice at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look," he tweeted.
 Trump went on to ask why the WHO had given "such a faulty recommendation," apparently referring to the UN body's recommendation against curtailing international travel to stop the virus which first spread from China.
 "Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on," Trump wrote, referring to his decision to ban travel from the country.
 China is under fire in Washington, particularly from Republicans, over the way it handled the pandemic and Trump has expressed doubt over the accuracy of Chinese statistics for cases and deaths.
 However, Trump himself has been widely criticized for initially downplaying the virus, which he likened to an ordinary flu and said was under control in the United States, before later accepting that it was a national emergency.
 More than 11,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19.

Dr. Joseph Frederick Ralston, Jr.      Fayetteville, TN - Dr. Joseph Frederick Ralston, Jr., 65, of Fayetteville, TN, passed away at home on April 1. He was born on April 25, 1954 in Fayetteville to Fred and Clara Ralston. From a young age Fred was busy and engaged delivering newspapers on his bicycle. Later, during high school years, at the Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, he started a business for the filling and delivery of magazine subscriptions and had a summer internship in the US Senate. After graduating from Andover, he moved on to receive a B.A. in political science from Yale University. During these years he co-chaired the Yale Political Union, a debate society and central forum for political discussion and activism at Yale. In the middle of his senior year, having fulfilled all requirements, he returned home to Fayetteville when his father passed away. He chose to assist his mother with the family-owned funeral chapel rather than staying in New Haven for one last semester of revelry. His dedication to family and sense of duty was strong. As a young man, Fred had worked with his father, a former US Navy Corpsman, and had accompanied him on ambulance calls.      In 1980 Dr. Ralston received his M.D. from the University of Tennessee College of Medicine and began a three-year residency in Internal Medicine at Baptist Hospital in Memphis. Following his residency he returned to his hometown, where he worked at Fayetteville Medical Associates for thirty-seven years until his death. He loved the long-term relationships he had with patients, for whom he advocated in his many roles in professional organizations.      He was Master, American College of Physicians; Chair, Board of Governors, ACP; and President Emeritus, ACP, the largest medical-specialty organization and second-largest physician group in the United States. He also served in several Tennessee Medical Association leadership roles, including board chairman. He served on the Board of Elders at First Presbyterian Church. He was especially talented with parliamentary procedure. He was one of twenty-five Master Physicians from across the United States to be inducted into The Royal College of Physicians, London. He was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, an Honorary Fellow of the Indian College of Physicians and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Closer to home, he received the Laureate Award as Outstanding Internist from the Tennessee Chapter of ACP.      Dr. Ralston's multi-tasking talents enabled him to eat lunch while juggling conference calls and media interviews. His workday never ended. It was common for him to work on patient charts and medically-related responsibilities for several hours at the end of the day. He read medical journals between heats at his sons' swim meets. He never wasted time having a tidy study.      The talented nurses, staff, and partners at Fayetteville Medical Associates created a community that was especially meaningful for Dr. Ralston. He was also nurtured by friends at First Presbyterian Church, TMA, ACP, and especially by longtime friend Ray Fraley, with whom he shared a love of books, history, and sports.      Dr. Ralston was a devoted father to his twin sons, now year-three medical students and aspiring internal medicine doctors at his alma mater. His pride in and love for them was boundless. They shared a love of baseball, and he treated them to Braves games on many of their birthdays. When ACP duties required that he travel far and wide, his children were able to come along. These travels with him are among their best memories. He is survived by his children, James David Ralston of Memphis, Willis Farris Ralston of Memphis; his sister Susan Ralston McLean of Rainier, WA; his brother-in-law Arthur McLean of Dallas; his nephew Alexander McLean of Dallas; twelve first cousins; his partner Michele Matthews and her son Cade.      In his maternal line he was predeceased by his mother, Clara Belle Robertson Wolfhard of Fayetteville; his grandparents, James Herbert and Lilla Belle Young Robertson of Winston Salem, NC; his uncles, Winfred Robertson, Edwin Robertson and James Robertson, all of NC; and his aunt, Elizabeth Stamper, also of NC. In his paternal line he was predeceased by his father Joseph Frederick Ralston of Fayetteville; his grandparents, James David and Jessie Jones Ralston of Fayetteville; and his aunt, Josephine Ralston Binns (aka Penn) of Nashville. He was also predeceased by his sister Clare Chapman Ralston of Frankewing, TN and his 'adopted brother' Howell Lynch of New Orleans.      Due to the current health climate the visitation, burial, and celebration of his life will be held at a later date, to be determined. The family invites you to share memories at higginsfh.com.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The Florida sheriff's office ripped apart by the 2018 Parkland high school massacre is now facing an angry, public fracture sparked by the coronavirus death of one of its deputies. The animosity between Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony and the union representing his street deputies got even nastier on Tuesday when union president Jeff Bell penned a column blasting Tony in the local newspaper, the South Florida Sun Sentinel. It came four days after the death of Deputy Shannon Bennett, 39, and after three dozen Broward deputies and other employees had tested positive for COVID-19. Bell accused the sheriff of not providing his deputies with sufficient protective equipment as they face a disease ”that has the potential to take more lives of police officers in a single month than will fall to gunfire nationwide in a year.\" “Tony has been politically fiddling with facts like Nero as Rome burned,” wrote Bell, the leader of the 1,400-member Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association. “This so-called BSO savior, the man who rode into office with the support of distraught Parkland parents and this union, has failed to provide leadership.” Tony quickly returned fire, calling a Tuesday morning news conference at which he excoriated Bell, saying he used Bennett's death “to politicize and capitalize on a moment when we lost one of our own.” He called Bell's actions “dishonorable.\" “For any rogue employee to come off and make these comments and say we have failed this community and the men and women we are leading is despicable,” Tony said. He said the department has issued more than 25,000 N95 masks, 45,000 surgical masks and 4,000 bottles of hand sanitizer to its deputies and others. “We do not have time to play games with politics, as we are in a major crisis in this...

_Married at First Sight_ 's Derek Sherman and Katie Conrad don't exactly seem to be on the same page heading into Decision Day. After their time on the couples retreat ended in a screaming match during last week's episode of the Lifetime reality show (produced by Kinetic Content), the married couple has just one week before they make a decision about their future. That decision seems to be a bit more up in the air for Katie than for Derek, however, as shown in a tense PopCulture.com exclusive clip.
 Sitting down for a romantic glass of wine by the water, Katie explains the setting makes her want to "get married again." But when Derek brings up having a second wedding after Decision Day, she admits she's "not sure yet." Derek then brings up the "little bit of a rough patch" they had during their retreat, but Katie tells him she feels like things have been rough "for the past couple of weeks."
 "I think that we were avoiding confrontation," she continues. "We were arguing, but I don't feel like we were really getting to the root of things. I feel like this weekend, we were able to hash a lot out. So I feel a little bit better about where we're at going into Decision Day."
 Derek tells her he's feeling "a little nervous," but feeling good about the big day, at which point Katie fires back snarkily, "What are you nervous about? Do you think I'm gonna say yes on Decision Day?" When Derek admits he's "hoping" his wife will agree to continue their marriage, she responds, "Guess you'll find out."

 Derek and Katie's fighting reached a head during last week's episode, when Katie accused Derek of flirting with co-star Taylor Dunklin. "I've seen you at this point initiate conversation with girls, and you don't act like a loser or a weirdo with everyone else," Katie told Derek, who replied he was just being himself before she shouted, "I'm so f--ing done!"
 Will Katie and Derek be able to keep their marriage afloat for Decision Day? Or are they ready for their marriage to come to a close? _Married at First Sight_ (produced by Kinetic Content) airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana is releasing more information about its coronavirus deaths, showing the virus's victims are disproportionately black and two-thirds of those who have died suffered from high blood pressure. The new data released by Louisiana's health department, which will be updated weekly, gives a glimpse of who is most at risk of dying from the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus in a state deemed one of the nation's most unhealthy. Although African Americans account for one-third of Louisiana’s population, they represent more than 70% of the state’s deaths from COVID-19 caused by the virus, according to the data. Gov. John Bel Edwards called that racial disparity disturbing. “That deserves more attention. We're going to have to dig into that and see what we can do to slow that trend down,” the Democratic governor said. Dr. Alexander Billioux, assistant secretary of Louisiana’s Office of Public Health, said the disproportionate rate of deaths in the black community is tied to the state’s existing health gap between African Americans and white residents. “If you go from a situation as a state where you have significant health disparities and you put something like this on top of it, it’s sad, but it doesn’t surprise me that unfortunately we’re seeing that community be so dramatically affected,” Billioux said. More than 16,000 people in Louisiana are confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, about 12% of whom are hospitalized, according to health department data. The death toll climbed higher Tuesday to 582 people, with 70 new deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the largest single-day increase. Hypertension is the leading underlying health condition for those who have died from COVID-19 in Louisiana, with more than 66% of...
