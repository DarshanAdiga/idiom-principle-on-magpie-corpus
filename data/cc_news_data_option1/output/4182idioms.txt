With all these warning signs, other news organizations, including NPR, have held back. Reporters who shared the _New York Post_ story on social media found themselves denounced by Democrats and even many of their peers. Twitter blocked and Facebook restricted the spread of the story, rare moves that gave conservatives a chance for outrage regardless of the merits of the reporting. The social media giants soon found themselves on the defensive.


  All of which obscured the problems with the New York Post's story itself, and those that followed.


  So here are some quick highlights:


  From pillar to post, the tabloid asserted as fact things presumed to be true. While the headline links the former vice president to his son's business dealings, the story serves up no proof. It rests upon an email, supposedly from an Ukrainian businessman to the younger Biden, thanking him for "an opportunity to meet your father."


  Biden's campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, responded, "We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the _New York Post_ , ever took place." There is some wiggle room in that denial. But that's not proof, either. The _New York Post_ nonetheless asserted, breathlessly, and assuredly, that there was a "never-before-revealed meeting."

INDIANAPOLIS — Colts coach Frank Reich has made his preference perfectly clear — he intends to run first.


  A year ago, Reich’s philosophy worked just fine behind one of the league’s top offensive lines.


  This year, though, defenses have increasingly stacked the line of scrimmage, played tighter coverages on short routes and dared Philip Rivers to beat them over the top.


  It has taken a toll. Indianapolis has slid from seventh in the league rankings in 2019 to 23rd, a number Reich and his players know must change starting Sunday against Cincinnati.


  “That’s a challenge we embrace and if you want to be the best, you have to be able to handle that,” Reich said. “I think we will continue to make progress. I feel good about the guys we’ve got and the direction we’re going.”


  There’s little doubt the Colts (3-2) can churn out victories, even without 1,000-yard rusher Marlon Mack who suffered a season-ending Achilles tendon injury in the season opener. The combination of rookie Jonathan Taylor, Mack’s replacement, and Nyheim Hines has provided a solid one-two punch out of the backfield.


  Taylor is one of three rookies with a 100-yard game this season and only three players in franchise history posted more yards from scrimmage in their first five games than the former Wisconsin star, who has 414. While Hines has done more work in the passing game, he has been effective on the ground, too.


  Still, the Colts rank 31st in yards per carry at 3.55, something they could turn around against a Bengals defense allowing 102.6 yards per game and will be playing with a depleted front four after putting two more defensive linemen on injured reserve this week.


  Cincinnati (1-3-1) insists it will be up to the challenge.


  “I know what’s ahead of us, I know what’s ahead of this team, I know what’s ahead of this defense,” defensive tackle Christian Covington said. “We just have to be able to learn from our mistakes and get back into it because we know who we have up against when it comes to Indianapolis this week.”


  LINE DANCE


  The Bengals finally got defensive tackle Geno Atkins back in the lineup last week.


  The problem: more injuries. Defensive tackle D.J. Reader and defensive end Sam Hubbard both went on injured reserve this week. Reader, who signed a four- year, $53 million free-agent deal, suffered a season-ending quad injury in the loss to Baltimore. Hubbard injured his elbow.


  Cincinnati already was missing injured defensive tackles Mike Daniels and Renell Wren as well as Josh Tupou, who opted out of the season so they have signed free agent defensive tackle Xavier Williams.


  Atkins may see more snaps this week than the 19 he logged last week, but he’s likely to still be on a pitch count.


  “We’ll be smart,” coach Zac Taylor said. “I think he got the right amount of snaps coming off the time he spent off. We’ll just continue to re-evaluate that every week and see where he’s a potential fit.”


  YOUTH VS. EXPERIENCE


  Sunday’s game pits a 37-year-old coach in Taylor, against a 38-year-old quarterback in Philip Rivers.


  It’s not the first time they’ve been on opposite sidelines. Rivers, a four- year starter at North Carolina State, won his first three games against Wake Forest then lost to the Demon Deacons in 2003 when Taylor, then a freshman, was a backup quarterback.


  Taylor eventually finished his career at Nebraska.


  As for this week, Taylor knows what to expect.


  “Maybe he doesn’t move as well as he did in 2002 when he was beating up on Wake and I was sitting there on the bench, but he’s still dangerous and capable,” Taylor said. “I’ve always had such high respect for him. I feel like I’ve watched every game he’s played in for 20 years. I guess that has an effect on you.”


  GREEN’S ROLE


  The Bengals would like to get receiver A.J. Green more involved this week after another rocky start.


  The 32-year-old, seven-time Pro Bowler has been overshadowed by the younger Tyler Boyd, who has emerged as Burrow’s favorite target.


  Through five games, Green has 14 receptions, 119 yards and no touchdowns though Burrow missed him twice on potential scoring plays. Green’s longest gain this season has been 15 yards. And after missing 23 games the previous two seasons and an early departure last week after aggravating a sore hamstring, some are speculating he could be traded before the league’s Nov. 3 deadline.

Tarn Taran Sahib (Punjab) [India], October 17 (ANI): Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu who fought terrorism in Punjab was shot dead by two unknown assailants in Tarn Taran district on Friday, family members who initially resisted to cremate the body, agreed to perform last rites on Saturday following an assurance from local administration that the culprits will be nabbed as soon as possible.   Sandhu's wife Jagdish Kaur was adamant that the family will not perform the last rites until the culprits were arrested and also accused the government of withdrawing his security cover.   "There are 42 registered FIRs of attacks on our family and countless other attacks have taken place which is not on record. Withdrawal of security was wrong," Jagdish Kaur, wife of Shaurya Chakra-awardee Balwinder Singh said on Saturday.  
 "Government, administration and intelligence agencies are responsible for this. We sought security again, but to no avail. Those who treat security cover as a status symbol have been provided with it. We actually needed it but weren't provided," she added.   Rajesh Sharma, Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM), informed the media, "After the administration's assurance, the family has now agreed to conduct the last rites of Balwinder Singh. Additionally, three security personnel have also been deployed for the family's security."   "Further, according to the demand of the family, a member of Balwinder Singh's family has been assured a government job and I have conveyed the same to the state government," Sharma added.   "The culprit behind Balwinder Singh's death shall be put behind bars in no time. We're investigating the matter," Jagjit Singh Walia, Superintendent of Police (SP), said on Saturday.   "No matter who they are, the police will surely catch the perpetrators," Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill said. CCTV investigation in the matter is underway. (ANI)

 Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi’s wedding was one of the most low- key royal events ever celebrated within the gates of Buckingham Palace yet it ended up inching its way into history, all due to the princess’s wedding gown choice.

COLUMBUS — Ohio State came within one botched play of likely advancing to the national championship game last season. Getting that close — and the fervent belief they have the weapons to get there in 2020 — motivated the Buckeyes through the long, unpredictable offseason.


  Coach Ryan Day was convinced this year’s team could win the national title, especially with Heisman Trophy finalist Justin Fields returning at quarterback. The second-year coach was so distraught during the month or so that the Big Ten put the season on the shelf that he barely slept.


  No. 6 Ohio State is loaded again for sure. Besides Fields, the Buckeyes return an offensive line stocked with NFL prospects, last year’s top receiver, Chris Olave, and a veteran defense that includes All-American cornerback Shaun Wade.


  “We have all the weapons we need to be putting up crazy numbers and winning games by as much as we want to,” said Jake Hausmann, one of three returning tight ends who combined for seven touchdown catches last season.


  Ohio State surely will miss 2,000-yard rusher J.K. Dobbins and defensive end Chase Young — also a Heisman finalist — but as usual there are some guys waiting who might turn out to be just as good.


  After the Big Ten postponed the season Aug. 11. Wade, the star cornerback, and offensive lineman Wyatt Davis opted out to prepare for the NFL draft. Both decided to come back to the team within days of the conference reinstating the season on Sept. 16. Both said they saw the potential for a national championship and didn’t want to pass it up.


  Ohio State opens its eight-game regular season Oct. 24 at home against Nebraska.


  “I think they’re going to be better than they were last year,” ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit said. “I think they’re a forgotten brand now for obvious reasons. I think when they hit the ground running, people will be reminded how good they are.”


  HEISMAN HOPEFUL AGAIN


  Expectations are lofty for Fields after a stellar 2019 season and his trip to New York for the Heisman ceremony.


  After transferring from Georgia after the 2018 season, he completed 67% of his passes for 3,273 yards, 41 touchdowns and just three interceptions last year for the Buckeyes. His cool demeanor and ability to extend plays are well known, but his teammates say he is even more confident and vocal now in his role as a leader.


  Fields, who likely would have been a first-rounder in the spring even if he had not played this season, is another with his eye on the great potential of the 2020 team.


  “I don’t think there are words to describe how determined I am,” he said.


  BACKFIELD IN MOTION


  Runners like Dobbins don’t come along all the time. He rushed for 4,459 yards in three years, second most all-time in school history behind two-time Heisman winner Archie Griffin.


  His numbers could have been higher last year, but he often sat in the second half after the Buckeyes had piled on the points. That enabled backup Master Teague III to get big chunks of playing time and log 789 rushing yards.


  Teague, who had to rehab from an Achilles tendon injury suffered on the first day of spring practice in March, now is healthy and will be the presumptive starter. He could split carries with Trey Sermon, an Oklahoma transfer, with others contributing.


  VIRUS UPDATE


  Ohio State does not release numbers or information on players or staff who test positive for the coronavirus, so it’s hard to tell what the situation is inside the program. The program is testing 120 players and 50 staff members daily. The athletic department reported it is spending $3.5 million on testing.


  SCHEDULE SCRAMBLE


  Ohio State’s first three nonconference games were lost when the Big Ten limited the schedule to conference games only. After the opener against Nebraska, the Buckeyes will get a likely Top 10 matchup with No. 9 Penn State on Halloween. The rest might be a romp until they get to No. 19 Michigan on Dec. 12 in Columbus. It’ll be the first time since 2010 the Ohio State- Michigan game will not be played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and the first time in the 127-year history of the rivalry that it’s ever been played in December.

By Baidurjo Bhose   Dubai [UAE], October 17 (ANI): Krunal Pandya's role in the Mumbai Indians unit is similar to that of a goalkeeper. While he is an integral part of the set- up, he isn't the most talked about player in the unit. Not only is he expected to hit those quick-fire runs at the end of the innings, he is also Rohit Sharma's go-to-man when the team needs quick wickets.   While Krunal hasn't really had too many opportunities with the bat apart from that 4-ball 20 that he hit against Sunrisers Hyderabad in this edition of the Indian Premier League, the all-rounder isn't perturbed. He believes his job is to fit into the role that the management gives him.   "Yeah, I am playing this role for the last four-five overs. This year also I am happy with the way I have been going about with my batting and bowling. This year we have been doing really well and the top-order has done well so I haven't really batted, but the little I have, I have tried to create an impact.  
 "Bowling wise also, I have tried to do well. I have bowled those crucial overs and I am happy how I have gone about it. And yes, like you said, it is a thankless job, but I love those tough situations and I wait for those as a player. You know, go out their and bail your team out from those tough situations and win games for the team," he told ANI during an interaction with select media.   While Krunal has been good with the impactful knocks or picking the crucial wickets, an India comeback is also very much at the back of his mind. But the all-rounder makes it clear that the team comes first.   "I also want to comeback into the Indian team. If you see the games I have played for India, I have done well in terms of the bowling I did. I got Man of the Match awards. Overall I was happy with the journey with the Indian team. I am looking forward to making a comeback.   "At the end of the day, I have never thought about it as an individual. I have always believed in keeping the team first, be it for India, Mumbai Indians or Baroda. Sometimes, if the required run-rate is 15 and you bowl a 6-run over, that is as good as a four-wicket haul.   "Again, that 4-ball 20 against SRH created an impact and brought the momentum back for us. I never think about those big runs or picking wickets. It is about what is important for the team," he explained. (ANI)

Kunal Nayyar touches on Big Bang Theory’s original plot for Rajesh Koothrappali
 Despite the fact that _Big Bang Theory_ has been off the air for nearly a year now, its most stereotypically accurate character, Rajesh Koothrappali, played by Kunal Nayyar has come forward with some interesting titbits regarding the initial plot draw up of the character and his life.
 During his interview with _Metro UK,_ Kunal was quoted saying, “When they were rounding out the cast of Big Bang when I was auditioning, at that time the character was called Dave, and he was supposed to be a first-generation American… but I came and I brought my big New Delhi self to it!”
 He went on to say, “I was auditioning against Koreans, Japanese, Pakistanis, Chinese… they were really trying to fill out the diverse characters into this show. ‘It wasn’t particularly “oh here we want an Indian scientist”. I got very lucky and it happened to fall into my hands.”
 Kunal concluded by saying, “They allowed me to really be an Indian, who has Indian qualities who doesn’t always run away from them, but also does run away from some of them. That’s just what all of us do. All of us have cultural appropriations that are attached to us, that sometimes we run away from, and then sometimes unbeknown to us, we fall into, and I think they found a really nice balance with Raj.”
 "So that’s why you see a lot of Indians in roles and in roles on television, but also in roles in life in those positions. I’ve always said if a stereotype is to be smart, I’m happy to take it!"
