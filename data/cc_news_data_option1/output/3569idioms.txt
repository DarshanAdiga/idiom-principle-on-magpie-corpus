Such a system seems to be overly cautious on paper but there was little about the free-flowing build-up to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s goal in the latter game that reflected that on the pitch.
 When such a system has the fluidity to allow the Gunners to shut up shop against the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool whilst also bringing football that is altogether more easy on the eye when Arteta’s side cut loose why should there be such a rush to declare it null and void?
 Certainly in the transition between defence and attack it has been hugely effective and undoubtedly intriguing. Indeed so versatile is his approach to systems that it almost feels null to perceive of Arteta’s Arsenal as having one set shape.
 In defence they may well drop to a three man system with wing-backs patrolling ahead but in attack the Gunners move forward rather like a team with a bank of four would. At their most confident Arsenal can operate with something not dissimilar to a 3-3-4 or 2-3-5, pushing one wing-back extremely high up the pitch whilst the other drops into midfield.

Jason Momoa's support here is a potentially powerful statement. While _Justice League_ as a production was something of a flop, Momoa's solo _Aquaman_ movie was a massive hit. A sequel has already been given the green light, which means that Momoa's relationship with DC, and by extension Warner Bros., is ongoing, and important to both sides. Fisher has been the only one speaking out about whatever it was that happened on the set of _Justice League_ , and Momoa could easily stay out of this as most everybody else has done. Though, to be fair, staying quiet on issues isn't exactly Jason Momoa's style.

Trybunał Sprawiedliwości Unii Europejskiej ma odpowiedzieć na pytania zadane mu przez szwedzki sąd, przed którym toczy się niecodzienny proces. Jest on odpryskiem innego sporu pomiędzy dwiema osobami, które prowadzą strony internetowe. Jedna z nich jako dowód przesłała sądowi kopię strony internetowej, na której widniało zdjęcie. Przeciwnik procesowy uznał to za naruszenie jego praw autorskich do tej fotografii i wytoczył osobny proces. Sąd pierwszej instancji uznał, że rzeczywiście doszło do rozpowszechnienia cudzego utworu. Zgodnie bowiem ze szwedzkim prawem każdy może zażądać dostępu do akt sprawy sądowej, a tym samym każdy może mieć dostęp do fotografii. Jednocześnie jednak sąd oddalił pozew, stwierdzając, że autor nie wykazał poniesienia szkody. Skład orzekający w drugiej instancji nabrał wątpliwości i postanowił przedstawić kilka szczegółowych pytań TSUE. Zmierzają one do ustalenia, czy przesłanie sądowi utworu może stanowić jego publiczne udostępnianie bądź publiczne rozpowszechnianie.

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's tax revenues aren't as dire as Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy estimated, legislative calculations published on Tuesday show. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services projects about $37.8 billion in revenue through June 2021. That's nearly $1.4 billion higher than what the governor laid out in his budget address last month. The difference is significant because it could mean lawmakers and Murphy won't have as much of a budget gap to close. The biggest difference between the legislative estimates and Murphy’s are in the income tax. The Legislature’s estimate foresees about $880 million more than what Murphy’s administration projected. Murphy's proposal estimates a nearly $5 billion hole, which he wants to fill with $4 billion in borrowing and nearly a $1 billion in higher taxes on millionaires, yachts and certain businesses. He's also put forward nearly $1 billion in cuts and savings, though those fall short of the belt- tightening some fiscal hawks want. The estimates come as the Democrat-led Legislature begins considering Murphy's proposal in committee hearings on Tuesday. Lawmakers have until Sept. 30 to get a budget to Murphy's desk. The fiscal year typically ends June 30, but it was extended this year by three months because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Fiscal 2021 will run from Oct. 1 through June 30. The state constitution requires a balanced budget be enacted. Although legislative analysts publish their own revenue estimates every year, it's the governor alone who has the constitutional authority to certify revenues. That means his figures will carry the day. Murphy has said the virus has hit lower-income residents particularly hard, making him reluctant to cut services when people might need them most. Republicans have...

The £39-per-month Peloton app includes lots of other fitness classes and programmes, each featuring the same high-quality production values and upbeat motivational tropes. While you’ve always been able to cast the videos to your TV or prop up your phone near the yoga mat, they were difficult to do properly using the bike’s display. It wasn’t seamless and felt clunky – and therefore easily ignored – but by simply rotating the screen to a position that suits the space you’re in, you have access to a whole suite of fitness classes. And no more excuses.


  ## More than just spin


  Cardio-focused spin sessions are addictive, pump you full of endorphins and burn calories, but all-round fitness, whatever your age or condition, needs a mix of activities, and with the Bike+ it’s now much easier to try something other than spinning. Psychologically, being able to do more with the bike, and not having to use your phone and faff about with screen casting, somehow makes the high price of the subscription feel better value.


  Our review bike came supplied with various weights and a workout mat (both sold separately, £TBC) that has one side for yoga and one reinforced rubber side for weights. The tough side has been designed to withstand dropped weights, sweat and cycling cleats to coincide with a new Bike Bootcamp class (from September 15) that combines spin cardio and floor work. It’s not a unique idea – the Nordictrack S22i Studio Cycle iFit does this already – but the pre-release workout we tried was well executed and suitably demanding on and off the bike.

It saw her speaking to a female soldier about working in a male-dominated industry.The same day saw her posting a tribute to John Hume, a Nobel peace prize winner who helped bring an end to the Troubles after his passing on August 3.Defending herself from claims of hypocrisy, Whitmore said at the time that she had only been asked to be a guest on a Podcast talking about body issues and being a female in a male dominated industry.&quot;The other guest was a young female soldier. If this looked like me trying to recruit people to the army, that is not the case at all,&rdquo; she said.However, a report in today&rsquo;s The Times Irish edition said the podcast was produced in conjunction with Capita, a consulting, digital services and software business.Figures in the same report state that the total cost of producing the three episodes was €126,631 including €51,719 for &lsquo;talent.&rsquo; Former Premier League footballer Jermaine Jenas and Chessie King also took part.The British Army, Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have all worked with Capita for the past eight years. Capita&rsquo;s website states that the purpose of the partnership is &ldquo;single minded&rdquo; and that is &ldquo;to recruit tomorrow&rsquo;s army today&rdquo;.Details released under a Freedom of Information (FOI) request states that the Podcast&rsquo;s goal is to entice new recruits into the military.&ldquo;The recruiting partnering project (RPP) is a partnering agreement between the British Army and Capita since 2012. Capita works hand- in-hand with the army to attract, source and select officers and soldiers (regular and reserve), to the quantity and quality that the British Army needs each year,&rdquo; it says.&ldquo;The Locker Podcasts are part of the RPP&rsquo;s overall marketing strategy to attract applications by using a wide range of opportunities and media channels.&rdquo;A spokesperson for the British Army said that all influencers were briefed on the background of the campaign, according to the report. They were all made aware that the Podcast was &ldquo;a continuation of the army recruitment campaign&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it was an activity promoting army jobs&rdquo;.In a lengthy statement today, Whitmore said she had been asked to speak about being a women in a male-dominated industry like the media world.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with the history of the British Army or the atrocities they have inflicted.

The Atlanta Braves' season-long rotation woes continued Tuesday when Max Fried, the top healthy starter, was placed on the 10-day injured list. The latest blow to the rotation could accelerate the team's plans to have Cole Hamels rushed into action for his 2020 debut. Fried had been the only current healthy member of the projected rotation before the season began. Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos said Fried has a left-side muscle spasm in his lumbar spine. Anthopoulos said he hopes Fried can return from the IL as soon as he is eligible on Sept. 16. Fried said his velocity “was definitely down” after he allowed three runs in five innings against the Washington Nationals on Saturday night. He is 6-0 with a 1.98 ERA after not taking a decision in the 10-4 loss. Before the injury, Fried excelled as the team's top starter, filling the void left when the Braves lost opening day starter Mike Soroka to a torn right Achilles tendon suffered on Aug. 3 against the New York Mets. Soroka's season-ending injury was only the most notable of a staggering series of setbacks that have rocked the rotation. Former ace Mike Foltynewicz was designated for assignment and then assigned to the team's alternate training site after he was not signed by another club. The move came after the right-hander gave up three home runs, four walks and six runs in his 2020 debut, a 14-5 loss at Tampa Bay. Hamels, the left-hander signed to add needed experience to the rotation, has not pitched this season after having a sore shoulder in spring training and then developing triceps tendinitis. Hamels threw his first live batting practice after Sunday's game. Another veteran, Félix Hernández, opted out of the 2020 season after it appeared he might win the No. 5 spot in the rotation.

The experiences I have shared about playing _7 Fortunes_ are some of the reasons I really enjoyed playing this game and want to play it again and again. The game is well balanced.

The fact that the game's designer included strategy cards for each champion illustrates that players are encouraged to try different tactics and learn to play as each of the Champions. I love the fact that there are 35 unique champions. Right there, you could play the game at least 35 times and have a different experience each time. Add in the fact that you are playing against different Champions and that adds to even more replayability. As you can see in some of the images in this article, the artwork is incredible.

Her feelings have changed now that she sees the pages being run like a business by Ahmaud's homie Akeem Baker. To make matters worse, she doesn't even have access to the page to edit or change things.

Once it becomes possible for data companies to collect the consent to port data just before its transfer, we will be able to unbundle consent into that which is required for signing up to a service and that which needs to be obtained in order to port the data to a third party.

Average gasoline prices fell last week in New York state in the nation after a brief uptick in the wake of Hurricane Laura, but increases persisted in Mid- Hudson Valley counties, according to GasBuddy.com.
 Local averages Tuesday morning, according to GasBuddy, were $2.23 per gallon in Ulster County, up a penny from a week earlier; $2.29 in Dutchess County, up 2 cents; and $2.38 in Greene County, also up 2 cents.
 The New York state average Tuesday morning was $2.29 per gallon, down a penny, GasBuddy reported. The national average fell 2.8 cents per gallon, to $2.21.
 "Gas prices [nationwide] have started to fall, as expected, as oil prices have fallen slightly since Hurricane Laura moved on and as seasonal challenges come to into view," said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. "We'll likely see additional downward movement in the weeks ahead with gasoline demand set to decline as we move into the fall months and as COVID-19 restrictions keep demand from rallying.

Larry Curtin is Principal. “As with the last number of years we got excellent results, quite a number in the high 500s and one with a perfect score of 625, an outstanding achievement. It's a credit to the hard work by students, but we moved quickly in March and had online video classes from 9am Monday to 4pm Friday. Students got the results that by and large they expected,” he said.
