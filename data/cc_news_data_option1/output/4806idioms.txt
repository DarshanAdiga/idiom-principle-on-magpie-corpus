On the heels of his record-breaking but unsuccessful bid to oust U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison on Tuesday launched a political action committee, utilizing his newly minted status as a fundraising powerhouse to try to provide a sustained boost to other Democrats that he hopes can help flip more areas from red to blue.
 Dirt Road PAC will focus on long term investments in state-level Democratic candidates and parties like intensive voter registration efforts in areas that have been seen by Democrats as harder to win, Harrison told The Associated Press ahead of the official launch.
 “The days of just swooping in every few years and putting up a candidate, having no grassroots infrastructure and thinking that we’re going to win - that’s just not working,” Harrison told the AP on Monday. “I’m going to focus on investing and doing it in a much deeper manner, and going into areas where people have just been forgotten, or been given up on.”
 First up, Harrison said, is fundraising for Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Georgia Democrats running in the pair of U.S. Senate runoffs that could shift the balance of the chamber, and for whom he has already directly raised nearly half a million dollars. After that, Harrison said he will focus on Virginia’s 2021 elections, before turning to the 2022 midterms.

For the next 20 years, up until 1998, Eskridge and Christiansen found that the Democratic-controlled Congress was “energized, aggressive, and highly … interventionist in matters of state policy” and therefore “happy to denounce and reverse antiregulatory” judicial rulings. Popular policy areas targeted for judicial overrides included civil rights, federal jurisdiction, and tax law, but were not limited to those. Even in the polarized decade of the 1990s, Congress overrode more than 80 rulings, more than in any of the preceding four decades. But following President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, judicial overrides slowed to a trickle.

 LONDRES (AP) — Justo a tiempo para quienes viajan en vacaciones, Inglaterra redujo su cuarentena obligatoria de dos semanas para quienes llegan de regiones que no están en la lista de zonas seguras de Gran Bretaña, a apenas 5 días si se da negativo en un test de coronavirus.
 El cambio, que se anunció el martes y entrará en vigor el 15 de diciembre, era muy esperado por la industria de los viajes, una de las más sacudidas por la pandemia. Ahora, las normas que rigen la cuarentena en Inglaterra se ajustarán a las de países europeos como Alemania.
 Según esto, los viajeros pueden reducir la cuarentena de 14 días pagando una prueba de detección del virus de una empresa privada en o después del quinto día de su llegada, con un costo potencial de alrededor de 100 libras (133 dólares). Los resultados suelen demorarse hasta 48 horas, aunque también pueden llegar en el mismo día.
 Los cambios no se aplicarán a quienes llegan de Irlanda del Norte, Escocia y Gales, que deberán aislarse por 14 días.
 “Nuestra nueva estrategia de pruebas nos permitirá viajar con más libertad, ver a nuestros seres queridos e impulsar los negocios internacionales', dijo el secretario de Transporte, Grant Shapps. “Al dar a la gente la opción de someterse a una prueba en el día 5, estamos respaldando también a la industria de los viajes, que sigue recuperándose de la pandemia'.
 Desde que se volvió a permitir viajar tras el confinamiento de primavera, los turistas británicos han enfrentado una situación incierta al dejar el país, ya que el gobierno ha modificado su lista de países seguros con poca antelación.
 Por otra parte, los 16 estados alemanes quieren que la población pase una cuarentena de varios días antes de visitar a sus familias en Navidad para reducir el riesgo de propagar el coronavirus entre los parientes de mayor edad y más vulnerables.
 Los gobiernos estatales acordaron entre ellos una propuesta para endurecer las medidas de confinamiento parcial en las próximas semanas, para que puedan relajarse durante las fiestas navideñas, reportó la agencia noticiosa dpa el martes.
 El plan, que sugiere también adelantar las vacaciones escolares y que las empresas faciliten el teletrabajo, se discutirá el miércoles en una videoconferencia con la canciller, Angela Merkel.
 En el último día, la agencia de control de enfermedades alemana registró 14.361 nuevos casos confirmados de COVID-19 y 249 decesos más.

Eriksen, 28, joined Inter Milan in January are departing Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in a deal which cost Antonio Conte’s side £24.3m, as per Transfermarkt.
 However, despite Eriksen’s move to the Serie A giants, the Danish star’s transfer has been one which has failed to work out after the midfielder continually finds himself left out of Conte’s starting-11.
 Eriksen has only managed to be directly involved in seven goals from 33 appearances in all competitions since his shock switch to Inter Milan nearly 12-months ago.
 In light of Eriksen’s shambolic form, the midfielder could be set for another switch after his long-term future was cast into doubt.
 According to Sky Sports Germany, Eriksen is set to be factored into a deal to bring Real Madrid’s Isco to Inter Milan which would see the Danish midfielder move the other way.
 It is understood that the upfront finances of the proposed deal could be a sticking point for Inter Milan as Real Madrid remain adamant they want between £54m and £63m for their Spanish star.
 Zinedine Zidane’s valuation of Isco is reportedly some way off how much Inter Milan view the attacking midfielder to be worth, which would suggest a successful transfer is still some way off.

As the subcommittee report outlined, antitrust law is relatively toothless right now—and that’s partly because the Court has so ratcheted up the standards for what kinds of cases parties can bring. “The practical effect is that antitrust laws are not routinely enforced. The goal of reform efforts is to ensure that the antitrust laws can actually reach antitrust violations,” said Lina Khan, a Columbia law professor who helped draft the majority report. Making it more difficult to be heard in court is a trend across the board, but Khan says it’s especially pronounced in antitrust law. But all this could change with Congress.

He added that while banks' investments in new payments systems have focused primarily on meeting compliance deadlines, the way they will drive value moving forward is by embracing the changing consumer dynamic and improving the customer experience.
