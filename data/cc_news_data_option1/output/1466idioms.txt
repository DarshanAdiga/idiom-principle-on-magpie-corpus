But the skeptics’ determination to catalog every petty tyranny inflicted in the name of quarantine is an important public service — not just because overreach always needs critics, but because petty tyrannies today are obstacles to the adaptation we need to get to semi-normalcy tomorrow.

European governments are deploying plans that subsidize worker pay at companies that have had to put employees on shorter hours or send them home. The idea is that companies keep workers on board so that they can quickly resume without having to recruit and train new staffers later. Their workers' spending also helps support other businesses. The system represents a sharp contrast to practices in the United States, where applications for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed.

Israeli-based Pluristem has treated its first American patient suffering from COVID-19 complications under the country's compassionate use program.
 The news comes days after a report by the company showed that six critically ill coronavirus patients in Israel who are considered high-risk for mortality were treated with Pluristem's placenta-based cell-therapy product and survived, according to preliminary data provided by the Haifa-based company.
 In the US case, the patient was treated with the company's PLX cell therapy at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey, where Pluristem is already running a Phase III critical limb ischemia study. Like the patients treated in Israel, this patient was critically ill with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated in an intensive care unit for three weeks.
 The company's president and CEO, Yaky Yanay, said that although Pluristem is focused on a planned multinational clinical trial for the treatment of complications associated with coronavirus, it does hope to expand treatment under compassionate use in other countries at the same time.
 Specifically, the US treatment was administered under the US Food and Drug Administration's Single Patient Expanded Access Program, which is part of the US Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program - an emergency program aimed at getting treatments to corona patients as quickly as possible.
 In Israel, the six patients were treated at three different Israeli medical centers for one week, also under a compassionate use program. They were suffering from acute respiratory failure and inflammatory complications associated with COVID-19. Four of the six patients also demonstrated failure of other organ systems, including cardiovascular and kidney failure.
 Not only had all the patients survived one week later, according to Pluristem, but four of them showed improvement in respiratory parameters and three of them are in the advanced stages of weaning from ventilators. Moreover, two of the patients with preexisting medical conditions are showing clinical recovery in addition to the respiratory improvement.
 Shortly after the preliminary data was published, Dr. Jason McCarthy, a senior managing director covering the biotechnology industry at Maxim Group praised Pluristem's efforts: "Pluristem shows the COVID-19 world the first clinical data for stem cells," he wrote. "Pluristem is initially evaluating its cell therapy under compassionate use authorization in Israel and is also the first company to dose COVID-19 patients, as well as produce the first set of early stage data."
 The company's results were described by Yahoo! Finance as "promising to say the least."
 "Weighing in for H.C. Wainwright, analyst Swayampakula Ramakanth calls the early data 'encouraging' and thinks the treatment could drive substantial gains for PSTI," the Yahoo! Finance article reported.
 PSTI is the company's NASDAQ listing.
 Pluristem's PLX cells are "allogeneic mesenchymal-like cells that have immunomodulatory properties," meaning they induce the immune system's natural regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages, the company explained in a previous release. The result could be the reversal of dangerous overactivation of the immune system. This would likely reduce the fatal symptoms of pneumonia and pneumonitis (general inflammation of lung tissue).
 Previous preclinical findings regarding PLX cells revealed significant therapeutic effects in animal studies of pulmonary hypertension, lung fibrosis, acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal injury.  

 "We are pleased with this initial outcome of the compassionate use program and committed to harnessing PLX cells for the benefit of patients and healthcare systems," Yanay said.

It's tough to talk about battery life objectively with our lifestyles disrupted. We don't go out as much as we used to during the global pandemic, and sitting at home on Wi-Fi isn't going to be indicative of how things will be when (if?) they go back to normal. Still, I can tell you what I got, and it was solid. At the maximum resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, using dark theme in system and most apps, I consistently hit almost seven hours of screen-on time over two days. I consider that solidly two-day battery life and pretty good compared to my experience on other devices, but I'm not sure yet how that might scale with more time spent out and about.

That means the $699 OnePlus 8 will be just as fast as the $1,599 Galaxy S20 Ultra when it comes to processor speed. OnePlus software optimization might tilt the balance in favor of the OnePlus 8, but the Galaxy S20 has a massive RAM advantage over the OnePlus 8. The S20 comes with faster LPDDR5 RAM and goes up to 16GB. Both the OnePlus 8 and Galaxy S20 start at 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage. The Snapdragon 865 chip also gives both phones support for 5G, including Verizon's speedier version of 5G technology.

 "There can be literally walls of cars, stop-and-go traffic or people in the park," she said. "So, for the bears, they normally have pick through these little corridors that they have to move through in the valley to get from Point A to Point B. ... Now, that there are no people the bears are literally just walking down the road to get to where they need to go, which is kind of cool to see."

Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge believes the prospects of the club winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League treble this season are remote.
 League champions Bayern preserved their five point advantage at the top of Germany’s top flight with a goalless draw at nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and are all square at 2-2 ahead of the home leg in the Champions League last-16 clash against Juventus.
 April brings a Pokal semi-final against Werder Bremen, meaning Manchester City-bound coach Pep Guardiola still has the chance to replicate Bayern's treble success from the 2012-13 campaign, which immediately preceded the former Barcelona boss' arrival at the Allianz Arena.
 But Rummenigge does not believe Guardiola must match Jupp Heynckes' achievement to be considered a success in Bavaria.
 "This [the treble] is rare, almost like a blue Mauritius," Rummenigge told Sky, comparing the feat to the exceedingly rare collectors' stamp.
 "We will see at the end of the day which of the silverware that I, Pep Guardiola and Bayern want is on the table."
 Rummenigge explained Guardiola's targets remain lofty and that the two men enjoy a strong relationship despite the 45-year-old's decision to seek a new challenge in the Premier League.
 "Everything that has elapsed between us is fair," he said. "In the discussions, he told me he wants to say goodbye as a friend of Bayern Munich.
 "He is 45 years old and would once again like to experience something different, but until then I wish him to win one or two titles with Bayern Munich."
 Rummenigge also spoke of his friendship with former club president Uli Hoeness, with speculation continuing that the former club president will regain a prominent role at Bayern following his release from prison, where he served half of a three-and-a-half-year term for tax evasion.
 "I always had a very close relationship with him," he added. "He was my first sleeping partner in a double room at Bayern Munich [when they were players].
 "Since then you have a close relationship with each other. In between, one has [arguments] sometimes when you disagree. But our conversations were always fruitful and found a decision for the common good of Bayern at the end."

Stranded in Nigeria for months, a Colorado couple had a rare chance to catch an evacuation flight to the U.S. recently during the coronavirus outbreak. But they refused because they would have had to leave behind their adopted daughter, who has yet to get a U.S. visa. “After we found our daughter and our daughter found us, it was out of the question to leave her,” Robin Gallite said. Gallite and her husband, Adebambo Alli, who live in Denver, are among several American families facing similar predicaments as the pandemic disrupts travel and slows the final steps needed to bring home children who were adopted abroad. The Virginia-based National Council for Adoption says it is following dozens of cases where the foreign adoption is complete and American parents are waiting for their child to receive a visa from the State Department. “We need to do the right thing and prioritize the health and safety of these families,” council vice president Ryan Hanlon said. The State Department says foreign adoptions remain a priority but has told families that with routine visa services suspended during the pandemic, their requests for emergency visas may not be granted swiftly, if at all. The adoption council says nearly all of the cases it's tracking are from Africa — where many countries, including Nigeria, are not part of the main international convention on adoption and investigations can take longer even under normal circumstances. Gallite, 41, and Alli, 42, have been in Nigeria since last August, when they arrived to complete the adoption of a baby girl. A Nigerian judge signed off in November, but obtaining a U.S. visa has moved slowly and is now in deeper limbo because of virus-related shutdowns.
