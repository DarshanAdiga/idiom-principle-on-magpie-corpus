Happy Friday?! It's been a bit of a wild ride since baby Luka decided he was ready to be earthbound. This pic was taken the day after I gave birth. I'm laughing from both the joy and the excruciating pain of childbirth and postpartum. Bringing this little human into the world has been THE most difficult and painful thing my body has had to go through, but it has also made me feel like a freakin' warrior... ALL women are warriors! Now here I am, double nursing (not something I was planning on doing), to the sounds of beautiful diaper music ... being a mom requires next-level strength and endurance, so thank you to all the people who have helped carry me through this process! And to all the mom's out there, know that I see you and honor you! #StrongLikeAMother Feliz viernes!? Mi vida a sido una locura deliciosa desde que Luka decidió que era su momento de aterrizar al mundo. Esta foto la tomamos al día siguiente de que nació. Me estoy riendo de felicidad y también del dolor insoportable de dar luz y del posparto. Traer a este chamaco al mundo ha sido lo más difícil y doloroso que mi cuerpo ha vivido pero también me ha hecho sentirme como una guerrera… TODAS las mujeres somos guerreras! Así que ahora me encuentro dando pecho a mis dos bebés (algo que no estaba planeando pero así es esto vrd?!) al sonido maravilloso de los pañales sucios… ser mamá requiere muchísimo así que agradezco tanto a todos los que me han ayudado y sostenido durante este proceso. Para todas las mamás, quiero que sepan que las veo y las honro. #FuerteComoMama

Chandigarh After four health workers, including three doctors, from Alchemist Hospital, Panchkula, were tested positive for Covid-19, the district health authorities have asked other private hospitals to review the precautionary measures in place."We have verbally communicated to Ojas Hospital and Paras Hospital, which are authorised to treat Covid-19 patients, to review the situation as per the latest guidelines," said nodal officer Dr Rajiv Narwal.Meanwhile, Alchemist Hospital on Friday claimed that they have sent a reply to the communication received from the district administration about shortcomings found in its working after an inspection on June 29."We were not served a show-cause notice, but were sent a document that had certain observations made by the committee. We are already working on the rectifications suggested," said hospital's medical superintendent Dr Paramjit Singh Mann, adding that the reception area will be shifted to a tent outside the main building and the entrance to the premises will remain one.After cases of infection among healthcare workers surfaced at the hospital, the assessment committee of Panchkula health department visited the hospital and submitted its report, which carried five observations and sought "rectification on urgent basis".It included poor crowd management , mixing of general and suspected cases at the entrance to the emergency, inadequate infection control practices, poor public awareness and making medical ICU operational before receiving reports of high risk contacts.With each observation, the committee also suggested "action that is required to be done". "It has suggested that all elective surgeries to be done with alternate timings for the next one month. All superspecialty and life-style clinics should be staggered, OPDs should run with alternate timings, proper disinfection of work station to be done in between the procedures," mentions the report, adding, "The flu corner needs to be shifted out of emergency area at a separate place well demarcated from general patients and highlighted by signage at strategic places at the entry area of the hospital."Apart from this, hand hygiene stations and waste bins should be available at all strategic locations across the hospital, the committee suggested.While directing the hospital to submit the action-taken report within 48 hours, the health department had also sought a list of high- risk direct contacts of Covid patients. Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said a meeting was also conducted with the hospital management.

 The 4th of July as well as summer in general means, among many things, fireworks may be filling the sky for all who wish to see them.
 With potentially millions of people\" looking up at the sky for the fireworks, they will have a chance to see the stars beyond.
 While waiting for the pyrotechnics to begin, usually scheduled when it is just getting dark enough to see them well, twilight will be well underway.
 If you are there for sunset, watch how the Earth's lovely star descends in a deep orange and red shade, and the deepening dusk paints the west-northwestern sky in a vivid, ever-changing palette of hues.
 With the sun set, you have a clear view to the east, look low on the horizon for the moon, only one day before full phase.
 See how the moon seems bigger than normal, being low on the horizon. This is actually an optical illusion.
 Look also for a deep violet band of color along the east-southeast horizon. This is the edge of the Earth's dark shadow, making a low angle on the sky. After a short time, as the sky darkens, the shadow will no longer be visible.
 We usually don't talk about the Earth's shadow until a time of a lunar eclipse when the moon passes through, darkening and turning a reddish shade.
 The red of sunsets and sunrises and the red of a lunar eclipse are the effect of refraction. The atmosphere enveloping the spherical Earth acts like a glass lens, and bends the rays of the sun, breaking them into its component spectrum. The longer wavelengths are on the red end of the spectrum and pass through the most.
 Unfortunately during July 2020, there are no bright planets in the evening sky. Otherwise, they would be among the first points of light to appear before the fireworks take our attention.
 Given a clear sky, what you will see are the wondrous points of light from the sky's brightest stars above the horizon at the time.
 Those who would like to make a wish on the first star you see would be following a very old tradition.
 The first star to appear will be Vega, magnitude 0.1 and blue-white in shade. Look high in the eastern sky.
 Next is Arcturus, magnitude 0.2 and of a wonderful yellow-orange hue. Arcturus stands high up in the south during the twilight of early July.
 The next brightest star is Altair, 0.9 and white. Look to the lower right from Vega, in the east-southeast.
 Antares, magnitude 1.2 and colored red, shines low in the south-southeast.
 Deneb, 1.3 and white, will be to the lower left from Vega, in the east- northeastern sky.   Vega, Deneb and Altair, although in different constellations, make up the famed \"Summer Triangle.\"
 Look low in the west for Regulus, a white magnitude 1.3 star.
 By the time fireworks begin, you won't likely be tracing constellations, and the bright rockets and flares will keep you fixated at the wonders a few hundred feet above your head.
 When the fireworks are over and most everyone is packing up to go home, perhaps to get in line for the ritualistic traffic jam that is often part of the 4th of July tradition, take a moment to catch more stars in the moonlit sky.
 Over the next couple of weeks, with the return of moonless skies, take in the glory of the universe.
 Fireworks are great, but don't miss a chance to see the thousands of stars dim and bright spread over your head, and the fascinating billows of the hazy Milky Way Band that becomes so prominent as a summer evening turns towards midnight and beyond.
 Learn to find the constellations, find out more star names and, with binoculars, hunt down even more treasures from star clusters to dim and very distant galaxies within your reach. The view is endless and waits to be seen!   Keep looking up at the sky!

Erik Zine was at Shaw's. Khai Delgado was on his couch. Adam Breault was checking his email.
 It may not rank that high on the where-were-you-when scale, but for many SouthCoast baseball players, the announcement of the independent Area X summer baseball league was a joyous moment.
 "It's pretty sweet," said Zine, who would have been a senior baseball player at Wareham High this spring. "It's definitely good to be back."
 "I didn't think we'd be back," said Breault, a former Old Rochester player whose UMass Boston team saw its season shuttered after four games. "We got the email and I was surprised, honestly. I figured there would be too many regulations. But I was excited."
 On a warm, blue-skied Friday evening, nearly two dozen Gateway (traditionally Post 220) players heaved long toss with rusty arms on the diamond at Rochester's Dexter Field. Pitchers and catchers worked in the bullpens. Coach Keith Delgado rapped out grounders to the hot corner.
 For a moment, life felt normal.
 Back in April, when the American Legion canceled its World Series, nothing felt normal.
 That was soon followed by the cancellation of the spring high school sports season, which was followed by the May 19 announcement that Massachusetts American Legion was pulling the plug on the summer season.
 Khai Delgado, who would have been a senior first basemen for the Vikings, was sitting on the couch with his dad, Keith, when they got the news.
 "I didn't get to play during the spring, now I wasn't going to be able to play during the summer and who knows if I'll get to play at the next level," Khai said. "We were having that conversation and (my dad) was like 'Screw this. Let's do everything we can.' He got right on the phone, email, calling all the other coaches in the district. He said 'Let's do this and have fun this summer.'"
 "These kids were getting one gut punch after another," said Keith Delgado. "Everything was being taken away from them, due to no fault of their own. We wanted to do it, as safely as possible, to let these kids get some sort of normalcy."
 The sliver of hope was a paragraph in the American Legion announcement that gave the green light for independent leagues outside the auspices of the Legion organization. So Delgado reached out to the 13 other teams in Zone 10.
 "We put our heads together as the district and asked 'Are we willing to do this?'" Delgado recalled. "We gave it a little time and discussed it. At the time, everybody was on board to look at it. A couple of teams said they didn't want to entertain it as we moved forward."
 Twelve teams initially agreed to play, then one more dropped out. Meanwhile, over in New Bedford, Post 1 coach Kurt Dreher was forwarded a short article about the efforts to create an independent league. Zone 9, New Bedford's division, had voted not to play an independent schedule, but Dreher decided to reach out to Delgado.
 "I saw Keith's name and I gave him a call," Dreher said. "They were pretty much all set and ready to move forward, but he scrambled and he got it done."
 New Bedford would join as the 12th team. The new league was dubbed Area X Baseball and will feature junior (13-15) and senior age groups (16-19). The seniors will be split into two divisions, North and South, with both Gateway and New Bedford playing in the South.
 The plan is to hold a 16-game schedule starting around July 6, followed by a league title game -- or possibly a double-elimination tournament if time allows -- between the South and North leaders in early August. There is some talk about a statewide tournament, as other zones such as 4 and 6 are adopting similar independent status.
 "We didn't want to do a rogue league," Delgado said. "We are going to follow the governor's rules. We're going to abide by everything he is putting out there."
 When Delgado sent out an email to the players he had expected back this summer. The response was overwhelming.
 "All these teams had so many more kids wanting to play than they could take," Delgado said. "That became a little bit of an issue trying to find places for kids to play. We had a lot of players interested."
 Wareham had about 50 players try out for the junior and senior teams, while New Bedford has 19 players out for its senior squad. Teams can roster up to 22 players, up from the 18 that Legion allows.
 "Every year with Legion the toughest task was getting a full roster, but not this year," Dreher said. "We kind of started putting the word out to see who would be interested in playing because it was so last minute, but everyone was in."
 While Wareham began practicing a couple of weeks ago, New Bedford held its first practice last Friday night.
 "It was great," Dreher said. "You could see it in the kids. It's been a long layoff for them. I told them they have all these rules to follow and they didn't complain. They were fine with it. They wore masks when they had to. You could tell they were all excited."
 Talking with a half-dozen players, most of them were chomping at the bit to return, but a couple said they initially were reticent.
 "At first I was a little skeptical about coming back," said Bishop Stang graduate Aaron James, who lives in Wareham. "After that long hiatus, I wondered if I'd be good enough still. But, it's been pretty good. The rules haven't been as bad as I thought."
 Players expressed varying degrees of comfort with the new rules, which include social distancing and mask wearing when that's not possible. There will be no high-fiving or group celebrations, no post-game handshake and dugout capacity will be limited. Some things are still being worked out, like whether a first baseman needs to wear a mask when a runner is on first.
 "It's weird," said former Old Rochester player Mike Barry, who now plays at Framingham State. "It's something we've never experienced before. We're still getting used to it. But whatever the rules are, I'm happy to be out here playing."
 "Weird" was the word of the day when discussing face masks and socially- distanced infield drills.
 "It's weird hearing Keith say to spread out, but other than that it's just baseball," Zine said. "I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait."
 "It's weird, but everywhere you go it's the same," Breault agreed. "It's not that bad of an adjustment. But I've never had to play sports with this type of regulation."
 This "new normal" will have more downside when the games begin.
 "It's not normal at all," said Bryson Uhlman, a Wareham resident who played at Sturgis East and now plays for Worcester State. "I guess we're getting used to wearing the masks, but I've never worn one to play a sport. The dugout thing? After someone gets a good hit and you can't high-five them? It all stinks. Nobody likes it, but it's better than not playing at all."
 Delgado spent much of his Friday practice reminding players not to congregate too closely together between drills, which was understandable considering the distance they've been forced to maintain over the past four-plus months.
 "I constantly yell at them to stay apart," Delgado said. "But one of the best things is this is what they want. They want to be around each other, even if it's a few feet apart. They want to enjoy themselves and be outside and play a game they've been playing since they were young. This is a great opportunity."
 It's especially rewarding for the Wareham seniors, who had just won the program's first playoff game in nine years as juniors in 2019 and only graduated four seniors, setting up high hopes for the 2020 campaign that never was.
 "It was kind of a tough pill to swallow because we had almost everyone coming back," Khai Delgado said. "We thought we could come back and compete for the conference and possibly win the conference. I was really hoping to put my mark on the school with the guys I've grown up with."
 Instead, Gateway, which is mostly composed of Wareham and ORR players, will try to do the same with a veteran, pitching-heavy roster.
 "We have a lot of good pitching this year," James said. "A lot of people came back. Our infield is pretty strong. We're looking pretty good all around."
 "I feel like we have a good pitching staff," Uhlman echoed. "All of us can hit. We have a lot of fast guys. I think our defense will be really good. It's a matter of if we can get our bats going."
 Meanwhile, over in New Bedford, Dreher is pretty confident in his team's ability at the dish.
 "I think we should hit," he said. "We have a good hitting team. Once we eye everything out, I think we'll hit. And as far as pitching, we have a lot of pitchers. Especially those first two weeks we should be able to split games."
 New Bedford's team -- which features players from New Bedford High, GNB Voc- Tech, Dartmouth, Fairhaven and Old Rochester -- will also have the benefit of playing with aluminum bats, as Zone 9 usually uses wooden bats.
 "Most of the kids showed up with wooden bats," Dreher chuckled.
 With just a week left until games are slated to start -- everything on the schedule is, of course, considered tentative at this point -- the players are itching to get back to competition. For many of them, they haven't played a meaningful baseball game since 2019.
 "I'm excited to come back out," Pearle said. "We haven't had much to do. It's fun to play baseball with my boys. It's good to get back out here."

They saw the old man coming in his bib overalls and started throwing rocks at the nest getting them all stirred up.
 When they settled back down, they went to the unsuspecting victim to rob the nest for the larvae to go fishing.
 He smiled and set out to oblige and followed them to the large nest still buzzing from the rock attack.
 The gang all stood back and watched as he rubbed his hand under his stinky armpit. As he got his fumigated hand about an inch from the nest, they nailed him. Folks all the way back in town heard the hysterical screams.
 The poor soul lived to tell the story but it broke up the wasp nest robbing for the remainder of his life!
 With Flor, mosquitoes have waged a war on her, also tiny insect terrorists.
 She loves the great outdoors and our yard shows it as she is slowly but surely turning it into a two-acre Bellingrath Gardens with all her floral array.
 She has a green thumb, often just taking a clipping from a plant like one of her rose bushes and sticking it into the ground and it survive to grow on out.
 But any part of her skin that is not covered gets stung by those pesky little things called mosquitoes.
 She reacts adversely as she must be allergic to them.
 The bite will swell and hurt her severely and all leave a permanent mark on her.
 There are other natural causes of pain around here, like the healthy crop of poison ivy that flourishes abundantly.
 I can just look at those 3 leaf plants and it seems go to itching!
 Yes, all is there to make all of our lives miserable, but in spite of it all enjoy the great outdoors.
 God bless you and God bless America.

BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts officials are urging boaters to take caution on the water after an increase in fatal accidents in the Northeast. Officials on Friday said the state's inland and coastal waters are expected to be busy over the July Fourth weekend. They reminded boaters to use flotation devices, to travel at reasonable speeds and to avoid operating under the influence of drugs or alcohol. More residents have been using the state's parks and waters recently, but “unfortunately we’ve also seen an increase in boating accidents in the commonwealth, some resulting in tragedy,” said Kathleen Theoharides, secretary of energy and environmental affairs. As of June 26, fatal boating accidents in the Northeast had doubled compared to the same period last year, according to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard says it will have an increased presence over the weekend as part of a national campaign to stop boaters operating under the influence. Theoharides also urged residents heading to beaches and parks to avoid large groups and to wear face coverings. “We encourage everyone who feels healthy to enjoy the great outdoors,” she said. “But it's still important that we all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

The researchers began their work by noting that several decades ago, other researchers had found that pairs of histidine and cysteine amino acids might be binding metal ions in the place where two types of histones met inside of cells. This suggested that histones might play a role in making copper safe for the body to use. To test this idea, the researchers set up and conducted two experiments, both involving yeast cells. The first experiment involved mutating amino acid sequences in histone proteins in the region suggested by the team in the prior study. They found that the cells with mutant histones had lower levels of Cu(I) ions, which are the safe form of copper. The researchers suggest this was evidence that histones play a role in the reduction process. In the second experiment, the researchers tested H3-H4 tetramers in test tubes and found that they did reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I).
