“I’m very blessed and honored to receive this award,” Silas said, “but if people just think of me as the athlete of the year and forget all the other things I stand for -- the kind of person I am -- I guess I’m not as excited about it.”
 More than anything, Silas prides himself on boldly sharing his faith and pushing his teammates to becoming better athletes. The latter has been a two- way street, too.
 “All my teammates have pushed me throughout the years, and I’m so grateful for them. But most of all, I’d say (my motivation) is my brother,” he said, laughing. “You can’t take a day off when your twin brother is Ben Hess.”
 “We hold each other to high standards,” Ben added. “A big part of my success and his success is pushing each other. … It helps us compete with everything we’ve got.”
 Silas will leave behind a love for high school athletics, forged through plenty of lessons that taught him what it takes to succeed. Undoubtedly, he was a quick study.
