In a statement, the FBI said it "maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment" and that claims against supervisors have resulted in them being removed from their positions while cases are investigated and adjudicated.
 It added that severe cases can result in criminal charges and that the FBI's internal disciplinary process assesses, among other factors, "the credibility of the allegations, the severity of the conduct, and the rank and position of the individuals involved."
 The AP review of court records, Office of Inspector General reports and interviews with federal law enforcement officials identified at least six allegations against senior officials, including an assistant director and special agents in charge of entire field offices, that ranged from unwanted touching and sexual advances to coercion.
 None appears to have been disciplined, but another sexual misconduct allegation identified in the AP review of a rank-and-file agent resulted in him losing his security clearance.
 The FBI, with more than 35,000 employees, keeps a notoriously tight lid on such allegations. The last time the Office of Inspector General did an extensive probe of sexual misconduct within the FBI, it tallied 343 "offenses" from fiscal years 2009 to 2012, including three instances of "videotaping undressed women without consent."
 The latest claims come months after a 17th woman joined a federal lawsuit alleging systemic sexual harassment at the FBI's training academy in Quantico, Virginia. That class-action case claims male FBI instructors made "sexually charged" comments about women needing to "take their birth control to control their moods," inviting women trainees over to their homes and openly disparaging them.
 In one of the new lawsuits filed Wednesday, a former FBI employee identified only as "Jane Doe" alleged a special agent in charge in 2016 retired without discipline and opened a law firm even after he "imprisoned, tortured, harassed, blackmailed, stalked and manipulated" her into having several "non- consensual sexual encounters," including one in which he forced himself on her in a car. The AP is withholding the name and location of the accused special agent to protect the woman's identity.
 "It is the policy and practice of the FBI and its OIG to allow senior executives accused of sexual assault to quietly retire with full benefits without prosecution," the woman's attorney, David J. Shaffer, alleges in the lawsuit.
 One such case involved Roger C. Stanton, who before his abrupt retirement served as assistant director of the Insider Threat Office, a division at Washington headquarters tasked with rooting out leakers and safeguarding national security information.
 According to an Inspector General's report concluded this year and obtained by AP through a public records request, Stanton was accused of drunkenly driving a female subordinate home following an after-work happy hour. The woman told investigators that once inside a stairwell of her apartment building, Stanton wrapped his arm around her waist and "moved his hand down onto her bottom" before she was able to get away and hustle up the stairs.
 After Stanton left, he called the woman 15 times on her FBI phone and sent her what investigators described as "garbled text" complaining that he could not find his vehicle. The heavily redacted report does not say when the incident happened.
 Stanton disputed the woman's account and told investigators he "did not intend to do anything" and only placed his arm around her because of the "narrowness" of the stairs. But Stanton acknowledged he was "very embarrassed by this event" and "assistant directors should not be putting themselves in these situations."
 Stanton retired in late 2018 after the investigation determined he sexually harassed the woman and sought an improper relationship. He did not respond to requests for comment from AP.
 Earlier this year, the Inspector General found that the special agent in charge of the Albany, New York, office, James N. Hendricks, sexually harassed eight subordinates at the FBI.
 Hendricks also was not named in the OIG report despite its findings. He was first identified in September by the Albany Times Union. One current and one former colleague of Hendricks confirmed his role in the case to AP.
 Hendricks now writes a law enforcement blog in which he touts his FBI accolades but makes no mention of the misconduct allegations. He did not respond to requests for comment.
 Becky, the former analyst, told AP she once believed FBI's "organizational values and mission aligned with how I was raised." But she was disabused of that notion after reporting to management that Charles Dick, a supervisory special agent at the FBI Training Academy at the time, sexually assaulted her at a farewell party.
 Becky told AP her assailant had threatened her at least two times before. "Once while we were waiting for the director he said, 'I'm going to touch your ass. You know it's going to happen.'"
 "His boorish behavior was well known," she added. "He was getting away with everything."
 In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Becky accused the former agent of wrapping his arm around her chest while posing for a photograph and "reaching under her and simulating" penetration of her "with his fingers through her jeans."
 Dick denied the charges and was acquitted in state court in Virginia by a judge who ruled it "wholly incredible" that Becky would "stand there and take it and not say anything," according to a transcript of the proceeding. Dick retired from the FBI months before the Inspector General followed up on Becky's internal complaint, Becky alleged in her lawsuit, adding she faced retaliation for coming forward.
 "It's much easier to suffer in isolation than it is to go public," she told AP. "But if I don't report it, I'm complicit in the cultural and institutionalized cover-up of this sort of behavior."

 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Britain warned the European Union on Thursday that it must make significant concessions to break the impasse in Brexit trade talks by the end of the weekend to give some finality to the five year Brexit crisis.
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union's chief executive gave themselves until the end of the weekend to seal a new trade pact after failing to overcome persistent rifts over a "lively" dinner of turbot on Wednesday.
 "There's still clearly some scope to keep talking but there are significant points of difference that remain," Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC TV. "(On) Sunday, they need to take stock and decide on the future of negotiations."
 "Sunday I think is an important moment," Raab told Sky News. "You never say never in these talks, but I think we do need to get some finality."
 Britain formally left the EU in January, but has since been in a transition period during which it remains in the EU single market and customs union, meaning that rules on trade, travel and business have stayed the same.
 That ends on Dec. 31. If by then there is no agreement to protect around $1 trillion in annual trade from tariffs and quotas, businesses on both sides will suffer.
 Failure to agree new rules to govern everything from car parts to Camembert would snarl borders, shock financial markets and sow chaos through supply chains in a world already grappling with the economic cost of COVID-19.
 Johnson portrays Brexit as a chance to give Britain a fully independent, more agile economy. EU powers fear London wants the best of both worlds - preferential access to EU markets but with the advantage to set its own rules.
 That, they say, would undermine the post-World War Two project which sought to bind the ruined nations of Europe - and particularly Germany and France - into a global trading power.
 Raab said the main points of contention - fisheries and commitments on a level playing field - were narrow in scope but they were matters of principle for Britain.
 He said "substantial movement" was needed on both issues for talks to continue.
 "I think you're getting a pretty clear signal that the Sunday stock take will be on the future of the negotiations and I think that also ought to help focus the minds of negotiators on both sides between now and then," he told BBC TV.
 Raab, said, however, that the EU's position on the level playing field had "hardened".
 The EU wants Britain to be remain tied to the bloc's labour, social and environmental standards in the future, as well as state aid rules for corporate state subsidies. (Reporting by Alistair Smout and Paul Sandle; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)

As I plug away at writing the materials-engineering-informed failure-analysis book that has been on and off my “Get it Done!” list since 2003, I have at last come to the part about writing the report. This flow chart (Fig. 1) represents my preferred method. When all goes well in the work, this chart shows quite closely how I actually work. I start at the large blue rectangle at upper left, stop to ask myself a final time if everything makes sense. If so, when I get to the blue diamond I’m ready to write in a fairly smooth process. Some of the steps may be fairly informal. Especially if it is a small project, I can keep most of my key points, findings, theories, conclusions and recommendations in my head until they flow out of my fingertips into the computer keyboard.


  When I showed this graphic to some colleagues for comments, however, a few of them did not like it. They said that it didn’t show each section of writing in the order it would appear. But I did that on purpose. If you have had to spend a lot of time in the big green NO rectangle, it may be easier and more efficient to just start writing the parts that are straightforward. If there is still a microstructure feature that doesn’t make sense, you can leave that part for last. Sometimes it gets clarified as you write the other sections. If not, then you will just have the longer task of explaining that there are some problems with the data and that there may be more work required before high confidence emerges.

Recasts after Williamson withdraws)
 By Greg Stutchbury
 WELLINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has withdrawn from the second test against West Indies and returned home to be with his pregnant wife, coach Gary Stead said on Thursday.
 Tom Latham will take over the captaincy.
 Williamson's availability for the test, which starts on Friday, had been up in the air for much of the day when the team said he had returned to Tauranga to attend a medical appointment with his wife, Sarah.
 Stead said after a lunchtime media conference that Williamson would return to the team and be available for the test at the Basin Reserve but later issued a statement saying the skipper had withdrawn.
 "Kane will return home," Stead said. "It's a decision we have come to around I guess the best interests for him and Sarah.
 "He is not the first person to have a baby and miss a test match and ... our thoughts are that mother and baby are well looked after and Kane needs to be there to support them in that way."
 Williamson, who scored a career-best 251 in the first match at Seddon Park in Hamilton, told reporters last week his wife was due to give birth to their first child "in mid-to-late December" and Stead had said the team supported him taking paternity leave.
 Wicketkeeper BJ Watling returns to the side and Tom Blundell will move up to open the innings with Latham after he dropped down the order and took the gloves in Hamilton.
 Will Young will replace Williamson while Devon Conway, who was brought in as batting cover, has been released to play for New Zealand 'A' in Nelson.
 Steady rain in Wellington since the weekend meant the teams have not had a proper look at the pitch, but Stead said it was likely they would go with four pace bowlers again.
 The only likely tossup decision to be made is whether all-rounder Daryl Mitchell or left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner takes the final spot.
 "We will make that call when we see the wicket," Stead said.
 "They are normally good wickets at the Basin and have good bounce and carry so hopefully if our seam bowlers bowl well they will have a big influence on the game."

Esther Miriam Zimmer Lederberg (1922 – 2006) was an American microbiologist, who discovered bacterial virus Lambda phage and the bacterial fertility factor F (F plasmid). Like many woman scientists of her time, Esther Lederberg was not given credit for her scientific contribution because of her gender. While her husband, her mentor and another research partner won 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering how genetic material was transferred between bacteria, Esther wasn’t even mentioned in the citation, even though her work significantly contributed to the discovery.
 Esther Miriam Lederberg was born in Bronx, New York, into a humble family, that moved from Sereth, Bukowina, a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and settled in the United States. At the age of 16, she won a scholarship to study biochemistry at Hunter College, City University of New York. In 1942, Esther won a fellowship to Stanford University to take a master's course in genetics. There she struggled to make ends meet. It has been mentioned in reports as recalled by Esther that she had sometimes eaten frogs' legs leftover from laboratory dissections.
 Esther met her future husband Joshua Lederberg at Stanford. They moved to the University of Wisconsin, where they would begin years of collaboration. Esther also earned her Ph.D there. Throughout the 1950s, they published papers together and apart as both made discoveries about bacteria and genetics of bacteria.

Seeing the policies enacted by other schools also influenced Biederwolf’s opinion.


  “I’ve always felt that our break was a lot shorter than all of my other friends who went to different schools anyway,” Biederwolf said. “I don’t think that it’s going to be an issue for us.”


  Andrew Wolfram agreed with Biederwolf.


  “Longer breaks are common to students; they’ve always had summer and they’re always able to come back and do work then,” Wolfram (graduate-organic chemistry). “Having been both a student and a TA, student performance is better in the fall semester, so a long break before a semester tends to help those students.”


  Despite the controversy, students like Eric Larson, Emma Car, Kramer and Wolfram agreed that the university’s decision will benefit student and faculty health in the long run.


  “I think it’s important that the university [is] erring on the side of caution,” Larson (senior-industrial engineering) said. “I think it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with what’s going on.”


  For Carr (senior-advertising and public relations), her studies in public relations played a large role in her opinion of the university’s decision.


  “From a PR standpoint, I know it looks good for the university to try to look like they’re mitigating, and they are mitigating,” Carr said.

MEXICO CITY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Mexico's Senate approved a controversial law on Wednesday that would oblige the central bank to buy up cash that commercial banks cannot return to the financial system, fanning concerns it could end up taking in laundered money from drug cartels.
 Pitched by the party of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as a way to help migrants pass on cash that financial controls have made it tougher for them to unload, the bill has caused strong friction with the central bank over its autonomy.
 The initiative, which must now pass to the lower house, has stirred up unease in the finance industry, which is mindful of the risk of being caught handling cash of illicit origin.
 The Bank of Mexico had flagged concerns over the bill and board member Gerardo Esquivel quickly criticized its passage.
 "(It's) regrettable the Senate approved reforms to the Bank of Mexico law which put the international reserves at risk and undermine the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico," Esquivel said on Twitter, urging the lower house to remedy the situation.
 Later, the central bank issued a blunt statement, warning that the bill could get Mexican financial institutions into trouble and spread "contagion" to the Bank of Mexico.
 "The draft law would oblige the central bank to carry out high-risk operations that could compromise the availability of the international reserves and the fulfillment of its constitutional mandate," the bank said.
 Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement party denies the bill could compromise the central bank and says it will help poor migrant families disadvantaged by the financial system.
 But critics say that even if well-intentioned, the bill risks putting the central bank on a slippery slope to increasing interference from lawmakers eager to make more use of it. (Reporting by Noe Torres and Dave Graham; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)

Waller was suspended four games in 2016 and all of 2017 because of drug violations. He spent most of 2018 on the Ravens’ practice squad before the Raiders plucked him away late that season.
 He blossomed into one of the top tight ends in the league last season with 90 catches for 1,145 yards, which helped him earn a long-term deal with the Raiders.
 He has built on that this year, ranking second among all tight ends with 77 catches for 742 yards to go along with seven TDs.
 “I feel like this season I’ve improved as a player and a person,” Waller said. “Of course, there’s been games where the numbers weren’t what people may have expected. Every week my mindset is whether I have 20 yards or 200, I still come to work the next week with the same mindset each day and stay on top of my habits and let the results take care of themselves.”

 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery almost ground to a halt in October as a surge in coronavirus cases dealt a blow to the hospitality sector, official figures showed on Thursday.
 Gross domestic product rose 0.4% on the month after expanding 1.1% in September, the Office for National Statistics said, the weakest growth since output collapsed in April during the first lockdown.
 Britain has Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19, with more than 62,000 fatalities, and also suffered the biggest economic hit of any major economy after GDP shrank by an unprecedented 19.8% in the second quarter of this year.
 Output in October was 7.9% lower than it was in February, before the pandemic struck Britain's economy, the ONS said, and 8.2% weaker than in October 2019.
 Government forecasters do not expect the economy to regain its pre-COVID size until the end of 2022 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted that Britain's recovery would be weaker than anywhere bar Argentina.
 "The economy continued to grow in October, but at a snail's pace. And with the COVID-19 restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, the economy is in for a difficult few months yet," Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics said.
 Although the economy picked up rapidly after the initial shock of the lockdown, it lost momentum as COVID cases started to rise again in September and accelerated in October.
 Government restrictions on socialising in much of the United Kingdom, as well as greater caution from some of the public, led to a 14.4% fall in output across the accommodation and restaurant sector.
 Business surveys in October had already shown a slowdown in growth, and most economists think output fell outright in November, when the government imposed a four-week partial lockdown in England, which closed non-essential shops and most hospitality venues.
 However, the decline is expected to be much more limited than in the first lockdown, when restrictions were tighter and businesses had less time to adapt.
 The end of a post-Brexit transition period will also pose a challenge for many businesses from Jan. 1, when exporters will face new border checks for goods they want to sell in the EU, and potentially tariffs as well.

With Jake LaTurner heading off to Washington, D.C., soon, Gov. Laura Kelly will be appointing a new Kansas state treasurer. No doubt she has a list in her office right now of fine, capable, upstanding people who have years of public service and money-management credentials on their resumes.
   
 The governor might want to throw that list out and create a new one, because the person for the job should be a promoter first and foremost.
   
 From the job title, you would think that the state treasurer is a financial mastermind, investing and manipulating the billions of dollars running through the state. Not exactly. The state treasurer sits on two committees -- the KPERS Board of Trustees (one of nine members) and the Kansas Pooled Money Investment Board (one of five members) -- that oversee the investment of state retirement and general fund monies.
   
 The treasurer has a vote at these meetings, and then has time on his or her hands to do other things.
   
 One of the things treasurers like to do is run for higher office. Since 1972, every single elected Kansas treasurer has gone on to run for another office. Joan Finney became governor, and the past three treasurers -- LaTurner, Ron Estes and Lynn Jenkins -- won election to the U.S. Congress. Tom Van Sickle, Tim Shallenburger and LaTurner didn't even get through one term before dreaming of bigger things. LaTurner announced he was running for U.S. Senate a scant two months after being elected to his first term as treasurer.
   
 But that's OK, because the modern job of treasurer now demands a promoter rather than a money manager.
   
 The treasurer can hire good people to do the money stuff, but as one of six officials elected statewide, only the treasurer can command the media spotlight needed to successfully promote several key programs administered by the office. These are the state's program for unclaimed property and money, the Kansas 529 college savings program, and the treasurer's high school scholarship program.
   
 LaTurner understood the promotional role of the treasurer. He excelled at it and took it to a new level by featuring himself and his family in his office's 529 promotional TV ads. Let me humbly state that I was wrong to be critical of those ads when they first appeared.
   
 I didn't understand then what I've come to see now, which is that the new role of the state treasurer requires a person who is not only willing to use the spotlight to promote the state's programs but is also highly talented in doing so. To give you an example of my point, how many of you remember Ron Estes' or Dennis Mckinney's 529 TV ads? Total snoozeville.
   
 LaTurner is the exception. Somewhat surprisingly, most politicians are not impressive promoters nor particularly good on TV, so Gov. Kelly should think outside the box when making her choice.
   
 Look at people from the media business, like television newscasters and presenters, people who know how to connect through television and the modern mediums of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
   
 Look for someone who might raise a few eyebrows at first, but when their first 529 or unclaimed property TV ads start airing, will make us all see that the governor did in fact pick someone well qualified for the modern job of Kansas treasurer.

This set of attitudes was mobilised and elevated in US, Brazil and India, far beyond the European sphere. The salience of identity politics seems to have a renewed power and has become a source of mobilising political action.”

 WICHITA -- A Paola woman was sentenced Dec. 3 to more than 11 years (135 months) in federal prison for methamphetamine trafficking, U.S. Attorney or Kansas Stephen McAllister said.
 April Lunsford, 39, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. The case began when the Kansas Bureau of Investigation started looking into a trafficking organization that was distributing methamphetamine in the Kansas City, Kan., area. Lunsford sold methamphetamine four times to buyers working undercover for law enforcement.
 During the investigation, Lunsford was arrested and charged in Miami County District Court in connection with the death of 23-year-old Heather Briggs. Lunsford pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 98 months in state prison.
 Also on Dec. 3, a Dodge City man, Danny Del Real, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for methamphetamine trafficking, McAllister said.
 Del Real, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing methamphetamine.
 In October 2018, a confidential informant working with the Dodge City Police Department paid Del Real $5,000 to purchase approximately a pound of methamphetamine. When tested, the package contained the equivalent of about eight-tenths of a pound of pure methamphetamine.
 McAllister commended the KBI, the FBI and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheri Catania for their work on the Lunsford case; and the Dodge City Police Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the KBI and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Metzger for their work on the Del Real case, respectively.

Ridge to Rivers won't implement regular conditions-related closures at the trail to Table Rock this winter, according to a Tuesday afternoon Facebook post from the organization, which manages the bulk of Boise's Foothills trails.
 Starting in 2016, Ridge to Rivers began gating off the trailhead near the Old Idaho Penitentiary when the route was muddy, as activity on the wet ground can churn the soil, leading to ruts, trail widening and other damage. Last year, Ridge to Rivers reported numerous users disregarding the gate and using the trail in poor weather conditions.
 "Trail users consistently climb over locked gates to access the trails, disregarding large signage clearly indicating that the trails are closed and disregarding conversations with Ridge to Rivers staff on-site, attempting to explain the closure," Ridge to Rivers program manager David Gordon said in the Facebook post.
 Rather than assessing the trail daily, as it did in the past, Ridge to Rivers said it plans to close the gate after significant rain or snow. The trails in the Table Rock area are among several in the Boise system that are on clay- heavy soil. In the past, they've sustained significant damage from use in unfavorable conditions. In the winter, the trails can become wet when morning frost thaws later in the day.

 “Milo was microchipped but the chip didn’t match the address and he also had false vaccination papers.
 “We are warning the public to be extra vigilant when buying a puppy and not to accept any excuse not to see the puppy with mum.
 “The public needs to remember that these low-welfare breeders are master manipulators and are skilled at deceiving people. No matter how plausible the excuse, do not accept it. You must see pup with mum, that is the bottom line.
 “We would always advise adopting over buying a pet but those with their hearts set on buying a puppy should do their research and make sure they are buying from a responsible breeder.
 “Although you may have to wait slightly longer, you will be getting a happy and healthy dog. Often in these cases puppies like Milo are taken from their mothers far too early and are not strong enough to survive.
 “This case very sadly shows the reality of this abominable trade and the devastating consequences.
 “There has been a huge spike in low welfare puppy farming due to coronavirus.

One of the more appalling moments in the recent history of the House of Representatives occurred recently in the Capitol Visitor Center. Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave her weekly news conference and said that she had changed her position on the issue of passing a coronavirus relief bill. For months, as millions suffered the economic devastation associated with the pandemic, Pelosi stonewalled the Trump administration’s efforts to pass targeted, short- term relief for those in need. Now, as if by magic, she’s all for it.
 What happened? A new president has been elected, Pelosi explained, and coronavirus vaccines are nearing public distribution. “A total game-changer — a new president and a vaccine,” she declared. The kind of short-term relief that she blocked for months is now acceptable. “It’s for a shorter period of time, but that’s OK now,” Pelosi said, “because we have a new president.”
 As policy, it made no sense. Why condition help for struggling Americans on the development of a vaccine? Didn’t the lack of a vaccine in the last several months, with a virus raging and no end in sight, make it more urgent to help people? Yet Pelosi wouldn’t do it. And why refuse to assist suddenly unemployed Americans until President Trump had been defeated in his bid for reelection? The speaker’s explanation revealed the cold political calculations behind her actions. But it also suggested the personal obsession driving her refusal to approve aid at a time when millions of Americans were out of a job, stretching to pay the rent, struggling to buy food and desperately trying to make ends meet.

The Senate is expected to easily pass the bill before midnight Friday to avert a partial government shutdown. Meanwhile, negotiations continue over another round of virus aid.

 Based on the data provided, it’s clear that DoorDash is an interesting play for growth investors to consider. While I am generally afraid to buy into names like this because of their uncertain futures, I do think that it could be an exception to this rule of thumb. Amazing growth this year and a sprint toward profits and positive cash flows is most definitely encouraging. Yes, shares do still look pricey with the company valued at $60.2 billion, but in two or three years investors may look back and realize that this was still the early stage of a paradigm shift the company is at the forefront of.

SALINA -- Salvation Army Capt. Lynn Lopez said Tuesday that Salina's Red Kettle Campaign received a gift worth over $1,800.
   
 Lopez said someone from Ryan Roofing in Salina, who did not want to be named, donated a gold coin in person. The person did not want to put it in one of the kettles for fear of it getting lost.
   
 "I've been waiting 10 years to get one of these coins into a red kettle," Lopez said jokingly. "I believe that God is pouring out such a gift in this community and it will help us not only reach our goal but possibly exceed our goal in a pandemic year which is incredible. This is truly a once in a lifetime gift. It is going to be hard to let it go because it is so pretty,"
   
 The Red Kettle Campaign has a goal of $107,554 this year and is at about 70% of that goal, Lopez said.
   
 Lopez said the goal has been exceeded every year since she came on board four years ago.

 With Jake LaTurner heading off to Washington, D.C., soon, Gov. Laura Kelly will be appointing a new Kansas state treasurer. No doubt she has a list in her office right now of fine, capable, upstanding people who have years of public service and money-management credentials on their resumes.
 The governor might want to throw that list out and create a new one, because the person for the job should be a promoter first and foremost.
 From the job title, you would think that the state treasurer is a financial mastermind, investing and manipulating the billions of dollars running through the state. Not exactly. The state treasurer sits on two committees -- the KPERS Board of Trustees (one of nine members) and the Kansas Pooled Money Investment Board (one of five members) -- that oversee the investment of state retirement and general fund monies.
 The treasurer has a vote at these meetings, and then has time on his or her hands to do other things.
 One of the things treasurers like to do is run for higher office. Since 1972, every single elected Kansas treasurer has gone on to run for another office. Joan Finney became governor, and the past three treasurers -- LaTurner, Ron Estes and Lynn Jenkins -- won election to the U.S. Congress. Tom Van Sickle, Tim Shallenburger and LaTurner didn't even get through one term before dreaming of bigger things. LaTurner announced he was running for U.S. Senate a scant two months after being elected to his first term as treasurer.
 But that's OK, because the modern job of treasurer now demands a promoter rather than a money manager.
 The treasurer can hire good people to do the money stuff, but as one of six officials elected statewide, only the treasurer can command the media spotlight needed to successfully promote several key programs administered by the office. These are the state's program for unclaimed property and money, the Kansas 529 college savings program, and the treasurer's high school scholarship program.
 LaTurner understood the promotional role of the treasurer. He excelled at it and took it to a new level by featuring himself and his family in his office's 529 promotional TV ads. Let me humbly state that I was wrong to be critical of those ads when they first appeared.
 I didn't understand then what I've come to see now, which is that the new role of the state treasurer requires a person who is not only willing to use the spotlight to promote the state's programs but is also highly talented in doing so. To give you an example of my point, how many of you remember Ron Estes' or Dennis Mckinney's 529 TV ads? Total snoozeville.
 LaTurner is the exception. Somewhat surprisingly, most politicians are not impressive promoters nor particularly good on TV, so Gov. Kelly should think outside the box when making her choice.
 Look at people from the media business, like television newscasters and presenters, people who know how to connect through television and the modern mediums of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
 Look for someone who might raise a few eyebrows at first, but when their first 529 or unclaimed property TV ads start airing, will make us all see that the governor did in fact pick someone well qualified for the modern job of Kansas treasurer.

The investment outlook for 2021 looks positive as policymakers will likely err on the side of caution or, shall we say, “generosity.” With this as the backdrop, we continue to expect that regional and sector rotation will become a more noticeable feature of the next leg up in equities. Value-dominated equity markets such as Canada, Australia and Europe should outperform the S&P 500 and its FAANG stalwarts, suggesting a period of significantly greater market breadth than that which has been experienced in years. On sector rotation, long forgotten “no-tech” sectors such as materials, industrials and financials should make their way to the top of the performance list as pent-up consumer demand drives a rebound in global economic activity. Commodity markets will remain tight due to increased demand for housing, autos and other durables, while gold should benefit from a decline in the U.S. dollar and some rise in cyclical price inflation.

Legendary actor Dilip Kumar turns 98 tomorrow. His fans and colleagues from the industry wish him every year for his good health and this year will be no different. His wife and actor Saira Banu reveals there are no plans for celebrations this year. "We are still unable to come to terms with the passing of our brothers, Ahsan bhai and Aslam bhai. Moreover, Sahib never plans anything for his birthday. In fact, he remembers the event only when he sees the flowers sent by his friends and well-wishers, lining the drawing room and the foyer and the phone keeps ringing ceaselessly," she shares.
 Earlier this week, Saira Banu had said that the veteran actor was a bit weak but doing well otherwise.Looking forward to the day, she explains, "The day is an event for all of us but not for him. Of course, he is touched by the affection and appreciation because he always respects his fans whose admiration for his work is more valuable to him than any popular award."


 In the years gone by, the atmosphere on his birthday was different, she states. Friends and family would visit and so did fans who wanted a glimpse of the megastar. "In the past, we kept an open house for our well-wishers and even though it was rather tiring, Sahib met everyone without exception and ensured that everyone was fed delicious food," says Banu.
 With the pandemic and Covid-19, this year has been tough for many. And the couple faced their own share of loss. "It was terrible for us as we lost our two dearest brothers this year... How can we forget that?" she says. During the lockdown, the couple had shared an audio message on Twitter urging people to stay at home. She says, adding, "Otherwise, in the past few years, we had automatically cut down on our travels, as we had travelled a lot in our lives. So, we did not feel any different staying at home in the lockdown or after that. Especially, since God has given us homes with huge gardens, where one is delighted to watch birds and squirrels playing about in the greenery of the trees.. Maasha Allah!"

“It’s great that Rachel was able to document her last semester at Penn State,” Robert said. “I hope she can bring positivity to her viewers with healthy eating and a healthy relationship with food.”


  According to Kelly Boland, one of Kim’s friends from Penn State, Kim’s upbeat personality and college-themed content is perfect for those who want to gain a better insight on the life of a college student.


  “I’m not surprised she gained so many subscribers,” Boland (senior-veterinary and biomedial sciences) said. “She has the feel-good content a lot of people are looking for.”


  Kim said she does not plan on pursuing lifestyle vlogging as a career, but she intends to continue making content for her channel after graduation and throughout medical school.


  Kim will graduate with an undergraduate degree this month before beginning the remainder of a 7-year medical school program at Penn State.


  “I want this channel to show my life journey and I want my community on YouTube to be able to relate with me,” Kim said. “There’s definitely a long way to go.”


  To Kim, the best part of her success on YouTube is knowing she has had a positive influence on her viewers.


  “People started messaging me on Instagram saying I changed their life and that I helped them overcome an eating disorder,” Kim said. “I know how it feels to not have a great relationship with food, so when I hear those comments, that’s what keeps me going.”

The House on Wednesday easily passed a temporary funding bill that sets a Dec. 18 deadline for Congress to wrap up both a virus relief measure and a $1.4 trillion government spending bill. The Senate is expected to easily pass the bill before midnight Friday to avert a partial government shutdown. Meanwhile, negotiations continue over another round of virus aid. Leaders are in agreement about helping small businesses and preserving extra unemployment benefits, but disagree over the details of the package.

This will include being more aware of the people around us including all the people that we call central workers who we once regarded as below or outside our radar. We see them now. Zooming is as much about a mindset as it is a set of behaviors. It's about taking the time to think more carefully about our lives choices and patterns and change the things that haven't worked for us. And don't be surprised if you see friends and relatives make radical change in 2021. Switching to more meaningful pursuits you see a great deal of career change right now. Moving into a tinier home, in a more temperate climate, going back to school for a dance degree".

San Diego County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher immediately sent a public shout- out to his wife, state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who, along with a coalition of other legislators, asked for the reversal in a joint letter last week.


  On Dec. 8, Fletcher was one of three county supervisors who declined to follow the lead of colleague Jim Desmond, who proposed having county staff refrain from enforcing playground closures.


  Fletcher in a statement Dec. 9 indicated he and many others were working behind the scenes to push Gov. Gavin Newsom for the change.


  “Thank you to everyone who worked cooperatively with the state to bring about this adjustment; our collective efforts made a difference, special shout-out to my wife, supermom Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez,” Fletcher said in a statement.


  Desmond, who has said repeatedly that there is no evidence that playground exposures are driving the pandemic, was equally celebratory.


  “Common sense and the pressure of the people finally broke through in Sacramento,” he said in a statement. “Throughout the past eight months, I’ve tried to follow the science and data. If you follow the science, there was no reason playgrounds should have ever been closed. I’m glad families will now have a much-needed outlet for their kids.”


  San Diego County’s daily coronavirus report Dec. 9 included 2,104 new cases and 15 additional deaths. A total of 547 patients were in intensive care unit beds, leaving 137 unoccupied.


  The rate of positive tests stood at 8 percent, significantly higher than the 3 percent to 5 percent that was common when the number of coronavirus-related admissions was stable.


  The direction of the positivity rate over time is considered key to understanding whether the public is curtailing gatherings and wearing masks or ignoring restrictions.

HAYS -- During the month of December, Sunrise Agribusiness Solutions LLC, headquartered in Hays, will be donating $0.01 for every bushel of grain sold to Sunrise to the Salvation Army.
   
 "We've been in business here for about a year and a half and wanted to find a way to give back to the communities we serve, especially in light of the pandemic," said Sunrise ABS president and CEO Travis Brunner. "My wife and I came up with this idea to give back through the grain we purchase."
   
 With the project, called Grain that Gives, Brunner said grain buyers from offices in Hays, Kansas City, Salina and Colby will keep track of where they are buying grain and give back to that Salvation Army extension.
   
 "So far in December we have purchased more than 600,000 bushels of grain," Brunner said. "This means we are making a $6,000 donation to the Salvation Army in districts across the state so far."
   
 Brunner said support for Grain that Gives is coming from other commodity buyers as well.
   
 "We have an end user, Scott Foote of Foote Cattle Co., who also wanted to help out our Kansas communities in his own way, so he has committed to matching the funds we donate to the Salvation Army and give a penny per bushel for grain that he buys from us for his five feedlots," Brunner said.
   
 Brunner said Sunrise ABS focuses on ag consulting with producers, commercial elevators and end users. The company works with producers and ranchers to help them make solid business decisions when it comes to their operation, including grain and cattle.
   
 Farm Direct, an additional farm and ranch resource championed by Sunrise ABS, helps provide optionality and flexibility for producers to take their grain to the best markets possible, Brunner said.
   
 To learn more about how Grain that Gives can benefit a particular community, call the Sunrise office at 785-301-1164 or visit www. sunriseabs.com.

Concerned that their credibility is at stake, European Union leaders are set Thursday to give the green light to the expansion of sanctions against Turkey over its exploration of gas reserves in Mediterranean waters claimed by EU members Greece and Cyprus.
 At their last summit in October, the leaders offered “a positive political EU- Turkey agenda” to Ankara, including trade and customs benefits and the prospect of more funds to help Turkey manage Syrian refugees on its territory if it halts its “illegal activities” in the eastern Mediterranean.
 But EU foreign ministers agreed this week that Turkey’s behavior has not improved, and Thursday’s summit is shaping up as a “crucial” meeting for EU- Turkey relations.
 “All of them considered that we have not seen a fundamental change of direction,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters after chairing a videoconference between the ministers on Monday. “In several aspects the situation has worsened.”

"My goal is just to block someone so hard to where someone in the stands is like, 'Wow. Look at him. No. 82 is moving somebody,'" Parker said. "That's always been my goal going into the game. That's why if you see a big block from me or something, I'm focused in, locked on, trying to get it done."


  Parker set the tone against the Hogs, Drinkwitz said. Once the Mizzou sideline saw the physicality he was imposing against the Arkansas defense, that hyped them up. Parker aided an MU rushing attack that thrived, running all over the Hogs for 273 yards.


  It's been an up-and-down past year for Parker, a Blue Springs High graduate. He had to have emergency surgery after an eye infection last winter, which knocked him out for spring ball (though that was cut short because of the pandemic). While Parker played Saturday, an injury had kept him out for more than a month.


  "I thank God every morning, every day for blessing me to still be able to step on the field," Parker said. "Even if I couldn't step on the field, I still thank God for giving me the ability to see each and every day. It's definitely a blessing. I don't really sit back and dwell on it."


  Parker's return gives Mizzou more options at tight end, the game's most versatile position. He made a positional switch during preseason camp his freshman year in 2018, moving from defensive line to tight end out of necessity.


  That gives MU a 1-2 punch between Parker and fellow tight end Niko Hea as they specialize in different areas. Hea has been the receiving target, racking up 12 receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown this season. Parker is the guy who punches the opposition in the mouth.


  While Mizzou's offense is based out of "11" personnel -- one tight end and one running back -- Drinkwitz's offense has featured some "12" in certain game situations. That bumps up the tight end count to two, giving the Tigers more choices.


  "He's a really talented player that we're always excited when he's in the game," Drinkwitz said. "He does everything that we ask him to do. We're very appreciative of what he means to our football team."


  Parker had been out with an undisclosed injury since the Kentucky game. It's another setback, but Parker said he felt like he "didn't skip a beat" during the absence. That came from preparation mentally, learning the playbook while making his way back physically.


  "One thing I will say is that it has changed my perspective on the game and life," Parker said. "I'm actually glad I had to go through these things because it slowed me down to get a better look on life."

Texas State abandoned the long-range shot after halftime, taking just two and missing both. Instead, Johnson had his players run more “Horns” actions — in which the Bobcats’ bigs set ball screens on both the left and right sides — to find more paint touches. The visitors’ field goal percentage jumped from 28.1% in the first half to 44.8% in the second half. The maroon and gold also got to the free-throw line more often, going 7-9 at the stripe in the second after missing their only attempt in the first.

BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders are set to give the green light to the expansion of sanctions against Turkey over its contested exploration of gas reserves in Mediterranean waters claimed by EU members Greece and Cyprus. At their last summit in October, the leaders offered trade and other incentives to Turkey to halt its “illegal activities.” But EU foreign ministers agreed this week that things have only got worse, and the Europeans are concerned that their credibility is on the line if they don't act. Last year, the EU set up a system for imposing travel bans and asset freezes on people, companies or organizations linked to contested drilling activities. Two Turkish Petroleum Corporation officials are already on the list.

The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
 While President-elect Joe Biden has signaled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
 "By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains," Xinhua said.
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
 Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
 On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was "poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends."
 Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
 Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
 "Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non- conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation," Xinhua said. "The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."

This growth in revenue was caused by a surge in the company’s orders. So far this year, orders have totaled 543 million. This compares to 181 million the same time last year. As a result of this increase in orders, Marketplace GOV so far this year has been $16.49 billion (with $7.25 billion, or 44%, of this coming in the third quarter alone). This compares to $5.54 billion the same timeframe in 2019. While it is possible some of this growth could reverse once the COVID-19 pandemic wears off, the small share of the market that DoorDash has relative to the overall restaurant and foodservice space makes it more likely that growth was due in part not to a temporary increase in demand, but instead to a frontloading of years of market growth onto it and other services like it.
 One issue that still exists, but that is showing some signs of improving, is the company’s profitability. After all, profits are what matter the most in the long run for determining a company’s value. And for years, the business has suffered on this front. In 2018, for instance, DoorDash generated a net loss of $207 million. This more than tripled to a loss of $668 million last year. Operating cash flow and EBITDA were similarly negative, with operating cash outflows totaling $159 million in 2018 and $467 million in 2019, while EBITDA was negative to the tune of $158 million and $475 million in these respective years.
 Though this picture was worsening during this period, 2020 has shown something of a turnaround so far. In the first three quarters this year, the company lost just $149 million. This is far less than the $534 million loss seen the same period a year earlier. Other metrics have fared even better during this period. EBITDA swung from a negative $372 million to a positive $95 million, while operating cash flows swung from a negative $308 million to a positive $315 million. This is the right direction and it’s not unthinkable that in another year or two the company might be generating consistent positive earnings, cash flow, and EBITDA. It also seems to have plenty of cash on hand with which to do it. Prior to going public, the firm had $1.61 billion in cash and cash equivalents. With shares priced at $92.50, the firm was expecting net proceeds of $2.96 billion, so with the business going public at a price of $102, this should be closer to $3.26 billion. That would bring cash up to $4.88 billion.
