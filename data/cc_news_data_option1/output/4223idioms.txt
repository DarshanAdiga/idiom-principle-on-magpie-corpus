Democrats won this seat in the 2018 midterms, but then Rep. Jeff Van Drew switched parties and cozied up to the President. That may have looked like a safe strategy for a South Jersey district that Trump carried by about 5 points. But times have changed. Public polling has given Biden a slight edge here, with nearly half of voters saying they're bothered by the congressman's party switch. Democrat Amy Kennedy is leaning into that message, hitting Van Drew in a recent ad by saying she'll "never trade her South Jersey values to benefit myself." The wife of former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy was at 49% to Van Drew's 44% among registered voters in Monmouth University's early October survey. That's within the margin of error. But it doesn't look like Van Drew's getting much outside help to put him over the top.

Fermented plant extracts refer to those products that come with fermented whole food items, vegetables, flowers, and fruits. These extracts come with high content of nutrients and are made of amino acids and essential vitamins. Fermented plant extract is more or less similar to readymade compost manure. Besides, these extracts are entirely organic and are considered much better option in comparison with chemical fertilizers. Chemical fertilizers are known to be toxic for plants and could also prove to be harmful for health of human beings in the long run. These growing concern of health amongst the people is likely to work in favor of the global fermented plant extracts market over the period of analysis, from 2020 to 2030.

On Oct. 10, the Belmont High girls varsity soccer team played their home opener, against Lexington High School. On Harris Field, both teams fought hard and made the game eventful, yet it still ended in a scoreless tie.
 Senior Night took place at Saturday's game, as a way to honor all of the hard work put in by the class of '21, which includes Ashley Green, Grace Kane, Jenna Thomas, Rachel November, Sadie Kabrhel, Reese Shapazian, Abbie Morin, Kiki Christofori, Katelyn Sawyer, and Lilit Michaelian.
 With assistance from the defense, senior goalie Morin made many incredible saves and didn't let anything go through the posts for the duration of the night. "I think overall we played a really good game on Saturday, even though it was tied at the end", says Grace Kane, one of the five captains for this season. She also mentions that the team "did a much better job of switching the field this game which allowed us to utilize the wings more and overall have more open space."
 Kane gives major credit to the back line, which included Green and Sawyer, as well as Juniors Ally Landry and Cameron Pomer, and Sophomore Sabrina Salls. She said they played an amazing game and did a fantastic job making sure that Lexington's star center forward didn't have much time on the ball.
 Fellow captain, Ashley Green agreed. "I think we did a great job against Lexington," she said post game. "It is definitely different playing the same team back to back, but we handled it very well." The captains emphasized that they used the last game to learn about what tactics would work best for this go round, and switched up formations depending on the situation. Kane mentioned that both formations were successful.
 Overall, the team seemed satisfied after an intense match up against Lexington. They have their sights set on continuing to improve for the rest of the season, as there are still more games left.

The flavor of alcoholic beverages is maintained when it is stored in kegs. As a result, major manufacturers from alcoholic beverages industry are giving preference to use kegs in the storage of their products. Apart from this, kegs are also considered best option for the storage of non-alcoholic beverages. Thus, growing popularity of alcoholic as well as non-alcoholic beverages is indirectly supporting the growth of the global kegs market.

"articleBody": "
 Imagine for a moment it's the year 2025. You're at your desk, reviewing your portfolio.
 Will you be nodding approvingly as you see how well your securities have performed? Or will you be kicking yourself for having chosen a bunch of losers?
 No one can predict the future, of course. But there are ways to improve the odds that on that day in 2025 you'll be feeling quite pleased with yourself.
 One of them is to identify today's secular trends and invest in companies that will ride that wave.
 The term "secular trend" describes market movements that occur over a lengthy period of time. Stocks that are in a secular trend are not seasonal or cyclical; rather they are driven by long-term factors.
 If you pay close attention to secular trends, you can create a stock portfolio that is almost certain to outperform the broad market over time.
 Some of these trends are easy to identify. For example, look at energy. Green energy companies are clearly in an uptrend and there is every reason to expect that to continue. If Joe Biden wins the upcoming U.S. election, he has pledged to spend $1.7 trillion (U.S.) over the next decade on "clean energy and environmental justice," and expects private, state and municipal spending to leverage that to $5 trillion. Even if President Trump, who is skeptical about climate change, is re-elected, the secular trend is already in place.
 Some of the companies that will benefit include Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP.UN-T), Innergex Renewable Energy (INE-T), Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN-T) and Canadian Solar (CISQ-Q).
 For a negative secular trend, look no further than the fossil fuel industry. Our need for oil and natural gas is not going to vanish overnight, but it will steady diminish over time as more green energy options become available. At the time of writing, the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index, which consists almost entirely of fossil fuel companies, was off almost 53 per cent year to date. Some major companies like Suncor (SU-T) and Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ-T) may recover some ground but it is unlikely they will ever retest their all- time highs.
 Another obvious example of a positive secular trend is online shopping. It was already apparent before the pandemic but now it has become an irresistible force. In 2017, online orders accounted for 9.1 per cent of U.S. retail commerce. That increased to 9.9 per cent in 2018. By the fourth quarter of 2019, it was up to 11.3 per cent, according to Statistica. Then came the coronavirus and the chart shot straight up. In the second quarter of this year, online purchases were 16.1 per cent of the total in the U.S. Canadian numbers are likely similar.
 This secular trend will almost certainly continue although the growth rate will likely slow once the pandemic finally passes. Companies that have profited and will continue to do so include Amazon (AMZN-Q), United Parcel Service (UPS-N), FedEx (FDX-N) and Shopify (SHOP-T).
 Some trends are easy to spot but others are more obscure. One example is pet care, which was brought to my attention by my broker. He pointed to the surprising statistics that more U.S. households have pets (84.6 million) than children (52.8 million). Pet owners overwhelmingly regard their animals as "family" and spend $72 billion a year on pet care.
 Companies in this business are thriving, however many of them are not publicly traded or are part of larger corporations like Nestle and Procter & Gamble. One company that is publicly listed is Zoetis (ZTS-N), which was spun out of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (PHE-N) several years ago. It is a global animal health firm that produces medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tests for pets. It generated revenue of $6.3 billion in 2019. As of the time of writing, the stock was up 26 per cent so far this year. The price/earnings ratio is high at 50 but that's not unusual in stocks in a positive secular trend.
 Another secular trend to look at is cybersecurity. With more companies coming under attack, the demand for state-of-the-art firewalls and detection equipment has increased exponentially.
 One leading company we have recommended to readers of my internet Wealth Builder newsletter is Palo Alto Networks (PANW-N), which describes itself as the world's largest cybersecurity company. The California-based firm operates in 75 countries and has more than 75,000 customers. Second-quarter revenue was up 18 per cent year-over-year and the company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.48 for the period. The stock dropped to a low of $125.47 in March but has since rebounded strongly and now trades at about double that figure.
 Other secular trends to watch include robotics, artificial intelligence, electric cars, batteries and health-care infrastructure.
 Let me stress this does not mean all companies in a positive secular trend are going to go straight up in value. There will be bumps along the way. But when you look back at your portfolio in 2025, these will probably be the ones that give you the most satisfaction.

FALL RIVER - Twenty-three years ago when Todd Salpietro opened TJ's Music at 347 South Main St. he knew being a downtown business owner wouldn't necessarily be easy.
 But the thought of an economically crippling coronavirus pandemic never crept into his imagination.
 Salpietro, like countless other business owners, late last March had to close his music store until Gov. Charlie Baker eventually issued an order allowing many non-essential businesses to reopen with social-distancing measures in place.
 "We were closed two and a half months," he said.
 Last month, Salpietro, 48, got a financial assist in the form of a $5,000 grant courtesy of MassDevelopment's Transformative Development Initiative, or TDI for short.
 The Fall River TDI grant program had offered up to $5,000 to qualifying individual businesses or organizations located within what's called the South Main Street Revitalization District.
 Salpietro say he's used the money to pay bills and the salaries of his five nearly full-time employees.
 "We wanted to continue to work," he explained.
 The quasi-public MassDevelopment, originally known as Massachusetts Development Finance Agency, created the TDI program in 2014 -- as a means of enabling "Gateway cities" like Fall River to stimulate economic development and investment in development projects.
 Gateway cities in Massachusetts are defined as "midsize urban centers" with "stubborn social and economic challenges" as well as "many assets with unrealized potential."
 MassDevelopment said it had a grant pool of $90,000 to cover three rounds of pandemic emergency funding, from April to September, for qualifying candidates who applied for the first round of Fall River TDI grants.
 Of the 28 downtown businesses submitting applications 22 qualified for the grants, according to Jim McKeag, who runs and oversees the Fall River TDI from an office inside the One SouthCoast Chamber of Commerce building on Pocasset Street.
 McKeag says individual grants handed out to qualifying candidates ranged from around $750 to the maximum $5,000.
 Other downtown business grant recipients, McKeag said, included Harry's Restaurant, JavaHouse Chew & Brew and the adjacent Drewbi's Salon.
 He said that One SouthCoast Chamber of Commerce -- with offices in Fall River and New Bedford and a membership encompassing 19 municipalities, including Tiverton and Warren, Rhode Island -- has allowed MassDevelopment, at no cost, to utilize space for the city's TDI program inside the chamber's Fall River building.
 McKeag, 50, also says that the Fall River TDI in recent months has been afforded, at no charge, the use of a storefront space at 333 South Main for what's called the VIVA Fall River Pop-Up.
 That space, located near the corner of South Main and Columbia streets, sits between Facchiano's Shoe Repair and TJ's Music.
 The VIVA Fall River Pop-Up, which took its name from a 1983 song by Portuguese singer and songwriter Jorge Ferreira called "Viva Fall River," is used for occasional meetings of downtown business owners to exchange ideas and strategies to advance business development and revitalization.
 The building is owned by John Varao, owner and operator of the adjacent Tax Consultants Inc. at 435 Columbia St.
 "I'd like them to be successful," Varao, 64, said. "That's what we need downtown, some kind of promotion for local business."
 Fall River native Patti Rego, who does marketing and communications for the nonprofit Marion Institute, says the Fall River TDI has had the support of a number of partners -- among them the city of Fall River, local and regional banks and nonprofit organizations and downtown businesses, including Alexandra's Boutique and Fall River Pawnbrokers.
 McKeag says the city's Redevelopment Authority previously contributed $20,000 to the Fall River TDI grant program.
 Rego, 42, also refers to herself as the "chief city cheerleader and content curator" of We Love Fall River -- which is described as "a social movement showcasing positive stories about economic development, community initiatives and arts and culture" within the city.
 Rego says the VIVA Fall River website "will become the central website devoted to promoting Fall River's small businesses, as well as providing resources to these small businesses in the form of education and connection to consumers."
 The website includes a short video featuring the co-owner of JavaHouse Chew & Brew, who says his sales plummeted 95 percent shortly after COVID-19 became known as a national and international health threat.
 He also describes how TDI, Marion Institute and VIVA Fall River put him in touch with downtown food relief programs, so that he could provide free meals to disabled and senior citizens despite his own financial hardship.
 Rego urges businesses within the South Main Street corridor -- that now stretches from City Hall to Union Street -- to apply for future TDI grants.
 She credits MassDevelopment for what she says was its quick action in response to the pandemic.
 "They showed great alacrity, to keep the lights on and help people," Rego said.

Taking to the despatch box, chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was "disappointed" by the MP's tone of voice.
 "It's obviously a very difficult time for many people in this country as we evolve our response to this virus but what we need is a constructive spirit and that is what my honourable friend the community secretary [Robert Jenrick] is trying to do.
 "I hope those conversations are on-going as we speak."
 He said the region was being treated like any other part of our United Kingdom.
 Sunak said national schemes, such as the Job Support Scheme, were in place to provide support to vulnerable people and businesses.
 It comes after Greater Manchester leaders and Downing Street failed to reach a compromise on a new financial aid settlement for the region.
 Downing Street issued regional leaders an ultimatum to accept the government's financial aid package or face being forced into a tier-3 lockdown by midday on Tuesday. That deadline has now passed.
 Great Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has so far resisted calls to impose a tier-3 lockdown without significant financial support and questioned the science behind the move after the government's chief medical adviser professor Chris Whitty said the restrictions did not go far enough to stop the virus.

Speaking on NewsNite on JoyFM, Dr Emmanuel Opoku explained that the activities of these companies will be halted.      “We are going to stop any cocoa, certified or not so long as the company has been identified in this kind of malpractice.
