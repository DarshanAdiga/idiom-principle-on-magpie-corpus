R.G.: The UN system was very slow to get a grip on the scale of the challenge. Even in mid-March, a lot of UN officials in New York didn't seem fully cognizant of how the pandemic was going to change their strategic picture. But Guterres and the UN system as a whole deserve a lot of credit for accelerating their response to the crisis over the last two or three weeks. The Secretary- General's series of statements on the security and socio-economic aspects of the pandemic have shown a degree of foresight that a lot of national leaders have conspicuously failed to offer. And at the working level, I think that UN humanitarian officials, peacemakers and others are now working very hard to find ways to mitigate this mess. There is a sense that UN officials are managing this quite a bit better than the member states, but they ultimately need governments' political and financial support during the crisis.

WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump warned China on Saturday that it should face consequences if it was "knowingly responsible" for the coronavirus pandemic, as he ratcheted up criticism of Beijing over its handling of the outbreak. "It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn't, and the whole world is suffering because of it," Trump told a daily White House briefing.
 It was the latest U.S. volley in a war of words between the world's two biggest economies, showing increased strains in relations at a time when experts say an unprecedented level of cooperation is needed to deal with the coronavirus crisis.
 "If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences," Trump said. He did not elaborate on what actions the United States might take.
 Trump and senior aides have accused China of a lack of transparency after the coronavirus broke out late last year in its city of Wuhan. This week he suspended aid to the World Health Organization accusing it of being "China- centric."
 Washington and Beijing have repeatedly sparred in public over the virus. Trump initially lavished praise on China and his counterpart Xi Jinping for their response. But he and other senior officials have also referred to it as the "Chinese virus" and in recent days have ramped up their rhetoric.
 They have also angrily rejected earlier attempts by some Chinese officials to blame the origin of the virus on the U.S. military.
 Trump's domestic critics say that while China performed badly at the outset and must still come clean on what happened, he is now seeking to use Beijing to help deflect from the shortcomings of his own response and take advantage of growing anti-China sentiment among some voters for his 2020 re-election bid.
 At the same time, however, White House officials are mindful of the potential backlash if tensions get too heated. The United States is heavily reliant on China for personal protection equipment desperately needed by American medical workers, and Trump also wants to keep a hard-won trade deal on track.
 Trump said that until recently the U.S.-China relationship had been good, citing a multi-billion agricultural agreement aimed at defusing a bitter trade war. "But then all of a sudden you hear about this," he said.
 He said the Chinese were "embarrassed" and the question now was whether what happened with the coronavirus was "a mistake that got out of control, or was it done deliberately?"
 "There's a big difference between those two," he said.
 WUHAN LAB
 Trump also raised questions about a Wuhan virology laboratory that Fox News this week reported had likely developed the coronavirus as part of China's effort to demonstrate its capacity to identify and combat viruses. Trump has said his government is seeking to determine whether the virus emanated from a Chinese lab.
 As far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology dismissed rumors that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its labs or perhaps escaped from such a facility.
 Wandering off the topic of the coronavirus, Trump also used the White House briefing to take a swipe at presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his long record on China as a senator and former vice president.
 While stressing his own confrontational trade policies toward China, Trump, using his nickname "Sleepy Joe" for his rival, said if Biden wins the White House that China and other countries "will take our country."
 Trump also again cast doubt on China's death toll, which was revised up on Friday. China said 1,300 people who died of the coronavirus in Wuhan - half the total - were not counted, but dismissed allegations of a cover-up.
 The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 720,000 infections and over 37,000 deaths.
 Even Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force who has steered clear of political aspects of Trump's contentions briefings, questioned China's data.
 Showing on a chart that China's death rate per 100,000 people was far below major European countries and the United States, she called China's numbers "unrealistic" and said it had a "moral obligation" to provide credible information.

The battle between the Israeli Health Ministry and Finance Ministry over the lifting of coronavirus-spurred lockdowns is heated. Early on in the crisis, when schools, malls and office buildings closed last month, government officials projected that life would resume some semblance of normalcy in the immediate aftermath of Passover.  

 It was a mid-April date on which parents pinned hopes and to which everyone looked forward. But to no avail. The kids are still home, stores remain shut and freedom of movement feels like a thing of the distant past.  

 To counter bouts of anxiety, loneliness and cabin fever - amid a rise in COVID-19 deaths and a drop in employment - we Israelis initially turned to humor. Hebrew memes circulating on social media poked fun at the current form of warfare, which involves not charging at the enemy with tanks and rifles, but rather binging on Netflix and junk food.  

 Growing fat is not the only reason that our patience has begun to wear thin, however.  

 ALONGSIDE A general societal willingness to adopt inconvenient habits to contain the ultra-contagious virus that strikes "grandmas and grandpas" with a vengeance, there is a gnawing sense that health authorities are going a bit too far in their doomsday scenarios.
 Defending their demand for increasingly stringent measures to "flatten the coronavirus curve," these authorities often appear oblivious to the ills of a demolished economy and mass demoralization.  

 The perilous side effects are already evident. Indeed, in a matter of weeks, more than a quarter of the workforce suddenly found itself with no income, business owners became poverty-stricken overnight, domestic violence spiked drastically and the ERAN organization hotline for emotional first aid has been ringing off the hook.  

 The argument that the cure for the coronavirus crisis could end up being worse than the disease, then, has genuine merit. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows it, which is why he keeps assuring us that an "exit strategy" is underway to enable the reopening of the economy - beginning, perhaps, as early as Sunday.  

 We will believe it when we see it, of course, since the only movement we have seen of late has been in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the controversy over the health risk continues to rage, in spite of the fact that the rate of infection and hospitalization has decreased, or at least plateaued, depending on the number of COVID-19 tests administered or results received on a given day.
 IN AN interview with Channel 12's Yonit Levi on Wednesday, Health Ministry director-general Moshe Bar Siman-Tov reiterated his consistent stance on the pandemic: it is not behind us. He even went as far as to reject the term "exit strategy," saying we should refer to our current reality as "routine in the shadow of corona."  

 "Corona is still here," he asserted. "Corona is still contagious. We see what's happening in other countries, and we understand that the event is not over. Thus, though we do want to resume economic activity, we will have to behave differently from the way we have been doing until now, to ensure that there isn't another outbreak … Our recommendation, which we will present to the prime minister, is based on the principles of caution and moderation."  

 He did not explain exactly what he meant by this. And though he declined to reveal his opinion about the wisdom of some shops opening next week, his opposition to it was obvious.  

 Former Health Ministry director-general Prof. Gabi Barbash, Channel 12's resident medical expert, was less vague but equally somber. To justify his own reservations on the reopening of the economy, he pointed to countries that "absorbed another hit" of the virus as soon as they resumed regular activities.  

 It was surrounding this very issue of coronavirus management abroad that Barbash butted heads on Monday with Tel Aviv University security studies program director, and prominent mathematician, Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel. Ben- Israel, chair of the National Council for Research and Development said COVID-19 follows a "set pattern" - of peaking after about 40 days and virtually disappearing after 70 - in every afflicted area of the world, including New York. Calling Israel's lockdowns and curfews a function and expression of "mass hysteria" - and saying that simple social distancing is sufficient - he railed against "closing down the entire country when most of the population is not at high risk."  

 Barbash blasted Ben-Israel's theory, claiming Israel is going to be contending with the coronavirus for at least another year. When Ben-Israel concluded his interview and left the studio, an incensed Barbash declared, "I strongly urge that we not let mathematicians, who know nothing about biology, determine when we lift the lockdown."  

 Whether or not Ben-Israel was right, Netanyahu has been erring on the side of caution. So Barbash has nothing to worry about just yet.
 NOR IS the Health Ministry the only body putting the brakes on a return to normal school and work activity. The National Security Council, too, is recommending Netanyahu slow down, rather than speed up, the process. After consulting with health and finance officials, as well as teams of scientists and economists, the NSC formulated an "exit plan" to present to Netanyahu and the Knesset.
 The plan contains four phases, the first of which entails the resumption of activity in the hi-tech, finance and import-export sectors, as well as in public transportation and parts of the education system. The second phase allows for small stores and additional sections of the education system to reopen. In the third phase, hotels, restaurants and cafes will be able to receive patrons. The fourth and final phase will only begin when the pandemic is "under full control." During this stage, the entertainment industry, culture, sports, shopping malls and airlines will resume operations.  

 According to this plan, citizens above the age of 60 and members of other high-risk populations will be excluded from most of the above - even though everybody at all venues will be required to adhere to social-distancing regulations and hygiene procedures.  

 It is not clear how long each phase of this draconian program, if approved, will last. It is likely to take months, with spurts of lockdowns along the way. What it does not answer is the question of how people over 60 with preexisting conditions will get back to work, let alone enjoy any leisure.  

 WHICH BRINGS us back to the bone of contention between the Health Ministry and the Finance Ministry.  

 The latter considers the reopening of the economy to be both urgent and feasible. Finance Ministry officials believe that most people not in high-risk categories can return safely to work without placing too great a burden on the hospitals. Their optimism stems from the fact that original predictions - according to which 10,000 patients would be in need of ventilators by this point - proved false. Astonishingly, at the time of this writing, the number was well below 150.  

 The former nevertheless disagrees. Health Ministry officials hold fast with the notion that the economy should not begin to reopen until the total number of new cases is no higher than 30-50 per day. With such a criterion, which is tantamount to a "no exit" strategy, we will all die of starvation - or obesity - well before contracting COVID-19.  

 Following a marathon meeting on Thursday afternoon with all the relevant ministry and NSC representatives, Netanyahu will weigh the options at his disposal and decide, ostensibly by the end of the weekend, on when to get the country up and running again. For our health, let it be soon.  

 The advice of virologists and epidemiologists has kept us quarantined with good reason. Now it is time to heed the market.

IDF Spokesman Brig.-Gen. Hidai Zilberman recently told reporters that the corona pandemic had hit hard in some of the region's countries and there was "a decline in hostile activity toward Israel." The severe outbreak of the disease in Iran has reduced the volume of its military activity against Israel as regards the supplying of weapons and financing of terrorism.  

 The plague hit Lebanon during an ongoing economic crisis. The dire situation of both countries has had a profound effect on Hezbollah, the terrorist organization that is supported by Iran and which is an integral part of the Lebanese government.  

 In an article published by researchers at the National Security Research Institute, Orna Mizrahi and Yoram Schweitzer state, "In these circumstances there is heightened pressure on Hezbollah, which is responsible for the appointment of the current minister of health."
 Mizrahi and Schweitzer recommended that "the IDF should continue to use the opportunity to strike Hezbollah forces in Syria and disrupt their efforts to bring weapons into Lebanon." The IDF, it seems, agreed with the assessment of the two.  

 According to foreign publications, the Israeli Air Force recently carried out a series of strikes in Syria, some to prevent the organization from obtaining long-range guided missiles, and some against the "Golan File" unit that Hezbollah has established on the Golan Heights.
 An epidemic or not, since the Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah stars at the top of the threat scenarios table prepared by the IDF. The man who worries the most is the commander of the IDF's Northern Command, Maj.-Gen. Amir Baram.  

 Last February, Baram spoke at a conference held in memory of Paratroopers Brigade Reconnaissance ( _Sayeret Tzanhanim_ ) company commander, Maj. Eitan Balachsan, who was killed in a skirmish with Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon in 1999.  

 Baram said at the conference that he and Balachsan "met many times throughout the service in Lebanon, as young commanders in the paratroopers." He was also the man called to take command of the company after its commander was killed.  

 The man who recommended to call him was the commander of the brigade to which Balachsan belonged, along with Baram's company commander when he joined the paratroopers' anti-tank company, Aviv Kochavi (Now the IDF chief of staff).  

 Indeed, despite the severe blow to the company, Baram again made it a leading operational unit. A few months later, Baram led a force from the company in a tangled operation in Lebanon. The result was two Hezbollah operatives killed.  

 The next time Baram was operating in the Lebanese sector was when he commanded the elite Maglan unit (before that he was my battalion commander in the Paratroopers Brigade). Although most of the activity during those years was in Judea and Samaria and Gaza, Baram pushed to activate the unit also against Hezbollah.
 IN JUNE 2005, a force from the unit, commanded by Itamar Ben-Haim, also a Paratroopers Brigade officer (and now commander of the Hebron Brigade), ambushed three Hezbollah operatives on Mount Dov. Ben-Haim's force killed the squad commander who took part, it turned out, in the ambush in which Balachsan was killed. The other two operatives fled, and one was wounded.  

 The death of the squad commander has had a profound effect on Hezbollah's senior command in the area. In an after-action report, Baram wrote, "Hezbollah also has faces and names. It's not a demon that comes out of the ground, for whom the people are also dear. Wounded and dead are extremely difficult for them."  

 Since 2005, the IDF has fought two campaigns against Hezbollah; one in the summer of 2006, and one secret, long and Sisyphean. Former IDF chief of staff Lt.-Gen Gadi Eisenkot described at the time dealing with Hezbollah as "a huge iceberg, some of which is visible to the public and media eye, and the greater part is hidden from view."  

 The prime example is the organization's flagship project: the penetration tunnels dug in the northern border, which the IDF surprisingly destroyed in Operation Northern Shield.  

 At the conference, Baram said that despite the Lebanese government's claims that Hezbollah does not share its decisions, it is "two sides of the same coin."  

 The Lebanese president pledged in an interview to the French media that Hezbollah obeyed UN resolution 1701, which at the time ended the Second Lebanon War and included the deployment of an armed UN and the Lebanese Army in southern Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah from continuing to operate from there.  

 "But what they say in French does not happen on the ground in Arabic," said the Northern Command's general, noting that the organization, sponsored by the Lebanese state, "violently violates the decision."  

 As examples, he brought military activity in Shi'ite villages in southern Lebanon and the organization's striving to equip itself with long-range, high- precision missiles with the aim of damaging the Israeli home front.  

 In his speech, Raman warned, "If we are to fight, we will know how to claim a heavy price from this organization and those who sponsor it; also from its patrons in the northeast, also from the capital of the Lebanese state in Beirut, and certainly from the Shi'ite villages in southern Lebanon, which serve as a shelter and base for Hezbollah's terrorist forces".  

 The IDF, like Israel as a whole, is now facing a pandemic. The 98th Paratroopers Division, commanded by Brig.-Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who had previously commanded the Paratroopers Reconnaissance Battalion in Operation Cast Lead and the Givati ​​Brigade, was deployed to Bnei Brak, as part of an effort to stop the severe outbreak of the epidemic that was discovered in before it can expand into wider circles outside the city.  

 That makes a lot of sense, since it's a flexible and portable power, but the 98th Division is the sharpened tip of the IDF Ground Forces for war. In the next round against Hezbollah, it is a significant tool in the IDF's offensive ability that the commander of the Northern Command spoke of, through rapid, deadly and flexible ground maneuvers at the front and behind enemy lines. In order to be ready for war the day after the coronavirus subsides, the IDF will be required to regain its now-defunct combat capabilities.  

 Hezbollah was at a low level in the past, during difficult times in the Syrian civil war and after the Second Lebanon War. But even when it was down, Hezbollah refused to give up the fight in Israel. Today the IDF is focusing its efforts close to home, investing resources, troops and tools in finding solutions to the plague. But it would be best to look to the future, too, because the plague will finally pass, and Hezbollah is here to stay.

There are several things that can be noted about this pair of definitions. The first is that they are extremely difficult to use as criteria for judging whether any particular institution or agreement should be classified as multilateralist. If state A sets up a traveller inspection arrangement, whether aimed at terrorists or viruses, if state B then adopts most of those measures, while revising some of them, and if state C makes additional modifications, to which A and B respond by amending their original procedures, is this coordination by a group of three states? I assume not, that both Keohane and Ruggie have in mind a forum in which A, B, and C would hash out the rules together; but it’s unclear why this latter is any more coordinative, or has any greater policy significance, than the former.
 However, coordination is much easier to assess than “generalized principles of conduct”, not only because human beings are skilled at dreaming up such principles as a cover for pursuing their own interests but because it’s difficult to be sure what a state’s motivations are for the actions it undertakes. For example, when the US pushed most favoured nation in trade, one of Ruggie’s key principles of multilateralism, was this because it was a generalised principle of conduct or because, believing that trade disputes could lead to wars, US leaders were determined not to get dragged into a third European war several decades down the road? Even more problematically, if there are two or more different principles that could be cited as a basis for coordination, how are we to choose? Did NATO allies’ participation in the 1991 Gulf War reflect a norm of nonaggression, or of collective self-defence?

Turkey's official coronavirus infections rose to more than 86,000 with 2,000 deaths on Monday, making it among the worst affected countries in the region. Iran, which hid its number of cases in February, now has 82,000 and more than 5,000 deaths. Because much of the Middle East is dominated by authoritarian regimes or countries in the midst of conflict, the official counts for the virus in most places are either unclear or likely higher than governments admit.
 Turkey's media, which is almost entirely pro-government with many dissident journalists in prison, has sought to praise the leadership's handling of the pandemic. In early March Daily Sabah claimed the country was virus-free and a model to the world in fighting the virus. Then Turkey pivoted to sending aid abroad to a dozen countries, even as Turkey continued to stoke crises with its neighbors, carrying out airstrikes in Iraq, pushing refugees to enter Greece and fueling extremists in northern Syria. The coronavirus crisis has momentarily taken Turkey's government eyes off of Syria, where it fought a brief conflict with the Syrian regime in late February.
 Why Turkey has become a hotspot of the virus is not entirely clear. It sought to cut off travel to Iran in February when it realized there was a major outbreak in its neighbor. It also sought to bring Turkish citizens back from Europe, where the pandemic was growing.  Likely Turkey was most impacted because it is a major transit for international travel and a tourism destination. IN neighboring Iraq and Syria there are officially very few cases. Syria is divided between regime-controlled areas, Turkish-occupied northern Syria and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in eastern Syria. Because of this it is difficult to carry out virus testing in Syria, even if the regime waned to. However the World Health Organization and international organizations have done almost nothing to make up for the testing gaps in Syria. This means we don't know if some of the Turkish cases may have come from Syria. Turkey and its extremist militia allies in northern Syria have sealed the border and even cut off water to parts of eastern Syria, so that may have stalled the virus spread in some areas or contained it to various provinces.
 Meanwhile Turkey's government has used a complex method of curfews and age restrictions as opposed to a total lockdown, to try to slow the spread of the virus. This has not been successful yet but Ankara believes that its policies are working slowly. In addition it can point to a relatively low number of deaths, compare to Europe, as a success story. Turkey and Germany have a similar population and Germany has more than twice the number of deaths than Turkey and twice the number of cases. Yet Germany is hailed as a success story against the virus.
 The pandemic is one of the only setbacks for Turkey's regime after a series of successes. Turkey has increasingly taken over parts of eastern Syria, forced the US to withdraw from other parts of Syria, sent forces to Iraq, Qatar and Libya to push its foreign military policies, and Turkey is buying S-400 air defense from Russia while playing a leading role in NATO. Ankara has successfully jailed opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents, meaning there is little critique at home for the ruling party which has been in power for most of two decades.

Israeli-based Pluristem has treated its first American patient suffering from COVID-19 complications under the country's compassionate use program.
 The news comes days after a report by the company showed that six critically ill coronavirus patients in Israel who are considered high-risk for mortality were treated with Pluristem's placenta-based cell-therapy product and survived, according to preliminary data provided by the Haifa-based company.
 In the US case, the patient was treated with the company's PLX cell therapy at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey, where Pluristem is already running a Phase III critical limb ischemia study. Like the patients treated in Israel, this patient was critically ill with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated in an intensive care unit for three weeks.
 The company's president and CEO, Yaky Yanay, said that although Pluristem is focused on a planned multinational clinical trial for the treatment of complications associated with coronavirus, it does hope to expand treatment under compassionate use in other countries at the same time.
 Specifically, the US treatment was administered under the US Food and Drug Administration's Single Patient Expanded Access Program, which is part of the US Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program - an emergency program aimed at getting treatments to corona patients as quickly as possible.
 In Israel, the six patients were treated at three different Israeli medical centers for one week, also under a compassionate use program. They were suffering from acute respiratory failure and inflammatory complications associated with COVID-19. Four of the six patients also demonstrated failure of other organ systems, including cardiovascular and kidney failure.
 Not only had all the patients survived one week later, according to Pluristem, but four of them showed improvement in respiratory parameters and three of them are in the advanced stages of weaning from ventilators. Moreover, two of the patients with preexisting medical conditions are showing clinical recovery in addition to the respiratory improvement.
 Shortly after the preliminary data was published, Dr. Jason McCarthy, a senior managing director covering the biotechnology industry at Maxim Group praised Pluristem's efforts: "Pluristem shows the COVID-19 world the first clinical data for stem cells," he wrote. "Pluristem is initially evaluating its cell therapy under compassionate use authorization in Israel and is also the first company to dose COVID-19 patients, as well as produce the first set of early stage data."
 The company's results were described by Yahoo! Finance as "promising to say the least."
 "Weighing in for H.C. Wainwright, analyst Swayampakula Ramakanth calls the early data 'encouraging' and thinks the treatment could drive substantial gains for PSTI," the Yahoo! Finance article reported.
 PSTI is the company's NASDAQ listing.
 Pluristem's PLX cells are "allogeneic mesenchymal-like cells that have immunomodulatory properties," meaning they induce the immune system's natural regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages, the company explained in a previous release. The result could be the reversal of dangerous overactivation of the immune system. This would likely reduce the fatal symptoms of pneumonia and pneumonitis (general inflammation of lung tissue).
 Previous preclinical findings regarding PLX cells revealed significant therapeutic effects in animal studies of pulmonary hypertension, lung fibrosis, acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal injury.  

 "We are pleased with this initial outcome of the compassionate use program and committed to harnessing PLX cells for the benefit of patients and healthcare systems," Yanay said.

All along, however, throughout the thirty-one months of his tenure, Lord Chancellor More grew farther apart from Henry on the king's "great matter." As Chancellor, he never publicly and directly challenged the king, but he made it clear privately, to the king and to the many officials, secular and ecclesiastical, whom Henry recruited to persuade him, that he remained convinced of the validity of the marriage of Henry and Catherine. More also made his position clear by things he did not do, such as his refusal in June of 1530 to sign a letter to the pope, drafted at Henry's instance, and signed by numerous noblemen and clerics, entreating His Holiness to grant Henry's annulment. More was not, however, alone in his opinion; it was shared by many "nobles, lawyers and prelates," which may help to explain why More did not lose his office sooner.21 But Henry kept up the pressure, demanding in early 1531 that the assembled clergy of England grant him the title of "Sole Protector and Supreme Head of the English Church and clergy." The assembly eventually acceded to this demand after long negotiations, with a qualifying clause, _" quantum per legem Dei licet", _or "so far as the law of God permits." More continued throughout 1531 to balance his duties as Chancellor against his personal support of Catherine, going so far as to give speeches before both Houses of Parliament in which he stated that Henry's efforts to annul the royal marriage stemmed not "out of love for some lady" but based on conscience and piety. After this point, More first sought to be released from his duties as a matter of personal health.22 He remained through the summer, however, even as Henry banished Catherine to Kimbolton Castle in July, and into the next year as Cromwell and his allies worked to alienate Henry further from his loyalty to Rome, as there were still many prominent people who shared More's view.23

BERLIN - The editor-in-chief of Germany's largest paper Bild on Thursday launched a full frontal attack on China's communist president Xi Jinping for his regime's failure to come clean about the coronavirus outbreak and the massive human rights violations carried out by the Communist Party.
 Julian Reichelt, the prominent editor-in-chief of the _Bild,_ wrote to Jinping that  "Your embassy in Berlin has addressed me in an open letter because we asked in our newspaper _Bild_ whether China should pay for the massive economic damage the coronavirus is inflicting worldwide."
 He wrote that, "You [Jinping], your government and your scientists had to know long ago that coronavirus is highly infectious, but you left the world in the dark about it. Your top experts didn't respond when Western researchers asked to know what was going on in Wuhan. You were too proud and too nationalistic to tell the truth, which you felt was a national disgrace."
 Reichelt said that, "You rule by surveillance. You wouldn't be president without surveillance. You monitor everything, every citizen, but you refuse to monitor the diseased wet markets in your country. You shut down every newspaper and website that is critical of your rule, but not the stalls where bat soup is sold. You are not only monitoring your people, you are endangering them - and with them, the rest of the world."
 He continued with his bill of particulars, noting that "surveillance is a denial of freedom. And a nation that is not free, is not creative. A nation that is not innovative, does not invent anything. This is why you have made your country the world champion in intellectual property theft.
 "China enriches itself with the inventions of others, instead of inventing on its own," Reichelt wrote. "The reason China does not innovate and invent is that you don't let the young people in your country think freely. China's greatest export hit (that nobody wanted to have, but which has nevertheless gone around the world) is coronavirus."
 The spokeswoman for China's embassy, Tao Lil, published an open letter to _Bild_ in German on the embassy's website on Wednesday, stating that, "I followed your reporting on the corona pandemic in general and China's alleged guilt in particular today. Apart from the fact that we consider it a pretty bad style to blame a country for a pandemic that is affecting the whole world and then to present an explicit account of alleged Chinese debts to Germany, the article ignores some essential facts."
 She added that "We note that many countries now struggling with COVID-19 have had time to prepare for the cross-border spread of the pathogen after China reported its outbreak under IHR [World Health Organization] guidelines."
   
 The best-selling paper Bild calculated prior to Reichelt's editorial that China owed Germany €149 billion for coronavirus damages, triggering the angry response from the Chinese embassy in Berlin.
 Bild said the compensation amounts to  €1,784  per person if Germany's GDP drops by 4.2 percent. The Bild article was titled: "What China owes us."
 China's embassy spokeswoman said the article "stirs up xenophobia and nationalism."
 The _Bild_ editor-in-chief cited a Washington Post article reporting that, "your laboratories in Wuhan have been researching coronaviruses in bats, but without maintaining the highest safety standards. Why are your toxic laboratories not as secure as your prisons for political prisoners? Would you like to explain this to the grieving widows, daughters, sons, husbands, parents of corona victims all over the world?"
 He concluded that, "In your country, your people are whispering about you. Your power is crumbling. You have created an inscrutable, non-transparent China. Before Corona, China was known as a surveillance state. Now, China is known as a surveillance state that infected the world with a deadly disease.That is your political legacy."

Back in early March, owners of retail space were already dealing with tenants whose businesses were struggling even before the orders to close came down. Some stores had to lay off workers or even close down completely because people were voluntarily staying away. Their customers decided to play it safe in a time of uncertainty and stay home. The orders from the governors merely memorialized the actions people were already taking. Yes, there may have been an owner of a nail salon who would have stayed open to handle a customer or two a day that had to close down because the governor of her state ordered it, but the lack of business made it easy to cooperate with those kinds of orders.

 The debt-laden business has come under fire from activist investors in recent years, resulting in a leadership shake-up last year.

 It said it has therefore given each factory worker two additional days of annual leave and a £250 cash bonus.
 The company added: "Volumes have started to reduce from the exceptional levels seen in March, although are still expected to continue to be higher than average patterns of demand.
 "This reflects more meals being eaten at home than usual due to recent measures set out by the Government, and hence increased demand for the group's product ranges."
 It comes on the back of surging supermarket sales over the past month, as shoppers have stocked up on essentials.
 Premier said it now expects to post a trading profit for the year ending March 28 at the "top end of market expectations" following a strong March period.

However, coordination is much easier to assess than “generalized principles of conduct”, not only because human beings are skilled at dreaming up such principles as a cover for pursuing their own interests but because it’s difficult to be sure what a state’s motivations are for the actions it undertakes. For example, when the US pushed most favoured nation in trade, one of Ruggie’s key principles of multilateralism, was this because it was a generalised principle of conduct or because, believing that trade disputes could lead to wars, US leaders were determined not to get dragged into a third European war several decades down the road? Even more problematically, if there are two or more different principles that could be cited as a basis for coordination, how are we to choose?

It is widely recognized that the elderly are most at risk from the novel coronavirus, hence it makes sense to take special efforts to protect them, both for their own sakes and for the sake of the general public.  

 The nightmare scenario has always been that hospitals would be overwhelmed with people requiring ventilators and intensive care treatment and, as happened in Italy and Spain, for example, doctors would be forced to choose which patients to treat, often resulting in the oldest being left to die.  

 Israel, partly because of its relatively young demographic composition, has so far managed to avoid this terrible predicament. But the country is at risk of missing the bigger picture. In many cases, the elderly - not all of them much older than 65 - are being placed in an intolerable situation.  

 Following the relatively large number of deaths among residents of nursing homes, a very strict lockdown has been put in place at most facilities, with soldiers guarding the gates to monitor who enters and leaves. While the reasons for these precautions are clear - including to the residents - the results can be devastating.  

 In many cases, families that have been the major support of parents and grandparents suffering from cognitive impairment can no longer see their loved ones. Some of these elderly residents do not understand why this is happening. Particularly distressing was the report of the plan to remove Alzheimer's sufferers, many of them Holocaust survivors, from their facility in Rishon Lezion, to prepare it to be used as an isolation center for corona patients if necessary. One set of patients should not be sacrificed for the sake of another. That is a basic precept of the Hippocratic oath.  

 The report over the weekend that patients from nursing homes were incorrectly diagnosed as suffering from COVID-19 and hospitalized in special wards also points to an extremely worrying chain of events.  

 The elderly everywhere are suffering from isolation and its devastating consequences. Those who are used to seeing children and grandchildren are being distanced, and those without close families are more alone and lonely than ever. Using platforms such as Zoom is not necessarily a viable alternative. The over-70s are not a homogeneous group; some are comfortable using social media, others are not, and still more might be able to use such media if someone is available to teach them.  

 Locking residents of retirement homes in their buildings - and in some cases in their rooms - is not a reasonable solution, certainly not in the long term. People need social, physical and mental activities in some form, be it in a central hall, respecting the two-meter distance regulation and wearing masks, or using a central courtyard that can be seen from balconies.  

 Not so long ago, the entire Western world followed with interest and empathy the fates of those passengers locked into cabins on cruise ships. Now, an entire segment of the population - a particularly vulnerable sector that often is without a voice - is undergoing something similar, unable to leave the confines of their rooms, with meals being left outside the door and without human contact. This is hard enough for a two-week quarantine, but it is not acceptable for a sustained period.  

 There has been a heartwarming effort to provide food and supplies to the suddenly confined needy but the time has come to think of how to relieve the stress and anxiety and feeling of abandonment.  

 There needs to be broad testing within retirement homes to monitor the situation and prevent these facilities frome accidentally becoming petri dishes of disease.  

 Last year, KAN 11 broadcast a touching series called 80 Plus Four, which documented the mutual benefits when a retirement home hosted a kindergarten for a few weeks. Obviously, now is not the time to introduce even low-risk kindergarten kids into retirement homes, but the authorities should now be thinking of the morning after for the country's oldest age group.  

 Elderly people need a reason to get up in the morning, and to know that they have a tomorrow.

HOLLAND -- Canvas Innovations in Holland is not an essential business under Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-home order, but the boat canvas and upholstery businesses is using its machines to cut material for face masks.
   
 "It was really just recognizing that there is a need and there is a gap, and we could get creative with finding a solution," said Canvas Innovations Owner Chris Ritsema.
   
 Ritsema is partnering with Anchor Rock Foundation, the nonprofit division of Anchor Rock Services Inc. in Holland on a coordinated mask-making effort. A website is expected to be launched Monday for people to learn more about the project and find ways to get involved.
      
 The masks are being made out of washable, high-tech material. Fabric pieces will be cut at Canvas Innovations, then shipped to seamstresses that will follow a pattern to assemble and sew the masks.
   
 Completed masks will then be donated to local health care facilities with a focus on providing masks to health care staff at assisted living centers and hospice workers. Personal protection equipment for healthcare and other essential workers is in short supply due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Currently there is one sewer working at Canvas Innovations making mask prototypes, but Ritsema plans to engage the community in the project. The distribution process will likely be based in a local church, but masks will mostly be sewn at seamstress' homes.
   
 Seamstresses who volunteer will first be shipped a kit with material to make 10 masks. The first mask they make they will be able to wear, Ritsema said. They will send the finished masks back in to be inspected before they will be able to request kits with larger quantities of mask parts.
   
 "We're hoping this is covered through donations and volunteers," said Brian Banks, president of Anchor Rock Services Inc. "We want to do it for free."
   
 The masks will not provide equal protection when compared to N-95 masks, Banks said, but they provide multiple layers of protection with a higher quality material than cotton.
   
 Canvas Innovations is able to efficiently cut thousands of mask pieces with its equipment, Ritsema explained. If they are able to source enough material and get enough volunteers, Ritsema hopes they can assemble 40,000 masks to donate.
   
 "The biggest part of this machine, it's really going to work by getting as many volunteers as we can," he said.
   
 Anchor Rock Foundation plays an important part in the process, Ritsema said, by managing donations and administrative aspects of the project.
   
 The foundation recently launched as the charitable arm of Anchor Rock Services, Inc., said Banks, and this will be its first major project.
   
 "We can still get creative, and can still identify a need and transition and redirect efforts," Banks said. "We're not sitting about and being idle."

“I was all for shutting everything down for a while, to see how things turned out,” said Murphy. “We are getting to a point where May is going to roll around and honestly we’d love to get people back to work.”
 Far Corner Golf Club, which is in Boxford near the North Andover and Bradford town lines, was open in early March of this year and closed when Gov. Baker made his stay-at-home orders on March 23.
 “We’re just hoping we can open soon and abiding by the rules, waiting for their decision,” said long-time Far Corner head pro John O’Connor. “We’d be ready to go whenever we get the word. The weather has been pretty good this spring, much better than last year. We’d definitely be open if we were able to.”
 Merrimack Valley Golf Club in Methuen had been adhering to self-imposed restrictions in mid-March when the course opened. Only one person was allowed per cart, unless they were family members. Masks and gloves were worn when paying in the pro shop, one at a time, said owner George Kattar.
 “We understand that public health is the most important issue,” said Kattar. “But we can do this. Golf is an outdoor sport. We can have rules where nobody touches the flag. And everyone touches only their ball. The restaurant wouldn’t be open, but that’s OK for now.
 “We just think it’s time to let people get out of their houses and relieve some stress,” said Kattar. “Golf can help do that.”
 One unintended benefit through this virus and closed courses has been the conditions of the local courses.
 According to the pros and owners, they have never been better.
 “The good thing is people have been working on courses, as essential workers, and from what I’m hearing they’re all in great shape,” said Murphy. “Honestly, as soon as we get the word, golfers are going to see their courses in great condition. I’m hoping they come back in full force.”
 Atkinson Country Club’s Director of Golf, Pete Doherty, who has been the lone worker in the golf shop as several employees were furloughed in March, hopes the decision to open up courses, with obvious restrictions, would be the right decision.
 And he hopes that Gov. Baker and Gov. Sununu, as well as the governors from Maine and Vermont, are all on the same page for the startup date.
 “You would have way, way more potential contacting amongst people at grocery stores and places like Home Depot or Lowe’s,” said Doherty. “I also hope that the governors work together on this for our sport. If we were open and Massachusetts wasn’t, or the other way around, residents would go over state lines. We need to stay together. Getting some exercise, getting away from the house, and playing golf can help.”

Undeterred, Janice decided to book a night at the Melia Yangon, but because it was after midnight she wasn't able to make a booking online. Instead, she went directly to the hotel and used a trick she'd learned in her travels. "When you book in person, always negotiate a free breakfast," she explained, "and be persistent if they say it's not possible." In this case, the front desk staff initially refused her request, but after letting them know she'd happily take her business down the road to a different property, they bundled the breakfast into the rate. "It was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had, especially the wonderful breads," she recalled.

"There's an application that they fill out, but for most companies that have an HR director or HR manager, it shouldn't be that difficult," said Preston.
 The benefits are obvious. Companies hold on to trained workers, the state pays out less money in public assistance, and recovery arrives early once we turn the corner.
 "I would tell employees as well as the employers. If you don't think your employer is aware of it, point it out to them," he said.  
 Preston also had an update for all those 1099 employees hoping to get unemployment insurance for the first time through the CARES Act passed by Congress. He said the system is still being built to handle those new applicants and it won't be ready until at least the end of April.

Three animal herders, including 1 with a mental health condition, were arrested at a watering hole in sector 8. “The army suddenly showed up in 3 vehicles and 7 motorcycles,” said a herder who managed to hide. “There were 3 adult men there with their animals. They tried to show their IDs but one of the soldiers said, ‘We don't want your IDs, it’s you we want.’ They tied their hands with their turbans, ordered them onto a pickup, and drove off.”

As mentioned by Cohen, many camps are offering their participants an opportunity to virtually connect with their campmates and group leaders for community activities.
 Enrollment meanwhile continues, with most programs committing, as Ramah does, to offer a full refund in case camp ends up being canceled.
 If Cohen suggests that if the summer programs do indeed take place they might be among the most attended ever, considering the deep need for children to spend time outdoors and with friends, the question of financial survival if this does not happen is one of the most pressing.
 According to the FJC report, tuition represents by far the largest component in camp revenues - 76% on average - with average gross revenue of over $2.1 million per year.
 "We have been doing a lot of work with major foundations supporting Jewish life and our key donors, as well as cutting spending as much as we could," the rabbi pointed out, adding that with about a 30-day notice, they will be able to make sure that the programs can run.
 Cohen further said that in monitoring the situations and making arrangements he keeps in constant communication not only with the whole Ramah network, but with leaders of other camps as well, to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
 He highlighted that some medical experts have suggested that such young and isolated communities could represent one of the safest environments from the virus, because even assuming that someone was infected, it would be unlikely that anyone would suffer severe symptoms, but caution is still needed.
 In a document describing the Framework for Reopening America by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention obtained by The Washington Post, the reopening of summer camps, together with schools and daycares, is explicitly mentioned as a priority to allow the country to go back to work.
 The report added that the plan has been discussed with the White House itself as well as other governmental agencies which have been working on similar strategies.
 May 1 could mark the beginning of the partial lifting of the restrictions, at least in the areas less affected by the virus. Some further information on the destiny of 2020 summer camps could be available in a couple of weeks.
 "These are unprecedented times, people are losing jobs, some are getting sick, some are dying. We have to keep summer camps in perspective. They are a wonderful part of life but not the most important thing right now. On the other hand, for families whose children look at camp as this incredible highlight experience in their lives, now more than ever it is important that we do everything possible to open. We are not going to cancel if we don't have too," Cohen concluded.

What remains unclear is whether this emerging plan can succeed without the backing of the federal government. Some states such as Massachusetts and Utah are already trying to implement parts of it. In the absence of federal leadership — as happened last month with stay-at-home orders — other states may watch and follow suit. But without substantial federal funding, states’ efforts will only go so far.

North Little Rock got in just two games before the Arkansas Activities Association implemented a dead period for spring sports before ultimately canceling the remainder of the season on April 9.
 "I was just so disappointed," McMahan said. "We started out so strong playing and I knew that we were going to big things this season and to know that it was unknown, it made me so upset."
 Some of the her best memories have come in a Lady Wildcats uniform, especially the state semifinals against Bryant during her freshman year.
 "The semifinals that we played in was against Bryant and they already beat us twice that year so we were kind of the underdog and beating them to go to the finals was the best feeling."
 Katelyn will continue playing softball in college, going just up the road to Conway to join the Bears program at Central Arkansas.
 "It's really close to home," McMahan said of why she chose to commit to UCA. "The coaching staff is a really good fit for me and I really love the campus. It's very homey."
 While there, McMahan plans to study psychology, while hopes of becoming a sports psychologist.
 "Dealing with sports you learn a lot about the psychology aspect," she said. "So I'd like to go that direction and help other athletes with that part."
