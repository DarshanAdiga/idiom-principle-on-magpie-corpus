This is mainly attributed to continuously changing retail pattern and lifestyle of people in China and South-East Asia.

4\. There are also migrant workers who were not paid their wages, or subjected to verbal and physical abuse or other forms of labour rights violations. They would have left their employers to find other sources of income and thereby become undocumented. It can be argued, correctly, that these workers should have filed their complaints with the Labour Department, which some of them do, usually with assistance of NGOs. But by and large, the migrant DW is quite unaware of the avenues available for them to seek redress, and so they simply go elsewhere to earn a living. While it may not be a legally acceptable excuse, surely these are mitigating circumstances in their favour which would at least warrant an investigation by the Immigration authorites or Labour Department. These workers should also be paid their outstanding wages before they are sent back.

HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — I know we're meant to be washing our hands frequently. We're trying. But we're running out of water again and I don't know when the water truck is going to be back. Queuing and crowding for food was a daily chore even before the coronavirus. It's worse now. Social distancing is a luxury. Our economy is broken. Only Nicolas Maduro's Venezuela has a higher inflation rate than us. We've had critical shortages of water, food, gas, cash. We thought things couldn't get worse. The virus saw to that. Water is my biggest concern. It's usually delivered on a truck by a private company. The municipal water system has been dilapidated for years. We might get municipal water out of a tap at home once or twice a week if we strike it lucky. Mostly, when I turn on a tap it gurgles, spurts some muddy-colored liquid for a few seconds, then stops. My kids won't be washing their hands in that. Jeffrey is my water guy. My delivery time is Friday afternoons. I pay Jeffrey, he pumps 5,000 liters from the tanks on his truck into the one I installed at my house and we're good for another week. Jeffrey doesn't arrive every Friday now. The trucks are being stopped at lockdown roadblocks. When Jeffrey doesn't show, I go to Plan B. A friend has a borehole to access groundwater in his yard. I call him and go round.

2\. There are hundreds of thousands of undocumented MW  who are victims of “Rehiring programmes” with names such 6P, 3P, 3P+1 during which the MWs lost thousands of their hard earned or borrowed money (usually between RM4,000 and RM7,000) and lost their passports to boot. The beneficiaries of these programmes are usually officially appointed agencies and their subagents. A substantial amount of the monies paid by the MWs has also gone to government coffers. When the MWs make police reports against the agents, they are almost always told that it is a commercial crime which the victims have to pursue through civil claims. It is difficult to believe that the immigration authorities are unaware of the cheating that has been going on by their official agents, or at least, through misusing the name of the Immigration Department. This criminal neglect on the part of the authorities and/or their officers, to take any action, while benefitting from these nefarious activities has contributed to the growth in the numbers of undocumented MWs. Can we now say with a straight face and a clear conscience that they are criminals and should be dealt with accordingly?

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate panel is considering Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe’s nomination for director of national intelligence, holding the in-person hearing amid President Donald Trump’s shakeup of the intelligence community and under drastic new distancing rules to protect Capitol Hill from the coronavirus.Ratcliffe's confirmation hearing in the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday comes nine months after Trump first submitted and then abruptly withdrew the three-term lawmaker's nomination. The August withdrawal came after bipartisan Senate criticism that Ratcliffe, one of the president's most ardent defenders during the Russia investigations and Trump's impeachment, was unqualified to oversee 17 U.S. spy agencies.Trump unexpectedly renominated Ratcliffe in February, and his chances at securing the job appear far better, though confirmation is still not guaranteed.Tuesday's hearing will be a test of the Senate's ability to conduct business safely with coronavirus cases still on the rise in the Washington area. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called his chamber back to work Monday, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., kept the House away, saying she had been advised by the Capitol physician that it was not yet safe to convene.The intelligence panel's hearing, along with others this week, was scheduled in one of the Senate's largest meeting rooms, with precautions taken to ensure senators remained far apart during questioning. The public is still barred from the Capitol.Ratcliffe's confirmation hearing has placed a renewed focus on the intelligence community, which has repeatedly warned this year that Russia is trying anew to interfere in the presidential race.The questioning is expected to be contentious, with Democrats decrying what they say is Trump's politicization of the intelligence agencies and his tendency to nominate officials who are loyal to him, regardless of expertise."Nowhere is the need for competent, apolitical leadership clearer than in the position of the Director of National Intelligence," said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, in a statement ahead of the hearing. "Unfortunately, what we have seen from the president, ever since he came into office, is an unrelenting and undeserved political attack upon the professional women and men of our intelligence agencies."Warner said he was willing to give Ratcliffe the benefit of the doubt, but added, "I don't see what has changed since last summer," when his nomination was withdrawn.Since then, Trump installed loyalist Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, as acting director and continued his shakeup of the intelligence community. At least six intelligence officials have been fired, ousted or moved aside since Dan Coats left the DNI post last summer. That includes the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who first revealed a whistleblower complaint last fall that led to Trump's impeachment.Lawmakers are concerned about the turnover and have said they are eager for a permanent, Senate-confirmed replacement for Coats, who had won bipartisan acclaim. Some senators who previously seemed cool on Ratcliffe's nomination appeared to soften.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a critical GOP swing vote on the panel, pointedly said last summer that she had never heard of Ratcliffe before he was nominated. But last week she said that she had spoken with him and concluded that he does have the experience "to meet the statutory standard" for the position."His knowledge of cybersecurity is particularly important given the challenges our country faces," said Collins, who is in a tough re-election race this year. She added that she pressed Ratcliffe to "deliver objective analysis, regardless of the president's views on an intelligence issue."The Maine Republican's supportive statement indicates that Ratcliffe could be easily approved by the panel and then confirmed on the floor. But he will first have to face rigorous questioning at the hearing, including from Republicans, on his thoughts on Atkinson's dismissal and on the work of the U.S. intelligence community, which Trump has repeatedly and openly criticized.He will also be questioned on his experience and his resume, after news reports last year suggested that he had embellished some of his accomplishments as a federal prosecutor. Before being elected to Congress in 2014, Ratcliffe was mayor of Heath, Texas, and a U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas.Ratcliffe, who sits on the House intelligence, judiciary and ethics committees, has been a fierce defender of the president. He forcefully questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller last summer when he testified about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.He was also a member of Trump's impeachment advisory team last fall and aggressively questioned witnesses during House impeachment hearings.After the Democratic- controlled House voted to impeach Trump, Ratcliffe said, "This is the thinnest, fastest and weakest impeachment our country has ever seen."___Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) — Three Norwegian Cruise Line ships have docked at a Virginia port with minimal crews on board during the cruise industry’s voluntary suspension of U.S. operations amid the coronavirus pandemic. The ships parked at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal this week to restock supplies and service their systems, and will remain through at least the end of June, according to Port of Virginia officials. The ships have not had passengers since March 24, and each has fewer than 200 crew members — a fraction of their normal crews, news outlets quoted officials as saying. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regulations mandate the crew members remain on the ships for the entire time they are at the port, according to a statement from the terminal. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will enforce the requirement, allowing for some exceptions approved by the CDC, the statement said. Officials said the cruise line is paying the port a fee to dock each ship and is covering any costs incurred during their stays.

Mumbai, May 5 (PTI) The Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to file a reply clarifying its stand on bearing the travel expenses and cost of medical screening of migrant workers who wished to return to their hometowns amid the coronavirus-enforced lockdown.
 Justice SC Gupte directed the state to file the reply by May 8.
 The court was hearing three Public Interest Litigations filed by several non- government organisations seeking free travel for home state-bound migrant workers, and also some food security, sanitation facilities, among others, to vulnerable sections in light of the COVID 19 pandemic.
 The pleas, filed through lawyers Gayatri Singh, Kranti LC and Ronita Bector, sought that the state must provide necessary relief measures for migrant workers, slum-dwellers, and homeless persons in Maharashtra.
 On Tuesday, the petitioners argued that in light of the offer made by the Congress of bearing transport costs for migrants wishing to return home, and the Centre's assurance of bearing 85 per cent of such cost, and directing the state to bear the remaining, the Maharashtra government must pay for train, bus, or local transport fares for its migrant workers.
 We also sought that the state must pay for the medical check-up and screening for COVID 19 for all such migrant workers that need to be cleared for travel to their hometowns," said advocate Ronita Bector, one of the counsels for the petitioners.
 The states counsel, advocate Bhupesh Samant, sought time to bring the states stand on the issue on record, at which, Justice Gupte directed that the reply be filed by May 8.
 The petitioners also pointed out that the state government was not providing adequate food supplies, medical equipment, sanitation facilities in the slum areas in the city despite its own guidelines recommending that all slum- dwellers be provided with the same.
 At this, the judge said that the state must scrupulously implement its own guidelines on providing relief measures to migrants, slum-dwellers and the homeless.
 The petitions seeking monetary aid and relief for migrant workers have been filed by NGOs Sarva Hara Jan Andolan and Angmehnati Kashtakari Sangharsh Samiti.
 The pleas on food and sanitation facilities have been filed by NGOs Movement for Peace and Justice Welfare and Shramik Mukti Sangathan.

Now, residents and patients are screened for symptoms three times a day while all staff members are also checked and have their temperatures taken upon entering the building, Feifer said, noting that the center's employees have been wearing full personal protective equipment since March 26. Additionally, visits have been largely restricted to what Feifer described as "exceptional circumstances, such as end-of-life situations." In the meantime, he said the center has set up video conferencing for residents and their families.
 Still, family members told the Globe that they remain concerned about the safety of their loved ones.
 Reyita Ramos said her 94-year-old mother, who has been a resident of the nursing home for four years, recently tested positive for coronavirus. Ramos has asked for protective gear to be donated to the care facility, the Globe reported.
 "My heart goes out to these people and I just want them to get all the support they can get," Ramos told the Globe. "I feel like my mom and those residents deserve it because we are not out of the woods, not with this virus."
 In an effort to help elder care centers struggling to contain the spread of the virus, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) announced on April 27 that the state will spend up to $130 million on nursing facilities over the next two months. The funding is intended to support staffing costs, infection control and personal protective equipment, according to a news release from the governor's office.
 In Monday's statement, Feifer pledged that the Medford facility and its administrators "are working around the clock to keep our patients and residents healthy and as safe as possible."
 "We are doing everything in our power — and everything medical experts know as of at this time — to protect our patients, residents and employees," he said.

Raazi has 3 main songs composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy but those 3 songs are enough to overwhelm you with emotions. First up, we get to hear Dilbaro, the farewell song that is played when Sehmat aka Alia is married off to Iqbal Syed (Vicky) and is leaving her parents, Hidayat Khan and Teji Khan. The song’s lyrics and the music is so touching that it is bound to leave you teary-eyed. Next up, we get to hear Raazi’s title track when Sehmat is being trained as a spy by Khalid Mir (Ahlawat). The song showcases Sehmat’s journey of being transformed from an ordinary Kashmiri girl into a RAW agent. The tune of it is bound to get stuck in your head and Arijit Singh’s vocals will win you over. However, the best song comes as the last in the film and it is Ae Watan. There are two versions of the song, one in Sunidhi Chauhan’s voice and one in Arijit Singh’s voice. However, it is this song that will swell up your chest with pride about your motherland. No matter how many challenges our country might be facing, the song is about celebrating it anyway. All the 3 songs are surely going to get stuck in your head!
