"The measure drew strong opposition from the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police and the Illinois Sheriffs' Association, which sent a letter to the governor and lawmakers warning the proposal would not stop medical marijuana card holders from driving while under the influence. They suggested blood and urine testing be included in the legislation to allow police to determine whether card holders had marijuana in their system while driving."

The Print said that the app developed by the IIT-Kharagpur grad only facilitated the customers in buying tickets quickly on IRCTC’s platform. “One might think Indian Railways would be on board with this innovation, especially since the enhanced user experience on the margin likely contributes to greater ticket throughput (and hence greater revenue). Nope, no such luck,” the report added.

A 55-year-old woman suffered injuries that were considered life-threatening early Monday in a fire at a southwest Topeka apartment.
   
 The Topeka Fire Department wasn't releasing the name of the woman, whom it said was taken by American Medical Response ambulance to a Topeka hospital.
   
 The fire's cause hadn't been determined and remained under investigation, said Topeka Fire Marshal Todd Harrison.
   
 He said firefighters were called just before 1:30 a.m. Monday to 2925 S.W. Maupin Lane, Apt. 105, where they arrived to find the fire was already out. Maupin Lane runs north and south and is located about six blocks east of S.W. Wanamaker Road.
   
 Damages were estimated at $100, with all of those being to the contents of the apartment, Harrison said.
   
 No working smoke detectors were found in the apartment, he said.
   
 Firefighters were assisted at the scene by AMR, Kansas Gas Service and Evergy, Harrison said.
   
 He asked anyone with information about the circumstances of the fire to call Crime Stoppers at 785-234-0007 or toll-free at 800-222-TIPS (8477).

When the champions of the Turkish Super Lig are crowned each year, the people of Istanbul certainly know about it.
 Car horns blare across the city, and partying supporters fill the streets with the yellow and blue of Fenerbahce, the red and gold of Galatasaray or the black and white of Besiktas. After all, other than Bursaspor in 2010, Istanbul's "Big Three" have won every Turkish championship since 1984.
 This year, however, the sprawling metropolis that straddles the Bosphorus on the border between Europe and Asia was a lot quieter — and not just because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 In the western suburb of Basaksehir, far from the labyrinthine mazes of the old town, the open-top bus carrying the Istanbul Basaksehir players sped serenely down wide, newly built boulevards, cheered at irregular intervals by fans wearing orange and blue. They had just lost 3-2 away to Kasimpasa on the final day, July 26, but it didn't matter; they had wrapped up the Super Lig title a week earlier, the first in the club's short history.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Control of the Senate is at stake. Republicans are fighting in Tuesday's election to retain their majority against a surge of Democratic challengers across a vast political map in states once considered long shots for Democrats. It’s not just senators on the ballot but also Washington’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation's uneasy mood. The outcome may not be known on election night. With Republicans now controlling the chamber 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency. The vice president can break a tie.
