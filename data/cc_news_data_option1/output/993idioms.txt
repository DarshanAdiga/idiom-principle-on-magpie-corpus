Though bullied by many, we’re not defeated. Though our way is blocked, there’s an exit. Though pursued by the enemy, God defends us. Though overthrown by body blows, we’re not overcome. And in a final image from Paul, we die to self but rise again until our lifework is finished.

"You've never had a game like that before ever in your life," Gausman said. "You know, you go to a T-ball game and your parents are there. There's somebody there, whether it's a stranger walking by a ball field or something, there's always somebody there. So it was pretty weird that it was the big leagues and there was nobody there."

I love a good “wandering in the wilderness” story. The protagonist is passionate and ready to venture forth – to not only survive but also to thrive. The hero suffers during the quest. He or she perseveres through thick and thin to overcome giant obstacles and accomplish a noble cause. The cause will be bigger than one person’s gain; a true hero provides for one and all a path that breaks through to the other side.
 Such epic elements animate the Bible’s story of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt. He leads them through the wilderness – and after 40 years to the Promised Land. It took that long in the wilderness because they tended to forget about God. Moses could take the people out of Egypt – though it took 10 plagues and a mad dash through the Red Sea – but he could not take Egypt out of the people. God was not pleased with their idolatry – nor ours. Yet He provides a “way of escape when temptation is too great to bear,” as in 1 Corinthians 10:13.

Green only plays the corner infield positions, but it's still unclear who the Giants view as third baseman Evan Longoria's primary backup. Minor league free-agent Pablo Sandoval likely won't be ready to play the field regularly by the end of the spring as he continues his recovery from Tommy John surgery, so Green could be the next most viable option.

Through winds of trial and storms of temptation we grow strong, extend deeper roots of faith and live on a more-exalted level. Ours is a wilderness faith – wilderness born and bred, pure and simple. How we ultimately fare depends on whether we heed God’s warnings regarding the wilderness – and if we follow the example of Jesus. Remember God is with us. We will not face testing beyond what we can endure.
 Not all who wander in Wilderness are lost. The Israelites were lost; Jesus was not. What about you?

JEFFERSON CITY — No political intent. No conspiracy theory behind requiring Democratic State Auditor Nichole Galloway — who is running for governor — to have her office independently audited, as soon as possible.
 That's what Missouri Sen. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, underscored repeatedly during a 10-minute hearing on Senate Bill 927, sponsored by Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan.
 "I don’t have any plan because of any sort of conspiracy theory," Rowden said. He said the committee discussing the bill wants to "make sure that it is done as expeditiously as possible as to not make this political, which we have no intention."
 The bill would employ an independent certified public accountant to conduct an audit of the State Auditor's Office before the end of the 2020 calendar year. Galloway is expected to be the Democratic Party's nominee to challenge Republican Gov. Mike Parson in the Nov. 3 election.
 Rowden said it is the statutory requirement that the office be audited independently every two years, which hasn't been done since 2017.
 Current law mandates the office be audited by an independent party during the regular legislative session convened in "an odd-numbered year."
 Galloway, who's been the state auditor since April 2015, issued a statement Monday in response to the bill.
 The statement reads: "During my time as State Auditor, my office has been independently audited and peer reviewed by professional auditors five times. Three of these audits were performed at the request of the General Assembly. Each time these reviews found that my office operates efficiently, effectively, and in compliance with professional auditing standards."
 Rowden wanted to have the auditor's office audited during the 2019 legislative session through Senate Concurrent Resolution 10, but the resolution didn't get approved by the House.
 “This should have already happened, and I think at least a fair amount of blame lies on the House," he said. "And I am OK with saying that.”
 House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, wasn't available for comment.
 Sens. Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, and John Rizzo, D-Kansas City, said the previous audits have proven that Galloway's office has been running in a transparent fashion.
 "I just hope that nobody's trying to make a political football out of it," said Rizzo, who is the Senate Minority Floor Leader.
 SB 927 contains an emergency clause, which means the bill would take effect immediately upon its signature into law.

A wilderness is where authentic faith is born and bred. God promised to lead the people under Moses through the wilderness “to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands,” says Deuteronomy 8:2. God’s warnings to the wandering Hebrew people were recorded for our benefit today. Inner character, saving faith and hope in God develop through the struggles and adversity of a wilderness, says the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 10.
