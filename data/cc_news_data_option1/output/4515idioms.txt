The judge on Thursday overruled objections by attorneys representing 11 women who oppose the settlement.

 "We are a freedom-loving people and not vengeful," the 52-year-old Thaci said at a news conference in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. "That is why no claim may rewrite history. Kosovo has been the victim. Serbia has been the aggressor."

By Chapin Jewell       Tribune Correspondent       MINERAL COUNTY - The news everyone feared might be coming broke at 10:17 a.m. on Wednesday in the form of a media advisory from Mineral County Schools.  "Mineral County Schools and the Mineral County Health Department have received confirmation this morning of our district being designated as RED on the daily DHHR County Alert System. The RED designation will immediately impact in-person learning and extra-curricular activities."       With this announcement, any chance of the highly anticipated 2020 Mineral Bowl between host 7-1 Frankfort and 7-2 Keyser was killed. With a steady, if not dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Mineral County on the rise for a week, the news, though unwelcomed, really wasn't a surprise.         Nonetheless, it stings. It stings for two communities at opposite ends of Mineral County eagerly anticipating what by all indications was going to be a spectacular matchup of two very solid and accomplished teams. It stings for the coaches who have put so much time and energy into making their teams the best they can be. Most importantly, of course, it stings for the kids, who will forever wonder what might have been had the game been played.       Let's be clear, the designation of RED not only ended the Mineral Bowl, but also in-person instruction, and with respect to sports, it affects volleyball, and it affects cheerleading, both of which had post-season activities scheduled for the week.       In football, the Mineral Bowl would have been a clash of two highly ranked West Virginia class AA teams. In the latest WVSSAC class AA playoff ratings released on Tuesday, the 7-1 Frankfort Falcons were rated third in class AA, and the 7-2 Keyser Golden Tornado were rated sixth. In the opinion-based WVMetroNews Power Rankings, in class AA, Frankfort was ranked fourth and Keyser eighth.       Frankfort, in compiling their 7-1 record, earned victories over Hampshire (46-0), Weir (36-27), Berkeley Springs (41-0), Spring Mills (21-20), Jefferson (28-19), Petersburg (42-20), North Marion (36-19). The Falcons' lone defeat was at Washington by a score of 20-19 in a game in which Frankfort had a chance to win the game with a field goal at the buzzer that was blocked. Frankfort's scheduled week nine contest against Oak Glen was cancelled for COVID-related issues, and now, so too has been the Mineral Bowl contest with Keyser.       The Falcons have accumulated 270 points through eight games and yielded only 124. This results in an average score per game of 34-16 in favor of Frankfort.         Keyser, in compiling their 7-2 record, earned victories over Berkeley Springs (61-33), Washington (55-35), Nicholas County (70-19), Hampshire (54-0), Jefferson (63-44), Petersburg (62-26), John Marshall (53-21). The Golden Tornado suffered losses at Oak Glen (35-12) and Point Pleasant (38-28). The only game cancelled for Keyser this season was today's scheduled Mineral Bowl.       The Black and Gold have accumulated 458 points through nine games and yielded 251. This results in an average score per game of 51-28 in favor of Keyser. Keyser's 458 points scored is the most by any team in the entire state of West Virginia, regardless of class.         By all accounts, the expectation was that the Mineral Bowl would have been a hotly contested battle between two excellent squads. While it's looked forward to every year, there was definitely some added excitement this year with both teams posting quality results week after week, not to mention the very high rankings enjoyed by most.       While there was a sense by both coaches early on that the season might not happen at all, or that if it did, once started, it would quickly come to an end, making it this far, while a blessing, makes it worse when the carpet is now pulled out from under them.       "I really didn't think it would get this far, but after we got rolling and got so many games in, you start thinking wow, maybe this thing will last until the end of the season. I'm kind of shocked really, that it got to this point, because once we got rolling, I didn't think this point would come to where we would turn Red and not be able to play. It's definitely a kick in the guts and a horrible feeling, I'm really struggling with it for the kids," Frankfort coach Kevin Whiteman stated.       According to Keyser coach Derek Stephen, "Even though making it this far was a good thing and it showed what our kids are capable of. They did everything that we asked them to and took everything in stride. It just stinks that we get to this part in the season and, we've made it this far but we're not able to finish. If this would have happened earlier in the season, it still would have been hard to take, but it would have been easier. But when you get to within one week of the playoffs, it just makes everything so much harder to take."       Adding insult to injury for both Frankfort and Keyser is the fact that both have done so well that they have positioned themselves for a good chance at a playoff run that may or may not happen. Having this happen in any year is bad, having it happen in a year where both teams really had a shot at making their mark makes it doubly disappointing.       "It for sure makes it worse. We came into this year unsure about COVID and the coaching change and losing a bunch of players. Now that we see how our kids responded, and how they came together, and how our seniors led us on the field and off.  Having that chance at a playoff game and especially at home means a lot to us, but having that chance taken away really, really stinks," Stephen stated.       According to Whiteman, "It definitely makes it worse, just knowing that we're sitting at 7-1, I'm certain win or lose Friday night we would have got at least one home game in the playoffs. I just think that we would have had a great opportunity to make the playoffs and advance once we got there, so having a successful season adds a lot more to it."       As expected, this has dealt a horrible blow to the kids.       "It's horrible for them, how else could you expect them to be? They come out here everyday and work their tails off and go to war for you everyday as a coaching staff, and that's what breaks your heart the most. All sports are difficult, but football is a very difficult, physical, brutal game. You watch these kids come out here day in and day out and bust their tails for you and try to get prepared, get excited. Especially the seniors, to have this taken away from them. They wanted a chance to get the Mineral Bowl back. It just unfortunate," Whiteman stated.       "It's unfair to the kids because they've worked hard, they've tried to do the right thing. They've been together out here working hard and I don't think it's fair to take this away from them. It's a horrible shame," Whiteman continued.       According to Stephen, "I've only talked to a few of them over text message, but I think they are taking it every bit as bad as we are. I know they want to play, and they would do anything we could do to play. Being Red, I'm not allowed to get them together and talk to them. I would really like to get them together and tell them what is going on, and get them together and let them air their grievances as well."       "I haven't talked to all of them but I know they are taking it hard, especially the seniors, because they're getting a season cut short once again that they won't be able to replace," Stephen explained.       Despite the fact that the game won't be played, both head coaches were gracious enough to give their thoughts on what they would have expected of the game. Both praised their own teams and were quick to heap praise on their opponent as well. There is certainly a feel from both sides that all signs pointed to a tight, competitive contest.       "It was going to be a really good game. We were coming in at 7-2 and they were coming in at 7-1, so we were both highly ranked teams. I think MetroNews picked it as the game of the week, which actually hadn't boded well for us in the past, we usually lose those games," Stephen jokingly stated. But, they're defense is pretty stingy and would have been going up against our high scoring offense, I think it would have been a real good game, Stephen explained.       According to Stephen, "I don't know what Coach Whiteman does to them down there but he always gets them fired up for this game and I know our kids were ready to play as well. It's the only week of the year where you don't have to get that little extra excitement going during practice or the game, because everybody knows it's Mineral Bowl week. These are the kids you see the most, and they get to interact with them the most in school, especially at the Technical Center, so it's always a big game every year."       "I think it would have been a close game.  I think it would have been a Mineral Bowl to remember," Stephen stated.       "First of all, I think it would have been a very good game.  The last several years there have been some lopsided games that aren't really fun, because once it gets out of hand it's not fun anymore.  But, I think this year would have been different, I think it could have went either way," Whiteman stated.       According to Whiteman, "I think they are very explosive on offense, they score a lot of points, they keep you on your toes with their no huddle. They have multiple threats on offense.

Police arrested dozens of people in New York, Portland, Oregon, and other cities overnight at protests demanding all votes be counted in the race for the White House, while smaller groups backing President Donald Trump returned to tabulation sites in closely contested states to cry foul over the election.
 In Minneapolis, police cited more than 600 demonstrators who marched onto a highway Wednesday night protesting Trump's threats to challenge the election results, as well as a variety of social injustices, authorities said Thursday.
 The protests came as the Trump campaign insisted, without evidence, that there were major problems with the voting and the counting of ballots.

Paul Scholes lashed out at Manchester United‚Äôs defence after Demba Ba punished some lacklustre organisation on a historic night for Istanbul Basaksehir.
 The manner in which the well-drilled Turkish champions defended contrasted markedly with the schoolboy efforts that saw United punished by Ba in the 13th minute.
 Inexplicably poor awareness and organisation allowed the unmarked ex- Newcastle, Chelsea and West Ham striker to collect a long ball and run from the halfway line to score.
 United legend Scholes was incredulous as to how his former side could leave Ba on his own and described the defending as ‚Äôembarrassing‚Äô and ‚Äòall over the place.‚Äô
 He said on BT Sport: ‚ÄúSurely you always have someone back on the halfway line, they‚Äôre pointing at Matic. You‚Äôre always goalside, it‚Äôs like Under 10‚Äôs football.

Somewhere buried deep within the hackneyed genre thriller "Let Him Go" resides a pretty nifty story about the give and take between a long-married Montana couple confronting age, grief and an elusive connection with their widowed daughter-in-law. Because said couple is played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, aka the adopted parents of Superman no less, only adds to the richness of a character study rife with beauty and tenderness.              In other words, all the ingredients for a satisfying night at the movies for folks of a certain age looking for entertainment mirroring their own messy lives. But writer-director Thomas Bezucha eschews all in favor of pandering to the masses in the confines of a dumbed down equivalent of "Deliverance" meets "The Fighter" in which an adorable grandson serves as the grand prize sought by warring families clinging to widely divergent values. Who wins? Does it matter? Not to Bezucha. He consistently goes for the cheap and easy, grinding nuance into the ground with a heavy boot heel. At least it has the esteemed Lesley Manville working well outside her wheelhouse trading her usual British working-class environs for something akin to Melissa Leo's Oscar-winning turn as the matriarch from hell in "The Fighter."              She's Blanche Weboy, a nasty piece of Black Hills redneckery lording over her doltish sons and a brother (Jeffrey Donovan) wearing his menace on his sleeve. It's late 1950s Gladstone, North Dakota, although the time period and location never really fit in with what boils down to a heavily armed custody battle between busybody grandparents with nothing better to do than wield guns, hatchets and ornery dispositions. What Mom, the kid's birthmother, thinks doesn't seem to occur to anyone. She's merely a pawn in a high-stakes contest of last man - or in this case, woman - standing.              I would classify what transpires as cynical and jejune, but that might insinuate Bezucha has anything of value to add in weakly adapting Larry Watson's novel about warring Midwestern grandparents acting like selfish, violent idiots. Bezucha is disappointingly pleased to stick to the basics in proving heads are thicker than blood. Shame, too, because Costner, Lane and Manville act the hell out of it. I'd even rate it as one of Costner's finer moments as a hunky thespian. But he, like his two excellent female co-stars, is constantly undermined by cheesy writing and ridiculous implausible happenings that can only unfold in a movie sourced from a dime-store novel.              OK, I get it, "Let Him Go" is a neo-Western pitting white hats against black hats, or put in more modern terms, Red State values vs. Blue State. The latter, of course, are well represented by Lane and Costner, aka the "good guys." They are cut from the thick oak of Middle America principles and beliefs insisting words are far more persuasive than bullets. Except that strays far from the philosophies of the knuckle-dragging Weboy clan, particularly young, budding domestic-abuser, Donnie (Will Britain). He's the new, not-so-nice husband of the recently widowed daughter-in-law of George and Margaret Blackledge (Costner and Lane), Montana ranchers who seem to have nothing better to do than spend their days stalking their 5-year-old grandson, Jimmy (Bram and Otto Hornung), and his mousy mother, Lorna (Kayli Carter).              Almost on cue, Margaret happens to see Donnie smack the kid and Lorna with the back of his hand. Jimmy must be "rescued," she thinks, but before she can act, he's disappeared along with Lorna and Donnie. It's time to load up the vintage Chevy and head across the border into North Dakota to snatch the kid back. Rational, right? Why bother getting attorneys and welfare workers involved when a snub-nosed pistol is just as just in settling legal fights?              The fun starts when George and Margaret find their way to the drably appointed shack the Weboys call home. It's like a gathering of crazed mouth breathers getting their kicks chopping off extremities with hatchets. Do Nana and Pop-Pop stand a chance against these troglodytes? To Bezucha's credit, the ending isn't quite the neat-and-tidy kumbaya you're expecting, but that doesn't prevent it from becoming a barrel of unintentional laughs.              Still, it's worth seeing it just to bask in the brilliance of Costner and Lane. They have the smarts and chemistry to fully sell their roles as adoring man and wife who will do anything for each other, including kidnapping, murder and coercion. I jest, but they actually are an extremely attractive couple who are so adorable together I caught my heart melting. But once the guns and contrivances are brandished, they lost me. So did "Let Him Go," a movie about family that's more childish than paternal; more corrosive than healing. But it has Lane and Costner. And in the midst of a stifling pandemic, they're about as welcome as welcome can get.              Al Alexander may be reached at alexandercritica@aol.com.               "Let Him Go"       Cast includes Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Lesley Manville, Jeffrey Donovan and Kayli Carter. In theaters starting Nov. 6.        (R for violence.)        Grade: B-

Christopher Nolan isn't worried about the box office earnings for Tenet. "I'm thrilled that it has made almost $350 million," the director said.

With that being said, Nolan is worried that other studios aren't looking at the bigger picture when looking at the theatrical release of _Tenet_. Most reports about the box office earnings are comparing them to a time before the public health crisis took hold, which the director believes is unrealistic and not good for the future of movie theaters.
