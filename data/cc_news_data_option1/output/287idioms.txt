Allowing the carcasses of dead deer to remain in the Oostvaardersplassen Nature Reserve has a positive effect on biodiversity in the area. Not only do the carcasses attract many more insects and other arthropods in the short term, but also in the long term, due to increased plant growth. Plants located near animal carcasses became five times bigger than usual, leading to a surge in the number of plant-eating invertebrates on the plants and, therefore, also in the number of their predators.

You would think that we would have learned our lesson about secrets. President Nixon and "all the president's men" thought that they could get away with it. But every word uttered in the oval office found its way into print and the public. The Watergate tapes ripped the mask off the public image of politics and left an entire generation disillusioned.                 Twenty years later, Bill Clinton assumed that what he did in private would remain secret. But what happened with Monica Lewinsky behind closed doors became public record resulting in the second presidential impeachment in history. In his autobiography, Clinton confessed, "The question of secrets is one I have thought a lot about over the years. … Secrets can be an awful burden to bear, especially if some sense of shame is attached to them … Of course, I didn't begin to understand all this back when I became a secret-keeper. … I was always reluctant to discuss with anyone the most difficult parts of my personal life."                 The Wikileaks secrets were first released in 2010. Most of the documents appeared to be trivial and petty. Some of them serious. All of it stemmed from words written and spoken in secret places that the participants never dreamed would be read or heard by anyone else. But what was said in private is now public.                 Edward Snowden released classified national security documents to the mainstream media in 2013. Facing possible prosecution in the United States, he continues to live in Russia.                 Jesus warned us that our secrets would become public. He said, "But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops." And again, He said, "For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light."                 Our conduct in secret is the most important part of our life. What we do and say when we are alone, when we think no one else is looking, that is the part of our life that will ultimately determine our success or failure. Jesus constantly encouraged his followers to focus on what they did in secret. "When you pray," He said, "go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you." And, "when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you."                Jesus taught that those who say and do things privately that they do not want others to know about are like cups that are only washed on the outside. A slimy green scum continues to grow on the inside. He compared people who keep up a public image that is not consistent with their secret conduct to marble tombs in graveyards. They appear whitewashed and clean on the outside, but inside they are filled with rotting flesh and decayed bones (Matthew 23:26-28).                When you do what is right in private, what is seen in public will take care of itself. The most important part of your life is the secret part.

Democrats contend that Trump's abuse of power — pressing Ukraine for an investigation into a Trump Democratic rival, Joe Biden, at the same time Trump's administration withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid — is a “quintessential impeachable offense."

In Washington State you are under no obligation to submit to a FST. If an officer asks you to exit your vehicle and complete a [FST], it is critical that you know your rights.

In general, you can and should politely refuse to take any FST. These tests are not measured by an objective standard and typically will only serve to harm your DUI defense.

BROTH IS THE new black. Or the new acai, or kombucha, or cold-pressed juice — whatever the current thing is that we must-must-must consume if we want to remain young and beautiful forever. Bone broth in particular is renowned for its collagen-boosting properties, giving your skin a taut, youthful glow, so naturally we on the cutting edge of culture have found a way to counteract all that by adding booze to it.            A little tippety-tap with your fingers around the internet will tell you that broth-based cocktails are all the rage right now, in the spirit (ha!) of mixologists seeking out edgy liquids to include in drinks — gunpowder, tobacco syrup and squid ink come to mind. But drinks made with broth or stock, adorably called “stocktails," are actually an old idea, a throwback to when distilled spirits were not libations, but medicines. In days medieval, people did not regularly drink what were then called _aquavits,_ or sometimes “Geneva Spirits,” unless they were dying, when the local apothecary would mix them with broths made of herbs, spices, whole pigeons, animal dung and horse placenta.

The impeachment case is pegged to Trump pressuring Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter Biden, based on discredited theories about the younger Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine while his father handled U.S. foreign policy in the country as vice president.                    Joe Biden predicted that Republican senators will one day be ashamed of their fealty to Trump. “I think it’s one of those things they’re going to regret when their grandchildren read in history books what they did,” Biden said. “I don’t get it. ... I think it has a lot to do with whether they can win primaries. Everybody knows how vindictive the president is.”                    Indeed, Trump has shown a willingness to go after Republicans who criticize him. But most GOP senators facing reelection this year do not yet have significant opposition from within their party. Arizona Sen. Martha McSally is an exception. And newly appointed Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler also could draw opposition from the right.                    Biden, in his interview, did not discuss the possibility that the Senate could call him or Hunter Biden as a witness. Biden has maintained that he sees no “legal basis” for his or his son’s testimony, because the House impeachment charges are about Trump’s actions.                    ___                    Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”

Metro uses terms such as "trip" one way when referring to its base fares but tallies its monthly statistics and Commute Card use according to a different way. Following the Federal Transit Administration, Metro considers a Commute Card "trip" to be a bus ride without a transfer ("unlinked passenger trip").6 Every time someone uses a transfer, they are taking a separate "trip". Thus if you travel from your home to a transfer point and then change buses to complete your journey, you have taken two "trips." If your home is outside one transfer point and your workplace is outside another, you are taking three "trips."

TORONTO -- The federal government says it will contribute to a national campaign to help cover funeral costs for families affected by the deadly plane crash in Iran earlier this month.            The prime minister's parliamentary secretary, Omar Alghabra, says Ottawa will match funds raised during the Canada Strong campaign launched days after the Jan. 8 crash.            The campaign, organized by Paramount Fine Foods founder Mohamad Fakih, aims to raise US$1.5 million for those who lost loved ones when a Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down by the Iranian military.            Alghabra says the federal government will match all contributions up to the campaign goal.            He says the campaign has raised just shy of $600,000 so far.            All 176 people on board flight PS752 died during the crash just outside of Tehran, including 138 people who were bound for Canada.            The Canadian Press has independently verified the identities of 93 people with ties to Canada.

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.                "No, I wasn't," he said.                "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."                "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.                "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."                Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.                "What did I say?" he wondered.                "Begone," I replied.                "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.                "Yes."                He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"                "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.                "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."                This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.                Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.                "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.                I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.                "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."                "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"        "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.                "Fine," he said. "Begone."

“Recipe for a Perfect Wife,” Dutton, by Karma Brown            Although she agreed when her husband suggested they move to the suburbs, Alice is feeling out of sorts with her new slow-paced life. While trying to fill the time, she finds entertainment in an old stack of letters penned by the woman who once lived under the same roof in the 1950s. In “Recipe for a Perfect Wife,” author Karma Brown uses the antiquated beliefs of the past to encourage a modern-day woman to look at her marriage and life in a new perspective.            In the current timeline, Alice is fascinated by the previous home owner’s day-to-day activities. As she reads personal letters Nellie penned to her mother decades ago, Alice soon recognizes that her life isn’t technically that different from the woman who lives to keep her husband happy while maintaining an organized home. Alice decides to view Nellie as an inspiration. She loses herself by attempting to make meals from old-fashioned tried and true recipes, learning how to garden, and dabbling in updating her wardrobe with vintage pieces. Can Alice be the perfect housewife like Nellie?            Or is Nellie’s perfect person a front? During the 1950s timeline, Brown reveals that Nellie’s marriage is anything but ideal. In fact, Nellie’s husband is abusive and most days revolve around how to keep peace with a man who is unfaithful, how to hide bruises on her arms from her friends, and how to be rescued from a cruel situation.

“They will be finding remains in that river for 100 years," Giffin said.            Off of a dirt road in Weybridge, Vermont, where Clark, the Revolutionary War soldier was laid to rest, some of the other 20 or so sets of remains in the graveyard have been lost in the soil and stream.            “You're talking about a whole cemetery being eroded over the bank,” Giffin said. “I’ve never seen one as bad as this one, ever.”            For now the cemetery's future remains uncertain. A woman who lives part time in the historic stone home adjacent to the cemetery had offered land onto which the graveyard could be moved. Before taking on the cemetery, Selectboard chairman Don Mason said he thinks the dirt road leading to it that was damaged in a storm needs to be repaired first.            Clark’s remains are being held by the town in a box . He and his wife's headstones have been moved away from the bank.            Like so many aging graveyards, the costly repairs are often the responsibility of the towns or cemetery associations, which may lack the funds to protect these sites.            “When you go to town meeting and you ask do you put money to an old cemetery, (or do) you buy new text books, it's kind of a no-brainer for the town,” said Giffin. “But this was a big piece of not only Vermont history but United States history. ”

She said that for the Arkansas game, every possession is going to be a crucial possession. She said the most important things putting points on the board and not giving the Razorbacks second chance opportunities.            Arkansas averages 86.9 points per game, which is third in the country. Morrison said that the Bulldogs are ready and have their game plan ready to go.            “I look forward to this game because at the end of the day we get to see which speed wins the game.

When Victoria Derbyshire proposed a TV version of her Radio 5 Live Show to former BBC News boss James Harding, he gave her the green light within days.                             BBC News has a big problem in connecting with some licence fee payers away from big cities and from poorer backgrounds - or, in the jargon, "underserved audiences".                             For Harding and BBC News, Derbyshire - and the show's first editor, Louisa Compton (now at Channel 4) - were the solution to a big problem.                            It worked - online.                            Derbyshire's programme was highly effective in reaching those people, through original journalism, investigations and scoops of a kind that the BBC generally struggles to do. But on linear TV channels it failed to garner a sufficiently big audience to justify its cost.                            First it was chopped from two hours to one. Now it is gone.                            BBC News is looking to make big savings and re-organise its structure so that digital journalism is prioritised.

Great, thanks. You guys have mentioned that your core expenses were flat with the third quarter and a year ago, and the guidance for 2020 is a 50% overhead ratio, up from 49% this year. Could you kind of maybe square the circle on that a little bit? I mean are you expecting -- given that the margins are expected to be down in 2020, could you just talk a little bit about what the actual outlook for expenses kind of is in 2020 for -- in dollars?

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.                        "No, I wasn't," he said.                        "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."                        "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.                        "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."                        Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.                        "What did I say?" he wondered.                        "Begone," I replied.                        "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.                        "Yes."                        He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"                        "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.                        "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."                        This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.                        Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.                        "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.                        I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.                        "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."                        "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"            "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.                        "Fine," he said. "Begone."

The one other thing -- I'll make this quicker, Chris -- margin. Some people use margin. Some people use it responsibly. In my experience, most people use margin don't use it very responsibly. A lot of people see the market rise for 10 years, and they're thinking, "Great. I'm going to borrow more than I have and put it in these stocks that keep going up." And then, all of a sudden, when we have a few days like what we're talking about right now, the classic line about the tide's gone out, and who was wearing pants, who was wearing a bathing suit, and who wasn't. Usually, the people who are really embarrassed, ashamed, and are in pain are those who overmargined. So if this is you, obviously we're sorry for it. But if you're playing the lifetime game of investing, which is what we're playing, you have time to come back. I have friends who made mistakes with margin in the past. They smartened up. And after it smarted for a while, they did better, they invested in, I would say, a more Foolish way. I'll speak to this quickly -- margin's not bad or wrong unless it's too much for you, in which case it's going to feel really bad on weeks like this.

CLSA has a buy rating on GAIL India in the long term with a target price of Rs 180. Shares of GAIL ended down 0.9% at Rs 126.7 on Tuesday while the BSE Sensex closed 205.10 points (0.49%) down at 41,323.81.   Company FInancials  For the quarter ended 30-09-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 18235.45 crore, down -1.26% from last quarter sales of Rs 18467.44 crore and down -5.73% from last year same quarter Sales of Rs 19342.88 crore.

The company’s top management includes Dr.Anup K Pujari, Dr.Ashuotsh Karnatak, Dr.Rahul Mukherjee, Mr.A K Tiwari, Mr.Ashish Chatterjee, Mr.Dinkar Prakash Srivastava, Mr.Gajendra Singh, Mr.Jayanto Narayan Choudhury, Mr.Manoj Jain, Mr.P K Gupta, Mr.Rajiv Bansal, Mrs.Banto Devi Kataria. Company has ASA & Associates LLP as its auditors. As on 31-12-2019, the company has a total of 4,510,141,866 shares outstanding.    Investment Rationale  GAIL is trading near its 10-year low PE and at a sub-6 times core PE, stripping off the value of investments, said CLSA. Being a leveraged play on India’s gas demand story with volume picking up in 2020, CLSA sees GAIL as an attractive buy. Any plans of unbundling gas transmission may be positive in the short term as the demerged valuation may be much higher than implied by its current stock price, said CLSA.

But we clever moderns have figured out how much fun said spirits can be, and we now create cocktails with everything under the sun (horse placenta: probably coming to a craft cocktail bar near you). One of the early stocktails actually meant for enjoying is the “Bull Shot,” which is a bit like a tomatoless Bloody Mary, comprised of vodka, beef broth, lime, celery salt and Worcestershire (and/or hot sauce, if you like).            The Bull Shot was supposedly invented in Detroit in the 1950s, right in the middle of the Dark Ages of food in America, which began with industrial-era convenience foods and out of which we are just now beginning to crawl. The art of making fresh, homemade stock was one of the saddest things to fall by the wayside, this essential element of cooking reduced to an MSG-laden bouillon cube. The idea of adding water to that block of forced umami and then drinking it with vodka for fun is everything that was depressing about "Mad Men."

"[The children] struggled with it more than we did, in particular because when it was raining - and in winter especially when it snows sometimes - we'd have to get them kitted up with waterproof trousers and waterproof coats, to get to school so they'd arrive dry.            "We'd pull up outside the school and they'd need to get undressed from their waterproofs. It felt they were becoming conscious of themselves and other kids looking at them.

While their aggressive defense did create some early foul trouble, the trade-offs were worth it, as Wa-Hi took advantage of the created opportunities to push what was a 12-9 lead at the end of the first period into a 25-11 bludgeoning by the half.            “It’s hard to get the kids motivated to play a team they beat by a lot the first time, but they responded, and we were able to take control of the game,” Poynor said.            The first time the Blue Devils and Suns squared off this season, Wa-Hi took a 78-25 result back to the team bus.            The Southridge girls put up a much better fight in this game, pestering the Blue Devil offense throughout the game.            But the Blue Devils never let the pressure get to them.            “It’s something we practice every day,” Poynor said. “We talk about getting comfortable with the pressure, and the more we practice it, the better we get at it.”            That tight defensive pressure is much easier to deal with when a team has a player like Wa-Hi’s Rian Clear.            Clear is averaging 22.0 points per game on the year, good for third in the state among all classes, but her contributions go beyond scoring.            In this game in particular, Clear demonstrated her court vision and flair for passing, as the Suns had her double-teamed for most of the game. And she devoted her efforts to spreading the floor and creating opportunities for her teammates to score.            “She’s an overwhelming talent,” Poynor said. “You recognize her right away on the floor. (Southridge) did a good job of containing her, for the most part, but she was still able to find her teammates and get to the rack.”            Two of those teammates stood out on the night.            “Monica Miller has been a force for us,” Poynor said. “She’s been stepping up, moving the ball up the court and being able to create, Emmy Ogden was able to finish well tonight, and Rian was able to assist them, as well, so it was a really good team win.”            Senior center Mia Huxoll left the game after a pair of Southridge girls collided with her in the post on a rebound attempt. Her status after the game was unknown.

In 1718, the famed and feared pirate, Blackbeard, ran his flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, aground near what is now known as Beaufort Inlet.                                Actual items from that ship, after spending nearly 300 years in the waters of the Outer Banks, will be displayed at the N.C. Transportation Museum, 1 Samuel Spencer Drive, Spencer, through March 29. "Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge" is a traveling educational exhibit created by the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.                                Blackbeard captured the French slave-ship, known as La Concorde, in September 1717. Renaming the vessel Queen Anne's Revenge, Blackbeard terrorized the east coast, including a week-long blockade of the port of Charleston, eventually commanding a flotilla of four ships and 300 pirates.                                It was in June 1718, however, that the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground in Topsail Inlet. The ship was lost, but Blackbeard's adventures continued until November, when the famed pirate was killed in an attack led by Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard.                                Nearly 300 years later, in 1996, the Queen Anne's Revenge was discovered at Topsail Inlet, off the coast of North Carolina. The ship's identity was confirmed, and ever since, items have been pulled from the depths, painstakingly documented and preserved. A permanent exhibit is on display at the N.C. Maritime Museum, 315 Front St., Beaufort. Through this traveling exhibit, Blackbeard's legendary story is also being told at locations across the state.                                Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge features weaponry, nautical tools and personal items from the ship. Iron spikes that held the vessel together, plates and spoons for shipboard dining, cannon balls featuring a Swedish maker's mark, grenades and lead shot are all part of the exhibit. Touch screens tell the pirate's story and provide information on the shipwreck's recovery. Displays explore 18th-century pirate life, while a gallows and gibbet show how many of these sailors paid for their piratical deeds.                                "Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge: 1718" also includes hands-on kid's activities like pirate dress up, with available pirate garb and photo stations. Kids can make their own pirate flag. A rope-tying station shows how to tie the knots used by pirates. Bell-ringing activities also show how pirates regulated their day, announcing changes of the watch, mealtimes, prayers and danger.                                Admission to the N.C. Transportation Museum is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors and military, $4 for children 3-12 and free for children 2 and under. The museum is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday. Beginning in March, the museum will also be open Sunday from noon-5 p.m. For more information, visit www.nctrans.org.

When police stop a driver after dark on a weekend, chances are they already think the person is driving under the influence. However, in order to make a DUI arrest, police need "probable cause". This means they must have facts leading a reasonable person to believe that the person is driving under the influence of intoxicants. In other words, police cannot just arrest someone on a mere hunch that the person is intoxicated while driving. They need specific facts suggesting the person is actually driving drunk. Police officers develop probable cause, or facts, through their own observations. Much of these facts come when the driver performs and fails the field sobriety tests (FSTs). The common FSTs include an eye test following a pen, the 9-step line walk and turning test, and standing on one foot for 30 seconds. In addition to these three FSTs that people typically think of, there is also a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT). This is a small, hand-held, electronic breathalyzer tester used for roadside breath tests. Just like the FSTs, the PBT test is entirely optional. Drivers are under no legal requirement to take a PBT.

MongoDB has been very public about the MongoDB Realm roadmap that will include the fusing together of several parts. Besides GraphQL as the query language, Realm as the mobile database and synchronization platform, MongoDB is also blending in its serverless platform which includes functions and triggers, authentication, data access rules, and server-side code deployment. Serverless platforms are popular with mobile developers because they don't have to worry about having to provision servers for unpredictable and highly spikey workloads.            The roadmap will unfold in several stages over the course of this year. Currently, Realm is available in private beta for manual deployment; GraphQL, being announced today for preview, will provide simplified client-side access. Later this spring will be the public beta of Realm, which at that time will supersede MongoDB Mobile and MongoDB Sync. In the summer, the plan is to integrate Realm into the serverless back end with SDKs, although some odds and ends such as consolidating all the billing for mobile sync services and query-based sync will come later on.            There are a bunch of moving parts in all this as, for instance, Realm objects are different from the JSON objects that are persisted in the MongoDB mother ship, and often carry different dependencies. The unified SDK will hide all the complexity under the hood.            This is not the first time that MongoDB has taken advantage of a new acquisition to make a technology leap. Just over five years ago, MongoDB acquired WiredTiger, and then used the new acquisition to replace its original MMAP storage engine that had scaling issues a year later in the 3.0 version. Arguably, that was a much more radical shift, as it entailed migrating the entire installed base.

BRAINTREE -- Mayor Charles Kokoros said his proposed debt exclusion on a $63 million borrowing to pay for the town's share of a new South Middle School and other school projects would cost the average homeowner $192 in property taxes per year, and the amount which would decrease after five years.            Kokoros shared some details of the proposal at Tuesday night's meeting of the town council.  The council will vote on Feb. 4 on whether to place the package before voters at a special election on March 28.            Included in the debt exclusion is $55.5 million for the construction of a new South Middle School with another $31 million coming from already approved state school building funds.  Kokoros said that he has studied the town's finances since the day after he won the office, and said the town doesn't have the money in its operating budget to make the loan payments on the school.            "The only way I see to do it in a fiscally responsible way is a debt exclusion," Kokoros told the council.            He said the debt exclusion would also give him flexibility to take on other municipal building projects.  Since taking office on Jan. 2, Kokoros said he has been touring all municipal and school buildings.            Former Mayor Joseph Sullivan had proposed borrowing $85.5 million for the South Middle School, with the state money being used to repay the loans.  Sullivan had said the town could pay for the new middle school out of the town's operating budget, as was done with the East Middle School expansion and renovation project.   That proposal was withdrawn Tuesday night without discussion.            The package also includes $5 million for the replacement of the roofs at five elementary schools and the Kindergarten center, $1.5 million for a feasibility study of the redevelopment of Braintree High School, and $1 million for security improvements at school buildings.            All of the items would be subject to voter approval of the debt exclusion.  The town would seek funding from the state school building authority for the school roof work.            District 5 Town Councilor Lawrence Mackin Jr.  said it was "disappointing to say the least" that voters are being given a little over two months to decide on the package, or risk losing state school building money.  And, he wonders what has changed in recent months that has lead to the need for a debt exclusion.            "The answer remains to be seen in that the information regarding the funding of this project was never attempted to be explained until now," he said.            A debt exclusion is a temporary tax increase tied to specific projects and ends when a borrowing is repaid.  It differs from a Proposition 2½ override, which is a permanent tax increase.            The council voted Tuesday night to refer the package to its ways and means committee for a review.  The committee has scheduled a meeting for 5:30 p.m. Jan. 29 to discuss it.            District 5 Councilor Meredith Boericke, who chairs the ways and means committee, says residents who cannot attend the hearing should send their questions about the proposal to the mayor's office, the school superintendent's office or her at mboericke@braintreema.gov.

The majority of the flows into Indian stocks from foreign investors (FPIs) of over Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019 came into the top-performing blue-chips. Some of the flows have also trickled into mid- and small-cap stocks in this period. ET has compiled 10 smaller stocks in which FPIs have raised their stakes consistently in 2019. Bloomberg consensus estimates of analysts’ price targets show these stocks can return between 15 per cent and 40 per cent in one year.   SHRIRAM TRANSPORTAt current market price, the stock is attractively priced trading at 1.2 times FY21 estimated book value, according to Rahul Pandey, analyst, Karvy Stock Broking. “Going ahead, profits of the company for FY19-22 is expected to be 15.3 per cent CAGR owing to moderation in provisioning amount and reduction in corporate tax rate from 34 per cent to 25.2 per cent,” he said.   REPCO HOME FINANCEAccording to Arjun Pasumarthi, analyst, Chola Securities, the stock is valued at Rs 376, assigning a price to adjusted book value of 1.2 times its FY21estimated numbers. “The challenging demand environment in the market coupled with management’s cautious approach towards lending, we expect loan growth to stabilize at current rate in near term and thus maintain our loan growth at 13 per cent CAGR over FY19-21”.   REDINGTON INDIARedington’s execution — 11 per cent YoY revenue growth in spite of slowing economic growth and the reduction in working capital days — is commendable. Although growth in the overseas businesses has slowed, overall revenue and earnings growth remain strong. “Considering the company’s improving ROCE profile, its valuation at 8.3 times FY20 estimated EPS is attractive” said Pranav Kshatriya, analyst, Edelweiss Securities.   EQUITAS HOLDINGWith visible ROE expansion to 16.4 per cent in FY21 on the back of strong AUM growth and lower operating expenses, Equitas Small Finance Bank’s valuations will gravitate towards that of other SFBs, banks and NBFCs demonstrating similar growth and profitability. “We remain positive on the stock given strong earnings growth of 53 per cent CAGR over FY19-21 and value Equitas Holdings at a 55 per cent discount to SFB, at 1.4 times FY21 adjusted book value of Rs 122, post factoring the holdco discount,” said Jehan Bhadha, analyst, Nirmal Bang.   BAJAJ CONSUMERWith the pledging overhang behind, valuation at 16x PE looks appealing for the analysts who see gradual rerating in the stock. “We raise our target multiple from 20 times earlier to 23 times, to reflect improved business prospects from strategy changes. The stock, trading at an FY21 estimated 16 times PE remains attractive,” said Nitin Gupta, analyst, SBICAP Securities.    73508406   GIC HOUSINGGIC Housing trades at 0.7 times FY21 price to adjusted book value as against its five-year historical average of 1.8x on a 1-year forward basis. “Risk-reward is extremely favourable because even with a small improvement in the demand environment,” said Amit N Rane, analyst, Quantum Securities.   ASTER DM HEALTHCAREWith the benefits of the management’s cost optimisation initiatives expected to start accruing and the ramp-up in new hospitals resulting in operating leverage playing out, analyst expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 140 bps over FY19-21. “At 6x FY21 EV/EBITDA, Aster continues to trade at a significant discount to peers” said Anmol Ganjoo, analyst, JM Financial.   GULF OIL LUBRICANTGulf Oil’s business model is right on all key drivers, which has resulted in consistent market share gain in the past and the trend is likely to continue. “The tie-up with OEMs, investment in the distribution chain, and product innovation will drive Gulf Oil’s performance” said Nidhi Doshi, analyst, Dolat Capital. “However, due to slowdown in auto industry and less movement of vehicles, we maintain accumulate rating with a target price of Rs 977 based on 18 times FY21 estimated earnings”.   BSEBSE is a value play with a higher dividend at low valuations and option value from new segments such as the mutual fund platform, commodities and INX over and above the value of its core segment. “BSE stocks value includes its core operations ex-cash income of Rs 125 per share, implied value from CDSL’s market price at 20 per cent holding company discount at Rs 100 per share, owned unencumbered cash of Rs 300 per share and float income from encumbered/margin money at Rs 225 per share” said Anmol Garg, Analyst, Motilal Oswal.   IDFC “We have a positive outlook on IDFC First Bank in the long term, however, taking exposure to IDFC can provide better returns than buying IDFC First Bank, valuation-wise even after factoring-in 30 per cent holding company discount” said Amit Rane, analyst, Quantum Securities.

This scarcity presents a number of potential concerns for community banks intending to seek a sale. First, the scarce number of buyers may reduce competition for even the most attractive community bank target, thereby potentially reducing the price obtained in the process (which could, of course, also reduce the interest of banks considering a sale). Second, the reduced number of potential buyers may make the timing of the transaction depend more on the specific acquisition timing plans of the remaining buyers. As they need time to digest other transactions, potential transactions may be subject to different timing pressures. Third, it increases the likelihood of needing to potentially cast a wider net for potential acquirers or the need to think outside the box. I believe the existence of these concerns increases the value to be received in retaining an investment banker with experience in the community banking space, as the abilities to assess market conditions, understand what potential buyers are looking for and formulate a cohesive story of the acquisition will make investment bankers’ advice increasingly valuable.

"Sinn Féin support a ban on fracking and have called for a moratorium on any new exploration for fossil fuels on the island of Ireland.             "At least 80% of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground for us to achieve the urgent target of 1.5 degrees of global warming.            "This is a target we cannot miss, and one which this new Executive and Assembly must commit itself to.            "In light of the evidence, and the burning moral case to take radical action against climate breakdown, I have asked Minister Dodds to confirm that both of these new licences have been rejected."

It’s a remarkable feat of television production, honestly. When the show started, Rob Lowe was a healthy and happy New York City fireman with a son who was in a loving relationship with a longtime partner, and the Austin fire department was fully staffed and alive and protecting an area of Texas that included a working fertilizer plant. Less than 15 minutes later, Rob Lowe has cancer and his son relapsed and half a dozen firefighters are dead because of a surprise manure explosion and now he’s in Texas to try to deal with all of that. And it all started, everything, including everything that happens going forward, including Rob Lowe saving a baby that was launched 20 feet into a tree in a car crash, because of one flaming burrito.

The idea may be attractive to Republicans seeking a legal basis to acquit Trump of having abused his power and obstructing Congress. But legal scholars dispute the idea that the Founding Fathers ever intended for impeachable offenses to require proof of a crime.            Historians are equally dubious that the argument from Johnson's lawyer, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, can be credited with securing Johnson's narrow acquittal.            “This is a way in which history is weaponized and distorted in order to give these kinds of arguments heft," said Rachel Shelden, a Penn State University history professor and Civil War-era expert. “It's a way of trying to promote an understanding of the Johnson impeachment that is false, based on what historians now believe."            At issue is the Constitution's standard for impeachment: “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." Over the centuries, the threshold has been understood to encompass actual crimes — judges have been impeached for soliciting bribes and sex abuse, among other offenses — but also noncriminal misconduct such as being drunk on the bench or favoritism in the appointment of bankruptcy receivers.            Johnson was impeached in part over accusations that he violated the Tenure of Office Act, which barred presidents from firing Senate-confirmed officials without Senate approval, over his removal of his War Secretary Edwin Stanton. Johnson's defense team questioned the constitutionality of that now-extinct law, and at his 1868 trial, one of his lawyers asserted that an impeachable offense “refers to, and includes only, high criminal offenses against the United States."            “There can be no crime, there can be no misdemeanor without a law, written or unwritten express or implied," said Curtis, a former Supreme Court Justice who served as Johnson's principal attorney. "There must be some law; otherwise there is no crime. My interpretation of it is that the language ‘high crimes and misdemeanors' means ‘offenses against the laws of the United States.'"            Dershowitz, who is expected to make a constitutional presentation to the Senate within days, said Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union" that he would paraphrase Curtis's argument that “the framers intended for impeachable conduct only to be criminal-like conduct or conduct that is prohibited by the criminal law."            “That argument prevailed. I will be making that argument as a lawyer on behalf of the president's defense team against impeachment. That's my role. It's very clear. I have done it before," he said.            But legal scholars and Democrats are decrying the claim that an impeachable offense must be an indictable crime. A former student of Dershowitz's at Harvard Law School described it as “rubbish." Turley, a George Washington University law professor, wrote in The Washington Post that such an argument was politically unwise and constitutionally shortsighted.            “They had to go outside the realm of constitutional lawyers and scholars to a criminal defense lawyer to make that argument because no reputable constitutional law expert would do that," said California Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He is one of the seven Democratic managers prosecuting the impeachment case.            Even Trump's attorney general, William Barr, wrote in a June 2018 memo before he was nominated for the Cabinet post that Congress could impeach presidents who abused their power.            Democrats contend that Trump's abuse of power — pressing Ukraine for an investigation into a Trump Democratic rival, Joe Biden, at the same time Trump's administration withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid — is a “quintessential impeachable offense." They say the Founding Fathers intentionally created a flexible standard of bad acts that could result in impeachment, and that Trump's acts in this instance are the framers' “worst nightmare."            Historians also point to multiple reasons for Johnson's acquittal and question whether senators found Curtis' arguments persuasive. Had Johnson been removed from office, he would have been succeeded by Benjamin Wade, the Senate president and a radical Republican disliked by more conservative Republicans.

NEWLAND — Avery County Parks and Recreation Department is reporting significant numbers in player signups for the upcoming youth basketball league seasons. Teams will officially begin their respective seasons this weekend with games at the Newland Rock Gym and Newland Elementary School gymnasium.          According to Avery Parks and Recreation Department Director Robbie Willis, approximately 300 kids have signed up to take part in the eight separate age divisions that the department offers for hoops during the winter.          “The ages are pretty equally represented across the board, with four teams each from pre-kindergarten all the way up through high school,” Willis explained. “This is the first year that we’ve offered a high school league, and we have about 35 participants signed up for that league.”          During Saturdays, Willis noted that both gyms in Newland will be fully operating with games throughout the day for age groups through second grade. Groups of teams participating from third through eighth grade will travel in interleague season contests with neighboring Mitchell and Yancey counties, with games also held at Cane River and Bowman middle schools.          Youth leagues are difficult to orchestrate without the use of numerous staff to help games proceed in an orderly fashion. Among the Avery youth leagues are numerous individuals who donate time in the form of volunteer coaches.          “We have a really good core group of about 60 to 70 volunteer coaches. We have about 35 head coaches, and about every one of them has an assistant. They go through the background check process and once they are cleared they are in the system and we use them. Some coaches also coach multiple teams, with one coach who is coaching three teams this season,” Willis said. “We would be finished if it wasn’t for our volunteer coaches.”          Each season the league utilizes a number of students to work as paid referees for the games, a system that Willis notes has paid lasting dividends.          “They’re usually just younger kids and college kids that we use for officials. Austin Lyons is our head official, and we use him, River Willis, Troy Hoilman, and a lot of high school and college kids who are or have been athletes, which works really well for us,” Willis explained. “I’ve been able to convince Mitchell County to also utilize available students as officials. They previously used high school officials which you have to pay a little more to use, but we’ve sort of trained our officials and have them start out with our youngest ages and work their way up the ranks to the middle school and high school levels at some point in time if they stay with us long enough.”          The Parks and Rec leagues are funded through fees of $50 per player, which includes the uniform for the students, while also helping to offset the cost for officials. The county also sets aside funding in their budget for the recreation department.          “Our numbers of participants continue to trend upward, and our county commissioners fully support the rec department and youth sports well,” Willis said.          The department also works with families to ensure that inability to pay is never an obstacle to participation, as need-based scholarships are available to those who are unable to afford the registration fees.          “We have extra funding built in to help cover other people. If a family can afford half, we will meet them halfway, but if a family is unable to meet that total, we will do everything we can to make sure they can participate,” Willis said.

How they were a missing piece of the ecosystem, and how things might change things if they returned.            Each time, he used that powerful two-letter word — “If wolves are reintroduced …” — because there was no guarantee this day would come.            Then it did. But there wasn’t time for him to marinate in the significance. There was work to do.            “For me, it was just kind of busy,” Bishop said.            His day began early. He went to Crystal Bench, east of Tower Junction in the northern part of the park. One of the park’s three acclimation pens was there. The wolves were to live in those pens until biologists believed they were ready for the wild.            After the truck convoy got through the park gate — where a crowd of wolf advocates, reporters and school children had gathered to watch — it headed east from Mammoth Hot Springs. Once it was close enough to the pen, it stopped and park staffers loaded six of the crates onto a mule-drawn sleigh. The sleigh carried the captive animals over the snow to Bishop and the others tasked with hauling the boxes to the pens.            It wasn’t easy — 100 pounds of wolf inside 100 or more pounds of metal. Four people per crate. They were as quiet as possible. So were the wolves, Bishop remembered, unaware of the fanfare of their journey.            He helped carry the second crate, which held the alpha male of what would become known as the Crystal Creek pack. Photos from that day mostly focused on the first crate — a good photo op for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who shared the load with Yellowstone superintendent Michael Finley and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Mollie Beattie.            In some of the images, Bishop can point to a glove or leg that belongs to him. But there’s one where he’s unmistakable. It hangs on the wall in his office. It shows him whispering in Babbitt’s ear, telling the secretary where the crate carrying the alpha female should go.            For a long time, wolves were viewed as a nuisance. Something to be killed, not preserved. People viewed them and other predators as dire threats to livestock and the wildlife species people liked better — like deer and elk.            The effort to get rid of wolves was successful in the Yellowstone region. While a small population held on in northwest Montana and Canadian wolves did OK, they were extirpated from the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. The last known pack was killed in 1926, though sightings of single wolves were occasionally reported after that.            Looking back on that era now, biologists and conservationists would view the park as incomplete. Bishop described it as a Bach concerto without the trumpets.            Crates being dropped off 25 years ago Sunday was the beginning of the return of the trumpets. Now, there are people old enough to drink and smoke and rent cars who have never lived in a world where the Yellowstone ecosystem didn’t have wolves.            Biologists and conservationists have seen it as a great success.            “It truly was and is a rebirth and recalibrating of what is the essence of Yellowstone,” said Finley, the former superintendent.            Doug Smith, the park’s top wolf biologist, was hired for the reintroduction and has spent the last two-and-a-half decades watching what came next.            He’s seen wolf numbers ebb and flow. The population peaked in 2004 at 174, but it’s since declined and stabilized. He said it has hovered around 100 in 10 packs since about 2008.            He’s seen the dire predictions propagated by opponents of reintroduction fall by the wayside. Among the wildest was the claim that wolves would hurt people. No one has even been bit by a wolf in Yellowstone.            He’s seen the ecological changes the wolves brought. Most prominent is the decline in elk. The population in the park’s northern range has dropped from roughly 20,000 to between 6,000 and 8,000.            That came to the chagrin of hunting outfitters north of the park, who can make money on big elk that cross the park’s border. But Smith and other biologists say that 20,000 elk was too many and that the park is healthier now. The park’s vegetation has benefited. Aspen and willows can grow taller without so much pressure from elk browsing for nutrition.            “Yellowstone is a better place with a fully intact carnivore guild,” Smith said.            Getting to that version of Yellowstone required about 20 years of preparation in the face of fierce opposition from people who thought the world was better without wolves.            John Varley, who was Yellowstone’s chief scientist through the 1980s and 1990s, oversaw much of that work. Because it was so controversial, he knew the park needed to take the time to explain how this could work without the sky falling. Some could never be convinced, but the case had to be made.            “You’ve got to get the public ready for this,” Varley said. “So that’s what we did.”            Bishop was a key player in that effort. As the park’s resource interpreter, his job was to explain science to people, to translate the intricacies of an immensely complex place. Wolves became a big part of his job, and he learned all he could about them. He wound up giving about 400 presentations around the country, making the case for bringing back the carnivore.            “He had kind of a road show,” Varley said.            Tall, thin and 87, Bishop lives north of Bozeman with his wife, Dorothy, in a modest house with an immodest view.            His office is full of books and documents he’s held onto over the years, many of them related to wolves. On a recent Friday, he showed off the parts of his collection he deems most relevant and launched into the story of wolves, like the road show never ended.            He talked about wolves living in Yellowstone long before it was a park, alongside the elk. He talked about 1926, the year the last wolf pack was killed. He talked about the early attempts to get traction for reintroduction, and how they foundered.            He listed the experts and scientists and bureaucrats who were crucial to the success of reintroduction. He’s still in touch with some of them.            And he described the success of reintroduction. How the predictions from the experts were pretty much right on, how the restoration led to a “quantum leap” in the world’s understanding of wolves through the hundreds of peer-reviewed papers examining their lives.            “When I say quantum leap, I’m not exaggerating a bit,” he said.            Soon nearly two hours had passed without anybody noticing but Dorothy, who poked her head into the office to let him know it was about lunchtime. He asked for a handful of grapes and continued.            Moments later, she reappeared with a wry smile and his order in a small white bowl.            “He’d rather talk wolf than eat,” she said.            Bishop came to Yellowstone after a couple of decades with the National Park Service as a naturalist and interpretive specialist in a few other parks, including Rocky Mountain, Death Valley and Mount Rainier. What he describes as a bureaucratic “fluke” brought him to Yellowstone in 1980.            He said the work he did to make the case for wolf restoration really began about seven years later, after the final Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery plan was signed. The document said it represented a “road map” to recovering the wolf population by establishing 10 breeding pairs in the recovery areas, which included northwest Montana, central Idaho and the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. What came next was a full environmental impact statement, which set the stage for the wolves to return.            As work on that document went on, Bishop traveled around, giving his talks. Milwaukee, Utah, Colorado — always with the word “if,” never proclaiming reintroduction to be a certainty.            It was starting to look like a certainty in 1994, with the finalization of the environmental impact statement and the hiring of the people who would make the reintroduction happen.

Midcaps and smallcaps were largely down in the dumps for the whole of last year. Yet, a newly-launched PMS strategy generated 29 per cent returns in last 14 months investing mainly in midcaps!  The secret? The PMS carefully picked shares of asset-light companies that had reinvestment moats, and avoided cyclical bets. The strategy is called Stallion Asset Core Fund, a PMS managed by market veteran Amit Jeswani.   The fund delivered second-best yields since inception among the PMSes that started their journey in last one-and-half years. Only largecap-focused Marcellus Consistent Compounders, run by Dalal Street veteran Saurabh Mukherjea bettered it generating 30 per cent returns in 13 months.   Jeswani says he invests in primarily two types of companies—those which do not need capital to grow and those which can consistently reinvest their capital at high ROIC (return on invested capital) and have a strong competitive advantage.  “Our portfolio is largely focussed on financials, consumer, pharma and technology stocks. We typically prefer B2C companies, but are open to buying B2B ones as well, if such businesses have a massive technology edge, like Bosch used to enjoy for decades in diesel engine,” Jeswani said.  The Rs 70 crore fund had 38.24 per cent of the corpus invested in financials, 19.66 per cent in consumer stocks, 8.24 per cent in consumer technology and 6.65 per cent in diversified businesses. Rest 3.28 per cent was in real estate, data available on PMS AIF World showed.   Size matters in Jeswani’s investment philosophy and, hence, the higher allocation to financials and consumer-focused stocks.  “The biggest problem in being a long-term investor is that most businesses deteriorate as the size grows, and growth rates begin to dip. Hence, it’s really difficult to hold stocks for the long term. However, intrinsically, consumer and financials get better with size,” he said.  Jeswani said these two sectors would be the biggest beneficiaries as the Indian economy grows from $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion in size.  In last one year, Nifty Financial Services index has gained 22 per cent while Nifty Bank is up 13 per cent. Nifty Consumption and Nifty FMCG indices added 6 and 3 per cent, respectively, during this period, mainly due to a demand slowdown.  Jeswani says besides the rally in financials, the September corporate tax rate cut helped him generate 15 per cent extra returns. He said his bet on the consolidation of the economy has also paid off.  The Kingston University-educated fund manager is also bullish on commercial real estate players and owns shares of a leading residential real estate player, something not many of his peers have done. “Real estate is a great business model if you can pre-sell. Companies like Godrej Properties have no problem with pre-sales. You cannot bet on smallcaps in real estate, as most of them have ethical issues. You need to bet on the sharks in the ocean,” he said.  Even though he doesn’t own them, Jeswani is very positive on commercial real estate companies like Nesco, Phoenix Mills and Embassy and expect them to do well in the long run.  The realty sector emerged the dark horse of last one year. Nifty Realty index advanced 37 per cent, riding on the consolidation of the industry and a Rs 25,000 crore government booster. The rally was led by Prestige Estate, which surged 100 per cent, Brigade Enterprises (up 66 per cent) and Phoenix Mills (up 51 per cent).   Jeswani also sees another trend emerging in the current market rally. “The idea that investors can make gains in the late stages of a bull market by switching into laggard stocks has failed this time around,” says he.  “Our new learning has been that bull markets do not always broaden as they age — they sometimes narrow. The current bull market started in 2009, when shares rose indiscriminately. Then among the developed markets, the US took the lead. Then the technology sector in the US. Then just the ‘FAANGs’ (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google),” he said.  He said in the current environment where GDP growth rate has dropped to 5 per cent, it’s going to be a ‘winners take it all’ kind of situation for most industries. So, ‘the big getting better’ is his larger long-term theme now, Jeswani said.

Davidson County Sheriff's Deputy Robert Boggs happened to be at the right place at the right time to diffuse a fight between two men after one of them fired a gun in a crowded restaurant in Greensboro.                                Boggs said he was at the Steak 'n Shake Restaurant located at 4409 W. Wendover Ave. in Greensboro on Sunday afternoon when the incident took place.                                Boggs said he had just sat down at a booth with his wife and daughter after ordering their food when they noticed two men nearby having a disagreement. He said the verbal altercation quickly turned physical and the two men began fighting with each other in the middle of the restaurant.                                Boggs said at some point during the fight, one of the men pulled out a gun and it went off while they were still fighting. He said it was at this point he knew he had to intervene before someone was seriously hurt.                                "They were throwing each other all over the place and ended up on the floor," Boggs said. "I'm not usually going to jump into the middle of a fight, but when the gun went off I knew I had to do something."                                Boggs said he stood up and identified himself as a law enforcement officer and directed customers to get out of the restaurant. At the same time, he drew his personal weapon, which he legally carries when he is off-duty, and commanded the two men to drop the weapon and stop fighting.                                He said they eventually complied and Boggs held them in custody until Greensboro Police arrived shortly afterwards.                                The two men were arrested and were given felony assault charges.                                Leon Emanuel Rich, 59, of Greensboro, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Quincy Wayne Dowdy, 42, of Greensboro, was charged with assault inflicting serious injury.                                They were both transported to a local hospital for non-life threatening injuries sustained during the fight.                                At the time of the incident, Boggs happened to have an off-duty badge which identified him as a member of the Davidson County Sheriff's Office that had been distributed to the department in December.                                Boggs said he was thankful to have that off-duty badge because it helped the employees at the restaurant, other law enforcement officers and customers know he was a trained deputy.                                Davidson County Sheriff Richie Simmons said he gave his officers these off-duty badges specifically for situation just as these.                                "I couldn't be happier," Simmons said. "I use to have one when I was in the highway patrol, and so I wanted our officers to have something similar. Something that quickly identifies them as a deputy, so there is no question who he is."                                Simmons said besides giving sheriff's deputies another tool to protect the citizens, the off-duty badge has also brought the department together.                                "It has been a real morale booster," Simmons said. "It makes them feel like they are part of team, which we are, and it gives them something to identify themselves when they are off duty."                                Simmons said he is extremely proud of Boggs for diffusing a situation that could have been much worse.                                "He was amazing," Simmons said. "He acted in a very professional manner. Who knows how many people could have been hurt if it wasn't for him. We couldn't be prouder of him."                                Boggs said that he doesn't feel like he did anything more than what he was trained to do, but he said he was glad he just happened to be there.                                "The place was completely packed; there was a little baby at the next table," Boggs said. "It is a totally different situation when a gun comes into play. Someone could really get seriously hurt. I'm just glad I happened to be at the right place at the right time."

Inside the victorious locker room after the Tivy girls’ 67-10 win over Memorial on Tuesday night, coach Christy Dill handed senior guard Audrey Robertson a letter she had recently discovered in the mall.                    In retrospect, nobody inside that locker room should have been surprised by the letter’s contents. Robertson has excelled at basketball her entire life. Since she was 4 years old, she’s been playing basketball in the driveway with her two older sisters, Olivia and Juliana Robertson, eventual teammates on the 2019 Lubbock Christian team that captured the Div. II national championship. Audrey also plans on playing at LCU after experiencing a decorated career at Tivy. She’s been on two state semifinals teams, received first-team, all-state honors last season and leads the Lady Antlers (24-4, 10-1 District 26-5A) in both scoring (16.8 points per game) and rebounding (7.8 boards per contest) this season.                    But when Robertson opened the envelope and discovered she had received another honor, she was momentarily stunned. Inside the envelope was a certificate confirming that Robertson was a nominee to play in the McDonald’s All American High School Basketball game on April 1 in Houston. Former Tivy point guard Charli Becker received a nomination last season.

After what can best be described as a face plant on the road at Kansas State, the questions naturally started swirling about this West Virginia basketball team.                    Was it a one game aberration? Had the Wildcats found something that other teams could expose? What happened to the Mountaineers team that had navigated the first 16 games of the season? Was this a sign of things to come? How would this young team respond? And on, and on and on.                    It didn’t take long on the short turnaround against Texas to get the answer. Turns out motivating college kids for a 30+ game schedule can be a tricky proposition but there was no question about how ready to play the Mountaineers were going to be at home against the Longhorns after a listless performance.                    “I knew we were going to play. I knew we weren’t going to go through the motions like we did out there,” head coach Bob Huggins said.                    Turns out he was right and then some. West Virginia put together its most complete game of the season, somehow topping their performance against TCU the game before the road trip to Manhattan. The Mountaineers obliterated a quality Texas team with its trademark suffocating half-court defense, shooting over 50-percent from the floor and for the first time in conference play valuing the basketball.                    After averaging 18 turnovers per game in Big 12 Conference play, the Mountaineers had only 8 against Texas and a margin of 24-1 in points off those turnovers over the Longhorns.                     “I think they’re finally understanding it we can’t throw it away every other time,” Huggins said.                     The Mountaineers held the Longhorns to 36-percent from the floor and 30-percent from three, totals that were inflated in large part due to a 19-point outburst down the stretch with the game already decided. Those totals are much more in line with what the group had done through the first 16 games of the season as opposed to allowing Kansas State to shoot 59-percent and 50-percent from three.                     The Mountaineers finished with 97 points, the most that they’ve scored in a Big 12 game that finished in regulation since 2016, and they did it without any single player scoring more than 13. Take into account that the foot was very much off the gas pedal late in the contest and it could have been much worse.                     The starting five put together their best performance of the season with three of the five snapping out of prolonged shooting slumps to spark the offense.                     Rebounding was decidedly in favor of the home team as well with West Virginia at +28 on the glass, with the Mountaineers finishing almost with as many offensive rebounds (23) as the Longhorns had in total (25). Every loose ball, every effort play was made by the Mountaineers in a complete role reversal.                     Never was that more apparent than when freshman Oscar Tshiebwe chased down a loose ball that was heading out of bounds on the opposite end of the floor and then traversed the baseline to finish the play with a highlight reel dunk.                     There was a reason for that shift.                     “We really felt like we got embarrassed,” sophomore big man Derek Culver said.                    And to some degree, they did. It was only one game, but a telling game in the sense that the identity that this team had built in every contest before it was out the window. There was a noticeable lack of effort, particularly on the defensive end against Kansas State and the Wildcats carved them up.                     The Mountaineers didn’t just lose to a previously winless team in the league, they got manhandled. That was perhaps the wake-up call this team needed to show that it takes effort every single time out.                     “I feel like that wasn’t even our team we didn’t give ourselves a chance. We were eager to play again,” junior forward Gabe Osabuohien, who has scored 19 points over the last two games, said.                     Players credited the seniors and team leaders for gathering the group together and making them understand the gravity of their response. It was only one loss, but after the thin thread snapped that held last season together, it was imperative to stop any sort of questions about this team.                     Texas certainly isn’t as bad of a basketball team as it looked like at times Monday night and we already know that West Virginia is consistently that good. But for one night, the Mountaineers put it all together and they did at perhaps the most critical time.                     Now the question becomes, can an effort remotely like it be captured with any consistency? Regardless the answer that is a quandary that this Mountaineers basketball team would much rather answer.                     “I think the sky is the limit with this group. We’re going to be as good as we want to be. If we have games like this, I don’t see anybody beating us but we’ve got to be consistent. We can’t turn on the switch and turn it off when we want to, we have to come out and play like that every single game. It’s really going to be on us to determine how far we’re going to go this year,” senior Jermaine Haley said.

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.                                "No, I wasn't," he said.                                "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."                                "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.                                "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."                                Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.                                "What did I say?" he wondered.                                "Begone," I replied.                                "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.                                "Yes."                                He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"                                "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.                                "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."                                This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.                                Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.                                "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.                                I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.                                "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."                                "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"                "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.                                "Fine," he said. "Begone."

Other workers heard Knight yelling for help after the pair arrived at the Turnpike site. When they ran over, they saw Toney stabbing Knight with a trowel. The other workers tried to stop Toney, but he began moving towards them with the tool and then got into a truck and drove off.
