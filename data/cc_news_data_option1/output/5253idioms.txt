In our family alone, to date, six members have tested positive for Covid-19, one spent weeks in the medical center on a respirator and is now in a rehab facility over an hour away from home where visits are prohibited. Others of us have been forced inside our homes as prisoners for days on end, waiting for the green light, if symptom-free, and then moving cautiously into the real world.

Much has changed since September, when the Yuba-Sutter area was nearing its goal of moving into a lower tier in the state’s COVID-19 blueprint for reopening.
 Heading into the Christmas holiday, local case counts remain high each day, and deaths due to the virus have been occurring on a nearly daily basis. The area’s only hospital, Adventist Health and Rideout, also remains at capacity due to the latest surge in cases.
 “It wasn’t long ago that we were in the red tier and very close to moving into the orange tier,” said Bi-County Health Officer Dr. Phuong Luu. “Our case counts have more than tripled in just three months, and our hospitalizations and deaths have risen rapidly as well.” Under the tier system, the purple tier is the most restrictive, red is second-most restrictive, and orange the third level.

The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two coronavirus vaccines, one from Pfizer and one from Moderna, for emergency use, setting into motion the nation's largest vaccination campaign. Pfizer's vaccine, developed with Germany's BioNTech, was shipped last week after receiving the green light from the FDA and administered to health care workers first. Residents of long-term care facilities are also in the first batch of Americans receiving the coronavirus vaccine.

The standalone refrigerators, which are mostly volunteer-driven, have provided some relief, becoming part of a growing movement of COVID-19-era mutual aid. Stocked with contributions from stores, restaurants, food pantries and even people’s homes and gardens, items in the community fridges are free for all who need help — no questions asked.


--DocBreak--
The closest thing to regulations for community fridges are California's guidelines for charitable feeding operations, which Oehninger said still aren't enough to give communities the green light to operate fridges freely. He hopes to see new laws that set a standard for allowing free-food fridges nationwide, especially as the pandemic puts mutual-aid projects at the forefront of many communities.

Whereas the scope for scrutiny of any particular bonus decision is uncertain, the modern emphasis on process, ie what did you have regard to and not have regard to, could transform a bonus dispute. This is particularly relevant in the Covid-19 era where there may be pressure to cut corners. Executives may argue that consultation is required so they may understand what has been taken into account and what disregarded, or that management ought to provide reasons for the bonus decision so they (and potentially a court) can be satisfied that the right things were taken into account.

“I really don’t know what it is, I just like doing it,” Jones said. “I like helping people, that’s my biggest thing. I feel like I’m giving back.”
 Michelle Downing said the distribution program is supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture along with donations from local community partners including Adventist Health/Rideout.
 “Our mission is truly about helping those that are in need through partnerships,” Downing said. “… We have such an abundance of food that really I think there shouldn’t be anybody hungry. We have so much, and we have such good partnerships.”
 Jeff Swanson, the executive director for the Rideout Foundation, the philanthropic and charitable arm of the hospital, was also on hand volunteering at the food bank. He said there has been an effort in recent years to educate the hospital’s foundation board about the importance of supporting community well-being efforts. Swanson said the board unanimously approved partnering with the food bank on Dec. 14.
 “We see this as one of our critical needs,” Swanson said. “The work that this organization does in the community is critical.”
 He said being at the site volunteering, makes the impact of the food bank clear.
 “When you actually give it to someone and see the faces and see the families it’s going to impact there’s nothing greater,” Swanson said. “Seeing is believing I would say. If you can see, then you really believe in the need and the impact you can make.”
 The food bank and hospital distributed meals later on Monday at the Towne Center on Plumas Street and also at the Richland Housing Authority. Today they will be doing homebound deliveries in Yuba County to seniors over 60 and doing the same on Wednesday.
 “Just making an impact on individuals who need it who don’t otherwise have a way to provide,” Phillips said. “If we can lessen that burden in any way then that’s what we want to do. That’s what we’re here to do.”

When Stephen Curry sees Kevin Durant make his regular-season debut for the Brooklyn Nets Tuesday night, he doesn't anticipate a rush of adrenaline because he will be playing his former Warriors teammate.
 "At the end of the day, it's just another game," Curry said Monday. "It's our first regular-season game, so there's (already) a lot of excitement. It'll be cool to see him out there, and all those pleasantries, and then get to just competing."
 During Durant's tenure in Golden State from 2016 to 2019, the Warriors never missed the Finals -- pushing their total to five straight Finals appearances. In 2019's series, though, Durant tore his Achilles tendon as the Warriors lost to the Raptors. Less than a month later, Durant signed as a free agent with the Nets.
 But like he sought to join a championship-caliber team in the Warriors in 2016, Durant said Monday he viewed joining the Nets as a similar opportunity -- not as him leaving to build his own team.
 "I try not to make myself bigger than the group," Durant told reporters. "But I know what I add to a basketball club and I felt that way with the Warriors. So it wasn't about me going to the Nets to try to prove that I can make my own thing."

However, a beacon of hope came last Friday with the administering of the area’s first vaccines to local healthcare workers, Luu said.
 “It was an emotional day and the first light at the end of the tunnel,” Luu said. “But rollout of the vaccine to the general public will still take months, so we can’t let our guards down yet.”
 The number of COVID-19 cases increased by 171 on Monday, bringing the area’s total to 9,196 cases.

The courts have struck down residency requirements on constitutional grounds before, but never in the cannabis industry, which is still outlawed by federal law. In March, a Wellness lawsuit prompted the state to agree that it would not enforce the residency requirement for recreational applicants, but that agreement didn't address the state medical marijuana law.

There were whispers of a rematch between Diaz and Masvidal but that ship has likely sailed for the time being. After missing a whole year of action, 2021 could be a big year for Nate Diaz. A trilogy fight with Conor McGregor is always a possibility and there are plenty of other exciting matchups for him. Diaz was most recently seen talking some smack to Youtuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on Twitter.
