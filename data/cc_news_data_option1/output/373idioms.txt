"Minari" has been an unquestionable high point to this year's Sundance, a breakout critical hit that with exquisite tenderness and simple beauty brings to life a classic immigrant tale and a compassionate family drama. The film, an American production with dialogue mostly in Korean, has some heavyweight backers. It was produced by Plan B Productions (Brad Pitt is an executive producer), and independent distributor A24 is releasing it later this year.

 The minister also did not respond to the Conservatives' question about how much the RCMP spent on the original investigation into allegations Norman leaked cabinet secrets about a $700-million federal shipbuilding contract.
 That investigation prompted chief of the defence staff Gen. Jonathan Vance to suspend Norman as the military's second-in-command in January 2017. The popular vice-admiral was charged with breach of trust in March 2018.
 The Mounties and Crown prosecutors alleged Norman leaked information about the contract to pressure the newly minted Liberal government in 2015 to move ahead with the project to convert a civilian ship into a temporary support vessel for the navy, rather than cancel it.
 Norman pleaded not guilty before his lawyers spent months in court fighting the Crown and government for access to thousands of documents they said were essential for ensuring their client received a fair trial.

Home hope Marco Schwarz swooped down the Schladming slalom first run on Tuesday to lead the floodlit World Cup event ahead of a tight field.


  Austria is looking for a new slalom hero after the retirement last season of Marcel Hirscher and the 24-year-old Schwarz gave the crowd some cheer despite a slow start and a late wobble with a fast 51.41sec.


  The smiley, bearded Schwarz is on a roll after coming second at the Kitzbuehel slalom at the weekend.


  World Cup slalom leader Henrik Kristoffersen however sits just 0.14sec adrift with Frenchman Alexis Pinturault at 0.32sec in third.


  Kitzbuehel slalom king Daniel Yule of Switzerland is fourth but is a full 0.75sec off the pace while French whizz-kid Clement Noel finished 30th after a wide gate blew his game.

GENEVA/LONDON -- Most of the World Health Organization's (WHO) criteria for declaring a global emergency have been met, but it is awaiting clear evidence of a sustained spread of the new coronavirus outside China before doing so, some experts and diplomats said.


  The U.N. agency is seeking to balance the need to ensure China continues to share information about the virus while also giving sound scientific advice to the international community on the risks, according to several public health experts and a Western diplomat who tracks the WHO's work.


  The WHO has declared five global emergencies in the past decade, including the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.


  Doing so can hurt host countries because it may lead to flight cancellations and travel or trade restrictions, dragging on the economy.


  In the latest case, the WHO declined to declare China's coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern(PHEIC) twice last week, although its Emergency Committee was split "50-50" over whether to do so.


  "What was lacking for them to declare an international emergency were deaths abroad and human-to-human transmission outside of China," said the Geneva- based diplomat following the agency.


  "If there was proof of human-to-human spread among the 'imported' cases, the panel would lean towards another finding."


  WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier declined to comment beyond what he told a news briefing earlier on Tuesday.


  He restated that the WHO's criteria for a global emergency include a "serious or unusual" health situation that affects other countries and may require a coordinated international response.


  In reply to a question, he added: "It is not 'wildly spreading' outside of China."


  While the vast majority of the 4,500 or so confirmed cases and all 106 deaths so far have been in China, cases in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan where the virus has spread person-to-person have heightened concerns.


  "As information is coming in, it seems to be confirming our worst fears," Lawrence Gostin, university professor at Georgetown Law in Washington, DC, told Reuters.


  "So I do believe that the WHO is going to have to declare an emergency and is going to have to take the lead … You can't leave this to China."


  'A ROCK AND HARD PLACE'


  The WHO's 16-member expert panel is being "kept in the loop" and could be reconvened at any time to reassess the outbreak.


  "Just because of rising numbers in China now this would not automatically trigger an Emergency Committee," Lindmeier told the briefing.


  A declaration would lead to boosting public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce global spread. It could include recommendations on trade and travel, although the WHO generally tries to avoid disruptive trade restrictions.


  The Emergency Committee deliberations are secret and its members have been told not to speak about their debate, several WHO officials told Reuters.


  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Beijing on Tuesday to discuss how to protect Chinese citizens and foreigners in areas affected by the virus and "possible" evacuation alternatives, Lindmeier said.


  China has agreed that the WHO can send international experts there as soon as possible to increase understanding of the new coronavirus and guide the global response to the outbreak, the WHO said at the end of Tedros' two-day visit.


  Some experts believe the Geneva-based health agency is in a difficult position, having drawn fire in the past for acting either too quickly or too slowly.


  "Essentially the WHO is between a rock and a hard place," said Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity.


  Farrar noted that the organization was criticized for having called an early emergency in 2009 for the H1N1 flu pandemic, which proved mild, and then for being too late in declaring the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014. (Writing by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Mike Collett-White)

BALDWYN – The nearly $5 billion bedding industry has gotten a boost in recent years with the introduction of memory foam and other innovative products driving the industry.
 Among the leaders is Innocor, which opened a facility in 2004 in Baldwyn. It was a leader in the "mattress in a box" concept, which has exploded in popularity.
 While privately held, D&B Hoovers estimates annual revenue for Innocor to be around $850 million.
 On Tuesday, company leaders, joined by state and local officials, announced that the Baldwyn facility was about to wrap up a $4.1 million project that is adding a second production line and 90 more workers.
 Proclaiming the news was Gov. Tate Reeves, fresh from his state of the state address on Monday. It was his first economic development announcement in Northeast Mississippi as governor, but not his last, he said.
 “Mississippi businesses, like Innocor, are at the core of our state's growing economy," Reeves said. "We are proud to work with and support businesses like theirs as they expand and add new jobs to Mississippi's workforce. This expansion creates opportunities for those 90 people as well as their families to achieve more and thrive."
 Innocor, which makes polyurethane foam for mattresses, pillows and mattress toppers, and which is found in bedding, furniture and automotive industries, relocated another production line in what was its distribution center to accommodate the expansion.
 "We've been running seven days a week on our current line, and once we get the second production line going and have everyone trained, we'll be going to seven days a week on that line as well," said Innocor plant manager Kevin Lindsey.
 The addition of the new employees, which is all but complete, will raise the total employment at the plant to about 550.
 Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Red Bank, New Jersey, Innocor was formed through the 2014 acquisition of Flexible Foam Products Inc. and its integration with Sleep Innovations. The company has 22 manufacturing plants and distribution centers throughout the U.S., but officials selected the Baldwyn facility.
 "Innocor could have chosen any other state, but it chose Mississippi," Reeves said, touting the workers who stood nearby as the announcement was made.
 The Mississippi Development Authority provided a $650,000 grant to help with building and infrastructure improvements and equipment installation. Lee County and the city of Baldwyn will provide property tax exemptions.
 Innocor was acquired in 2017 by private equity Bain Capital for an undisclosed sum. Lindsey thanked Bain for its investment in the plant, which was recognized as the company's plant of the year in 2015.
 "The Baldwyn facility has established itself as a world-class manufacturer of bedding products," he said. "We pride ourselves as a flagship facility within Innocor and the bedding manufacturing space in general.
 "This expansion was not a 'build it and they will come' plan; this is a direct result of the vision, focus and support of (Innocor President and CEO) Bill Redmond and Bain Capital and the execution of all of our employees."
 Innocor plans to produce some 221 million board feet of foam this year – a distance that stretches from Jackson, Mississippi to Amarillo, Texas.

Multiple industrial operations are being equipped with power tools to benefit from their cost- effectiveness, lesser labour-induced work and higher efficiency. Furthermore, advancements in existing power tools are swiftly outpacing the upgrades done on conventional hand tools. In the long run, there is a possibility that hand tools might lose their applicability to power tools. Future Market Insights projects that during the forecast period 2017-2027, the global market for hand tools will showcase a moderate growth, registering a CAGR of 3.9%.
