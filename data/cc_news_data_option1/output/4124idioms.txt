Wolfgang's post comes a week after Eddie passed away following a lengthy battle with throat cancer. The musician reportedly died on Oct. 6 at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. He was reportedly in and out of the hospital multiple times throughout the past year. In November, Eddie reportedly sought out treatment for intestinal issues and received another round of chemotherapy. Over the last few years, he had been traveling back and forth between the United States and Germany in order to receive additional treatment for his illness. In the 72 hours before his death, his battle with cancer reportedly went downhill. Doctors had supposedly discovered that his cancer spread to his brain and other organs. Eddie died with his wife Janie, brother Alex, and son Wolfgang by his side. He was 65.
 Wolfgang released a statement on social media in light of the news of his father's passing. "I can't believe I'm having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," he wrote. "He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift. My heart is broken and I don't think I'll ever fully recover from this loss.

On Saturday we will have product demonstrations, a food truck, fire safety demonstrations, chainsaw carving, a 20% off storewide bucket sale, and a sidewalk sale with rock-bottom pricing on clearance items. All bucket sales will benefit Habitat for Humanity of Bulloch County. It’s a great time to stock up on items you’ll need for fall home and lawn maintenance.
 Fall is in the air and it’s time to catch up on some routine home and lawn maintenance. While the grass around Bulloch County is still green, it will soon go dormant and turn brown with cooler temperatures. But even a brown lawn needs some nourishment. Now is a good time to apply winter fertilizer to help nourish roots over the winter and have a healthy start in the spring. Keep your lawn free of leaves by raking or mulching the leaves with your mower.
 Once the leaves start to fall, gutters and downspouts can quickly get clogged with leaves and debris. Check and clean them as needed.Trim any low hanging branches near the house, and trim overgrown shrubs. Rake mulch that may have piled up against the house. It is a haven for bugs and other critters.

An ad from a group opposing a constitutional amendment to change the way Illinois taxes income warns voters the proposal would hit large and small businesses alike.
   
 "If approved, it would let the politicians immediately implement their plan to increase taxes on small businesses, farmers and large employers," the narrator says in an ad from the Coalition to Stop the Proposed Tax Hike Amendment.
   
 Currently, Illinois taxes all individual income at a flat rate of 4.95%. The amendment's approval would allow a new graduated rate structure to take effect in 2021, raising taxes for those earning more than $250,000.
   
 Corporations that do business in Illinois would also see their flat-rate income tax rate increase from 7% to 7.99% under the plan. But most businesses, especially small ones, don't pay the corporate tax. Instead, they operate as pass-through entities, which means their profits flow directly to the people who own them and get taxed as individual income.
   
 Just 3% of Illinois taxpayers overall earn enough to see an increase under the plan, according to the Illinois Department of Revenue. We wondered how different the picture could be for small businesses and their owners.
   
 Some -- not all -- businesses would pay more
   
 Based on the way the tax plan is written, the ad is correct that corporations and at least some small businesses operating as pass-through entities would be affected, said Carol Portman, president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers' Federation of Illinois.
   
 "But who exactly is going to be impacted by that tax increase is where the rub is," Portman said. "It's not an across the board increase on all small businesses. It's not an across the board increase on all farmers."
   
 Publicly available federal data isn't specific enough to show how many small businesses would be affected, experts said. And state data analyzed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration has its own limitations.
   
 The data does suggest only a small share of Illinois' 1.2 million small businesses would be affected by the tax plan, for the same reason most individuals wouldn't see an increase: only those earning more than $250,000 would pay the plan's higher rates. That's 189,000 taxpayers overall, according to state data published by the left-leaning Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, which supports the plan.
   
 Data suggests most small businesses would not be affected
   
 A spokeswoman for the coalition pointed to individual income tax data from the Internal Revenue Service for upper-income tax returns reporting different kinds of business income.
   
 "Based on IRS data, there are more than 100,000 small businesses in our state, including sole proprietorships, partnerships and S Corporations, that would be impacted by the proposed rates," spokeswoman Lissa Druss wrote in an email.
   
 Druss explained the coalition reached that figure by adding up the number of upper-income tax returns for different categories of pass-through income, then making reductions to account for data limitations. For instance, the IRS doesn't have an income bracket beginning at $250,000. Instead, its upper- income brackets begin at $200,000, which makes it difficult to determine which taxpayers would be affected.
   
 Experts suggested an even bigger problem with the published IRS data.
   
 "The table doesn't tell you anything about small businesses," said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former director of research at the IRS. "It tells you about the number of tax filers who have some business income."
   
 The dataset doesn't show how many separate filers have income from the same business, from how many separate businesses individual filers are drawing income, or how much of those filers' income is coming from other sources such as wages, Toder said. Filers may also have multiple kinds of business income, so adding up the categories risks counting the same taxpayer twice.
   
 Pritzker has led the push to switch Illinois to a graduated income tax. So we also reached out to his administration to ask for its numbers.
   
 Cameron Mock, chief of staff for the Governor's Office of Management and Budget, shared an analysis he conducted for the governor's team based on 2016 data from the state's Department of Revenue.
   
 That analysis estimated at least 95% of small businesses in the state will see no increase under the plan based on the number of them reporting less than $250,000 in net income, along with an assumption that a small share of owners whose businesses net less still make enough from other sources to push them over that threshold. But here too the numbers are not an exact match.
   
 Mock only counted the nearly half million Illinois businesses that file with the state as either partnerships or S-Corporations, which are businesses that pass along their incomes -- and most of their tax bills -- to shareholders. He did not count sole proprietors, because the state does not have data identifying them. S-corporations and partnerships may also have multiple owners splitting up the profits, but the analysis assumed just one individual was paying taxes for each because state data does not show how many separate taxpayers derive income from them, Mock said.
   
 J. Fred Giertz, an economist with the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, said the fact small business income is largely taxed at the individual level means it doesn't matter that available data can't tell us exactly how many would be affected.
   
 "There's no particular reason why you should say, 'I really feel sorry for the small business owner who's making a million dollars but I don't feel sorry for the opthamologist or the corporate lawyer who's making the same amount of money,'" Giertz said. "If you think the tax is good then they should be paying the tax. If you don't think that people above $250,000 should be paying the higher tax, it should not apply to anyone."
   
 Our ruling
   
 The coalition's ad says approving the amendment "would let the politicians immediately implement their plan to increase taxes on small businesses, farmers and large employers."
   
 Corporations will see an increase in their flat-rate income tax under the plan that takes effect if the amendment is approved. But only a wealthy subset of small businesses, which generally pass their profits to shareholders, would be affected -- and data suggests that portion would be small.
   
 We rate this claim Half True, meaning the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Grades 9 and 10 will now attend school in-person on Mondays, Wednesdays, and alternating Friday, grades 11 and 12 on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and alternating Fridays, for the time being.
 Students not in-person will be logging onto Google Classroom for the school day.
 The school is also planning to extend the distance between students in the classrooms. "Right now what we’re doing is trying to put a pause on any more contact tracing," Brinkman said. "We already were about three to six feet per classroom and now we’re going to get it up to even greater than that."
 The principal of the high school says that they wanted to take quick action after the positive cases came back.
 "The key that every principle is dealing with right now around the school districts is balancing education and safety, and making sure that those are equal," said Brinkman. "We want to make sure that we can get as many kids as possible in front of teachers safely."
 The Facebook post also mentioned that sports and extracurricular activities would continue, though students in quarantine would not be allowed to participate until further notice.

Those who steal political campaign signs will face prosecution if caught, law enforcement said Tuesday.
 In recent weeks, there have been several reported instances of political signs being disturbed or stolen from the lawns of Carroll County residents. in most cases, the signs have been for presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, but signs supporting the Trump-Pence ticket have also been taken.
 This week, Pat Rhudy, Chair of the Carroll County Democratic Party and candidate for state representative for District 18, wrote a letter to local law enforcement agencies, calling for a statement in the recent theft of Biden signs.
 In her letter, Rhudy said that on Saturday, she and two neighbors had signs stolen from their yards. She also said that a large Biden sign on a residence fronting U.S. Highway 27 had also been stolen, despite it being placed in such a location that a vandal could come to harm.
 These claims came two weeks after Carrollton Police Department recovered a pile of signs dumped near Lake Carroll, after they had been taken from residences in Carrollton. When these signs were found, Rhudy and Carroll County Republican Party President Rick Tillman each condemned stealing political signs of any candidate.
 Among the pile of signs was one with the word “evil” spray-painted on, as well as flags in support of the Democratic Party and the LGBTQ community. Additionally, Chris Dobbs with Carrollton police said that there was one sign in the pile for presidential candidate Donald Trump.
 Police said that owners could reclaim their signs at the police department and so far, one person has recovered their signs. Rhudy said that she urges anyone who has had a sign stolen to report it to law enforcement.
 Since Sept. 1, there have been five reports filed with CPD for stolen Biden campaign signs.
 Carroll County Sheriff’s Office has confirmed that deputies have also received two reports of stolen campaign signs, one being a Biden sign and the other a Trump sign.
 The Villa Rica police department has not had any reports of stolen campaign signs.
 “The Carroll County Sheriff’s Office would like to remind citizens in our community that trespassing on someone’s property and stealing a political campaign sign is a crime,” said a statement from the sheriff’s office. “We want our citizens within Carroll County to feel safe to post political campaign signs on their property without fear of them being damaged or taken, and unfortunately this is a common occurrence during election cycles.”
 A person who is found to have stolen a political campaign sign may be charged with theft by taking and a person who is found on someone’s property without permission may be served and or charged with criminal trespass.
 Dobbs with CPD confirmed that officers will fully prosecute anyone found stealing signs at the request of the owner and that individuals have the right to put their signs on their property.
 A statement from the sheriff’s office also confirmed that they will investigate any thefts of political campaign signs in their jurisdiction and offenders will be charged accordingly when identified.
 “Some helpful tips we can offer to help protect your signs would be to place them in well-lit areas and if you have security cameras, place them in view so that identifying a suspect would be made easier,” said the statement. “We ask all of Carroll County citizens to stand together regardless of political affiliation and treat each other with respect and equality.”

When Halloween returns each October, so do the 50-year-old memories for actress Judith O'Dea who starred as Barbra in the 1968 horror classic "Night of the Living Dead" as one of several characters taking refuge in an isolated farmhouse under attack from flesh-eating ghouls.      O'Dea remembers watching the film on the big screen for the first time when it premiered in her hometown of Pittsburgh, where the film was also shot, although she recalls identifying more as an audience member rather than one of the cast.      "I looked at myself and began critiquing my performance," said O'Dea from Los Angeles. "Then suddenly I found myself forgetting it was Judith O'Dea up there and became wrapped up in the storyline. That was a wonderful indication of a powerful story that could hold people's attention."      Over the years, O'Dea has also learned to look beyond the film's horror scenes and appreciate director George Romero's filmmaking skills.      "There's a scene where I'm pressing the button on a musical box which George was shooting from the floor up," she explained. "He was shooting right through the box and for a fraction of a second you see Barbra's eyes which I thought was a beautiful artistic shot. Then at the end when it alternates between still shots of the bodies and live-action, that was a great effective use of the camera."      The film, says O'Dea, broke barriers in the industry.      "As an independent movie made outside Hollywood, it raised its own money which I guess you could call one of the first Kickstarter's for a film. It was also filmed almost like a docudrama - unusual for the 60s - and there's no happy ending because everybody died."      Shot on a shoestring budget of just $114,000, O'Dea says her final scene being dragged from the farmhouse still haunts her.      "In your mind it's all pretend, but you get involved in the scene," she said. "With all those ghoul hands grabbing at me, it was actually quite frightening and took me back to the fear I felt as a child when I saw Vincent Price's face fall apart in the (1953) 'House of Wax.' That scared me so badly my folks had to take me from the theater. Whenever I'm called upon to be frightened in a role, I just think of that Vincent Price scene."      Another memorable scene from the film produced one of the classic lines in all horror films, said to O'Dea's character by actor Russell Streiner who plays her brother in the opening cemetery scene shot at the Evans City Cemetery in Pennsylvania.      "I don't think a week goes by that someone doesn't come up to me and say, 'They're coming to get you Barbra!'" said O'Dea, laughing. So has she grown weary of hearing the quote through all these years?      "How could I be tired of hearing something that has changed my life so considerably?" she says. "I love it when fans repeat the line to me. I feel so lucky to have been a part of something that was so different and has lasted so long."

Everyone experiences a bit of bad luck now and again, but for one Canadian tourist the bad luck has been extraordinarily bad over the course of the past 15 years and now, she's returning five artifacts to Pompeii in the hope of changing her fortunes. The woman sent the artifacts back to Pompeii with a letter indicating that she didn't want to pass on the "curse" they'd brought upon her to anyone she loves anymore.
 According to _CNN_the tourist, a woman identified only as Nicole, sent back five small artifacts -- two white mosaic tiles, two pieces of amphora vase, and a piece of a ceramic wall -- to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii. The artifacts were accompanied by a letter that detailed why she was sending them back and called herself "young and dumb" when she took the items in 2005, having wanted " a piece of history that couldn't be bought."
 As for the bad luck the woman was "cursed" with over the past decade and a half? Her letter noted that since returning to Canada from Pompeii all those years ago, she's endured two bouts of breast cancer that required a double mastectomy. She also noted financial trouble for her family and cited the negative energy the pieces contain due to their origin -- the eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD which destroyed Pompeii and its residents.
 "I took a piece of history captured in a time with so much negative energy attached to it," the woman wrote. "People died in such a horrible way and I took tiles related to that kind of destruction."
 However, the woman did not send back all of the artifacts she took. Her letter noted that she'd given another tile to a friend and while she'd alerted her to the decision to return them, she was unsure her friend would follow suit. Interestingly, this Canadian tourist isn't the only person to send artifacts back to Pompeii. A park spokeswoman told CNN that others have also sent back artifacts with letters claiming bad luck over the years.
 While the Canadian tourist's unfortunate experiences are nothing to make light of, it seems that the concept of ancient things and curses just go together. Earlier this month, video of the opening of an ancient mummy sarcophagus in Egypt went viral, prompting the internet to not only make quite a few The Mummy jokes, but also express semi-serious concerns that opening said sarcophagus had unleashed an actual curse.

After asking the gentleman whether he planned to vote and, if so, whether he had decided on a candidate, Graber said the man told him “I’m not going to vote for anybody that brings socialism into this country. I was in Vietnam. I wasted my time if that is where we’re going.”
 After that exchange, Graber said he knew he was right in seeking the House seat.
 “That just said it all, for me. That’s what is at stake,” Graber added.
 When asked to grade Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds’ CoVID-19 response and recovery effort since mid March, Graber predominately gave her high marks – particularly for her resistance to a state mask mandate and more strict shutdown measures.
 “Being an American, or in this case an Iowan, if you give us the information, give us the facts, we’ll do the right thing,” Graber said
 He added that listening to medical advice is a critical part of dealing with the pandemic and then one must make the best decision possible based on the information at that time.
 “Unfortunately, you only know if you were right or you were wrong after the fact in these cases.”
 Graber says the governor listened to medical advice, but then also diligently reviewed data and saw that not all parts of the state were the same in terms of positivity rates.
 “In Lee County, we don’t have the large numbers that some others do. It might have been an over-reach in the early stage when experts told us millions were going to die,” he said in reference to the governor’s shutdown of nonessential businesses in March.
 He believes that because of the ordered shutdown of some businesses, the state was right is providing financial support to those affected by the move.
 “A lot of people live paycheck to paycheck and if you interrupt that, they can’t make it. Businesses rely on those people to come in and spend money. The state was obligated to help. If you make it so I can’t run my business, you need to do something to offset the loss,” he said.
 But Graber acknowledges the well-intended relief effort encountered a less than perfect delivery system.
 “The process had problems, old software, an overwhelmed system where people couldn’t get through. Those are all things we need to fix.”

The Carroll County Animal Shelter is still overcrowded with cats and kittens that need adoptions and foster homes following last month’s adoption event.
 An influx of these animals normally occurs during the breeding season of May- October, but this year the numbers have also increased due to the coronavirus pandemic. That’s because veterinarian clinics were closed and so not as many cats were spayed or neutered.
 As a result, the shelter is searching for adopters and fosters to help ensure all the animals find a good, loving home.
 More than 300 cats and kittens were housed last month at the shelter prior to an adoption event on Friday, Sept. 25. Many of those animals were spayed and neutered before being available.
 The shelter, with the help of the Bissell Pet Foundation, then planned to reduce adoption fees earlier this month. The shelter is located at 251 Automation Drive.
 But county spokesperson Ashley Hulsey told the Times-Georgian on Tuesday there are still “too many” cats, kittens and dogs at the shelter waiting to be adopted. A few of these animals are featured on the Carroll County Humane Society’s website.
 “We are working on several new campaigns to increase adoptions and we have adopted out a lot,” Hulsey said. “The issue is we are taking in just as many as we are adopting out due to an increase in kittens from animals not being spayed and neutered during COVID due to vet closures.”
 The shelter is a no-kill facility, meaning healthy or treatable animals will not be put down and euthanasia is reserved for terminally ill animals, or those considered to be dangerous to public safety.
 Bissell Pet Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a mission to help reduce the number of animals in shelters through pet adoption, spay and neuter programs, microchipping and emergency support.
 The foundation, in conjunction with more than 160 shelters in 33 states, hosted an “Empty the Shelter” event last month and adoption fees were reduced to help empty the overcrowded shelters.
 Residents can visit the Carroll County Humane Society website or contact the shelter at 770-214-3590 to adopt a new pet.
 Because kitten season is in full swing, animal shelter staff said they need the community’s help in providing a “loving and caring individual environment” to these cats and their kittens.
 Those who wish to foster must be able to safely house kittens and/or the mother cat with nursing kittens for the duration of the program, which is typically until the kittens are eight weeks old and weigh at least two pounds.
 Fosters must also give the kittens adequate and age appropriate food, and fresh water, every day. Clean bedding and litter boxes must also be provided. New owners must also be willing to spend time with the animals to socialize the kittens.

In reality, his positive statement was in reference to the Coronavirus Task Force and various public health officials who have been navigating this pandemic. In a statement, Fauci told CNN about this matter, "In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate. The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials."

  One would be hard pressed to not notice the doom and gloom that has beset the local retail base in many small and medium-sized communities. COVID-19 has set in motion closures and bankruptcies of many small businesses across the country. The economic conditions in many local communities are also struggling as their business tax base is slowly being eroded. However, through all this economic pain and suffering, there is ample opportunity. Local businesses and communities willing to invest their time, energy, innovation and resources to counter the negative can actually come out of this crisis stronger and more resilient than ever.


  It is true shoppers have increased the usage of national chains via e-commerce due to lockdowns and convenience, thus pinching their local retail base. But this comes with inherent opportunities for the local retail base, media companies, and their communities. Shoppers love unique experiences versus the mundane sea of sameness that engulfs most retail and online shopping experiences. After all, if you go into most national chains or e-commerce sites, nothing is really different.

LIFE IN THE BALANCE BY JAIME CULEBRAS, SPAIN - WINNER OF BEHAVIOUR - AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES: A Manduriacu glass frog snacks on a spider in the foothills of the Andes in northwestern Ecuador. As big consumers of invertebrates, glass frogs play a key part in maintaining balanced ecosystems. That night, said WPOTY, Jaime's determination to share his passion for them had driven him to walk for four hours, in heavy rain, through the forest to reach the frogs' streams in Manduriacu Reserve. But the frogs were elusive and the downpour was growing heavier and heavier. As he turned back, he was thrilled to spot one small frog clinging to a branch, its eyes like shimmering mosaics. Not only was it eating – he had photographed glass frogs eating only once before – but it was also a newly discovered species. Serenaded by a frog chorus in torrential rain, he held his umbrella and flash in one hand and the camera in the other – Jaime captured the first-ever picture of this species feeding

CHEYENNE — After being booked into the Laramie County jail for her second DUI offense, Laura wasn’t sure where to turn.


  “At that point, it was just like, ‘I don’t know what to do anymore,’” said Laura. “I don’t know how to get help, I don’t know how to stop, but I don’t want to do it anymore. I don’t want to be in trouble. I don’t want to be in jail.”


  Then, last year, she was referred by a judge to the county’s DUI court program, one of a few initiatives that offers an alternative to time behind bars for those dealing with substance abuse issues. Before that referral, Laura, a lifetime Cheyenne resident who was granted confidentiality by the WTE due to personal conflicts, had never gotten to attend counseling due to its high costs.


  Soon after her referral, at a monthly cost of just $50, Laura was receiving weekly counseling and drug tests, followed by an intensive outpatient program that she attended three times a week. At the end of this summer, Laura completed the entire DUI court program, which she credits for getting her life back on track.


  “Basically, if it wasn’t for DUI court, I’d probably still be drinking if I wasn’t in jail or worse situations,” Laura said. “I would either be in jail to finish out my sentence, which was two years, or I could potentially have been dead from the effects of drinking, because I was dealing with a lot of health issues, like with my pancreatitis.”


  Since wrapping up her time in treatment court, Laura has enrolled in virtual classes at Casper College, where she is focusing on addiction studies.


  “When it comes to anybody who’s in DUI court and stuff like that, the staff is super supportive and understanding,” she said. “So I’m basically going to go to school so that I can continue helping people, because I know that was another thing that completely helped me was having people who supported me, but didn’t judge me.”


  But in the near future, Wyomingites like Laura may not have access to DUI courts, or their counterpart drug court programs. With the state already forced to cut about 10% from its 2021-22 biennium budget, and another round of cuts looming, the treatment court programs are among several components of Wyoming’s judicial system likely to be hampered by the reductions.


  With Wyoming facing a projected $1.5 billion revenue shortfall over the next two years, nearly every state agency had its budget cut by about 10% this summer. The cuts to the district attorneys’ offices in Laramie and Natrona counties, however, were not quite as large as for other agencies.

  Campbell suffered serious injuries in the 3:30 p.m. crash on private land in Loudon and was taken by ambulance to Concord Hospital.


  He was not wearing a helmet, Fish and Game officials said.


  "Fish and Game conservation officers would like to remind all riders that operating snowmobiles without adequate snow cover is dangerous and not recommended," the news release states.

Back in September, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said “one of the few good things about (the pandemic) is it has provided an opportunity to try some different things in the game on a one-year basis that I think has been a positive overall.”
 So in 2020, baseball experimented with the universal designated hitter, seven- inning doubleheaders and putting a runner on second base to start extra-inning games. If only they had taken it a step further and experimented by showing teams other than the Yankees in prime time, perhaps they could’ve marketed the game by showing off the next generation of stars — players such as Fernando Tatis Jr., Tim Anderson and Ronald Acuna.

Deaf and Disability inclusion in Hollywood is still a work in progress and there is a huge need for diversity across the board.

The more people we have in the room and who are part of the process, the more we can grow in this industry. I’m hoping _Deaf U_ might be a stepping stone in that direction and inspire more Deaf productions to be made.

“It's been surreal,” Matlock said. “Sometimes it's hard to believe where I came from and with what's happened that I'm here playing and I'm a Bronco and I get to go out there and practice on the field. It's just awesome. Being around the all the guys and the coaches, it's a sense of family and more than just football.”
 Matlock, the Idaho Press 2018 Sports Stars Inspirational Athlete of the Year, would have been an easy player to root for whether he did much on the field or not. But the redshirt sophomore appears to have put himself in position for a major role along the defensive line, which makes his story even better.
 “He had one of the best offseasons of anybody I've seen,” Danielson said. “I don't know if he's missed a workout since January. If the gym is open, Scott Matlock is down there working out. He moves better than I've ever seen him move.
 “I was watching some old film from last year when he'd get in the game if we were up a little bit or to give David Moa a breather and him right now is night and day different than he was last year. I'm not just saying that. When you guys see him play, you'll be like that's a different human. And I really do mean that. From how he moves to how he can strike an offensive lineman, get off blocks, his change of direction...I've been very happily surprised (with his rapid improvement).”
 The best part? Matlock potentially still has four years left in a Boise State uniform. As a redshirt sophomore he would have had 2020 and two more years, but an NCAA rule is not counting this fall against a players eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That means Matlock still has three years of eligibility left after this season.
 Matlock dreamed of running out onto the blue turf and playing for the Broncos. Now he's already entering year three — one that figures to be his best yet.
 “It's going by incredibly fast,” Matlock said. “It's very surreal. I don't know where the time goes. It's flying by for sure, but I'm trying to enjoy every moment and everything I can. The conditioning, the workouts, practices, I just want to take it all in and remember this forever.”

Calvin (‘Cal’, ‘Kelly’) Dale Noble, age 67, of Granby, Vt., passed away on Oct. 10, 2020 at home with his children by his side after a five-month battle with kidney cancer.
 Calvin was born May 5, 1953 in Concord, Vt., the sixth and last child to Clyde and Ruth (Shores) Noble. Calvin graduated from Concord High School class of 1972. Calvin met the love of his life, Nellie, while she was helping her dad at the Cook Shack at Granby’s Holiday in the Hills. Calvin and Nellie built their life and their home in Granby and were married October 9th 1976.
 Calvin loved his family and the town of Granby more than anything else. He enjoyed telling stories of growing up in town and of special times with his Dad, Grampa Shores and Uncle Freeman in particular. He didn’t leave ‘home’ often, but did enjoy a few hunting trips in Canada and a very special trip to Alaska with Nellie to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. Calvin was a jack of all trades and always enjoyed learning a new skill. He took a lot of pride in doing things himself. Calvin kept cattle, hens and pigs and loved to go hunting and fishing. He was quite fond of horseradish and loved his dandelion greens. Every year his mom would dig him some for his birthday. After she passed his siblings ensured he always had dandelion greens on his birthday. Calvin worked at Fairbanks Scales for 36 years where he worked as a machinist, night shift supervisor, and head of facilities. In 2008 Calvin was severely injured when another hunter shot him which left him with many health challenges. He fought them all with strength and courage that impressed everyone that met him. In this new chapter of his life he took on many new hobbies. He purchased a lathe and taught himself how to turn bowls and rolling pins. His favorite project was restoring his father’s Case tractor and taking it to local tractor pulls where he brought home a number of trophies.

 Lilly confirmed Tuesday that the study had been paused “out of an abundance of caution” and said safety is its top concern. The company would not say more about what led to this step.

 Fall Frenzy is a nice concept, but no one was refreshing his or her browser every five minutes to find out if either the Braves or Cincinnati Reds could actually score a run in their wild-card opener.

Mayor Josh Gooden met Gotay when Old 33 was still an incubated idea, waiting to hatch. Amid his mind filled with ideas already sketched out years in advance, Gotay’s established and planned contributions to the Elkton community are part of the foundation work leading up to a bigger, bright future in the town, according to Gooden.
 “It’s just great to have Rey add to the mix of amazing entrepreneurs in our community, and it's nice to know he’s there and wants to give back to the community and invest in our town,” Gooden said. “He’s thrown out a few ideas for different improvements to buildings downtown or parks.”
 Gotay said he is a perfectionist in his work and is proudest of his establishment of Old 33 because it is a reflection of his years of experience as a business owner and corporate employee. Gooden said that attention to detail has not gone unnoticed.
 “Just going above and beyond on projects that he’s already completed and going the extra mile to make sure things are done the best way they can,” Gooden said. “He’s just so talented.”
 Chelsey Lam is a server at Old 33 and said she respects Gotay’s supportive nature as a boss, which lends to positive relationships across the entire work team.
 “It's nice working somewhere where you can be accepted how you are and always know someone is going to be there for you,” she said. “It is really great. I love everyone I work with. I have a great boss.”
 Outside of Old 33, Gotay is part of the Akal Institute volunteer team for the Blue Ridge Projects of Shenandoah Wellness & Transitional Living Center, a therapy and rehabilitation center for athletes, veterans and trauma survivors.
 Lam said Gotay always practices thorough planning and oversight over projects, so she has confidence the ideas Gotay describes for the future of downtown will draw a splendor of success.
 “He definitely has a lot of motivation in seeing our town the best we can be, and he always wants us to be prospering and happy and healthy,” Lam said. “He really wants our community to stay up and running and stay happy.”
