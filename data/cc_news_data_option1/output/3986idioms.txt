“I had given up on being the lead,” she says. “I thought, ‘Well, maybe I’m just never going to be No. 1 on the call sheet. Maybe I’m just not going to be the star of the show. That’s OK. I’m just going to keep doing what I do.’”
 She did keep on. And it happened. That her big break materialized in a role that taps into her comedic side made all the sense in the world to those who know her.
 “From the beginning of her career, Justina has always been known to be a great dramatic actress,” Rodriguez, who knew Machado from their early days acting in Chicago before starring opposite her in “Six Feet Under,” said by phone. “What a lot of people didn’t know for a long period of time is she is incredibly funny. I’ve spent days and nights hanging out with her because of our families and she is the kind of person who will have you in stitches laughing. I just always had this secret hope that she would be able to show this side.”
 More pressing, though, is Machado‘s attempt to perfect the dancer side. She’ll have to leave in a few hours to rehearse for the show’s Disney-themed episode — she and her pro partner, Sasha Faber, were performing a Charleston routine to “Mary Poppins’” “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” — and she can’t help but let out a playful sigh of dread at the thought of getting back to the grueling grind.

“She is one of the best people I’ve worked with in my life — bar none,” says Moreno, who affectionately refers to Machado as _“nena”_ (sweetie). __ “She moves me. She makes me laugh. And she’s a terrific scene partner, because we have great chemistry and an enormous respect for each other. There’s something about her that is so true as an actress. And you can’t buy that.”
 Still, it’s not lost on Machado that she’s trying to prove television viewers will watch a show that revolves around a Latino family roughly two decades after a network executive suggested they wouldn’t. Machado was cast as the lead in the late ’90s comedy pilot “I Love Lupe,” which featured a Latino family. When the series wasn’t picked up, Machado, who was in her early 20s, received a call from the executive to explain why: “He literally called my house, nice man... and said, ‘My God, your pilot is so great. Everybody loves you, everybody. But we don’t think America is ready for a Latino family.’
 “That was acceptable for him to say — America’s not ready for [a] Latino family. Like, what? And that was the ’90s! And look at today. How many Latino families do you see on television? So America better get ready because we’re here. We’re here.”
 Born and raised in Chicago to Puerto Rican parents, Machado was always “making up scenarios” and roles to act out with her siblings but never imagined it could actually happen. On a recent episode of “Dancing With the Stars,” the actress shared a letter she found during a trip back home in which she, as a 5-year-old, expressed her desire to be a performer. But it wasn’t until her time in the Latino Chicago Theater Company that she gained the confidence to see herself as an actress and decided to make a career out of it.

Después de seis meses al fin los poblanos podrán tramitar alguna queja por despido injustificado, debido a que la dependencia permanecía cerrada Este lunes la Junta de Conciliación y Arbitraje y todas las áreas que la integran regresarán a sus actividades normales después de casi seis meses cerrados por la pandemia, aunque no se reintegrarán a sus labores los trabajadores con condiciones vulnerables al COVID-19. El pasado 2 de octubre en el Periódico Oficial del Estado el Ejecutivo publicó un decreto en donde se detalla que dicha actividad fue declarada como esencial, por lo que atendiendo los lineamientos federales se puede reabrir este organismo y todas sus áreas dependientes a partir de este 5 de octubre. El decreto detalla que la Junta Local de Conciliación y Arbitraje, las juntas especiales que la integran y la del Tribunal de Arbitraje del estado, pueden reincorporarse a partir del siguiente día hábil posterior a la publicación del decreto, es decir, este lunes, siempre y cuando atiendan los lineamientos de prevención. El decreto refiere que adultos mayores de 60 años en adelante, mujeres embarazadas o en lactancia, trabajadores con enfermedades crónicas no transmisibles, es decir, diabetes, hipertensión, padecimientos pulmonares y otras asociadas a las comorbilidades en riesgo ante un contagio de COVID, no pueden regresar hasta que lo decrete el gobierno. “Se decreta como actividad esencial las labores de la Junta Local de Conciliación y Arbitraje, las juntas especiales que la integran, así como del Tribunal de Arbitraje del estado de Puebla y su reincorporación a las actividades laborales presenciales propias de su competencia”, detalla el documento.

“Mosquitoes always develop in water, but the type of breeding place varies with the species of mosquito,” they said. More than 50 species of mosquitoes are present in Indiana. Breeding sites may include flood waters, woodland pools, slow-moving streams, ditches, marshes and the edges of lakes. Some species prefer container-like structures, like tree cavities, rain barrels, fish ponds, bird baths, old tires, tin cans, clogged gutters or catch basins.
 “After taking a blood meal, each female mosquito lays up to 400 eggs on the surface of water or where water is likely to accumulate,” they said. “Eggs may hatch in less than three days.” Larvae, called “wrigglers” mature in 7-10 days before changing into pupae, called “tumblers.” Then, in 2-3 days, adult mosquitoes emerge.
 “The most effective control of mosquitoes around the home is to prevent them from breeding,” they said. “This can be done by eliminating or altering existing breeding sites.” Many of our Indiana mosquitoes of concern are container breeders, so to eliminate breeding sites means to inspect and eliminate items around the home that collect and hold water.

 # Farmers, local leaders hail Sen. Metzger for grant to prevent Wallkill River flooding
 Daniel Axelrod
 Times Herald-Record
 WESTTOWN – Local leaders and farmers gathered Thursday morning near the Wallkill River in the hamlet of Westtown to celebrate a $400,000 state grant to help prevent flood-induced crop losses.
 State Sen. Jen Metzger, D-Rosendale, recently secured the funding for the Orange County Soil and Water Conservation District, a county Legislature- created entity that protects local natural resources.
 The State and Municipal Facilities Capital grant will aid the board’s multi- year, multi-million dollar Wallkill Floodplain Bench Project. The project is designed to prevent flooding to farmland along a stretch of the river that winds through the towns of Minisink, Warwick and Wawayanda.
 The project's planning began in 2013, two years after strong storms barreled through the region and caused tens of millions of dollars in losses to crops such as grain, corn and soybeans. The crops rotted after being engulfed.
 “Farmers were devastated by (Hurricane) Irene and (Tropical Storm) Lee,” said John Lupinski, president of the Orange County Farm Bureau. “With climate change these ‘50-year floods’ are happening more often.”
 Beginning next summer, three acres of soil will be removed along a three- quarters-of-a-mile section of land beside the Wallkill River – part of the affected towns’ border.
 Between $8 million and $10 million more in state funding is needed to finish the flood mitigation project, in an area stretching to the New Jersey border, said Kevin Sumner, the local conservation district’s manager.
 Since 2016, about 15 acres of soil has been removed along the river, helping to create an artificial flood plain that will protect thousands of acres of farmland, Sumner said.
 Over the years, local farmers have had to lower the water table by digging drainage ditches, while deepening the Wallkill River, all of which has contributed to flooding issues, Sumner said.
 Orange County’s leadership “has stepped up a lot and helped not only with funding, but with land services” to help prevent flooding in an farming area where the Pochuck Creek and Rutgers Creek exacerbate issues, Sumner said.
 But continued state funding to prevent flooding, thanks to leaders like Metzger, “who I’ve spoken with more in the last year than any other (state) politician” in 40 years, is critical to help farms, Sumner added.
 Metzger, chairwoman of the state Senate’s Agriculture Committee, said such grant funding is more important than ever because human-caused climate change and global warming are spurring more extreme weather events.
 “The investment of these funds will pay back huge dividends because every time there’s a major storm the economy suffers huge losses,” Metzger said. “We have to break that cycle and improve our resiliency.”

The Macomb trophy case will almost certainly expand following the boys golf season.
   
 The Bombers launched into 2020 by winning six invitationals as well as going 10-0 in dual, tri, and quad meets. Macomb heads into the Class 2A Monmouth- Roseville Regional at Gibson Woods Golf Course on Tuesday as the favorite to hoist the program's sixth regional plaque.
   
 This comes on the heels of Macomb missing the cut at last years' Class 2A state finals and finishing 10th.
   
 "Our kids had that little chip on their shoulder all season long," Macomb coach Greg Duncan said. "We came into the season with some pretty high expectations and high hopes."
   
 An impressive four-shot victory over Normal U-High and school-record 295 at the Notre Dame Invitational to open the season was proof Macomb had arrived.
   
 But the Bombers were just getting started.
   
 Wins at the Redbird Classic, the 46th Annual Gary Saunders Invite -- by 25 strokes no less -- and beating a solid Bloomington team in a triangular at WeaverRidge Golf Club followed.
   
 "We were able to revamp our schedule a little bit and at the same time keep it competitive," Duncan said. "Every opportunity we get to play, I tell our kids, 'You never know, it could be the last one.' We've kind of taken that mentality in as well and have wanted to go out there and perform at our best every single match day in and day out."
   
 Success has continued throughout the season, culminating with a school-record 283 and a victory at the Wayne Brinkmeier Invite at Byron Hills Golf Course in Port Byron. In the process, Braeden Duncan captured medalist honors with a 6-under-par 65.
   
 That round was the best in program history.
   
 "Winning is enjoyable for all," the senior said. "We like to celebrate, and we bask in it for a day or two, but the next day at practice we're right back to getting better."
   
 Greg Duncan says the worst kept secret of his team is how good they are up and down the lineup. Five of his golfers -- led by his son, Braeden, Jack Lockard, Connor Hamm, Griffin Taylor, and Connor Watson -- were averaging in the 70s heading into this past Wednesday's West Central Conference tournament.
   
 The father-son relationship, however, has been one of the most special parts of the season for Greg Duncan. He's watched his oldest develop on the course since he was 3 years old.
   
 Now, Braeden is reaping the rewards of a great season -- three invite medalist finishes and twice runner-up.
   
 "Those accomplishments are great to see as a father and as a coach that all that hard work and time that he's put in to make himself a better golfer has paid off," Greg Duncan said. "He's grown as a golfer and as an individual."
   
 Braeden Duncan says his on-the-course relationship with his dad is very limited. Usually, assistant Richard Sample walks with him during his rounds.
   
 And when the Duncan's get home?
   
 "We talk about (my round) -- what went wrong, what went well, how we can get better," Braeden Duncan said. "It's nice to have that part of it. He lets me do my own thing when I'm playing, really."
   
 What coaching Greg Duncan did have to do came after Macomb's first loss of the season -- a 10-stroke defeat at the WCC. His team, who shot a 344 and finished runner-up to Quincy Notre Dame, which is also at the M-R Regional, got a 'good, long talk' after the round.
   
 Braeden Duncan says it was a wake-up call for him and his teammates.
   
 "Obviously, we had an atrocious day," he said. "We don't want that (score to) let anyone get more motivated to beat us."
   
 As a result, the Bombers will refocus their efforts to fine-tune their games with regionals just days away. And with speculation of a possible tournament in the works following sectionals, the stakes to make back-to-back state finals is at an all-time high.
   
 So is the motivation.
   
 "Regional champion doesn't have the same ring as sectional champ," Braeden Duncan said. "And sectional champion doesn't have the same (ring) as state champion or state qualifier. We need to play well. We know that. … One bad round, one bad 344, our year is over, and we don't want that."

Commentators did not hesitate to express their indignation against the first 2020 presidential debate between Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. The debate was characterized by the prevalence of hostility, insults, accusations, and constant interruptions. Some writers even described it as the most juvenile presidential debate in US history, explaining that it resembled the childish taunts of two youngsters wagging their tongues at each other after quarreling. The media called on the opponents to rise to the occasion by raising the level of discourse. However, in my opinion, the time for civilized classical debates has long passed and both opponents are fully aware that the media nowadays favors this type of vulgarity and animosity.
 Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that the deep-rooted conflict between Trump and the Democratic party is very complicated and bitter. The Democrats have been waging a war against Trump ever since he took office; they impeached him and attempted to evict him from the White House twice on charges of treason and collusion with Russia and Ukraine. The Democrats have also pursued his men and imprisoned them. The media has also intensified its efforts and viciously attacked Trump and his family at every chance they got, fully believing that it is their patriotic and moral duty to bring him down, no matter the cost.
 For his part, Trump also retaliated to this onslaught by aggressively accusing the media of being fake, corrupt, incompetent, and unpatriotic. In light of this ongoing hostility between the two parties, it is unreasonable for the audience to expect sophisticated eloquent debates that are tempered and civilized.
 In our region, our concerns should not be these debates; we must focus more on where each candidate stands on foreign policy matters. The views of a US president can have major implications on the international arena.
 For instance, President George W. Bush decided to invade Iraq on the pretext of spreading democracy in the Middle East, especially troubled regions – claiming that it is the best approach to address issues like poverty, terrorism, and chaos. This decision has entirely reshaped the entire Middle East.

 Squadrons straddles that fine line between arcade style flying and fight simulation-like complexity. It is interesting how you can reroute power to your lasers or your shields or even your engines in the heat of the battle for that added defence or offense. The throttle is easy to use with the left stick, and things like de-accelerating quickly to make tight turns are critical to you not being blown to smithereens. As you play, you unlock the ability to set your own loadouts which is crucial to winning and finding your identity — especially in multi-player.

In fact, it is difficult for small real estate companies such as Nam Tai to obtain bank financing in China. If Nam Tai's Board of Directors were to lose its relationship with Kaisa, which would be the case if IsZo's majority slate of nominees were elected to the Board, the Company would run the risk of loans being canceled, consequently leading to significant liquidity issues with its operating and construction works. Furthermore, the requisition notice and further actions related to a potential change in control pursued by IsZo could trigger an early repayment of outstanding loans demanded by the banks under relevant loan covenants.

I remember that it was maybe the second or third play and he was like, ‘Do you think you’re an actress now?’ Because I kept saying, ‘I’m not an actress. I’m just doing this because I don’t have anything to do.’ That’s all I would say. Because nobody was an actor in Chicago that I knew, in my neighborhood, in the inner city of Chicago. That wasn’t a part of my world.”
 Her first credit is a 1993 episode of “ABC Afterschool Specials,” playing a 16-year-old girl with an abusive boyfriend. Over the next 25 years, she worked steadily with small roles on shows like “NYPD Blue” and “Touched by an Angel” before breaking through with her turn in HBO’s “Six Feet Under” as Vanessa Diaz, the wife of funeral home technician-turned-partner Federico (Freddy Rodriguez).
 “I remember they gave me the pilot script and I was like, ‘Who the hell is going to watch this show?’” Machado says. “I mean, come on, really? I had to be talked into ‘Six Feet Under’? What, am I crazy? I think back now, and it’s like, if I didn’t do ‘Six Feet Under,’ I don’t even think half of the stuff would have happened for me. Not half of the stuff.”
 From there, Machado had memorable turns in “ER,” “Queen of the South” and “Jane the Virgin.” She even starred in the 2010 stage production of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway hit “In the Heights.” She wanted the headlining roles, but she had come to accept that she’d likely always be a supporting player.

That stereo pair will be solely wireless, though, because Google didn't include wired input in the Nest Audio. That's a real shame, because two of these would be great hooked up to a turntable. If you want to make a wired stereo with Google speakers, you'll have to shell out for two Google Home Maxes -- which will run you $598 at retail. Not only is that super expensive, it's also overkill for most rooms, especially smaller ones. By contrast, you can get a two-pack of Nest Audios for a small discount: $179.

“Mort Meisner’s deep-dive behind the scenes of television news during its heyday will shock and surprise,” says Jay Levine, former anchor and chief correspondent for CBS O&O WBBM in Chicago. “This brutally honest portrayal of major market news anchors and reporters, and the culture he describes, replete with troubling examples of racism, sexism, and widespread drug use, makes Meisner more than ‘enough to be dangerous’ to the legacy of television news.”

Should such a company be allowed in Dax?

Recent polls suggest Iowa's Congressional races are neck and neck and President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden were tied at 47 percent in an Iowa Poll released Sept. 22. Trump indicated in late September that if he loses, he won't leave office if he thinks the election wasn't fair.

Those improved drivers coupled with a jump from 300 to 520 cubic centimeters of back volume (the hollow space behind the drivers) mean the Nest Audio can muster a whole lot more _oomph_ than the Google Home could. Google says it can produce 75 percent more volume and 50 percent more bass, and while I have no means of scientifically testing those claims, they sure seem to hold water. This thing gets surprisingly, neighbor-botheringly loud, and the low-end frequency response feels extremely robust compared to the Google Home.

The Lady in The Lake makes for a decent antagonist, but it's not until a black and white episode that some unexpected depth is added to the threat the inhabitants of Bly Manor face. Throw in some solid visuals and the characters whose stories and lives it's easy to get lost in, and _The Haunting of Bly Manor_ is definitely a solid follow-up to _The Haunting of Hill House_ , but not one that comes close to topping it. Neither an overly terrifying experience nor one that will stick with you long after watching, it too often feels directionless, and even a nine-episode season (an episode shorter than the first) feels like it may have been overlong. As exciting as some of the ideas here may be, they're familiar enough that nothing feels overly original, and for some, events are likely to become too difficult and convoluted to follow, while the ending will definitely be a love/hate experience.

Turkey Vultures, however, exclusively feed on carrion, and creatures die year- round, so it isn't a shortage of food that compels tens of thousands of Turkey Vultures from Canada, Washington, Oregon and Northern California to move south into southern California and Mexico.
 Turkey Vultures are actually following the sun on its apparent migration south each winter. These large, kite-like birds head south where the days are still long enough to ensure that there is enough daily solar heating to create the rising updrafts they use to soar, without having to expend energy by flapping their wings.
 These columns of rising warm air, called thermals, are the means that Turkey Vultures use to gain altitude over the landscape below.
 As the vultures pass through our area, any birds still in Tehachapi Valley by late afternoon seek a roost in large trees here for the night, hoping to resume their journey the following morning.
 And although countless people will spot circling Turkey Vultures (a behavior called "kettling") and say "Vultures are circling, there must be something dead," these dark birds don't actually eat at all during their fall migration.
 The Nuwä (Kawaiisu or Paiute) word for Turkey Vulture is wükümahaazi, pronounced wuh-kuh-ma-HAA-zi.
