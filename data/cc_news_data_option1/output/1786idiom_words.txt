I was a high school student when I read “My Left Book,” an autobiography of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. I remember how I was affected by his story, which has now been adapted into a film by Jim Sheridan. Brown can never control his movements. He spends his whole life in a wheelchair. However, he fits into the family thanks to his mother’s insistence. Later on, he discovers that his left foot is unaffected by this paralysis and he clings to life with it in a completely different way. He begins to work on it, and in this way, he reveals the talent hidden in his own soul. His novels and poems, which he wrote using only his left foot, make him one of the most respected figures in Irish literature. The movie was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.
