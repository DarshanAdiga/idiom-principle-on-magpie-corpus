Halloween Havoc returned after 20 years away on Wednesday night, and the guys brought you live commentary of the event every step of the way.

Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal returned! It was definitely a very Halloween-esque show, so it didn't really matter what happened inside the ring because the sweet nostalgia was real.
 But, the in-ring action was pretty good, too.

The oil industry was already struggling before the pandemic struck, with a weakened global economy decreasing demand for energy and producers flooding the market with cheap fuel. Then prices fell well below what producers need to break even. A barrel of the U.S. benchmark crude was selling for about $35 Thursday, and most producers need at least $50 a barrel to make ends meet. As the pandemic gripped the U.S. economy and demand for fuel plummeted, Exxon announced in March that it would cut expenses by 30%.

“All they could get (Tuesday) given the number of people we had here was just their applications to be able to get their ballots,” Richards said. “Our election staff worked long after-hours (Tuesday) to give them a ballot that is specific to them so they can fill it in here and hand it in afterwards.”
 Richards noted the week of remote learning due to new COVID cases on campus may have prompted students to project they would not be able to vote in person the following week.
 Katherman reiterated in a phone conversation that residents can register and vote after 30 days. What happens elsewhere was beyond what he could see. He also refuted talk that votes could be changed after being submitted.
 “Once you have voted with your mail-in ballot or absentee ballot and I have received it, they are finished. There is no do-over and no change,” Katherman said. “The only exception that could possibly happen is if you said, ‘Someone stole my ballot, voted it and mailed it in.’”
 Katherman said fraud of that sort would need to be looked into, but it was unclear by what means.
 Gov. Tom Wolf suggested Wednesday morning that it was too late for voters to mail their ballots with reasonable assurance that they will reach a county election board in time to be counted. He maintained the best way to be assured their ballots would arrive in time would be to bring it personally to their county office.
 On Wednesday afternoon, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to take up a request to roll back the deadline for late-arriving but correctly postmarked ballots to be counted. In doing so, the court upheld counting of ballots through Friday, Nov. 5 in Pennsylvania.
