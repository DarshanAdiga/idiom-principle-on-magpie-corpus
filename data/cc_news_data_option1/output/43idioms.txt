Despite the state's fire season being over, California's main firefighting agency won't for the time being send firefighters to battle the massive wildfires burning in Australia.
 "Having experienced firsthand the devastation that wildfires can create, we share your concern about the wildfires currently ravaging Australia and are closely monitoring the situation," Cal Fire said Friday in a statement posted on Twitter. "While we are ready to lend our support at any moment, it is strategically vital that we do not self-deploy and that we work with the international aide system."
 Cal Fire Capt. Scott McLean said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee the agency would send firefighters to Australia upon receiving a request from the U.S. government, but so far, the feds haven't made that request.

I was driving on Tuscarawas Street W on New Year's Day when I happened to look over and catch a glimpse of the Canton Inn.
   
 You ever see yourself at your worst in the mirror and wonder what the hell happened? That's what happened this time.
   
 Man, what an eyesore.
   
 It got me to thinking, what if the Canton Inn didn't exist? What if we could wave a magic wand and -- poof -- made a change to make Canton better?
   
 And we started with the Canton Inn.
   
 Poof -- gone.
   
 Man, we'd all be better off.
   
 Starting with … property values. I'm serious, this Canton armpit of a hotel is sucking the life out of property values immediately around it. And then the home around those homes, and so forth.
   
 What about police?
   
 Canton police responded to the Canton Inn 155 times in the last year, according to the records department. That doesn't include if there were any last night. Don't laugh, it's probable.
   
 I don't know about you, but the police never had to come to my home. Let's say you have a relative -- we all have that one, right? -- and the police have visited five times over the last 10 years to your home because Uncle Larry is getting crazy again.
   
 155 times in one year to one address?
   
 Razing the Canton Inn would free up police, too.
   
 We shouldn't allow a place like the Canton Inn to stay open any longer. There isn't anything good going on inside, or outside for that matter.
   
 So let's start with knocking down the Canton Inn.
   
 Boom, Canton's better.
   
 Now let's start with slumlords.
   
 I know, we just talked about this last week, but this is going to be an issue this year.
   
 There was a building code problem just before Christmas at a house on Ninth Street NW. The condition of this place -- I've seen pictures -- was atrocious. Frankly, I'm surprised anyone is allowed to rent it.
   
 The floor from the second story was coming through the roof of the first floor in several areas, drywall on an exterior wall in the bathroom was gnarled away, there was at least a 1-inch gap between the door jam and door, allowing cool air to come in, the hinge side of the door was practically rotting away and there was trash all over the floors and in the kitchen sink.
   
 This property owner owns 158 properties in Stark County, most of them in Canton. He is delinquent on property taxes for 55 of those places to the tune of more than $12,000.
   
 Why do we allow this?
   
 The cleanliness of a house falls upon those residing there. The condition of the house, however, falls upon those who own the buildings. And that condition sets the tone for the cleanliness.
   
 Poof! Slumlord properties are gone.
   
 And what's next?
   
 Let's make it easier for the people who have treated the city well in the past and currently to do more business. Let's find ways and funds for people like Steve Coon, Bob Timken and Bob DeHoff to do more business in Canton.
   
 These aren't easy problems to fix. It's a lot easier to write about them in a newspaper column than it is to find way to eradicate the problem.
   
 But if we don't start now, when?

KANSAS CITY -- States can get a substantial return on investment if they help single mothers in college access child care, support services and financial aid, according to a new study from the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
 But even though about 10% of all undergraduates in Kansas and Missouri are single mothers, neither state makes significant investments in helping them persist to graduation, KCUR reports.
 IWPR estimates it would cost between $7,000 and $8,000 per student mother to provide child care while she was enrolled in college, and Kansas and Missouri would get back up to $4.54 per dollar invested in the form of increased tax payments and reduced public assistance benefits after the mothers graduated.
 Victoria Worden didn't have affordable child care when she got pregnant the first time. With no one to watch her daughter while she did schoolwork, she had to drop out of college.
 Now she's trying again, this time with three young children at home.
 "So sometimes I'm typing papers with Disney movies in the background really loud, which is distracting. Sometimes I'm holding a toddler," said Worden, who's working on an associate degree at Metropolitan Community College-Penn Valley. "Sometimes I'll really get on a roll, you know, be doing really well and getting something done finally, and then they'll have a big argument that stops everything."
 Worden isn't alone. Nearly a quarter of all undergraduates in the United States are parents, but it's single mothers who face the steepest odds to get to graduation. Only 8% of single moms in the U.S. earn an associate or bachelor's degree within six years of their first enrollment in college, and the vast majority of them live in or near poverty while in school.
 "Single mothers are very likely to start college but not finish, and I think that speaks to the drive that (they) have," said Lindsey Reichlin Cruse, a study director who manages IWPR's Student Parent Success Initiative. "They know that a college degree is the path out of poverty and into family- sustaining careers, but they're not getting the support they need to be able to finish."
 For Victoria Hammond, a junior at the University of Missouri-Kansas City with two children and another on the way, the difference between having a college degree and not is about $30,000 a year. So she's getting a degree in urban studies to advance her career in youth development.
 "This piece of paper is the thing that will connect me to the next step," said Hammond, who worked with urban youth at the YMCA for many years. "No matter how much experience I have, I'm missing that piece of paper."
 Hammond is getting financial assistance from KC Degrees, a community service organization that provides scholarships to adult students who go back to school to get the credentials they need. But it still isn't easy. Just finding convenient child care has been a struggle. Hammond put her 2-year-old's name down on the waitlist at the Berkley Child and Family Development Center on the UMKC campus when she was seven months pregnant, but a spot hasn't opened up.
 "Accessibility matters. If I'm taking my kids to school and daycare, and myself to school and work, that's four different stops in the morning, and another four in the evening," Hammond said. "I'm making eight trips a day."
 But UMKC has made other changes, like extended library hours, that have really helped Hammond. Sometimes she'll take her 12-year-old daughter with her, and they'll do homework together.
 Worden said in many of her classes, more students have children than don't. When nearly all K-12 students in the metro had an unexpected snow day last week in the middle of finals, one of Worden's professors let her college students submit their written exams online so no one would have to scramble to find child care.
 Worden hopes her daughters, who are 2, 8 and 11, see how hard she's had to work to go back to school.
 "I tell them all the time, 'You see mommy doing this now, and it's so much harder with all of life's responsibilities? I really hope that you guys will do this when you get out of high school,'" she said. "I want them to get it over with before they have their own children."

“Creating effective technology solutions for facilities that don’t have cell phone coverage, nor time on their side, continues to challenge our team,” he said. “However, we take a hands-on approach to understand the workflow — or supply chain — so the workers spend most of their time caring for the animals, while our software solutions focus on collecting the data and finding efficiencies.”
 He added that MetaFarms serves all producers, from small family farms to large, fully integrated producers, and they are motivated every day by the chance to help their customers improve their operations.
 “Like with any business, having the right employees who have a passion for agriculture is our greatest asset,” Parker said adamantly. “We have a great balance of skillsets and knowledge, blending business acumen/operations and technology knowhow with experienced, on-farm pig knowledge resources. I find this balance allows us to challenge the norm, but also keeps our focus where it needs to be — providing sensible solutions.
 “The icing on the cake is hearing from our customers that, ‘This totally makes sense and helps me manage my farm better.’”

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both on board for connecting the camera to your phone, using the free Leica Fotos app for Android and iOS. Unlike the SL, there’s no built-in GPS unit, but images can instead be geo-tagged using GPS data from your phone via the Fotos app. Setup is done entirely using Bluetooth, which makes it particularly straightforward, and the camera can be paired with multiple devices at the same time. You can use your phone as a remote control, complete with live view and the ability to change the most important camera settings, and copy images across for sharing. Unfortunately, I struggled to get this working consistently using either Apple or Android devices, with the app often displaying no photos from the camera. But hopefully Leica can fix this with an update.

If you survived 2019 after your mother or father, spouse, sister or brother, or best friend died, I just want to hug you. You made it through Christmas in spite of finding absolutely no jolly in your holly.
 This was originally a letter I was going to write to my friend, Mike, whose amazing dad died in August. His death was more than untimely -- it was just plain rude. But since then, so many of you have been slapped in the face by the cold hand of fate, that I want to write this to all of you.
 A few weeks ago I ran into my friend, Jeffrey, and I asked how his wife was doing. Lynn's mother had the nerve to die close to the holidays and just before Lynn's birthday. As I commiserated with Jeffrey, I told him that for those of us who lost a loved one, surviving the holidays is like 40 days of crawling through the desert, from Thanksgiving to Christmas. In January, we're still picking sand out of our molars.
 My parents died about two months apart 28 years ago.
 After nearly three decades, I'm not sure it gets better. Doubling up on anti- depressants does not help because there is no prescription for grief. The gaping tear of despair is one wound that time does not heal.
 My family calls it "playing the dead parents card." A year ago on Thanksgiving, our daughter Maggie warned us that she would be spending Christmas with her boyfriend in Detroit. She had a logical and reasonable point about why she should be in Detroit with Vince's family. After she gave her explanation, it was my turn:
 "MY PARENTS ARE DEAD."
 Everything will remind you of them. When I look at our Christmas tree, I remember that every year my parents' biggest fight was about whether the tree was straight. My dad was the prince of perfect ornament placement. His thumbprints were burned off from rearranging the light bulbs so no two red or green lights were next to each other. When I hear Josh Groban promise "I'll Be Home for Christmas," I have to stop myself from thinking of my home on Lynn Street that's been sold, remodeled and re-sold. But changing that thinking is like shifting gears without putting the clutch in first.
 The good news is that our old parents, old friends and the young husbands and wives ripped away too soon become the ghosts of Christmases past and future. They haunt us when we make cranberry sauce. When I put sheets on the bed for company, I hear my mom telling me that the opposite corners of the fitted sheet go on first, and the pattern of the top sheet goes inside. We hear whispers of wisdom when we stand back and make sure the tree is straight.
 The only wisdom I have to share is that I know you can do this.
 When my mom was dying, she told me she worried how I was going to make it, taking care of her -- my best friend -- who was dying a slow death from cancer. I reminded her that I came from a long line of women who were raised to walk through hell and come out smiling.
 One winter when it felt like hell was freezing over, I delivered Mobile Meals to a woman who lived in a gray double-wide on a gravel road. The snowdrifts covered the path to her door. So I waded through snow above my knees, carrying the meal against my coat to keep it warm. And then I fell in the snow, holding the meal above the snow line.
 That is grief. You think you're making progress. You can see the front door. And then you fall flat on your face. But in 2020 we will pick ourselves up and slog onward through the drifts.
 Be kind to yourself. Take baby steps. Take a deep breath. Cry hard. Be pissed at God. You have time to forgive. You don't have to smile. When people ask you how you are doing, just say "OK."
 And I promise you that one day you will laugh again.

In the final minute of the game everyone at Nyewood Lane were wondering how Bognor didn’t take the lead. Efforts from Smith, Aaron Hopkinson, Crane and what seemed like four other players in the space of a matter of seconds somehow couldn’t force the ball home from close range.
 The last kick of the game broke the Rocks' hearts. Monlouis was left unmarked on the edge of the box and curled the ball into the top corner from 20 yards out to take home all three points.
 It was cruel on the Rocks but a second home defeat in four days has done nothing to boost their promotion hopes. They are back in action away to Leatherhead next Saturday.

 Cecil Eugene Nelon August 17, 1917 - January 1, 2020 OKLAHOMA CITY Cecil Eugene Nelon, 102, loved as a father, grandfather, and great grandfather, respected as a CPA and community volunteer, WWII Navy Veteran, and skilled amateur athlete, passed away peacefully on January 1, 2020. He was born on August 17, 1917 near Morris, OK, the son of Thomas F. and Cora Belle Nelon. His dad worked in the oil fields of east central and southeast Oklahoma, so Cecil spent his early childhood years in the countryside near small towns such as Bald Hill, Haskell, Bowlegs, Kight, and Sasakwa. Cecil graduated from Sasakwa High School. In September 1936, Cecil left home and moved to Shawnee to attend Cheatham's Business College. There he met Neata Madelyn Fox, who was taking some courses before she headed off to what was then Oklahoma A&M.; They married on December 16, 1944 and remained married for nearly 68 years until her death in 2012. Cecil served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, spending virtually all of that time on the heavy cruiser USS Pensacola. He enlisted in October 1941. Because his orders after training in San Diego were delayed, he arrived for sea duty at Pearl Harbor on Christmas Eve, a couple of weeks after the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. During his time on board, the USS Pensacola saw action at Bougainville, Midway, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, Tarawa, and the Marshall Islands, among numerous other engagements. The ship was twice hit by Japanese torpedoes. Cecil was a Chief Petty Officer, applying his business skills at what the Navy called a ship's store clerk. In early 1944, Cecil declined an offer to go to officer training and make the Navy a career. He left the Navy in early 1945 after marrying Neata. Cecil and Neata had three children, Robert, now of Oklahoma City; James, now of Woolwich, Maine; and Kathryn, now of San Antonio, Texas. Neata and Cecil lived in Shawnee until they moved in 2001 to Oklahoma City, where they lived until their deaths. After his Navy service, Cecil returned to Shawnee, earned his certificate as a CPA in 1952, and established an accounting practice with Neata's father, Guy Fox. Cecil practiced accounting with various partners through the years in Shawnee until he retired in 1982. Cecil was active in the First Presbyterian Church of Shawnee for many years, serving numerous terms as Elder. He was a long-time member of the Shawnee Kiwanis Club and the Elks Club in Shawnee. He served as President of Shawnee chapters of the Kiwanis Club, the YMCA, and Camp Fire Girls, and as treasurer of the Oklahoma Junior Chamber of Commerce. From the time he was playing in sandlots as a small boy, Cecil loved baseball. In early 1938, while studying at Cheatham's and working at the Shawnee Milling Company, Cecil was spotted by a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies. Cecil signed a contract to play for the Tulsa Oilers, but his professional baseball career was short-lived. He was a right-handed first baseman; at training camp the player/manager wanted a left- handed first baseman (which the manager was himself), and Cecil never got a chance to show his skill. He still played baseball and softball on amateur and semi-pro teams for many years after World War II, and he was a respected little league coach who had a positive influence on many young boys in Shawnee. Cecil was an avid golfer, loved reading newspapers and books, and enjoyed watching sports of all kinds. Cecil was preceded in death by his parents; his wife, Neata; his brother Dale Nelon; and his sisters Gladys Farmer, Polly Patterson, Elena Tuttle, Joann Marquis, and their spouses. He is survived by one sister, Peggy Jackson and her husband, Clint; by his three children Robert D. Nelon and his wife Freddie A., James R. Nelon and his wife Edwina M., and Kathryn E. Loveland; grandchildren Gregory T. Nelon of Oklahoma City, Lindsay Nelon Stout and her husband Eric E. Stout of Plano, Texas, and Mackenzie Loveland Araguz of San Antonio, Texas; greatgrandchildren Sebastian Araguz of San Antonio, Texas, Nelon and Madelyn Stout of Plano, Texas; and a number of nieces and nephews. A service to celebrate Cecil's life will be held on Monday, January 6, 2020, at 1 pm at Covenant Presbyterian Church, 10100 Ridgeview Drive, Oklahoma City. Burial will follow at Resthaven Memorial Park in Shawnee. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in honor of Neata Madelyn Fox Nelon to the Oklahoma Chapter, 6601 Broadway Extension, Suite 120, Oklahoma City, OK 73116. Services are under direction of Walker Funeral Service, Shawnee, OK.

An effort by a court-appointed administrator to help the retailer to correct its mistakes go back to the drawing board for a recovery strategy has totally failed.
 Since early 2018, when the retail chain sought protection from its creditors to try and get a new lease of life, nothing much has happened.
 Its branches in the other EAC member states have been shut and goods seized, as have the majority of its Kenyan outlets.
 In 2017, it had 60 branches, dropping to just six in September 2018.
 A combination of factors, including gross mismanagement, poor strategic decisions, tax issues and massive internal losses perpetrated by wayward employees and suppliers, have been cited as the main reasons behind the death of giant supermarket chain.
 Its rapid expansion compounded its management challenges, thus intensifying internal thefts and collusion with crooked suppliers to force the retailer to its deathbed. Nakumatt's woes mirror those of another major retailer, Uchumi, which has for years struggled to stay afloat.
 The lesson from Nakumatt's collapse is the need for prudent management and monitoring to safeguard investments.
 A forensic audit must now be carried out to establish who did what in the wake of claims of possible culpability by management in the collapse.

Vivemos  numa sociedade democratica plural, onde a Constituiçao Federal garante a igualdade de tratamento a todos. Logo, os diferentes comportamentos humanos devem ser respeitados,  mesmo os daqueles que optam pela diversidade sexual.      Embora  respeitemos a liberdade de opçao de vida de cada um,  o relacionamento interpessoal no campo homoafetivo, por  ser incapaz de produzir o efeito natural da procriaçao humana para a perpetuaçao da especie, deveria ser tratado como uma exceçao a regra da conduta sexual.      De tudo isso, o que nos deixa apreensivo e passar a viver em uma sociedade universal,  onde as novas familias heterodoxas nao tenham mais recato e as inocentes crianças venham a presenciar e praticar cenas homoafetivas.      A preocupaçao com a formaçao moral das crianças tem que ser vista com seriedade. As familias de procedimentos ortodoxos nao podem sofrer interferencias de grupos ideologicos quaisquer para conduzir seus filhos segundo os criterios homoafetivos. A heterossexualidade ha de ser  a regra.      Nao podemos olvidar que a formaçao moral das crianças e uma responsabilidade dos pais. Nem o Estado  nem ninguem podem  induzir a familia a aceitar comportamentos sociais exogenos.      É inaceitavel pretender-se moldar os comportamentos e os costumes da sociedade a maneira  de pensar ou de agir os segmentos sociais minoritarios.      E, nesse mundo virado de cabeça para  baixo, onde a homossexualidade  toma espaço,  como fica a procriaçao humana  para a perpetuaçao da especie? Nao e mais necessaria? Entao, estamos caminhando para o fim da especie humana? Pois, sem relacionamentos heterossexuais nao havera mais vidas.      Assim, aonde iremos chegar com a nova postura comportamental humana? A bom lugar, decerto nao.      O episodio de  Sodoma e Gomorra, segundo relato biblico, nao pode ser esquecido.

I don't think old UPS batteries are going to be very reliable in use. For starters, they were never designed to be discharged more than once in a blue moon.
