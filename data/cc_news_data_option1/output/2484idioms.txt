Enter Kaycee Madu on Wednesday.
 He's Premier Jason Kenney's main man for cities.
 Couldn't pick a better guy. He's called Calgary city council "spending freaks" and he was "infuriated" with the city's current high-tax budget.
 He's perfect to have at the other end of the teeter-totter when local politicians start to play the world's smallest violin.
 Once again, Madu is not singing from the same songsheet as Nenshi.
 Thank God, in this case, Nenshi is all hat, no cattle.
 Madu and Kenney will do what they do and the cities boss knows Albertans can discuss city issues and equalization in the same election.
 We can walk and chew gum at the same time, a feat difficult to handle at city council.
 Madu knows what's up.
 "I have always been clear. Voters are not a nuisance. They ought to be the point of our municipal elections and I would argue anyone running for political office who is afraid of voters is in the wrong business.
 "I hear the mayor of Calgary loud and clear but at the end of the day this is a matter for the provincial government, not for the council in Calgary, to decide.
 "Albertans are fed up with equalization. They want to have their say."
 Yes, a few days back, Nenshi wanted to give somebody a piece of his mind.
 The mayor said the panel members who looked at how to get a fair deal for Alberta and recommended the vote on equalization were apparently stenographers and not experts.
 They took down what people said. Imagine that. For Nenshi, this was "an extremely strange position to take."
 It is reported Nenshi said having the equalization vote along with the city election may be cheaper but democracy isn't always cheap.
 We know this all too well in Calgary. In fact, democracy is never cheap in Calgary. Look at your bills.
 So what is the real reason Nenshi and some other city politicians are upset?
 City hall is afraid. They know having a ballot question on the screwed-up fleecing of Alberta will bring folks out to vote.
 They want a nice quiet election. They do not want angry people out there ready to send a message. They do not want a high turnout.
 The people coming out will not be Nenshi's people and they aren't likely to vote for any seat-warmers sitting on the current F-grade city council.
 To city hall, we are the great unwashed. We're mushrooms, best kept in the dark.
 To them, we're kind of like a public lynch mob. Weren't those the words we heard when rising up against the Bowfort Towers taxpayer-funded ugliness?
 Remember when the former provincial government had to force an Olympic bid plebiscite on city council?
 The Cowtown Kremlin is a well-earned handle.
 And now, with an election not too far down the road, their greatest fear is long lines at polling stations and citizens who can't wait to mark an X.
 Now we just have to give it to them. And Trudeau while we're at it.

If there were ever a metaphor for a neglected petri dish for the novel coronavirus, it's Florida's jails and prisons.
   
 Unlike assisted living facilities, crowded beaches, nursing homes, police- brutality demonstrations and other known COVID-19 hotspots, the virus continues to spread behind bars with far less public fanfare or concern.
   
 In a state that's seeing a surge in coronavirus infections -- 100,000 and counting, according to Florida Department of Health -- the latest count of virus cases behind bars is also on the upswing.
   
 According to the Florida Department of Corrections, there are more than 1,600 cases in 13 "hotspot" facilities. Palm Beach County's South Bay Correctional Facility stands out in particular. More than 215 inmates tested positive for the virus, as have 60 staff members, the highest for any prison in Florida.
   
 The virus continues to spread in county jails, too. As of June, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office reported that 39 inmates at the West Detention Center in Belle Glade and one at the main jail near West Palm Beach had tested positive.
   
 The numbers are small when compared to the general population, but we're still talking about a vulnerable population confined to close quarters -- many from impoverished backgrounds and having underlying health conditions.
   
 Jail and prison officials have taken steps to better sanitize facilities, develop protocols for exposed inmates and staff, ease overcrowding and monitor outbreak. But it's not enough.
   
 "In terms of incarcerated individuals, especially at the outset, I think we were a little behind in taking necessary precautions," said Carey Haughwout, Palm Beach County's Public Defender. "There was a lot of fear from the clients. People are scared who can control their environment. Those who have no control over their environment, it's even more frightening."
   
 For Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose priority has been on re-opening and Florida's economy, addressing the virus hotspots seems more of an afterthought, particularly in county jails and state prisons. It shouldn't take another devastating spike to force the governor to act. With the stroke of a pen, he can order the health and corrections departments to develop a plan to curb COVID-19 by reducing inmate overcrowding, particularly among elderly and non- violent offenders currently stuck behind bars.
   
 State law gives the governor extraordinary power to deal with emergencies. In the current crisis, his executive orders, proclamations and rules have the effect of law. Granted, there is a lot on his plate, but the governor can't overlook the impact on the state if the virus is allowed to fester and grow inside our prisons and jails.
   
 Florida takes its lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key mantra seriously. The state has third largest prison system in the nation: 97,000 inmates and another 167,000 offenders participating in community supervision programs. According to the Prison Policy Initiative think-tank, Florida locks up a higher percentage of its people than several industrial nations, including the United States.
   
 Budget cuts, overcrowding and low pay for corrections officers have plagued prisons for years. In 2018, for example, then-Gov. Rick Scott approved a state budget that left prison funding $28 million short. That forced corrections officials to cut substance abuse and mental health services and eliminate re- entry and work-release programs.
   
 Granted, many in the public feel that efforts to test for and fight the virus should be directed at more deserving communities impacted by the pandemic, like elderly confined in ALFs and nursing homes, low-income urban residents and rural farmworkers.
   
 But Florida can't allow the novel coronavirus to fester in any segment of society, especially those legally confined and all but forgotten. Close quarters, unsanitary conditions and inadequate health care hurt not only inmates but correctional officers, sheriff deputies and prison administrators who go back and forth between jails, prisons and the general population.
   
 What spreads in prison doesn't stay in prison.
   
 To keep all of us safer from the virus, officials must expedite the parole process to allow the release of elderly and non-violent inmates who can be eligible for supervision. Numerous states are taking steps in this direction -- albeit small steps, in most cases -- and Florida should join them.
   
 Many of these ideas aren't new -- just never implemented. State Sen. Jeff Brandes, R.-St. Petersburg, introduced no less than 20 criminal justice reform bills during the last session of the Florida Legislature, including one creating a conditional medical release program. They all died in committee. More recently, the Reform Alliance, a national criminal justice reform group, sent the governor a plan that would reduce state prison population by incorporating new reforms, including suspending arrests for technical violations of supervision.
   
 There isn't any absence of strategies to deal with the virus in Florida's jails and prisons. The problem is the lack of will. The state has the resources to address the problem. It's up to the governor to make it happen.

Due to all of these changes, though, Waste Management likely found this a good chance to come back to the table with a less-appetizing offer. According to the revised terms of the deal, the company will now acquire Advanced Disposal in exchange for $30.30 per unit. This values the firm's equity at $2.73 billion, about $260 million lower than the prior deal called for. Net debt of $1.84 billion brings the total deal value up to about $4.57 billion on an EV basis.
 While some of this purchase price will ultimately be offset by the sale of the aforementioned assets, one thing won't change. Waste Management is still slated to generate at least $100 million in synergies associated with cost- cutting and reduced capex budgeting following the completion of its acquisition. Management actually used the term 'exceed' in reference to this figure, which implies that actual synergies might end up being greater than the company previously anticipated.
 ## Probably a fair deal
 If Waste Management can go on to generate the $100 million in synergies that it's projecting from this acquisition, that could create a lot of value for the business and its shareholders. Fortunately, there's a lot of disparity between the industry behemoth that is Waste Management and the fairly small Advanced Disposal. To understand this, we need only consider the performance of each business relative to the other. To start with, let's address revenue. Over the five years ending in 2019, revenue at Advanced Disposal grew 16.2%, rising from $1.40 billion to $1.62 billion. The waste management space is not growing at any particularly-rapid rate, so Waste Management isn't exactly an all-star of growth, with revenue rising 19.2% over the same time frame.
 Where the difference is really clear is on each firm's bottom line. Over the past five years, Advanced Disposal lost money in 2015, 2016, and 2019. Total losses over that five-year time frame were $22.9 million. By comparison, Waste Management generated profits every year, with aggregate income of $7.48 billion. Fortunately for Advanced Disposal, it did generate positive operating cash flows over the past five years, with aggregate cash flows of $1.38 billion. Waste Management's operating cash flow, meanwhile, totaled $16.16 billion. What's more is the fact that, unlike Advanced Disposal, which saw its cash-flow numbers jump all over the place from year to year, Waste Management's grew every year over this time frame. In 2019 alone, the firm generated operating cash flow of $3.87 billion, up 8.5% compared to the $3.57 billion seen one year earlier.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of laid-off workers who applied for unemployment benefits declined slightly to 1.48 million last week, the 12th straight drop and a sign that layoffs are slowing but are still at a painfully high level.The steady decline in claims suggests that the job market has begun to slowly heal from the pandemic, which shuttered businesses and sent the unemployment rate up to 14.7% in April, its highest level since the Great Depression. The number of people who are receiving jobless aid also fell last week, evidence that employers are rehiring some of the workers who had been laid off since mid-March.Yet the latest figure also coincides with a sudden resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States, especially in the South and West, that’s threatening to derail a nascent economic rebound. On Wednesday, the nation set a record high of new coronavirus cases. Many states are establishing their own records for daily infections, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas and Oklahoma. Cases of coronavirus have also jumped in Florida and Georgia.Should those trends continue, states may reimpose some limits on businesses that would likely trigger job cuts. Whether by choice or by government order, fewer consumers would shop, travel, eat out and visit bars or gyms. All those scenarios would result in renewed layoffs and hinder the economy.Nervous investors sent stock prices plummeting Wednesday over escalating fears that the economy will suffer further damage from the disease.“The health crisis continues to cast a dark shadow over the economic landscape,” said Bob Schwartz, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, a forecasting firm.Before this week’s heightened worries about the pandemic, many economists had been relatively optimistic. In May, the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined, though to a still-high 13.3%. Consumers began spending again, sending retail sales jumping by a record amount. And sales of new homes rose as record-low mortgage rates fueled buyer interest.In May, employers added 2.5 million jobs, a surprise gain. Still, that hiring represented just one-ninth of all the jobs that have been lost since the pandemic struck. And about 30 million Americans remain unemployed.The economy shrank at a 5% annual rate in the first three months of the year, the government estimated Thursday. Yet economists envision a much sharper plunge in the April-June quarter -- a rate of up to 30%, which would be the worst since record-keeping began in 1948. Analysts expect the economy to rebound in the second half of this year before potentially regaining its pre-pandemic level in late 2021 at the earliest.Yet all that assumes that the pandemic doesn’t intensify, force widespread business closures again and set the job market and the economy even further back. If it does, the damage could be dire.For now, real time data on small businesses suggests that the economy’s improvement slowed in June compared with May and then stalled in the past week in some states that had reopened their economies the earliest.Homebase, a company that provides scheduling and time-tracking software to small companies, says the proportion of small businesses that have reopened has leveled off. As of Monday, 78% of U.S. small businesses that it tracks were open, little changed from a week earlier. In Florida and Texas, the proportion of small businesses that have closed has actually risen as a result of the resurgent viral outbreaks.Apple said late Wednesday that it would re-close seven of its stores in the Houston area, which is suffering a spike in cases. Last week, it had said would re-close 11 other stores in four states.Economists at Goldman Sachs have upgraded their economic forecasts for the rest of this year and next year in light of the retail sales gains and other positive data. But they warned that a “significant” second wave of cases this fall that would force business closures could slash growth next year by more than half.For the unemployed, the federal government has been providing $600 in weekly benefits, on top of whatever state jobless aid recipients are receiving. This federal money has pumped nearly $20 billion a week into the economy and enabled many of the unemployed to stay afloat.A majority of recipients are even earning more than they did at their old jobs, raising concerns that this could discourage some of them from returning to work. But the $600 a week in aid will expire after July, and Trump administration officials have said they oppose an extension. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have introduced compromise measures.The $600 a week has been a major help to Alexis O’Neill, who was laid off in March from an accounting job at an aviation fuel company. O’Neill, 49, who lives with her mother in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is looking for a job that would allow her to work from home so she could avoid putting her mother at risk of contracting the virus.She has applied for at least a dozen jobs but has received no responses except an acknowledgement of her application. Many open jobs now seem to offer lower pay than before the pandemic struck. Compounding the dilemma for O’Neill, Michigan is stuck with the nation’s second-highest state unemployment rate, 21.2%.“The job market is terrible,” she said. “Everything either pays so badly or doesn’t come with benefits.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Pinegar monopolized Penn State’s field goal kicking duties during his freshman season, but formed an effective tandem with Stout — a Virginia Tech transfer — a season ago.
 Stout came on to try kicks from distance, with all three of his attempts coming from at least 50 yards out. He connected on two of them, including a 57-yarder against Pitt that tied a school record.
 Pinegar, by comparison, did not try a kick over 50 yards, but went 3-for-3 on kicks from 40-49 yards out, and 4-for-5 on kicks from 30-39 yards.
 Lorig was clear: Though the Nittany Lions turned to Stout last season when they needed power, Pinegar wasn’t far off.
 “Jake can kick the long ones too, just so everybody knows,” Lorig said. “It was kind of neck and neck, and it was like, I think Jordan hit one more than Jake or something, so we said, well, the numbers say this.”
 Pinegar said on Wednesday during a Zoom call with reporters that Lorig held him to a higher standard during his first season in charge of Penn State’s special teams, helping to spark his improvement.
 Part of the rise was natural. Pinegar was able to build on a platform of confidence and comfort.
 “The biggest thing from year one to year two is having experience,” Pinegar said. “It’s hard going out there year one and nailing everything and being totally comfortable in that environment. But, you know, as time goes on, you adapt and you get more comfortable.
 “Year two to year three, the confidence, being comfortable out in that atmosphere, that’s all there. I think a big part of this offseason is kind of correcting the small things in my approach, with my stance, my steps — smoothing things out to where it’s just trying to get more to that muscle memory stage.”
 Pinegar found no problems getting the reps he needed while he was away from his teammates amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 A native of Iowa, Pinegar was able to practice at his high school field just about every day alongside his brother, Hunter, who kicks at Sam Houston State. As for weight training, he found enough equipment in his basement to get by.
 “Obviously with no spring ball, it kind of sucks not being able to get that edge,” Pinegar said. “But I feel, personally, being back home and kicking with my brother, being able to kick with other people quite often played a huge advantage.”
