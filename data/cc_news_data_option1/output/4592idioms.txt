If the majority turn out to be in the latter camp, then the movies really are dead. But if you're in the former camp--if not even the good new movies you watched at home in 2020 felt as "real" to you as they would have in a theater --you're not alone, and your frustration is actually a sign of hope for the future. We can't change the film industry--none of us can get it up and running, robustly, right now.

It seemed to me Chappelle was a bit of the turd in the punchbowl, the kind of Debbie Downer reality check to what the whites & possibly many blacks are feeling. A bit of the "blacks keep whites honest - & stop them from dancing bad" is a bit pretentious, a bit retread dumb. But still, I appreciated that somehow as food for thought - I'm worn out after Trump, and Covid's still raging, so I'm not quite in the dancing on cars mood. That doesn't mean I wholeheartedly agree with Chappelle either - though I do also think some of these things like "Kung Flu" are overblown - the whole "you have to be an X to say something about X" seems sad, so limited. I mean, I'm happy if a non-leper gives me a new leprosy joke, or someone who doesn't suffer from an intestinal disorder gives me some new material for dyspepsia.

Those histories go all the way back to the beginning of the modern American movement for women's political rights. Sojourner Truth represented Black women at the first national women's rights convention in 1850 in Worcester, Mass., and the following year, in her famous "Ain't I a Woman" speech, she laid out the core argument that fueled voting rights activism for decades: that equal access to the ballot is a matter of human rights. After having campaigned for Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant for President in Michigan in 1872, she-- alongside several other suffragists nationwide--tried to vote and got turned away, thus raising awareness of the issue.

Comedians are apologizing because their target audience is essentially booing and walking out. The apology is their attempt to stop that. I don't really follow stand up comedians though I watch a medium amount of their work. What ever comedian gets a deal with the streaming service I'm subscribed to at the moment. I remember the names of those I think are great and forget the names of most of the rest. So I can't really name names and make comparisons. But there are still comedians doing similar schticks to Andrew Dice Clay. I watched at least some of their work though sometimes I just turn them off half way through their set. They're doing fine with their target audience and only get in trouble when they try to expand beyond it. They don't have to apologize. They can say fuck em if they can't take a joke. They can settle for the smaller market that likes their type of humor. They apologize to stop the bleeding and change their routine if they can to appeal to the larger market. Or to hold onto a market that has different standards that have changed over time.

That was among the questions President Donald Trump's policing commission, launched in January, was tasked with answering. This administration being what it is, and these times being what they are, it seems perfectly fitting that the commission itself broke the law — broke it so completely, in fact, that the day before the election a federal judge blocked it from ever releasing its report unless it included glaring language near the top advising readers that the contents were a product of a panel that was unlawfully constituted and operated.                          Or, in the alternative, it can start over, this time with more representative membership and more open proceedings.                          The takeaway is that any discussion in the as-yet unreleased report of the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice about why people don't respect the law is likely to be fairly useless, because it was written for self-serving purposes by police and prosecutors operating behind closed doors without input from people with different experiences and backgrounds, in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.                          That's a shame, because the panel had other questions it was supposedly seeking to answer, and some of them were quite worthy. Such as, "How do mental illness, substance abuse, and homelessness affect the ability of law enforcement to police?" That's a particularly timely question, given that so many cities have responded to a summer of protests by trying to pull their police back from dealing with mental illness, substance abuse and homelessness.                          A responsibly constituted commission might have had much to offer on that question.                          But this was not a responsibly constituted commission. As with so much of Trump's presidential work product, it was an obvious attempt to subvert something from Barack Obama's administration, in this case his Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Some law enforcement officials were upset with the Obama report because it had the temerity to suggest that police ought to do some of their work differently, in the interest of justice and public safety.                          Trump created his commission to reiterate his position that police are doing everything right but are being undermined by troublemakers.                          To ensure a report that made findings in accord with that outlook, Attorney General William Barr stocked the panel with police chiefs, sheriffs, folks from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Marshals Service. There are also civilians — criminal prosecutors, for example, and directors of public safety offices. To be fair, there is one city councilman. No, wait, he's also a cop. No civil rights leaders, community advocates, defense lawyers.                          Presidential commissions are run by and for the benefit of the United States, so they are subject to law, in this case the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which lays out rules to ensure balanced membership and viewpoints and public access to proceedings.                          When Trump announced he was creating the commission, though, he said that recommendations would come quickly "because most of them" — the members — "know many of the answers before they begin." In other words, no need for hearings, fact-finding, evidence, analysis, discussion, debate. This was to be a vehicle for doing what the selected members already wanted done.                          Sure, there are laws that govern these kinds of things. But those kinds of laws are for suckers, right?                          Which should lead us to once again ask the commission's central question:                          Why don't people respect the law?                           _Robert Greene is a Los Angeles Times editorial writer._                          Careers Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie Policy                          Contact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give Feedback                          Subscribe Today Newsletters Facebook Twitter E-Edition                          Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Pay Your Ad Bill Reviewed.com 10Best Reach Local                          © 2020 www.milforddailynews.com.

What's more, Apple is going to continue to sell Intel-based versions of the Mac mini and the 13-inch MacBook Pro for the time being, alongside the new M1 versions. Only the MacBook Air is completely switching to Apple silicon right now.
 Developers will also need to recode their applications to run properly on the new processors designed by Apple – Adobe Photoshop, for example, won't be fully optimized until next year. The roll out of macOS Big Sur should help here, which Apple says will happen from November 12.
 As for the details of the actual hardware itself, the designs are staying just about the same but the insides are getting upgrades. The new M1-powered Mac mini is apparently up to 3x faster than the 2018 edition, with pricing on the product starting at US$699.
 The updated MacBook Air ditches the fan thanks to the low-power demands of the M1 chip, and according to Apple can reach 3.5x performance gains over the previous edition. Pricing on the new laptop starts at $999, with up to 18 hours of video playback possible between battery charges.
 Finally the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 chip inside will start at $1,299. Apple says it offers a 2.8x performance increase over the current entry-level model in the series, with a single battery charge lasting for up to 20 hours of video playback.
 All these new computers are available to preorder now, with shipping and store availability on November 17. Apple says that within two years, every computer in its line-up will have made the switch to Apple silicon.
