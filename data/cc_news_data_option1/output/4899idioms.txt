Il Covid, purtroppo, ha alleggerito le tredicesime di tanti dipendenti del settore privato. Dall’inizio dell’emergenza, infatti, almeno 6,6 milioni di lavoratori sono finiti in cassa integrazione e molti di questi a zero ore. Questa situazione non ha consentito a tante persone di maturare il rateo mensile che definisce economicamente la gratifica, alleggerendone quindi l’importo finale di circa 100 euro per ogni mese di indennità ricevuta. Con meno soldi a disposizione e tanta sfiducia che assilla le famiglie italiane, gli acquisti di Natale rischiano di subire una contrazione fino al 15 per cento. Se l’anno scorso la spesa complessiva ha sfiorato i 10 miliardi di euro, quest’anno potrebbe scendere a 8,5-9 miliardi, una riduzione che rischia di penalizzare soprattutto le botteghe artigiane e i negozi di vicinato che faticano a reggere la concorrenza sempre più spietata del commercio on line».

The International Cricket Council's newly-elected chairman Greg Barclay on Monday conceded that the ambitious World Test Championship hasn't quite achieved what it intended to and the disruption caused by COVID-19 has only highlighted its "shortcomings".
 The World Test Championship schedule has been thrown haywire by the andemic and the ICC has come up with a percentage allocation of points as all the scheduled series before the 2021 final at the Lord's cannot be completed in a short span of time.
 Has the Test Championship given the format a fillip that it was meant to? "In short, I don't think so. The COVID has probably highlighted its shortcomings of the championship," Barclay, who took charge earlier this month, said during a virtual media conference for wire services.
 The New Zealander feels that a lot of problems with the current cricketing calendar is due to the World Test Championship which was fitted in to popularise the format, something that didn't happen, according to him.
   
   
 "...the issues that we have already got, I wonder whether some of it was because of an attempt to develop a Test Championship, clearly designed to drive interest back into Test cricket, provide a bit of context and relevance around the Test matches," he said.
 While it was good in theory but has probably flopped in practice.
 "From an idealist's point of view, probably it had a lot of merit but practically, I do disagree, I am not sure whether it has achieved what it intended to do," he said.
 In fact, Barclay dropped a hint that the inaugural WTC could well be the last one as smaller members can't afford Test cricket championship anymore.
 "My personal view is let's get through with the little bit that we can in this COVID-19, with reallocation of points and all that.
 "...but once we have done that, let's go back to the drawing board as I am not quite sure whether it (WTC) entirely fits the purpose and has achieved what it intended to after being conceptualised four to five years back.
 "I think we need to look at it in context of calendar and not put cricketers in a situation where it's a lot more worse and not going to help us," the New Zealand lawyer asserted.
 He revealed that he does have support among some full member nations on the matter.
 "Yeah, I think there would be some countries. It is difficult for some of the full members as they simply can't afford to play Test cricket.
 "Test cricket has got its legacy and I am a purist but I do accept that as much as I want to keep it as it is, less and less countries are able to afford that arrangement and are able to play it.
 "Very few countries can make it work from a financial point of view," Barclay spoke about the crux of the matter.
 Calling himself a realist, he agreed that the current calendar needs a revamp.
 While he believes that T20 leagues are here to stay as they assist the financial health of the member boards, he wants bilateral series with context as players' safety as well as physical and mental health will be paramount in coming days.
 "My view is that, I think all forms of cricket need to be taken into account. You are right, the calender is increasingly becoming congested and something has to give in somewhere." It is a sort of compromise that member nations need to strike.
 "...but I do respect that each country has the right to develop its own domestic league given it meets the ICC requirements and is properly sanctioned," he said.
 "Clearly there is a demand from the playing point of view and commercial partnering perspective. So let's accept that domestic leagues are here to stay and they have been tremendously contributing to the growth of the really exciting product like the IPL, BBL and CPL." For him, bilateral events should have a context and profile. "...it's an incredibly difficult juggling act to get in there and also, we need to have enough conversations regarding players' health safety. I don't think we have had enough conversations.
 "Some of the focus needs to be on the integrity aspect of the game and we need to have competitions which are relevant and have context." Barclay also made it clear that he would like the ICC to maintain its elite standard of competitions when asked about having extra events, which the world body had informally proposed only to be rejected by members.
 "Bilateral cricket is fundamentally important to member countries. ICC runs very, very good events, all countries must have an opportunity to take part in these events.
 "I am a fan of maintaining ICC events which are world class but at the same time, giving an opportunity to members to have bilateral cricket." While making it clear that he would like to see a lot of Indo-Pak bilateral cricket, he maintained that it's "not his mandate" and he understands that there are "geo-political" considerations in play.
 About India's "blow hot blow cold" relations with the ICC, Barclay said that everyone acknowledges the importance of a strong member board like the BCCI.
 "India is a massively important part of world cricket. Like all families, we have general squabbles but India recognises that ICC needs Indian cricket. We have been able to navigate through differences if any."

The Bank of England is seeing old fault lines open up as officials lock horns on whether to take interest rates below zero for the first time.That's what the math on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee is starting to look like, as the so-called "internals" on the panel with full- time operational roles at the central bank show the greatest signs of resistance to the measure. The minority of part-time "external" officials tend to be more open to subzero policy."There is a split in the MPC between internals and externals on negative rates, and I think that has been a key factor in the Bank of England's delay in additional stimulus," said Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a former BOE official.Those lines of disagreement help explain the institution's slow-paced approach to subzero rates in the intellectual battle over how to aid Britain's devastated economy beyond the current stimulus. While all agree the measure should be in the toolbox, and have done for months, the BOE has postponed a decision by ordering a study into the finance industry's preparedness for such a policy.Dave Ramsden, who as deputy governor for markets and banking would be pivotal in any change, has urged caution, playing down the possibility that it could be imminent and citing the need to engage with banks.Governor Andrew Bailey, the public face of the institution, has sounded similar notes, wondering if computer systems can handle negative figures. Deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe have likewise expressed caution, while even Chief Economist Andy Haldane, a perennial wildcard, insists time is needed to study the matter.That's left the externals, especially those from academia, as the most supportive voices. Silvana Tenreyro and Jonathan Haskel have both cited research showing the policy is effective elsewhere. Gertjan Vlieghe has said going below zero isn't counterproductive, and officials should try to increase headroom for action.The BOE avoided following the European Central Bank into negative rates amid concerns at the loss of profitability to banks that they would inflict. But with the benchmark now at an all-time low of 0.1% to aid the economy, quantitative easing in full flow, and post-Brexit trade relations about to set in, it was maybe inevitable the policy would be reconsidered.Investors have dramatically reduced bets on negative rates in recent months. They are no longer pricing in a cut below zero in 2021, having previously seen such a move in the first half of that year.An MPC split between the two classes of officials wouldn't necessarily center on the need for more stimulus, but it would be a rift that hasn't been seen in a while. Andrew Sentance says the panel had more such disagreements when he served on it from 2006 to 2011."There have been various times, in the late 1990s and when myself and Danny Blanchflower were on the committee, that the external members exercised quite a striking difference in opinion," he said in an interview.If the split does harden between the two groups, the impression of an institution shunning the views of outsiders could become sensitive for the BOE, which has been accused of "groupthink" and being too conservative.Such a confrontation would echo an argument earlier this decade on whether corporate bond purchases could become part of QE. "The bank executive closed ranks on this one particular issue," former external member Adam Posen told lawmakers in 2013. Officials might each still have valid reasons to stand against such a policy however."The internal members have got different constituencies to an extent, in terms of financial stability concerns, operational concerns, political concerns perhaps," said Chris Hare, an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc and a former BOE official. "You could imagine a pretty substantial degree of wariness about negative rates over and above the externals, who maybe have a bit more of a free rein to talk about the macro theory side of things."Still, if the externals want to push their point against the internals over negative rates, they may need courage, according to Sentance, who says taking on the institution's heavyweights isn't for the faint-hearted."You have to be quite brave to set yourself in the minority," he said. "It's not difficult, you just have to be willing to do it. You have to be brave and coherent.
