In the wake of the Covid cases that have rocked the Ireland soccer squad around their international triple-header in recent days, Maher points to the personal responsibility that is on the shoulders of players to ensure that the championships get the green light and stay going.
 “We always talk about the inter-county bubble over the years," he said.
 “You're really getting into that bubble now, where you go to training and you get home, and you do your day to day work, and that’s as much as it is, unfortunately.
 "You see the scenario with Fermanagh now. It’s absolutely not beyond the realms of possibility it could happen to Tipperary.
 “It could happen to any county, and not because of anything, it's just with the scenario we are in and the world we are living in it can happen based on a simple contact you've come across through work, or wherever it may be.
 “We are very much aware of it and we are trying to be as safe as we can. In fairness, the set up we have for training, and the environment that’s been created, you would feel very safe going into training, with the protocols that are in place.
 “Nobody feels like, 'Oh, we shouldn't be doing this or doing this'. That’s credit to the county board, management and the backroom team that are supporting us.
 “I feel safe going in on a Tuesday night for training. Everything is laid out for you. You get your temperature check and you are wearing your face mask, and you get in.
 “You're there for the bare minimum, to put on the boots and it’s up to the pitch straight away.
 “It’s a new environment, it’s a new way of training, it's a new approach, but it’s still as enjoyable as ever.
 “When you get onto the pitch it’s still the same game, the same approach - that’s the most enjoyable part.
 "The other stuff that has to happen before and after, absolutely willing to do as much as we need to do and as best we can to make sure we don’t compromise anyone within the group or anyone around the community."

I have no doubt that, ultimately, Aer Lingus will refund in cash or via voucher all the hundreds of thousands of passengers still out of pocket having been stranded by the virus. And I will say that the airline has been active in engaging with cases that I have personally raised with them. But neither they, nor I, would argue that this is the way a refund/voucher scheme should operate.

To The Daily Sun,
 On Oct 7, Senator Chris Coons (D-Del) reported on his meeting with Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. He made a point of saying that he never questioned her faith but he did ask her “…whether she’s someone who believes in a living Constitution or in originalism, …”. This struck a note with me because I have heard the discussion on several occasions about whether or not our Constitution is a “living” document. It appears that many people feel our Constitution should morph or be considered in light of how we are living our lives today.
 If we feel our Constitution should be changed, we have a process in place to do that. Three-fourths of both houses must propose the amendment and it must be ratified by two-thirds of the states or vice versa. Or it may be ratified by special convention in three-fourths of the states. This is a fair and equitable method for all Americans.

NEW BEDFORD -- Carrie Hawthorne found herself running through the Buttonwood Park Zoo hysterically laughing with her daughter and the rest of her team as they were trying to "escape" the zoo before time ran out.
 As education curator for the zoo, Hawthorne was testing out a new program at the zoo, Deja Zoo -- Escape Experience, before it was offered to the public.
 The zoo began offering the after-hours program in September, according to Hawthorne, to teams of up to 10 players at a cost of $300.
 The teams that schedule an escape experience are first met by an animal ambassador when they enter the zoo and can learn a little bit about the animal as they wait for their entire group to arrive.
 The team then has full rein of the zoo -- as long as they stay together as a group -- to solve a series of puzzles, unlock boxes, and find things throughout the zoo all before the 90-minute time limit runs out, according to Hawthorne.
 The team is able to beat the clock by solving all the necessary clues to open a lock box containing a timer that they have to shut off, Hawthorne explained.
 All throughout the experience participants will learn about conservation and the zoo's animals.
 Since the program started in September, Hawthorne said the zoo has scheduled an average of two escape experiences a week.
 The zoo staff had been toying around with the idea of escape experience for a while, Hawthorne said, but never had the time to focus on it before.
 The coronavirus pandemic provided that time, especially as they've been trying to find ways to make the zoo accessible to people in different ways.
 "One thing we're discovering is that some people don't feel comfortable being at the zoo when it's open to the public," Hawthorne said, so offering them the opportunity to come and have the zoo to themselves for a few hours has been appealing.
 In addition to the escape experience, the zoo is also offering private after- hours zoo tours for groups of 10 or less with each tour costing $350 and lasting two hours.
 The group has a tour guide and is able to interact with some of the keepers and animals along the way.
 Hawthorne said it's a nice laid back way to see the zoo when you don't feel comfortable being there with other groups of people.
 The zoo has scheduled an average of one private zoo tour per week since September, Hawthorne said.
 Both programs have attracted people looking to celebrate special occasions like birthdays, according to Hawthorne who said booking a private experience at the zoo can be a special thing to do at a time when large parties are discouraged.
 The after-hours programs have allowed the zoo to use their staff in a fun way and bring in some revenue, Hawthorne said.
 Testing out the escape experience was even something different for Hawthorne who has worked at the zoo for six years.
 "I've never experienced the zoo in that way," she said.
 The response to the escape experience has been very positive, Hawthorne said, with many groups that have gone through it saying they would come back to do it again if the zoo staff developed new clues and puzzles.
 Hawthorne said the zoo staff is constantly thinking of alternate forms of revenue, but it's difficult since state guidelines are constantly changing.
 Since they're never sure what the next mandate will bring, they also continue to work on virtual programming.
 The zoo does plan to hold its popular BOO at the Zoo! program but, like regular admittance to the zoo, they will be offering a limited number of timed admission tickets due to the pandemic.
 The zoo staff is in the process of developing ways to hand out candy that are socially distant, including using shoots, and have socially distant activities for children like obstacle course.
 One thing will be the same as every year though, Hawthorne said, the zoo will be beautifully decorated.

Where other nursing homes have given up explaining a reality the residents will quickly forget, Grafton County Nursing Home has adopted a policy of relentless explaining. Staff will describe the pandemic as many times as residents ask about it, which is often multiple times a day.
 “We’re trying to get the resident to understand why the door is closed and why need to take these precautions,” he said.
 Labore said, for the time being, the home cannot accept as many new residents as before the pandemic. Isolating those with cognitive impairments, which is about 80% of their residents, is just too resource-intensive.
 As cold and flu season approaches, a runny nose could put a nurse out of work for days while awaiting the results from a COVID-19 test, quickly throwing the isolation unit into a state of disarray.
 “It only takes two or three call-outs to throw staffing into a bad spot,” he said.
 He has heard of other nursing homes that have stopped accepting new admissions altogether.
 Labore feels for the residents in isolation. Transitioning to life at a nursing home is hard without masks and days spent alone in a room.
 “If you put yourself in the shoes of someone with cognitive impairment, seeing someone come in dressed in full (personal protective equipment) is a totally different experience,” he said.
 For the most part, Patricia Cummings, an administrator at the Edgewood Centre, has been surprised by how well residents with dementia have adjusted to the new realities of COVID-19.
 When walking through the dementia unit a couple of days ago, she worried what the residents would make of someone walking through in a blue plastic isolation gown.
 “I love what you’re wearing!” one of the residents said.
 When Cummings asks residents to wear a mask because of “the virus,” most of the residents happily comply. She suspects these precautions aren’t wholly unfamiliar to her residents who likely lived through infectious disease outbreaks like Polio.
 Maryann Blanchard said she is making the most of the situation, but there are some things she misses about visiting her husband.
 She misses walking him down to his room after lunch, tucking him into bed, and turning on classical music for his afternoon nap. She misses bringing him homemade food they could eat together in the facility’s dining room.
 “We want to hold each others’ hands, give each other hugs,” she said. “We are the ones that keep our people stimulated to who they are. We help them with their memories.”

The judges noted a very Hamilton vibe to the character and his clues, so we immediately thought of Leslie Odom Jr. and Christopher Jackson. Now, we feel like it is actually the former that is donning the costume. Although Jackson could be a potential candidate, it was the '31118' clue (given in the sneak peek before the show started airing) that sealed the deal. It was reported that Leslie Odom Jr. has released three albums and has been a part of 11 theatrical productions. Plus, he has performed on Broadway for 18 years, from 1998 to 2016.
