In part one of this two-part series, we had emphasised that the large contribution of nominal interests pose a challenge to debt management in India.


  One problem with using aggregate data on public debt means that we can't exploit the maturity structure of debt and its impact on the interest rate component. It should be pointed out however that any debt-decomposition analysis using aggregate debt has an important ...

  As I have told my faithful readers for years, I have never cooked a recipe from Ina Garten that was not delicious, unique and perfect. The following recipe is no exception.


  The croque monsieur is a baked or fried ham and cheese sandwich. That seems so simplistic. But when you top with a lovely Gruyere and Parmesan cheese sauce, bake and then broil - this is SO much more than a plain ham and cheese sandwich. A nice side of frites (or French) fries sprinkled with sea salt and thyme completed the meal.


  If you have leftover ham during the holiday season, don't just make a boring ham and cheese for your friends. Wow them with this version!


  CROQUE MONSIEUR   • 2 tablespoons unsalted butter   • 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour   • 2 cups hot milk   • 1 teaspoon kosher salt   • 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   • A pinch of nutmeg   • 12 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated (5 cups)   • 2 cup freshly grated Parmesan   • 16 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed (I left mine on)   • Dijon mustard   • 8 ounces baked Virginia ham, sliced, but not paper-thin


  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.


  Melt the butter over low heat in a small saucepan and add the flour all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes. Slowly pour the hot milk into the butter-flour mixture and cook, continually whisking, until the sauce is thickened. Off the heat, add the salt, pepper, nutmeg, cup grated Gruyere and the Parmesan, and set aside.


  To toast the bread, place the slices on 2 baking sheets and bake for 5 minutes. Turn each piece and bake for another 2 minutes, until toasted.


  Lightly brush half the toasted pieces of bread with mustard, add a slice of ham to each, and sprinkle with half the remaining Gruyere. Top with another piece of toasted bread. Slather the tops with the cheese sauce, sprinkle with the remaining Gruyere, and bake the sandwiches for 5 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the topping is bubbly and lightly browned. Serve hot.


  FRITES   Yes, these shoestring potatoes are frites. What makes these little potatoes so special is the two-step frying process.   I usually allow one potato per person and then add one extra potato. Peel the potatoes and slice lengthwise about an inch thick. Then cut the slices into- inch wide pieces and soak in ice water for 15 minutes.


  In a deep fryer or a large saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil to a temperature of 325 degrees. Drain the potatoes and blot them completely dry.


  Divide the potatoes into batches and fry each bath until cooked but not browned. This will usually take 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to paper towels to drain.


  Reheat the oil to 375 degrees. Fry the potatoes (in batches) until crisp and golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the frites to a fresh paper towel to drain.


  Season with sea salt and a sprinkle of dried thyme. Serve immediately.   - From Ina Garten's \"Barefoot in Paris\"   Laura Tolbert, also known as Fleur de Lolly, has been sharing recipes, table decor ideas and advice for fellow foodies and novices on her blog, fleurdelolly.blogspot.com for more than eight years.

Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder is relishing the prospect of “game- changer” Lys Mousset’s return to fitness.


  The French forward, United’s top scorer last season as the club marked their first Premier League campaign for 12 years with a ninth-placed finish, has been out since suffering a rare toe injury in pre-season.


  He has resumed training ahead of schedule and may play a part on Saturday night against fellow strugglers West Brom, with the Blades still looking for their first win of the season.


  “He has been a huge miss for us,” said Wilder. “He was outstanding since his transfer last season and he’s a game-changer. He’s got raw pace and offers something out of the ordinary.


  “We are looking for game-changers in the group. One of my criticisms is that we’ve not taken big chances and delivered in big moments, to change tight games. And Lys comes into that game-changer category and we’re delighted to have him back.


  “It’s a huge boost for us. I think you saw the effect of John Fleck in the team on Sunday on everyone around him. It’s been the same with Lys, he’s lifted the place and we want all our big players back. He’s certainly a big player for us.”


  The Blades were a revelation last season but have struggled so far this campaign, with Wilder’s team bottom of the table with only one point from nine matches.


  A combination of factors, chiefly the absence of defender Jack O’Connell to injury, has nullified the effectiveness of United’s innovative 3-5-2 formation – which took them close to qualifying for Europe last season, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.


  A growing number of Blades fans believe Wilder should consider adapting their approach, perhaps to a back four, in light of the loss of O’Connell.


  However, the United boss maintains his belief in what they are doing, saying: “We believe in it, it’s worked for me for a long period of time.


  “We’re always assessing and analysing and we have to believe that the next game is the one that turns it around. I don’t believe a wrecking ball is needed.


  “It might be if we were all over the place and getting beat three or four. But if we’d have won the game on Sunday (against West Ham) I don’t think people would have been scratching their heads.”


  The Blades have fitness concerns over Enda Stevens and one other player, who Wilder declined to name, ahead of the trip to the Hawthorns to face West Brom – the team immediately above United in the table.

Bars are really problematic. I have to tell you, if you look at some of the outbreaks that we've seen, it's when people go into bars, crowded bars. You know, I used to go to a bar. I used to like to sit at a bar and grab a hamburger and a beer. But when you're at a bar, people are leaning over your shoulder to get a drink, people next to each other like this. It's kind of fun because it's social, but it's not fun when this virus is in the air. So I would think that if there's anything you want to clamp down on for the time being, it's bars.

Es que hay más información? ¿Es que no resultó tan grave como se esperaba a partir de las experiencias en otros continentes?


  En declaraciones a Radio Sarandí, el psiquiatra Ricardo Bernardi lo analizó así: "¿Qué es lo que está detrás de la fatiga? ¿Negación de riesgo? ¿Cómo se percibe el riesgo y qué se está haciendo para enfrentarlo? Hay que investigarlo"


  Bernardi es integrante del Grupo Asesor Científico Honorario (GACH) que emite informes para que el gobierno tome decisiones respecto a medidas sanitarias para prevenir la expansión del coronavirus.


  "Ahora bajó el miedo y bajó el cuidado", aseguró. "Estamos todos a la espera de la vacuna. Pero por unos meses dependemos de lo que se llaman medidas no farmacológicas, la vacuna ahora son las medidas que tomemos",


  El médico psiquiatra dijo que Uruguay todavía no llegó la pandemia en sus crudos términos como ha ocurrido en otros países.


  "Tiene que haber alerta, nos estamos yendo para la banquina. No estamos más en el medio de la carretera, estamos pegaditos a la banquina"


  Bernardi sugirió que sería interesante crear un observatorio del comportamiento de los uruguayos en relación a la pandemia y al cuidado.


  "Llevamos ocho meses con el cuento del pastor mentiroso", pero es porque "acá todavía no vino la pandemia como sí ocurrió en otros países". "Pensamos que no viene el lobo, pero no dice lo mismo un médico en España, por ejemplo", agregó.


  Bernardi nació en 1942.


  Fue medalla de oro a la mejor escolaridad de la generación 1969 y obtuvo el título de Especialista en Psiquiatría (Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR).


  Es Máster en Psicoanálisis (Asociación Psicoanalítica del Uruguay, miembro de la International _Psychoanalytic Association_ ) y Doctor en Psicología (Universidad de Buenos Aires).

Moreover, even in our physical bodies, the social circuitry of our nervous system belies the billiard ball model of the human being. For example, as Guy Claxton relates in Intelligence in the Flesh, if you and I were in conversation, we would be in a subtle physical dance by which each of us makes internal maps of the other. If you smile, mirror neurons in me are likely to curve my lips. If you pick up a glass of water, a signal registers in my brain, priming me to do the same. We’re mostly unconscious of these relational affects, which tells us that when it comes to estimating our impact on others, we don’t have a conscious clue as to how thoroughly we’re interconnected.

"It's just become a tradition around here," continued the Pulaski County head football coach. "This is the game of the year during the regular season, and it's the game of the year during the playoffs. We're just used to playing twice a year, and it's usually for a district or regional championship."


  That's true. Both Pulaski County and Southwestern have been the class of their respective district in Class 5 A for the past several seasons, and nothing changed about that fact in 2020.


  As with any good football rivalry, the numbers speak for themselves, and when it comes to the Pulaski County-Southwestern football rivalry, there are plenty of numbers to digest.


  Pulaski County had a three-game playoff winning streak against Southwestern snapped last season, with a first-round, 17-7 loss to the Warriors at PC Field.


  Prior to that PC loss a year ago, the Maroons had defeated the Warriors in 2014, 2016, and 2018 in regional title games.


  Tonight, the 9-1 Warriors will try to make it two playoff wins in a row over a Pulaski County team that is 8-1 on the season, riding an eight-game winning streak, and is a perfect, 3-0 this season at the friendly confines of PC Field.


  Oh yeah, one more thing Pulaski County has going for it tonight. The reason this game this evening is a PC Field is thanks to a Maroon, 15-12 victory at Southwestern back on October 23rd -- the Warriors lone loss of the season.


  Again, this is a matchup of two very good football teams that are both evenly matched, which is the basis for Hines saying he saw this game coming before the season ever began.


  In fact, these two teams are so close, that thanks to PC's win earlier this season, the Maroons now led the all-time series over Southwestern by a slim, 17-16 margin.


  "We knew this game was going to happen," stated Hines. "When we got the OK back in July or early-August that football was actually going to happen in this crazy Covid year, you knew, I knew, and Southwestern knew in the back of all of our minds that this game as going to happen."


  "The only question mark was where was it going to be played -- down there or over here," added the Maroons head coach. "We were able to win that game, so we get to play for a district championship at home. It's no surprise. We all knew it was coming, so you put it on the back burner and move on down the road and you now look up and, here you are."

“Though we understand how complex the political situation may be, we ask the international community, including the EU, to give a proactive contribution to the peace negotiations and to ease the humanitarian corridors so that aids can be freely supplied to over four million people in urgent need”: Ethiopia is worrying the European Commission Justitia et Pax, which makes an appeal today, based on evidence found by members of the Ethiopian Commission.

Those who stay are facing the risk of impending famine, because the region, already scantily fertile due to draught and swarms of locusts is now having supplies stopped and is running out of fuel”. “It’s painful to listen to such kind of stories in this day and age”, says the message, which expresses sympathy with the operators of Justitia et Pax who are working amidst such sufferings.

Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch will welcome their first child next month. It's an exciting time for the couple who met while working with WWE. Lynch went on leave following WWE Money In The Bank earlier this year, while Rollins wrestled his final match until at least January this past Sunday night at Survivor Series. The couple will welcome their child in Rollins' hometown of Davenport, Iowa.


  Rollins provided an update on his fiance while speaking with the WWE Network recently.


  He said, "She's doing really well. Our due date is fast approaching. It's crazy to think we'll be parents soon. I'm sure she's ready to get back to work just like we all are. But yeah, she's been so incredible through the entire pregnancy."


  You can see the clip below.


  Rollins also spoke about how ironically the COVID-19 pandemic has benefited him during this time, allowing him to spend more time with Lynch due to WWE's lighter schedule.


  "In our regular WWE schedule, we're always traveling and never get to be home," Rollins said. "And with my fiance's pregnancy, I've been able to spend a lot of time at home with her. I wouldn't have been able to do this on our regular schedule."


  He continued, "The timing of that worked out really well. It's a nice break for me both physically and mentally."


  He went on to talk about the benefits of working in the ThunderDome during the pandemic.


  "The ThunderDome has been great. I was excited from the get-go even though some people were skeptical. For me, we had worn out welcome at the WWE Performance Center. That [arena] was just too small for the WWE," said Rollins.


  He continued, "And that's not a negative thing. It's just that our shows are so big and we needed to be able to go out there in front of a live audience to some extent, have pyro, and it feels like a WWE Raw or PPV show. The PC were a great host to us and we're thankful to them, but I'm so grateful to the Amway Center in Orlando to allow us to come in and create ThunderDome. It's been a blast."

According to the survey, President Nana Akufo-Addo would win the 2020 elections by 51.7 percent.      She said in Twi that the number five means victory because the name Jesus has five letters.      She added that: “David killed Goliath in the Bible with five stones and the figure is five”, making five an enviable position on the ballot paper.      Madam Donkor recalled that in the 2016 elections, then-candidate Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party was on the fifth position and he won so she is convinced her position on the ballot paper would win her the election on December 7, 2020.

The Union governments fiscal deficit further widened to Rs 9.53 lakh crore, which is nearly 120% of the annual budget estimate, at the end of October of the current financial year, according to official data released on Friday. The deficit widened mainly on account of poor revenue realisation. The lockdown imposed to curb spreading of coronavirus infections had significantly impacted business activities and in turn contributed to sluggish revenue realisation. The fiscal deficit at the end of September 2020 was about 114.8 per cent of the annual budget estimate. In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit stood at Rs 9,53,154 crore at October-end, which is 119.7 per cent of the annual budget estimates, as per the data released by the Controller General of Accounts (CGA). In the first seven months of 2019-20, the deficit was at 102.4 per cent of the annual target. The fiscal deficit, or gap between the expenditure and revenue, had breached the annual target in July this year. The government received Rs 7,08,300 crore -- which is 31.54 per cent of 2020-21 budget estimate of total receipts -- up to October. It comprised Rs 5,75,697 crore of tax revenue (net to centre), Rs 1,16,206 crore of non-tax revenue and Rs 16,397 crore of non-debt capital receipts. Non-debt capital receipts consist of recovery of loans of Rs 10,218 crore and disinvestment proceeds to the tune of Rs 6,179 crore. Total receipts in the April-October period of 2019-20 was nearly 45 per cent of the annual target. In the current financial year, Rs 2,97,174 crore was transferred to state governments as part of devolution of share of taxes by the Union government till the end of October. The amount under devolution was Rs 69,697 crore lower compared to the year-ago period. Till October of the current fiscal, total expenditure incurred by the Centre was Rs 16,61,454 crore -- which is 54.61 per cent of 2020-21 budget estimate. Out of the total amount, Rs 14,64,099 crore was on revenue account and Rs 1,97,355 crore on capital account, as per the data. Out of the total revenue expenditure, Rs 3,33,456 crore was from interest payments and Rs 1,85,400 crore on account of major subsidies. For this financial year, the government had pegged the fiscal deficit at Rs 7.96 lakh crore or 3.5 per cent of the GDP in the budget which was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February 2020. These figures, however, may have to be revised significantly in view of the economic disruptions created by the outbreak of the coronavirus. Fiscal deficit had soared to a seven-year high of 4.6 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019-20, mainly due to poor revenue realisation.

With the last passing rays of light, I glimpsed a lone bird. I knew it was now or never. Slipping off the safety of the old shotgun, I lead the bird, and squeezed the trigger. BOOOMMM! The coot folded in a cloud of feathers and splashed down in the middle of the pond.


  Unloading the shotgun and leaning it against the fork of a large willow, I waded in and began the icy trip to retrieve the coot.


  I hurried to the center of the pond. All of the walking and running in the old hip boots really increased the size of the pin holes. They were flat out holes!


  Rushing against the flow of icy water into my boots, I picked up the coot and turned to make a dash back to the bank. Sloshing through the quarry pond, I heard a noise in the distance. Honk, Hoonkkk, Hoooonk! Glancing toward the horizon, I stopped dead in my tracks. Rapidly dropping from the sky was one of the largest flocks of Canada Geese I had ever seen.


  Knowing the slightest move would send the flock careening away, I decided to bend over and look like a stump. With my head down, I held as still as possible as the great flock readied to land.


  The ruse worked. I froze stump-like, and the flock continued to descend! It suddenly dawned on me… what exactly is the plan? My gun was 60 feet away! And, then they were on me, and I do mean… THEY WERE ON ME!


  The sound of the wind passing through the feathers of the huge flock became a muffled roar like an approaching whirlwind. Cupping and flapping their wings, the geese began to hit the water around me. I could feel the wind from their wings and the feathers almost brushed my hunkered torso.


  Although some were within grabbing distance, I opted for a mad dash for the bank. I would quickly load my shotgun, wheel around, and bring down a goose for the Thanksgiving table.


  As I straightened up, the airborne geese saw my white face peering through the dim light. A flock leader sounded a warning, and geese were going everywhere… up… down… sideways… landing… taking off!


  Stumbling around, I felt great wings beating within inches of my head and shoulders as goose after goose passed over me.


  Racing for the bank, I grabbed the 16-gauge, slapped the two remaining shells back in the magazine, and cycled the bolt.


  Whipping around, I flipped off the safety, and looked across the pond! Only tiny ripples were where there had been a couple hundred geese. Faintly, I could hear the flock as they winged their way to safety somewhere far away in Decatur County.


  ‘till next time,


  Jack

  While many of the runners were veterans, there was at least one athlete running the Manchester course for the first time.


  “I just moved her from Phoenix and my finance talked me into it,” Ashley Schroeder said. “I said all right, lives give it a whirl.”

  “All I know that there’s a really big hill,” Schroeder said.


  Jesse Burke of Coventry said he had another motive for competing, besides maintaining a tradition.


  “I need to burn off 500 calories before I stuff myself with turkey,” Jesse Burke of Coventry said. “I do this every year and I think it’s one of the safest things I can do. I’ll be so slow, they’ll be plenty of distance between myself and anyone else.”


  Jaclyn Sullivan of Lisbon said there was still plenty of on course camaraderie, even though there were fewer people surrounding the course than usual


  “Everyone was honking their horns and waving and saying ‘good job,’” Sullivan said. “The true diehards came out — a small crowd, not a big crowd — but it was great.”


  The Malone family of Highland Street was watching from the safety of their front porch, but left a table filled with beverages on the side of the road. It was one of the most popular spots in town.


  Nick Magani of Lisbon said there’s nothing like the actual Manchester course.


  “You can run around your house for 4.78 miles but it isn’t the same as going up and down that giant hill,” Magani said. “It was still a great experience, even though it wasn’t the same as it always is.”


  Some runners carried flags. Some were in costume. All were happy they came to a race that was canceled and they were able to uncancel it.


  And the few hundred runners who decided to do what they always do grabbed another memory along the way.


  “Everyone is going to remember the COVID year,” said Bob Kania of New Britain, who was wearing his 1969 Pulaski state championship cross-country jacket. “They’ll remembered going into Manchester on Thanksgiving and having it deserted.”


  Not exactly deserted — not to the people who decided to brave bad weather and a bad virus so they could have 4.7484 miles of normal.

  # Lot J development heads into pivotal week for Jacksonville City Council


  David Bauerlein


  Florida Times-Union


  The Jacksonville City Council's judgment on the Lot J development proposed by Jaguars owner Shad Khan could come to a head in the coming week when meetings are on tap for the Downtown Investment Authority and City Council on back-to- back days.


  The DIA board is scheduled to meet Wednesday for a session when the agency's board will vote on recommending approval, denial or approval with conditions for the redevelopment agreement between the city and the private development team of Khan and The Cordish Companies.


  The DIA board's recommendation then would go to the Jacksonville City Council when it meets Thursday for a session that potentially could see the council vote on advancing the bill to a final up-or-down decision at the Dec. 8 council meeting, its last regular meeting this year.


  If the legislation does get a green light to take the next step forward, it would require a two-thirds super-majority vote of council at the Dec. 8 meeting to pass the bill because it involves changing the city's capital improvement program.


  Mayor Lenny Curry, who negotiated the deal with Khan and Cordish Companies, tweeted Tuesday that the council should "stop stalling" and making speeches so the deal can get a vote in December.


  Curry said some council members who oppose the deal just want to drag out the process into 2021 so they won't have to cast a vote.


  City Council President Tommy Hazouri, who has criticized the terms of the redevelopment agreement, said Curry is trying to pressure council members by "putting us on the clock."


  Hazouri said he is "all for" Khan's concept for the Lot J development, but he thinks Curry's team negotiated a deal that loads too much of the financial risk and burden on the city.


  "I put it all on the shoulders of poor negotiations on the part of the city," Hazouri said. "It's typical of the way they do business."


  Council voted Tuesday in favor of having the DIA examine the proposed legislation and all the documents connected to it so DIA can give its evaluation of the redevelopment agreement requiring up to $233 million in taxpayer investments and incentives.


  The City Council blocked council member Matt Carlucci's attempts to have DIA step in as the new negotiators for the city. Council also thwarted Carlucci's attempt to require DIA to conduct an independent market analysis of the Lot J project's likelihood of long-term success.


  When the DIA board meets in a special board meeting at 2 p.m. Wednesday, it will review the legislation (2020-648) as well as reports by the City Council Auditor and the most recently revised redevelopment agreement and related contracts.


  The next day, City Council is scheduled to meet at 10 a.m. Thursday for its third formal meeting since Nov. 3 on the legislation. If a majority of council members are ready to send the legislation to the a final vote on Dec. 8, they could take that action.


  Hazouri said that in the run-up to the Thursday meeting, City Council auditor Kim Taylor needs enough time to review the development agreement and other documents that have been going through revisions based on comments raised by her office and council members.


  "They are complicated documents," Taylor said at the Tuesday meeting. "I want to make sure we have the time at this office to do a good job for the council."


  Paul Harden, an attorney representing the Jaguars, has said the team would like to have the legislation voted on before the end of the year. He told council Tuesday the developers accepted most of the auditor's recommendations.


  The Jacksonville Civic Council, which is an organization of business and civic leaders, and OurJax have said city officials should ensure the deal is not rushed toward a vote. Curry has said in media interviews that council isn't being rushed.


  "It's in the legislative body now, and they'll take their time and do the work they need to do, as they should," Curry said in a Nov. 18 interview with WJXT-TV Channel 4 news.


  Hazouri said Curry's tweets Tuesday night contradicted what he's been saying about giving council time to do its review.


  "He can't have it both ways," Hazouri said. "I don't think he understands or respects the role of a legislative body like the council, and this to me is unsafe at any speed until we get the answers in a timely fashion."


  The meeting Thursday will show whether 10 council members are ready to move forward on the legislation. If the number of council members is 13 or higher in support of heading to a final vote on Dec. 8, that would show the deal has a strong likelihood of getting approved.

  Speaking on Friday, lawmaker Ha Tae-Keung did not say when the hacking occurred or which drug companies were targeted, but confirmed North Korea had made attempts to hack South Korean pharmaceutical companies that are developing local vaccines for the coronavirus.

  State Police Chief Loknath Behera transferred Grade ASI Gopakumar to Kerala Armed Police (KAP) 5th Battalion in Kuttikkanam, Idukki, with immediate effect, pending enquiry. The controversy sparked outrage after a video clip that the complainant, Sudevan of Pallivetta, had recorded on his mobile phone circulated on the social media.


  With the State Police Chief flagging the incident as one “that has tarnished the image of the Police Department” in his order, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Thiruvananthapuram Range, Sanjaykumar Gurudin, was tasked with conducting an enquiry on the issue. Mr. Gurudin, who examined the controversy and has collected relevant statements, is expected to submit his findings on Saturday.


  According to official sources, Sudevan had initially petitioned the Neyyar Dam police four days ago after his elder daughter had gone missing. However, the police subsequently traced her and discovered that she had eloped with a man. While the issue was soon settled in the presence of Sudevan, police officers in the station claimed that the complainant turned up again on Friday purportedly under the influence of alcohol and abused the personnel there. They accused Sudevan of instigating them on purpose with an intention to portray them in bad light.


  However, Sudevan said he had gone to the police station in connection with his complaint, but was treated in an undignified manner. Despite being a teetotaller, he was accused of being a drunkard, he claimed.


  Speaking to media persons, he added that no other officer, including the sub- inspector, attempted to dissuade the ASI from insulting him in front of his daughter. Other residents of his locality also raised similar allegations against the officer with a few even accusing him of having used casteist slurs against them.

Truth is, early 2021 will likely mean staying close to home and domestic travel, and hopefully – things have to get better, right? – more trips abroad by summer or fall.
