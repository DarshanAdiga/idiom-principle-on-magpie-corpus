With its live performance of _Winterland: A Discoteque Cabaret_  scheduled to start on December 2, the company called up realtor Mike Viehmann. With him, they toured several spaces and eventually were drawn to the former art studio of Ed Dwight, at 3824 Dahlia Street. Dwight was the first Black astronaut and also a major Denver sculptor who'd worked out of the space since the late '90s; he was recently honored by the Bonfils-Stanton Foundation for his contributions to the arts in Denver. Wonderbound struck a deal with the building's owners, Adam Riddle and Zvi Rudawsky, and soon after, began moving in.
 "It's wonderful," Fay says of the building. "It's an amazing space. It's got Ed Dwight's soul in it. It's got art breathing in the building."
