According to advanced readings from CME Group for JPY futures markets, investors added around 88.6K contracts to their open interest positions on Wednesday, reaching the second build in a row. On the other hand, volume extended the decline for yet another session, now by around 88.5K contracts. USD/JPY seen side-lined for the time being Alternating risk appetite trends continue to rule the price action around USD/JPY, motivating the current rangebound theme to prevail for some more time. Wednesday's increase in open interest in the Japanese safe haven allows for the continuation of the upside, although the persistent decline in volume hints at the likeliness that extra gains look limited.

On his second day as the New Hanover County Schools Interim Superintendent, Del Burns was introduced to many community concerns in a five hour long Board of Education meeting on Tuesday night.
   
 The meeting included a lengthy Call to the Audience, which included 21 individuals, a two hour long closed session and the hiring of three administrators.
   
 The New Hanover baseball team, dressed in orange jerseys and khakis, postponed its season opener to attend the meeting in support of coach Richard Foy, who resigned last week after a three-month paid suspension. He was charged with assault on a female on school grounds, but his case in court transitioned into a deferred prosecution agreement, with a final court appearance scheduled for December.
   
 Among a large crowd of orange shirts, 10 people spoke on behalf of reinstating Foy. After the closed session, the board announced that Foy remains an employee of the district. His current employment status is suspension without pay effective through the end of the 2019-2020 school year. A statement later released by the district said that "coach Foy is in agreement with this action."
   
 "Resignations have to be accepted and processed before they are effective," Burns said.
   
 After the announcement of Foy's status, the board approved the hiring of Ann Gibson as the chief communications officer, Anthony Manzo as the interim director of human resources and Bryan Martin as the interim human resources investigator.
   
 Burns said there were two vacancies: the assistant superintendent of human resources and the director of human resources. The interim investigator will use one of those spots. Burns said that in the interim he will serve in the role of assistant superintendent of human resources.
   
 In addition to those in attendance supporting Foy, individuals spoke out on issues such as student safety, sexual abuse concerns and the background checks process for both school volunteers and employees.
   
 "Their concerns are sincere and heartfelt," Burns said. "I have got a lot to learn. This is my second day on the job. I have seen a lot of great things in the district and I appreciate them voicing their concerns."
   
 Laney graduate Chris Sutton urged the board to take action on the petition he created to have former deputy superintendent Ricky Holliday's name removed from the Laney football stadium. The board discussed Policy 5400, the naming of school system facilities.
   
 According to the policy, the school board has the ability to rename a facility at any time, but must follow the same process as naming one. The policy reads that "a facility may not be named for a current employee; one year must expire after a person's employment ends before a draft proposal may come before the Board requesting a facility be named after the employee."
   
 The board decided to further review the policy and consider a revision in order to address the matter.
   
 "The raw truth of it is that I am hurt," Sutton said. "I came here on behalf of a lot of these victims, and truth be told they don't have a voice for themselves. They were standing in the back when I did my speech earlier as well. And at the end of the day, justice didn't prevail today. They had the power. All it would have taken was one of them to initiate a vote today and everybody could have voted."

To review, the school district wants to build a new $65 million. 147,000-square-foot school to ease overcrowding in the district’s existing middle schools. No one is arguing the need for a new school. It’s where the district wants to build it that is raising hackles of borough Clifton officials and residents.
 That’s because the school district proposed to plop the edifice down smack in the middle of Clifton Heights’ beloved athletic fields, off Springfield Road. For many in the borough, this is considered hallowed ground, the scene of countless youth sporting events and community gatherings such as the annual Fourth of July celebration. It’s also the last bit of open, green space in the borough.
 The hitch is the borough doesn’t own the land, the school district does. And they insist that no other location could handle the size of the proposed school, let alone the added cost acquiring a new site would entail.
 Speaking of costs, school district officials are not thrilled with the delays they’ve encountered, saying they are racking up as much as $20,000 to $30,000 a month in legal fees, while the project itself is now already a year behind schedule. It was first proposed in 2019, with the hope that it would be completed in time for the 2022 school year.
 Since a single shovel has yet to go in the ground, clearly that’s not going to happen. The school district also points out the delays mean they are on the hook for increased construction costs.
 The blame game did not sit well with borough officials, in particular Mayor Joe Lombardo, an ardent foe of the plan.
 “They are trying to intimidate us and it isn’t going to work,” an angry Lombardo said. “We have done nothing to block them. The district has been trying to jam things down our throat.”
 The borough is completely within its rights to make sure the school district is doing everything by the book.

“Con la Compagnia Nazionale di Danza Storica – afferma Nino Graziano Luca - abbiamo ideato il progetto La Primavera vien danzando che oltre l’attesissimo Gran Ballo di Primavera al Palazzo Rospigliosi (in cui saranno protagoniste le nostre coreografie più amate), prevede il giorno prima uno Stage Teorico Pratico di danze e musiche nate alla fine dell’ottocento e divenute popolari all’inizio del novecento quando, ai grandi cambiamenti sociali, si accompagnò anche nella danza uno spiccato senso di libertà e la voglia di sperimentare nuovi ritmi. All’inizio di questa nuova fase, uomini e donne (anche coloro che non avevano mai preso una lezione di danza) ballavano senza l’aiuto dei maestri anche perchè non c’erano coreografie da rispettare. Scott Joplin con le sue composizioni dallo spiccato carattere sincopato ed il suo celeberrimo Maple Leaf Rag, segnarono l'ascesa del ragtime che, dopo una prima fase esclusivamente afroamericana, visse una seconda fase contraddistinta dall’affermarsi di musicisti bianchi che proposero composizioni dalle sonorità più occidentali. Fu in questo periodo che il Ragtime venne riorganizzato con dei ballerini professionisti che, avendo voglia di portarlo sui palcoscenici, crearono coreografie che indussero a standardizzare passi e figure. Tra il 1910 ed il 1920 anche gli appassionati preferirono per le sale da ballo uno stile codificato ma adatto a tutti. Il nuovo Carnet de Bal prevedeva: Valzer, Maxixe, Tango Parisien, Cakewalk ed infine il Foxtrot che ne riassumeva le peculiarità di ciascuna di esse. Noi della Compagnia Nazionale di Danza Storica ci concentreremo su queste danze, insieme ad uno dei nostri Principal Teacher, Daniel La Penna”.

 Behind the scenes in several local non-profits and government type offices, you will find older adults making a difference in our communities. Some are volunteers, but many are being retrained to get the job skills they need to find employment through programs like the Experience Works' Senior Community Service Employment Program. As they build confidence and recent work experience, their efforts provide much-needed help to nonprofits that might otherwise be possible.
 I know firsthand about the Experience Works' SCSEP because I'm currently enrolled in the program. A few years ago, health issues took me out of the workforce before I was ready. As my health got better, I quickly realized that being older with no recent work history decreased my job opportunities. I needed be able to meet some of my medical expenses and as a previous workaholic, I needed to feel productive again.
 I was familiar with Experience Works' SCSEP and connected with Employment and Training Coordinator Liz Cox. As a former director of a nonprofit, I had worked with the program before as a Host Agency. During that time, I helped participants learn new skills and gain confidence through their training assignment at my organization. Now, the shoe was on the other foot -I was the one who needed retraining!
 I was eager to learn new skills, especially working on a computer. I'm moving along in my training assignment with a local nonprofit. I love going to training every day! I love meeting new people and learning new things, plus the bonus is that I am earning minimum wage with part-time hours -less stress and more productivity! With all this help, I know I'll be able to find employment soon!
 Now for the reason I'm telling my story. If you're 55 or older, unemployed with limited or no income, you might qualify for this wonderful program. It's helped me so much and I think it can help you too! For more information please call Liz Cox at Experience Works, 325 203 0536 or visit www.experienceworks.org.

In the video, Brent Miles, chief marketing officer for NorthPoint, praised the way city, county and company officials have approached the project.
 “This is one of the best communities I’ve ever encountered,” he said.
 The video also pointed to improvements downtown, from the opening of the expanded theater complex to the relocation of MSB Architects to a former fire station and the opening of Cannon Coffee.
 The video showed interview clips with Chris and Lindsay Reese, owners of Cannon Coffee.
 Chris Reese pointed to further developments, including the increasing presence of students downtown because of expansions at the University System of Maryland at Hagerstown and the Barbara Ingram School for the Arts.
 “There’s just a lot of great things happening,” he said.
 After the video that reviewed 2019, Mayor Bob Bruchey said “2020 is shaping up to raise that bar even higher.”
 “We have our challenges, no doubt,” he said.
 At the same time, he praised the work of the Hagerstown Police Department in trying to stem crime.
 The morning session was hosted by the Washington County Chamber of Commerce. After the video and some opening remarks, Bruchey and council members fielded questions.
 Officials were asked what they are tackling now that would have an impact 10 years down the road.

They also point out that while the school district talks about “branding” and has hired an image consultant to shape public opinion on the project, they have not hiring a separate project manager.
 Lombardo said the borough’s traffic study – something that ranks high on residents’ fears about the project – is incomplete, as is a “laundry list” of items the borough has asked the school district to address.
 “It is not our responsibility to hold their hand and tell them what they should do,” the mayor said. “They need to present a plan that works for our municipality within our guidelines as far as our building codes are concerned.”
 The only thing that is clear is that the school district is intent on building on the Springfield Road site.
 “We continue to move ahead despite roadblocks and plan on building a school there,” said Andrew Stoll, a land development who is representing the district in the project.
 Both sides in this impasse have legitimate points. This very likely will be the largest construction project in the borough’s history. During school hours it will inflate the borough’s population by 20 percent. It likely will add upwards of 1,000 cars a day into what is now a densely populated residential neighborhood. Clifton Heights is right to hold the school district to the letter of the law.
 John McBlain, the former County Council chairman and special counsel hired by the borough, also bristles at the image being portrayed by the district that the borough is obstructing the process.
 “Contrary to what the district wants the public to believe, the borough has acted in good faith in evaluating the proposed land development plans,” McBlain said.
 So what’s next? It’s likely the two sides will wind up in court, meaning more legal fees for all involved. The two sides have been involved in mediation, but it seems unlikely that process is likely to settle this tug-of-war.
 Meanwhile, the school district will be back before borough planners in March, at which time they would like to play the video for interested borough officials and residents.
 Get your popcorn ready.

Stop touching your face. I mean it! Stop. Touching. Your. Face.
   
 Did you just touch your face? You probably did. I'd bet 82% of readers have touched their face since beginning this column.
   
 I know this because it's almost impossible for average people to go half a minute without wiping their eyes, their nose or their mouth, without scratching their cheek, their brow or their chin, without indulging in compulsive hand-to-face behaviors that remind us we're not that far removed from the chimpanzees.
   
 OK, I exaggerate. According to one study, the average person touches his/her face 23 times an hour, which is only every 2.6 minutes.
   
 If you've been paying attention to the coronavirus news, then you know that there are a couple of things you, as a concerned citizen, can do to diminish the risk of catching this global killer.
   
 The first is to wash your hands, thoroughly and often. Sing "Happy Birthday" two times through before you stop. Don't forget your fingernails. Don't dry on that dirty towel.
   
 The other top preventive measure? The one that's less familiar and so much harder? Stop touching your face.
   
 The edict on face-touching shouldn't be hard to obey. And yet it is. It's like hearing, "Don't think of an elephant." Or, if you're me, it's like hearing, "Don't eat all the M&Ms; in the bag." Tell me not to do it, and reflexively I will.
   
 I'm a face-toucher in any season -- I cup my chin when I'm thinking, I wipe my eyes, I rub my nose -- but it's only now, in the rat-a-tat-tat of coronavirus warnings, that I've become self-conscious about it.
   
 At least I'm in good company, which I know because on Friday I saw a CNN video clip of former Vice President Joe Biden talking about the virus. Twice, within a minute or so, he brushed the area above his lip with a forefinger, first the right forefinger, then the left. His rhetoric was good, but his body language called for instant quarantine.
   
 Not touching your face isn't a novel health warning. It's a standard admonition when we talk of ways to prevent colds and the flu. But it's rarely issued as loudly as it has been in the days since it became clear that the coronavirus has jumped American borders.
   
 When you start thinking about not touching your face, you begin to think of all the things you touch before your hands make it to your face. Filthy door handles, gross elevator buttons, gooey turnstiles, germ-encrusted bus poles.
   
 Long before we'd heard of the coronavirus, I'd trained myself to negotiate those surfaces whenever possible with my elbows, knuckles or forearms instead of my palms or fingertips. Even so, in a coronavirus age, that doesn't seem safe enough. Some invisible scourge could easily make it onto your hands.
   
 So how to stop face-touching? The internet offers various primers, some of them created for teenagers with acne, but the principles apply to coronavirus prevention, too. Unfortunately, these tips aren't as easy to follow as they sound.
   
 Keep your hands busy. OK, I'm doing that right now -- I'm typing. And yet somehow my chin just wound up cupped in my hand while my index finger rubbed the side of my face. And who knows what toxin lives on this keyboard.
   
 Substitute touching your face with another behavior. Like what? Eating more M&Ms;?
   
 Wear gloves. Nope.
   
 Sit on your hands while you're sitting. Not a useful tip for people who earn their living writing.
   
 Identify your triggers to help you anticipate temptation. If you touch your face when you're stressed or anxious, meditate. My inner chimp just made me wipe my eyes after reading about stress. But ommm.
   
 Post notes reminding yourself not to touch your face -- on your computer, your desk, in the car.
   
 Hmm. That may be worth a try because, really, we need to stop touching our faces. My inner chimp will try if yours will. Good luck.
