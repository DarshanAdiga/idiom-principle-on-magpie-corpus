Teenage Manchester City striker Liam Delap said that being named in the starting lineup for Thursday’s League Cup clash against AFC Bournemouth caught him off guard, but he would be smiling for weeks after marking his senior debut with a goal in their 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium. “It was a bit of a shock to be put in the starting line up, but I took it with a pinch of salt and just worked my hardest,” the 17-year-old told BBC. “I was buzzing to get the call up and to top it with a goal, I can’t ask for much more.”

Former Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has agreed to help Argentina in the Rugby Championship, the South American side said yesterday, putting him in competition with his old team. Los Pumas said that Cheika, who quit after the Wallabies’ World Cup quarter-final loss to England last year, would work as an external adviser during the tournament in Australia. “We started talking with Michael at the beginning of the year,” Argentina coach Mario Ledesma said in a statement. “I suggested to him the idea of working together again and he was immediately interested... He has always been very fond of Argentine rugby.”
