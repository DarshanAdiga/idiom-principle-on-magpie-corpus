Premier League chief executive Richard Masters insists there is “no beef” with the EFL’s clubs after Project Big Picture plans endorsed by its chairman Rick Parry were rejected by top-flight teams.
 The relationship between the competitions was strained to say the least when the PBP proposals became public knowledge at the weekend.
 They were developed by Liverpool and Manchester United and, while they included an immediate £250million bailout for the EFL and a 25 per cent share for the league every year in any future Premier League media revenues, they also sought to concentrate Premier League power in the hands of the so-called ‘big six’.
 Premier League clubs did not endorse PBP when they met on Wednesday, and they will instead continue work on a “strategic plan” involving all 20 teams. They also agreed to offer an additional £50million in grants and loans to clubs in League One and Two on top of £27.2m already advanced in solidarity payments.
 The Premier League’s offer will now be formally submitted to the EFL for approval, and while Masters said there was “frustration” that Parry had publicly endorsed the PBP plans, the relationship between the leagues would endure.
 “Clearly there’s some frustration a proposal that hadn’t had any input from the Premier League, from our clubs, has been pushed so hard in public,” he said.

Studies suggest that 6-15 percent of the American Jewish community are people of color, though definitions of who is included under that term vary. Though Jewish organizations have begun paying attention to diversity in their ranks, particularly in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, Jews of color continue to be few and far between in Jewish organizations, especially in leadership roles. In June, three Jewish activists of color organized an open letter calling on Jewish organizations to endorse the Black Lives Matter movement and set specific benchmarks to increase diversity.
 “Our vision of Jewish communities as thriving hubs of innovation relies on bold leadership on a systemic level–and we see that leadership falling short of empowering the full diversity of our communities,” said Danielle Natelson, a design strategist at UpStart.

Haslam, who had burned through three sets of coaches and general managers since purchasing the team in 2012, replaced a top DePodesta lieutenant, Sashi Brown, with a traditionalist general manager, John Dorsey, late in the 2017 season. Dorsey selected Baker Mayfield with the top pick in the 2018 draft, acquired Odell Beckham Jr. in a trade with the New York Giants, and made other moves that signaled a shift in the team’s priorities from “win in some far- flung future” to “win soon.”
 Describing what happened next in a few sentences would be like trying to summarize the French Revolution on a cocktail napkin. After a rolling series of boardroom clashes, Jackson was fired, Dorsey gained greater control of football operations, DePodesta donned a phantom mask and disappeared into the rafters, and inexperienced Freddie Kitchen rose from obscurity to become the Browns' offensive play caller midway through the 2018 season.
 Kitchens' brief tenure unfolded like the sequence in a campus comedy where the lads of Alpha Kappa Chugga lock the dean in his closet and declare every week to be Greek Week. Having finished the 2018 season with a 5-2 hot streak and after earning a little too much preseason hype, the Browns played as if they expected to reach the playoffs through sheer talent and rebellious swagger.
 They went 6-10 instead, as Kitchens committed basic strategic blunders, Beckham and Myles Garrett got into on-field altercations with opponents, and Mayfield regressed at quarterback while publicly feuding with the local and national news media. Few teams have ever allowed so little success to go so completely to their heads.
 Kitchens and Dorsey were fired at the end of the 2019 season, with DePodesta reappearing from a trap door beneath the stage to introduce yet another cast of characters, led by general manager Andrew Berry and coach Kevin Stefanski.
 Superficially, the latest leadership change looks like the result of another boardroom coup, with DePodesta ousting Dorsey’s royalists and inserting inexperienced, analytics-friendly functionaries with scanty résumés in their place. But the newcomers appear more committed to winning games than engaging in thought experiments: They acquired veteran talent in their first offseason instead of using last year’s “Animal House” shenanigans as justification for another “Moneyball”-themed roster purge. Analytics now operate under the hood for the Browns instead of flapping like a flag mounted from the car’s antenna.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said there’s an “orange cloud” hanging over Barrett’s nomination — a political jab at Trump’s tan and a reference to the president’s oft-stated wish to overturn “Obamacare.”
 Barrett told senators she is not “hostile” to the law and promised to consider all arguments.
 Republicans played down the threat to the health law posed by the court case. "This hearing has been more about Obamacare than it has you,'' said the committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Barrett. He added: "Obamacare is on the ballot'' next month.
 Republicans object to the health law because "it was written and passed on a partisan line,'' Graham said. "Most big changes in society have more buy-in (from the public and the two political parties) than that. You’re talking about one-fifth of the American economy.''
 Still, Graham and other Republicans stressed that even if parts of the law are struck down, important aspects such as coverage for preexisting conditions could still be preserved, under a concept known as severability. "The doctrine of severability presumes — and its goal is — to preserve (key parts of) the statute if that is possible,'' Graham said.
 Barrett agreed, saying, "The presumption is always in favor of severability.''
 Republicans have introduced bills to protect Americans with preexisting conditions and bring down drug prices, said Sen Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. "And if we act, (voters) don’t have to worry about you doing away with preexisting conditions in some future case down the road,'' he told Barrett.
 ##  NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW
 On another issue where Trump’s views and tweets are well-known, Barrett declined to say whether a president can pardon himself. But she said she agrees no one is above the law.

CHAMPAIGN -- The University of Illinois football team appears poised to make a statement in the Big Ten Conference. And coach Lovie Smith sees no reason why his team can't.
   
 Coming off their first bowl game in five years, the Illini boast an experienced lineup and a big addition on offense.
   
 "We made progress last year and we are building on that this year," Smith said. "This is the best football team we've had since I've been here. I really like where we are right now."
   
 Smith comes into his fifth season at Illinois with a 15-34 record and 8-28 in the conference. But the Illini were more competitive last season, finishing 6-7 overall (4-5 Big Ten) after losing to California in the Redbox Bowl.
   
 One reason is quarterback Brandon Peters, who started after transferring from Michigan. He is Illinois' first returning No. 1 QB since 2016.
   
 Peters, who missed two games last season with concussions, completed 55.3% of his passes for 1,884 yards. He threw for 18 touchdowns and was intercepted eight times.
   
 "It's been pretty comfortable this year, having that experience last year," Peters said. "There's always moving parts, but overall things are the same for the most part. All of us being on the same page is a huge plus."
   
 He has an experienced group of receivers, with Josh Imatorbhebhe, Danny Navarro and Daniel Barker combining for 78 receptions in 2019. Newly activated tight end Luke Ford, a Georgia transfer, is expected to play a major role in the passing game as well.
   
 The Illini are scheduled to open the season with a Friday night game at Wisconsin on Oct. 23. Last year, James McCourt kicked a 39-yard field as time expired and the Illini pulled a huge upset and knocked off No. 6 Wisconsin 24-23. Illinois' Tony Adams picked off a pass at midfield with 2 minutes 33 seconds remaining, who were 30 ½-point underdogs, to set up the winning drive.
   
 The run game
   
 Illinois is counting on junior Mike Epstein to stay healthy and help carry the load at running back. He had season-ending injuries each of his three years, including one to the knee in the 2019 opener against Akron.
   
 Last year's leading rushers -- Reggie Corbin and Dre Brown -- are gone. And Re'Von Bonner has chosen to sit out the current season because of concerns over COVID-19. Backing up Epstein will be Western Michigan transfer Chase Brown.
   
 Getting defensive
   
 Linebacker Jake Hansen is back to lead the defense. He was tops in the nation with seven forced fumbles despite missing four games due to injury as a junior last season. Linebacker Milo Eifler added 10 tackles for loss in his first season at Illinois after transferring from Washington.
   
 The Illini also have three starters back in their secondary, including cornerbacks Nate Hobbs and Marquez Beason -- who missed last season with a torn ACL.
   
 Built Ford tough
   
 Tight end Luke Ford is drawing quite a bit of attention in Champaign this year. And it's not just because of his 6-foot-6 frame.
   
 A top recruit out of Carterville High School in southern Illinois, he's back playing in his home state after transferring from Georgia. Ford appeared in just nine games and caught one pass for the Bulldogs as a freshman in 2018. But the Illini hope he can deliver in a big way for them.
   
 "I have high expectations because I know what I'm capable of and I know what I can do," Ford said. "And I know that even though I sat out a year, I'll still be able to come in and hopefully be able to make an impact."
   
 Virus update
   
 Illinois has not released any information about the number of COVID-19 cases within the football program.
   
 "We have a protocol we feel real good about," Smith said. "We don't have any issues. All our guys were practicing for the most part. Our guys have been in compliance with what we have asked them to do."
   
 Scramble schedule
   
 Besides the opener at Wisconsin, the Illini also have tough home games against Minnesota (Nov. 7) and Ohio State (Nov. 28). Illinois was originally scheduled to open with a nonconference home game against Illinois State on Sept. 4. Then, the Illini were supposed to start with a Thursday night home game against Ohio State on Sept. 3. That changed again when the season was postponed in August.

Mumbai The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) will reopen for morning walkers on Thursday after it was closed since March 18 in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.Morning walkers will be able to visit the park between 5.30am and 7.30am, daily. The park will remain closed on Mondays.SGNP officials have put in place a mechanism wherein morning walkers have been divided into three groups - A, B and C - based on the first letter of their names mentioned on the morning pass. "This means, names starting from A to L will be part of group A and will be allowed to enter the park on Thursday. On Friday, names starting from J to Q under group B will be allowed to walk, and finally, names starting from R to Z under group C will be allowed entry on Saturday. This pattern will be repeated over three days for the first one week," said G Mallikarjuna, director and conservator of forest, SGNP, adding that the schedule for each group would be displayed on the park notice board and SGNP website.Mallikarjuna said there were around 9,000 registered morning walkers across four locations in SGNP - Borivli, Yeoor, Manpada and Mulund (Tara Singh Park). At Borivli, there are two main walking paths. The first is from the main gate to Trimurti Road Tumnipada gate and back, covering 5km. The second is from the main gate to the police chowki, forest division office, rest house 3, to the animal hospital, then the boating ticket counter, next to the path along Dahisar river (over the bridge), and finally exiting from the main gate (covering 4km)."We will be monitoring the number of people entering the park across all these areas, with dedicated staff at all four locations. We will be using the alphabetical technique at Borivli to experiment with its efficiency and then replicate it at other sites. However, if it is becoming too crowded, we will take the necessary steps within a week," said Mallikarjuna.Meanwhile, among other 17 listed guidelines, entry to pregnant women, children below 10 years of age and senior citizens over 65 have been prohibited from entering the park. Walkers have to bring their face masks and sanitisers. Social distancing needs to be maintained. Spitting is prohibited. Gathering of groups for yoga, laughing exercise, meditation etc, is prohibited, the guidelines said."Those without masks will not be allowed to enter. Any person having symptoms associated with Covid-19 is requested to avoid entering the park and if they do, their details will be shared with the nearest Covid-19 centre," said Mallikarjuna, adding, "At the end of the day, it is up to citizens to take care of their health. We are only facilitating a safe environment during this pandemic." Those with old walkers' passes will be allowed till November 15 but would need to renew their passes.A newly- developed parking area (with free parking at the moment) will house visitor's vehicles. "We aim to see how feasible this plan is. If it is positive, we will steadily open the park for tourists but at the same time, stop the entry of any private vehicles within SGNP when the final decision is taken," said Mallikarjuna.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Wednesday told a special court in Kochi that some of the accused have links with the gang of Dawood Ibrahim and they visited Tanzania several times where the underworld don has an extensive network. The accused had challenged the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in the smuggling case, arguing that smuggling comes under economic offence and no terror angle was involved in the case. Countering that, the NIA said some of the accused in the case have links with anti-national forces. Elaborating its point, the NIA said accused No 5 in the case KT Ramees and accused No 13 M Sharafuddin had visited Tanzania a number of times and met Dawood's contact Feroze 'Oasis' and discussed ways to smuggle firearms into the country. Earlier, Ramees was caught with smuggled revolvers at the Kozhikode airport. But later he got away, saying he was a member of the shooting association and remitted fine. It also said one of the arrested Muhamad Ali was an accused in chopping off the palm of a college teacher who prepared a controversial question paper but was later acquitted by a court in 2015. The NIA said he had close links with some of the fundamentalist outfits conspiring against the country. The court is expected to deliver its verdict on Friday. This is the first time that the anti-terror law was invoked in a smuggling case. Meanwhile, senior Indian Administrative Service officer M Sivasankar, who was Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's secretary, on Wednesday moved the high court for anticipatory bail after the Enforcement Directorate summoned him again in connection with the case. He was suspended in July after his alleged liaison with Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the case, came to light. In his bail plea he contended that he was questioned for more than 90 hours by different central agencies and they failed to detect any anomalies. He said he was fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation. To satisfy some vested interests, now agencies are under pressure to arrest him, he said in the plea which will be taken up on Thursday. There are reports the ED may file a case against him for money laundering. During investigation, it found that he had made several foreign trips and in some of them official permission was not sought. He was also aware of the questionable integrity of Swapna Suresh and he went out of way to help her, the ED said. The sensational smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized from a consignment in the UAE consulate. P Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate who came to receive it, was arrested by the customs and two other suspects, Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Sivasankar was suspended shortly after that. Now a multi-agency team is probing the case and 30 people have been arrested. Besides the NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax are also part of the investigation. The ED had questioned Kerala Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel in connection with alleged import of holy books and dry dates.

Jayson Molumby started again and there was a senior debut from the off for West Brom's Dara O'Shea who became Shane Duffy's fourth partner over the course of the game here and the previous two against Wales and Slovakia.
 O'Shea performed well, showing a composure that belied his years.
 Daryl Horgan and Sean Maguire, both of them used off the bench against the Welsh on Sunday, were handed starts while Aaron Connolly finally got to line out for a fixture in this international period after his own Covid-related dramas of recent days.
 Adam Idah got some minutes at the end, too.
 Finland made three changes to the team that saw off Bulgaria 2-0 in this competition at the weekend. Just as notable was the sight and sound of the 7,000 spectators allowed inside the Olympic Stadium for this one.
 The first-half told an all-too familiar story. The visitors worked some decent passing moves and a handful of half-chances but the finishing touch was again absent as players fluffed their lines in that crucial final third.
 Jeff Hendrick had a shot blocked by a defender after a pull back by Daryl Horgan, Connolly had a few efforts from distance, Matt Doherty let a pass behind the defence through his feet and Sean Maguire's poor first touch cost him an excellent chance in the area.
 Finland looked dangerous on the break and created the more clearcut chances with Teemu Pukki sending two shots spilling past Darren Randolph's right-hand post towards the end of a first-half which they finished strongly.
 The second period started slowly but Finland began to turn the screw through Pukki who twice almost engineered the opening goal. His time was about to come but not before Enda Stevens clipped the top of the bar with an intsinctive swing of the boot.
 These are the tight margins that just aren't falling in Ireland's favour.
 Doherty drove one wide on the overlap shortly after and then Pukki finally had his reward 66 minutes in, the Norwich City striker pilfering a poor Randolph kick-out and squaring for Fredrik Jensen to do as he did in Dublin last month and open the scoring.
 Ireland's attempts at an answer were all founded on superb crosses by Robbie Brady but three headers came to nothing. Duffy's flew over the bar, Doherty's was tipped over it and goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky somehow got down low enough to deny Ronan Curtis' superb effort in injury-time.
 It may well go down as save of the season. Typical.

“I’m feeling relieved that I don’t have to worry about what’ll happen tomorrow,” Lau-Mui said.
 She had other concerns that influenced her to opt out of the hybrid program, including that her children might have multiple teachers for the same subject, which made her worry that their instruction would be confusing or inconsistent.
 But she also has questions about the quality of remote instruction and wonders whether her children are being adequately prepared for state exams. Lau-Mui said some of her oldest daughter’s class times have been cut by half so that the teachers can divide their time between teaching all-remote and hybrid students.
 “Remote learning is working to keep the kids busy,” she said. “I don’t know if they’re getting the rigor.”
 Other parents said that hybrid instruction does not allow working parents to fully return to their jobs because students will be in classes just one to three days a week. And they questioned the educational payback from such limited in-person instruction.
 Cathy Grodsky of Bayside had planned to enroll her four children, ages 11, 12, 15 and 17, in blended instruction. But as the weeks went by, she lost confidence that her three youngest children would receive much actual in- person teaching under the hybrid plan.
 “Remote learning exceeded my expectations,” she said. “It’s exponentially better than it was in the spring.”
 The president of the district’s elected parent council, Grodsky also began to question whether the city’s virus testing plan would be adequate to keep the disease out of her home, since her 94-year-old father lives with them. Some experts say that the city’s plan, which calls for testing 10% to 20% of each school every month, will not be sufficient to identify outbreaks quickly.
 “At the end of the day, I wasn’t willing to risk my dad’s health for an inadequate plan for my kids,” she said.
 Parents across the city who chose hybrid learning said they felt reassured knowing they could eventually switch to all-remote, something the city allows them to do at any time.

When Haley Neidich's water broke the day before her maternity leave was set to begin, the psychotherapist who served as clinical director for a telehealth company at the time calmly kept working for about two hours to wrap up loose ends.
 "I was experiencing intense fear about labor and birth, and my brain needed some time to come to terms with reality that it was my birthing day," Neidich said, calling her reaction to work a denial coping mechanism.
 After those few hours, though, "I allowed myself to be supported and feel my fear."
 "In hindsight, I think it is a fun part of our birth story and it felt like it was exactly what I needed to go through at the time," she said. "I _chose_ to work during labor, but I was not expected to and I knew I could stop at any time."
 Neidich, who specializes in maternal mental health, knows not all American moms have that autonomy over their work during and after labor.
 "We live in a culture with no paid leave for birthing people and a real lack of understanding of how we can support women who are preparing for their birthing day and postpartum," she said. "My hope would be that women can feel empowered to focus only on their needs and the needs of their baby during labor, birth, and postpartum."

Besides the NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax are also part of the investigation. The ED had questioned Kerala Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel in connection with alleged import of holy books and dry dates.

As a statement from one team, Corinthian Casuals, made clear, the regulations give the impression that “the coronavirus is clever enough to distinguish” between fans of different sides.
 The primary problem with the web of rules and diktats, though, is all the holes in it. Jeff Hutton, the general manager of Bromley — condemned to play without fans — said his club was focusing on how to stanch the financial damage from playing in an empty stadium. “It costs us to get the game on, to manage a livestream, as well as to pay the players,” he said. The British government has promised grants to help clubs like Bromley survive — several Premier League powerhouses recently floated a plan of their own — but the money has yet to appear.
 At the same time and in the same place, Cray is having a sudden attendance boom. “We’re the highest level you can watch at the moment,” Wright said. "On a day like Sunday, when there is no Premier League on television, we’re hoping we can be quite a big draw.
 “It seems strange to say it, given the situation, but it is helpful for us as a club.”

Martin Davis, father of U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville, has had a home on Springfield's west side since 1994, voted from there for decades and takes a homestead exemption on the property.
   
 But that home is in the 18th Congressional District -- not his son's 13th Congressional District.
   
 Well, Illinois law is not super-strict concerning what you call your voting residence, and since the 2016 primary, Martin Davis has been voting in the 13th. And in this year's primary, he was elected a 13th district delegate to the Republican National Convention, pledged to President Donald Trump. Rep. Davis is an honorary co-chair of the Trump campaign in Illinois.
   
 The address the elder Davis uses as a base for his votes and candidacy is a modest one-story home in Taylorville, between a Walgreens and an auto repair shop, with its back yard near one of his McDonald's restaurants. He purchased the home in 2013 -- after his son won his first election to Congress, in 2012.
   
 It's not clear how often the elder Davis stays at the Taylorville home. He didn't return messages.
   
 There are clear indications that Martin Davis considers his Springfield home his primary residence given that he takes an owner-occupied tax break on it and used it as his address in a corporate filing with the secretary of state in December.
   
 But the state GOP's top lawyer says the Taylorville home is fine as a voting base and running for election. Rep. Davis says he doesn't keep tabs on where his father sleeps but likens his being registered to vote in Taylorville to a college student being away from one home and registering and voting from campus.
   
 Burt Odelson, a Chicago election lawyer knowledgeable about residency questions, said Illinois law got more flexible about residency a few years ago. Odelson tried to block Rahm Emanuel from running for mayor of Chicago in 2011 after Emanuel rented out his Chicago home when he was chief of staff to President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C.
   
 "The appellate court ruled for me that he needs to have a physical presence there," Odelson said, saying that is "what law used to be. Then, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the appellate court and put him back on the ballot as long as he has some presence and has an intent to remain in the house.
   
 "I would tell you as an election lawyer, you can only register to vote from your primary residence that you call home," Odelson added. "But where you call home has now been redefined after the Emanuel case."
   
 Emanuel went on to become Chicago mayor from 2011 to 2019.
   
 As for Martin Davis, "when you fill out your application to vote, you swear that this is your residence address," Odelson said. "I think he's OK there. ...The problem I see is the homestead exemption, because the homestead exemption is where you call home."
   
 John Fogarty Jr., general counsel to the Republican Party of Illinois, said under national GOP rules set for the convention, a delegate elected from a congressional district needed to be a resident and voter in that district.
   
 "I can assure you that Mr. Davis spends a not insignificant amount of time at the Taylorville residence," Fogarty said. "He does have a residence in Springfield as well. But … he travels a lot. He might be outside of Illinois more than he's inside of it."
   
 Fogarty said he doesn't have Davis's full schedule. "He stays in Taylorville, he stays in Springfield. That's the extent of what I know, and there is absolutely nothing that's a problem with that." He also noted that the Taylorville property is "not an insignificant drive" from the Springfield home. They are more than 30 miles apart.
   
 Matt Dietrich, spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said the authority to challenge a voter registration rests with county clerks, and Davis' registration "appears to have not been challenged" in Christian County.
   
 Rep. Davis, following a Springfield event last week, pointed out that his father is not taking a tax break on more than one house, and "a lot of folks own multiple houses."
   
 "You're going to have to talk to him about how many nights he can stay in certain places," said Davis, who is seeking his fifth two-year term in the Nov. 3 election against Democrat Betsy Londrigan of Springfield. "He goes to Iowa on a regular basis. So, those are the types of issues that I obviously don't keep tabs on with my dad."
   
 Rep. Davis also mentioned how college students, including his children, can register and vote where they attend school.
   
 Sangamon County records show that the 2019 fair market value of his two-story Lincolnshire home was $225,396. The assessed value is a third of market value. After that value is subject to township and county multipliers, the homestead exemption reduces the equalized assessed value $6,000. Martin Davis' 2019 property-tax bill on the Springfield home was $5,351, and without the exemption, it would have been $464 higher.
   
 That one-story Taylorville home at 411 N. Webster St., had a minivan with a broken tail-light in the driveway one day last week. There was a Davis campaign sticker on the van's back window, and there were Davis yard signs in front of the house. The steps up to the front door were covered with green synthetic turf, torn in places. There was jagged hole in the wood above the doorway, near the gutters, and there was a "no trespassing" sign visible through a window by the door.
   
 The two-story home in Lincolnshire had well-manicured landscaping and did not show any signs of disrepair. No political signs were in the front yard that day.
   
 In the case concerning Emanuel, Maksym vs. the Chicago elections board, justices noted that establishing residency requires a physical presence, and an intent to remain in that place as a permanent home.
   
 "Once residency is established, the test is no longer physical presence but rather abandonment," the justices wrote, meaning it has to be proven the person doesn't intend to return to the home considered the residence. Emanuel had left some furniture and belongings in the Chicago home, always talked of his work in Washington for Obama being temporary, paid taxes on the Chicago home and kept his Illinois driver's license with that address.
   
 The appellate court had used an argument that Emanuel needed to actually live in the home for a year before the election, but the high court said precedent showed otherwise.
   
 The opinion was written by now-retired Justice Robert Thomas, who had been elected as a Republican. Two justices - now-Chief Justice Anne Burke and late Justice Charles Freeman - who had been elected as Democrats, concurred with the opinion, but noted in their concurrence how the law has taken some twists and turns.
   
 The Illinois Supreme Court, Burke and Freeman wrote, "has not always spoken clearly on what is meant by residency. … That is why both sides in this dispute can contend that their respective positions are supported by decades of precedent. … (T)he only thing that is well established in this case is the confusion that has existed on this subject."
   
 As to if the voting home must be the primary residence, Odelson said, "It has to be a residence where he intends to come back to if he's out of town, or if he's renting somewhere else."
   
 Rodebrad Management is a company headed by Martin Davis. In its annual report with the Illinois secretary of state on Dec. 30 -- less than a year ago -- Davis listed the company's address as the same as his Springfield home in the Lincolnshire subdivision.
   
 I've run into the elder Davis in Springfield more than once. I wondered how often he made that drive in from Taylorville. Now, I have a better understanding.

When Brianna Hill's water broke while taking the bar exam, the recent law school graduate in Chicago soldiered on, finishing the section in accordance with the test's remote rules, which say lawyers must remain seated to ensure they aren't cheating.
 After cleaning up and checking with her family and midwife, she finished the second portion too. Only after that did she and her husband head to the hospital, where their son was born less than five hours later.
 The next day, Hill completed the rest of the exam -- four 90-minute segments in total -- from a private hospital room, breastfeeding her newborn during breaks.
 "The whole time [during labor] my husband and I were talking about how I wanted to finish the test and my midwife and nurses were on board," Hill said, according to Above the Law. "There just wasn't another option in my mind."
