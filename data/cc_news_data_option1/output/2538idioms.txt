In Latin America, Brazil has a confirmed caseload and death count second only to the United States, and its leader is unwilling to take steps to stem the spread of the virus. Alarming escalations are unfolding in Peru, Chile, Ecuador and Panama, even after they imposed early lockdowns.
 The first reports of disarray are also emerging from hospitals in South Africa, which has its continent’s most developed economy. Sick patients are lying on beds in corridors as one hospital runs out of space. At another, an emergency morgue was needed to hold more than 700 bodies.
 “We are reaping the whirlwind now,” said Francois Venter, a South African health expert at the University of Witswatersrand in Johannesburg.
 Worldwide, there are 10.1 million confirmed cases and over 502,000 reported deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say both those numbers undercount the true toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing and missed mild cases.
 South Africa has more than a third of Africa’s confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 138,000. It’s ahead of other African countries in the pandemic timeline and approaching its peak. So far its facilities have managed to cope, but if they become overwhelmed, it will be a grim forewarning because South Africa’s health system is reputed to be the continent’s best.
 Most poor countries took action early on. Some, like Uganda, which already had a sophisticated detection system built up during its yearslong battle with viral hemorrhagic fever, have thus far been arguably more successful than the U.S. and other wealthy countries in battling coronavirus.
 But since the beginning of the pandemic, poor and conflict-ravaged countries have been at a major disadvantage. The global scramble for protective equipment sent prices soaring. Testing kits have also been hard to come by. Tracking and quarantining patients requires large numbers of health workers.
 “It’s all a domino effect,” said Kate White, head of emergencies for Doctors Without Borders. “Whenever you have countries that are economically not as well off as others, then they will be adversely affected.”
 Global health experts say testing is key, but months into the pandemic, few developing countries can keep carrying out the tens of thousands of tests every week needed to detect and contain outbreaks.
 “The majority of the places that we work in are not able to have that level of testing capacity, and that’s the level that you need to be able to get things really under control,” White said.
 South Africa leads Africa in testing, but an initially promising program has now been overrun in Cape Town, which alone has more reported cases than any other African country except Egypt. Critical shortages of kits have forced city officials to abandon testing for anyone under 55 unless they have a serious health condition or are in a hospital.
 Venter said Cape Town’s hospitals are managing to cope “by the skin of their teeth” and now Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city, is experiencing a surge of infections. He said South Africa’s rising cases could easily play out next in “the big cities of Nigeria, Congo, Kenya,” and they “do not have the health resources that we do.”

 ## Seeking positive change
 "We do need good officers," said recruit Tessa Vanderpool, a 24-year-old Amboy, Clark County, native and Arizona State University graduate recently hired as an officer in Camas, just 35 miles south of where she grew up.
 Vanderpool entered the state's Basic Law Enforcement Academy (BLEA) with a class in January, but says she realized even before her decision to go into law enforcement that the profession is flawed and that racism and brutality pervade its ranks.
 "I thought I could make a positive impact," she said. "There are people who recognize the issue and want to be better."
 The Floyd killing in Minneapolis on May 25 and the shooting of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta on June 12 "are topics" among the recruits, she said. "Everybody has their own opinion," she said. "But everyone is talking about how we can make a change and be better."
 That is the stated goal of the BLEA trainers overseeing Vanderpool's class of recruits. But they know the system — they came up in it — and they know the pressures, and they know that even the best-intended recruit can wind up the focus of the next outrageous police-abuse video down the road.

LONDON (AP) — Residents of the central English city of Leicester waited Monday to hear whether lockdown restrictions will persist for their area for two weeks longer following a spike in coronavirus infections.
 Leicester has recorded 866 new coronavirus cases in the two weeks up to June 23, or nearly a third of its total through the pandemic. That prompted Home Secretary Priti Patel to indicate over the weekend that the city would face a local lockdown in a bid to get the outbreak under control. It would be the first time a U.K. city faced a local lockdown.
 At the very least, there are indications that the government wants the current restrictions to remain in place for Leicester for two weeks beyond Saturday, when pubs and restaurants, among others, will be allowed to reopen in England for the first time in more than three months.
 “We are concerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday while on a visit to a construction site in London. "I want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet.”
 The U.K. has recorded more than 43,600 deaths, the highest by far in Europe. The government, which sets the coronavirus response for England, has said it won't hesitate to reimpose lockdown restrictions on a specific region in the event of a local outbreak.
 Leicester's mayor, Peter Soulsby, said a document sent to him by the British government early Monday indicated the city of 330,000 will continue with "the present level of restriction for a further two weeks beyond July 4.”

 "In our game, there's nothing more honorable than tipping your cap," Kendrick said. "And once I realized that national day of recognition was going to fall by the wayside, I thought, 'OK, maybe we can do it next year.' But that didn't really do it.
 "So then I thought, 'How about a virtual tip of the cap?''' Kendrick paused, then chuckled. "And let me say here and now, there is no way I could have done this myself. I could not be more proud of the response."

The danger of Trump lies in his remarkable capacity to mainstream views that previously had been beyond the pale (at least in official Washington). A significant number of Americans feel liberated, thanks to his imprimatur, to give voice to the worst angels of their nature. Transforming such deep-seated belief systems represents quite a different challenge than changing the guard in the Oval Office and beyond. After all, democratic societies don't send people off to reeducation camps. Certain communities, like universities, can legislate against hate speech, but it's people's hearts and minds, not just their tongues, that must be reached.
 To do so, it's imperative to separate the legitimate grievances of Trump supporters from the illegitimate ones. Yes, "bad hombres" are attracted to Trump's racism, misogyny, and xenophobia, but many of the disenfranchised who voted for him were motivated by a disgust at political elites and the raging economic inequality they produced in this land. After the triple whammy of the coronavirus pandemic (and its disproportionate impact on the working poor), the economic semi-collapse that followed its spread (and the disproportionate benefits Amazon's Jeff Bezos and other billionaires drew from it), and an epidemic of police violence (visited on people of color), more and more Americans are coming to feel that the status quo is simply unacceptable. They're disgusted by Republican duplicity but also by the Democrats' version of business as usual.

LONDON — Plenty of food debates were going on in our house during the recent lockdown. Unlike in normal times, when the kids were presented with their dinner, no questions asked, we found time to play restaurant (while badly missing the real thing) and discuss the next day’s menu in detail.
 Like many boys his age, our youngest son, Flynn, who is 4, would present a wish list of items that were exclusively carby and wholly white. Doughboy, as we like to call him, would ask for naked bread to start, followed by “pasta with nothing,” then plain potatoes and, to finish, a slice of cake, ideally served with leftover pancakes from breakfast.
 Particular as all this may sound, I am not entirely sure that this starchy obsession is necessarily a Flynn thing, or even a 4-year-old thing. As I was cooking one of his bread-centered meals, I was giggling to myself, thinking of some classic carb-on-carb extremes, such as the chip butty, a British phenomenon I have managed to successfully dodge in my two decades in England. It’s, essentially, two slices of buttered white bread with a mountain of fries in between them. Or, I suppose equally bizarre to an outsider, the pitas I had growing up in Israel, stuffed with shawarma and salad, and then topped with lots of potato chips and an optional spoonful of fried pita croutons for crunch.
 I would not consider either version of potato-meets-bread the high point of local cuisine, but the combination is undeniably satisfying. Perhaps more sophisticated, if I am allowed a little more judgment, are Italian flatbreads — focaccia or schiacciata — topped with rosemary, coarse salt and thin potato slices, evenly spread over olive oil-scented bread, locking in moisture and adding texture and their own subtle flavor.
 Another example that I love is Tunisian fricassee, a sandwich made with bread rolls cooked in oil, just like doughnuts, and stuffed with tuna, cooked potato, black olives, boiled egg and a spoonful of spicy harissa. It isn’t very difficult to imagine how delicious these are.
 Satisfying Flynn’s starchy needs also made me think of maaqouda, another North African staple. These are little fried mashed potato cakes or fritters, often sold on the street, either on their own or stuffed into bread with harissa or tomato sauce. I had the sandwich version a few times in Tunisia and Morocco and never felt a carb overload. Just like a good potato focaccia or a fricassee, the secret lies in a fine balance of textures — a little doughy, not at all dry, with a tiny bit of crunch — and a clear underlying flavor that holds everything together, from the rosemary or the harissa.

Training and equipment
 Haberfeld, a former Israeli police lieutenant and an expert on police practices and training, said recruiting the right people and training them — not for a few weeks, but for a few years — is likely the only long-term solution to the endemic racism and use-of-force issues that have sullied the profession.
 She believes the U.S. should look at training protocols in counties such as Norway and Finland, where police recruits go through as many as three years of school and training, along with an entire year as an observer, before they're allowed on the streets.
 In the U.S., the longest police academy lasts 32 weeks, Haberfeld said. The average amount of training a cadet receives is about 17 weeks.
 In Washington, the Basic Law Enforcement Academy is 18 weeks, although some departments like Seattle build on that with several weeks of their own training before a rookie is assigned to a training officer and put on the streets.
 By comparison, a cosmetologist in Washington must undergo 1,600 hours (400 weeks) of schooling and training for a license. A barber must have 1,000 hours (250 weeks), according to the state Department of Licensing website.
 Who police departments recruit is also crucial, Haberfeld said, and American departments mostly do it wrong. A primary source for law enforcement recruiting in the U.S. is the military. Haberfeld thinks recruiting military veterans is a "horrible idea."

Tara Davis of Elk Plain, Pierce County, wants her participation in the new CBS reality competition “Tough as Nails” (premiering at 8 p.m. Wednesday, July 8) to draw attention to women iron workers and to show that a person’s family history does not define his or her future.
 “Tough as Nails,” created and hosted by “Amazing Race” star Phil Keoghan, takes 12 Americans "who don't think twice … about getting their hands dirty, in order to keep their country running" — welder, farmer, roofer, firefighter, etc. — and tasks them with real-world, on-the-job challenges, from working on a railroad or at a sand factory to assembling irrigation equipment. In the premiere episode, Spokane native Danny Moody, a drywaller, excels at moving bags of Spec Mix. At the end of the season, one competitor will be named “Tough as Nails” champion, winning $200,000 and a pickup truck.
 Davis, 31, became an iron worker in 2018 after 10 years as an orthodontic technician. She’s a member of Seattle’s Iron Workers Union Local 86 and says she’s one of two women iron workers at the company she works for, Rebar International in Edgewood. Her current work assignment is the Bellevue Tunnel, part of the Sound Transit East Link extension.
 “I’m the only female iron worker at my job site,” she says. “As a female, it’s not written and no one’s ever said it, but we give 120% to 150% because we want to prove we’re here, we can do it just as much as you can.

"I worked in the Black and brown community," he said. "I thought I was protecting my community, my people. I said, 'I'm going to do good, and to do that, I have to take the bad guy to jail.'"
 He said that made him the kind of cop who would arrest someone and impound their car for driving on a suspended license, not ever considering that person might need that car to work to make money to pay the fine to restore that license; or that the driver might be the sole provider of a family somewhere. Many of those people were poor and of color — often the reason they'd been targeted in the first place.
 "Today I know that all of that is part of the weaponization of law enforcement against these communities," he said. "I thought I was doing good police work, and I was not. I feel sick about it."
 Hendrickson, the de-escalation expert, said he doesn't believe policing will change significantly until "someone comes up with a better metric to determine what makes a good cop." Because as it stands, he said, most departments continue to look at the numbers of arrests, and that drives the institutional racism.
 Once it is decided what police should do and how, then Hendrickson said he and other trainers at the academy can design a curriculum to achieve it. While it might not seem it, police best practices have moved away from the "ask, tell, make" interactions to the sort of take-it-slow de-escalation model taught today.
 Hendrickson said he was brought up in a department that believed overwhelming force resolved all problems.
