Need we be reminded that, even those in the so-called ‘developed’ and ‘democratic’ world, did not get these rights on a silver platter – but, unflinchingly and gallantly ‘fought’ for them at the dawn of their republics, having suffered untold brutality, corruption, and injustices at the hands of their tyrannical leaders, usually monarchies…and, are still struggling for a better life, as witnessed by the likes of the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States of America, in the face of police brutality.

To add insult to injury, these same nurses had, in last month’s (November) high court ruling, effectively won their case challenging the health minister’s unilateral cancellation of the flexible working hours arrangement between the nurses and government – yet, in what can only be described as twisted, perplexing, and inexplicable, they turn around, apologize for winning their case, and promise to comply with the illegal move by their employer.

And today, Dundumwezi UPND member of parliament Edgar Sing’ombe is questioning the Commission’s readiness to conduct next year’s elections. Sing’ombe says, “Here in Nkandazovu, about 400 potential voters have not been captured. In Naluja 200 plus people have not been captured, in Kasukwe the system is on and off. ECZ are not ready for the elections. If they are then they are deliberately disenfranchising the people of Dundumwezi and Southern Province at large."

Honestly, why – after going through that commendable, self-respecting, and, most times, perilous successful journey of industrial action, and litigation against their employer – wake up one morning and decide that they were no longer interested in a better livelihood – yet, in the same breath, declaring their preparedness in pursuing an “amicable resolution to problems”?

Emilio Vitolo and Katie Holmes have been together, by my records, for about three months. We first saw them out and about together in early September, but I feel pretty comfortable saying that this relationship started in mid to late August, at the very latest. That was when Emilio dumped his live-in fiancee via text, and since then, Emilio has been attached to Katie’s hip. She loves every minute of it, and they’ve done tons of pap strolls all over New York. I think they color-coordinate their outfits too. Which is sure sign of steadiness and true love, yes? So obviously, Katie reportedly thinks that they could “go all the way.”
