PARISH – On Sept. 17 the Parish town board voted to replace the town bookkeeper/payroll clerk with a town comptroller.
 Supervisor Mary Ann Phillips asked the board to delay its vote until more information could be gathered. The board denied that request and voted. Phillips said that vote on a resolution not on the agenda was planned outside a public meeting and is in violation of the state’s public meetings law. Bookkeeper Samantha Spataro interpreted it as a vote of no confidence and virtually a termination of her position and has not returned.
 Meanwhile, state law prohibits towns as small as Parish from simply hiring comptrollers. Those, according to the law, are reserved for towns with populations of at least 40,000 people. Parish has 3,000 people. Only if the people of Parish vote to hire a comptroller will the state make an exception. It is unknown when such a referendum will take place. It could be assumed that, at the latest, such a vote would take place a year from now in November 2021.
 Until then, the town may find itself in a somewhat precarious financial predicament. Parish is just emerging from a years-long financial disaster. In 2017, the State Comptroller’s Office designated Parish a town in “significant fiscal stress,” assigning it a fiscal stress score of 70. Zero is the best possible score. In 2018, Phillips’ first year in office, that score improved slightly to 66.7. Then Phillips hired Spataro as bookkeeper/payroll clerk, and by 2019 that score had vastly improved to 13.3, at which point the town was no longer considered under fiscal stress by the state.
 Phillips vehemently objected to the board’s decision to eliminate Spataro’s $16,000 a year part-time position.
 “She did a whole lot for this town,” Phillips said. “I mean, for her to have done what she did with the Office of State Comptrollers to bring us down to a 13.3 from a 66.7, she must be doing something right. There’s no reason for what they (the board) did. It’s just mean and vindictive, and they really hurt her big-time.”
 The board has questioned Spataro’s numbers, according to Phillips and Spataro. Phillips attributes the board’s lack of understanding to ignorance.
 “They don’t believe her numbers or understand them, because none of them have gone to town councilor board member training,” Phillips said. “It’s two-and-a- half days. The Association of Towns does it, the Office of State Comptrollers does it. These are people who know what’s supposed to be done and how it’s supposed to be done, and they’re there to help you learn that. And not one of the other councilors has been to it. I went to it when I was a councilor, and then I went to the one in January 2018 when I was supervisor for the supervisor’s training. I believe they have it for every elected position that there is. Because the board has not been there, they don’t know how to read my monthly reports. Every question that they could have about finances, whether its revenue or expenditure is in those monthly reports. Every question would be answered if they knew how to read it. So, they don’t know how to get whatever question they have answered, because they don’t know how to understand the reports.”
 Phillips has warned the board they don’t know what they’re getting into. She said the board believes it will just be able to tack Spataro’s bookkeeping and payroll duties onto the comptroller’s duties at a price only slightly higher than what the town was paying Spataro. Both Phillips and Spataro say that is a pipe dream, especially in light of the board’s insistence that the comptroller be a CPA (certified public accountant).
 Phillips estimates the cost of a comptroller will be in the range of $20,000 to $30,000, not including bookkeeping or payroll. That will cost at least another $16,000 and probably more. Phillips says she has told the board this, “But they don’t believe me,” she said.
 “I don’t think that they understand that they are not going to find someone that has more experience than I do that’s willing to do that job for that salary,” Spataro said. “They’re just not. They are not going to find a CPA that is willing to come in and take over a bookkeeping and payroll clerk’s job for that kind of money. CPAs are expensive. CPAs are the ones you hire to do your audit. They’re not going to do the bookkeeping and the payroll as well. I just don’t think the board quite understands all the aspects involved.”
 And she doesn’t understand why the board voted to eliminate her job.
 “In my opinion, I was an asset to the town,” Spataro said, “and I was willing to help them out. When I was hired in April of 2019, I inherited a mess, an absolute bookkeeping disaster.”
 She brought payroll in-house. It had been outsourced to an outside firm.
 “I know how to do it,” she said. “I can do it. It’s no problem. It’s much less expensive for the town. It makes more sense to do that sort of thing in-house. So, I did that.”
 Municipal accounting is a specialty. It differs from traditional accounting in many ways. Spataro said she has the experience the job requires and said she was willing to answer any questions the board had.
 “I’ve worked for a town before (Minetto),” she said. “I’ve worked in an accounting firm. I’ve started a company from the ground up. This job is easy. I don’t have a problem doing this job, and I don’t have a problem answering any of your questions. I’ll go through all the books with you. I’ll explain it all to you anytime. I thought they were fine with me. Nobody ever asked me any questions. Nobody ever came to me and said, ‘Can you show me this, can you explain this to me?’
 “Nobody told me they were having a problem with my position,” she continued. “Nobody asked me anything. Nobody said that we’re thinking of replacing the bookkeeper job with a comptroller job. Nothing until they had that meeting and decided that they were going to replace the bookkeeper and the payroll clerk with a comptroller, and they were going to start looking for somebody. So, that was it. The town voted to no longer have my position. So, I cleaned out my desk, and I left.
 “They didn’t want me to be there anymore. I don’t believe that it’s anything personal. But, why would I stick around and continue to help them when they have clearly said they don’t want me in the position anymore, that they’re finding someone to replace me? I’m not going to sit around and wait until they say, ‘OK, we no longer need you.’ That’s just insane. I have worked very hard to get the town into a better position. I talked long hours with the (state) Comptroller’s office to better the town’s books.
 “The town started to come out of that negative fiscal stress score in 2019, and I guarantee they will for 2020, and it’s getting better and better. And I know, in large part, it’s because of some of the things that I did.”
 Furthermore, she said, had she been asked to work for them as a comptroller, she would have agreed.
 Town board member Gary Wood did not return calls asking for his opinion on this situation.
 Town board member Douglas Jordan could not be reached for comment.

Dear Abby,
 I retired a year ago from a stressful job because I couldn’t take what it was doing to my health. Despite a divorce after a 35-year marriage 10 years ago, I had recovered financially. I was lucky to have landed a job in my early 30s that had an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, and I contributed to it for 34 years, putting in as much as I could. I am able to collect enough Social Security and withdraw a small amount from the 401(k) to live as I did when I worked.
 I always had hobbies, interests and things I wanted to do but never had time for. I have been very happy and busy ever since. During the quarantine, getting groceries was a bit of a challenge, but I live simply and had no problems.
 I am shocked at all the furloughed people who are having fits and complaining that they are bored out of their minds. This should be a wake-up call that they need to get a life. For these people, retirement is going to be really hard. Also, they need to plan for the future and have a six- to 12-month emergency fund.
 I have put old home movies on DVDs, reorganized photo albums, cleared out a lot of stuff to simplify my life, put in a vegetable garden, made a quilt. COVID or not, I am a busy woman. Can you encourage all those bored people to learn a new craft, try a new recipe, make a birdhouse, SOMETHING other than call this busy woman and distract me from my projects?
 Living It Up In New Hampshire
 No, but YOU should certainly consider doing it. You can also make yourself less available to the complainers by putting your phone on mute during the hours you prefer not to be disturbed. This is not to say your suggestions aren’t good ones, just that I have urged readers for years to prepare well in advance for retirement and discuss with their spouse (if they have one) how the realities of daily living will change when it comes to chores and conserving personal space.
 Dear Abby,
 A man has been reaching out to me on social media for three years. He claims to be in love with me (after having met me once, briefly), and I think I believe him.
 It’s hard to explain, but I think I may feel the same way toward him. The problem is, I have ignored him for the last three years. I blocked him on all social media, but he keeps finding ways to contact me. He even had flowers delivered to my house. To tell the truth, I ghosted him because I’m terrified of what our “love at first sight” connection could mean. I have been hurt in the past, and I know a relationship of this magnitude could destroy me emotionally.
 I feel terrible for ignoring him, but my friends and family insist that he is a stalker, and they would never understand if I decided to pursue a relationship with him. I feel paralyzed. What should I do?
 Confused Out East
 If a relationship of this magnitude could destroy you emotionally, then I do not recommend pursuing it. Sane individuals who have been ignored for three years usually take the hint and walk away. Listen to your family. What this man has been doing is, to say the least, unusual and could, indeed, be considered stalking.

A week of rain spoiled crops, washed away bridges and flooded homes across Central America. Hurricane Eta’s arrival Tuesday afternoon in northeast Nicaragua followed days of drenching rain as it crawled toward shore. Its slow, meandering path north through Honduras pushed rivers over their banks and pouring into neighborhoods where families were forced onto rooftops to wait for rescue.
 Marta Julia Portillo, 62, fled her San Pedro Sula neighborhood before dawn Thursday with relatives. They paused at a gas station on dry ground until they were told to move on.
 “We don’t know where to go because we don’t have any place to shelter,” she said. Her son, who stayed behind at the family home, told her water was up to the third floor.
 “I would say the national capacity has been overwhelmed by the size of the impact we are seeing,” said Maite Matheu, Honduras director for the international humanitarian organization CARE. The group was using its network of contacts in Honduras to identify the hardest-hit areas and catalogue their most-pressing needs.
 Honduras Foreign Affairs minister Lisandro Rosales said via Twitter that “the destruction that Eta leaves us is enormous and public finances are at a critical moment because of COVID-19, we make a call to the international community to accelerate the process of recovery and reconstruction.”
 Observers are already anticipating that the havoc wrought by Eta will pressure more people to migrate from countries that are already some of the primary senders of migrants to the United States border in recent years.
 “Now with this situation, this is going to be an exodus, a massive exodus of migrants toward the north,” said Matheu.
 Late Thursday, Tropical Depression Eta had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving north at 8 mph (13 kph). The forecast had it strengthening to a tropical storm before nearing the Cayman Islands Saturday and crossing Cuba Sunday. From there it could reach Florida or at least come close enough to assure heavy rains.
 “Whatever comes out (of Central America) is going to linger awhile,” said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. “I’m not convinced we’re done with Eta.”
 That’s because what’s left of Eta still has spin, which is hard to kill off, and that should help it reform, said NOAA hurricane and climate scientist Jim Kossin.
 Once it reforms and heads toward Cuba, it could meander in the area for awhile.
 “The winds aren’t going to be the problem. The rains are going to be the problem,” Klotzbach said.
 Eta will be so big, wet and messy that it doesn’t have to make landfall in already rain-soaked South Florida to cause a mess, Klotzbach said.
 “Slow-moving sprawling ugly tropical storms can certainly pack a precipitation wallop even if it doesn’t make landfall,” Klotzbach said.
