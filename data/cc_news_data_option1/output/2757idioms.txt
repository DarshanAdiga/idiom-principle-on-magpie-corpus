During 2015’s _Age of Ultron_ , Scarlet Witch distracts the team with these dream sequences early in the movie. One had Cap meeting back up with Peggy Carter for that dance and another is Tony Stark seeing all the Avengers dying around them. (Both of which kind of happen in subsequent _Avengers_ films). For Black Widow, she is taken back to her training in the Red Room where we briefly meet Madame B, played by _Before Sunset_ ’s Julie Delpy. The _Ultron_ scene only teased moments of Black Widow in the Red Room and were curious if _Black Widow_ will be inspired by this _Ultron_ scene to either build upon or reference it.

The protests over the murder of George Floyd have now morphed into a new movement. What began as an outrage about one death has grown into the outrage of many deaths.
 The daily protests are awakening in white America the many problems of what it's like to be black in America. That you can't walk to a store without being killed. You can't jog down the street and not be shot. You can't even sleep in your own damn bed without being slain. This has got to stop!
 You see a white man running down the road and think nothing of it. You see a black man running down the road and you wonder what he's up to. A white man passes you on the street and you ignore him. A black man does the same thing and you watch him carefully. You walk into a store and nothing happens. A black woman walks in the same store and she is kept track of. These are all, whether you know it or not, examples of racism.
