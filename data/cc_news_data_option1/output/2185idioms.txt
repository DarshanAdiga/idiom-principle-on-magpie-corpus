The big question mark here is if Rick Moranis will appear for the reunion. In the original _Ghostbusters_ along with _Ghostbusters II_ , Moranis memorably played the role of Louis Tully. After passing on a cameo in Paul Feig's 2016 reboot, Moranis declined to reprise the role of Louis in _Ghostbusters: Afterlife_. While it seems clear he has no interest in acting in any more _Ghostbusters_ movies, it's not out of the question for Moranis to say hello to his former co-stars for the special reunion on _Reunited Apart_. It would be awesome to see, but I still wouldn't hold my breath on it.

WTI declines from intraday top of $37.66 amid fresh selling. Price positive news concerning OPEC+ and the US-Iran relations fail to overcome Sino-American tension. Market's pre-NFP trading lull adds to the oil traders' worries. US employment data, Baker Hughes Oil Rig Counts will decorate the calendar, news/headlines will be the key. WTI refreshes the intraday low to $37.34 during the initial few minutes of the Tokyo open on Friday. With that, the black gold seems to ignore the upbeat headlines concerning the much-awaited OPEC+ output cut decision and the US-Iran update while taking clues from the tension between the Washington and Beijing. At the start of the Asian session, Bloomberg came out with the news suggesting that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, mostly known as OPEC+, will extend the current production cut output after getting a go from Iraq. The news said, "After almost a week of wrangling, OPEC+ leaders Russia and Saudi Arabia clinched a tentative deal with holdout member Iraq, according to a delegate. The agreement -- though still to be ratified -- means OPEC+ will extend its record production curbs for another month." It should also be noted that Reuters came out with an update indicating the OPEC+ meeting on Saturday. The global oil producers are wrangling over the extension of 9.7 million barrels per day of output cuts as the limit expired on June 01. Also on the positive side was the US President Donald Trump's tweet thanking Iran for the release of another detainee and signaling a possible trade deal with the Gulf nation. On the contrary, the return of the Sino-American tension seems to weigh on the market's risk-tone sentiment as well as on the commodity prices off-late. Be it US President Donald Trump's criticism of Beijing's commitment of Hong Kong or China's performance on a trade deal, not to forget US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's praise to Nasdaq's move on listing rules for Chinese companies, all of them indicate that Washington-based policymakers remain at loggerheads with the Asian major. Even so, the US Trade RepresentativeRobert Lighthizer said that he feels "very good" about phase one trade agreement with China. Amid these catalysts, the US 10-year Treasury yields pause the previous day's rise with a fall of 1.3 basis points (bps) to 0.807% whereas stocks in Japan and the US stock futures also flash mild losses by the press time. Moving on, traders might wait for the monthly US employment data for fresh impulse while taking clues from the output related and the Sino-American headlines in the meantime. Furthermore, the weekly release of the Baker Hughes US Oil Rig Count, prior 222, could also direct immediate price action. Technical analysis Despite staying above 100-day SMA, at $36.00 now, WTI needs to refresh the monthly top beyond $38.30 to regain the bulls' confidence in filling the gap below the early-March low of $41.22.

_WandaVision_ is set in the 1950s and the show looks truly bizarre from the small amount of footage we've been treated to. The series blends the style of classic sitcoms with the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision-two super-powered beings living their ideal suburban lives-begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems. The show is directed by Matt Shakman with Jac Schaeffer on board as head writer. The Tampa Bay Comic Convention Facebook account was the first to reveal that _WandaVision_ was going back for additional photography this summer. You can check out the announcement below.

Some Chatham students will be able to enjoy activities as part of a virtual play day June 19.
 Shane McEvoy, a teacher at Tecumseh Public School, said so far three schools from the Lambton-Kent District School Board have confirmed they will participate.
 He said the schools usually have a "play day" each year just before classes finish up, but it can't happen the regular way this year because students aren't physically attending classes due to COVID-19.
 "We usually do a play day with the kids and they all love it, just fun and games," McEvoy said. "They can't get together to have a little fun with their friends, so we thought we would give this (virtual play day) a try."
 The students will fill out an online form to give their age and school and then pick four or more of the activities they can do from home. After they complete each item, they can post their scores and compare with their friends or students from the other schools, McEvoy said.
 He said these are games they can do at home with items found at home.
 "It's a lot of little throwing activities. They can do laundry basket basketball or keep balloons in the air as long as they can," he said. "Not even a ball is required for most of them."
 McEvoy said he hopes "a couple of hundred or more" of the students will sign up, "but you never know with distance learning."
 He said he will be supplying the sign-up and activity information to a point person from each school, who will then forward it to the teachers. The teachers will then send the information out to the parents.
 "I think it's a nice way for the kids, I hope, to actually get a chance to play with their friends, when they can't really play with their friends, and still have a little fun," McEvoy said.
 As a lead-up to the event, McEvoy said the students have already started working on different challenges related to the activities they'll participate in on the actual day.

Now, there's a certain risk here that people are being dismissive and insensitive to the feelings of Drew Brees and people who think like him. Communication should be a two-way street. It's important for people to understand that for some, any distraction or disruption of the national anthem is deeply hurtful and that this pain has no necessarily malign component. Where Brees failed is his inability to provide this courtesy to the other side.

Also, US stocks are running out of steam ahead of both the weekend and the Nonfarm Payrolls data. We could see some capitulation here of speculative positions which could well be gold's saving grace at this crucial juncture.

Nurses and staff will be able to monitor your loved one around the clock and ensure they do not wander off or harm themselves.
