FILE - In this June 21, 2019 file photo, General Services Administration Administrator Emily Murphy speaks during a ribbon cutting ceremony for the Department of Homeland Security's St. Elizabeths Campus Center Building in Washington. The head of the obscure federal government agency that is holding up Joe Biden's presidential transition knew well before Election Day she might have a messy situation on her hands well. Prior to Nov. 3, GSA administrator Emily Murphy held a Zoom call with Dave Barram, 77, a man who was in her shoes 20 years earlier during the contested 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Barram said he gave her some simple advice, “If you do the right thing, then all you have to do is live with the consequences of it.’”(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)

The Los Angeles Chargers proved on Sunday that they can finally hang on to a lead. The next step is making sure opponents don't make it too close at the end.


  Los Angeles had a 31-13 lead midway through the third quarter against the Jets before New York was able to rally a bit. They were within one score at 34-26 and drove to the Chargers 32 with under a minute remaining before turning over the ball on downs.


  The Chargers gave up a safety in the final seconds to make the final score 34-28 and snap a three-game losing streak to improve to 3-7.


  "Even though we didn't finish the way we wanted to, we still won the game so it's better than the alternative," coach Anthony Lynn said.


  The Chargers are one of the league's best teams in the first half. They have outscored teams by 40 points in the first and second quarters -- the eighth- best differential in the league -- and their defense has allowed a league-low average of 134.3 yards.

WHAT'S WORKING
 The Eagles are running the ball effectively until Pederson stops calling runs. They had 96 yards in the first half on 19 attempts, but only ran six times in the second half in a one-possession game for the most part. Miles Sanders had 63 yards on 11 carries in the first half, but only 3 yards on five runs in the second.
 NEEDS HELP
 Philly's wide receivers aren't getting open enough and hardly make any contested catches. Wentz targeted his wideouts 17 times against Cleveland, getting only eight completions for 69 yards. Jeffery mistimed a jump on a pass inside the 10 in the fourth quarter and it went for an easy interception.
 STOCK UP
 Linebacker Alex Singleton had 11 tackles, one sack, one fumble recovery, one quarterback hit and one tackle for loss. Singleton was signed by Seattle as an undrafted free agent out of Montana State in 2015. He was cut by the Seahawks, Patriots and Vikings, excelled in two seasons in the Canadian Football League and signed with Philly last year. Singleton made his first career start in Week 6.
 "Alex has been a big bright spot for us," Pederson said. "He's played a ton of snaps obviously on defense. He's a core teams player, great leader, great energy giver, just somebody that has really embraced his role."
 STOCK DOWN
 Wide receiver Travis Fulgham has two catches on 12 targets in the past two games after an excellent stretch of five games. He had 28 catches for 427 yards and four TDs after debuting with the Eagles on Oct. 4. His decline in production coincides with Jeffery's return. Jeffery has zero catches in two games.
 "I'm not worried about Alshon's presence right now. I'm concerned about Travis' production and getting him better and helping him get better," Pederson said. "He needs to get better. As I've mentioned, we all have enough to do, enough work to do, and obviously he is part of that group."
 INJURED
 Right tackle Lane Johnson (shoulder) and cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc (ankle) didn't finish the game at Cleveland. Tight end Zach Ertz (ankle) is getting closer to returning.
 KEY NUMBER
 2 for 12 -- After going 0 for 9 on third down in a loss to the Giants, the Eagles weren't much better. They converted just twice in 12 tries.
 NEXT STEPS
 The Eagles host the Seattle Seahawks (7-3) on Monday. They're 3-0 in prime- time games but are 0-5 against Russell Wilson, including a 17-9 loss in an NFC wild-card game last January.

Again, turn overs and a decision to go for it on fourth down in the fourth quarter in field goal range was a questionable call when you have in my opinion the best field goal kicker, especially in doors standing on the sideline. I guess the Injury to Crosby may have come into play, but he could have nailed it and put the Packers in position to win it at the end of regulation. I also have to remember though that Rogers had a wide open Tunyan on third down in the red zone in regulation, but he decided to go to Davante Adams, which, why wouldn’t you for the win?
 In the end, the Packers have to play a full four quarters to beat a good team that is well coached.
 I saw that Marquez Valdes-Scantling, who had a great game other than the fumble that led to the Colts victory got death threats over the turnover, and for that I have to ask... .REALLY?
 In the end it is just a game people. I mean don’t get me wrong, I love my Packers, but to do that to an elite athlete who most of us couldn’t tie his shoes is absolutely ridiculous! Even though he gets paid money to make plays, which he did all game long. I don’t think that the one play deserves anyone to treat a human like that.
 Anyway, rant over! With basketball underway I am anxious to see what the season brings after break. I know schools will probably have to make some big decision as winter seasons are up in the air. I just remind you be open minded and safe when dealing with the protocols being put in place to allow these kids to play sports.

The question I had was the late decision to not attempt the field goal and get within striking distance in the fourth quarter. I guess when you are playing great defense, that is the call you make but I really thought we attempt the field goal and give yourself a chance to win it in the end.
 Speaking of field goals. The Packers did everything the could to lose to the Colts Sunday in Indianapolis. I mean, what a first half and then..... the second half happened.
 How do you beat Green Bay you ask? Keep Aaron Rogers off the field! The Colts did just that as the offense took very few snaps in the third quarter. I mean Frank Reich and Philip Rivers were destined to be together as both have that old school mentality. Add in a running game of Jonathan Taylor, who we as Badger fans have seen doing what he did Saturday in the Red and White and the Colts came out with the overtime victory.
