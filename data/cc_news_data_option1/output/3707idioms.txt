DRUG offences are at an all time high in Kingaroy with an up to two week waiting lists to get in to a drug diversion program.
 First time offenders are now being sent to sessions in Nanango as the Kingaroy sessions are full.
 In the 2015-16 financial year Kingaroy had 313 drug offences, followed by 616 in the following two years.
 In the past two years Kingaroy has had 1540 drug offences.
 Dangerous drug supply charges have also sky rocketed from 12 in 2017 and 2018 to 231 in 2019.
 Kingaroy senior sergeant Dave Tierney said over the past two years they have had a number of big drug operations targeting certain people.
 “This is the highest number of people we have had going through these programs and as a result they have had to set up another drug diversion program in Nanango,” Sen Sgt Tierney said.
 “Figures are far higher then previous years, which I would put down to better police work and information from the public.
 “The drug diversion programs are the best shot to try and rehabilitate people and it really comes down to whether or not they want to take the program on board.”
 Police in the region have been taking a holistic approach towards dealing with crime by having more informal and formal meetings with police from various stations as well as the different community organisations in the region.
 By working closely with community organisations such as South Burnett Care and CTC, police are trying to get people the help they need before they enter the court system.
 While police have been focusing their attention to fighting the drug problem in the region, Sen Sgt Tierney said the lack of resources available to help people also contributes to the drug statistics.
 “A lot of organisations out here have been pushing hard for more mental health resources and due to the lack of support services a lot of people turn to drugs,” he said.
 “We focus on working with various organisations in the community to keep people out of the courts, we work with child services, parole and probation, CTC and South Burnett Care to try and get people the help they need.
 “Most of these organisations rely on government money and grants and that is why we had to open another drug diversion program in Nanango because they were run off their feet in Kingaroy.
 “By sharing intel between the different officers in charge at all of the stations in the South Burnett we are able to make more arrests and that is certainly one reason drug offences are up.”

Plantar eucaliptos en una zona de pinos, no pedir permiso a la administracion para reforestar con esta especie mas de cinco hectareas, situar arboles sin respetar el perimetro de seguridad de las casas o en suelo urbanizable violan la normativa forestal gallega y acarrean multas para quien comete esas infracciones de 100 euros hasta un millon, aunque en la mayoria de casos las advertencias de la administracion son suficientes para que encarrilen sus terrenos hacia la legalidad y eviten el castigo economico. De hecho, solo uno de cada cinco apercibimientos por plantaciones o reforestaciones ilegales acaban en una sancion.
 Durante el periodo 2016-2019, la Conselleria de Medio Rural emitio 6.268 apercibimientos a dueños de fincas forestales al detectar que sus plantaciones incumplian alguna de las normas recogidas en la Ley de Montes de 2012, que establece, por ejemplo, que los troncos deberan distar, si son frondosas, entre 15 y 30 metros de viviendas, urbanizaciones o instalaciones industriales a menos de 400 metros del monte y fuera del suelo urbano y del nucleo rural.
 Sin embargo, los propietarios esquivan el 80% de multas ajustando sus terrenos y cultivos a la norma. El motivo es el procedimiento administrativo. Cuando efectivos de Medio Rural -o le remiten denuncia concellos u otras entidades- detectan una irregularidad en esta cuestion, envian al propietario una carta alertandole de la situacion y abriendo un plazo para que lo subsane. Despues, la administracion comprueba si lo ha hecho y en caso de no ser asi le comunica la apertura de un expediente, que puede acabar en una sancion economica o no, en funcion de cada situacion.
 La normativa gallega establece para estos casos un amplio abanico de castigos economicos, pues las multas leves oscilan entre los 100 y los 1.000 euros; las graves, entre los 1.001 y los 100.000; y las muy graves, entre los 100.001 y el millon.
 El principal problema en este terreno reside en la falta de respeto a las distancias exigidas respecto a terrenos agricolas, construcciones o infraestructuras, una infraccion de caracter grave, segun la Ley de Montes y que conlleva, por tanto, castigos economicos de 1.001 a 100.000 euros. Casi el 73% de los apercibimientos enviados por Medio Rural a propietarios por incorrectas reforestaciones o plantaciones estan relacionados con esta cuestion, segun el ultimo Anuario de Estadistica Forestal elaborado por el departamento que dirige Jose Gonzalez, que no disponia ayer de los datos sobre el importe que supusieron las casi 1.300 sanciones impuestas entre 2016 y 2019.
 La mayor parte de casos se solucionan tras esa llamada al orden, pero aun asi, el incumplimiento de las distancias legales supone la mitad de multas tramitadas durante los ultimos cuatro años, pues suman 182 respecto a terrenos agricolas y 442 respecto a otras construcciones o propiedades.
 Por provincias, destaca el escaso peso de Pontevedra, por debajo incluso de la proporcion del 14,7% que tiene de la superficie forestal gallega. Asi, acumula apenas 373 apercibimientos y 108 multas, por los 3.996y 666 de A Coruña (29% de superficie forestal), los 1.856 y 257 de Lugo (34%) y los 43 y 131 de Ourense (21%), respectivamente. Este ultimo caso se explica por el hecho de que haya sanciones resueltas un año heredadas de ejercicios previos a 2016.

The goal seemed to provide a much-needed confidence injection for the 'Caps.
 Just minutes later, the squad put together a nice sequence that saw David Milinkovic get the ball to Dajome at the top of the box. The Colombian international sent a right-footed shot in past a diving Diop to put Vancouver up 2-0 in the 44th minute.
 Montreal responded in the 70th minute when Taider sent a pass to Quioto in front of the 'Caps net. The Honduran midfielder got a left-footed shot off under pressure, placing it in the top-right corner of the net and cutting the Impact's deficit to one.
 Montero struck again in the 78th minute, collecting a drop pass from Leonard Owusu and sending a rocket past Diop.
 The Colombian striker nearly had another tally two minutes later, but missed the net. His disappointment was visible as he pulled his jersey over his face.
 The loss means Montreal will not have a chance to defend their Canadian Championship title this year. The Impact took home the Voyageurs Cup last season after beating Toronto on penalties in the final.
 TFC beat both the Impact and the Whitecaps twice to finish atop the round- robin portion of this year's tournament.
 Who Toronto will face in the final will be determined Saturday, when Hamilton's Forge FC will take on Halifax's HFX Wanderers in the finale of the Canadian Premier League season.

Nonetheless, much uncertainty lies ahead, and Suga will face two immediate hurdles. First, he must visibly establish his own leadership style. Whereas many of Suga’s predecessors as prime minister – including Abe and Taro Aso – hailed from well-known political (even aristocratic) families, Suga comes from a solid middle-class background. Although Suga proved himself an extremely capable manager as Abe’s cabinet secretary, his new role will require him not only to administer, but also to lead. Rather than pulling strings behind the scenes with elite bureaucrats, Suga must inspire the country. His first test will be to lead the government’s response to the pandemic, because the Abe administration’s confusing signals as to whether more restrictions are preferable to more economic activity – or, indeed, the reverse – have often bewildered the Japanese public. Suga’s second hurdle will be to consolidate power within his party. He was elected LDP leader with the support of the party’s major factions, but does not belong to any of them. Once he has appointed his cabinet, the LDP’s internal rivalries and fissures will likely re-emerge.

Morris County’s first-ever Drive-In Drag Show was great fun, with performances, prizes, and all manner of socially distanced pleasures.
 But the event raised serious themes as well, with messages about community issues like trans lives, Black lives, and Latinx lives.
 Morris County PRIDE presented the show on Sept. 12 in Madison, N.J. The TriVersity Center for Gender and Sexual Diversity, based in Milford, Pa., was among the sponsors for the event.
 Before the drive-in event was a drag show held at Tequila 55 in Dover, N.J., and filmed by Melissa and Adrienne Longo of Electric Love Studio. Recorded over two days, the show featured professional drag performers and some consciousness-raising.
 Attendees decorated their cars to win a one-of-a-kind drag-themed trophy created exclusively this socially distanced night of pride, performance, education, and community building.
 During the break in the performance, Star Dust won the Drag in the Bag prize for the best drag event performance. Lelo was awarded the Proudest Dragster award for the best-decorated car.
 Morris County PRIDE was formed to combat stigma and discrimination faced by the local LGBTQ+ community. While the original plan for 2020 included an all- day festival, the pandemic forced organizers to write a new script for the event.
 “It is important in these times to continue to bring the community together responsibly,” said lead organizer Cara Parmigiani of Morris Plains, N.J., a TriVersity member.
 Many brought folding chairs, positioning them near the vehicles so that everyone could sit outside. People danced both inside and outside of their cars. Each car left with a goody bag full of swag and educational materials provided by the show’s sponsors.

Tennis champion Venus Williams spends _a lot_ of time under the sun, so the woman knows sunscreen. Yet, she couldn't find the formula she was looking for: a clean, mineral option that worked on all skin tones, never leaving chalkiness or a white cast behind. So, she partnered with The Sunscreen Company to create two sunscreens of her very own. The Unrivaled Sun Serum SPF 35 melds sun protection with skin care, since the serum sinks right into skin with a flawless matte finish, giving it primer power as well. The lightweight serum has 25 percent zinc oxide for reef-safe, broad-spectrum sun protection, while multitasking prickly pear hydrates, calms and soothes skin.

The Dodgers opened a 3 1/2-game lead in their quest for an eighth straight NL West title by beating the Padres for the second straight day. Dustin May threw 5 1/3 gutty innings out of the bullpen, AJ Pollock and Chris Taylor homered and Will Smith drove in three runs.
 “I’m celebrating by saying I’m proud of our guys and it was a great series,” said Roberts, who grew up in northern San Diego County and both played for and was a coach with the Padres before getting the Dodgers' job. "I think it caught us all by surprise because we were so focused on trying to win this series. I think word will travel once we get on the plane.”
 San Diego, quieted by Dodgers pitching a second straight game even as it heads for its first playoff berth since winning the division in 2006, has lost two straight for the first time since mid-August.
 May confirmed that as part of COVID-19 protocols, MLB doesn't want teams having wild clubhouse celebrations after clinching.
 Asked if the Dodgers had a celebration, he said:
 “No. We’re not allowed to.”
 But clinching a postseason spot “is something you grind for for the whole season,” he said. "This season is different but we had to grind in the quarantine zone, so you're still going to feel super excited.”
 At 35-15, the Dodgers breezed into the expanded 16-team postseason field. Los Angeles is seeking its first World Series title since 1988, having lost in the Fall Classic under Roberts in 2017 and 2018.
 Mookie Betts tied his career high with three stolen bases, had two hits and scored a run.
 San Diego, quieted by Dodgers pitching a second straight game even as it heads for its first playoff berth since winning the division in 2006, has lost two straight for the first time since mid-August.
 “Today we just got beat in almost all areas, facets of the game," rookie manager Jayce Tingler said. “We didn’t play as clean as we have been defensively. Their guys over there on the mound, they’ve done a good job pitching, especially the past two days. It was nice to scrap and crawl and fight back in it, but at the end of the day we got into too big a hole to overcome.”
 May, who had been scheduled to start before Roberts decided to go with a bullpen day, was the Dodgers' third pitcher of the game. He went 5 1/3 innings and was in control until Jurickson Profar homered to right field with two outs in the seventh to pull the Padres to 7-3. Mitch Moreland reached on an error by second baseman Gavin Lux opening the inning.
 After Profar’s homer, May struck out Trent Grisham and blew off some steam by yelling a few profanities that could be heard around empty Petco Park. Grisham angered the Dodgers by briefly posing at the plate after homering off Clayton Kershaw in the Padres' 7-2 win Monday night.
 May allowed Manny Machado’s solo homer with one out in the eighth, his 14th, and was lifted by Roberts.
