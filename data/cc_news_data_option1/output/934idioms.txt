Lastly and most importantly, our students are hungry! Very cynically, I am forced to agree with the Snickers Tag line, “You’re not you, when you’re hungry”. Many students go to school without breakfast or dinner, lunch often being the only meal that they consume. How do they cope on the weekends or holidays when school is not in session? Mind you, the Government has offered solutions – the PATH programme and the Jamaica Moves Initiative in schools. Let’s be realistic, are these programmes covering every student in need? Maybe the criteria for the PATH programme needs to be reviewed to facilitate a larger number of students – and in retrospect, do we have the resources to accommodate this increasing demand? How do you expect students to be well- behaved and disciplined when they literally have food for thoughts?

Wyoming is one of two states in the U.S. that doesn’t recognize softball as a sanctioned sport, until now. Because of the efforts of coaches, girls, board members, parents and fans from across the state, beginning in March of 2021 Lady Tiger softball players will take the field for their inaugural season.
 Currently 13 schools from around the state have committed to junior varsity and varsity teams including Cody, Rock Springs, Green River, Natrona, Kelly Walsh and Worland in the West and Wheatland, Thunder Basin, Gillette, Cheyenne East, Cheyenne South, Cheyenne Central and Laramie in the East. Athletic directors around the state are currently working on a schedule, official rules, practice/game facilities and hiring coaches. For those of us in the League, it can’t come soon enough!

 Toronto has the second-best record in the East behind the Bucks, and after Milwaukee failed to put them away after having a 2-0 lead in the conference finals last season, the Raptors might still have a mental edge.

 After a thrilling victory to punch their ticket to the Class 4A state tournament, the Waukee High School boys basketball team will be seeking a repeat performance in their state tournament opener.
 Set within the confines of Wells Fargo Arena, the Warriors (21-2) enter as Class 4A's fourth-seeded team preceded only by Iowa City West as the third seed, Cedar Falls as the second seed, and Ankeny Centennial as the top-seeded team in the bracket. For Waukee's first-round match-up, the will be battling the fifth-seeded North Scott Lancers (22-1).
 It will be a state tournament rematch as both these teams squared off in the consolation match-up from last season. This is a match-up that could very well be named the tournament battle as the only two times these squads have faced off in the past have been at the state tournament. Waukee ended up taking the most recent battle in last years' state consolation contest.
 The 2019-20 edition will feature a tale of two different styles of play. Waukee comes into the tournament averaging 71.7 points per game which ranks as the top mark in the Class 5A field. They will battle a North Scott team who ranks second in the field in top defense with the second-fewest points allowed across the Class 5A field (904 points). Teams have averaged just 39 points per contest against the Lancers. That presents an intriguing round-one match-up as one of the best Class 5A defenses against the top scoring offense in the bracket.
 Aside from the scoring totals, this battle seems pretty even on paper as Waukee's shooting efficiency slightly out-draws North Scott 53 percent to 49 percent. If you were looking for another edge in Waukee's favor, it would come in the rebounding category where the Warriors average 32 rebounds per contest compared to 25 for the Lancers.
 Defensively, Waukee will have to focus on North Scott senior Tytan Anderson. The senior averages 18.5 points per game on 57 percent shooting from the floor while also posting up a team-best 9.4 rebounds per game. The Warriors will answer with junior sharpshooter Tucker DeVries who enters averaging 21.8 points per game which ranks second among all Class 5A scorers. DeVries also averages a team-leading 4.9 assists per battle.
 The battle will take place on Tuesday, Mar. 10 as the Warriors and the Lancers will tangle at Wells Fargo Arena beginning at 6:30 p.m.

Donkeys are the beast of burden in Kenya; because of their strength and endurance donkeys can carry heavy loads and contribute to a family’s income in remote communities. If a family has no donkey it means the wife and the out- of-school children do the donkey work; the donkey provides the cash income for the family. A 2019 report by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (KALRO) found that the donkey ranked as more important compared to chickens, goats, sheep, cows and ducks. Kenya’s 1 million remaining donkeys are essential for water provision, agriculture, transport of people and goods as well as other income-generating activities; the average income per donkey in a rural community is US$110 per month.

It’s a similar threat to that dawning on the U.S., as an unfolding outbreak at a nursing home in a Seattle suburb has killed at least ten and infected dozens of others. Nursing homes across the U.S. and the millions who live in them, as well as their relatives, are on edge.
 The elderly and those with underlying conditions are particularly vulnerable to the virus, which has killed more than 3,400 worldwide and spread to more than 100,000 people in nearly 100 countries.
 In China, where the vast majority of the deaths have occurred, doctors reported fatality rates of nearly 15% for those 80 years of age or older, compared to 2.3% overall. Those with existing heart disease, diabetes or respiratory problems have also been several times more likely to die.
 Facilities and institutions where the already weakened are living in close quarters are ideal breeding grounds for pathogens in the best of times.
 But calamities — epidemics, natural disasters and wars — have a way of further exposing a society’s fault lines. The current outbreak raging across South Korea, some activists and advocates say, is an overdue wake-up call casting light on the country’s reliance on institutionalization as a way of caring for its most vulnerable and forcing a reckoning on the conditions in which they are housed.
 “It’s not the virus that’s cruel to the weak,” a South Korean newspaper posited last week. “It’s our society, civic groups say, that’s shoved them into isolated environments ideal for the virus to thrive.”
 The psych ward in the hospital where seven have died and nearly all patients have been infected has in particular raised alarm, as photos and details emerged about how patients have lived for decades with little prospect of healing or leaving.
 A task force of physicians at South Korea’s National Medical Center overseeing the response to the coronavirus outbreak said the ward had no beds, patients spending most of their days on thin futons on the floor — not a typical standard of care for South Korea.

Given that the virus is sweeping through the upper-echelons of power in Tehran and its front-line operation in hospitals, Guard members may too come down with COVID-19.

Voters must choose to vote on either the Democratic or Republican ballots.
 While 10 Democrats will be listed on the ballot in the race for president, Super Tuesday culled the runners, making the contest mostly between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
 Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race last Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar quit Monday, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg quit after a poor Super Tuesday showing, as did Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who suspended her campaign on Thursday.
 Buttigieg, Bloomberg, Klobuchar and Deval Patrick, whose name also will be on the ballot despite quitting his presidential campaign, have all endorsed Biden.
 Biden leads the race with 627 delegates, while Sanders has 551. U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, the only other candidate in the race, has just two delegates. It takes 1,990 to win the nomination.
 Biden, who was vice president to President Barak Obama from 2008 to 2016, will visit New Hope Church in Jackson on Sunday. Sanders had planned to come to Jackson on Friday but canceled and moved his efforts to Michigan.
 Sanders previously gained a lot of momentum in early primary contests, but Biden surged during Super Tuesday, locking down every Southern state that voted. Gabbard’s two delegates both came from American Samoa.
 On the Republican side, President Donald J. Trump is the odds-on favorite with 833 delegates, leaving his opponents, former Massachusetts governor and libertarian running mate Bill Weld with one delegate and Mexican-American businessman Roque “Rocky” De La Fuente with none.
 Tuesday’s primaries will also include the prelude to a U.S. Senate race that is likely to end up as a repeat of the 2018 contest between Democrat Mike Espy and Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith.

 Demolition of damaged sites is slated for May, with construction to begin soon after. Estimated completion of the complex is scheduled for August 2021, coinciding with the beginning of a new school year.
 During the meantime, district officials “have been busy selecting our construction managers, completing topographical surveys, and meeting with our architects. During those meetings, it became evident that a few changes would need to be made to our original design,” West announced on the district's Facebook Page.
 “Changes were based on several things: Our strict timeline for completion of the project, drainage concerns working around our existing structures and the safety of the students next year during construction,” according to the post.
 The revised design includes “a complete renovation band hall and math wing classrooms; covered walkways will be constructed helping our students transition safely to and from the cafeteria, gymnasium and band hall,” the post noted.
 Goodwin Lasiter Strong was chosen as the project's architect, while construction managers are with the firm Berry Construction, West said.

As the chaos built, Hall’s default response was to put prisons on indefinite lockdowns, which only contributed to the tensions within the cell blocks. As her tenure wound down, the prisons exploded with violence that claimed several lives and damaged one of the inmate housing units at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman so badly that it had to be abandoned.
 Tate Reeves, Bryant’s successor who took office two months ago, hopefully won’t repeat that mistake when he names the next permanent corrections chief. But he legally could, because state law does not require the corrections commissioner to necessarily have corrections experience.
 As the state has discovered, this is a bad law and needs to be changed.
 In the meantime, Reeves can learn from Bryant’s hiring mistakes, and the Legislature can pay more attention to warnings of trouble.
 Mississippi needs a corrections professional in the job, someone who knows how to recruit and train guards, how to deal with gangs and how to persuade lawmakers to put the resources into prisons to keep them safe and fully staffed. It should go without saying that the other expectation is that the candidate be incorruptible.
 This is going to be one of the most important hires that the new governor will make. He has to get it right.

Iowa is a great place to live and work, but the state needs to do more to be more competitive with other states in the country if it's going to attract more people to live and work here, leaders of the Iowa Business Council said Friday.
   
 The Iowa Business Council released its annual competitive dashboard earlier this month, measuring how Iowa is doing in five metrics which measure the state's overall economic health. Those categories are economic growth, education and workforce, governance, health and wellness, and demographics and diversity. In all the categories Iowa ranked average, except for demographics and diversity, where it ranked poor.
   
 The nonpartisan council, founded in 1985, is comprised of members in each of the state's 99 counties, with member companies employing more than 163,000 people with a payroll of more than $7.5 billion. The group had more than $3.2 billion capital investments in 2019, $1.5 billion on research and development, contributed more than $76 million to charity and spent more than $26 million in education and training. It also releases its economic dashboard each year to evaluate the state's economic well-being.
   
 Reynolds Cramer, CEO and president of Boone-based Fareway Stores Inc. and a member of the council, said average rankings in areas, such as economic growth, education and workforce, governance and health and wellness, is "disappointing."
   
 "It sets the tone for the state and the people who live here that we have things we need to do to get better than average," said Cramer, who called the state's poor ranking in demographics and diversity, "unfortunate."
   
 Joe Murphy, the council's executive director, spoke to the Ames Economic Development Commission Board Friday morning, and later in the day said during an interview with the Tribune that the dashboard helps business leaders take action and propose policies to make the necessary improvements.
   
 "This report is meant to highlight areas that we can improve on," Murphy said.
   
 A positive found in the report, Murphy said, was the state's gross state product, which remained consistent in 2019 compared to the year before.
   
 "In a year with so many trade disputes and horrific weather events, the fact we were able to stay consistent and not lose ground is a telling point on how resilient the Iowa economy is," Murphy said.
   
 Recommendations in the report for the categories include:
   
 Economic growth
   
 Support increased investment to the State Housing Trust and Workforce Housing Tax Credit programs. "The availability of adequate housing for the overall labor market leads directly to the community's ability to attract and retain a diverse and growing workforce," the report stated.
   
 Education and workforce
   
 Continue support for the Future Ready Iowa initiative and fund the Last Dollar Scholarship and Employer Innovation Fund to help the current workforce develop skills for high-demand jobs; work with community colleges and four-year colleges to streamline the state's talent pipeline; and work with K-12 schools to develop solutions to provide work-based learning for all students.
   
 Governance
   
 Advocate for resources that lead to a healthy climate for people to live, work and play; and evaluate proposals to look to build access to affordable housing, childcare and mental health resources.
   
 Health and wellness
   
 Continue support of the Healthiest State Initiative; support efforts to attract and retain more primary care doctors and to maximize telemedicine strategies to increase healthcare access statewide.
   
 Demographics and diversity
   
 Set a goal of increasing Iowa's net migration, while continuing to conduct research to help in determining future policy initiatives to speed growth while partnering with stakeholders and organizations.
   
 Cramer said his company has taken measures in recent years, such as restricting and banning smoking on its Boone campus, to help improve employee health, but Fareway also partners with local healthcare organizations such as Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames for a bigger local impact rather than joining a larger, broader initiative.
   
 Murphy said the council partners with health and wellness groups across the state and is a strong proponent of increased mental health funding, which he said was, "in our legislative agenda for the first time this year."
   
 Murphy said paying attention and working to improve employee well-being, while "outside of the traditional business area," is the "right thing to do."
   
 The council is also continuing its support of comprehensive immigration reform to help create a better path to citizenship for professionals seeking to come to Iowa to work from other countries.
   
 Cramer described the current path to citizenship as "going down a tunnel where there is no light at the end. It's very difficult and cumbersome."
   
 He said many people who come to the country on a work visa find themselves in limbo, not knowing what their future will hold.
   
 "I wish the path could be made more simple (with more) consistency, (that) would be the best thing going," Cramer said.
   
 Murphy said he hopes people don't focus too much on the numbers contained in the report, but instead on the importance of measuring the state's overall economic health.
   
 "Iowa is a great state to live in," he said. "It gets high marks, and things are getting accomplished, but what are we going to do to get people to live here and work here? It starts with good housing, daycare opportunities, services, education, and to me that's what I hope people will take away from this, that they don't get focused on a number, but instead why we're talking about these things."

At Seoul’s Jongmyo Park, the usual crowds of seniors milling about for company, free meals and games of Go had thinned out but not disappeared. Signs taped to a wall and a pathway said Go games were banned indefinitely as a coronavirus prevention measure; regardless, a half dozen games were in full swing nearby.
 Kim Young-bae, 84, wearing a flat cap and face mask and enjoying the afternoon sun on a bench in the park, was unfazed. He remembered a time after the war when an illness would hit a village and dozens would die at a time, so much so there wasn’t enough cloth to wrap the bodies.
 His wife is refusing to leave their home, terrified of the virus, he said. She’s stopped going to the daytime discotheque that’s a popular pastime for seniors.
 “Does it matter, whether you die locked up in your home, or walking around?” he asked. “Whenever it is, we all go some time.”

We don’t know exactly what Joe Biden’s campaign theme is but perhaps he ought to think about this one: “Those of you who have been knocked down, those of you who have been knocked out, this is your campaign.” He said that after his success with voters in Super Tuesday’s primaries in 14 states in which he came out the winner in the Democratic presidential primaries.
 He now is the front-runner in a race that has narrowed to two candidates, Biden and Bernie Sanders. Biden has reasons to be showing more confidence as he has said all along in the campaign that he has the best chance of beating Republican President Donald Trump. He’s probably right on that point.
 He also has many African Americans in his campaign ship. The three candidates who dropped out after Super Tuesday, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, all have endorsed Biden, which gives the former vice president an added surge. Elizabeth Warren dropped out Thursday but has not endorsed Biden.

Henry County Sheriff’s Capt. Wayne Davis said the documents were not made available "in an effort to protect the integrity of the investigation."
 Perry has said the mountain of evidence his investigators collected included "dozens of interviews, some in South Carolina and other locations."
 On Friday, Nester said that information is still under wraps.
 "There is very little to nothing I can say,” he said. “This is a trial by jury, and I cannot comment about anything that likely will affect anything."
 Essie Handy of Ridgeway, Hopkins-Pequignot's sister, told the Martinsville Bulletin in January 2018 that a sheriff's official told her Hopkins-Pequignot was asleep when she was murdered and that some family members had observed blood all over the mattress after her death.
 Fisher said after the proceeding on Thursday that the newly presented evidence could have a "big impact" on the case. Fisher did not return a phone call seeking additional comment on Friday.
 Nester downplayed the new evidence as the reasoning for Williams’ allowing Pequignot to be released with conditions.
 "Part of the agreement includes the speedy trial statute," he said, and Pequignot has been held behind bars as long as the law allows.
 An offer of release under bond extends the amount of time a trial may be delayed.
 Pequignot is scheduled to be back in court on March 16, when a new trial date is expected to be set.
 Nester said as of Friday, Pequignot remained in the Henry County Jail.
 "They have to order the EHM [Electronic Home Monitoring] he said. "I think they come from Colorado."

HUXLEY -- This time Ballard isn't satisfied with just being there.
   
 Last year the Bombers made state for the first time since 2005, only to get overpowered by Norwalk in the Class 3A quarterfinals, 81-39.
   
 This year they want to play all the way through Friday at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.
   
 "Our mindset as a team is we believe we can do damage," Ballard sophomore Ashton Hermann said. "We can win at least one game and we're going to be competitive."
   
 Ballard enters its second-consecutive state tournament as the fifth seed in 3A with an 18-6 record. Their opponent - fourth seed Center Point-Urbana - is also 18-6.
   
 "They've got pieces - a little bit of everything," Ballard coach Jeff Schertz said. "They've got guys that guard - they do a lot of man-to-man - and they've got guys that can score. They play incredibly hard."
   
 CPU was co-champion in the West Division of the WaMaC Conference, tying Clear Creek-Amana with a 14-5 conference record. The Stormin Pointers defeated Marion, 78-70, in the substate finals to reach state.
   
 CPU boasts a balanced offense and averages 56 points per game while shooting 47 percent from the field and 64 percent from the line. The Stormin Pointers are only allowing 41.5 points per game.
   
 "There are times when they've not shot it well," Schertz said. "But there are also times when they've been really good. They're obviously playing well right now."
   
 Senior center Kole Tupa is the only Stormin Pointer to average in double figures. Tupa stands at 6-foot-5 and averages 14.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game and he's shooting 57.5 percent from the field and 67 percent from the line.
   
 "They've got a big guy inside that does a lot for them," Schertz said. "He's a lefty and can shoot it from the perimeter, is pretty good around the goal, gets offensive rebounds - he's probably their best player."
   
 Senior Caleb Andrews is averaging 9.4 points and junior Trey Johannes 7.5. Andrews leads the team in 3-pointers with 22 and Johannes has taken advantage of his 6-foot-4 frame to shoot 60 percent from the field with 15 3-pointers.
   
 "They've got a couple of other guys with a lot of length," Schertz said. "They both can shoot the 3."
   
 Senior Alex Wade averages 4.9 points and 3.3 assists. Ethan Sells averages 5.0 points and leads the team in steals at 1.5 per game and Keegan Koopedryer averages 5.7 points and 4.3 rebounds.
   
 Ballard enters state with a lot of confidence. The Bombers have won 16 of 19 games since a 2-3 start and won the Raccoon River Conference outright.
   
 In substate play the Bombers whipped Webster City then won a 73-71 overtime thriller over Algona to reach the finals, where they faced off against Clear Lake for the right to go to state.
   
 Leading scorer and rebounder Connor Drew spent most of the second half against Clear Lake on the bench in foul trouble, allowing the Lions to cut a 10-point Bomber lead to 49-48 late in the third quarter. But Ballard didn't flinch, easily overcoming the adversity to pull off a 65-56 victory.
   
 "I don't call a lot of timeouts," Schertz said. "I've let the guys kind of play through tougher situations. I feel like it's paying off now. We've got to be able to play within the flow of the game and be able to adjust and I like that about these guys."
   
 At state Schertz expects to stick with what got his team to the dance. But he isn't afraid to mix it up a little.
   
 "We have found our identity," Schertz said. "It would probably not be very smart to all of the sudden try and be something else. Having said that, we haven't just tried to stay the same. There was some stuff we did defensively the other night that we hadn't done all year and some stuff offensively two games ago that we hadn't done all year."
   
 The Bombers are averaging 68.8 points shooting 48 percent from the field, 37 percent from 3-point range and 70.5 percent from the line. Ballard is also strong defensively, giving up an average of 55.6 points.
   
 "Defense is a big aspect of our team," Drew said. "We've just got to keep playing defense if we're not scoring well."
   
 Drew is putting up 18.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. Hermann has been the hottest Bomber down the stretch and is averaging 15.8 points and 2.7 steals on the season.
   
 "I'm focused on our team," Hermann said. "I want to do as much as I can to help our team win. I like playing as a family."
   
 Junior point guard Mason Murphy makes everything go for Ballard. Murphy only scored three points against Clear Lake, but he had nine assists and is averaging 7.0 points and 5.5 assists.
   
 "I try my best to get Connor the ball and Ashton the ball in good spots where they can score," Murphy said. "Nobody really helps out on me, so it's easy for me to drive and find the open guys."
   
 But Ballard has plenty of other weapons.
   
 At 6-foot-5, Krogh forms a lethal tandem with Drew in the low post, averaging 7.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and nearly two blocks. He scored 14 points and pulled down nine rebounds in the win over Clear Lake.
   
 Reinertson averages 6.2 points and 2.7 rebounds and he scored 13 points against Clear Lake. Senior Nic Edwards puts up 4.5 points per game and has made 24 3-pointers and Sam Petersen averages 3.4 points and scored 12 in the dramatic victory over Algona.
   
 "Anyone can step up," Murphy said. "Sam did against Algona. Kade stepped up against Clear Lake."
   
 Beating CPU is Ballard's focus heading into state. But if the Bombers can pull that game off, top-ranked Norwalk and Bowen Born - a UNI recruit averaging 37.5 points per game - could be waiting for them in the semifinals.
   
 "We'll take any opponent we have to take," Drew said. "If Norwalk is in our path we'll just have to take them down. We ain't scared of nobody. It's the state tournament. Time to make a run."
   
 Ballard's quarterfinal game with CPU will start at 1 p.m. Tuesday at Wells Fargo Arena.

 Kapenguria Heroes will now lock horns with former national secondary schools champions Laiser Hill Academy from Kajiado in Sunday’s final. Laiser Hill Academy edged out Tumkas from Uasin Gishu 2-0 in the other semi-final.
 Kapenguria Heroes, under tutelage of Elvis Mwanga, opened the scores through Alfred Tanui who, after receiving a fine cross from Wesley Mutai, headed home in the 16th minute.
 But their joy was short-lived when White Rhinos’ Tyson Kapchanga levelled after dribbling past the entire defence and lobbing the ball past an advancing goalkeeper in the 33rd minute.
 But Wesley Tanui sealed the fate of the losers when he converted from a Tanui corner kick in the 48th minute to ensure his team proceed to the final.

Rather than building a huge, expensive, and very complicated rocket carrying a smaller space ship--like the powerful Saturn did in the Apollo missions--the Constellation program will use two rockets to send a larger spacecraft. The first rocket will carry the lunar lander along with a propulsion stage into Earth orbit. The second one, the Ares I launch vehicle, will carry the Orion spaceship with the astronauts on board, which will be rendezvous with the lunar lander in orbit and dock. Once docked, the propulsion stage will push the combined craft to the moon and some lucky, smart, and courageous astronaut would be able to say: "It may not be the first step, and it certainly won't be the last one."

Here are my favorite ways to show love, teach love and love on purpose!
       1. Figure out your children’s love language. We all have a certain love language that ignites our soul more then other acts of love. My 5-year-old desperately needs snuggles as much as my 8-year-old needs quality time. Figure out what your family members need and fill the love tanks accordingly. I’ll love them both in 100 different ways a day, but knowing how they feel love best allows me to love them the way their little hearts desperately need.       2. Create a healthy narrative about yourself and your identity and radiate that in front of your children. If we body shame ourselves, they will come to quickly fall victim to finding their worth in a body that will inevitably diminish the older they get. We must speak positive truths. Their inner voice is being shaped right now by the words we speak about ourselves. Self love matters. Toddlers don’t walk around talking about everything they’d change about themselves. They walk around with their hands on their hips like they own the place. At some point, they learn there are things about themselves that people may not like. We can love our children by loving their flaws, and by loving ours too.       3. Slow down. This is key in a society that thrives on the hustle. It’s so easy to get lost in the sauce, when the list never ends. Sometimes I realize it has been days since I was intentional in loving my family. I go back to a 12 hour work shift and wonder how I’m already away from them again. Life is clearly not slowing down for me, so I have to believe one of the greatest acts of love I can show them is simply just to slow down for them. Kids want to sit at the table, they want to play the board game, they want to have ridiculously silly conversations with us. They want us to leave the dishes and wrestle or cuddle or read. Whatever it may be, let’s just do it.       4. For goodness sakes, lets put our phones down. Our kids want to see that we are watching them. Our spouses as well. We aren’t raising drones, so we need to be fully present in these ever fleeting moments. I’m convinced putting your phone down in somebody else’s company is one of my favorite ways to say I love you. It’s saying “in this moment, there is absolutely nothing more important than you.” Big statement for a little fella who just wanted you to see the picture he drew or how high he swung or how pretty her dress was. No Facebook update is more important than our spouses or our kids, I can promise you that.       5. Have the hard conversations about love and forgiveness. I love that I have situations in my life where I made big mistakes that I can use as a leading example for my kids. My heart is so stinkin quick to be mad when someone does me wrong, and it’s no coincidence my son and I have that in common. I think it’s human nature to hold a grudge, stay bitter or want revenge. We must teach them — by example — when they are little that forgiveness matters. I heard many times in my adult life that love is an endless act of forgiveness. We must practice what we preach daily and walk in the knowledge that if we want the generations to follow to not be bitter, angry, grudge-holding beings, we must as well show grace upon grace.
 Love around here lately looks nothing like Hallmark love. It’s not found on the top season of the bachelorette and its not even felt the most when the roses and chocolates come.
 Our love is found in the mundane. When I go to unload the dishwasher and it’s already empty, when he goes to do the laundry but it’s already done, when he’s the first to say I’m sorry. I can’t help but think if we practice this sacrificial love our children have a front row seat to just maybe they’ll practice it too.

He could extend his TV game show empire even farther.

“It would be too easy to focus on the nuts and bolts of the training for the protocol itself, but I think going to the Sheldon Church and the Penn Center, was incredibly rich, but the richness extends to the fact that you and this group acknowledge how important that historical context is,” McCammon said. “Everything we are doing now grew out of that history – the good and the bad and what we need to do today to make it better and better serve our patients.”

After a thrilling victory to punch their ticket to the Class 4A state tournament, the Waukee High School boys basketball team will be seeking a repeat performance in their state tournament opener.
   
 Set within the confines of Wells Fargo Arena, the Warriors (21-2) enter as Class 4A's fourth-seeded team preceded only by Iowa City West as the third seed, Cedar Falls as the second seed, and Ankeny Centennial as the top-seeded team in the bracket. For Waukee's first-round match-up, the will be battling the fifth-seeded North Scott Lancers (22-1).
   
 It will be a state tournament rematch as both these teams squared off in the consolation match-up from last season. This is a match-up that could very well be named the tournament battle as the only two times these squads have faced off in the past have been at the state tournament. Waukee ended up taking the most recent battle in last years' state consolation contest.
   
 The 2019-20 edition will feature a tale of two different styles of play. Waukee comes into the tournament averaging 71.7 points per game which ranks as the top mark in the Class 5A field. They will battle a North Scott team who ranks second in the field in top defense with the second-fewest points allowed across the Class 5A field (904 points). Teams have averaged just 39 points per contest against the Lancers. That presents an intriguing round-one match-up as one of the best Class 5A defenses against the top scoring offense in the bracket.
   
 Aside from the scoring totals, this battle seems pretty even on paper as Waukee's shooting efficiency slightly out-draws North Scott 53 percent to 49 percent. If you were looking for another edge in Waukee's favor, it would come in the rebounding category where the Warriors average 32 rebounds per contest compared to 25 for the Lancers.
   
 Defensively, Waukee will have to focus on North Scott senior Tytan Anderson. The senior averages 18.5 points per game on 57 percent shooting from the floor while also posting up a team-best 9.4 rebounds per game. The Warriors will answer with junior sharpshooter Tucker DeVries who enters averaging 21.8 points per game which ranks second among all Class 5A scorers. DeVries also averages a team-leading 4.9 assists per battle.
   
 The battle will take place on Tuesday, Mar. 10 as the Warriors and the Lancers will tangle at Wells Fargo Arena beginning at 6:30 p.m.

At the end of the day, however, there was a very clear winner amongst our array of weaponry, and it was the Super Soaker Sneak Attack 4-Way. It shot the farthest, had the most fun gimmick, had a respectable capacity, inflicted the most physical pain on our enemies/intern and was one of the cheapest at under US$10. It feels solid in your hands and is just the most fun gun out of all of the models we tested. And really, if a water gun isn't really fun to use, it's doing something wrong.
