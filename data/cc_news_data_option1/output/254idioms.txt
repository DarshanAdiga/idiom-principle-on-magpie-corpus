L'ungherese ha aiutato Shapovalov a perdere, per così dire, perché, al contrario del rivale, è sempre stato in grado di leggere la prima di "Shapo" e di entrare nello scambio, facendo faticare moltissimo il canadese. Eppure sembrava che in qualche modo Shapovalov potesse uscirne, perché verso la fine del secondo set, ha cominciato a tenere meglio il suo servizio e a fare qualche punto in più in risposta, fino a vincere un tiebreak complicatissimo, nonostante avesse sciupato un set point con il servizio. Ma nel terzo set, invece di accelerare, Shapovalov ha completamente perso la prima e Fucsovics ha potuto dilagare nonostante anche lui non fosse più impeccabile nei suoi turni di battuta.

Now, they are being celebrated as one of the better up and coming franchises in football. It merely goes to show how quickly things can and do change in football with health, good drafting and savvy executive work.

“What we have is a pause, not victory,” says veteran U.S. diplomat and former ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker. “For the next step, watch Iraq.”
 So let us watch. The 2003 invasion opened the door to Iranian influence there after the U.S. overthrew the Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein.
 Iran shares a 900-mile border with Iraq, in which a majority of Arabs are Shiite, as are most Persians.
 The George W. Bush administration naively believed that all Shiite Iraqis would welcome the U.S. with open arms because Saddam had oppressed them. But when I traveled to the holiest Shiite shrine city, Najaf in southern Iraq, in May 2003, religious leaders told me the Americans owed them big time. The first President Bush, they complained bitterly, had called for them to rise against Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War, then let Saddam slaughter them when they did so.

Soleimani helped Tehran cement control over key Shiite political parties and movements. After ISIS swept into northern Iraq in 2014, the Iranian general also shaped Shiite militias into a powerful fighting force against it. Tehran still hopes to subsume the regular Iraqi army under the control of Shiite militias that are loyal to Iran.
 After Soleimani’s death, pro-Iranian parties in parliament voted for the 5,000 or so remaining U.S. troops to leave. But it’s not at all clear that most Iraqis want them out.
 “The parliament’s decision was nonbinding,” I was told by phone from Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan, by Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq’s longest-serving foreign minister (2003-14) and a leader in its Kurdish region. “The current Iraqi caretaker government doesn’t have the legitimacy to take this decision.”
 Equally important, Kurdish and Sunni parties did not vote, nor are all Shia parliamentarians on board. “Any such move has to be done with a national consensus, which isn’t there,” said Zebari.
