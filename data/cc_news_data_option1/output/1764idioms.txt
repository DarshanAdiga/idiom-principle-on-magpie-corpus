Jim, I mean, some of it is a rebound from very little demand happening for a six week period. But I think it's, in part it's not necessarily new capacity coming on board. It's that of probably all of the economies that have gone through the coronavirus and COVID-19, China went into it earlier. China is certainly exhibiting at this point in time more of perhaps a V-shaped recovery in terms of the letters that everyone is talking about. It's probably, as Valentin said, total demand for some of the lower power kilowatt scale lasers has rebounded very strongly. We've seen also good demand from higher power pulsed lasers for EV, higher power lasers for welding, we referenced the AMB.

So far, there are encouraging signs coming from China, where consumers coming out of the running of the bulls appear to be going back to shopping. PwC estimates that in early April sales at non-food retailers were at 50% -80% of their pre-crisis levels. In luxury, the recovery has been even more extreme: A Hermes International flagship store raised $ 2.7 million when it reopened in Guangzhou in mid-April, believed to be a record daily gross for a boutique in China. , according to the WWD fashion trade bible. LVMH said that some of its major brands on the mainland had experienced a 50% increase in sales in April compared to the previous year.

We are dealing with another natural event. The suddenness and huge scale of COVID-19 makes solving the puzzle even more demanding for us all. Doing the right thing collectively and encouraging our medical and political leaders to do the same will help us buy time to put all the pieces together. COVID-19 is a medical challenge which will be controlled by understanding all of its parts. Vaccines and specific antiviral therapies are critical pieces to put in place. Until then we will all need to solve what we can and do what we can without the few pieces yet unidentified.

They continue with gross margin much less than reported even most of them, because government supports on this compensation. But we, without any compensation are providing similar with no big difference in price. By the way, from the point any European, any American can be competitors now. They are not able to compete it already, not only with our quality, but also prices for practical. China remained only competitor for IPG in this area. And they could not drop prices more essentially, because it would be hard for them and why is it so? They generate only more [Indecipherable] 35% gross margin, but it's artificial, not real margin, gross margin. So no more way to go down.

Of course, some of the consumer electronics stuff is exported, but there's also strong local demand there as well. So I think perhaps some of the supply chains that we serve are not just solely export-focused. They are also driven by internal China demand. I think over the medium term, clearly, the data points that we're going to be looking at are how regional and global PMIs trend? What export data looks like for robotic orders coming out of other Asian countries and machine tool data exports? So while we're pleased with the overall performance in Q1 with revenue coming at the top end of the range, I'm pleased to be able to guide at least sequentially higher. It's not as though we or the global economy is out of the woods yet. I think there remains some uncertainty on that, Jed.

YORK - Officials honored a local mechanic for offering a helping hand and a local business for donating N95 masks to first responders for last week's Community Recognition Awards.
   
 This week, the town honored community members for sewing protective masks, and a local man for spreading a positive message.
   
 Pierre Puffer was nominated last week for his work with The York Community Service Association for offering low-cost car repairs to those in need during the coronavirus closures.
   
 YCSA Executive Director Michelle Surdoval nominated Puffer, and said he was a great resource for her organization.
   
 "He is always there to lend a helping hand to someone who needs car repairs, quickly and with reasonable pricing," Surdoval said in an email.
   
 "He has done things throughout the year, but recently has been very helpful in some difficult cases. If we need help, he always says 'yes!'"
   
 Sig Sauer was nominated last week by York Village Fire Chief Chris Balentine for donating N95 masks to first responders.
   
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that N95 masks are critical supplies reserved for first responders and the most efficient face- masks available.
   
 This week, Mike Lee of Lee Tree Service was honored for creating a banner that now hangs over York Street and reads, "Thank you to our York heroes."
   
 "We did this as a gesture for those who are facing the real danger of working in this environment, Lee said.
   
 "This community has given me a place to call home and be a part of in many ways. It is also our company and family motto 'Do the right thing' and this seems like the right thing to do," Lee added.
   
 Additionally, local seamstresses were honored for creating cloth masks for front line responders, Sentry Hill workers and residents, town employees, York Housing Authority workers, and more.
   
 Many are part of the group Seacoast Mask-Makers, a grassroots organization that donates supplies and time to create cloth face masks for essential workers and vulnerable people.
   
 The awards are part of the Community Member Recognition program, an initiative started by the town to recognize extraordinary acts of service from businesses and York residents during the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 York Code Enforcement Officer Amber Harrison created the awards in conjunction with the York Region Chamber of Commerce and York Rotary Club.
   
 Harrison announced the two award recipients during Monday's Board of Selectmen meeting
   
 "It's a pleasure to be able to share some of the good things people are doing in our community," said Harrison.
   
 The town plans to announce a new award winner each Monday during the coronavirus shutdowns at Board of Selectmen meetings. Recipients receive certificates and will be honored at a reception party Dec. 5 before the Festival of Lights Parade, Harrison said.
