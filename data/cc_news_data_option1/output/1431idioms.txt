  _\"He who feed a hungry animal, feeds his own soul\" ~Charlie Chaplin_
 Even though our lives seem to have stopped as we shelter in place, the wild world is still tick tocking along. The weather has been so mild this winter that I've noticed many animals have migrated back or come out of hibernation early. Have you noticed? The problem with that, besides those freezing days that pop in once in a while, is that there isn't a lot of spring food ready yet.
 Many of the plants are just starting to poke through the ground. Finding food seems like it would be tough for the animals. On my walks, I would see frog eggs one day and the next they were gone. I'm sure some hungry raccoon enjoyed those eggs. Luckily, on warm days, I still hear many frogs singing for a mate.
 There are some cool things for nature watchers, though. Because the leaves are just starting to fill in, some bird nests are more visible. I have also seen some rabbit dens.
 Mother nature is finally catching up with the early cycling of animals clocks and more food is becoming available. So if you only feed the animals in winter (which is highly commendable), I would ask that you feed them for a couple more weeks to help them out.

This is one of those things that has been in Animal Crossing for a long while now, but it is still something that many of the newer folks jumping into the game don't know about.

It's a good way to expand the look of your island, and a great way to progress towards raising your island rating.

 Despite the fact that he is now known as one hell of a huge character thanks to the hit Netflix documentary series, Joe was quite a boring and placid camera behind it all according to Rick.

Lockdown Powers: It’s a Slippery Slope from Handwashing to House Arrest

The affecting manner of Yondu's death sent shockwaves across the fandom. Since the series takes place within the MCU, where Loki has made a party trick out of returning from the grave, fans badgered series helmer James Gunn on social media to pull a similar stunt to bring back Yondu.
 RELATED: James Gunn Will Join Tonight's Guardians of the Galaxy Online Watch Party
 Gunn has always been firm about keeping Yondu dead, maintaining that bringing him back would cheapen his sacrifice, and now it seems that Rooker is of the same opinion, even if it means no longer getting to be a part of the most successful film franchise in history. Still, just because the actor has shut the door on Yondu does not mean he is done with the MCU as a whole since he mentions a willingness to take on another role in the franchise.
 It would not be the first time an actor takes on two different Marvel roles. Paul Bettany served as the voice of Tony Stark's AI assistant JARVIS, before finding a second role as Vision. Josh Brolin played Thanos, but he was also Cable in _Deadpool 2_ , and since the Merc with the Mouth is now a part of Disney and the MCU, so is Cable.
 So the day may very well come when we see Michael Rooker in another role in the MCU, perhaps this time playing an earthling instead of a space pirate with a magic wand and a red, cybernetic mohawk. Although that character description alone makes any other possible role seem boring by comparison.

You can always count on the government to take advantage of a crisis, legitimate or manufactured. This coronavirus pandemic is no exception. Not only are the federal and state governments unraveling the constitutional fabric of the nation with lockdown mandates that are sending the economy into a tailspin and wreaking havoc with our liberties, but they are also rendering the citizenry fully dependent on the government for financial handouts, medical intervention, protection and sustenance. Unless we find some way to rein in the government’s power grabs, the fall out from this will be epic.

Ok since they are in short supply these days here are some facts… We were on tour in Western Europe for two weeks late Jan /early Feb..then up and down the southeast/eastern US playing arena shows mid Feb to early March. We played Charleston, SC on March 10 and they pulled the plug on our tour March 12 and I returned home. This photo was taken at 9am on March 13th when my wife took me to our local hospital ER due to chest pains, fever, and pre-stroke blood pressure levels. I spent an hour listening to a (highly condescending) Doctor refuse to test me because I “did not fit testing criteria” and tell me why it was impossible that I had contracted the virus due to its extreme rarity and that it was not in western Europe yet during that same period (which we now know is incorrect) even though I was told by two nurses that I was the first person their hospital had walk in requesting to be tested. Almost one month later on April 6th my wife and I were both tested after finally finding a free drive-thru testing facility outside a National Guard depot in Alabama. Yesterday on Friday April 10th, after almost one month without any symptoms, I received a call from the Nashville CDC stating that my test resulted in a positive detection for Covid-19. My wife (who has been by my side since Europe) tested negative. I should also add that the CDC nurse I spoke to yesterday told me that it reacts differently in a case by case basis and the White House briefings and the information they are providing is basically pure speculation causing fear and that the only thing anybody knows is that we don’t really know much yet. All I know is I first felt symptoms a month ago yet Im still positive and contagious and now on quarantine in the dojo until April 19th and really wishing Id taken my wife’s advice and put a bathroom in the floor plans..live and learn. But hey, at least our Government appointed task force headed by a man who does not believe in science is against mass testing and we now have a second task force in the works to “open America back up for business”!

Kathleen Fischer Probst      Indianapolis - Kathleen Fischer Probst, 95, Indianapolis, passed away on Friday, April 10. She was born in Glenwood, Minnesota on May 23, 1924 to William H. and Oline E. (Hegg) Fischer. Kathleen Fischer grew up in Glenwood, MN, located on Lake Minnewaska. From the age of 5, Kathleen was a girl who had a dream to become a professional figure skater. Although she never had a formal lesson, she worked hard, learned from other skaters, and made her dream come true by auditioning and being selected to join the prestigious Shipstads and Johnson Ice Follies based in Minneapolis, MN in 1944. She performed in principal cities all across the US from Seattle to Madison Square Gardens. Kathleen continued to skate throughout her life with the Indianapolis Winter Club until the age of 82.      After her skating career, Kathleen married Gerald W. Probst from Morris, MN who was a Navy veteran of WWII. They lived in Minneapolis while he completed his Ph.D.      in biochemistry at the University of Minnesota and then moved to Indianapolis where Dr. Probst began his career with Eli Lilly and Company. They celebrated 62 years of marriage on August 18, 2008. They are the parents of Gregory S. (Karen), Douglas E. (Lynda), Michael J. Probst, and Jennifer (John) Connor; nine grandchildren: Matthew and Kristen, Bradley (Erma), Suzanne and David, Kyle and Erik Probst, Katelyn and Grace Connor; and two great grandchildren Gabe and Jude Probst. Kathleen is predeceased by her husband Gerald W. Probst who passed      away on October 5, 2008.      Mrs. Probst was a devoted and loving wife and mother. She had a deep love for her family which was a great source of pride and joy to her. She was never happier than being surrounded by her family during the holidays, family dinners and get togethers. She enjoyed entertaining, always set a beautiful table and was a gracious hostess.      Mrs. Probst was also an accomplished oil and water color artist with her favorite subject matter being flowers, many from her own garden. She took art lessons for many years at the Broad Ripple Art Center. She also was a docent at the James Whitcomb Riley Home and a member of Alpha Theta Latreian.      Mrs. Probst was a member of St. Lawrence and Our Lady of Mt Carmel parishes. Hers was a life formed by faith and virtue and it showed in everything she did. Kathleen was as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside. She was a kind, caring and gracious person. She possessed a remarkable quality for cheerfulness, a sense of the positive and a gift of inner happiness which animated her spirit and endeared her to family, friends, and acquaintances alike. She was a beloved figure and was able to bring happiness to others simply by smiling and being happy herself. No words can adequately describe how much she will be missed, our dear beloved mother, grandmother, and great grandmother.      The family would like to express their sincere appreciation to the staff at both Wellbrooke of Westfield and Wellbrooke of Carmel for the care they provided Kathleen during her final years and also to the St. Francis Ministry at St. Maria Goretti Parish for their extraordinary prayers during this time.      Arrangements are being made by Leppert Mortuary and Crematory. A private ceremony is planned with interment at Our Lady of Peace Cemetery. A Celebration of Life is planned for a later time. To share a memory or condolence, please visit      www.LeppertMortuary.com. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Parish, the Broad Ripple Art Center or

NEW ORLEANS (AP) " The chickens on Will Mastin's farm Local Appetite Growers in Alabama aren't picky about what they eat. Right now, he's feeding them lots of lettuce, because the restaurants that normally order his salad greens aren't buying.
 As the country struggles to contain the coronavirus, restaurants across the country are closed due to stay-at-home orders. Those that remain open with takeout are often selling a fraction of what they did before the pandemic. The small farms across the South, which supply the region's best restaurants with fresh ingredients, now struggle to sell their fruits and vegetables.
 If the shutdown of restaurants continues into May, the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition estimates that small farmers across the U.S. could lose more than $19 million in sales.
 Local Appetite is a three and half acre farm in Baldwin County near the Gulf Coast. Lettuce is the speciality, which the farm grows year round in greenhouses, along with tomatoes, carrots, turnips and cucumbers.
 'It's small, but we farm it pretty intensively,' Mastin said.
 Normally, Local Appetite depends on high-end restaurants in Orange Beach, Fairhope and New Orleans for two third of its sales. With that business gone, Mastin is looking for new customers.
 The farm also offers a produce delivery service. Demand for that service has exploded, as people are cooking at home more during the coronavirus crisis.
 'It's crazy, because right as our restaurant orders started dropping off our home delivery service started picking up really, really fast,' he said. 'We've picked up more new customers in the last week than probably in the last four months.'
 Those new home customers, however, are not enough to make up for the lost sales to restaurants, Mastin said.
 Compostella Farm in Picayune, Miss., is also looking for new customers now that restaurants, which were 90 percent of its customers, aren't buying. The one acre farm, which also focuses on lettuces and greens, supports Madeline Yoste and her husband, Timothy Robb.
 'We're feeling okay. This happened at a relatively good time, having just gone through Mardi Gras and a busy tourist winter season,' Yoste said. 'We've got some funds on hand, and that makes us feel a little more relaxed and able to take our time in our decision making.'
 The farm normally sells a small amount of lettuce to grocery stores. With supermarkets now busier than before, they hope to sign up more as customers. They are also trying to sell more to home cooks who live near the farm.
 'The hardest thing is having to find new customers. It takes years to build up those relationships through word of mouth,' she said.
 It is easier for small farms to specialize in a few crops when their customers are restaurants, who buy in bulk. The shift to more home cooks as customers often means planting a larger variety of vegetables.
 If it can't sell its produce, Compostella Farm is donating the leftovers to restaurants, like the Donald Link's restaurants group in New Orleans, that are cooking free meals for their laid off staff.
 'We're trying not to freak out,' Yoste said.
 Covey Rise Farms, north of Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, relied on 100 area restaurants for 99% percent of its business. The 75 acre farm employs roughly 50 people. Now, it's trying to expand its direct sales to home cooks, offering bags of produce that can be picked up throughout the area.
 'The only thing that is kind of saving us right now is we're in between seasons,' said Austin Kirzner, marketing manager for Covey Rise. 'Moving forward, once we're in the peak of spring season, we're going to have a lot of vegetables that we've already planted.'
 As Covey Rise and other farms plant their spring crops, they have to guess what the world will be like 60 or 90 days from now when the vegetables will be ready to harvest. Will restaurants be open again?
 'We went to be there for the restaurants,' Kirzner said. 'When they're ready, we want to be ready.'
