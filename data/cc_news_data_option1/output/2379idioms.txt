The only non-retro game on this list, and also the only one that's _not_ just about dogfighting. But that's how well _Star Wars Battlefront II_ nails the Star Wars space combat experience. The Starfighter Assault mode pits two teams of 12 against one another in a variety of familiar deep space and near-orbit environments. It also fills the spaceways with a bunch of AI-controlled ships, both to make each battle feel bigger and to give you more things to explode. It's just one mode in a much larger game and the attack/defend objectives are very simple, but the overall fidelity of the experience and smoothness of the gameplay makes _Battlefront II_ 's Starfighter Assault a big winner, and one you can play on any modern machine.

“And that’s a good thing.”
 Then at 10:27 A.M. on “Re-Opening Day” after a dormant three months, Kendrick was in the lobby when he saw a woman navigating the entrance to become the first official visitor in the new world order.
 “I think we need some balloons,” he said.
 Alas, Kendrick had to hurry to a phone appointment before he could personally greet the appropriately masked Alexa Mathes, who was traveling from Brooklyn, New York, to Colorado with her husband — who was working Tuesday and unable to attend.
 Knowing they’d be spending the day here, she had researched online what she could do to get to know the city in that time and found herself drawn to the NLBM in large part for its role as a symbol and repository of civil rights.
 “I’m interested in learning more about the Black experience and the history of the Black experience and what that means in the context of today but also in the context of generations prior,” said Mathes, science editor for Newsela.
 Noting that people who are not of color have work to do on developing “empathy and appreciation” of that experience, she later added, “I think we want to be on the right side of history. And it seems like there’s a choice you can make now, and there’s a choice you can make in the future. And I’d like to make that choice now for the future.”
 The reinvigorated pursuit of police reforms and racial equality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd beneath the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin makes the reopening particularly relevant. But that’s not the only percolating current event that resonates with — or is it reverberates from? — the museum.

“Let Gone With the Wind be gone with the wind,” the 50-year-old hip-hop icon told the Associated Press.
 Latifah specifically takes umbrage with the treatment of Hattie McDaniel, who played Mammy, and ultimately became the first African-American to be nominated for and to win an Academy Award.
 The “Ladies First” rapper says, while historic, people need to be aware of McDaniel’s treatment during the coveted cinema ceremony that year.
 “They didn’t even let her in the theater until right before she got that award,” Latifah explained, pointing out that segregation prevented the groundbreaking actress from celebrating her history-making achievement.
 “Someone came outside and brought her into the auditorium. She wasn’t even allowed to sit in there… and then she had to read a speech that was written by a studio. You know that’s not what the hell she wanted to say.”
 Winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and making history didn’t change McDaniel’s life.
 “Then after that, all she could do was play the same kinds of roles,” the Oscar nominee maintained, adding that McDaniel’s racial struggles are similar to those faced by present-day black actors and actresses.
 "So the opportunities at that time and the way that those in power in that business were relegating us and marginalizing us and not allowing us to grow and thrive after that was just terrible," she concluded.

BRUSSELS — Europeans have lamented that the United States has relinquished its role as a global moral leader under President Donald Trump. But the proliferation of Black Lives Matter protests around the world has solidified belief here that American society remains a superpower of influence, even if its politicians do not.
 Protests have erupted in Australia, South Africa, Brazil. In war-wracked Syria, one artist painted a mural of George Floyd, the black man who died while being pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer, on a fragment of a wall in a bombed-out house.
 But nowhere outside America has the Black Lives Matter movement forced a more powerful reckoning than in Europe, where increasingly diverse societies have often done little to grapple with their colonial legacies and modern-day discrimination.
 In Rome, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Madrid, Lisbon and cities across Britain, protesters have taken to the streets to express solidarity with Americans but also to demand changes within their own countries.
 "When things come out of black America, we see them. Then there's an attempt at a boomerang throw," said Gary Younge, a sociology professor at the University of Manchester, who has written about his experience as a black Briton traveling the American South. "Everybody sees George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner. And there's a hope that if we throw that out there, and we highlight it, that it will come back and hit people on the head about the things that are going on here."
 There are signs that the European protesters' demands are gaining traction.
 Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his country's "Black Pete" blackface Christmas tradition needed to come to an end. The Belgian parliament approved a truth-and-reconciliation commission to reckon with a bloody colonial past. The spokesperson for French President Emmanuel Macron wrote an op-ed – presumably with Macron's knowledge and approval – saying her country should revisit its refusal to collect statistics on race.
 On Wednesday, the European Parliament held an introspective debate about racism, with at least one lawmaker wearing a "Black Lives Matter" T-shirt.
 "The diversity of our society is not represented" in the European Parliament or elsewhere in EU institutions, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, looking around the chamber.
 Just 24 of the 705 members of the European Parliament are people of color, according to an analysis by the European Network Against Racism. That's about 3%, compared to rough estimates that 10% of EU citizens are people of color.
 "The time has come for us to do more than just listen and condemn racism," von der Leyen said.
 Black and minority activists in Europe have been working for years to push for more equitable societies. But they have often gotten a dismissive reception from their nations' mostly-white leaders. This time, though, just as in the United States, Floyd's death appears to have forced an unusually broad-based reckoning.
 The power of the U.S. tumult to change European minds is a testament to the enduring power of American culture in the world, analysts said. It is difficult to imagine police brutality in France sparking protests in Germany, for instance.
 But the discussion about race and black lives in Europe may also have been made possible precisely because it originated elsewhere, Younge said.
 "America is taken notice of by white Europeans in a way that black Europeans aren't always. And so we leverage that in order to shine a light on the things that otherwise would be ignored," he said. European societies "still assume that they are white countries to which black people have come, and the black people are visitors have no right to influence the conversations."
 The American grievance with police killing black citizens echoes in Europe. Protesters have connected Floyd's death to police encounters in London, the suburbs of Paris and Dessau, Germany.
 But partly because European police kill many fewer people overall, the focus of protesters here is broader. They point to discrimination that denies black Europeans educational opportunities, housing and jobs. They decry their governments for, at least until now, failing to recognize that racism is even an issue within their countries.
 "Historically, there's always been this fiction that European states are ethnically-based national groups," said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. "So if there was an Algerian or a Turkish or a Pakistani immigrant, they were just immigrants, they weren't part of Europe. The police mistreatment of those minority communities was still seen as how the police are treating others, not how they treat our citizens."
 In Brussels, which is not only the capital of Belgium but also the de facto capital of the European Union, 10,000 protesters packed a central plaza earlier this month to demand recognition of discrimination by police, as well as the country's brutal colonial history in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 Belgium is often occupied by disagreements between its white French-speakers and white Dutch-speakers, with relatively little space for the concerns of Belgians who have other origins.
 "It's the first time since I was born, and I'm 35, that all worlds in Belgium are saying, 'OK, we're willing to listen to what black people have to say,'" said Donnay Musombo, a member of Change Asbl, which helped organize the Black Lives Matter protest in Brussels.
 She said protesters and members of the Congolese community had been talking about why they were finally being heard, after years of efforts.
 "We came to the conclusion that an African American is considered more than an African. An African American is valued more than an African," she said. "It took George Floyd to have Europe listening to us."
 As the result of the Belgian protests, cities and a university have removed a handful of statues of colonial king King Léopold II, whose conquest of Congo cost up to 10 million lives there. The education minister for French-language schools in Belgium said educators would require the teaching of Congolese history and Belgian colonialism in upcoming revisions to their curriculum. There is talk of King Philippe – the great-great-grandson of Léopold's young brother – issuing a formal apology for the Belgian rule of Congo. Even the king's aunt, Princess Esmeralda, called for it last week.
 And senior politicians have said a broader discussion about the past needs to take place in a society that still has not had a full reckoning.
 "It is time for Belgium to come to terms with its colonial past," Patrick Dewael, the president of the lower house of Belgian parliament, wrote on Twitter ahead of a decision in parliament on Wednesday to appoint a "truth and reconciliation commission" to address colonial abuses.
 This is, of course, hardly the first time protests in one country led to upheaval in another. The Arab Spring revolutions of 2011 started with the death of a Tunisian fruit vendor. America's #MeToo movement spread like wildfire around the world. And the African American struggle for civil rights has had a global resonance for decades, no matter the ups and downs of power in official Washington.
 "There's this interest in the civil rights movement and the status of African Americans that's independent of the U.S. government," said Kevin Gaines, a professor of Civil Rights and Social Justice at the University of Virginia, who has written about the links between newly independent African nations and African American civil rights activists in the 1950s and 1960s.
 The horrific video of Floyd's death speaks across nations, Gaines said.
 "It almost crystallizes 400 years of anti-black oppression," he said. "You struggle to find the words to describe what's before us. It just shows a kind of primal scene that provides an insight into the nature of anti-black oppression cross the ages."

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — More than 86,000 Floridians applied for new jobless benefits last week, a drop of almost 30% from the previous week, as pandemic-related restrictions continued easing up across the state, according to labor figures released Thursday. But the easing of restrictions meant to stop the spread of the new coronavirus has accompanied new outbreaks around Florida, forcing some local leaders to pull back. In the Florida Keys, Monroe County commissioners voted Thursday to make facial coverings mandatory, effective immediately. All employees and customers in businesses and other public places where there is a roof overhead must now wear face coverings over their nose and mouth, according to the new ordinance. Patrons in restaurants and bars are permitted to remove their masks to eat and drink. Commissioners also recommended that anyone age 6 and older should carry a mask when they leave home and wear it “whenever they come within six feet of another person.” Violation of the mask requirement is punishable by fines, but not jail time, the commission said in a news release. The Florida Keys reopened to visitors at the beginning of the month after being closed to nonresidents starting in mid-March in order to stop the virus's spread. Further north, in Broward County, a Jewish community center closed its preschool camp after two staff members tested positive for COVID-19.

The consensus in financial markets is that it will launch another bond-buying program of at least another 100 billion pounds ($127 billion), to complement the 200 billion stimulus it announced in March when the outbreak was in its ascendancy.

_Milano, 18 giu 16:15 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- È stato ripristinato il treno 5202 (in partenza da Molteno alle 7,23) sulla linea Lecco-Como. Lo ha confermato intervenendo alla Commissione Territorio e Infrastrutture (presieduta dalla Consigliera Claudia Carzeri di Forza Italia) l’assessore alle Infrastrutture, Trasporti e Mobilità sostenibile Claudia Terzi (Lega) rispondendo a un’interrogazione presentata dal Consigliere Raffaele Straniero. Il documento dell’esponente PD di Palazzo Pirelli, sottolineava una forte criticità su questa linea ferroviaria, che in seguito all’entrata in vigore del nuovo orario delle linee ferroviarie regionali, ha visto l’abolizione di 13 corse su 23 e chiedeva la riattivazione, in particolare, delle due corse del mattino in partenza da Molteno (5202) e da Lecco (5204). “Dopo le segnalazioni del Comitato pendolari e dei Consiglieri del territorio – ha dichiarato Terzi – abbiamo chiesto a Trenord di ripristinare entrambe le corse, ottenendo la riattivazione (a partire dal 15 giugno) della 5202 (con partenza da Molteno e arrivo a Como alle 8.00 circa) e la conseguente di ritorno, la 5205, con partenza da Como-San Giovanni e arrivo a Lecco alle 9.03. Non sarà invece possibile – ha spiegato l’esponente della giunta Fontana – coprire il “buco” che va dalle 9.30 alle 12.30, non per volontà di Trenord, ma perché queste tre ore vengono riservate da RFI per interventi sulle linee”. Terzi infine ha ricordato anche che i due treni in questione, il 5202 e 5204, utilizzati prevalentemente da studenti, “nei periodi in cui sono chiuse le scuole, portano un massimo di 30/50 passeggeri per treno. Nonostante ciò – ha ribadito – viste le richieste del territorio, ci siamo subito attivati per ottenere un risultato”. Parzialmente soddisfatto il Consigliere Straniero, che ha ringraziato l’Assessore per l’impegno dimostrato nei confronti delle esigenze del territorio e per la risposta esaustiva. “Mi auguro – ha aggiunto l’esponente dem - che la rimodulazione degli orari Trenord prosegua solo il tempo dell’emergenza Covid-19, perché nel medio-lungo periodo penalizzerebbe troppo la linea, impedendone un effettivo utilizzo da parte dei cittadini”.
