Hurts described his return to Alabama as “hectic in a good way.” The much- beloved quarterback is the biggest attraction on a star-studded South Team roster and stated he’s appreciating the love he’s received in Mobile.
 “The other day, I got on the elevator and a lady just started screaming ‘Jalen Hurts is really on my elevator!’” Hurts said with a grin. “Stuff like that. That’s special to me, and I know it won’t be like that forever. I’m just soaking it all in.”
 His three former Alabama teammates in attendance — Mayden, Lewis and Anfernee Jennings — have met him with a similarly warm greeting, sans the screaming.
 “As soon as Jalen got here we kind of connected, linked up,” Lewis said. “We just caught up, and we’ve been walking around chilling with each other ever since he got here… You’d think we’d hadn’t been separated for a year. So it’s fun catching up with him and just being back with him on a daily basis like good ole times.”
 Hurts and the South Team suited up for their first practice Tuesday as they prepare for Saturday’s Senior Bowl at 1:30 p.m. CT inside Ladd–Peebles Stadium. For what it’s worth, he wore an Oklahoma helmet. Although that matters not for his Bama brothers who are just happy for the opportunity to share a sideline with him one last time.
 “It means the world,” Jennings said. “What Jalen did for us and how he handled the situation, at the end of the day he’s always going to be my brother. So we’re going to take the field with him and you know we’re going to try and get a dub.”

"Last year, we were glad to be there, but we were also very disappointed that we weren't playing in THE game. It's going to be a very different experience this year," he said. "We've got that checked off but at the end of the day, we've still got a big goal to accomplish. At the beginning of the season, I talked to players about our goals during the year. Making the playoffs is goal number one. Bringing this (AFC championship) trophy home to Kansas City is goal number two. We've got those done. Our big goal left is to bring another Lombardi trophy back to Kansas City."

He did not return the rest of the quarter, as the Celtics turned a six-point deficit into a three-point lead. They built on it in the second, when Tatum scored 13 points and Kanter had 12 to give Boston a 69-55 lead at the break.

There had been close calls over the years. The teams of Marty Schottenheimer throughout the 1990s were always on the cusp of greatness, and Dick Vermeil kept the winning tradition in Kansas City. But when Andy Reid took the Chiefs to the AFC title game last year, and ultimately lost to the Patriots in overtime thanks partly to a coin flip and an offside penalty, Hunt and his family could be forgiven for thinking they were just a little bit jinxed.

Now you know how to break your fast, but what if you don’t want to end your fast just yet? When you’re first starting IF, or if you’re trying to graduate to a longer fasting window, there are certain things that can help get you over the hangry hump without sabotaging your results. (Of course, you should _always_ end a fast early if you’re feeling lethargic and can’t perform your normal day-to-day activities).
 Non-caloric (or very low-calorie) options that are widely accepted among intermittent fasting experts include seltzer water, coffee, and tea. Miller likes Earl Grey tea in particular, as it contains bergamot extract, which can help suppress appetite. “Just be sure not to add stevia or non-caloric sweeteners, which may provoke an insulin response,” she says.
 If you need something a bit more substantial to hold you over, or if you have a low body fat percentage (in which case, strict forms of fasting may not be wise, as they could throw your hormones out of whack), then sipping on a high quality bone broth, or coffee or tea blended with coconut or MCT oil, during your fasting window are both great options.
 “You can essentially ‘fool’ your body into thinking it is still fasting by having a fat like MCT or coconut oil, because they don’t bump up your blood glucose regulating hormone, insulin,” says Pedre. “This works great to curb your appetite during prolonged fasting hours.” And while this may not preserve _all_ of fasting’s benefits (for example, autophagy may be downregulated a bit), it seems to be beneficial for things like weight loss.

With the acquisition, Hansen said that Premier will continue to be located in their current home of Tualatin, Oregon — about 20 miles outside of Portland. Premier’s products will also continue to be sold under their already well- established brand as their sales, operations, and management will work closely with Minimizer to develop an overall strategy for company growth and expansion for both brands.
 “They have a lot of solid connections with truck fleets nationally, as well as strong ones in Mexico and South America,” Hansen said. “There are all areas where Minimizer sees a lot of opportunity to expand into.”
 Hansen stated that there is still some logistics in the works, including whether or not Minimizer will consider taking in some of Premier’s inventory and shipping from their Minnesota location. He explained that there will be upcoming strategy sessions to discuss all the potential possibilities.
 The new acquisition will not impact Minimizer’s move to Owatonna, Hansen promised. Before the snow fell, Hansen said that most all of the groundwork at their new location in Owatonna’s industrial park is finished minus the pouring of concrete. Their estimated move-in date remains spring 2021.

For Irvin Hines, visits from his kids can be stressful.
 The father of three kids ages 5, 14 and 21, Hines is currently in custody at Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland. He described the thin mat he and his young son had to sit on in a corner of the facility’s cafeteria and how the hard edges of the tables seemed designed for high-energy kids to bang their heads into.
 He said that mothers aren’t eager to take their children to see a parent behind bars and are often agitated by regulations over what they can wear during visits. Hines said that the uninviting environment makes it more difficult for parents to maintain a connection with their children while incarcerated.

The play is set in the office of Janine Bosko (Francesca Christian), an elite university history professor, where she is meeting with student, Zoe Reed (Jacqui Calloway). They begin to discuss a paper Zoe has written for class on the American Revolution. At first Bosko's criticisms are correcting grammatical errors, but moves into a deeper exchange about the thesis of the assignment. Reed is an overachieving student, being one of the few black undergraduates on campus she feels strongly that representation matters. She's no shrinking violet content to sit in class and get her grade, her thesis challenges Bosko's perception and the discussion becomes a power struggle between the truth and the status quo. The central theme is the type of mythical history we have all been spoon fed from our earliest years, namely that Washington and Jefforson created the United States Of America from dust or that it was built on the backs of slavery at a devistating human cost. Zoe's thesis maintains that the American Revolution didn't devolve into a radical revolution, like in France, because the working class was held in bondage. Bosko reels at the very idea that her heroes were flawed and refuses to acknowledge Zoe's argument. Eventually a recording of some of the professors more racist comments is made public and the fallout is poignant. The two characters locked in conflict carry the play through a deep discussion of systemic racism and the failure of academia to evolve into something that represents everyone.
