Minatta took two online classes at Santa Rosa Junior College last semester and next semester will attend one class on campus. He originally majored in business administration, but has now narrowed his choice down to accounting. “I want to be in a field I can do from my chair,” he said, “And I’ve always been a numbers guy.”


  One of the things he misses most is not being able to drive. He’s been researching adapted pickup trucks, but that could be a ways down the road. Such a vehicle, which he could drive with his hands and has a lift to help him get in and out are prohibitively expensive, and his mother is not quite sure that he’s ready yet.


  Wearing a cap with the words Live Lucky and a four leaf clover, Minatta said, “I feel solid, I have no regrets whatsoever. Bad days are rare and they make me appreciate the good ones.” Looking at her son and the genuine smile on his face, Ally said, “He’s made it possible for my husband and I to get through this.”


  Once in a while, when he is in the shower, he lets himself feel bad about what’s happened. “It’s easy to cry in the shower because you can’t tell how many tears there are,” he said. “There are bad days for sure, but they don’t come that often. Family and friends don’t let that happen. I’ve got to keep my spirits up. That’s the only thing I can do.”


  Minatta stops to think for a minute about where he sees himself five years from now.


  He hopes to have a job and be living on his own. “And if a missus finds her way into my life that would be dope.” He and his former girlfriend, who was with him at the time of his accident, have drifted apart and she is now living in southern California. But they keep in touch and are still friends.


  “I’d love to be walking in five years, but will that happen? Probably not in five years,” he said, but he believes it will happen eventually. “There are a lot of unknowns.”


  “I’ve learned to live with it for now, but I don’t want to have to live with it forever,” he said about his disabilities. He is optimistic that whether through stem cell research or robotics or medical advances he doesn’t even know about now, his physical life will continue to improve.


  “I think someday there will be a cure.”

BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP -- One week after a local youth football coach took the life of his longtime girlfriend and then his own, the community has rallied around those who have lost their loved ones.
   
 On Jan. 2, the bodies of Kris Corry, 30, and Tianna Drummond, 28, were found dead inside their Salem Road apartment in the Willow Pointe apartment complex.
   
 The Burlington Prosecutor's Office Monday ruled the deaths a murder-suicide. Investigators determined Corry had beat Drummond to death before shooting himself in the head.
   
 A GoFundMe fundraiser, titled "Long Live Tianna," was started to help the family of Drummond cover the cost of her funeral services.
   
 "She was a beautiful person and we want to celebrate her life," Yolanda Coffey said. "When these tragic things happen at a young age, people don't think about life insurance. We want to memorialize her in the right way."
   
 Coffey has been best friends with Drummond since they were in the second grade. The loss has left her devastated.
   
 "She was the life of the party. So outgoing and always down to have a good time and go on adventures," Coffey said. "She was an awesome mom, she always had kids with her, and was always on the sidelines."
      
 Drummond loved the beach, shopping, food, traveling and her family and friends. She was also an athlete who was the varsity captain of the field hockey team at Burlington City High School and graduated from Full Sail University in 2016 with a BA in Entertainment Management.
   
 She was a fiercely loyal friend.
   
 "She was very opinionated, always telling you if you were doing something wrong. She was someone you could go to for guidance," Coffey said.
   
 Coffey and the other GoFundMe organizer, Karena Chavis, said they were hoping to raise $10,000 by Sunday.
   
 Funeral services for Drummond are planned for Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Alpha Baptist Church in Willingboro.
   
 "We don't want to remember how she left us, we want to remember her life and legacy, remember how she lived," Coffey said. "We're trying to make sense of all this, but we know we never will. It's all about unity right now and uplifting these children. Not about tragedy, but remembering that these kids lost two parents that they adored."
   
 The couple leave behind two young sons, Julian and Kristopher Jr.
   
 Just over $6,500 was raised by late Friday afternoon.
   
 A fundraiser for the couple's two young children was also held at the Holiday Skating Center on Thursday, with all proceeds going to the boys. Other fundraisers have also been started to help the children and the families.
   
 Corry's funeral was set for Saturday at Tabernacle Baptist Church in Burlington Township.
   
 A friend of both Corry and Drummond since they attended Burlington City High School remembered both individuals as being kind-hearted and cheerful.
   
 "He (Kris) was always a kind-hearted guy, always upbeat, always cheerful," Rashad Perry said. "She was the same. Very outgoing, a very bubbly personality, cheerful -- always cracking jokes."
   
 Perry said his body went numb when he learned of the news of the couple's deaths.
   
 "My initial reaction was immediate and absolute shock and disbelief," Perry said. "I was in utter shock."
   
 Shock and confusion still seem to grasp many in the Burlington community in the days following the tragedy. Social media posts in the wake of the tragic events expressed disbelief that such a thing could happen, especially involving the couple. The Burlington City School District provided help to both students and members of the community who were struggling with the events.
   
 Perry, a Mount Holly resident, was still struggling.
   
 "I'm completely against domestic violence in any form or fashion, and in the same breath this is a person who I know has done great things, whose always been a leader and great guy in this area whose now done something like this," said Perry.
   
 In audio from the initial 911 call made to police to complain about the noise that had been coming out of the couple's apartment, a woman who said she lived below Drummond and Corry said they had been fighting and screaming through the night and into the morning. When asked by an operator if she thought Drummond had been hit, the neighbor said, "Yes, I think so."
   
 "When you've spent a lot of time around somebody, and they show you one side (of themselves) and that's the only side that you know, and then you hear about another side -- you never see it for yourself -- but you hear about it, and the proof is in the pudding because of the aftermath, my Lord. It's a lot to deal with," Perry said.
   
 Perry, who hosts the "4 tha Culture" podcast, is hoping he can also help the two children Drummond and Corry left behind. On Jan. 24, he will hold a second 4 tha Culture artist showcase, featuring a live 4 tha Culture podcast as well as live performances from local artists.
   
 Perry said he plans to donate part of the proceeds the children. He also hopes to use his platform to raise more awareness of mental health and domestic violence issues.
   
 "The only thing I can think about in the midst of all this is the two boys, because they now have no father or mother, and for me that's where I want to help the most," Perry said.
   
 The Second Official 4 tha Culture Artist Showcase will take place on Friday, Jan. 24 at Union Fire House in Mount Holly. Doors open at 8 p.m. and advance tickets are $10.

It was an extremely complicated time for Wilson, who tried to keep the country out of this war. The horrific losses seen by the British, French and Germans were well publicized in American papers, and many citizens did not want their sons, friends and neighbors to be killed in what was thought of as a European dispute. Before he was reelected by an extremely close margin in November of 1916, Wilson campaigned on the promise that he kept “Our boys out of this war.” But behind closed doors, it was a different situation. Since the days of George Washington the U.S. economy was built on trade that always saw American ships traveling to Europe. Germany had most of its own ports blockaded by the strength of the British navy, and this warring government did not believe America was neutral through our business dealings with the Allies.

About 40 special needs clients served by the nonprofit work as part-time employees, either at the concession stand on SMART trains, in the cafe at Kaiser Permanente on Mercury Way, or shredding documents for 92 Sonoma County businesses.


  Destroying papers is one of the most sought-after positions, Vaetoe said. About half of the clients enrolled in the social enterprise program do shredding work, and adding 52 new service locations under the county contract has provided a sense of legitimacy that can grow the operation at every level, she said.


  “It caters to everybody (on the autism spectrum), and it really allows for individuals acclimating themselves to social expectations in the workplace,” Vaetoe said. “It gives them a path to work towards. It gives them an opportunity to work in a structured environment where they know what’s expected of them.”


  The county contract, which runs through Nov. 30 with an option to extend for a year, is valued at more than $42,000.


  At the end of Corporate Center Court in southwest Santa Rosa Friday morning, several shredders shuffled through document storage boxes and tossed them into gray trash bins with precision.


  Once the bins filled up, Jay Jay Rico, director of social enterprise for Becoming Independent, rolled them toward the truck where a claw grasped and carried the bins on a conveyor built until they were turned level and emptied inside.


  More than 50% of adults with disabilities are unemployed despite a strong desire to contribute to the workforce, Rico said.


  The mobile truck will allow the shredding service to expand, bringing more clients into the program, he said. As the nonprofit becomes more self- sufficient, so do the clients who gain more independence each day on the job.


  “We have to be innovative and raise our own funds and not be so reliant on the federal government to allow us to provide the best services possible,” Rico said. “That’s what it all comes down to at the end of the day.”


  Anyone interested in the service can visit becomingindependent.org/shred for more information, or call 707-524-6644.

_Roma, 11 gen 16:04 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- La Regione Lazio con una nota annuncia che con un decreto del Commissario ad acta ha approvato il documento di indirizzo per lo Screening Oftalmologico Neonatale Universale ed ha individuato la Rete regionale dei Servizi. La finalità del programma di screening è quella di favorire l'identificazione precoce e la presa in carico dei neonati con alterazioni congenite dell'apparato visivo con particolare riferimento alla cataratta congenita. "I difetti oculari congeniti oltre a determinare un danno specifico alla funzione visiva – spiega nella nota l'Assessore alla Sanità e l'Integrazione Sociosanitaria della Regione Lazio, Alessio D'Amato - influenzano negativamente lo sviluppo delle capacità e dei normali percorsi di apprendimento del bambino. Una diagnosi precoce aiuta a migliorare i processi di cura e attraverso lo Screening Oftalmologico Neonatale, come suggerito dall'Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità (OMS), possiamo riconoscere patologie che potenzialmente possono mettere in pericolo la visione e, in alcuni casi, la vita". Nello specifico nei Punti Nascita del Lazio, riferisce anche la nota della Regione, verrà garantito a tutti, in maniera uniforme ed omogenea, i neonati l'esecuzione di un test di screening oftalmologico ospedaliero (test primo livello) prima della dimissione, in caso di positività al test del riflesso rosso, confermata da uno specialista oculista, verrà garantita entro le prime 4 settimane di vita, una valutazione oculistica (test secondo livello) presso un Centro di secondo livello per la conferma diagnostica e la presa in carico dei bambini a rischio di ipovisione e cecità".

Ever since his C6 vertebrae shattered in a snowboarding accident two years ago, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down, Dario Minatta, 24, has never let go of the hope that he will walk again.


  Sonoma oral surgeon Tyler Boynton just gave him a new reason to believe that someday there may be a cure for his spinal cord injury.


  When Boynton removed Minatta’s wisdom teeth this past fall he sent them to a lab in Kansas City where the stem cells in the tooth pulp were removed and stored for potential curative use in the future.


  “Now we wait for technology to figure it out,” Minatta said.


  It probably won’t be soon, and maybe not ever, but medical science is advancing quickly in its research to regenerate injured tissue, bones, muscles and nerves using stem cells. Healthy wisdom teeth of people under 30 contain abundant stem cells, making them perfect for banking.


  Boynton had never sent wisdom teeth to a stem cell storage lab before treating Minatta, and would never remove teeth just for that purpose. But after he had a pre-surgery consultation with Minatta, before necessary wisdom teeth removal that had already been recommended, he did some research and decided Minatta and his parents, Dino and Ally Minatta, may want to consider storing the teeth through Stemodontics. They decided to go for it.


  “I have taken out thousands of wisdom teeth and usually just throw them in the biohazard bin,” Boynton said. This time he put Minatta’s in a special transport cold pack and overnighted them to the FDA-approved lab. He said tooth banking labs have been around for several years, but Stemodontics is different. “They extract the pulp from the wisdom teeth, then the stem cells from the pulp, and grow the stem cells to make a larger number. The purpose is to have more,” he said. “And they assure that the stem cells are viable before freezing them.”


  The Minattas were unaware of this technology prior to Boynton’s recommendation, and the surgeon had a special emotional pull in his desire to help.


  When Boynton, 38, was a sophomore at Trinity College in Connecticut, he broke his neck. He was spending a semester abroad studying in Australia and while “roughhousing around” with some friends he fell backward and hit a tree, breaking his C2 vertebra. “I was lucky that there were no neurological deficits.” He was “millimeters away” from permanent spinal cord injury and the experience changed the course of his life.


  After time in the hospital in Australia and months wearing a neck brace, Boynton was still in serious pain a year later and had back surgery to freeze his C2 to his C1 vertebrae, curing him with the exception of very limited range-of-motion loss in his neck. “My injury made me want to totally change my career path. I went from being interested in finance and an MBA to wanting to do health care.”


  Boynton transferred to the University of Connecticut and became a pre-med major, beginning nine years of medical training. “I wanted to do something important with my life to help other people,” he said. He decided to be an oral surgeon after witnessing a six-hour surgery during med school, watching a tumor being removed from a patient’s jaw.

In the wake of the recent City Council election debacle, Ocala officials now plan to revamp election qualifications.


   


  This, of course, is a good idea. As we see it, there awaits an easy fix and a hard one. The issue is whether the city wants to help only itself, with no guarantee such a situation won't arise again, or work on reform that could benefit all of Florida.


   


  The council is tackling reform after Tyrone Oliver was elected in November, but then refused his seat after a 1986 felony drug conviction came to light.


   


  Florida's Constitution barred felons from voting and holding office until the state restored their rights. That changed a bit in November 2018, when voters approved Amendment 4 that automatically restored voting rights for felons who complete their sentences. Lawmakers conditioned that further last spring by mandating fully paying court-imposed fees, when applicable, as part of the sentence-fulfilling requirement.


   


  Oliver apparently paid his debt to society and had twice sought restoration of his rights since 2012. He has yet to win approval. It's unclear why because such cases are confidential.


   


  Oliver seemed to believe Amendment 4 permitted him to serve. Additionally, no one -- except Oliver himself -- was obligated to verify whether his record was clean.


   


  Yet faced with the circumstances of his past and the existing law, the council voted to not seat him. The city is now planning a special election for that seat.


   


  Currently, the city charter imposes two requirements to serve on the council: candidates must be Ocala residents for at least a year and qualified voters.


   


  But candidates also must file a residency affidavit affirming that "he or she is qualified under the Constitution and the laws of Florida ... to hold the office of city councilman."


   


  Such language would, and should, prohibit convicted felons from running. But that only works if felons-turned candidates understand the Constitution to begin with -- and as Oliver showed, Amendment 4 has muddied the water.


   


  We have a couple of suggestions.


   


  The easiest change would be to spell out specifically in the charter that a felony conviction disqualifies someone as a candidate, while that's state law. The city also could require candidates to submit to a background check, conducted by the city clerk's office at the candidates' expense.


   


  Those are the easy steps.


   


  The more difficult way to bulletproof this situation would be for state lawmakers to fix the law so former felons, except those barred from voting under Amendment 4, could hold public office -- though that may require another constitutional amendment.


   


  Ocala could help the entire state by lobbying lawmakers to make such a change.


   


  Oliver's situation is unfortunate because he has rehabilitated his life, and seems committed to the civic good. He is more a victim of the state's previous foot-dragging on rights restoration than anything else.


   


  But the City Council could salvage his case, and make an important statement on criminal justice reform, by ensuring those like Oliver who transform their lives and want to repay society through public service can do so.

Walmart shaming and other lies


   


  It's possible that Douglas MacKinnon of The Baltimore Sun is simply spouting off in ignorance in his editorial "Walmart shaming shows country's class divide" (Sunday, Dec. 29), but it's more likely that his editorial is just another example of blaming conservatives for what liberals do. After all, that is a tenet of Saul Alinsky.


   


  The shaming of Walmart shoppers comes from the left, and it stems from their hatred of founders/CEOs of big corporations in general and Sam Walton in particular. This started back in the Obama days when the left started criticizing success, and it continues today with all the Democratic candidates for president.


   


  Another example of this blaming the other side for liberal actions is the rise in anti-Semitism being blamed on the right. The Democratic Party has always had anti-Semitic tendencies going back to Southern Democrats' involvement in the Ku Klux Klan.


   


  Today we have Democrats in Congress who espouse openly anti-Jewish rhetoric and who stopped the passage of a resolution against antisemitism until anti- Islamism was added. This, too, started with Obama. When he did his apology tour to the Arab countries in the Middle East but couldn't find time to go to Israel, he gave the nod to the anti-Semites and anti-Israel liberals that it was now OK to express their prejudice openly.

  Trump's self-interests


   


  In response to the Dec. 29 letter "Terrorists," 15 of 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Saudi's crown prince sanctioned the execution of Khashoggi. Yemen is a catastrophe. Many human rights abuses continue.


   


  Trump blocks or circumvents congressional censure. Trump has made clear that human rights and even murder will be overlooked if dictators have money to spare. Commercial deals take precedence over human rights, justice and democracy.


   


  Trump's travel ban is based on fear-mongering. It emboldens bigots in the U.S. and stokes anti-American sentiment abroad.


   


  Chances of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack by a refugee are about 1 in 3.86 billion per year. The annual chance of being murdered in an attack by an illegal immigrant is zero. Foreign-born terrorism is a manageable threat given the huge economic benefits of immigration and the relatively smaller costs of terrorism (Cato Institute).


   


  Studies find that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native- born Americans. Other studies find that crime rates are lowest in states with the highest immigration growth rates, that states with larger numbers of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates.


   


  Our Founding Fathers had the foresight to create a Congress with the duty to perform oversight of the executive branch. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress's power to investigate is "coextensive with the power to legislate."


   


  Yes, America, we must wake up to how we must protect our democracy against the blatant manipulation of facts, gas-lighting, etc., that serve Trump's self-interests.

  Be like Princess Diana


   


  Homelessness in our country has been very much in the news lately.


   


  I thought of the homeless especially upon reading some quotes by Princess Diana:


   


  "Everyone needs to be valued. Everyone has the potential to give something back."


   


  "Anywhere I see suffering, that is where I want to be doing what I can."


   


  "Every one of us needs to show how much we care for each other and in the process we care for ourselves."


   


  "Carry out a random act of kindness with no expectations of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you."


   


  "I think that the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved."


   


  "Nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people. It is a good and essential part of my life, a kind of destiny."


   


  If Princess Diana were alive today, she probably would be trying to work out the homeless problem all over the world. So maybe her quotes will inspire others to do the same.

Done an Ironman? Run with the bulls in Pamplona? How does six minutes of combat sound?


  "You can't take part in a contest after just a few months of training. We don't want anything to do with it," is Smith's final word on the matter.


  But white-collar boxers have no intention of going professional. They can earn a lot more trading pork bellies and cornering the market for frozen orange juice. They keep in shape and they take their training seriously, but basically they just want to lace on some gloves and hit somebody for fun. Is that so wrong?


  "We don't recommend it," says Keith Walters, the chairman of the Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABAE).


  "It's a physical sport: you've got to be looked after. To be honest, it's not a sport I'd recommend to everybody.


  "[White-collar boxing] is obviously a money-making thing."


  Walters points out that the ABAE has listened to the market by raising the upper age-limit for amateur boxers from 34 to 40 with its new Masters division. __That would still be too low, though, for Keen and at least one other fighter on the "Brawl in the Hall" card.


  "With the pros and us, we've got a good structure. So this unlicensed fighting worries me a bit," adds Walters.


  It almost goes without saying that the BBBC and the ABAE ban any of their coaches, fighters or officials from participating in white-collar events.


  "The board of control hate it - hate it with a vengeance," says ring announcer Steve Holdsworth, __who has been involved with the sport as a fighter, journalist and commentator for 40 years.


  "I used to hold every licence you could possibly hold, but then the BBBC found out I was involved in a show like this and told me I couldn't do both. I said you can keep your licence.


  "This scene is getting huge. I do half a dozen shows a month. When I was a BBBC licence-holder as an MC I did two shows in three years.


  "The BBBC is very worried about this and rightly so. So are the amateurs.


  "They've brought in Masters boxing because of this, but these guys don't want to do that. They want to have a bit of a laugh, and it's all for a great cause."


  For most of the night in Bethnal Green it is hard to argue with Holdsworth's upbeat assessment, particularly as most of the boxers are raising money for their own causes, and £5 from every ticket is going to the promoter's designated charity, William's Fund. __


  Safety is clearly taken seriously too - though participants must sign a personal injury waiver. The fighters are wearing 16oz gloves (the well-padded gloves the pros use for sparring) and head guards. They are not divided into weight categories, but Toff has used his experience to avoid mismatches, and there is an experienced referee in the middle, a doctor at ringside and an ambulance outside.


  Sharp wins his bout against the more experienced Roberts, and is soon enjoying his friends' praise in the bar, which is doing a lively trade.


  And then Des "Boom Boom" O'Connor is knocked out by financial adviser Guy "Old Man" Bolam. O'Connor is up again pretty quickly but the referee has already stopped the fight.

CAZADERO — For years, Cazadero construction worker and military veteran Joe Meisch has been donating his patented temple massager device to other vets suffering headaches and migraines caused by conditions such as PTSD.


  Since 2006, he’s given veteran clinics and organizations about 3,500 of the devices, which sell for $66 apiece. But Meisch, an Army Reserve and National Guard veteran, could be on the verge of turning goodwill into substantial profit — and finally the breakthrough he’s worked thousands of hours to achieve.


  Last year, he became a vendor for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and his sales jumped to about $48,000 — a leap from $2,800 in 2018 sales, he said. This year after a boost from a $50,000 federal Small Business Innovation Research grant, Meisch aims to land a sole source contract with the Air Force. That could increase his sales tenfold or more, he said.


  “It could lead to thousands sold to the Air Force and other military branches,” he said recently, standing in the workshop of his Cazadero home where he assembles his massaging device.


  Meisch, who jokingly calls his home the “Cazadero Neuroscience Institute,” has been plugging away at his invention for nearly two decades. During that time, he tried to get the device in the hands of as many military veterans as he can. He’s made connections with local clinics and organizations who treat veterans for migraines, stress, anxiety and other combat-related issues symptomatic of post-traumatic stress disorder.


  His device looks like a cross between a tuning fork and stethoscope. The two prongs on it have massage tips that are used to rub the temples, jawbone and sides of the skull and face.


  A small turnbuckle at the base of the two prongs allows for adjustments on the pressure of the two massage tips. The massager also has a small round indentation at the base to accommodate small pads of essential oils for aroma therapy.


  Meisch got the idea for his temple massager more than two decades ago when he used two earpieces on his sunglasses to rub his temples to fend off onset of a migraine. He said relaxing muscles can help relieve headaches, teeth grinding and jaw clenching.


  The device design has undergone fine tuning over the years, using better materials and the inclusion of the turnbuckle for pressure variance. But it remains essentially the same, a manual massager that offers complementary alternative medicine and therapy.


  “That’s what the military calls holistic therapy,” he said.


  At a time when far too many Americans, including veterans, are turning to pharmaceutical painkillers such as opioids, Meisch said his device offers a healthier option. It puts people in control of their own health, he said.


  Robert Morgan, 64, first tried the device after Meisch sent him one after the Cazadero inventor heard about Morgan’s ordeal during the 2017 wildfires. Morgan, a former resident of Journey’s End mobile home park, said the Tubbs fire left him with enduring stress and trauma.


  That October night years ago, Morgan used a water hose to help firefighters battle a blaze that destroyed most of the Santa Rosa mobile home park. He left Sonoma County shortly after the 2018 Camp fire sent him into “panic mode,” and settled in Menomonie, Wisconsin, with the help of his ex-wife.

  In the wake of the recent City Council election debacle, Ocala officials now plan to revamp election qualifications.


  This, of course, is a good idea. As we see it, there awaits an easy fix and a hard one. The issue is whether the city wants to help only itself, with no guarantee such a situation won't arise again, or work on reform that could benefit all of Florida.


  The council is tackling reform after Tyrone Oliver was elected in November, but then refused his seat after a 1986 felony drug conviction came to light.


  Florida's Constitution barred felons from voting and holding office until the state restored their rights. That changed a bit in November 2018, when voters approved Amendment 4 that automatically restored voting rights for felons who complete their sentences. Lawmakers conditioned that further last spring by mandating fully paying court-imposed fees, when applicable, as part of the sentence-fulfilling requirement.


  Oliver apparently paid his debt to society and had twice sought restoration of his rights since 2012. He has yet to win approval. It's unclear why because such cases are confidential.


  Oliver seemed to believe Amendment 4 permitted him to serve. Additionally, no one -- except Oliver himself -- was obligated to verify whether his record was clean.


  Yet faced with the circumstances of his past and the existing law, the council voted to not seat him. The city is now planning a special election for that seat.


  Currently, the city charter imposes two requirements to serve on the council: candidates must be Ocala residents for at least a year and qualified voters.


  But candidates also must file a residency affidavit affirming that \"he or she is qualified under the Constitution and the laws of Florida ... to hold the office of city councilman.\"


  Such language would, and should, prohibit convicted felons from running. But that only works if felons-turned candidates understand the Constitution to begin with -- and as Oliver showed, Amendment 4 has muddied the water.


  We have a couple of suggestions.


  The easiest change would be to spell out specifically in the charter that a felony conviction disqualifies someone as a candidate, while that's state law. The city also could require candidates to submit to a background check, conducted by the city clerk's office at the candidates' expense.


  Those are the easy steps.


  The more difficult way to bulletproof this situation would be for state lawmakers to fix the law so former felons, except those barred from voting under Amendment 4, could hold public office -- though that may require another constitutional amendment.


  Ocala could help the entire state by lobbying lawmakers to make such a change.


  Oliver's situation is unfortunate because he has rehabilitated his life, and seems committed to the civic good. He is more a victim of the state's previous foot-dragging on rights restoration than anything else.


  But the City Council could salvage his case, and make an important statement on criminal justice reform, by ensuring those like Oliver who transform their lives and want to repay society through public service can do so.
