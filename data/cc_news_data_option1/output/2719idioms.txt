The Newtown Township Police Department will hold its first town hall meeting from 7 to 8:30 p.m. July 23 at the township municipal building, 100 Municipal Drive.
   
 Residents of Newtown Township and Wrightstown are welcome to attend, but attendance at the in-person event will be limited to 20 people because of coronavirus concerns, officials said. Newtown Township police provide coverage for Wrightstown.
   
 Masks will be required of attendees, who will be seated on a first-come, first-served basis.
   
 "Due to mask requirements and our attempts to get people to freely open up on topics that may be discussed, the event will not be televised or recorded," Newtown Township Police Chief John Hearn said.
   
 Those unable to attend can email questions, concerns and issues to PoliceTownHall@newtownpa.gov.
   
 Hearn said that one of his goals when hired as chief in February of 2019 was to establish a regular schedule of town halls and frequently attend meetings of community groups.
   
 "Unfortunately in 2020, the COVID-19 crisis occurred which hampered those community outreach efforts, followed by the unfortunate incident in Minneapolis and subsequent instances of protest and civil unrest around the country," the chief said.
   
 "I, along with my board of supervisors, felt it was important to meet face to face and reiterate that the Newtown Township Police Department is here to serve and protect, and to reassure our community of our commitment to fairness, respect and dignity for everyone and to continue to build trust and legitimacy.
   
 "Although this is not an ideal time to encourage our residents to gather together, we felt the need to reassure our residents."
   
 A news release announcing the town hall stated it will be an opportunity for residents to "find out about policing in your neighborhoods, get an overview of our township police operations, how we uphold the highest ethical standards, promote accountability in our department and profession and strengthen constructive community engagement.
   
 "This is an opportunity to open the dialogue between our police and our community members, meet new friends and neighbors and discover that we are in this together."
   
 More town halls will be scheduled if response to this one is good, officials said.
   
 "We are desperately seeking a return to normal so that we can go back to our normal community engagement and relation functions such as coffee with a cop, water ice with a cop, etc," Hearn said.
   
 Newtown Township is one of many area police departments that, before the pandemic, held coffee with a cop and similar events to promote solid relations with the public.

In a significant statement, Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar has said that he does not believe that the ideology of Shiv Sena founder- patriarch, the late Balasaheb Thackeray was 'in sync' with that of its former ally Bharatiya Janata Party.      "The Balasaheb Thackeray that I knew, maybe you know him better... but I never felt that his (Balasaheb's) ideology, his working style was in sync with that of the BJP," the senior leader said.      The NCP chief's remark came in a marathon interview with 'Saamana' and 'Dopahar Ka Saamana' Group's Executive Editor Sanjay Raut on a wide variety of current interest topics.      In this context, Pawar said that Shiv Sena majorly contributed to the BJP's victory in the October 2019 assembly elections, helping the latter achieve the figure of 105 seats to emerge as the single largest party in the state.      "I think, if the Sena had not been the BJP's ally, then that figure (105), would have been around 40-50 seats. The BJP leaders took Shiv Sena for granted though it helped them win 105 seats," Pawar asserted, sparking off a potential political row with the BJP.      The NCP chief's response was to a query by Raut whether it was strange how a party (BJP) which was thrown up as the single-largest group failed to form the state government or a miracle which ultimately an unexpected alliance of Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress took power in November 2019.      Brushing aside suggestions that it was some kind of a 'miracle', Pawar hinted that the BJP even committed the error of taking the "voter for granted", referring to then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' oft-repeated slogan - "Mee Punha Yaeena (I will return).      "When a political leader makes such a statement, the voters get the impression that it is 'hubris' and they decide to teach him a lesson. When the people think that we (politicians) are crossing the limits, they don't like it. This doesn't work in politics," Pawar explained.      Recalling the previous Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1995, he said it was completely under the control of Sena and Balasaheb Thackeray, but in the next round from 2014-2019, the BJP had virtually 'sidelined' Sena, it conveyed the notion that "nobody else can rule", treated the people as a 'jaagir' (fiefdom), which ultimately led to (BJP's) the debacle.      Citing similar historical instances, the NCP supremo said a leader like Indira Gandhi with tremendous mass support had to taste defeat, even Atal Bihar Vajpayee was vanquished, proving that "the common man of this country is more intelligent than the leaders when it comes to his democratic rights".      Dwelling on Balasaheb Thackeray's style of functioning, Pawar fondly recalled how he always respected people, like Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, but he was not always opposed to the Congress, nor did he harbour any hatred for the party (Congress).      "He was a fearless yet forgiving personality. Such magnanimous people are rare in politics. He supported Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and surprisingly, even did not put up Sena candidates for the next elections to stand by her. This was shocking and unprecedented. He could maintain excellent personal relations even with his staunch political opponents, and was never bothered about the repercussions. Once, he even ensured that Supriya Sule should get elected unopposed. Only Balasaheb Thackeray could do all this and he did that," Pawar said.      To a query whether Pawar wielded the 'remote control', the NCP chief laughingly brushed aside the suggestion and said that the three-party government is a "successful experiment" in the state with Uddhav Thackeray doing an excellent job as CM.      Giving full marks to the government's performance, Pawar - the chief architect of the MVA asserted: "No... none of these... I am not a headmaster, not a remote control... this is a democratic government and cannot be run by any remote control... the government is run by the CM and his council of ministers."      Incidentally, this is the first time that a top national leader has been interviewed for the 'Saamana' by Raut, who has earlier done hundreds of interview sessions with Balasaheb Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray, and now plans to grill some other national leaders soon.

Un uomo di 32 anni residente in Emilia-Romagna è stato denunciato dai Carabinieri con l'accusa di avere perseguitato e minacciato una 41enne che vive nel Bolognese e che aveva conosciuto qualche mese fa su Instagram.   Secondo quanto è stato ricostruito, i due avevano cominciato a scriversi lo scorso aprile, durante il lockdown, iniziando una relazione.   Terminato il periodo di isolamento forzato, la donna si è mostrata meno disponibile a chattare e lui, convinto che lo tradisse, ha iniziato a tempestarla di chiamate e messaggi.   Anche quando lei ha interrotto i rapporti, l'uomo ha continuato a scriverle e a chiamarla, arrivando a minacciarla, se non fosse tornata con lui, di pubblicare alcune foto intime che lei gli aveva mandato. Ci sono state anche minacce di morte con frasi come "ti vengo ad ammazzare con la mia pistola".   Dopo che la donna si è rivolta all'Arma, visti i precedenti del 32enne per reati violenti come lesioni e percosse, è stato attivato il 'codice rosso': in pochi giorni è stata autorizzata una perquisizione a casa dell'uomo, dove è stata trovata la pistola, una scacciacani. L'uomo è accusato di persecutori, minacce e tentata diffusione illecita di immagini o video sessualmente espliciti.

La battaglia  del panino contro la mensa scolastica diventa un compito per le vacanze.

Page said the safety and comfort of knowing most of her patients and neighbors personally is a big draw for her and others in small towns across the Midwest.
 “We really don’t have any strangers around you, I can still let my kids ride their bikes around town and not worry much about them,” she said. “I am amazed at how many people come back and then start families and have children here themselves.”
 Living, working and giving care to Native communitiesDiane Inch made the leap to providing rural health care a decade ago and has never looked back.
 Inch, her husband and their two children moved to Fort Thompson about 10 years ago after deciding to relocate from Syracuse, N.Y., to rural America.
 They chose Fort Thompson, a town of 1,280 people on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, by simply picking a spot on the map.
 “It was blind faith. We just took a jump and have never regretted it,” she said. “When you pull into Fort Thompson, it is not the most inviting town, there’s no doubt about it. But when you get to know the people and get to know the ins and outs, there’s a lot more to Fort Thompson than meets the eye.”
 Inch, 49, is a physician’s assistant at the small Horizon Health Care clinic in Martin, a town of about 1,100 people on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
 Martin is roughly 180 miles from her home, but Inch avoids the commute by living four days a week in a small apartment attached to the clinic.
 Inch, who is not Native American, said she feels deeply enriched by living and working in reservation communities.
 “It’s such a family-centered way of life in that they not only look out for each other, but take care of each other in the extended family,” she said.
 Inch feels as though she is now part of that family. At the clinic, she provides a wide range of critical health services that might be out of reach for some patients who are caught in generational poverty and may not have transportation or access to health care anywhere else.
 Depending on the day, Inch might provide treatment, triage or simply advice on a wide variety of conditions, ranging from aiding diabetics, to helping someone with kidney failure manage dialysis, to providing referrals for mental-health services, to helping new mothers care for their babies.
 “We’re seeing babies that come to us for their first appointment that have multiple genetic problems and conditions, and they’re not seeing a pediatrician, they’re seeing us,” she said.
 Inch has also participated in programming to encourage physical exercise and healthful cooking and has helped patients arrange for transportation to appointments.
 Being involved in her hometown and also playing a critical role in Martin gives Inch satisfaction she might not get working as part of a large staff at a big-city hospital, she said.
 “Definitely there are challenges out here as we are kind of all types of health care wrapped into one,” she said. “But I just want to make sure those who need health care are able to get it.”

Although we’ve done a pretty good job of keeping the number of positive COVID-19 cases low, they are rising daily. And I gotta ask, why would Bristol Motor Speedway and our county mayor invite 30,000 race fans to come to our towns to shop, sleep and eat?
 Of course, BMS is taking every precaution to minimize COVID-19 risks for fans, employees and vendors while within the facility, but what about the time the fans spend and the places they go before and after the race? No one will be monitoring temperatures or asking them to wear masks while they are out and about. I have heard of no plan to even attempt to ensure the safety and well- being for those of us that live here.
 The fact that there is an assumption of risk to the ticket buyer, which includes the inability to hold BMS liable should an attendee contract the virus, seems to be reason enough NOT to have fans at the race. Has any due diligence for the protection of our community been done?
 Residents of the Tri-Cities should not be used as guinea pigs for NASCAR’s and BMS’ experiment of having tens of thousands of fans, from who knows where, attend the race during a pandemic. I’m a race fan myself, but I think this is irresponsible, self-serving and greedy, demonstrating total disregard for the health and well-being of those of us that live here. Run the race, but keep the fans at home.

 Americans should embrace diversity
 Recently I have taken a serious look at the word “American” and asked if I was living up to its ideals. Our founding fathers used the phrase “all men are created equal.” The 13th and 15th Amendments, the Civil War, the Civil Rights Act, and several recent Supreme Court decisions all reinforce the idea so well stated in our Declaration of Independence.
 In none of these documents or decisions is the basic idea challenged. Only in the Civil War was the idea challenged, and it was defeated on the battlefield and by the 13th and 15th Amendments but not in the hearts of many of the Southern participants. In the Constitution the statement that a slave was viewed as 3/5 of a human being could be viewed as nonsupport also.
 What does the phrase “all men” mean? I believe it should mean all people or all humans. What does “created equal” mean? I believe it means, in the context of the Constitution, every member of our society should have an equal opportunity at achieving the American dream, not equal outcomes but equal opportunity.
 Thus, it seems that the only thing that should matter in human endeavor is the content of our character, work ethic and ability to manage diversity. The elimination of the distractions of race, creed, sex, etc., would lead us closer to the ideals in our Constitution. Thus, it is a worthy endeavor and let’s all participate in helping to make it happen. There is truly a richness in diversity if we will only embrace it. Only then can we all become equal Americans!

 Police are doing a dangerous job
 After Rayshard Brooks was killed by police in Atlanta, a TV reporter asked what can we do to change this, as though that were really difficult.
 The answer is simple. When confronted by police, behave in a respectful, cooperative manner, and do exactly what you are told. Do not argue, resist, struggle, fight or grab for the officer’s weapon.
 Police are guardians of our freedom and civil rights. We want them to return safely to their families and be back on duty the next day. Anyone who threatens a police officer with a weapon that could kill or injure him or even just render him incapable of self-defense should expect to be shot.
 I wish the Black Lives Matter organization would focus some of their attention on how Black Americans behave and respect our laws instead of just on our brave police who are doing a dangerous but necessary job.
 There are millions of good law-abiding Black Americans. Most of them would like to see more police in their neighborhoods so they would be safer from gangs and drug dealers. The vast majority of our police are great and not racially biased. The demand by BLM that police stand down from policing in Black communities is already resulting in increased crime and hundreds of more Blacks being killed in their own neighborhoods. Those Black lives should also matter.

“To me, whether they’re real or not, it’s a nice symbol that falling in love is like seeing dinosaurs in the desert,” Barbakow says. “There’s a transcendent wonder in that. You can intellectualize it that way. But it’s also just fun, like, ‘Let’s put some dinosaurs in the movie.’ ”
 In Siara’s mind, the dinosaurs are not really about literal truth but something more intangible. “Thinking about my wedding day or when I held my daughter in my arms for the first time, those are moments in life that words cannot describe — and the only way they could get better is basically if you have dinosaurs on the horizon,” he says. “It’s that feeling that we were always after.”
 That feeling was more than enough for Milioti. “I remember that moment in the script really took my breath away,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s so beautiful. That’s love.’ It’s like a God moment or something, not to put too fine a point on it. I love a little bit of magical realism.”
 As Samberg sees it, the real message of that final shot of the dinosaurs in the distance is that each of us, with our own personal baggage of hopes and fears and foibles, ultimately makes our own reality.

The nation that held its breath is now united in grief. Jack Charlton's passing has touched Irish people in the way that the exploits of his team did.It's news that goes beyond football. The range of tributes this morning has emphasised that; there are people with a minimal interest in the sport saddened because they know that Charlton's importance on these shores went far beyond the simple business of 11 v 11.We love our nostalgia in these parts. Reeling In The Years takes a summer slot just after the main evening news for a reason. If the makers ever had to distill the entire series down to a thirty minute highlights package, they couldn't leave Big Jack out of the equation. They could build the thing around his picture.The Euro '88 redux is marvelous and USA '94 left an imprint too, but there isn't a feelgood montage to rival the Italia '90 throwback. Men from an era where men crying was largely frowned upon, reduced to tears by the enormity of it all.Lockdown and the loss of this summer's Euros allowed RTE and TG4 to play out the greatest hits and give a younger generation a more detailed insight into the stories they likely grew up hearing about.Even if you were a child for those glory years (for context - I was 7 when O'Leary stuck the ball in the net) you are now old enough to fully appreciate how lucky you are to be able to remember it. We may never live through anything like that again.In the digital age, we are far too cynical, self obsessed or self aware to lose control in a similar way. You don't need a hastily recorded camera phone clip to remember where you were. There was something wonderfully authentic and innocent about the adventures of Jack's Army. Nothing compares to the first time.The charismatic figure to the forefront of a story, the Englishman in Ireland, which was a quirky subplot in itself, had already lived through hysteria.He was a 1966 World Cup winner, and a Leeds legend, appointed in typically chaotic FAI fashion when other candidates were initially preferred.His brief was simple - to try and win games and succeed where other managers had failed by securing a passage to a major finals.There are layers to the debate about his impact, and whether the gatekeepers of the sport in this country ever truly capitalised on it.He was always open about his way of playing the game. Chris Waddle spoke recently on these pages about his uncompromising approach at Newcastle, his last job before his career went in an unexpected direction, so the FAI knew what they were getting on that score.Charlton would have loved to manage England, yet he probably didn't fit the profile of what they envisaged for their national team. So he came back to haunt them instead, and they then appointed Graham Taylor, a football man with a not dissimilar philosophy.By then, Charlton was embedded in Irish hearts.There are reporters who worked the beat through that period that are far better placed to tell stories about the man. They were provided with extraordinary access and, on our away trips, it's not unusual for a veteran to launch into some anecdote or other that contrasted sharply with the realities of the present day.Back in 2011, this writer did have the pleasure of an afternoon in the Westbury Hotel in his company. Jack was likely fielding the type of queries he had faced thousands of times in these parts. By his own admission, the mind wasn't as sharp as it used to be.His wife Pat sat next to him, reading the newspaper but also listening intently and interjecting to fill gaps when he stalled in the search for an answer.In polite small talk, they had questions about the various characters they had encountered in his Irish pomp. Pat enquired about Johnny Logan's whereabouts. &quot;Daniel O'Donnell's married now, isn't he?&quot; said Jack.Every few minutes, well-wishers would come over for a word or a photo.But the most illuminating part of the experience was when we stumbled into discussion about his trip to the 1986 World Cup, a scouting mission for his Irish brief.All of a sudden, he sprung to life, and the delivery was concise. The Guy Thys managed Belgium side - an underdog that went all the way to the semis - were the purpose of the mission as they were Ireland's Euros opponents.He spoke of the importance of their full backs and how they utilised space. Within seconds, he was taking mobile phones and coffee cups, casting them as Houghton and Aldridge or Moran and McCarthy, and explaining the instructions he gave to his players when the time came around.&quot;Everyone knew what they were doing,&quot; he asserted, and he was right considering that Ireland would top that qualifying group.&ldquo;Once he starts, you'll never stop him talking,&rdquo; laughed Pat, when the tactics clinic had wound down.There was always a method to what purists dismissed as madness.The end justified his means.A few weeks back on June 25, we had the 30 year anniversary of the penalty shootout with Romania.It was a day of glorious sunshine, and even in this most curious of years, it brought many Irish people back to a different place and time, the images and celebrations that will last for a lifetime, often tied in with thoughts of those who are no longer with us or those that have struggled most during the horrible uncertainty of Covid-19.The picture of Jack, leaning on the edge of a dugout in Genoa after Packie Bonner saved Daniel Timofte's penalty, biting on his knuckle to perhaps hide his emotions before David O'Leary's decisive kick, is embedded in the mind. He knew that something was historic was about to happen, bigger than even he might have realised.It feels trite to say thanks for the memories. Jack Charlton's legacy was so much greater than that.

In early versions of the script, Siara says, “it was a little more clear what maybe the main interpretation could be.” But after Samberg came on board, he and his Lonely Island producing partners, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, helped push the film’s conclusion in a more ambiguous direction.
 “We definitely talked about the ending _a lot_ ,” Samberg says. “There were many iterations written and even many iterations shot and cut together and screened for small friends-and-family screenings.”
 The goal all along was to land somewhere in the space between a traditional sort of pro-love-and-marriage rom-com happy ending and a slightly darker, more open-ended one that reflects the uncertainty of any romantic venture. “It was a real push-and-pull,” Samberg says. “We didn’t want the ending to feel saccharine, like, ‘Yay, everything works out!’ That felt untrue to the tone of the movie and the promise you had made with the characters. But at the same time you don’t want to end on a note that’s bitter and depressing. It was a delicate balance.”
 Along the way, Siara, like Sarah in the film, delved into some of the more speculative and exotic corners of research into the physics of space and time. “I had a nice YouTube internet spiral of looking into black holes and string theory and found some science papers on the Cauchy horizon,” Siara says. (Fun fact: The physicist with whom Sarah speaks over Skype in the film is Clifford Johnson, an actual theoretical physicist at USC who has served as a scientific consultant on a number of Marvel Studios films.)

The 45th was supposed to be major. Since the mid 1970s, Indian Hills Country Club has been the gathering spot each summer for a men's tennis event, one that is perhaps equal parts competition and social gathering.
   
 Next week, July 13-19, will mark the 45th of those gatherings.
   
 As recently as last month, the status of No. 45 was in question. COVID-19 has halted sports events worldwide. The club was not going to let any of its tournament participants, members, staff or the family and friends who gather to watch play each summer be in any sort of jeopardy of exposure to the virus. Safety had to be the priority.
   
 One person, a self-proclaimed optimist, believed all along that by the time July rolled around, the Pritchett-Moore Men's City Invitational would happen. And it will, though it won't be the tournament Tuscaloosa has come to be familiar with.
   
 "As most people will tell you, I'm a pretty optimistic guy in general and a pretty positive thinker. I always planned that we would have it or some version of it. When the mayor and governor started opening things up again, that's when we talked about it and decided it was something we could do outside. We've got a pretty big space here at the club, and we can space people out. Tennis is not something that you have to do. We're going to hold the tournament, and people who feel good enough, and they're healthy, and they want to come out and participate and play tennis--we decided we'd offer that venue for them," said Indian Hills Country Club's Director of Tennis, Keith Swindoll.
   
 "Through the years, this has become such a social event as much as a tennis event. It's all about the tennis this year. It's changed drastically, but I'm just grateful that we're going to play tennis. We've really struggled and talked about what would be the best way to go about this and do something safely and still be able to have it. There are so many people screaming for some normalcy. During this time, it's been hard to be normal with anything. We're putting a lot of different protocol in place. We're not going to have a big player party, and we're not going to have the food and stuff that we normally have. We will have more swag. And we'll be using more tennis balls. And we're having more people to be here, labor wise, to keep everything clean and safe. We're just happy we're getting to be able to have it because it didn't look very promising a couple of months ago."
   
 One of the main differences will be the crowd. There won't be any. The participants will be encouraged to just allow one friend or family member to attend, and, whoever does come, including players between matches, is encouraged to wear a mask. This year, there won't be a player party, which has always been a popular event. Those attending are encouraged to bring their own chairs. Participants should bring their own water, coolers, ice and towels. The tournament will provide individually wrapped snacks for the participants as well as Gatorade and bottled water in lieu of water in coolers placed on the court. Social distancing will be required of all. The tennis pro shop, the heart of the facility, will allow only limited access inside. And cleaning, lots of sanitizing, will be constant.
   
 "The hanging around and that sort of thing will be different, but we're just glad we're getting to play," Swindoll said. "The entire time we were hoping we were going to be able to have the tournament if we could do it safely for the players and for my staff. We decided that we feel like we can. It's everybody's choice whether or not they want to play in it. We want everyone to be safe. That's our number one priority."
   
 Swindoll said the downtime tennis pros and players alike have had in the recent months allowed for many a ZOOM call and idea sharing between clubs around the country as well as local players.
   
 "As other places started opening up and having tournaments, I saw how people were doing it safely and how much fun people would have just being able to get out and get some exercise, be outside--that was probably the final thing that let us know we could do it safely."
   
 Thursday, July 9 at midnight is the deadline for player registration. Registration is online at https://tennislink.usta.com/tournaments. The tournament features singles ($65) and doubles ($40 per player) play. Despite restrictions, Swindoll says the response for participation is as strong as ever. He's seeing no drop.
   
 What will possibly change is the format. On weeknights, play begins at 5 p.m. Play begins at 8 a.m. on the weekend. In the past, singles has been played Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights with doubles beginning on Wednesday and again Friday. This year doubles may start as early as Monday night because the doubles portion of the tournament has typically been the biggest draw. Moving some doubles to earlier in the week will help spread the congregation out more.
   
 "We're so thankful that we can have this for the players. We're really trying to emphasize the actual playing," Swindoll said. "This year's tournament is for the players more than anything."
   
 And, as far as missing out on a milestone party, Swindoll said they are already planning a celebration for number 46.
   
 "Next year I can promise everybody, players and spectators alike, we will have the party to end all parties next year. I think we'll all be ready for it."

Disputa tra marito e moglie. La donna di 42 anni riminese, trasferitasi dopo il matrimonio a Faenza con il consorte e stata condannata con rito abbreviato. Fra le circostanze piu gravi, anche un'aggressione con un coltello, che la donna - difesa dal legale Lucia Varliero del foro di Rimini - ha ripetutamente negato. Una storia durata oltre 6 anni che, solo dopo tanto tempo il marito e riuscito a trovare la forza di sporgere denuncia alla Polizia, avviando anche le pratiche di separazione. La donna, infatti, per tutto questo tempo, avrebbe picchiato il marito con calci, schiaffi e perfino con colpi di matterello, talvolta anche in presenza dei figli piccoli. Prima che il processo prendesse piede in tribunale a Ravenna, la polizia di Stato aveva notificato alla donna l'ordinanza di allontanamento dalla casa coniugale e il divieto di avvicinamento, affidando i bambini al padre.

It’s a new beginning for Mount Carmel with the swearing in of Vice Mayor Jennifer Williams as mayor and Alderman Pat Stilwell as vice mayor after the Board of Mayor and Aldermen accepted the resignations of former Mayor Chris Jones and Alderman Carl Wolfe. Hopefully, Mayor Williams will receive the support of a majority of the BMA in her call to end the divisiveness that has plagued the BMA for years.
 Residents thought they ended the most contentious period in the town’s history in 2016 when they fired Larry Frost, a mayor who led the town through repeated turmoil, as well as his chief supporter, and elected Chris Jones as mayor. Jones said he would end the bickering and dissension.
 “I think that the citizens wanted to see a change. They wanted to be more involved in our community, and now we’ve got a good BMA that’s willing to work with all the citizens, get input and get us a game plan,” Jones said. “We need to set some goals that will move us in a positive direction and get everyone in the city to work together toward these goals.”
 If only that had come to fruition.
 “We’re going to be able to work together and achieve the goals that we set together,” Jones said at that time. But within a year, it would become known that Jones allegedly embezzled $394,000 from his grandmother before she died in 2016, resulting in a charge of theft over $250,000 pending in Hawkins County Circuit Court. Jones also faces a civil lawsuit in the amount of $571,000 filed by his mother and two uncles.
 Then, responding to a reported stabbing at a Kingsport motel last April, police found Jones, 48, with his throat cut and a serious wound to his arm. Jones told police he fell on a knife. Free on a $100,000 bond from his arrest on the theft charge, Jones was arrested May 28 and charged with domestic assault after allegedly pushing his girlfriend during an argument.
 A day after being arraigned on the domestic assault charge, he was arrested on a charge of felony criminal simulation and two counts of criminal impersonation on indictment by a grand jury. That indictment stemmed from an incident in January where he allegedly posed as a police officer asking to see surveillance video. Finally, Jones, along with Wolfe, became the object of a writ of ouster on grounds of official misconduct related to an alleged bogus eviction notice.
 “I hope we can move forward,” Williams said upon assuming the mayor’s chair. “We’ve got a great community. Great employees. We’ve got a good city manager, so I think we can move forward and do the right thing for the town of Mount Carmel.”
 In keeping the best interests of residents as her priority, Mayor Williams brings a breath of fresh air to the community, and we join residents in wishing her the best.
