_Policy recession._ When central banks leave policy rates too high relative to the economy’s “neutral” rate, they tighten financial conditions and credit intermediation, and, with a lag, choke off the expansion. This risk remains modest — outside of the U.S. rates are already rock bottom or even negative, while the Federal Reserve has delivered a surprise cut of 50 basis points. Outside of the monetary policy response, the G7 finance ministers have also pledged fiscal support.

February data pointed to another improvement in the rate of growth of services activity as companies reacted positively to strong gains in new work, according to IHS Markit India Services Purchasing Managers Index PMI released on Wednesday. The welcoming news was accompanied by a renewed increase in new export orders and strengthening business confidence. Meanwhile, price data showed a marked but softer upturn in input costs and only modest rate of output charge inflation.The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index increased for the fifth successive month in February -- from 55.5 in January to 57.5 -- after dipping to a 19-month low in September 2019. The latest figure highlighted the quickest expansion in services output since January 2013.Those companies that reported higher business activity commented on strengthening demand, supportive economic conditions and accommodative public policies. Service providers enjoyed a marked increase in new work intakes during February, the second-fastest in over seven years. In some cases, the upturn in sales was linked to successful advertising.As was the case for business activity, the rise in new orders was widespread across the five monitored categories and led by consumer services. A return to growth of new orders from abroad contributed to the increase in total sales. The pace of expansion in international demand for Indian services was moderate, but above its long-run average.Projects in the pipeline, supportive market conditions, marketing efforts and the offering of new services all contributed to a stronger degree of optimism among firms that output will increase in the year ahead. Finance, insurance and consumer services firms were the most confident during February. Positive gains in new work across the manufacturing and service sectors suggest that private sector output will likely increase markedly again in March, boding well for final quarter GDP following expectations of a flat growth rate in Q3 FY 2019-20, said Principal Economist at IHS Markit Pollyanna de Lima.February data also showed that robust increases in both manufacturing and services output pushed the growth of private sector business activity to an eight-year high. The Composite PMI Output Index was up from 56.3 in January to 57.6, remaining above its long-run average of 54.6. Growth of aggregate new orders held close to Januarys seven-year high.Robust increases were noted among goods producers and service providers, with the sharper rate of expansion among the former. The IHS Markit India Services PMI is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 service sector companies. The sectors covered include consumer excluding retail, transport, information, communication, finance, insurance, real estate and business services.The panel is stratified by detailed sector and company workforce size, based on contributions to GDP.

"A very special episode of _Riverdale_ tomorrow night," Aguirre-Sacasa wrote. "Watch it with some comfort food. Tomato soup, perhaps."
 If Jughead does turn out to actually be really and truly dead, it will be a further shakeup for the series as it makes its way towards Season 5. Last month, two big departures were announced for _Riverdale_ with Marisol Nichols, who plays Hermione Lodge, and Skeet Ulrich, who plays Jughead's father F.P. Jones, not returning in Season 5. It would also leave fans wondering what's next for the popular series which has already prompted some questions, such as whether there will be a time jump between Season 4 and Season 5. Season 4 is senior year for the show's characters and with its in-universe companion series Katy Keene set several years into the future already, many fans believe there will be a big jump to line Riverdale up with Katy Keene.
 Of course, even with Aguirre-Sacasa's tease it's entirely possible that Jughead is not actually dead. _Riverdale_ is a series that has done some truly wild things so far in its run and somehow having Jughead either come back from the dead or not actually be dead wouldn't even be the most bizarre twist. It's also just incredibly hard to imagine the show going through such a massive shakeup, especially as Jughead has been the series' narrator since the beginning -- though how reliable he is in that capacity is also up for debate.
 Whatever Jughead's actually situation, there's sure to be more details coming -- and more questions as well -- with Wednesday's "To Die For", which you can check out the synopsis for below.

His idea made sense theoretically, but it's never been observed in natural materials. Now, we have our first signs of it happening in the lab.
 Once again we're indebted to quantum physics for the discovery. Scientists were able to generate what they call "experimental signatures" of Nagaoka ferromagnetism (as it came to be named) in a tightly controlled, custom-made quantum electrical system.
 While it's too early to use this new magnetism setup practically, what makes the finding exciting is the indication that Nagaoka's 54-year-old prediction is right; and that could have a major impact on how quantum systems of the future get developed.
 "The results were crystal clear: we demonstrated Nagaoka ferromagnetism," says quantum physicist Lieven Vandersypen, from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
 "When we started working on this project, I wasn't sure whether the experiment would be possible, because the physics is so different from anything else that we have ever studied in our lab."
 The simplest way to think about Nagaoka ferromagnetism is as a child's puzzle game, the one with sliding blocks you have to put into a picture or pattern. In this analogy, each block is an electron with its own spin or alignment.

Asian shares struggled to find their footing on Wednesday and bonds held stunning gains, as an emergency rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve seemed to stoke rather than soothe fears over the coronavirus widening global economic fallout.The surprise 50 basis point cut, the Feds first off- schedule move since the depths of the financial crisis more than a decade ago, came with comments highlighting both the scale of the challenge and the limits of monetary policy. MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2, though most of the gains were confined to South Korea where the government announced a big stimulus package.European futures pointed to a steady open, with FTSE futures flat and EuroSTOXX 50 futures up 0.3. After Wall Street tumbled overnight, futures for the SP 500 rose 1.4 on the resurgent performance of Joe Biden in Democratic Party primaries. A moderate, Biden is now set up as the main challenger to self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders.Currencies and bonds showed little such exuberance. The dollar remained on the back foot and the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which falls when prices rise, held at 0.9748 - not far over the once-unimaginable low of 0.9060 hit overnight. U.S. Treasuries are moving even lower and credit spreads are widening in Asia today. That is not the usual effect that you would see from a movie like this, said Rishi Jalan, Citigroup co-head of debt capital markets syndication.This decision shows the coronavirus impact is real and could have a material impact on growth. For market participants, it shows thinking of The Fed is expecting something that we have not yet priced in. Japans Nikkei closed flat, while Australias SPASX 200 fell 1.7. Stocks in Hong Kong and China traded either side of flat.Korean stocks bucked broader weakness, rising 2 after the government announced a 9.8 billion stimulus package to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak. The dollar touched a five-month low against the safe-haven Japanese yen and slipped against most other Asian currencies.Given the way that the markets reacted, its telling you that theres a little bit of panic, said Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Janus Henderson in Singapore. Theyre a bit worried that interest rate cuts are not going to make a massive difference...and whats going to be required is probably going to be more fiscal stimulus, he said, his fund having invested, for example, in Chinese cement and construction stocks in anticipation of more government support measures.CUTS ARENT ENOUGH The Feds surprise move followed a massive shift in money market pricing late last week.Futures swung rapidly to expect such a cut at the Feds March meeting. Now they imply another 50 basis points of easing by July, even as the investors and the Fed itself raise questions about the efficacy of easing to deal with a public health crisis.We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection, it wont fix a broken supply chain we get that, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference. More than 3,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus, about 3.4 of those infected - far above the seasonal flus fatality rate of under 1.It continues to spread quickly beyond the epicenter in China, with Italy overnight reporting a jump in deaths to 79 and South Korea reporting more than 500 new cases on Wednesday. The question here is whether a conventional interest rate response is sufficient, said Sameer Goel, chief strategist, Asia macro, at Deutsche Bank in Singapore.Its still not clear how big the problem ultimately is, or could be, and until you know that, its hard to know how much medicine to apply to it. In currencies, the U.S. dollar clawed back some of its losses on the euro and yen but was broadly on the back foot.It last traded at 0.6596 per Australian dollar and 1.1160 per euro. After falling to as low as 106.84 yen, the dollar pared losses to buy 107.42 yen by midafternoon. Oil prices firmed on expectations of production cuts, with Brent rising 90 cents to 52.79 per barrel and U.S. crude up 1.9 at 48.06 a barrel.Gold rose 0.2 to 1642.21 an ounce.

A resurgent Joe Biden rode a wave of momentum to win at least eight states on Super Tuesday and Bernie Sanders was leading in the biggest race in California, setting up a one-on-one battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. In a surprisingly strong showing, Biden rolled to victories across the South, Midwest, and New England on the biggest day of voting in the Democratic campaign. Americans in 14 states cast ballots for a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign, said Biden, the former vice president who had performed poorly in the first three nominating contests but broke through with a win in South Carolina. We are very much alive, he told roaring supporters in Los Angeles.Sanders, the one-time front-runner who had hoped to take a big step toward the nomination on Tuesday, won Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont, Edison Research said. Fox News and AP projected Sanders won California, whose 415 delegates represent the largest haul in the nominating contest. But Edison Research and other networks held off declaring a winner as results trickled in.With overwhelming support from African American, moderate and older voters, Biden swept to wins in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia. The second biggest prize Texas and Maine were too close to call. Sanders was slightly trailing Biden in Texas, a state he had heavily invested in and had hoped to win given its sizeable Latino population.It was a spectacular turn of events for Biden, whose campaign was on life support after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Until a week ago he trailed Sanders in most state and national polls. Bidens blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday provided a burst of new momentum, fueling a wave of endorsements from elected Democratic officials and former presidential rivals including Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota before voting began on Super Tuesday.ONE-THIRD UP FOR GRABSMore than one-third of the delegates who will pick the eventual nominee at a July convention were up for grabs in the primaries on Tuesday, which provided some clarity at last in a muddled race for the White House.The results also left Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who spent more than half a billion dollars on advertising, largely out of the running, with his only victory coming in the U.S. territory of American Samoa. Bloomberg campaign officials said he would reassess whether to stay in the race on Wednesday, but they said that did not mean he would drop out.Biden was hoping to stay within reach of Sanders in delegates, giving him a chance to catch up as the race moved on. But after Tuesday, he led Sanders in delegates for the day 241 to 174, with hundreds more to be allocated. Overall, Biden leads Sanders in delegates 294 to 234.Without naming him, Sanders took direct aim at Biden during a rally with supporters in Vermont, criticizing his 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq and his support for global trade deals that Sanders opposed. Were going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country, Sanders said.Biden accomplished his main Super Tuesday goal of muscling aside Bloomberg and consolidating support from moderates to turn the race into a one-on-one contest against Sanders.BIDEN POPULAR WITH BLACK VOTERSBiden repeated his strong performance with black voters in South Carolina on Saturday. Edison Research exit polls showed Biden winning large majorities of African-American voters in the South. His showing was further fueled by strong support among an older people, college graduates and those who considered themselves liberal or moderate.Sanders countered with a strong showing among Latinos, young people, and white men, helping him to wins in the West. The results were disappointing for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who finished well behind Sanders and Biden in most states and trailed them in her home state of Massachusetts.Bloomberg was a wild card heading into the voting, as he joined the competition for the first time. He was winning more than 15 of the vote, enough to pick up some delegates, in Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, Utah, California and Arkansas. The moderate Bloomberg skipped the first four contests and bombarded Super Tuesday and later voting states with ads, but saw his poll numbers slip after coming under fire during Democratic debates over past comments criticized as sexist and a policing policy he employed as New Yorks mayor seen as racially discriminatory.Biden is hoping to build a bridge between progressive Democrats desire for big structural change and more moderate Democrats yearning for a candidate who will be able to win over enough independents and Republicans to oust Trump. That effort gained fresh momentum on the eve of Tuesdays voting as moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsed Biden after withdrawing from the race.Biden pulled off his victories despite being vastly outspent on ads by Bloomberg, who had spent 377 million on ads by Feb. 23, and Sanders, who spent 20 million. Biden spent 4.7 million during the same period, according to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks ad spending and content. The pace of the Democratic race begins to accelerate after Super Tuesday, with 11 more states voting by the end of March. By then, nearly two-thirds of the delegates will have been allotted.The next contests, on March 10, will be in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state.
