 Former Academy of Richmond County student Ray Mercer won the Olympic gold medal as a heavyweight boxer when he knocked out Baik Hyun-man of South Korea at the 2:16 mark of the first round.
   
 The Army infantryman discovered his talent in the military when an Army boxing coach convinced the young soldier to become a sparing partner for the camp heavyweight champ.
   
 Although he had no boxing experience, Mercer said he agreed because it got him out of marching in the snow.
   
 Soon, he was pummeling the camp champ regularly, and the rest is history.

The rock trio composed of Dainéal Parker, Daniel Alden, and Joshua Harris delivers an anthemic and cinematic track produced by Kyle Mangels, reflecting on lead vocalist Dainéal Parker’s young love story. "This is the true story of one teenage runaway falling in love with another on the streets of Portland, OR., in the late 90s,” Parker explains. “I normally shy away from writing anything too personal or plainly autobiographical, but the vibe of this song just took me right back to those hot days and cold nights I spent wrapped around the finger of a girl, and our summer trying to find couches to crash on but often settling for cardboard.” Lone Kodiak brings a vast and atmospheric sound, blended with intimate and heartfelt storytelling depicting head over heels love and the unpredictable adventure of a teenage love story. Parker also reflects on the last thing this girl told him that became a huge inspiration lyrically and emotionally for the track. “September inevitably came and a friend's family took me in for the school year, but the streets weren't ready to let her go and we lost touch, but not before she left me with maybe the best thing anyone's ever said to me: ‘I wanna hear my favorite songs sung by you’" explains Parker. The line ‘I wanna hear my favorite songs sung by you’ rings throughout the track bringing you right along the melancholic, yet optimistic story of young love and heartbreak.

Cody Walker has praised the courage of fellow Indigenous star Tyrone Peachey for calling out what he believed to be a racial slur in an NRL game last weekend.
 Ahead of South Sydney's elimination final clash with Newcastle, Walker said Peachey had shown bravery to speak up against another NRL player because it can be difficult to do.
 Peachey accused Knights backrower Mitch Barnett of slinging a racial slur at him in last weekend's match on the Gold Coast.
 Barnett denies the claim and the two have been forced by the NRL to attend a conciliation meeting as no evidence was found to confirm or deny the incident.
 Walker is a proud Indigenous leader in the game and reached out to Peachey to show him support, but says he is comfortable the NRL has handled the matter as best as possible.
 "There's obviously an investigation, there's not too much evidence, it's a 'he said, she said' type of situation so it's a hard one for the NRL to get to the bottom of it," Walker said.
 "They're still going through a conciliation process.
 "I messaged Tyrone to make sure that he had the full support of the playing group.
 "I admire his courage in speaking about these sorts of things because I understand it could be difficult."
 However, the 30-year-old Rabbitohs star feels society takes three steps forwards and two backwards in matters of racism.
 Walker said he had heard reports of similar incidents at regional rugby league games in recent weeks, adding to his frustration.
 "It's going to be hard to eliminate it but I feel like we're taking two or three steps forward, and then these sorts of things pop up and we knock it on the head straight away," he said.
 "(It's about) education, making sure we understand how the player feels and how the racism is brought onto a player and the way they feel.
 "The way we get rid of it, we just keep calling it out and knock it on the head."
 It comes as Walker prepares to face the Knights in Sunday's elimination final at ANZ Stadium.
 The Rabbitohs are fresh from a 60-8 mauling of Sydney Roosters, orchestrated by Walker's white-hot form.
 It's the opposite lead-in for the Knights, who were thumped 36-6 by the Titans.
 However, Walker knows better than to discount a side because of their recent form given Souths were handed a lesson from Canterbury the week before.
 "We haven't been as consistent as we'd like, we've just got to start fast," Walker said of Sunday's match.
 "We understand Knights are going to come out firing, with a lot of aggression, and we've just got to play our style of footy that we know we're capable of and the results will take care of itself."

 It said an investigation established that Rodriguez, who has no ranking, had acted as a courtsider at an ITF tournament held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in July 2019. Court-siding is a prohibited practice which involves transmission of live scoring data from a match to a third party for betting purposes.
 Rodriquez was also found to have placed 75 online bets on tennis matches during June 2019.
 The integrity unit said he also failed to “engage or provide any form of co- operation” during its investigation.
