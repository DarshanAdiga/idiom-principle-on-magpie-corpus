ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s coast guard says a rescue operation was launched overnight after a yacht carrying more than 150 migrants was found in distress in bad weather northeast of the Aegean island of Amorgos. The coast guard said Wednesday a nearby cargo ship picked up 151 people from the yacht during the search and rescue operation Tuesday evening, in which coast guard and Greek navy vessels also participated. The coast guard says a witness on board the Antigua and Barbuda-flagged cargo ship said they saw one person swimming away from the yacht, but gale force winds in the area were hampering any further search and rescue operations Wednesday morning.

According to court documents, Zeimet and Schroeder were among those attempting to arrest Edwards, 22, at about 7 a.m. June 15, 2019, in Maquoketa for an assault earlier in the day.


  According to Ostergren, law enforcement spent more than 10 minutes trying to talk Edwards into cooperating.


  A letter from Ostergen states that Zeimet and Schroeder were aware that Edwards “had a history of fighting with law enforcement when he was under the influence of controlled substances” and that he “appeared to be impaired.”


  When law enforcement went to apprehend Edwards, he ran. He was shot with a stun gun twice, “but it had no substantial effect,” according to the county attorney’s letter.


  A struggle ensued, and after Edwards was subdued, officers noticed he had stopped breathing.


  In the lawsuit, the family argued that Zeimet’s and Schroeder’s use of stun guns exacerbated a heart condition and led to his death.


  The family argued that authorities knew of the heart condition, as he had to be hospitalized on two earlier occasions in which stun guns were used.


  A spokesperson for the law office of Dave O’Brien, the attorney representing the family, told the Telegraph Herald last week that the family of Edwards also would receive a $500,000 settlement from the county, but so far no such agreement has been finalized, said County Supervisor Mike Steines.


  “We are still in litigation, and I haven’t heard anything from our attorney,” he said. “I know the attorney for the Edwards’ side has said a few things. We don’t have anything on our agenda yet.”

“Plus we do have the produce market going this time of year, with mums, corn, tomatoes, so there’s an opportunity to get fresh produce as well,” Gritt said.


  Fun farm


  With sunflowers in full bloom, pumpkins are waiting in the wings for their turn — just around the corner.


  The annual Gritt’s Fun Farm including corn mazes, hay rides, giant slides and more, will open Sept. 26 with most attractions up and running — and a few changes in store to keep guests and staff safe.


  “The farm in total is about 300 acres, and usable land for the fun farm, we’re probably close to 40-plus acres of outdoor space. And then you add in the greenhouses and all the area around and it’s almost 50 acres, so there’s definitely an opportunity to social distance,” Gritt said.


  “Certain things like the wagon rides, we are gong to require face masks on those, and cut the number of people to about 50 percent of what we typically run.”


  The pumpkin patch is extensive and the corn mazes are large as well — about 12 acres combined. Masks won’t be required in those areas, but will be expected in food service stations and anywhere else people might congregate outside of their family groups.


  “We actually just got 300 gallons of hand sanitizer in. I’m hoping that’ll last throughout the whole season but I’m not sure,” Gritt said.


  “We’ll have about 25 hand sanitizing stations set up throughout the farm. We’re going to ask for people to just be conscious of it and sanitize before and after getting on and off the wagon. And there will be hand sanitizing stations at the slides. Anytime they’re gonna touch something, we’d like for them to do that, for their safety as well as everyone else’s.”


  New this year, in response to COVID-19, the farm will sell tickets online only with a limited number for time slots from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.


  An added benefit of the online system?


  “We’ll have a running log of who was here, so if there’s a case of COVID that pops up, we can notify everybody,” Gritt said.

Ending the summer in style! Ivanka Trump gets dressed to the nines to pose for a sweet family photo with her three children


--DocBreak--
DENNIS -- General manager John Terrio Jr. and his staff at Chapin's Bayside have taken to calling this the "Summer of Survival."
 The restaurant next to Mayflower Beach was busy this summer, Terrio said, despite the coronavirus pandemic and the rules imposed by the Baker administration that caused it to shift from air-conditioned dining rooms to a tent in a parking lot behind the restaurant. Customers, wary of warnings about COVID-19 transmission indoors, wanted to be outside even during the region's insufferable August heat waves.
 "We were very fortunate there was not a lot of rain this summer," Terrio said.
 The dip in customers during last week's rain and fall-like temperatures showed him how critical good weather was to outdoor dining, and he prayed for a return to summer conditions through autumn to add much-needed revenue.
 "With a year like this, we don't want to leave anything on the table," he said. "I'm trying to make sure our staff has money in their pocket to survive (the winter). We can't afford to lose them, because they are the backbone."
 In the spring, people will put up with cold and clouds to dine outside in 50-degree weather, because it's comparably warmer than winter, said Janet Demetri, who has owned the Friendly Fisherman in North Eastham for 31 years. The restaurant offers only outdoor dining, and Demetri said the same hardiness does not apply to late summer and fall.
 "September with 55 degrees, no one will sit outside," she said.
 In New England, it is notoriously difficult to predict the weather. The one- month outlook for the Northeast is a crapshoot, with an equal chance of above, below or normal temperatures and precipitation, according to the National Climate Center. The three-month forecast is for a 60% to 70% chance of above- normal temperatures and a coin toss on precipitation.
 "People want to dine outside, and people will cancel when the weather is not conducive," said Peter Troutman, co-owner of the Scargo Cafe in Dennis. "I expect when the weather changes, we will see a downturn in business."
 The weather and tourist income this summer kept the wolf from the door for many Cape restaurants that adapted to the new reality.
 "We do believe that business on Cape Cod and the Islands has been stronger than in Boston and other areas of the state ... but no one is killing it," said Robert Luz, executive director of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association.
 Cape Cod Commission Executive Director Kristy Senatori said that in an ongoing survey of the business community 86% of Cape businesses, represented by 371 respondents, said they relied on people coming into their establishments. Fifty-five percent of businesses reported being open in a limited capacity, and 8% said they did not reopen at all this summer.
 Although Luz did not have numbers broken out by region, the outlook is bleak for the restaurant industry as a whole. His data shows that 23% of restaurants statewide did not reopen when Gov. Charlie Baker allowed outdoor dining only at the beginning of June and limited indoor dining a couple of weeks later. Luz anticipates that a muted -- and in places like Boston, a disastrous -- summer will be the final blow for an estimated 3,400 restaurants of the 16,000 that were open statewide March 1.
 "We're hoping that by next summer there is a change because of a vaccine, herd immunity, the virus dying out naturally," said Scargo Cafe co-owner David Troutman. "Sadly, I think there will be a lot less competition next spring after a number of (restaurant) failures."
 The well-known Japanese restaurant Inaho in Yarmouth Port is not contemplating closure, co-owner Alda Watanabe said. But navigating the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape has not been easy, even with 35 years of experience.
 "When we first opened (the restaurant at its current site), it was a challenge," Watanabe said. "But this is more; every day is a challenge."
 Watanabe and her husband, chef Yuji Watanabe, reopened in June with only takeout. Later in the season they decided to resume indoor dining at 50% capacity with plexiglass panels between tables, but the cozy confines of a historical Cape-style building worked against them. Even regular customers were concerned.
 "We saw old faces come in once, and wouldn't see them again. People felt unsafe," she said.
 The Watanabes also were concerned about the safety and health of their staff, and they reverted to takeout only.
 Terrio, Watanabe and the Troutmans said the stress of handling a robust takeout service alongside on-premises dining took its toll on workers. Like many other restaurants, Chapin's suffered from low staffing, due in part to cuts to student work visa and temporary work visa programs by the Trump administration, and to the federal $600 boost to unemployment payments that many restaurants said kept some local workers on the sidelines. Alda Watanabe said she saw valuable staff members, concerned about their safety and the future of the industry, leave to pursue other careers.
 "In a pandemic, people eat cake," quipped Olive Chase, owner of the Casual Gourmet in Centerville, noting one trend at her small restaurant -- another being that people have shunned indoor seats for the outdoor tables all summer.
 "(Fall business) is vital, especially when you lost the spring and summer," Chase said. Casual Gourmet operates an outdoor cafe at the Heritage Museums & Gardens in Sandwich, where the season can extend into the winter, and finds that people have become more tolerant of less-than-ideal dining conditions. She thinks diners will put on a jacket for fall dining, especially if portable heaters or a fireplace or firepit are present.
 But most of her business is catering, for weddings and other large functions. That side of the business pretty much dried up after Baker rolled back the maximum outdoor guest total from 100 to 50 people in response to an increased number of large private parties and an uptick in cases.
 "We had three or four weddings go to 2021 and had a bunch who had to uninvite guests," Chase said.
 Even more important entering the winter season is the maximum of 25 people now allowed at indoor venues regardless of the building size.
 On Aug. 28, the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce spearheaded a delegation of Cape restaurant owners in appealing to state Housing and Economic Development Secretary Michael Kennealy for help in restoring the outdoor maximum to 100. The logic was that there was evidence the reduction actually caused larger gatherings to go underground, relocating to private homes where there was little of the oversight that a licensed restaurant or caterer would impose.
 Luz said the state and the Baker administration are very concerned about the restaurant industry and industry aid packages are under consideration from federal and state sources.
 "It doesn't get reported enough, but Governor Baker has gone out of his way to say that restaurants are not the problem," Luz said. "The clusters we see are private parties and unsanctioned events."
 Luz believes that as long as Massachusetts retains its low positive test rate of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and other signals that the virus is under control, diners will return to indoor dining this winter.
 "I think guests will come back inside and they should be confident these restaurants have gone out of their way to be safe," he said.
 Luz even thinks bars could make a case for reopening by closing dance floors, putting in tables and serving food.
 "This industry can manage it all, from food trucks to food courts and full- service restaurants and catered events, even bars," Luz said.
 Alda Watanabe said Inaho may try reopening indoor dining again after summer crowds have died down. The stress has made them consider the inevitable.
 "We've been in the business for 35 years and we have to look at winding it down," she said. "We're not there yet, we're still hopeful."

Passenger Information Systems are one of the most important elements of contemporary public transport. They significantly increase the travelling comfort for passengers, enabling them to obtain information needed to feel comfortable while travelling. The information for passengers is displayed both on-board, at railway stations, hubs, stops and on platforms. It is mainly shown by electronic information displays of various types and dimensions and audio information devices, which are controlled by specialized devices (auto computers) or directly by computers (stationary solutions) that are based on information obtained from the relevant databases. Visual information in vehicles is provided by electronic direction boards installed in the front of vehicles, on their sides, in the rear and inside. Depending on the needed resolution and the available installation place, displays with different dimensions are used.

Tesla has been one of the brightest examples of Big Tech’s wild movements, and it surged 74.1% in August alone. It slumped 21.1% Tuesday, its worst loss since it began trading a decade ago, amid disappointment that it won’t be joining the S&P 500 anytime soon.


  The company behind the S&P 500 announced the inclusion of several companies in the benchmark index, including Etsy. Some investors thought Tesla would be among them, which can create huge bouts of buying as index funds automatically fold the stock into their portfolios.


  The big question for the stock market is whether the losses can stay mostly confined to the tech area, which had been soaring so quickly earlier and looked to be the most expensive part of the market.


  “How resilient can the stocks beneath the surface be?” said Delwiche. “If they hold up, that would fit with a healthy correction,” which is what traders call a drop of 10% for the market and can mark a short-term breather for stocks in the midst of an upward run.


  “If they don’t, then it could be something more significant.”


  Beyond the tech stock slump, other worries are also hanging over the stock market, which had been setting record highs just last week.


  Pessimism is rising that Democrats and Republicans in Washington will be able to find a deal to send more aid to unemployed workers and an economy still struggling amid the pandemic. Investors have been largely assuming that a deal would eventually pass, but recent talks between government leaders have yielded no progress.


  President Donald Trump is also talking about “decoupling” the U.S. economy from China, as the presidential campaign heats up. The relationship between the world’s two largest economies has been on edge for years, and all the uncertainty threatens to exacerbate the global economy’s already shaky standing.


  Energy stocks had some of Wall Street’s sharpest drops as the price of oil tumbled. Apache lost 10.7%, and Diamondback Energy fell 10% after benchmark U.S. crude sank $3.01 to $36.76 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $2.23 to $39.78.


  But the market’s losses were widespread, with nearly 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 lower.


  Among the few gainers was General Motors. It rose 7.9% after it said it’s taking an ownership stake in electric-vehicle company Nikola, which itself surged 40.8%.

MACKINAW CITY -- Most coaches and players would be satisfied with a conference runner-up finish.
   
 Not Mackinaw City varsity volleyball coach Rachel Grooters and her players.
   
 After so many close calls in the past, they want to finish the deal this time around.
   
 That means winning the Northern Lakes Conference.
   
 "Our main goal is always to have fun and add some hardware to our trophy case," said Grooters, who is in her fourth season back with the Comets. "We would love to take first in the conference. We've had enough second places. Other goals would be to do well in tournament play and then put up a good fight at districts."
   
 Following a 13-9, 13-3 NLC record last campaign, the Comets will return a plethora of players hungry to win titles this fall.
   
 Leading the way is junior Raeann Hingston, one of the more powerful outside hitters on the squad.
   
 "She's aggressive, works hard and will be a great leader this year," Grooters said of Hingston.
   
 Two other key seniors include inside hitter/backup setter Ella House and middle/outside hitter Carissa Sroka.
   
 "(House) is another hard worker with a positive attitude and a love for the sport," Grooters said. (Sroka has) got the height, a strong serve and the attitude needed for one of my net players."
   
 A nice addition to the squad will be sophomore Madison Smith, who will play in the middle.
   
 "She's tall, aggressive, has a strong serve and amazing attack and an overall competitive player," Grooters said of Smith.
   
 Sophomore setter Marlie Postula will play an important role as a setter, while fellow sophomore Larissa Huffman is an outside/middle hitter.
   
 "She's got a nice set, she can think on her feet and adapt to any situation. Shes a strong and aggressive player," Grooters said of Postula. "(Huffman is) another competitive athlete on the team. She's got a great pass, plays well at the net and is a player that I can put anywhere. She is another player that can adjust to any situation she is put into."
   
 With things now underway, Grooters can't wait see what unfolds with her squad in what should be an intriguing campaign.
   
 "This year's team is a group of competitive girls. They all have a love for the game and winning," Grooters said. "They already have a great team bond and I'm excited to see where the season takes us. I don't foresee any challenge right now. If they continue to work as hard as they have been, it should be a great season."
   
 Mackinaw City has started the season with a 3-1 record.

MOUNT GAY — Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College welcomed members of the Higher Learning Commission to its Logan campus for a Focused Visit in March, as a follow-up to Southern’s 2018 Peer Review Team visit, which outlined several areas of concern.


  The HLC’s Institutional Actions Council has recommended that, based on evidence provided by the college in response to these concerns, Southern receive continued accreditation with an embedded report within the 2022-23 comprehensive evaluation. Final action will be taken by the Higher Learning Commission Board of Trustees during their meeting Nov. 5-6.


  “I am thrilled with the outcome of the report,” Pamela L. Alderman, Southern’s president, said. “The final team we put together to present our evidence did a wonderful job. Everyone at the college pulled together, working extremely hard to collect the information and submit the evidence in a timely manner. The recommendation from the IAC Hearing Committee and comments within the report is validation we are moving in the right direction.”


  Southern is accredited by and in good standing with the HLC. Southern was first accredited in 1971 and has had continuous accreditation since that time. The HLC accredits colleges and universities in a 19-state region of the United States.

China then accused the U.S. of sowing discord in the strategic region and last month, its military reportedly test-fired two missiles in the South China Sea during exercises.


  China has pushed for the resumption of negotiations with ASEAN on a code of conduct aimed at preventing armed clashes in the disputed waters. But Hoang Thi Ha of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore said major differences between China and rival claimant states would stymie any breakthrough or an early agreement.


  “Given the recent developments both on the lawfare front and tensions at sea, I don’t see much silver lining,” she told The Associated Press.


  Pompeo and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, have confirmed their attendance at the ASEAN Regional Forum on Saturday, Asia’s largest security forum, which will also be done by video. North Korea’s foreign minister will skip the forum but its representative to ASEAN will participate, according to Vietnam’s foreign ministry.

BUFFALO – Sure, you could grow your own field of sunflowers.


  Water them, weed them, add in fertilizer and shoo the deer away — all for the glory of a brilliant burst of color that heralds in the coming season and lasts but a few short weeks.


  Or you could head out to Gritt’s Farm where they’ve got a field full of blooms ready for pictures and picking.


  “We’ll have some props set out in the field for photo opportunities and we’ll let people go out and cut stems if they’d like to take any home with them,” said Brad Gritt, the farm’s general manager.


  “Like a pick-your-own field. They just kind of enjoy it. We let them come out and walk through the field, take pictures, cut them if they’d like. A lot of it’s based around photos.”


  It’s the second year Gritt’s has offered its field of flowers, the result of a gap between summer produce and fall crops.


  “We’re always looking for new opportunities to get people out and about. A bunch of farms like us around the country have been doing sunflowers, so we were like, ‘Let’s do that.’ Because pumpkins aren’t quite ready yet and we were looking for something to extend our season,” Gritt said.


  Season’s wonders


  Technically, sunflowers can grow up to 12 feet in height, though most of those at the farm are under 6 feet. They face the sky to attract the bees when it’s time for pollination and droop toward the ground as their seeds mature — a move that protects them from predatory birds and rain.


  And here’s another fun fact.


  Look closely at the head of a sunflower: each one is made up of hundreds — sometimes thousands — of tiny, individual flowers held together by a single base.


  So if you take roughly 5,000 sunflowers per acre, multiply that by the five acres full of them at Gritt’s and multiply that number by, say conservatively, 500 tiny flowers per head, you end up with ... a whole bunch of blossoms.


  Next weekend, September 12 and 13, should be prime bloom.

HONG KONG — China has launched an initiative to address global data security issues, a countermove to the U.S. “clean network” program that is aimed at discouraging other countries from using Chinese technology.


  Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the initiative in Beijing on Tuesday at a seminar on global digital governance.


  He said mounting risks for cyber security threaten national security, public interests and personal rights.


  The move comes amid a deterioration in U.S.-China relations encompassing trade tensions and competition in telecommunications and artificial intelligence technologies, with the U.S. accusing Chinese technology companies of threatening American national security.


  “Bent on unilateral acts, a certain country keeps making groundless accusations against others in the name of ‘clean’ networks and used security as a pretext to prey on enterprises of other countries who have a competitive edge,” Wang said, according to a transcript of his speech released by the ministry. “Such blatant acts of bullying must be opposed and rejected.”


  Wang said that it was important to develop international rules on data security that will “reflect the will and respect the interests of all countries through broad-based participation.”


  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month unveiled the “Clean Network” program, saying it is aimed at protecting citizens’ privacy and sensitive information from “malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party.”


  More than 30 countries and territories such as Australia and Britain are participating in that initiative, which seeks to exclude Chinese telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE, as well as apps, cloud service providers and undersea cables from their internet networks.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Republican Gov. Chris Sununu easily defeated two longshot primary challengers to secure his spot on the November ballot, but the race between Democrats Dan Feltes and Andru Volinsky is too early to call. With almost 91% of the precincts reporting by early Wednesday morning, Feltes led Volinsky by just under 4,000 votes out of more than 130,000 votes counted. While Volinsky hadn’t conceded, Feltes claimed victory late Tuesday night, vowing to prove the pundits wrong and defeat Sununu. Sununu, seeking a third term, defeated conservative activist Karen Testerman and a Keene man who had changed his name to “Nobody.”

Anton Markovtzev, 20, was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after allegedly hurling a brick at a cop car outside Day St police station.At the same time police at the station had been investigating a vandalism spree in the city last week, which they now allege Mr Markovtzev was responsible for.He has been charged with seven counts of recklessly destroying or damaging property less than $2000.That includes allegedly scrawling in multi-coloured tags the words “Tit 4 Tat” and “Vape Don’t Rape” on the base of the Queen Victoria statue, outside the QVB, at about 3.50pm last Wednesday, September 2. It is alleged those words, plus another idiom “Tasers Not Lasers”, were also painted on the Service NSW building at Haymarket on the same day.Graffiti also popped up on an underpass at Eddy Ave, on a NSW Government building on Pitt St – which read “Tasers Not Lasers For Victim Blamers” – while a fully marked police car was tagged with “Tape the Cops”.Mr Markovtzev, from Castle Hill, was released on bail at Central Local Court on Wednesday after agreeing to not possess spray paint, markers of bricks in public, and stay at least 5km from the CBD.He appeared on screen from the cells at Surry Hills police station, with stringy dark hair and wearing a black T-shirt, appearing amused as he rested his chin on his handcuffed hands. His Legal Aid lawyer told the court her client had made full admissions to police about the alleged offences, and the reason why he carried out the acts.“I’m instructed he’s frustrated at not having employment at the moment,” she said.Earlier she described the incident as a “belated act of teenage behaviour”, and noted he had already spent almost 24 hours behind bars.Mr Markovtzev piped up when Magistrate Robert Williams asked if mental health was a factor.“I’ve been diagnosed with autism,” the 20-year-old told the court, adding he was seeing a doctor near his northwest Sydney home.Police prosecutor Sergeant Saeed Geha had opposed bail but asked if he was released that Mr Markovtzev be banned from the city.Magistrate Williams imposed that condition on granting bail, and ordered the man’s parents to forfeit $500 if he broke any of his conditions.The matter was adjourned to the Downing Centre on September 15, where pleas are expected to be entered.

SOMERSET -- Haylie Schwarzenbach has chosen Somerset over Hawaii.
 What?
 A senior marine biology major at the Hawaii Pacific University in Honolulu, Schwarzenbach has a rational reason for SouthCoast over Waikiki Beach: concern over the coronavirus infection rate in Hawaii. She'll be taking her fall semester courses online and, in her spare time, the Joseph Case High School graduate wants to help area pre-K through 12 students negotiate the world of online learning.
 Very much aware of the struggles so many students have with online learning, she's decided to go into business as a tutor.
 The eldest of five children, the youngest of whom is at the day care/pre-K level, Schwarzenbach has witnessed from point-blank range the challenges involved with virtual learning. "I can see my sisters struggling with adapting to this new learning style, and I know so many families have similar concerns," she said in a Facebook message. "Throughout this pandemic you can see posts on multiple platforms (mostly Facebook) of parents voicing these concerns."
 And Facebook searches can find more and more people offering to help. The At Home Schooling Support in Southeastern Mass Facebook page, for example, features not only advice, but also teachers and college students who are available to work with students. The trend for helping students with virtual learning is a two-way street. Families, sometimes working in unison with other families, are actively seeking teachers to help their children make online learning work.
 Adrienne Machado, of Somerset, with her child about to start kindergarten, is aiming to create an educational pod, for her daughter and other kindergarten students at the North Elementary School. She's offering space at her house for a classroom, adding that if other families also have space, the pod could alternate locations. The focus is to help the young children with their remote learning.
 Last spring, once schools went to remote learning, she saw how her then pre-K daughter dealt with school on a computer screen. She and her husband both work full-time and they have a younger daughter. There wasn't always time to babysit their older daughter at the computer.
 "Needless to say, it was not very successful for my daughter," Machado said. "When we would walk away, she would close the computer and walk away."
 At the time of this interview last week, Machado said her quest to form a learning pod had not yet gotten much traction. She didn't yet know who her daughter's in-school cohorts would be. The Machados are still new to the school system so networking isn't easy. She did know nor the who, what, when and where of the remote learning and was. She was basically waiting for the plans so she can frame the house. "It's almost impossible to set this up now," she said.
 She was informed by the school soon after the interview who her daughter's teacher is and given times to meet with her.
 Machado said in a Facebook post that she has already spoken with elementary education majors at local colleges about leading pods. She envisions the parent group paying the teachers $20-$25 per hour. Any interested parents or potential pod teachers may contact her at amach718@gmail.com
 Schwarzenbach, who is looking at a career of open-ocean research of cetaceans and pinnipeds, is doing both undergraduate (marine biology) and graduate (marine science) school work for Hawaii Pacific this fall semester. Due to the six-hour time difference between here and Hawaii, her classes (held on Mondays and Wednesdays) take place at night, leaving her with daytime to tutor; she'll also babysit. Her previous tutoring experience was with science and ELA.
 She said she understands the immense challenge school teachers are facing in an online/hybrid world with students who learn in different ways. She said she embraces working with pre-K through 12.
 "High schoolers are closer to my own age and course material, and I've attended enough lectures and labs in my scholastic career that I am able to convey the material in a way they can understand," she said. "Tutoring for middle-schoolers is a little more challenging, in my opinion, because they're in such a big period of change as they are maturing. The teaching style for middle school is still really interactive and fun, and that is sometimes difficult to do online. Elementary school is still the youthful high energy, and the way material is conveyed is simplistic and fun."
 Schwarzenbach emphasized that a face mask is part of her standard equipment for both tutoring and babysitting and that she is willing to undergo periodic SARS-CoV-2 testing.
 She said he envisions charging $15-$18 per hour for her services but that families facing financial hardships can talk to her about the cost. Interested families may call or text her at 774-451-0199.
 "I really hope to help my greater community," Schwarzenbach said. "I grew up in a loving church family in Swansea since 2012, and know so many of the families there. My family relocated to Somerset a few years ago, where we have built great ties to the people and town here. I'd like to offer the help to these towns. If someone else however outside of this area needs help with this, I am happy to consider it."
