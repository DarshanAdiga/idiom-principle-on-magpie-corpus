I wrapped it in mousse and finished it with a mirror glaze,” explained Adam Schwed, a doctor from Layton, Utah, of his jaw-dropping Jell-O.

A Breakfast Crumble for Early Birds With a Sweet Tooth - The New York Times

The Angels placed shortstop Andrelton Simmons on the 10-day injured list Tuesday because of a left-ankle sprain. Infielder Luis Rengifo was recalled from the team’s alternate training site in Long Beach.
 Simmons twisted his ankle on the back of the first-base bag while lunging to beat out an infield single in the ninth inning of Monday’s 3-0 loss at Oakland.
 Though the defensive whiz will be sidelined for at least 10 days — a significant blow for the team in a pandemic-shortened 60-game season — the Angels are confident the injury won’t require an extended stay on the IL.
 “I actually walked out with him after [Monday’s game], and you could tell it was bothering him, but he was still very optimistic. You know, ‘I’ll be alright, give me a couple days,’ that kind of conversation,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Something strange is showing up on doorsteps across the state and agriculture officials want to get to the bottom of it.Packages marked as jewelry from China are being delivered to residents, but inside is just a package of seeds.seeds in mailState officials say residents in 15 counties have reported getting the strange packages containing seeds in the mail. They also say the seeds could be a threat to our state agriculture industry.State Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson said, “One of these seeds containing a fungus could decimate our sweet potato crop. We don’t want it going in the ground.”So why is it happening?State officials say it’s a ploy by overseas e-commerce companies, trying to boost sales.Gipson says the companies ship the packages for free then go and write a favorable review of their own product, using the name of the person they shipped the package to.Some of the packages are marked ring, or necklace on the front.A Simpson County woman tells 3 on your side she got not one, but two seed packages in the mail, several weeks apart.Some of the seeds have been tested and were from watermelons, gourds and Cogan grass a common weed in our state.If you gets the seeds, officials at the Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry will come and collect them from you. They can be contacted at 662-325-3390.They also ask that you do not throw the packages away, and keep the packaging for their investigation.Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

It wasn’t quite the record-setting 6-under-par that Williams fired on the final day a year ago, but it was solid and just what he needed to begin the week.
 “I didn’t do many very things poorly today, which is nice,” Williams said. “My mental process was awesome and I hit a lot of the right shots, made a lot of par putts — I’m very happy with my score.”
 For Reale, this week marks a year since a mid-range putt slipped just past the cup on the 72nd hole of the 100th West Virginia Amateur.
 That putt would’ve given him a birdie and the win, but the resulting par put him in a three-man playoff with Williams eventually coming through as the winner.
 “Hand to God, I honestly had nightmares for a week about that last putt that didn’t go in,” Reale admitted. “So we’re going to try to shoot one shot better this year.”
 This time around, Reale completed that birdie on the 18th and was quite happy with his round of 2-under 68, with his preference of the two courses — the Old White TPC — on deck for Wednesday.
 “This golf course has been my Achilles heel since they opened up the new design,” Reale said. “Traditionally I play the Old White better and my comfort zone is there, so I’m hoping this is the start of something good.”
 The Old White is a longer golf course that could prove problematic for shorter hitters.
 That would include two-time winner Steve Fox of Huntington, who came in with a 1-under 69 as part of the morning wave.
 Fox, who won the tournament in 1988 and 1994, said his goal entering the week was just to make the cut. He took a good step toward that on Tuesday.
 “Just grinded it out,” Fox said. “I’m almost 67 so I’m fortunate to be here, happy to be here and ultimately my goal was to make the cut and play four days. Very pleased with today.
 “Meadows is much more suitable for my game,” Fox added. “I played the Old White [Monday] and hit 10 hybrids. It’s just too difficult for me, but you just have to grind it out, make putts and do the best you can.”

SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) — With the 2020-21 school year rapidly approaching, a Shreveport pediatric specialist is making it very clear that “it’s up to us” to reduce spread of the coronavirus before returning to the classroom.Dr. Joseph Bocchini, whose focus is on pediatric infectious diseases with Willis-Knighton Health System, spoke with KSLA News 12′s Christian Piekos about what parents should really understand before sending their children back to school.The Louisiana Department of Health reports that the state has had 1,125 new coronavirus cases since Monday, the lowest case count since early July. Hospitalizations also have declined.“I think the main concern for me is getting this virus under control before the school year starts,” Bocchini stated. “We still have three plus weeks to try and get better control of this virus.”The doctor believes it is paramount for citizens to continue wearing face masks, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings.This vital guidance comes as Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards announced during a news conference Tuesday that the state ranked number one COVID-19 cases per capita in the United States.“I think it’s certainly understandable to have some degree of apprehension,” Bocchini said. “We’ve certainly not learned everything about this virus. And we really don’t have a lot of experience with children in school during the circulation of this virus.”Even as school districts throughout the ArkLaTex lay out their plans to keep students and faculty members safe, some parents remain on edge about how protected their child will be.“I think what we need to be thinking about is what’s in the best interest of children and what is needed to reduce the likelihood a child will become infected by going back to school,” Bocchini said.School districts have given parents the option of total virtual learning for their kids, including a hybrid model, which allows for split time at home and in the classroom. Of course, some districts will welcome children back full time.Regardless, school districts everywhere are stressing the importance of being cognizant of symptoms daily, wearing masks and minimizing physical contact with others.“The things schools have done to enable students to be in the classroom in a safer environment ... doing things to minimize the kind of contact that might occur ... will all help reduce the likelihood of a child getting exposed,” Bocchini said.With so many parents acutely aware of students’ well-being, some also are questioning when the appropriate time is to seek medical attention if a child is presenting symptoms similar to COVID-19.Bocchini believes it’s situational.“I think a parent has to look at what’s being done and then the parents have to consider, ‘Does my child have any risk factors that would increase the likelihood that they might have a severe case of COVID,” Bocchini explained. “If there’s a high degree of spread within the community, I might want that child who has a fever with respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms to be seen by their pediatrician or primary care physician.”KSLA News 12 also asked Bocchini whether he would send his children back to the classroom right now, given the serious nature of the coronavirus in Louisiana.“I think I would like to see us do better over the next few weeks in reducing the spread of the virus within the community. I would like to see us reach a point where we see significant drop in hospitalizations and the number of positive cases,” Bocchini responded.“Then I’ll feel a lot more comfortable about having children go to school.”Bocchini also wants parents to help ease anxious students’ fears by reminding them of the importance of wearing a mask, keeping a solid distance from others and the serious safety measures being taken by schools each day to keep them safe.Copyright 2020 KSLA.

Once the wasps were thinned out, the hummingbird feeder went back up, just in time for the annual migration of the Rufous hummingbirds. This is always an exciting time for Peter.
 The Rufous is not a nice hummingbird — and I don't think hummingbirds are nice to begin with.
 "If hummingbirds were 10 times bigger, we would hate them!" I tell Peter. He can't disagree. From my highly unscientific observations, I would estimate that hummingbirds spend one-tenth of their time eating and the other nine- tenths trying to prevent other hummingbirds from eating.
 The Rufous is even worse. The Rufous is marginally bigger than the other hummingbirds so, when they move in, they act like the Jets in "West Side Story" — except they don't even get along with one another. The Rufous snaps open its tailfeathers like a switchblade to scare the other birds away.
 "I'm a big, bad bird!" the Rufous says, fanning its orange tail and looking tough. No one seems to get any eating done. It's just a lot of posturing and fighting.
 "Hummingbirds are dumb!" I tell Peter.
 "Yeah, but they're beautiful!" Peter says, looking at their shiny feathers and delicate beaks.
 We have a long wire strung from our neighbors' shed to our house that we hang lights from. I would estimate there is room for 3,000 hummingbirds on that strand of wire but, according to hummingbird logic, more than one hummingbird on the line at a time is a crowd. They fight like mad for one particular spot on the wire while the rest of the space sits vacant.

WESLACO -- As recovery and cleanup efforts got underway Monday in South Texas in the wake of a downgraded Hanna, worried residents confronted the prospect of undertaking the effort amid a surge in coronavirus cases that has left many fearful about their health.
   
 Now a tropical depression, Hanna was 65 miles north of Fresnillo in the Mexican state of Zacatecas as its winds weakened to about 25 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Its remnants still threatened to bring rainfall and flash flooding to waterlogged parts of South Texas and northern Mexico.
   
 For 66-year-old Nora Esquivel, who has mostly stayed in her home in Weslaco, in Hidalgo County, since March because of the pandemic, flooding damage to her home from Hanna meant a greater chance of exposure to the virus.
   
 "No contact with nobody, only my daughter once in a while, and now with this, I have to allow people to come into my house, the insurance and all this, and I'm scared," said a tearful Esquivel, who takes heart medication and had to be rescued from her home Sunday morning by her son in a kayak.
   
 "All my friends are dying. ... I have fear for my family, for everybody, not just me, and this is the whole world."
   
 In the aftermath of Hanna, which dumped up to 16 inches of rain in some parts of South Texas and northern Mexico, officials reported two people died in the northern Mexican city of Ramos Arispe, near Monterrey, after torrents of water unleashed by Hanna swept their vehicle away. Three people were reported missing in Monterrey, and three more were missing in the border city of Reynosa, across from McAllen, according to Mexico's national civil defense office.
   
 Gov. Greg Abbott said the state was sending additional testing supplies and hospital personnel to South Texas communities affected by Hanna to ensure that the storm doesn't exacerbate the spread of the virus.
   
 "The spread of COVID can be far more deadly than the damage caused by the storm," Abbott said on KRGV-TV. He planned to tour damaged areas on Tuesday.
   
 The governor asked residents to adhere to social distancing guidelines and to wear masks if they had to leave their homes and go to a shelter. Officials said shelters were set up to be as safe as possible, with temperature checks by on-site medical personnel. Some were being sheltered in hotel rooms.
   
 Border communities hit by Hanna were already strained by COVID-19 cases, with some patients being airlifted to larger cities.
   
 In Cameron County, next to Hidalgo County, officials said they were grateful the hurricane did not overwhelm their hospitals, which continue dealing with a crush of COVID-19 patients.
   
 Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño Jr., the county's top elected official, said there were reports of at least 150 flooded homes and some roads were still impassable due to high water, but for the most part the county was doing well.
   
 "I think we're very fortunate the storm did not bring major, major flooding, and no loss of life," he said.
   
 But Cameron County officials remained concerned about the pandemic, as cases in the past week have increased by 2,587 -- more than the total from mid-March to July 1. The county has more than 7,800 cases. Deaths have increased by 81 in the past week, Treviño said. A week ago, the county had 96 deaths.
   
 North of Cameron County in Nueces County, Corpus Christi reported that 60 infants tested positive for COVID-19 from July 1 to July 16.
   
 Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus, and Hanna was the first big test.
   
 More than 65,400 customers remained without power Monday throughout South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and McAllen, utility officials said. That was down from a peak of 200,000 early Sunday morning.
   
 In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, a maternity hospital was damaged by heavy rain, with some patients moved to upper floors and others evacuated to other facilities, said Pedro Granados, director of civil protection for Tamaulipas state.
   
 In the Mexican city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, the rains shook tents in a refugee camp housing an estimated 1,300 asylum seekers, including newborns and elderly people, who have been waiting for months for court dates under a U.S. immigration policy informally known as "Remain in Mexico."
   
 Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved an emergency declaration that will provide federal aid.
   
 Hanna blew ashore as a Category 1 storm late Saturday afternoon with winds of 90 mph not far from Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.
   
 Hanna came nearly three years after Hurricane Harvey made landfall northeast of Corpus Christi, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.
   
 Associated Press writer Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report.

The bill would offer up to nine months of assistance to child care providers so they know they can remain in business, Reed said. Parents have to know they will have safe childcare available when they go back to work.
 Reed said up to $15 billion would be available to child care operators nationwide under the bill that seeks to provide a safe environment for children’s return.
 Reed said he liked the fact Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dropped a bill, which he described as “moving in a positive direction.”
 There’s no money in the GOP bill for state and local governments.
 “I’m still very confident we’ll be able to get this taken care of,” Reed told reporters on his weekly press call. “It might bleed over into next week.”
 Reed said he would favor a $1.5 trillion package, half of the HEROES bill passed by Democrats, but containing $500 billion for state and local governments. “That’s a lot of money.”
 The Corning Republican said he felt “enough members on both sides of the aisle will need local and state aid to be in the bill to support it.”
 A compromise bill will get 60-70 votes in the Senate and 218 Democratic votes in the House, Reed predicted.
 The expiration of bonus unemployment will place leverage on the Senate and House to reach a compromise. “They wait until the last minute and run everything up to the edge of the cliff,” he said. “I wish they wouldn’t do it.”
