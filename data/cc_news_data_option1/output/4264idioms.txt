The median selling price of a home also climbed to $311,800, up 15% from a year earlier, according to NAR. This is largely because of low inventory of existing homes. Housing inventory fell to only 2.7 months of home inventory on the market. That's a record low for that metric since NAR started tracking that data in 1982. Homes are moving off the market quickly as well, due to the lack of inventory, with a median home on the market only 21 days.

Lowe hit two home runs to the opposite field, Tampa Bay's bullpen held on late and the Rays beat Los Angeles 6-4 on Wednesday night.
 “Yeah, those felt really good,” said Lowe, a 2019 All-Star who led the Rays with 14 homers and 37 RBIs this season. “It felt great to kind of get back and contribute to the team. They've been doing so well for the past month — it felt really good to get back and actually start doing stuff again.”
 Blake Snell struck out nine in 4 2/3 innings for the Rays and didn't allow a hit until Chris Taylor's two-run homer trimmed it to 5-2 in the fifth. The Dodgers threatened to complete a big comeback in the eighth, but Tampa Bay's relievers held firm.
 Lowe and Joey Wendle each had three RBIs for the Rays, whose six runs and 10 hits were their most over the past 11 postseason games.
 “I think today was a little bit better indicator of the kind of team that we are,” said Wendle, who had a two-run double and a sacrifice fly. “Just a complete win, complete team win.“
 Nick Anderson got four outs for the victory. Diego Castillo earned the save when he struck out Taylor, the only batter he faced.
 Pete Fairbanks went 1 2/3 innings and left-hander Aaron Loup threw a called third strike past slugger Cody Bellinger with a runner on second to end the eighth. Loup also retired the first two hitters in the ninth.
 “They've got some really good pitchers. They got out to that early lead and we just weren't able to overcome it,” Taylor said. “We did a pretty good job of fighting to the end and we just weren't able to come up with the big hit we needed.”
 After an off day, Game 3 in the best-of-seven Series matches two big-game pitchers starting on extra rest Friday night. Charlie Morton goes for the Rays against Walker Buehler.
 Los Angeles was the “home team” for the first two games but will bat first in the next three.
 Lowe hit a solo shot to left-center in the first off rookie Tony Gonsolin, putting the American League champion Rays ahead for the first time at this neutral-site World Series with their 27th homer of the postseason — matching a major league record. The second baseman was hitting .107 this postseason, and in an even worse 4-for-48 slide (.083) the past 13 games since the start of the AL Division Series.
 “You've got to able to be tough-minded and Brandon is. A lot of our guys are,“ Cash said. “We owe it to our guys to stick with them.
 “Brandon, go ahead and get hot now, feel good about yourself.”
 By the time Lowe went deep again in the fifth, his second opposite-field homer of the game — and the entire season — it was 5-0. That one bounced off the top of the left-field wall with a runner on against Dustin May, already the fourth Los Angeles pitcher.
 Will Smith and NLCS MVP Corey Seager also homered for the Dodgers. Seager's solo shot in the eighth was his seventh homer and 16th RBI, extending the franchise records he had already set this postseason. It's the most homers by a shortstop in any MLB postseason.

With a large number of Dartmouth’s professors belonging to a higher-risk category for COVID-19, teaching in person was a risk that many were unwilling to take. The College has also stipulated that if professors choose to offer an in-person section of a class, they must also offer a remote version of that same class or offer the class during every term of the academic year — a requirement that, while aimed at providing equity for students both on and off campus, would require a substantial amount of extra work for faculty members.

The show will go on for the 23 members of the Litchfield High School theater department who are staging “The Little Mermaid.”
 But along with receiving the traditional theatrical encouragement of “break a leg,” some might also be hoping to break the emotional hold COVID-19 has over them and their stagemates.
 “I really feel that this, this world for our kids, theater, has been a little normalcy in their unusual world right now,” director Sara Dollerschell said prior to rehearsal last week. “And it’s been great to have a routine to help stay on track.”
 There was some question about whether the traditional fall musical might happen this year, with pandemic restrictions and even the question about in what form school might take place. But LHS Activities Director Justin Brown encouraged Dollerschell to go ahead with the show. It was decided cast and crew could observe social distancing and take other precautions enough to make the show safe and worthwhile. And with the live show scheduled to be performed at Bernie Aaker Auditorium, they believed there might be fewer restrictions than at a school venue.
 As with everything COVID-19 related, things have changed since then. The show now will be performed before only small friends and family groups, who will attend by invitation only.
 “I have no regrets just going ahead and doing it,” Dollerschell said. “There are not many communities that are doing shows this fall. They’re postponing them ‘til spring, and I felt that we, I didn’t want to do that. Who knows that the spring will hold? So, I just thought, let’s keep it as normal as possible.”
 As normal as possible isn’t the same as an auditorium filled with friends, family and others. And that is disappointing, admit cast members, but they have taken an upbeat approach.
 Junior Greta Hulterstrum, who is in the lead role of Ariel – her first lead in eight different musicals — said she will miss the bigger crowd reactions that a normal show might get. But just to have a show in these times is a victory.
 “We have practice every day, and it gives you a sense of purpose,” Hulterstrum said. “It’s definitely disappointing, but it’s still worth it because, I mean, at least some people get to see it. And we love being here. And so, even though not as many people can see it, we’re thankful for the experience we have.”
 Caleb Schweim, a senior who plays the highly comedic role of Sebastian the crab, said coming to rehearsals every day has actually been a sort of therapy.
 “Honestly, I’m a bit of an introvert outside of theater,” he said with a mischievous grin, “so I kind of like this whole quarantine thing. But it is nice to have a break from my family once in a while, because being trapped in the same house with the same two people who just don’t want to hear me talk is like ….”
 Dollerschell and the cast members said they’ve worked hard to follow health and safety guidelines, even though that’s a challenge at times – especially when on stage, where so much of acting is dependent upon facial expressions. A mask covering those expressions does not work very well, Dollerschell said.
 “We don’t have a lot of kids, which isn’t ideal for a show like 'The Little Mermaid,' but on the other hand, because of the small cast it has allowed us to keep separated,” she said. “So in some ways, I think it’s worked in our favor.”
 Most of the cast plays multiple roles, and they also work as part of the stage crew, rolling set pieces on and off the stage.
 Goals have shifted on a regular basis for the cast and crew, as they first thought they might have regular-sized audiences and then learned many classmates and others might not be able to get tickets. And so they have tried to focus on what they could control – refining their characters, the sets, improving their vocals, and so on, growing as actors.
 “I think this year was more about the journey than the destination,” said Jacob Huhn, a senior who plays Prince Eric in the show, his seventh.
 That journey will take them to the live show this week. They are scheduled to perform two shows Wednesday, for a third-grade class in the morning and a fourth-grade class in the afternoon. That will be followed by the regular schedule of shows, one each Thursday through Sunday, to which cast members can invite 10-12 people, who will be socially distance throughout the auditorium.
 The cast expects to have to work a little extra to find their stage sense and deliver roles with enthusiasm before a smaller audience.
 “I think it will take a lot of energy from us as a cast, kind of working to feed off each other’s energy on stage and hopefully that can help,” Hulterstrum said. “We’re going to be excited, you know, thinking that our parents are in the audience or other people invited by use, so to me it will be exciting.”
 Added Schweim: “I’m going to put everything I have into making people laugh.”
 Students have viewed their public performances as gifts to the community in years past. Limiting attendance has been accepted with sadness, but they continue to look for the positive.
 “I have to say, this year’s case amazed me at auditions,” said Dollerschell, who has directed the LHS musical for several years. “It was probably the best audition I’ve ever had. And they came prepared and they came willing to try new things, and that was really fun.
 “I’m so grateful we got to do this,” she added. “I just can’t say enough. Even though they’re, we are, disappointed and having to make those adjustments, it’s a blessing for these kids to have something to do, when they’ve lost a lot of the things that they can do.”

As some schools begin reopening and the holiday season approaches, San Mateo County officials launched coronavirus testing for children Tuesday, serving nearly 400 minor residents with capacity for 500 per day.
 “It went terrific. People sailed through, a very easy process, very organized so we encourage people to go out and take advantage of that,” said County Manager Mike Callagy during a remote press briefing.
 Families can schedule a self-administered mouth swab test, offered through the Southern California diagnostics firm Curative, from 1 to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. The tests will be by appointment for San Mateo County-based families and will be of no charge to the public, as with tests provided for adults.
 While the county has recorded a small uptick in positive tests among youth, Deputy Chief of Health Srija Srinivasan said pediatric officials do not have “significant concerns” at this point. As of Tuesday, 1,648 residents 19 years old or younger tested positive for the virus, nearly 200 more than reported Sept. 22.
 “Overall, kids have not been a highly tested group in the earlier weeks and months of the pandemic and as testing has become more available … we do see the ability to find more cases and at this point we don’t have significant concerns,” said Srinivasan, who encouraged concerned families to seek advice from doctors or to get tested through the county if their child is experiencing symptoms such as coughing, nausea and headaches.
 Health officials have not released guidance on how often children should be tested, particularly as children begin to return to school but Callagy said the county is prepared to expand testing for children if demand rises. Chief of Health Louise Rogers said during a Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday that 25 private schools, one charter school and four additional elementary school districts received approval to reopen by Oct. 12.
 Still, many school districts in the county have opted to halt reopening plans until 2021 and the county has implored residents to abstain from family- friendly Halloween traditions like trick-or-treating.
 “It’s really the accompanying issues associated with trick-or-treating that need to be addressed, the crowds gathering, the personal interaction with the kid and the homeowner and parties and those types of things,” said Callagy. “We want to make sure we don’t slide backwards after Halloween.”
 Bay Area health officials put out a joint statement strongly “discouraging” the door-to-door tradition and instead encourage families to opt for safer ways to celebrate the holiday, including scavenger hunts, decorating homes and carving pumpkins.
 “We appreciate that families want to find ways to safely celebrate Halloween and bring joy to the household,” said Srinivasan. “We do reinforce the state’s guidance around how to safely celebrate. We want to protect each other. We want to make sure there’s lots of joy and well-being.”
 In other business, the compliance task force, developed to ensure businesses comply with state COVID-19 health orders, also launched Monday and began in- person contact with businesses Tuesday. Callagy said the county has received 80 complaints about businesses being in violation so far, ranging from gyms to restaurants but was unsure how many complaints were validated.
 Through connecting with business owners and remedying violations, officials hope to maintain steady progress through the state’s color-coded reopening framework. After being in the red, “substantial” risk tier for five weeks, Callagy said he’s optimistic the county is poised to move into the orange tier next Tuesday.
 As of Tuesday, more than 191,700 COVID-19 tests had been administered with 10,918 residents testing positive. No new deaths have been reported in a week, leaving total virus-related fatalities at 157 individuals, the majority of which are white residents 80 years old or older. Members of the Latino community still represent over half of all infections as well as young adults in the 20 to 29 age range and 30 to 39 age range.
 Hospitalizations have also continued to trend down with 18 confirmed and six suspected patients receiving care, seven in the ICU.

Three people were transported to a Lincoln hospital after the van they were in collided with a semi.
 The Gage County Sheriff’s Office responded to a two-vehicle injury crash Wednesday at around 1 p.m.
 A press release from the department stated that 20-year-old Zane Gansemier, of Nehawka, was driving a 2002 International semi hauling corn westbound Highway 41. Bridgette Korbel, 31, of Wilber, was driving a 2005 Chrysler van eastbound on the highway.
 Gansemier slowed down to turn south onto Southwest 29th Road.
 Gansemier told deputies he observed an oncoming vehicle and once the oncoming vehicle passed him, he started to make his turn. Gansemier did not see the van.

Anyone who doesn’t think human trafficking is a problem in the small-town Midwest should read J.D. Erickson’s entertaining and enlightening novel, "Angels of the Night." Erickson lives in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
 Police and anti-human trafficking activists are beset with a slate of trafficking victims who find themselves embroiled in several ways. Most tragic was the case of Mary Jacinto, a Latina woman whose battered and bruised body was found in a park restroom.
 However, the police and activists can’t go it alone. They’re assisted by the divine help of Angel Billy, a huge man of color who intercedes at key times to help victims, and also to warn those traffickers wise enough to hear his sage and heavenly advice.
 When Taney Smithson, described as the creator and driving force of SAFE, a non-profit that saved victims of sex trafficking, relates the story of one victim, Wendy Mahew, to Police Chief Ted Storm, Smithson’s reaction to Mahew’s story is very credible.
 “Taney shook her head, ‘She says an angel brought her here,’ Taney said.” Mahew was somehow transported from a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital to Taney. Taney’s reaction, as well as Chief Storm’s, makes the story real for the reader.
 The same goes for Bethany, another victim fleeing human traffickers.
 ”She slept and woke again, only to find the black man’s warm hand covering her own right hand. There were empty seats on the bus. She was a white woman with swollen, red eyes and face, and yet here he was. The warmth of his hand radiated through her, calming her. It was a strong hand. It seemed perfectly natural to be holding hands with a stranger as they rolled through the countryside.
 “Her sudden vision of that strong hand holding a golden, flaming sword startled her, and she pulled her hand away. When she looked into his face, she saw that his eyes were closed.”
 Angel Billy appeared yet again to Samantha, a would-be victim.
 “‘I supposed he was an undercover guy. A black guy, tall, wearing a flannel shirt,’ she said, looking around the room again.”
 Angel Billy makes a final appearance at the end of the novel when he tells trafficking mobster Tony Lakso, “You have much to account for.”
 While it also has its lighter moments, Erickson’s novel still highlights the tragedy of human trafficking, making us realize that all of us can be angels.
