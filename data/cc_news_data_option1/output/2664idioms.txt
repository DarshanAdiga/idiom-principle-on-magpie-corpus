The senior outfielder said the consensus was “if everyone else is in, then I’m in.”
 “It’s basically for the seniors to play one last time for their hometown,” Smith said when asked why he pushed for EHT to be in the 222-team, statewide tournament.
 “I didn’t do much. I just got everyone on the same page.”
 EHT, like many programs, could not have any affiliation with the school. Also, under New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association guidelines, high school coaches cannot coach until Monday, so EHT coach Bryan Carmichael is not involved in the tournament.
 But his players will have a familiar leader — Rodney Velardi.
 Velardi is the head coach at Atlantic Cape Community College. He also coaches Triple Crown Baseball, a travel team and showcase team based in EHT.
 “Probably about 80% or more on the team plays for me or have previously played for me,” said Velardi, who coached EHT from 2000-05 and entered the team as Triple Crown Baseball.
 “Since travel baseball in the state was allowed to start practicing in June, it just made sense (to coach EHT) since the bulk of these kids are already on this team.”
 The Last Dance opens with three pool-play games July 14-16. Sixty locations will be used statewide based on location, placing teams into 32 regions. Most regions will have two groups of four teams. The two winners play for the regional title.
 EHT is in the only region in the state with a six-team field that features all Press-area teams at Ocean City High School.
 The Raiders (Ocean City) earned the top seed. BPC Spartans (Holy Spirit) earned the second seed. EHT is No. 3, Mainland Regional is No. 4, Atlantic County RedHawks (ACIT) is No. 5 and the Millville Lightning is the sixth seed.
 “I’m looking forward to playing for EHT and riding the bus again one last time,” said Smith, 17, who will play baseball next spring at Rowan University and major in radio, television and film.
 EHT features seniors and NCAA Division I commits Sean Duffy (High Point) and Bobby Baxter (Columbia). The team has other D-I recruits, such as junior Frank Wright (Wagner) and freshman Justin Sweeney (Rutgers).
 In pool-play, EHT plays Mainland at 1 p.m. July 14, then Holy Spirit at 4 p.m. July 15 and finishes against Millville at 1 p.m. July 16.

The Louvre, the world’s most visited museum, reopened yesterday after its coronavirus closure, but with nearly a third of its galleries still shut.
 The vast former palace of France’s kings lost more than 40 million euros (US$45 million) in ticket sales during the near-four-month lockdown, and director Jean-Luc Martinez admitted it could have a few more lean years ahead as the world adapts to the virus.
 Although most of the museum’s most popular draws, like the “Mona Lisa” and its vast antiquities collection will be accessible, other galleries where social distancing is more difficult will remain closed.
 Nor will there be any crowding in front of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece for a selfie, with visitors warned that they will have to stick to standing on well-distanced spots marked on the floor.
 To avoid bottlenecks, arrows will guide visitors through the labyrinth of galleries, with doubling back banned, the museum said.
 About 70 percent of the Louvre’s 9.6 million visitors last year were from overseas, and with tourism at a standstill, Martinez said numbers could drop sharply.
 “We are losing 80 percent of our public,” he said. “We are going to be at best 20 to 30 percent down on last summer — between 4,000 and 10,000 visitors a day.”
 The museum hopes to attract more French visitors to fill the gap as it embarks on a campaign to shake off its elitist image before the Paris Olympics in four years.
 Martinez, from a working-class background, said he wanted to build on the outreach success of the Louvre’s outpost in Lens, a poor former mining town in northern France.
 He said sometimes the Louvre can “intimidate” certain demographics and it needs to reassure all people its collections are also for them.

A tireless explorer of provocative artistic vistas, he is now working on multiple new projects that fuse disparate elements in new and exciting ways. Some of them stem from “Teaching Earth,” the three-year seminar he launched during the spring 2020 semester at UCSD.
 “The full title is ‘Heating Earth, Hearing Earth, Healing Earth,’ and first up is a string quartet that focuses on the sound of the Arctic,” Liang said.

“I guess social distancing is not happening in my head,” Sandra R. Escobar said, laughing.


  The contemporary artist was describing her recently painted, coronavirus- inspired, 21-foot-high mural in City Heights titled “6 Feet Apart.” It was done in collaboration with the nonprofit group Love City Heights.


  Ironically the mural depicts everything but social distancing, she said. The faces painted in bright greens and yellows are squeezed together, with some sharing body parts.


  “It’s the humor behind it.... You’re not allowed to squeeze,” said Escobar, who is from Colombia. “My hope is that this brings people hope that all of this will be over one day.”


  The mural is part of The Avenue Mural Project, an initiative lead by Love City Heights. The group commissions local and international artists to paint murals outside businesses along a 2.5-mile stretch of University Avenue.


  Love City Heights’s goal is to complete one mural a month, but restrictions on public gatherings put two other murals in the works on hold, organizers said.

This could mean that the overall effectiveness of killing a cancer cell is higher because the treatment is attacking multiple points in that cell.

However, the Baja California state constitution currently says marriage is only between a man and a woman for the purposes of procreation.
 In order to actually get married in Baja California, gay and lesbian couples have to apply for a marriage license, wait to get rejected by a local clerk and then file an injunction with a federal court.
 Attorney Jose Luis Marquez, who helps same-sex couples file the injunctions, says the process ends up costing 10 times more than what heterosexual couples pay and takes four times longer. That means very few gay and lesbian couples have actually been able to tie the knot.
 Several Mexican states, including Quintana Roo, Coahuila and Chihuahua, as well as Mexico City, have eliminated the need for couples to get that federal injunction, thus formally legalizing same-sex marriage. Advocates hope to do the same in Baja California.

It falls far short of the Karman line, the commonly recognized boundary of space, which lies at 62 miles above the Earth's surface. And, for what it's worth, the United States doesn't officially consider you an astronaut until you cross the 50-mile altitude mark. You also won't experience weightlessness: Gravity will be more or less the same strength as it is at sea level. (By comparison, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin passengers will be able to float in zero gravity for a few minutes.)

“I was doing that again. Unfortunately, the season got shut down. But I know what I have to do.”


  With the way the Sixers have been formed, with multiple perimeter options, Embiid's value will continue to be higher closer to the basket than from 3-point range. With Simmons likely moving more to a high-post role, he could pair with Embiid to form what Brett Brown has likened to a John Stockton-Karl Malone pick-and-roll force.


  “I mean, let's just start with the respect and applause I give him for putting in time,” Brown said. “There is nobody on our team that has put in more time than Joel Embiid. And forget what he has actually done in the gym and just go to man-hours and consecutive days and the amount of days that he has put in over the last few months. I am proud of him, I respect him, and he needed to do it.”


  That's the Sixers' story, and it may be true. It's been their story in the past, and it wasn't true then. If it matters, Embiid did not appear overweight in the Zoom meeting with the press Tuesday, though he was just sitting. There has yet to be any video dropped of him playing basketball since the NBA shutdown.


  But he says he's ready, and if he isn't, it will show.


  So on to Orlando it is, for a still-underachieving force with more to prove than ever.

  “For me, it's just about being myself. I need to be more assertive. There was a lot of times this year when I was not into the offense. I was just basically going through the motions. “But with the playoffs coming, I have to be more assortative and just demand the ball and do what I do.”

Los estudiantes internacionales en Estados Unidos tendrán que abandonar el país o correr el riesgo de ser deportados si sus universidades ofrecen únicamente clases en línea durante el semestre que está por comenzar.

 De acuerdo con ICE, los estudiantes "no pueden tomar un curso completo de estudio a través de clases en línea. Si los estudiantes se encuentran en esta situación, deben abandonar el país o tomar medidas alternativas para mantener su estatus de no inmigrante, como una carga reducida del curso o un permiso médico apropiado".
 Por su parte, los estudiantes internacionales que actualmente se encuentran en Estados Unidos y que están inscritos en algún plan de estudios deberán salir del país o tomar otras medidas "como transferirse a una escuela con tutores en persona para permanecer en un estado legal". ICE indica que de lo contrario los estudiantes podrían enfrentar consecuencias de inmigración como la deportación.
 Con más de 2.9 millones de casos de COVID-19 en EE.UU., las universidades tienen hasta el 15 de julio para dar a conocer su plan para el regreso a clases, ya sea que los estudiantes regresen en su totalidad a las instalaciones, si es que operarán bajo un plan educativo híbrido o si solo ofrecerán clases en línea.

A federal judge issued a two-week restraining order Monday, July 6, suspending Graham's restrictive protest ordinance as part of an agreement between city officials and the sheriff on one side and Alamance NAACP and the ACLU of North Carolina on the other.
   
 The state ACLU, county branch of the NAACP and eight identified plaintiffs sued July 2, claiming the "two or more" protest ordinance violates their First and 14th Amendment rights of free speech and due process. Defendants, including Mayor Jerry Peterman, Police Chief Jeff Pritchard and Sheriff Terry Johnson, did not oppose a temporary restraining order pending further orders from the court. The next hearing will be July 20.
   
 For years the city has used the ordinance to move groups of self-appointed protectors of the Confederate monument in front of the Historic Courthouse off city sidewalks, and to keep demonstrators out of Court Square. Efforts to start demonstrations have intensified since the killing May 25 of George Floyd and renewed antagonism toward Confederate symbols. The named plaintiffs claim the ordinance prevented them from organizing or participating in protests in Graham.
   
 The ordinance requires a permit for "two or more" people protesting or stating a position, gives the police chief broad authority to deny permits, and even allows the chief to limit the size of a permitted demonstration to six people and prohibit minors from participating.
   
 In a Facebook post apparently written Sunday by Peterman and later taken down, he wrote, "We are being sued by some of the very people we set out to protect."
   
 The Alamance Branch of the NAACP did not respond to a Times-News question about whether and when it intends to hold demonstrations in Graham, and the Sheriff's Office has not said whether it will take any additional security measures at the monument.
   
 This does not appear to be the end of legal action. Elizabeth Haddix, managing attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was quoted in an ACLU news release saying the group would next take action to allow protests closer to the monument, which is under the jurisdiction of the Sheriff's Office.
   
 "What remains now is to get rid of the unlawful restriction of protesters' rights to exercise their First Amendment rights on the courthouse grounds at the Confederate monument site," Haddix said.

LaRose stated that sometimes those voting absentee may fail to provide all the required information. Previously, these voters would only be notified by mail, but county boards are now directed to use any email or phone contacts available, in addition to also sending a written notice to inform voters of any shortfalls and provide them information on how to quickly rectify the problem.


  The secretary of state is also ordering an increase in the minimum number of printed ballots, including absentee and provisional ballots, to ensure “shortages cannot happen.”


  Another focus will be on poll worker recruitment to ensure that there are enough people working to meet the minimum required by state law to operate a precinct. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, fewer poll workers are expected to sign up or show up on election day. Because of this anticipated shortage, LaRose stated that “unprecedented efforts” need to be made to recruit new poll workers and backups.


  County election boards must prepare and plan for the possibility of poll worker shortages and the “contingencies necessary should that situation arise,” LaRose stated in his plan. By Aug. 1, boards must send a survey to every poll worker who has served during an election within the past three years or who indicated interest in serving in the 2020 primary election. This is much earlier than the traditional timeline of poll worker recruitment, according to LaRose’s office.


  Boards must email the secretary of state’s office by Oct. 2 if they know that it has not recruited enough precinct election officials to fully staff its polling locations. All boards must report that precinct election official training was completed by Oct. 15.

Like the 1958 ring, one side features a rendering of Tiger Stadium. "When you design the ring, you want to represent obviously the team that just won, the 2019 team, but you want it to be a history of the whole program as well," Bourgeois says. "You want those guys from the 70s and the 60s to still be proud of what you're doing today. So elements like Tiger Stadium will relate across the board." The stadium is also a nod to the fans who helped drive the 2019 team to glory. "There were 102,000 people that came out to those games to support that," Ponamsky says. "So to have Tiger Stadium on there isn't just because it's a pretty facade. That's the symbol for the people that are in the stadium, that supported these guys every single time they took the field."

Back in April, Positive Coaching Alliance announced its 25 Double Goal Coach award winners, and one of those was someone well-known in the Brevard community: former Brevard College football player DeVon Holmes, who is the Health and Wellness Director at the Cindy Platt Boys & Girls Club of Transylvania County.
   
 Two months later, among those 25 coaches across the country, PCA selected its 2020 Double Goal National Coach of the Year, and Holmes was the winner of the award and the $10,000 Taube Family Prize that comes with it.
   
 "I found out I had won on June 23, and it was a lot of mixed emotions," Holmes, who graduated from Brevard College in 2014, said. "To be honest, I was actually more excited when I learned I was in the final 25. I knew once I got to that point that I had I really good shot of winning."
   
 Jamie Atkinson, the Operations Director at the Club, nominated Holmes for the Double-Goal Coach award. She said since he's come on board at the Club, he's changed hundreds of kids' lives.
   
 "During his tenure at our club, our sports program grew from one baseball team to over 10 teams across many sports thanks in large part to DeVon's constant desire to provide opportunities," she said.
   
 According to a PCA press release, when PCA talks about Double-Goal Coaching, they identify coaches who fill players' emotional tanks, allow mistakes as part of the learning process and honor the game.
   
 "Coach Holmes was described as just that," PCA said in the release. "Atkinson described how he expects mistakes during practices encouraging kids to try new things, especially plays that might scare them or be intimidating. When there is an error made, Holmes never yells or belittles a player, instead, he takes the time to talk quietly to the player one-on-one and encourage him with the positives before assisting with the item needing improvement.
   
 "Holmes also makes it a priority to respect the game even when the other team isn't doing the same. In one particular game where the other team was yelling at the refs, using foul language and parents were getting involved with negative commentary, Holmes used it as a teaching moment for his team. He encouraged his players to shake the other teams' hands after the game and then took his team aside to address what had happened and why they would never behave this way."
   
 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Boys and Girls Club has just a fourth of the kids it usually has for the summer. Holmes was supposed to fly out to California for the award presentation, but due to the pandemic, it was canceled.
   
 He said it's actually better this way.
   
 "I get to celebrate the award here with those who made the award possible," he said. "Those who made it possible are my former coaches, my family, my friends, and above all, my kids here at the Club," he said.

He's always been capable of carrying a team. It's why he was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2014 draft, why he has been a three-time All-Star, why he has rated place in the NBA's superstar class. But he hasn't always done it. Rather, he has helped win two playoff series in his first six NBA seasons. The other times, he was either injured, tired, overweight, surrounded by inferior talent or just outplayed.


  To this point, all of that was understandable, a cost of developing a dominant big man. It was a process, pardon the profanity. It has not so much been that Embiid has failed to deliver a championship or even a Final Four in a career that is close to half over as much as it was a reasonable wait for that moment.


  When the Sixers resume play Aug. 1, against the Pacers in Orlando, it will be that moment. It will be that moment because Embiid will have had nearly five months of load management time to reach peak condition. It will be that moment because other Sixers, including Ben Simmons, will have had time to recover from injury. It will be that moment because Embiid is 26, no longer a project. It will be that moment because since training camp, the Sixers have yelled that it was that moment, saying all along that they are championship-ready.


  Embiid seemed to grasp all of that Tuesday, when he met the press for the first time in months. He grasped it and owned it and promised to make it right this time.


  For that, though, he has one demand: The ball.


  “It's all about me being assertive,” he said. “If I feel like I'm not getting the ball, I just have to talk to them and do what I have to do. But at the end of the day, I should never be in position to complain about not getting the ball just because of who I am. I believe I can carry the team. I just have to take matters into my own hands.”


  Not that Embiid has ever run a confidence deficit, but that demand to be the focal point of the offense was never so brightly outlined. There were times earlier this season when he made some muffled noises about being lost in the offense. And rarely has he passed on the opportunity to try to dunk on an opposing center, always seeming to take great delight in the guy's humiliation. But he was at his self-appreciating best Tuesday, all but announcing that he doesn't just plan to win in Orlando, but that it is his time to dominate.


  “We are built for the playoffs,” Embiid said, echoing an organizational spin while half-excusing the 26 regular-season losses. “We have to keep improving. And I have to keep being on 'that guy.' I was on the path for that right before the season got shut down. I have to get back to what I was doing last year, which was dominating everybody.

The design of the three rings was no different. As LSU pulled closer and closer to an SEC title, Orgeron trusted Ponamsky, Stringfellow, and Bourgeois to focus on potential rings while he focused on winning them.

DeSean Jackson isn’t the kind of person a father points to and says, “Son, I want you to grow up to be just like him!” He was never the sort of role model that became a beloved part of Philadelphia lore, like Chuck Bednarick or Tug McGraw or Dr. J (all of whom had their personal flaws but who managed to balance them out with grace of movement, sheer force of will or an ability to channel our collective joy by jumping off the pitcher’s mound and into legend).


  But D-Jax did make some Philadelphia hearts melt and flutter with his pyrotechnics on the playing field, particularly during that unforgettable game on December 19, 2010, against the New York Giants when he helped spearhead a legendary comeback from a four touchdown deficit. Because of that display, and because I thought he was treated poorly when Chip Kelly released him, and probably because I have the martyr-like tolerance for suffering bred into every Eagles season ticket holder, I would give him a pass. If they perform well and get us to the playoffs, I can deal.


  But I can no longer “deal” with Jackson. He has shown himself to be a bigot of the highest order, someone who thinks that making Hitler references and posting anti-Semitic remarks on his public social media pages is acceptable. This is not even a close call: Over the July 4th weekend, the one where some people were out in the streets protesting against a holiday that honors “white male slaveholders,” Jackson decided to share a post from one of the most hateful, vile and bigoted people in the history of bigots, the “Minister” Louis Farrakhan. The post essentially stated that World War III would be started to stop white Jewish people in America from oppressing the Black community. It allegedly quoted Hitler, and has been universally discredited. There is no doubt, however, that it traffics in the foulest form of Jew hatred.

Singleton said earlier this spring, he proposed hiring 300 additional school nurses to help schools monitor and try to slow the spread of COVID-19. He was then approached by GOP colleagues Waggoner and McClendon, to lend his support to the Safely Opening Schools 2020 plan, which has a total cost of about $150 million, much of which could be covered by federal coronavirus relief funds, advocates said.
 Singleton, McClendon and Waggoner all sent requests for use of federal CARES Act money to Gov. Kay Ivey’s office. Waggoner, one of the highest-ranking members of the Senate, could not be reached for comment.
 Ivey’s press secretary, Gina Maiola, confirmed to Alabama Daily News that lawmakers supporting the project had recently met with staff in the Governor’s Office, but said the plan is still being assessed.
 “As schools plan to reopen in the fall, the safety of students and faculty is the governor’s top priority,” Maiola said.
 Of the state’s more than 44,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases since March, about 19 percent have been in the 5 to 24 age group, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. The virus has hit older Alabamians and those with underlying health conditions harder, accounting for most of the state’s 984 COVID-19 deaths. Still, in a recent survey, ALSDE said about 15 percent of parents are not comfortable with sending their children back to schools, in many cases because they have underlying health conditions or because they live in a household with someone at high risk for COVID-19.
 McClendon said the proposal, which includes taking every student’s and staff members’ temperature each morning and isolating those with a fever for possible further testing, would prevent potentially ill students from entering classrooms.
 “This is the only plan out there to do anything about protecting 750,000 school children and their families,” McClendon, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, said.
 McClendon is advocating for 1,400 small, free-standing structures, designed at Auburn University, at every public school. They’d cost about $50,000 each.
 “We’re trying to make our schools safer,” McClendon, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, said. “What’s going to happen when a child shows up at school and you suspect they have the COVID-19 virus. What do you do with them while you wait on a parent?”
 Requests for comment from ALSDE about the plan being pushed by the school nurses association and the three lawmakers were not returned.
 The 45-page roadmap for reopening released late last month by ALSDE said that children who fall ill at school should be placed in a designated area of quarantine with a facial covering in place. Nurses should wear N95 masks when caring for those students and parents should be called to pick the child up from school.
 In May, the Alabama Association of School Nurses surveyed the state’s 138 nurse administrators or lead nurses at each school system. The response rate was 83 percent.

By MARGERY A. BECK and JAMIE STENGLE   Associated Press     
 Missouri leaders knew the risk of convening thousands of kids at summer camps across the state during a pandemic, the state's top health official said, and insisted that camp organizers have plans in place to keep an outbreak from happening.
 The outbreak happened anyway.
 An overnight summer camp in rural southwestern Missouri has seen scores of campers, counselors and staff infected, the local health department revealed this week, raising questions about the ability to keep kids safe at what is a rite of childhood for many.
 Missouri is one of several states to report outbreaks at summer camps. The Kanakuk camp near Branson ended up sending its teenage campers home. On Friday, the local health department announced 49 positive cases at the camp. By Monday, the number had jumped to 82.
 Some states, like Oregon, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, closed summer camps this year, and many camps elsewhere have voluntarily canceled programs. But other camps are plowing ahead, hoping that precautions like social distancing, masks and requiring children to quarantine before coming to camp will quell the risk. Other states where outbreaks have been reported have included Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee.
 Missouri's outbreak at a camp operated by Christian-based Kanakuk Kamp has done little to change the way that state is handling summer camps, which essentially calls for camp operators to consult with their local public health agency to craft plans to keep kids and staff safe. Camps must report any positive cases to the state.
 Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Missouri Department of Health, said Monday that his agency had no plans to shut down summer camps in the wake of the Missouri outbreak.
 “We think school is incredibly important to kids. We also think camps are important,” Williams said.
 In fact, the camp plans to reopen later this summer once test results from all staffers are returned and show it's safe to do so, Williams said.
 Phone and email messages left Tuesday by The Associated Press for Kanakuk Kamp were not immediately returned. The organization holds six overnight and day camps across the state, usually drawing more than 20,000 kids from across the country, according to its website.
 In Texas, dozens of campers and staffers who attended Pine Cove’s Christian camps have tested positive, and several weeks of camp were canceled after clusters of cases were discovered. That includes at least 76 cases in June linked to its overnight camp for teens in Southeast Texas near Columbus. The Ridge camp shut down for two weeks in June before reopening last week, Pine Cove spokeswoman Susan Andreone said.
 The organization's Silverado camp, also near Columbus, and two of its camps in East Texas also saw staff changes or interruptions after coronavirus cases. Despite that, Andreone said more than 8,500 people had been on their camp properties through last week, and most sessions haven’t been affected. Pine Cove has 10 overnight properties in Texas.
 The spread came despite state requirements that include enforcing social distancing and banning outside visitors. As of last week, campers and staff must wear masks when social distancing isn't possible.
 “Can we guarantee that someone is not going to get COVID? Absolutely not. But we also understand that parents really know their families best, they know what their particular circumstances are or any particular risks that they have within their family,” Andreone said.
 Increases in reported cases around the country led Tara Carlson, of Omaha, Nebraska, to pull her 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter from their planned summer camps at the last minute.
 “We lost over $300," Carson said, “but we feared the risk was too great."
 Carlson said she was comfortable with efforts camps had taken against the virus, including mask requirements, limited group sizes and increased cleaning of communal areas. But she didn't want to risk picking up the virus because of regular visits with her parents, including her mom in hospice care.
 “I didn't feel I could trust what other families were doing as far as social distancing," she said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Atlanta Dream co-owner Kelly Loeffler is not in favor of the WNBA's social justice plans and has sent a letter to Commissioner Cathy Engelbert objecting to the league’s initiatives to honor the Black Lives Matter movement. Loeffler, who is also a Republican U.S. senator running for re-election in Georgia, asked the league commissioner to scrap plans for players to wear warmup jerseys with “Black Lives Matter” and “Say Her Name” and instead put an American flag on all uniforms and apparel. “The truth is, we need less - not more politics in sports. In a time when polarizing politics is as divisive as ever, sports has the power to be a unifying antidote,” wrote Loeffler. “And now more than ever, we should be united in our goal to remove politics from sports.” In the letter, Loeffler, a Dream owner since 2011, said she wasn’t consulted about the league’s new social justice policy. Engelbert issued a statement in response to Loeffler in a statement. “The WNBA is based on the principle of equal and fair treatment of all people and we, along with the teams and players, will continue to use our platforms to vigorously advocate for social justice,\" the commissioner said. \"Sen. Kelly Loeffler has not served as a Governor of the Atlanta Dream since October 2019 and is no longer involved in the day-to-day business of the team.” The WNBA players union put out a tweet Tuesday saying “E-N-O-U-G-H! O-U-T!” in response. The league announced on Monday that players would wear special uniforms during the opening weekend that had Breonna Taylor's name on the back of them. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black emergency medical technician, was shot eight times by plainclothes Louisville police officers serving a narcotics search warrant at her...

Tammy Abraham's decisive goal against Crystal Palace will be a huge boost to his confidence, says Chelsea boss Frank Lampard.
 Chelsea won a Selhurst Park thriller 3-2 on Tuesday, the 22-year-old scoring what proved to be a pivotal third goal for the visitors, his first strike since the Premier League's resumption.
 Ahead of the match, Lampard had urged Abraham to focus on his faltering form as opposed to a new contract, amid speculation over where he fits in the club's long-term plans ahead of Timo Werner's arrival.
 The striker had not scored since January 11 and lost his starting place upon the post-coronavirus restart, but Lampard was buoyed by his cool 71st-minute finish shortly after coming on for Olivier Giroud.
 "It will be really important for Tammy because he is desperate for goals," Lampard told the media.
 "He hadn't scored for a while. It helps his confidence and it is good for me. It gives me other options.
 "He came on late in the game, he scores the winning goal and I'm pleased for my strikers."
 Goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tipped Scott Dann's last-gasp header onto the post, was praised by Lampard, along with defender Kurt Zouma after his last-ditch tackle in a dramatic finish to proceedings.
 Palace made it an uncomfortable outing for Chelsea with Wilfried Zaha scoring a wonder-strike, leaving Lampard to concede his team should have managed the game better.
 "We should have had the game done at 2-0," he said. "We should have controlled the game better and then at 3-2 we had good chances to finish off.
 "With some slight wrong decisions maybe in the final third or final shot, and then it invites pressure.
 "Kepa makes a great save, Kurt makes a great tackle. But in those last moments it was nervous for us."
 The win increased Chelsea's chances of earning a top-four finish in the Premier League. With Leicester City drawing at Arsenal, the Blues move up to third in the table.

“All the teams in our group have a lot of talented guys, and all know each other,” said Smith, who added that Velardi and Carmichael share similar philosophies and run practices the same, so the team will be ready to compete.
 “We all know what to expect from each other, but I think we are going to do great. We have a lot of good chemistry, and a lot of the guys are good friends. Going into this we all have one goal — to win a state championship.”
 Smith said normally there are multiple state champions (schools are broken down into enrollment groups), but this year, there will only be one state champion, which is added motivation.
 “That’s a cool way to look at it,” Smith said.
 EHT players had been training on their own the last few months. But being on the diamond again is a different feeling.
 Along with Baxter, Duffy and Smith, EHT’s seniors are Cole Gordon, Jeremy Laboy, Ben Cericola and Will Kesnig.
 “These kids, especially the seniors, had so much taken away from them besides baseball,” Velardi said. “Their traditional graduation and prom. So many things we all experienced, they got ripped from them. So to have this opportunity is an amazing thing.
 “I think the energy is high. These kids are excited to play in this tournament and get back together. It’s great.”
 John Kroeger, who along with St. Joseph (Metuchen) athletic director and coach Mike Murray and Millburn coach Brian Chapman organized the Last Dance, said last month the Ocean City region is “the strongest in the state.”
 Velardi agreed.
 “I like our chances,” he said. “I think we’ve got a great group of highly- intelligent kids. They are good baseball kids with a ton of talent. It’s about getting them together and playing as a team.
 “The teams that are in our pool-play are some of the strongest teams. ... I think you are going to see some great baseball.”
 There is a 25-man roster limit. Teams have unlimited defensive substitutions, and could bat 10 or 11 players. There are no pitch count or inning limits. The main goal is to have seniors play as much as possible.
 And if that’s just the three pool-play games, most coaches will be happy.
 “I think it’s great the kids want to play together, and it’ll be very beneficial for the seniors to get on the field and represent their group,” said Carmichael, who, even though he cannot coach, supports his players.”
 “I’m excited for them to have this opportunity to play together.”

Coach Dave Rennie is unruffled by his separation from the Wallabies as he solidifies plans to promote youth and spurn off-shore players to get immediate results.


  Officially a week into his latest role, it is still about a month until Kiwi Rennie hits the training fields of Australia.


  Having completed two weeks of quarantine in Auckland, Rennie is spending a fortnight in his home town of Palmerston North before departing for Sydney - where another 14 days of isolation awaits.


  The 56-year-old insists he is comfortable with the set-up in which assistant coaches Matt Taylor and Scott Wisemantel connect directly with Super Rugby AU teams while he touches base remotely.


  Rennie was pleased with what he saw from the first round of games in the 12-week competition, further cementing his reluctance to look overseas for players - describing that selection method as a "slippery slope".


  "I reckon the ideal scenario is that we keep picking from within Australia, encourage players to stay there if they want to be Wallabies," he told Sky Sport NZ.


  "I'm looking forward to identifying some of those good young kids and developing them really quickly, hopefully through Super Rugby.


  "It doesn't mean that we won't grab someone from overseas but it won't be wholesale like South Africa does."


  Rennie is encouraged by the recent success of Australian age group teams against New Zealand and won't rule out throwing rookies into this year's Bledisloe Cup, if the series goes ahead.


  He believes the youngsters could inject the positivity he's after, given the Wallabies' 18 years of pain against the All Blacks.


  "It's so much about belief when you haven't beaten the All Blacks for so long. Players lack confidence," he said.


  "We've got a lot of young kids that have had success against NZ teams so they're not scarred from the past.


  "While there's probably more depth in NZ, our job is to assemble 30-40 guys who we think can be really competitive."


  Rennie said World Cup planning has not been on his agenda.


  His sole focus is October 10, which he remains adamant will be the first Bledisloe Cup Test date in Wellington, even though details of the Trans-Tasman series are yet to be announced.


  If accurate, he would have about three weeks of unhindered preparation with Wallabies players after the Super Rugby AU final on September 19.


  "It's not an enormous amount of time so we're getting a lot of planning done," Rennie said.


  "Obviously there's talk about 2023 but we need to win now.


  "I think we need to have high expectations and work hard to achieve it."

  Thomas was considered one of the Sun Valley football team's top returning players in 2021. He was an all-purpose performer who excelled as a running back, wide receiver and defensive back.


  "In this time of mourning, we ask for your thoughts and prayers for the Thomas family and all of Taz's teammates and friends," the Sun Valley football team posted on its Twitter account, @SValleyFootball. "We will all get through this extremely difficult time together as one and as the family that we are with great character and resolve that we practice every day. Taz was a tremendous young man both on and off the field and he will be forever missed by our football family. RIP #6."


  Sun Valley senior Antonio Rivera, Thomas' football teammate, wrote on Twitter, "I just lost my best friend. So talented at football ... was too young man ... I can't even finish my high school career with him. Long live Tazuan Thomas."

Moon's call for a new Trump-Kim summit and Biegun's visit had sparked speculation of a last-ditch effort to try to revive North Korea talks ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
 But given North Korea's strident rejections of new talks, Biegun's visit seemed more likely to focus on coordination between the two allies, rather than seizing some opening for diplomacy, said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul.
 "I don’t see signals from North Korea that they are looking for engagement," he said.
 Coordination between the two long-time allies is critical now, said Duyeon Kim, a senior advisor at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based independent non-profit organisation.
 "The allies should get on the same page about upcoming defence drills, how their working group can support inter-Korean projects while enforcing existing sanctions, and how to jointly respond if Pyongyang escalates or tests more weapons," she said.

I didn’t want to be somewhere in a small college town or in the middle of nowhere. My coach was a huge draw, Scott Limbaugh. He had been there only two years when I was visiting, and he was brand new. I could see the vision he had for the team and the plan he had in place to take the program from a solid team to one of the best in the country, and I really bought into what he was saying and what he believed in. I took a chance and, beyond that, it was a school I could see myself at, even if golf wasn’t in the equation. There were a lot of kids from the Northeast who go there. It wasn’t out of the ordinary for someone from where I was from to go to Vanderbilt. That made things a little easier as well. Obviously it was a good academic school and that was important.

The Sixers began mandatory individual workouts last week. When the new coronavirus shut the NBA down, the Sixers were 39-26 and the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference. Philadelphia’s first of eight regular-season games in Orlando is 7 p.m. Aug. 1 against the Indiana Pacers.
 The Sixers are scheduled to leave Thursday for Walt Disney World’s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando, where the NBA is creating a bubble atmosphere to keep teams in and the virus out.
 Embiid isn’t sure just how safe things will be.
 “I hated the idea,” he said. “All I want to be is to stay healthy. I want to make sure I’m able to live for a long time and not have any consequences in the future. I’m not a big fan of the deal, but I’m going to do my job. I’m not going to let the city down. I’m going to represent my city. That’s what I’ve always done.”
 Embiid is concerned that other players and personnel might try to sneak out of the Orlando bubble.
 “I know I’m going to do the right things,” he said. “I don’t ever do anything. I only play video games. I’m always home. But I don’t trust those other guys to do the same. But like I said, I got to do my job.”
 The Sixers need Embiid at his best to make a deep playoff run. But his comments Tuesday raised several issues that have troubled the team in the past.
 The primary question with Embiid is always about his conditioning. Sixers coach Brett Brown said last week that Embiid has worked hard the past few months. Sixers guard Josh Richardson said Embiid looks like he lost some weight.
 Embiid’s response on his conditioning was a bit more ambiguous.
