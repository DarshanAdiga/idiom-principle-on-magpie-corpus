Paul McCartney’s handwritten lyrics for _Hey Jude_ are just one of hundreds of Beatles-related items set to go under the hammer next month.
 Julien’s Auctions will hold the sale at the Times Square Hard Rock Cafe in New York and online on April 10 – 50 years to the day since McCartney indicated that The Fab Four were over.
 Along with the _Hey Jude_ lyric sheet, the sale will also feature memorabilia, guitars and instruments, autographed items, rare vinyl, obscure licensed material and more.
 Some of the other highlights include a baseball signed by McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr from the Beatles’ last ever US show at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, and a pair of beige wide-cut corduroy trousers worn by Lennon on the _Magical Mystery Tour_.
 There’s also the original stage from the Beatles’ first performance from Liverpool’s Lathom Hall, which took place on May 14, 1960 when the band were billed as The Silver Beats. It was the group's first advertised concert and booked by Liverpool promoter Brian Kelly.
 The sale will get under way at 10am local time on April 10. Visit Julien’s Auctions for further information.
 In 2015, Julien’s Auctions sold Ringo Starr’s drum kit that he played on Beatles hits including _Can’t Buy Me Love_ and _I Want to Hold Your Hand_ for £1.4million ($2.2m).

The Sharp has, what other reviewers at PC Mag and CNet claim are extremely deep blacks. In fact, they're the deepest black levels of any set I've ever seen in person. (Maybe that newly crowned Panasonic Plasma Gary Merson reviewed last week is deeper, or those LED backlit displays from Samsung we saw at CES.) It's got a powerful "5-wave" backlighting that is blindingly bright. Combine that with a 4ms response time and 120Hz refresh rate that interpolates the frames in between your average 60Hz signal, and you've got a bunch of powerful stats that amount to a powerful picture. I turned off the black level enhancement (doesn't need it and it washes out the grays.) That gave it much better shadow detail, even if not as good as the Pioneer. Before and after calibration with SpyderTV I found it blue/cold before tweaking white balance. But the colors were better out of the box. Yes, better.

Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease that causes small granulomas in the multiple organs of the body mainly lungs, lymph nodes and skin where the nodules are filled with inflammatory cells. The person with sarcoidosis initially experiences fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, pain and swelling in joints, reddish bumps or patches on the skin or under the skin. According to the America’s population based study in the year 2010-2013, around 29,372 adult patients with sarcoidosis were reported. 14,700 of these were 55 years of age at the time of diagnosis. For African Americans the incidence rate is higher, 17.8 and 141.4 per 100,000 respectively, for Asians (3.2 and 18.9), white peoples (8.1 and 49.8) OR Hispanics (4.3 and 21.7). The incidence rate of having sarcoidosis in women is two times higher than men. Afro-American women have the highest sarcoidosis prevalence of 178.5.

 And meanwhile, the Prime Minister gathered ministers for an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss the next steps to tackle the illness.
 While some other European countries are cancelling mass gatherings or limiting the number of people who can attend big events, Oliver Dowden said there are "no plans" for Britain to follow suit.
 Mr Dowden insisted the Government is following the advice of health officials and, while the situation is kept under review, there is currently "no need" to cancel big events or for people to avoid museums or other public places.

I have always been a fan of an observation made by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. In discussing the absolute value of transparency, Brandeis famously wrote, "Sunlight is the best disinfectant."
 Likewise, freedom of speech (it is the First Amendment), freedom to publish, what is demonstrably true, and an inclination to err on the side of openness, are all equally wonderful disinfectants.
 Yet in courtrooms across this county, and elsewhere, both journalists and the public are often denied that openness, that transparency, that truth that is at the heart of what gives both power and legitimacy to the courts.
 In New York, for example, we continue to embrace an antiquated and unsupervised system of justice courts. These courts which largely operate as traffic violations bureaus, are sometimes called on to function at higher levels, issuing search warrants and conducting arraignments.
 They are most often presided over by citizens, elected by their peers, but who lack the formal education and training of legal professionals. While there are many justices in these courts who have invested in learning the law and the rules of court procedures, they are far too many who view their courts as fiefdoms.
 And there are too many who easily fall prey to the manipulation of members of the bar (the defense bar primarily, but prosecutors are not without sin either) and can be conned into such abuses as closing courtrooms, sealing records without good cause or issuing gag orders on the litigants.
 But these abuses of discretion are not limited to the justice courts. There is a worrying trend taking place in the superior courts as well, particularly at the county court level.
 We have seen a spike in the issuance of gag orders, including most recently, in the case of Yasin Abdu-Sabur. The Abdu-Sabur matter is a high-profile cold case homicide prosecution.
 It's the kind of case that demands transparency.

Post-Fiend, it's the perfect time to reboot Bryan and even him out with Gulak, who wouldn't be on Bryan's kayfabe level normally. We got a got a rare catch- as-catch-can clinic here as Gulak got elevated up to a tier where he could go toe-to-toe with Bryan, even staying a few steps ahead of him. Bryan's neck injury also came into play since Gulak is all about exploiting his opponent's weakness. In many ways, this match felt more vital and dangerous than Bryan's PPV main event matches with The Fiend.

While Livent may be a growing company in a growing industry, it is a mining company at the end of the day and is highly susceptible to cyclical risks. Thus, it should not be trading at such extreme-forward valuations. Quite frankly, a 15X forward "P/E" or 10X forward "EV/EBITDA" would be more reasonable, though many mining companies that produce other metals trade at even lower valuations than that.
 ## The Bottom Line
 LTHM is a "sell" today with multiple active bearish catalysts. While I was bullish on the stock, the company rallied without the bullish factors I have in mind coming true (i.e higher lithium prices). Further, the Coronavirus black-swan event is very likely to keep lithium prices and sales volumes depressed this year (particularly for batteries). While lithium producers are likely to slow production growth, the fact is that lithium production will likely continue to grow in the face of falling demand and exacerbate the glut.
 Overall, I believe LTHM is a "sell" with a target price of $4.5 to match a forward "P/E" just below 15X. That said, LTHM's earnings are likely to decline over the coming quarters so the stock may fall even lower. In my opinion, long investors should sell as soon as possible as I believe that Monday's equity gains are a bull-trap.

I bring that into my work and advocate for recognizing the vast audience that’s out there at any opportunity. I’m very proud that The Sims team has such a high percentage of female developers in this predominantly male industry. And we’ve made The Sims the top PC game for female players in the US. I am honored anytime I can attend Grace Hopper or present to the Girls Who Code about why we NEED them to help us make better games. My daughter is already really excited to play games and I plan to introduce her to all kinds of them.

It used to be that the only way you could issue a warning for was the whole county. Good at warning vast amounts of people of severe weather, but it is also a good way to raise the false alarm rate as well. A tornado is not a very large circulation and can be up to a few miles wide for the largest of them. Even a few miles doesn't span an entire county, so the NWS started issuing storm based warnings or polygon warnings instead. This is a more accurate way to track where the storms impacts might be felt, but warnings still get issued for the entire county usually. With the advent of newer technology some services like WeatherCall, do issue warnings only for those in the polygons. We have more information on WeatherCall on our website nwahomepage.com under the weather tab.

By the time he got there, his daughter, Emerson, had already received one shock from the AED, and it administered another while he was there.
 When emergency responders arrived, they quickly loaded her into the ambulance and transported her to Sheridan Memorial Hospital.
 Nobody was quite sure what happened. Some thought Emerson slipped on ice and hit her head, others thought she may have had a seizure.
 No matter the cause, physicians knew that if Emerson had any sort of serious condition, the best place for her to receive care was at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora.
 Thanks to the quick action of the staff at Woodland Park Elementary – particularly of school nurse Noele Mena – Emerson will have the chance to play nearly any sport she desires over her lifetime.
 In Denver, doctors have diagnosed Emerson with congenital long QT, which according to the Mayo Clinic, is “a heart rhythm condition that can cause fast, chaotic heartbeats” that may trigger fainting spells, seizures or sudden death.
 On Thursday, Emerson underwent surgery to receive an internal defibrillator and pacemaker.
 According to Kelley, though, the outcome could have been much worse.
 “Doctors here and in Sheridan have said this is a save of a lifetime,” Kelley said over the phone from the hospital in Denver. “They saved her the chance to have a normal life.”
 Because Mena and the team at Woodland Park Elementary acted quickly, they helped ensure Emerson did not suffer brain damage or other long-term impairments.

The Wild’s Alex Stalock got no help Saturday in allowing six goals (one, the sixth on the game for the Kings, was empty net). By the seventh of the game, he appeared roundly disinterested, waving at a puck that sped right by him. Sunday, the Wild had Devan Dubnyk in the cage. He had been out for seven straight games and all but two of the last 13 on the Wild schedule.

This is not your father's photo booth. Step into the Fototron2000 with its robot artist lurking within, and you may never look at yourself the same way again. The techno-beast's arm has LEDs at the end of it, and while you stand there it paints you with the LED light. Then its computer artist brain extracts the brightness contours of its images and does a long exposure of these edges on Polaroid film.
