Recently the two companies announced a tighter integration between VMware Cloud on Dell EMC within its version 2 release which offers improved support for high-density and high-performance data centre applications.
 VMware Cloud on Dell EMC consists of VMware’s high-performance compute, storage and networking software, powered by VMware vSphere, vSAN and NSX, tightly integrated with Dell EMC VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) hardware and delivered as a service. These solutions are all managed by VMware.
 In February, Dell revealed the sale of its cyber security unit, RSA for US$2.08 billion to a consortium headed by Symphony Technology Group, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board and AlpInvest Partners.
 The two companies expect the deal to close within the next six to nine months, claiming until then things would remain business as usual. In a blog, Dell Technologies vice chairman products and operations, Jeff Clarke said it was the right long term strategy for both companies.

However, the practice of one-party systems and Big Man Rule neither brought economic development and built a unified nation nor did it confer the much- needed legitimacy to the states and governments. The primacy of personal patronage, loyalty, and dependence around the presidency over constitutional rules and laws for opportunities in politics and in business drained these states’ hope for development and progress. These states became captives to their new presidents and their cronies and ready for capture by their opponents when circumstances permitted.

“TPG shareholders have voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed merger with VHA,” TPG chairman David Teoh said.
 “This is an important milestone to have reached as we work to bring together our two highly complementary businesses to create a leading integrated, full- service telecommunications company with a comprehensive portfolio of fixed and mobile products in the Australian telecommunications market.”
 According to VHA CEO Iñaki Berroeta, the scheme of arrangement vote is one of the final steps towards implementation of the merger, which has been in the works for nearly two years.
 “Today is a significant milestone in the merger process and subject to final court approval, we will be bringing VHA and TPG together in two and a half weeks,” Berroeta said.
 “The merger will create a leading full-service telecommunications provider which will be well-positioned to drive stronger competition in the market and deliver benefits to customers and shareholders,” he added.
 Now that the merger has formal shareholder backing, the company will seek court orders for approval of the scheme at a hearing scheduled for Friday, 26 June. If the scheme is approved by the court, it will become effective on Monday 29 June 2020.

Also, let’s not forget that we are talking about Ethiopia where the political elite, not the people, hold diametrically opposed views about the historical trajectory of the country ranging from a history of nation-building to colonial domination to national oppression. In light of such a contested account of history, democracy is really the minimum core and the trusted virtue for all Ethiopians to even indigenize democracy.

It is long overdue that our media (including children's media) stops treating non- heterosexual people as nonexistent, or as something merely to be mocked. I'm only sorry it took us so long to have this kind of representation in one of our stories."

Barcelona said the fan tokens are part of the club’s world-wide expansion strategy as it looks for new digital channels and formats to generate greater engagement with its international fan base. They have been incorporated as the club tries to develop “new streams for the generation of resources” and to become a “benchmark both on and off the field.”
 The first survey in which Barcelona token owners can vote on is related to the artwork of a mural that will decorate the dressing room at the Camp Nou.
 Juventus was the first club to launch its fan tokens about six months ago, with its supporters choosing the celebration song that is now played when the team scores a goal.
 The first PSG poll in February allowed fans to choose an inspirational message to go on the captain’s armband, and Galatasaray’s supporters picked the song played when the team enters the field. Roma fans voted on the name of a field at the club’s training center, and Atlético Madrid’s supporters chose player Álvaro Morata to give exclusive insight into the club’s daily life.
 The tokens became a more significant engagement tool during the coronavirus pandemic. PSG players Edison Cavani and Thiago Silva sent personal messages to fans, and Galatasaray token owners gained life-sized cardboard photos of themselves in the team’s stadium.
 “The pandemic forced the clubs to look at the other 99% of fans that can generate revenue,” Dreyfus said. “It forced them to reconsider and to try to monetize their global fan base.”

Once that happens, TPG shares, under the current ASX code ‘TPM’, will be suspended from trading on the ASX from the close of trading on Monday 29 June. Vodafone Hutchison Australia will then change its name to TPG Telecom Limited on Monday 29 June.
 The new TPG Telecom Limited will then be admitted to the ASX under the code ‘TPG’ on Tuesday 30 June, with trading to commence on a deferred settlement basis. According to TPG, the scheme itself will be implemented on Monday 13 July.
 The fruition of TPG and VHA’s plans to combine their resources into a single entity has been long in the works. It was in late August 2018 when TPG Telecom confirmed that it was in discussions with Vodafone Hutchison Australia regarding a potential "merger of equals".
 In May 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) decided to oppose the proposed $15 billion merger between the two companies.

E-waste is having a significant negative impact on Africa. With a huge market for electronic goods, many people do not consider what happens to their products once disposed of. Worldwide, we produce approximately 50m tonnes of e-waste every year. Although approximately 20% of our e-waste will be repurposed, a massive amount often ends up as landfill which is burnt, traded illegally or not disposed of effectively, leading to hazardous substances leaking into the environment. The proper disposal of e-waste remains a significant problem. Heavy metals including lead, cadmium and mercury that are usually found in fridges, LCD screens and air-conditioning units not only pollute soil and water but can enter the food chain creating a toxic mix of negative health effects.

What makes the struggle for democracy difficult in Africa is mainly the absence of a genuine commitment for it from the political elite. Democracy has become a justification for incumbents to remain in office through their flawed elections and an organizing principle for state capture by their opponents. And the tendency and propensity toward corruption among those in government and their affiliates in business and the similar drive to exit among those marginal to these systems have weakened the legitimacy of many of the states and governments in Africa.[1]
