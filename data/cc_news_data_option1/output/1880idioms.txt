Iranian authorities on Monday said that a missile struck the Iranian navy vessel Konarak near the port of Jask, some 1,270 kilometers (790 miles) southeast of Tehran in the Gulf of Oman. Authorities said the Konarak was too close to a target and was accidentally hit Sunday in an incident that also wounded 15 troops.

EU aid to Eritrea has a history of being cancelled and failing to be disbursed. However, in February 2019, the EU announced on that EUR 20 million would be provided directly to Eritrea through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa ('ETFA'). In December 2019, an additional EUR 60 million was announced. The EU will provide the money to the Eritrean regime’s proxy company, which will be used for the purchase of materials and equipment to repair parts of the road network. The procurement process is led by the RSTC (i.e. the Eritrean regime). The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) offers assistance. The RSTC leads the “ _governance and coordination structure_ ” of the project, whereas major national construction companies (inc. Segen) carry out the work.

ABUJA: Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday named a former top UN diplomat as his new chief of staff, replacing powerful aide Abba Kyari after he died last month of COVID-19. The presidency announced the appointment of Ibrahim Gambari, 75, on Twitter. Gambari served as Buhari´s foreign minister when he was Nigeria´s military ruler in the 1980s and later went on to become a UN under-secretary general for Africa during Kofi Annan´s tenure. Kyari´s death on April 17 has rocked Nigerian politics. A loyal lieutenant and long- time confidant of the president, Kyari was often viewed as the second most powerful person in the country. He played a vital role as gatekeeper to Buhari and had been accused of using his influence to control the president´s decision-making. Political analyst Dapo Thomas said the new chief of staff was seen as an “apolitical” veteran who would not “be swayed by partisan politics, ethnic and religious considerations”. “Gambari is a seasoned and respected diplomat who has played significant roles in the international arena,” Thomas, an academic at the University of Lagos, told AFP. “He has very intimidating credentials. His coming to government will give more credibility, recognition and respect to the president.

The Michael Flynn case will soon be over. It began on Jan. 24, 2017, just four days into the Trump administration, when two FBI agents went to the White House to interview Flynn, then the brand-new national security adviser. Ignoring protocol, they questioned him about a phone call he had a few weeks before, during the transition, with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. By the end of the year, Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in that interview.                                Now, the Justice Department has moved to drop the charges, and a judge will soon accept that decision. But before the Flynn matter recedes into history, there is more the public needs to learn about it. Specifically, the public needs to know more details about the way the FBI handled the politically sensitive case. And even more specifically, how do we know what Flynn said in that interview on Jan. 24?                                In accordance with usual FBI practice, the interview was not recorded. The agents took notes during the interview and were supposed to return to the office to write up what was said. The write-up is a form known as the FD-302. FBI rules give agents five working days to finalize the document.                                If someone is going to be charged with lying to the FBI, it will be on the basis of what is in the 302. There's no recording and there are no other witnesses in the room. If an interview subject claims not to have said something, the proof otherwise is the 302 and the agents' word. So the 302 is obviously critical if the Justice Department chooses to charge someone for lying in an FBI interview.                                That's why it is important to know the tortured history of the Flynn 302. In the Flynn case, nothing worked as it should have. Nothing. It is believed that one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, whose identity has, remarkably, never been publicly revealed but has been widely reported to be an agent named Joe Pientka, wrote a 302 shortly after the interview. That recollection, the freshest memory possible, is usually regarded as the most reliable version of what was said in the interview.                                Here is the amazing thing: Michael Flynn's defense has never seen the original 302. Never. Flynn, under enormous pressure from Trump-Russia special counsel Robert Mueller, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI without ever reading what Pientka originally wrote about the interview.                                Instead, the FBI almost immediately began editing the Flynn 302. Pientka's partner in the interview, Peter Strzok -- remembered as the agent dismissed from the Mueller special counsel investigation for his anti-Trump texts with extramarital lover (and senior FBI official) Lisa Page -- took the lead. On Feb. 10, after the FBI's five working days limit expired, Strzok did what was apparently a major editing job on the Flynn 302, and he also incorporated edits suggested by Page, who had not been present at the interview. In a text message, Strzok said, "I was trying not to completely re-write the thing so as to save [REDACTED] voice." It's thought that the redacted name was Pientka's. The finished document was dated Feb. 14, 2017, which just happened to be the day after Flynn was fired by the White House.                                But wait, there's more. At the time all this was happening, top FBI officials did not think Flynn would be charged. Then-director James Comey told Congress exactly that in March 2017. The Flynn case, apparently, was put on the shelf. But then, on May 17, 2017, Trump-Russia special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed. The Flynn file came down off the shelf as Mueller's team looked for a way to exert pressure on Flynn to spill whatever he knew about some prosecutors' preferred theories of collusion.                                And then -- Voila! -- came an all-new 302. In December 2018, as part of Flynn's sentencing, the public saw another document entirely. It was called the Flynn 302, but it was, in fact, a record of an interview of Strzok -- not Flynn -- conducted by another FBI official on July 19, 2017. Even then, after all the changes, it was hard to see the document as the basis of charges against Flynn.                                "Throughout the interview, Flynn had a very 'sure' demeanor and did not give any indicators of deception," the 302 read. "He did not parse his words or hesitate in any of his answers. He only hedged once, which they documented in the 302. Strzok and [Pientka] both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying."                                Is it any wonder why Republicans have had questions about the Flynn prosecution? Now, it appears to have come to nothing with the Justice Department's move to drop the case against Flynn. But even if Judge Emmet Sullivan, as expected, dismisses the charges, there are still things -- important things -- the public needs to know about the case. Like, what, precisely, was said during that fateful interview at the White House on Jan. 24, 2017?

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The CEO of the world's busiest airport for international travel wants to get the globe flying again, but even he acknowledges everything remains up in the air during the coronavirus pandemic. Paul Griffiths oversees what now is a much quieter Dubai International Airport, home to the long-haul carrier Emirates and crucial to East-West travel. The millions that once poured through the airport's concourses are no longer flying as countries around the world enforce lockdowns and travel bans to fight the virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes. Though government-owned Emirates plans to restart some flights next week, Griffiths told The Associated Press that the airport has yet to find a workable coronavirus or antibody test to administer on a massive scale to passengers. Until a vaccine or a permanent solution to the virus exists, there could be “quite a low level of activity for quite some time,” he said. “I think the thing is there are a lot of people that are offering conjecture, whether it’s 18 months or two years or less or more,\" Griffiths said in an interview Wednesday. “But the problem is it’s all conjecture. The honest answer is no one really knows.” The airport known as DXB saw 86.4 million passengers in 2019, 6 million more than second-place Heathrow Airport in London. That’s down 3% from 2018 when Dubai had 89.1 million passengers. But air travel this year has been disrupted by the virus. In the first quarter, Dubai International Airport's passenger numbers dropped by nearly a fifth to 17.8 million compared to last year. Cargo and repatriation flights have been flying, however. Beginning May 21, Emirates plans to operate flights to nine cities, including Chicago; Frankfurt, Germany; London; Madrid; Milan; Paris; Toronto; and Sydney and Melbourne in...

WATERTOWN — The mediator who will intercede in the case between the firefighters’ union and the city wants it to move ahead quickly and be handled in a video conference.                                    After meeting just one time in February, the city and the Watertown Professional Firefighters Association Local 191 both filed an impasse in their labor negotiations.                                    William Conley, director of conciliation with the Public Employment Relation Board in Albany, named himself as the mediator, City Attorney Robert J. Slye said.                                    Mr. Conley notified both parties he’d like to start working on the issue in the next week through a video conference. He gave a few dates to start the process, but Mr. Slye said City Manager Kenneth A. Mix and human resource director Matthew Roy are too busy working on the city’s $41.9 million budget that includes 23 layoffs.                                    “We just can’t do it,” he said.                                    Mr. Slye also expressed concerns about handling the process through a video conference and would rather meet face to face.                                    On Feb. 28, the city and the union met for their first negotiations in four years with both sides not budging on the same sticking point — minimum manning. The session produced no results, so both sides declared an impasse.                                    Union president Daniel Daugherty said it’s going to be different if it goes to a video conference, which he favors in light of the coronavirus pandemic.                                    It’s also happening faster. This time, it’s taken just two months to get to the mediation stage. When the fire contract expired in 2014, it took almost a year.                                    “I’m just glad that the mediator wants to begin,” he said.                                    The city continues to insist that the stipulation that 15 firefighters be on duty at the same time remained on the negotiating table. The union will not talk about minimum manning.                                    That issue was the sticking point that stalled talks during their six-year labor dispute.                                    Legal arguments over arbitration regarding the minimum manning issue made it all the way to the state’s highest court, with the union winning.                                    The two sides avoided further arbitration on Nov. 23, seemingly ending their contentious legal battles.                                    In January, the election brought Mayor Smith and new Councilman Jesse Roshia into office. The mayor has been a longtime critic of the union and minimum manning.                                    The relationship between the city and the union has become more testy after the mayor recently proposed cutting down on the number of fire department’s medical calls.                                    The firefighters have not had a contract since 2014.                                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Staying open has kept the bill collectors at bay. "I have a mortgage, I have insurance. I'm on terms with my vendors. We rent the space at the French, so I'm still paying rent," Betulia said. "I asked for a deferral from the landlord, but he doesn't really know what's going on right now. I have to grind it out to make that money. Is it worth it to operate at 25 percent? Maybe yes, maybe not. But for me, 25 percent is better than zero percent."


  Betulia said the pandemic has spurred him to make changes in his business models, and not only for the short term. He's trying to lease part of an adjacent parking lot to make more space and a possible beer garden for Bar Tulia. At the French, he turned a breezeway into a makeshift cocktail cafe. And he challenged his chefs to incorporate meal kits and grab-and-go items into the menus going forward.


  Still, he believes people still want to go out for a meal. "To see your food, to smell it, to be served -- you're not going to experience that at home," he said. "Besides, my cacio e pepe needs to be eaten immediately. If you take it home, it gets too sticky."


  A block closer to Naples Beach at the French, director of operations Colleen Dunavan told me the first week of service after reopening was like no other. "It was so strange," Dunavan said as I waited for a table to open up.  "We had been out for about two months, and in that time everyone forgot their jobs to some degree."


  She described the mood among the restaurant's clientele as cautiously jovial, adding, "A few regulars came over to shake my hand, and I had to explain that we can't do that anymore."


  Though I was seated six feet from any other table, I could still hear the familiar clink of glasses and silverware from my neighbors. It was a perfect Florida evening, with low humidity and a slight breeze. For a few moments, sipping on a drink at a restaurant for the first time in two months, I forgot my fears about the future.

“Everything we've heard from our partner agencies and stakeholders is saying that we know we have tenants who are already telling us when the restrictions are lifted that they can't pay,” Guessford said.


  “There are still people who aren't going to be back to work for quite some time even when the restrictions are lifted. Just because restrictions are lifted doesn't mean the money is going to be there. People are scared.”


  Guessford said that while the extra federal funds will be useful, donations to the local fund are still needed.


  “At first the donations were coming in rapid-fire, so fast and furious,” Guessford said. “For the past week to 10 days, they have significantly dropped off. People are getting comfortable, and they don't feel the same sense of urgency they once had. That's where we're getting very nervous, that the donations are starting to slow and the need is still there.


  “People get used to this and it doesn't feel like everything is on fire like it once was, while the need is just growing, unfortunately.”

  Guessford said the need is as great as it was in the beginning of the pandemic.


  “It's not lost on us that people are suffering. It's not lost on us that we've asked a lot,” she said. “But we're asking a lot because the need is so great.


  “We're grateful for all support, the large donors and the small donors. Everybody matters. Every dollar matters. But we can't relax now, because people are still suffering.”

I have been praising Donald Trump long before he became president. I have praised him more than anyone in the United States, China, Europe or anywhere.                                    My praise has been fantastic, and I have received incredible response from everywhere, especially from Republican governors. They are all great friends and incredible Americans. The best.                                    And the leaders of our great businesses are all great friends of mine and Trump. They are fantastic, I should say brilliant men. And, of course, some talented women, too.                                    When the novel coronavirus came, I supported Trump’s fantastic job in keeping people from panicking by not revealing the problem or letting anyone know what the intelligence committees were telling him. And then some liberals wanted to start testing, and nobody but Trump could have done the incredible job he did when he said there were hundreds of thousands of tests on the way when there were almost none. This was a tremendous and fantastic ploy — brilliant, I would say. No tests meant no increase in cases and no harm to the economy.                                    He stopped people coming from China who might have had the Chinese flu and he often and rightly brags about this as his key weapon against the virus. The 40,000 people who came in from China starting the day after his edict were not tested for the virus lest the increase in the number of cases upset the people of this great country, which Trump rescued from the ashes of the Obama administration, as he made America great again. We have never had such an incredible economy and keeping the numbers of cases down has been a fantastic help in keeping the stock market at its highest levels ever.                                    Trump is the greatest president we have ever had. Fantastic. No other president would have had the courage to require the opening of the meat processing plants across the country to boost the economy knowing that most of the plants have no requirement for any safety regulations and that some people would have to make the supreme sacrifice. This took incredible courage and fantastic foresight.                                    Trump would have been a great officer in the U.S. Army. Officers have to lead and that means engaging the enemy and that requires soldiers, mostly enlisted men, being injured or killed. Trump says “this is a war.” In this war against the coronavirus, Trump has put workers who, like privates, corporals and sergeants have the lowest salaries. These men and women earn from $8 to $15 an hour.                                    The families of these workers, unlike the families of soldiers, will receive no insurance benefits for injury or death. Another fantastic move so the economy will not suffer and Trump can get re-elected. How many presidents would have risen to such an incredible level of bravery in a pandemic? I wish I had a fantastic leader like Trump when I was in the Army.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. military offered condolences Thursday to Iran over a friendly fire incident in the Islamic Republic that killed 19 of its troops, identifying the weapon used in the incident as an anti-ship cruise missile.             Iranian authorities on Monday said that a missile struck the Iranian navy vessel Konarak near the port of Jask, some 1,270 kilometers (790 miles) southeast of Tehran in the Gulf of Oman. Authorities said the Konarak was too close to a target and was accidentally hit Sunday in an incident that also wounded 15 troops.            In a statement, Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said the force offered “our sincere condolences to the Iranian people for the tragic loss of life.” However, Urban also criticized the training for taking place so close to the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil passes.            “While we are troubled that this mishap occurred in such close proximity to a high-traffic international shipping lane and at a time when most of the region’s focus is on the fight against COVID-19, the unnecessary loss of life is regrettable,” he said.             Tensions had been expected to rise after  Iran’s government overcame the initial chaos that engulfed its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In April, the U.S. accused Iran of conducting “dangerous and harassing” maneuvers near American warships in the northern Persian Gulf. Iran also had been suspected of briefly seizing a Hong Kong-flagged oil tanker just before that.            President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers two years ago, launching a maximum pressure campaign against Iran that has repeatedly pushed the arch-rivals to the verge of conflict.            Analysts have warned regional tensions will likely increase again. This week also marks the year anniversary of attacks on oil tankers near the strait that the U.S. blamed on Iran.

Mothers like Margaret Andeya, who is struggling to make ends meet, said the coronavirus hairstyle suits her daughters’ styling needs and her pocket. Virus-related restrictions have stifled the daily work for millions of people with little or no savings.            “This hairstyle is much more affordable for people like me who cannot afford to pay for the more expensive hairstyles out there and yet we want our kids to look stylish,” Andeya said.            It costs 50 shillings, or about 50 U.S. cents, to get the braids while the average hairdo costs 300 to 500 shillings ($3 to $5). That’s money most people in Kibera cannot afford at the moment.            The technique used in braiding the coronavirus hairstyle is threading, which uses yarn instead of synthetic hair braids. This is the secret to making it affordable, residents said.            “COVID-19 has destroyed the economy, taken our jobs from us, and now money is scarce. I therefore decided to have my child’s hair done up like this at an affordable 50 shillings, and she looks good,” said 26-year-old Mariam Rashid.            “The hairstyle also helps in communicating with the public about the virus.”

Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner were teammates on the defensive line for seven of the past eight seasons whether in college at Oregon or in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers.            So when Armstead got rewarded with an $85 million, five-year contract in free agency from San Francisco on the first day of free agency this offseason, the news that followed was a little disconcerting.            The Niners had traded Armstead’s longtime running mate to Indianapolis for a first-round pick.            “It was of course an interesting day to say the least,” Armstead said Wednesday. “A lot of excitement of course, signing back with the Niners that definitely was what I wanted to do. Then learning about DeFo being traded was a shock to me. Trying to figure out how that happened and what went on.”            What went on was that the Niners decided they couldn’t afford to keep both their star defensive linemen under the salary cap. With Buckner owed $12.4 million on the fifth-year option on his rookie deal and looking for a lucrative long-term contract that he eventually got from the Colts, the Niners decided it made more sense to keep Armstead and get a high draft pick for Buckner that turned into his replacement, Javon Kinlaw.            Armstead said he never thought that his deal could have lead to his friend’s departure and said it will be “weird” to play without Buckner. The only other time he’s done it since the two arrived at Oregon together in 2012 came during Armstead’s rookie year in the NFL in 2015.

Chef Vincenzo Betulia didn't shutter his three Fifth Avenue restaurants when dining rooms were ordered closed in March. Instead, he and his staff pivoted directly to a takeout-and-delivery model. When the governor reopened most of Florida on May 4, Betulia reopened the dining rooms at Osteria Tulia and the French (365 Fifth Ave. S., Naples; 239-315-4019; thefrenchnaples.com), adhering to the mandated 25 percent capacity indoors and outside tables spaced six feet apart. (His other property, Bar Tulia, remains closed, though he's using some of the space to augment the seating capacity of Osteria Tulia, which is next door.)


  "We've been full from right away day one [of the reopening].  We're doing more in sales on days like today than last year at full capacity, " Betulia said. He was quick to add, however, that the past week's brisk business hasn't come close to making up for the lost revenue of the prior few months: "I went from $20,000 a day to about $1,800 a day."


  Betulia said the decision to open at 25 percent capacity was the right one for him. "We're a business and we have to continue," he reasoned. "I have 230 employees. After the closure order, 215 were furloughed. I stayed open any way I could. We were collecting tips and distributing it to the staff. I paid their health insurance. These people are my family and I have to take care of my family. If I have the opportunity as a business owner to open, then yeah, for sure I'm going for it. I'm not going to roll over and stay in bed. I'm going to work."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.


  Democrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party’s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden’s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.


  For President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president’s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.


  “Partisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,” said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama’s White House National Security Council.


  The renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation’s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he’s also running to restore some of the former president’s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.


  Yet Trump’s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America’s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

  You can't have your cake and eat it too is a proverb that could be of use to some Australian officials, who continue to escalate tensions with China while hoping bilateral trade will remain intact.      On Wednesday, Australian Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham requested urgent talks with Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, according to a Reuters report. At the same time, however, Birmingham said Australia would continue to push for an international inquiry into the COVID-19 outbreak.      China has made it clear that the recent beef import suspensions and tariff threats on barley shipments are not politically motivated, and that its decisions are made based on normal market rules and facts. While China has no interest in "economically coercing" Australia, as was speculated by some politicians, it is no secret that unfriendly moves from the Morrison government have thrown bilateral ties into a deep freeze.      And there is no guarantee that economic and trade activities between the two countries will go on as usual amid deteriorating relations, since economic interdependence between China and Australia is not high.      China's trade with some countries continues to move forward despite political frictions. For instance, China and Japan have strengthened economic and trade cooperation in spite of their historical issues; China and the US have maintained close economic ties amid political tensions; and China's trade and investment with India continues to grow, accompanied by frequent disputes over various issues. Japan plays an important role in the Asian industrial chain, to which China has attached great importance. A US-China decoupling is unrealistic given their huge economic scales. And India's promising market potential is highly valued by China.      None of the above-mentioned situations are relevant to China-Australia relations. For China, Australia does not represent a big market and is not irreplaceable in terms of trade.      When the world enters the buyer's market, China has the right to select trading partners that can maximize its interest and shun biased markets that could bring uncertainty to economic exchanges. It is regrettable if some see this as economic coercion. In the business world, it is inevitably to avoid cooperation with a partner that is both hostile and replaceable.      If bilateral relations continue to deteriorate, private Chinese investment, tourism and study in Australia may also be affected, because people can always find alternative destinations in these aspects. Although beef import suspensions and potential barley tariffs are not retaliatory actions from China, many still regard the moves negative signals which will inevitably discourage private investment and exchanges in the future.      A favorable political environment cannot exist without contributions from both sides, which is why we hope Australia will rethink its hostile attitude toward China. If tensions continue on their current trajectory, it would be delusional to expect trade relations to remain on track.

A medical worker of a private clinic prepares to collect swab samples for COVID-19 testing in Moscow, Russia, on April 17, 2020. Russia has registered a daily record of 4,070 COVID-19 cases over the last 24 hours, with the total number reaching 32,008 as of Friday, official data showed. (Sputnik via Xinhua)            A deterioration of the coronavirus pandemic in Russia, which catapulted the nation into second place in number of infections, is reversing progress by many Chinese businesses as COVID-19 outbreak ebbed at home, according to a Russian trade dealer in Yiwu, East China's Zhejiang Province.                Business activity saw a conspicuous uptick at the beginning of April when the disease was shown to be largely contained in China, Hu Yong, partner of a Yiwu-based logistics firm that ships Chinese products to Russia, told the Global Times on Wednesday.                In a notable sign of progress, Wuhan - China's hardest-hit city - lifted its stringent lockdown on April 8.                 Hu's firm, which ships cross-border e-commerce goods, saw its business rebound to 70 percent of pre-virus levels.  "There was a prevailing atmosphere of optimism [among Chinese businesses] on the back of Russia's seemingly effective virus containment versus virus-ravaged Europe at large,'' he said. Some businesses even planned to invest more in Russia.                However, a continued sharp rise in confirmed cases in Russia since late April has brought activity to a new standstill, including for Hu's company.                 At present, its operations - including shipments of anti-virus items - are only running at about 40 percent of pre-pandemic levels, Hu said, and general trade between the two countries has fared even worse.                Russia added 10,028 confirmed cases on Wednesday, bringing its total infections to 242,271, second only to the US.                For Dongjin Group, based in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, one of the largest foreign owners of farms in Russia, the situation is like adding insult to injury.                 "The epidemic has had a huge impact on our soybean farming in Russia's Far East," Zhang Dajun, chairman of Dongjin Group, told the Global Times on Wednesday.                 Chinese technicians previously played a big part in ensuring farming, but their entry into Russia has been banned amid efforts to control the virus. Their remote supervision has been less effective, Zhang said, estimating that the company's soybean harvest in Russia will halve this year.                 Dongjin's soybean planting area in the Far East totaled less than 500,000 mu last year. The company's soybean harvest, affected by local floods, came in at roughly 40,000 tons in 2019, according to Zhang.                With uncertainty lingering over Russia's virus containment, Chinese businesses need to find their own solutions.                Hu's company, with operations in Yiwu, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, is shifting toward home turf, tapping into livestreaming commerce, which is all the rage in Chinese marketplace.                Chinese companies in Russia are contemplating the future of their business operations in the post-pandemic era, keeping an eye on cross-border virtual markets and weighing the challenges of surviving a digitalized world, Zhou Liqun, president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Russia, told the Global Times in a recent interview.                 Some US, German and French firms are putting more money into Russian market, where they are investing and creating jobs, especially in cross-border e-commerce and courier services.

POTTSVILLE — Backing down, at least temporarily, from their plan to shift Schuylkill County to the yellow phase of the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, commissioners voted Wednesday to remain in the red phase until they hear from Gov. Tom Wolf and the state Department of Health.

"It's a challenge for the government to devise policies to kick-start the economic activities and bring down the budget deficit within the desired limits that might escalate to over 9 percent of GDP for the outgoing fiscal year,” he said and added that the rising debt was problematic but the recent decrease in interest rate and getting concessionary loans would help us to reduce the debt burden. When asked about the FBR’s tax collection target of Rs5.1 trillion envisaged by the IMF for the next fiscal budget, Dr Shaikh said that the discussions with the IMF were an ongoing process and the Fund was very supportive for stimulus package announced by the government in the post COVID-19 situation. The construction package, he said, was aimed at boosting the economic activities as the fixed tax was introduced, capital gains tax on one housing unit was abolished and the source of income would not be asked. “We will have to generate taxes but it will be done without suffocating the economy,” the finance adviser to PM added.


  Shaikh said that the government would have to reduce excessive regulations because it increased the cost of doing business. He said that oil on deferred payment from friendly countries contributed to small portion of our total import bill of energy requirements such as POL products and LNG. The hedging of POL prices would be taken into account with cost attached to insurance. The option will be exercised to move ahead with hedging of 15 percent of total import bill of POL products, he added. On the question of tax reforms, he said that the country would have to stay on the course on tax reform path as it might not be pursued aggressively in the wake of coronavirus but the country would have to stick to this course of action. When asked about the partial lockdown or complete lockdown, he replied that complete lockdown was not possible keeping in view health, food and other emergency requirements. He said that Pakistan was a poor country and it could not afford shortages of food and other essential items. So the prime minister's direction for smart lockdown has a lot of wisdom, he added. To another question regarding reversal of SRO 1125 on the demand of textile sector for restoring zero rating regime for five export-oriented sectors, the adviser replied that no country could bring prosperity into the lives of people without earning in dollars, so the government provided subsidy to exporters on electricity, gas and loans. The government, he said, also placed automated refunds system for exporters. The government also helped the exporters through market access as the free trade agreement with China was revised, then GSP Plus from EU got extended and whenever our leadership met with top US officials, it always sought market access for exporters. “The toughest decision was taken for bringing domestic sale of textile sector under the tax net,” he said and added that the government did not want a pick and choose policy on taxation issues.


  On the opportunity side of post COVID-19 scenario, he said that there were many missed-out opportunities in the past as the reduced oil prices and incentives for industries, especially for construction sector despite having under the IMF program, could become positive for Pakistan. He said that when this government came into power, the current account deficit was over $20 billion and the rupee was overvalued. He said that Pakistan struck a good programme with the IMF that helped stabilize the economy in the pre Covid-19 situation. But the coronavirus affected the economy badly as it was going to hit exports and remittances negatively. The tax revenues that were expected to touch Rs4.7 or Rs4.8 trillion for the current fiscal year now it might fall to Rs3.9 trillion. The GDP growth rate would contract and might go negative 1.5 percent for the outgoing fiscal against the earlier projection of positive 3 percent. The government unveiled the stimulus package of Rs1,200 billion but now the real worry was to avoid recession on economic front in the future.

However, when Soda proposed this to his Japanese distributor, Tofoo, it cautioned that there may not be any theaters left by then.


  “I realized that if I want to protect myself, I need to protect everybody in the ecosystem of cinema,” he says, “which means the theater, distributor, producers and also the audience.”


  After a meeting with the owner of Tokyo’s Theatre Image Forum, a key venue in the film’s nationwide rollout, Tofoo staff started contacting other cinemas that had been planning to screen “Zero.” A week later, they unveiled a new initiative, Temporary Cinema, which takes the framework of the independent theater circuit and shifts it online.


  Each cinema has its own sales page, on which viewers can pay to watch movies on-demand during a limited release period (the movies themselves are hosted on Vimeo, long the video platform of choice for independent filmmakers). At ¥1,800 per rental, it costs the same as a theater ticket, and proceeds are split equally between the distributor and exhibitor.


  It’s an alternative to the crowdfunding campaigns that have sprung up over the past month or so. Soda’s name is listed among the many filmmakers backing Mini Theater Aid, which recently raised more than ¥275 million (by the time of writing) to support independent cinemas. While acknowledging this is an “amazing” result, Soda worries whether such efforts are sustainable.


  “We have to think about a situation in which this crisis will be prolonged for a year or two,” he says. “In that case, we have to kind of (preserve) this real economy of cinema, where audiences are the ultimate supporters of the whole ecosystem. The Temporary Cinema initiative is one way — probably almost the only way — to keep it going like that.”


  Temporary Cinema launched on April 25 with 47 cinemas signed up. The titles on offer so far include films that had their theatrical runs cut short, though “Zero” was the first to go straight to streaming.


  Soda admits it was a painful choice.


  “I always make films to be watched in a movie theater; that’s my prime goal and motivation. If I don’t have that, I don’t know if I want to make films,” the filmmaker says. “Watching movies in a movie theater is almost like a ritual: to confirm that we are social animals, to feel that we are connected. So for me to (choose) to release it online was a pretty tough decision. But at the same time, it is a decision for us to be able to go _back_ to the movie theaters.”


  The outpouring of support for the Mini Theater Aid campaign is testament to the enduring appeal of Japan’s independent cinemas. They may no longer enjoy the cultural clout they had in the 1990s, but they have continued to survive in the margins, offering a much-needed alternative to the monolithic fare served at multiplex chains.


  Soda concedes that most people will probably watch his films in other formats — on DVD, TV or online — but he sees something unique in the theatrical experience.


  “There is a reason why ‘cinema’ also means movie theaters,” he says. “It’s synonymous, right? If cinema is not in movie theaters, it's something else.”


  “Zero” returns to the scene of Soda’s 2009 sophomore feature, “Mental,” which focused on an outpatient mental health clinic in Okayama. The clinic’s founder, Dr. Masatomo Yamamoto, was a pioneer in the world of Japanese psychiatry, and led a push to unlock mental hospitals in the 1960s.


  When Soda heard that Yamamoto was set to retire just shy of his 82nd birthday, he and Kashiwagi “quickly decided to do a sequel.” He had already planned a trip to Japan at the same time to promote his 2018 film “Inland Sea,” which made the logistics easier.


  “That’s the beauty of it,” he says, describing how his “observational films” come into being. “If I try to go out and get it, it’s almost impossible. But when something is kind of coming to you, all I do is just receive it and keep going with the flow.”

As a precaution, Hanratty’s doctor prescribed medication in advance, but once he went back home, the symptoms worsened, especially a fever.  


  When Hanratty called his doctor on a Monday morning, she told him to come by the office — pajamas and all — but remain in the car. His temperature was up to 103.1, and his oxygen level had gone from what was a normal 96 to a more alarming 85.


  “She called the ambulance right there and said, ‘You’re going to the hospital!’ ” recalled Hanratty, who had previously worked in New York City but resided in Connecticut and was taken to Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital.


  A six-day stay there had him in complete isolation other than with his doctor and attending nurse, but he described the health-care workers there “spectacular.”


  At age 72, going through double pneumonia and having given up smoking only three years earlier at the urging of daughter Erin (son Conor played along Notre Dame’s offensive line from 2011-14), Hanratty was in a high-risk group.


  “The biggest thing was the fever,” he said. “They had four blankets on me and I was lying in bed shivering. Even if I was able to walk, I couldn’t have walked out of my room … It was a lonely area, but it was an area where you wanted to be because you did not want to infect anybody else.”


  The combination of getting started on the medication in the virus’ infancy stage, quitting smoking a few years earlier and the quick action to get to the hospital helped save him.


  Hanratty lost 16 pounds during his stay — “a great diet, but I don’t recommend it to anybody,” he joked — before getting transported back home in an ambulance. A second reality soon hit home when he realized he was too weak to walk the flight of stairs to his bedroom.


  “They had to carry me up the steps to the room where they had the oxygen set up,” Hanratty said. “It’s a harrowing experience, it’s something you don’t want to go through, that’s for sure.”


  Today he is ambulatory again and in good spirits, but remains highly wary.


  “We’re getting nice weather now, people want to get outside, want to go to the beaches, want to have their parties, want to go to sporting events — you really have to stay away and stick with this thing,” Hanratty said.


  “We have this good comeback they’re talking about every day now on television. You really have to stay diligent about this and keep your distance, wear your mask, wear your gloves, because this is not going away anytime soon.


  “Until we get a vaccine — which I don’t predict and I don’t think anybody predicts it’s going to be before January — we really have to be careful.”

A Lockport building inspector issued a formal violation notice to the premises on May 8, following two prior verbal warnings for consumption on the premises. The SLA issued additional charges to the bar for the May 8 incident. On May 12, the Lockport Building Inspection Department issued a closure order for violating the governor’s executive order and for having a defective fire system.
 “This licensee received repeated warnings and chose to ignore them, causing an unnecessary and completely avoidable risk to patrons, police and the community,” said SLA Chairman Vincent Bradley. “While we’re grateful for the majority of businesses who are adhering to these essential measures in the face of this unprecedented health crisis, it should be crystal clear the SLA will not hesitate to take immediate actions to protect the public health and safety.”
 The State Administrative Procedure Act authorizes a state agency to summarily suspend a license when the agency finds that public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action. When the SLA summarily suspends a license, it also serves a notice of pleading alleging one or more disciplinary violations. In invoking a summary suspension, the liquor authority deemed the violation to be sufficiently serious upon initial review to warrant an immediate suspension. The SLA’s decision to summarily suspend a license is not a final determination on the merits of the case. The licensee is entitled to an expedited administrative law hearing before an administrative law audge. An order of summary suspension remains in effect until such time as it is modified by the SLA or a reviewing court.

As the Governor has said, public health is a team sport. We all have to be a part of the solution if we are going to be successful. So far, we’ve been a great team. Eighty six percent of Wisconsinites agreed with the decision to close schools and businesses, and by and large, most of us are staying safer at home. Those efforts have been successful and the curve has flattened. The challenge now is that if we move too quickly to lift the Safer at Home guidelines, or if people start to ignore them, we will undo all the success we’ve made so far and we will reset the clock.

ONE WOMAN has been working around the clock so Roma residents have the opportunity to dip their toes in the water again as of Saturday.                          Roma pool manager, Stacey Robertson said she had mixed emotions with the announcement last week that public pools were able to reopen as of this weekend, for a maximum of 10 people at a time.             Ms Robertson is closing in on a 70 hour week to ensure the facilities will be ready for Roma residents keen to hit the water again this Saturday.             “That’s why a lot of pools won’t be opening until the following Friday as we’ve had less than a week to prepare our facilities, make sure our water has been tested, have risk assessments done and ensure we have staff ready,” she said.             “The other facilities managers are excited for me as they’re saying that I will be one of the first, if not the first in Australia to reopen.            “While it’s a lot of work, I’m very excited to be opening the facilities again, I do this because I love it.”            Ms Robertson has currently been stacking shelves at Woolworths to keep her afloat financially while the pool has been closed, a job she will continue to do at night in these uncertain times.            “As soon as this all started happening, I was applying for jobs. I wanted to look ahead and make sure I’d be covered,” she said             “I haven’t had a lot of jobs where I had Super put away, so I needed to make sure I could pay my bills.            “Sleep isn’t my priority at the moment. You don’t know whether they will backflip and close everything again, so I need to make sure I have a job to go to.            “I’ve been lucky because I’ve been really supported by other business owners in these times who have been sending me amazing texts with something personal to me. It’s the positivity I need to keep me going.”            Ms Robertson also has been dipping into her own savings to ensure one staff member could remain hired, something she is still yet to see a cent from the government for.             “I need that backup for book work or to work after hours to get cleaning done, sort out paperwork and things like that,” she said.            “I’ve received nothing – for the first six weeks, I was paying one employee full time wage at quite a high rate and that’s come out from my savings and that’s why I had to think about what I was going to do for work in the mean time.”            Ms Robertson said she has relied on the community to ensure that social distancing and common sense is being applied to make it a safe environment for all.            “I’m asking that if come down with any illness, not to come in,” she said.            “The community cannot afford for me to get sick as that means the pool will have to shut again.”            Anyone who would like to book an hour time slot for the pool can contact Stacey on 0428226271.            Ms Robertson is asking those with season passes to bring it in a snaplock bag, to shower at home as only one toilet in each bathroom will be unlocked and upon arrival, abide by social distancing until invited in.             Keep an eye out on the Facebook page for further updates.                                                                                                             0

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. military offered condolences Thursday to Iran over a friendly fire incident in the Islamic Republic that killed 19 of its troops, identifying the weapon used in the incident as an anti-ship cruise missile.


  Iranian authorities on Monday said that a missile struck the Iranian navy vessel Konarak near the port of Jask, some 1,270 kilometers (790 miles) southeast of Tehran in the Gulf of Oman. Authorities said the Konarak was too close to a target and was accidentally hit Sunday in an incident that also wounded 15 troops.


  In a statement, Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said the force offered “our sincere condolences to the Iranian people for the tragic loss of life.” However, Urban also criticized the training for taking place so close to the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil passes.


  “While we are troubled that this mishap occurred in such close proximity to a high-traffic international shipping lane and at a time when most of the region’s focus is on the fight against COVID-19, the unnecessary loss of life is regrettable,” he said.


  Tensions had been expected to rise after Iran’s government overcame the initial chaos that engulfed its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In April, the U.S. accused Iran of conducting “dangerous and harassing” maneuvers near American warships in the northern Persian Gulf. Iran also had been suspected of briefly seizing a Hong Kong-flagged oil tanker just before that.


  President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers two years ago, launching a maximum pressure campaign against Iran that has repeatedly pushed the arch-rivals to the verge of conflict.


  Analysts have warned regional tensions will likely increase again. This week also marks the year anniversary of attacks on oil tankers near the strait that the U.S. blamed on Iran.

Ten percent had been used as an example before Rowland responded, “If I am cutting 10 percent of a $6 million budget, I am cutting $600,000.” He added that historically, when budgets come into question, the first suggestion is to cut employees, but at this current time, doing so would not be possible as they are needed now more than ever.
 Bair noted that the federal government has announced a stimulus program for state and local governments but the projected numbers would be nowhere near enough to cover any real loss as the proposed $1.5 trillion had Bingham County listed at receiving under $5,000. Since the original proposal, the number has doubled to $3 trillion, rounding the expected amount to reach $9,000. “It’s going to take a lot more than that,” stated Bair as he explained his concerns for the current budget.
 Commissioner Jennifer Lewis suggested a combination of ideas; rather than a flat percentage across the board, she suggested that they examine the budget for areas that could handle a cost reduction for the year and utilize these areas. “Models show that doing across-the-board reduction tends to cripple larger businesses and departments,” Lewis explained.
 The commission did not take action on this item, but rather used it as a starting point for research into future budget cuts that may become necessary as the phase process continues.

Trump’s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ’s decision to drop the Flynn case put the “rule of law at risk.” He also criticized the Trump White House’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.


  Biden’s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign’s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.


  Though Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He’s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.


  But the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he’s told advisers he’s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.


  Biden’s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.


  A recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.


  Obama’s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light.

An aide to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said after the vote that she would have supported the amendment if she had been present — meaning it would have passed. Murray was in her home state and will be in the Senate for Thursday’s vote, said the aide, who declined to be identified and was granted anonymity to share the senator’s thinking.


  Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a think tank, said it was striking that the amendment failed by only one vote. He said the vote total would have been “inconceivable” five years ago.


  “It suggests a sea change in attitudes” following revelations in problems with how the FBI has used its secret surveillance powers, Sanchez said. “It goes to the sort of collapse in trust in the intelligence community to deploy these authorities in a restrained way.”


  The second amendment, by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would boost third-party oversight to protect individuals in some surveillance cases. It was adopted 77-19.


  If the Senate passes the legislation with the Lee and Leahy amendment intact, the bill would then have to go back to the House for approval instead of to the president’s desk for signature.


  A third amendment, by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a longtime skeptic of surveillance programs, is expected to be considered Thursday before a final vote. Paul's amendment would require the government to go to a traditional federal court, instead of the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to get a warrant to eavesdrop on an American.

Republicans in the state, like their counterparts in swing states Michigan and Wisconsin, say they are sticking up for desperate people. But they are also jockeying to ensure that Democratic governors, rather than Trump, take the blame.


  “Tom Wolf is going to be as much on the ballot as much as the president, the Legislature and Congress for his handling of this, but he’s going to be judged not just by Republicans but by Democrats and independents,” said Lawrence Tabas, chairman of Pennsylvania's Republican Party.


  For Democrats who have stood by Wolf, that’s just fine right now. Polls show that the public has generally embraced how Wolf — who easily won reelection in 2018 — has managed the crisis.


  A Washington Post-Ipsos poll released Tuesday found that more than 2 in 3 people surveyed from April 27 to May 4 approve of how Wolf has handled the outbreak. Trump's approval nationally in the same poll was much lower, at 43%.


  When Trump visits Thursday, he'll head to the politically moderate Allentown area to tour a medical products distribution center. He did particularly well in the area in the 2016 election, when his narrow win in Pennsylvania helped vault him to the White House.


  Since then, Republicans lost the area's congressional seat for the first time in two decades, and Allentown, with highways connecting it to New Jersey and New York City, has become one of Pennsylvania's coronavirus hot spots.

The second planned story follows female character Sri Asih, who has the strength of 250 men and leads a pack of other superheroes.             The film, based on a 1954 comic book, is being produced by female director Upi Avianto.             Other characters in the pipeline include Mandala, a machete-wielding warrior who can destroy objects without even touching them, and Si Buta Dari Gua Hantu, which tells of a blind martial arts fighter and his pet monkey sidekick.             "I never knew Indonesia had all these superhero characters until Gundala," said film buff Septian Dwi Putri.             "And I didn't think Indonesia could have a proper superhero movie with decent script. The special effects weren't bad either." However with swathes of Indonesia on lockdown because of the COVID-19 virus, the process has ground to a halt says production manager Imansyah Lubis, adding that crews are unable to meet, shooting sites are closed, and even buying or renting equipment raises hygiene issues.             - Pleasing die-hard fans - Prior to the pandemic, Indonesia's film industry had been on the ascent after hitting a low point in the 1990s, when there were almost no local productions.             But as the country of 260 million sees its middle class expand and incomes rise there is growing interest in cinema.             The sector logged a record 50 million ticket sales last year.             But international blockbusters remain the big draw, and local film-makers admit it is difficult to compete with Hollywood's vast finances.             "Gundala" was shot in just 52 days and cost around $2.0 million.             The most recent Marvel film "Avengers: Endgame" had a budget of more than $350 million, while DC Comics "Joker", for which Joaquin Phoenix won the Oscar for Best Actor, is estimated to have cost more than $55 million to make.             "It is extremely difficult to make because of the budget and human resources limitations," Anwar says.             But despite this, and the challenges of the novel coronavirus, he insists "we are in the golden age of cinema".             "Gundala" grossed $4.7 million at cinemas nationally, more than doubling its production budget and a worldwide release will bring further revenues.             Still, mainstream success will mean winning over people like Iron Man fan Disna Harvens.            "I was honestly sceptical at first, but I didn't find it cringe-worthy," he said after watching "Gundala".            "As a die-hard fan of superhero movies, I hope I'll live long enough to see all the Indonesian superhero movie instalments."

“This is very complicated,” Mayor Benjamin Ver of a town in the typhoon's path told The Associated Press by telephone.


  Far-flung Jipapad is prone to landslides and flooding. The town in Eastern Samar province is surrounded by mountains and planked by two rivers that often swell in storms. The only evacuation centers for its 8,000 villagers are a gymnasium and the town hall where residents could be sheltered from the typhoon. Ver, who also is the town’s only doctor, said he has secured enough face masks to protect his villagers from the virus in the town hall when the typhoon hits.


  Observing social distancing “is almost impossible” if all the villagers are cramped in the town hall, but Ver said he would see what else can be done.


  Jipapad and the whole of Eastern Samar, a province of half a million people, fortunately remain free of coronavirus infections unlike neighboring regions, provincial Gov. Ben Evardone said. All emergency shelters have been turned into quarantine facilities with medical equipment in case of outbreaks but may have to be rearranged back into evacuation centers if large numbers of people need shelter, Evardone told The AP.


  Northern Samar provincial Gov. Edwin Ongchuan said he has asked for twice the usual number of school buildings to be turned into typhoon shelters to accommodate about 80,000 residents who were being forcibly evacuated from high-risk coastal villages.


  “If we used 10 school buildings before, we now need 20 to accommodate the evacuees with social distancing,” Ongchuan said.


  The government weather agency warned that “along with large swells, this storm surge may cause potentially life-threatening coastal inundation” and added that sea travel would be dangerous in regions expected to be battered by Vongfong, a Vietnamese word for wasp.


  Metropolitan Manila will not be hit directly by the storm but may be lashed by strong winds. Officials were advised to remove many medical quarantine tents set up outside hospitals that could be blown away, Malano said.

Last month, the Sindh High Court (SHC) Circuit Bench, Sukkur comprising Justice Shamsuddin Abbasi and Justice Amjad Hussain Sahito rejected the bail pleas of PPP senior leader Syed Khurshid Shah and his son Farukh Shah in the asset beyond means case.


  The bench, however, had granted bail to Bibi Gul Naz and Bibi Talat, wives of Syed Khursheed Shah and his son, Zeerak Shah, and nephew.


  NAB Prosecutor General Syed Asghar Haider filed a petition in the Supreme Court under Article 185(3) of the constitution and prayed to grant leave to appeal against the order passed by the SHC at Sukkur on April 22, 2020 and dismissed the pre-arrest bails granted to the respondents Bibi Gul Naz and Bibi Talat and Zeerka Shah and Syed Khalid Hussain Shah in the interest of justice.


  The anti-graft body prayed to the apex court to call for record and proceedings in the matter from learned high court of Sindh bench at Sukkur and after examining the legality, propriety and correctness of the impugned order, the apex court may be pleased to convert the instant petition into appeal and set aside the order passed on April 22, 2020. It submitted that the respondent Syed Zeerakh Khursheed Shah is one of the accused in NAB reference in the case titled State verses Syed Khursheed Shah and others was granted bail before his arrest by the Sindh High Court, Sukkur bench by holding that the NAB is investigating from year 2008 while property transferred in the name of the respondent in the year 2005 hence case of further inquiry and role be determined at trial which is against the law and facts as the respondent/accused is benamidar/beneficiary owner.


  Therefore, the finding of the court is against the law and facts and not sustainable, the NAB contended.


  The anti-graft body submitted that the investigation report reveals that as per inflow and outflow charts the accused persons accumulated to the tune of Rs715,743,751 from the years 2005, 2008 to 2009 and they have got these accumulations of assets from ill-gotten money as they could not justify the said amount.


  It also submitted that the PPP leader and his family also maintained standard of living which does not commensurate with their known sources of income including unexplained banking transactions of Rs371,904,923 and $84,343 and with unexplained cash in hand of Rs4,99,60,829.


  The NAB questioned as to whether the division bench of the SHC, Sukkur bench has passed the impugned order in haste and without applying judicious mind and thus not properly adjudicate upon the matter. “Whether it has failed to consider that there was a sufficient material with the prosecution, which was prima facia connected the respondent with the commission of offence and there appeared reasonable ground to believe that the he was involved in commission of offence of corruption and corrupt practice as benamidar owner and facilitated the accused persons in layering the crime proceed, which is a offence under Section 9(a) of NAB Ordinance as well as Anti-Money Laundering Act”, the NAB further questioned.


  Last year in September, the NAB had arrested PPP leader Khursheed Shah from Islamabad in a case regarding his alleged assets beyond means.

Hadn’t I just heard that some of his key people, including Vice President Mike Pence, had been exposed to the virus and had to self-quarantine? How did this infection get into the White House — one of the most secure locations in the world — anyway?            One of the COVID-19 conundrums is testing. First of all, I don’t believe any country has a reliable test for it. Second, even if a reliable test were available, it would probably take months to administer it to millions of Americans, process the results, and inform those who tested either positive or negative.            But it doesn’t stop there. Word is that those who test positive (possibly millions) would have to be traced. That means recruiting and hiring tens of thousands of workers, training them, and sending them out to find the positives.            Their main job would be to locate those who tested positive and find out with whom they had contact within a few days prior to their test, track those people down, make sure they got tested again, and get a list of people with whom they, too, had recent, close contact. If it doesn’t work that way, the process doesn’t work at all.            If I am correct, right now less than 2% of all Americans have been tested. What that means is that the number of those who test positive is likely to explode exponentially. That would mean plenty of work for the trackers, and it would probably take years to accomplish.            In the meantime, medical researchers have yet to find either a treatment or a vaccine to stop the coronavirus and its ruinous impact on our society — our large and small businesses, restaurants, airlines, hotels, churches, schools, and all aspects of family and community life.            It’s a difficult and confusing question for the experts. What shall we do? We can’t throw in the towel. There is no way out of this but to fight. Winston Churchill is believed to have said, “If you’re going through hell, keep going.” I think that just about sums up where we are right now.            Have a nice day.

ONE WOMAN has been working around the clock so Roma residents have the opportunity to dip their toes in the water again as of Saturday.


  Roma pool manager, Stacey Robertson said she had mixed emotions with the announcement last week that public pools were able to reopen as of this weekend, for a maximum of 10 people at a time.


  Ms Robertson is closing in on a 70 hour week to ensure the facilities will be ready for Roma residents keen to hit the water again this Saturday.


  “That’s why a lot of pools won’t be opening until the following Friday as we’ve had less than a week to prepare our facilities, make sure our water has been tested, have risk assessments done and ensure we have staff ready,” she said.


  “The other facilities managers are excited for me as they’re saying that I will be one of the first, if not the first in Australia to reopen.


  “While it’s a lot of work, I’m very excited to be opening the facilities again, I do this because I love it.”


  Ms Robertson has currently been stacking shelves at Woolworths to keep her afloat financially while the pool has been closed, a job she will continue to do at night in these uncertain times.


  “As soon as this all started happening, I was applying for jobs. I wanted to look ahead and make sure I’d be covered,” she said


  “I haven’t had a lot of jobs where I had Super put away, so I needed to make sure I could pay my bills.


  “Sleep isn’t my priority at the moment. You don’t know whether they will backflip and close everything again, so I need to make sure I have a job to go to.


  “I’ve been lucky because I’ve been really supported by other business owners in these times who have been sending me amazing texts with something personal to me. It’s the positivity I need to keep me going.”


  Ms Robertson also has been dipping into her own savings to ensure one staff member could remain hired, something she is still yet to see a cent from the government for.


  “I need that backup for book work or to work after hours to get cleaning done, sort out paperwork and things like that,” she said.


  “I’ve received nothing – for the first six weeks, I was paying one employee full time wage at quite a high rate and that’s come out from my savings and that’s why I had to think about what I was going to do for work in the mean time.”


  Ms Robertson said she has relied on the community to ensure that social distancing and common sense is being applied to make it a safe environment for all.


  “I’m asking that if come down with any illness, not to come in,” she said.


  “The community cannot afford for me to get sick as that means the pool will have to shut again.”


  Anyone who would like to book an hour time slot for the pool can contact Stacey on 0428226271.


  Ms Robertson is asking those with season passes to bring it in a snaplock bag, to shower at home as only one toilet in each bathroom will be unlocked and upon arrival, abide by social distancing until invited in.

TAUNTON - All the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe needed in order to pay off its $530,000 annual obligation to the city was one month of bingo.


  At least that's what a representative of the tribe allegedly told Taunton's law office in early April -- after City Solicitor David Gay and First Assistant Solicitor Matthew Costa sent a "dispute notice" on March 31 to Mashpee Wampanoag's tribal chairman and gaming president Cedric Cromwell.


  The letter reminded Cromwell that the tribe was more than three months delinquent on its annual payment in lieu of taxes, also known as a PILOT.


  It also stated that the tribe is obligated to meet with city officials within 10 days of receipt of the letter to resolve the problem.

It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.


  The payment in lieu of taxes is due every year by Nov. 10, until such time that the 2012 intergovernmental agreement (IGA) between the city and tribe no longer has legal standing.


  The IGA was signed in anticipation of the development of a tribal resort casino in East Taunton that was to have created more than 2,600 permanent full- and part-time jobs and many hundreds of construction jobs.


  The cost of the project, which was described as ranging anywhere from $600 million to $1 billion, was to have been financed by the Genting Group of Malaysia.


  In a letter dated May 8 read aloud at this week's Tuesday night City Council meeting (held remotely via Zoom), the law office stated that subsequent to sending its March 31 dispute notice the city had agreed to grant the Mashpee Wampanoag an extension until the end of April to pay the $530,720.


  The expectation, the letter states, was that the tribe would be able to raise revenue by opening a bingo hall in Mashpee. The letter further states that the idea never came to fruition as result of the current COVID-19 pandemic.


  The May 8 letter was included in Tuesday night's agenda packet in response to a request by the council on April 28 for an update on the PILOT situation.


  Councilor David Pottier, a longtime opponent of the tribe's proposal for a resort casino, was the only council member who commented Tuesday night on the May 8 letter referring to the tribe's not being able to establish a bingo hall because of the coronavirus pandemic.


  "I find their excuse totally inadequate," Pottier said.


  As part of the 2012 IGA, the tribe, in anticipation of land being placed in trust, delivered $1.5 million after signing the agreement, which also guaranteed the city at least $8 million a year once the casino became operational.


  That has yet to come to pass.


  One year after the federal government agreed to place 151 acres in Taunton and 170 acres in Mashpee in trust as a sovereign Indian reservation, a group of two dozen citizen plaintiffs, in 2016, convinced a U.S. District Court judge that the Department of the Interior had erred.


  This past March the Interior Department ordered all 351 acres be taken out of trust.


  The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe then filed an emergency motion with the District of Columbia's U.S. District Court for a preliminary restraining order and temporary restraining order.


  There's also a bill pending in Washington D.C. designed to permanently restore the 351 acres to in-trust status. The bill passed the House but has yet to be heard in the Senate.


  For the time being the land remains in trust, which means that the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe is legally bound by the IGA to pay its past-due, annual payment in lieu of taxes, according to the city.


  The city's law department says the tribe, dating back to November 2016, has made good on three prior PILOTs.


  The Mashpee Wampanoag since 2012, as per terms of the IGA, has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in infrastructure "mitigation" improvements.


  The most significant payment was $776,000 it gave the city to buy 17 parcels of land near Harts Four Corners -- as part of a $3 million Massachusetts Department of Transportation intersection-improvement project that resulted in new traffic signals, wider travel lanes and new ADA-compliant sidewalks.


  The tribe also paid for installation of a new water line running down Stevens Street in East Taunton to the entrance of what was supposed to be the resort casino site.


  The delinquency of the tribe's 2019 payment in lieu of taxes was first laid out in an April 23 letter from the law department to the Taunton City Council, as part of a comprehensive update on the status of the IGA that the council had requested on January 28.


  Included in the letter is a section explaining that three former property owners who were paid for land takings by eminent domain -- as part of the Harts Four Corners project -- are in the process of challenging the amount they were paid and will present their case in Superior Court.


  The April 23 letter states that based on the terms and conditions of the IGA, as well as a separate memorandum of understanding, the tribe is responsible to pay the city for any and all costs that might be incurred in defense of these legal cases.


  City Solicitor David Gay says that if the city were to pursue legal action against the tribe to collect last year's payment in lieu of taxes, it most likely would do so in Superior Court.


  Pottier also made a motion that both the May 8 letter and the original demand-notice letter be posted to the city's website.


  The motion passed by unanimous vote.

On Day 75 of the outbreak, which began on February 29, 159 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total number of infections to 23,401. The highest death toll was 58 lives lost on April 12. Figures reported so far show just one death on Tuesday this week.                         But the National Public Health Emergency Team is satisfied with many of the key indicators of the disease.                         There were 64 people with Covid-19 in intensive care beds yesterday and Dr Holohan confirmed that delays in testing turnarounds would not hold back the decision to ease restrictions.                         NPHET will meet today and is expected to give the green light to begin unwinding lockdown.                         However, Dr Holohan warned it wasn’t the time to start throwing “parties and barbecues”. He added: “We will keep monitoring that situation all the way up to Monday.

Aggressive testing and contact tracing are back in full swing in South Korea, as new chains of coronavirus infections continue to pop up sequentially after an outbreak linked to nightclubs and bars in Itaewon, central Seoul.                            Health authorities added four new clubs and bars -- MADE, Pink Elephant, The Fountain and Pistil -- to the list of locations where mass transmissions are believed to have occurred. That raises the number of establishments in Seoul’s popular nightlife spot under the scrutiny of quarantine officials to nine, with the previous five being King Club, Trunk Club, Club Queen, Soho and H.I.M. The mass transmissions are thought to have occurred April 24 through May 6.                            The scaled-up investigation comes as authorities say the nightclub cluster probably has multiple epicenters. Cases have been detected with no apparent correlation to the cluster’s first identified patient or anyone in that chain of contacts.                            “We are collecting lists of visitors and taking necessary measures on the nine sites for the possibility that they could be infection sources or that the places could be exposed to the virus by those who were infected,” said Jung Eun-kyeong, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                            The total number of infections traced to clubs and bars in the popular nightlife area of Itaewon had increased by 17 to 119 in the last 24 hours as of noon Wednesday, according to the KCDC. Seoul reported 26 cases linked to the Itaewon cluster.                            Of the 119 patients, 76 were visitors to Itaewon and 43 had come into close contact with them.                            Efforts to contain the virus’s spread look set to expand beyond Itaewon, as cases have also been linked to bars in other nightlife meccas in Seoul. Outbreaks are suspected at Damotori 5 bar in Sinchon and at another bar near Hongik University, Jung said.                            Earlier, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said the government had set a goal of finding all Itaewon visitors within this week to carry out coronavirus tests, urging those who remained unresponsive to messages from the authorities to come forward.                            “For the last time, I request that they report voluntarily. We don’t have much time left to wait,” he said.                             Spurred by the government’s repeated requests and anonymous testing, the country conducted 15,030 tests on Wednesday alone, the highest figure since March 31.                            To protect the privacy of those who visited clubs that cater mainly to LGBT clientele, Jung said the government would update its guidelines on the public disclosure of information about new COVID-19 cases.                            It will direct municipal governments to issue separate notices for the disclosure of certain places of mass infections and for patients’ minute-by-minute movements.                            Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said foreign nationals accounted for 11 percent of the 10,905 people who used cellphones connected to cell towers near five Itaewon clubs and bars between April 24 and May 6 within the time frame in question -- 1,210 people.                            According to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, of 53 native English speakers who work as language teachers at schools in Seoul and who were found to have visited Itaewon, six had gone to entertainment establishments there. Four received negative results while two were waiting for their results.                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

One of the issues facing the Health and Safety Executive is its capacity to deal with a large volume of complaints.


  It has 40 inspectors, of whom 28 are able to go out on site visits.


  Chief Executive Robert Kidd told an assembly committee recently that in seven weeks it had fielded 991 complaints, of which it had had to address two- thirds, passing the rest to councils.


  He said his staff had worked "tirelessly" to mitigate risk in businesses which had kept working during the lockdown.


  He said this was particularly the case in food production where "without sensible interpretation it could have meant the closure of essential food production in Northern Ireland, which was a very real risk in the early days"
