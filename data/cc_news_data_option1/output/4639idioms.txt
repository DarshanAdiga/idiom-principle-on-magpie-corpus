 PARIS, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Five years after Islamist killers struck in postwar France's deadliest attack, its Prime Minister on Friday paid tribute to the victims, with the country again on high alert following a new wave of ideologically driven violence.
 The Nov. 13, 2015 rampage by jihadist suicide bombers and gunmen killed 130 people, wounded hundreds and left deep scars on the nation's psyche.
 Premier Jean Castex laid wreaths at venues across the capital that were hit that night, the first outside the Stade de France where the coordinated bloodletting began during a soccer match attended by then president Francois Hollande.
 The attackers also targeted cafes, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall, sites that have been under close police watch in the run-up to Friday's anniversary.
 France is back on its highest security alert following, since September, a stabbing outside the former offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine, the beheading of a history teacher who had shown his class cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad and a fatal attack in a church in Nice.
 Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said France faced a double-edged threat. "From outside, people sent from abroad, and a grave internal threat, people who are amongst us, our enemies within," he told Franceinfo radio on Friday.
 After the Nice attack, Darmanin said France was engaged in a war against Islamist ideology. President Emmanuel Macron pledged to stand firm against assaults on French values and freedom of belief - comments that led to anti- French protests in some Muslim countries.
 There were 14 attacks carried out on French soil between 2013 and 2019, according to the Centre for the Analysis of Terrorism. Scores more failed or were foiled.
 SHIFTING THREAT
 While the security risk facing France has not diminished, the nature of the threat has changed, security experts say.
 It no longer lies so much with cells of foreign or homegrown militants groomed by Islamic State and other jihadist networks, but rather with "lone wolf" attackers often unknown to spy agencies and inspired by Islamist propaganda online.
 "The threat is increasingly difficult to pin down," said one former senior intelligence official.
 "We know how to monitor and infiltrate organised networks and radicalised mosques. But we remain quite helpless when confronted by individuals."
 The Chechen teenager who decapitated teacher Samuel Paty on Oct. 16 had a record of juvenile delinquency but was not among the 20,000 people inside France on the country's security watchlist.
 Nor was he the first to blindside the intelligence services.
 His weapon, a single blade, also contrasted sharply with the arsenal of suicide bomb vests and automatic rifles used by the Paris attackers.
 "There is no longer the need for groups like Islamic State to organise attacks," said jihadism expert Asiem el Difraoui.

“The latest medical checks have only confirmed what I already knew and, whilst it’s frustrating, the simple fact is that I’m just not ready to return and it’s the right call to sit it out.”
 In his absence, Thompson has slipped to third in the Jack Sears standings and he admitted it was a shame that he was unable to go for the crown.
 “Sadly there is nothing we can do about it,” he added.
 “If there is one positive thing, then at least I’ve had to miss races behind closed doors, as it would have been a lot more difficult if I knew I had fans and sponsors there cheering me on trackside.
 “My focus now turns to next season and working towards putting a deal in place for 2021. My sponsors are excited about the future and I’m working hard on being ready to go when the new season comes around.”
 He will be replaced at Brands by Ethan Hammerton, who also stood in for him at Snetterton.
 Hammerton said: “It’s a shame for Bobby that he isn’t able to race again this weekend, but I’m obviously thrilled that the team has asked me to continue in the car for Brands Hatch.
 “It shows they are happy with the job I did at Snetterton and I’m really looking forward to the season finale.”

 The offense is in the dumps, and coach Matt Nagy basically has declined to say much in regard to who will be calling plays against the Vikings. In the offseason, the Bears had to hope they could ascend to the middle of the pack on that side of the ball.

Football marries analytics  
 Last Sunday's 24-19 nail-biter between the Steelers and Cowboys perfectly exemplified how analytics should not be used as a rule but as a tool.
 Up by five with less than a minute left, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin opted against trying a 33-yard field goal and instead attempted a fourth-down conversion that failed. The three points would have pushed the Steelers lead to eight and meant, at worst, they would have gone to overtime. But Tomlin saw the threat of a blocked kick as introducing a different scenario into the fold.
 "We had struggled so much with our field goal group early in the game, I just didn't feel good about it," Tomlin said after the game. "They were beating us to the punch pretty much for the better part of the day in special teams. We missed an extra point and they blocked a field goal attempt … I had just seen enough of their dominance in [special] teams."

I will be the first to recommend to the authorities to scrap the entire squad if we cannot have players prepared to strict discipline and training.”

The actor stated that it was a satirical movie, it was over the top, but Cohen got her thinking about her character - what it would be like, living this life, even if it was fake. Bakalova mentioned that he would be like, 'would you be happy if people treated you this way,' and asked her if she would be okay if the whole purpose of her life was to get married and live in a cage.

Beyond Meat’s third-quarter sales growth slowed and the company on Monday posted a US$19.3 million net loss, partly due to higher expenses from retooling its supply chain to meet grocery demand earlier this year, and what it described as less “retail stockpiling” during the quarter.
 Spice maker McCormick's costs have shot up in the last two quarters and are expected by Refinitiv to rise even more in the current one.
 “I'd say that today, our supply chain is so much more resilient than it was at the beginning of the year,” McCormick's Chief Executive Lawrence Kurzius told Reuters in October.
 Kurzius said the company has had to de-prioritize products like some gluten- free spices in favor of popular comfort ingredients like pumpkin-pie spice and taco seasoning. “I'm not trying to tempt fate by saying that, but I think McCormick, as well as our industry as a whole, is in a much better place.”
 Next month, Prego pasta sauce owner Campbell Soup is expected to report an increase in operating expenses, its first in five quarters, according to Refinitiv. Campbell - which has sacrificed some products to focus on more popular ones, such as chicken or tomato soup - spent more on sanitation and labor in its most recent quarter and invested US$40 million in a new Goldfish cracker plant in September.
 Campbell CEO Mark Clouse told Reuters the company has upped outsourcing of production of soup and some snacks to third-party manufacturers – or “co- packers” - to meet any unexpected demand quickly.
 “There will be enough soup for the winter,” he said. “You’ll see a shelf that feels fuller than what you might have seen back in March as we’ve worked closely with retailers to make sure we get assortments right.”
 Other companies grappling with higher manufacturing costs include Procter & Gamble , which has been making Charmin products at record levels this year and has hired more workers to keep lines running 24/7.
 Rival Kimberly-Clark , the world’s biggest toilet paper maker, is also seeing higher manufacturing and distribution costs, while Clorox said this month that it is “investing significantly” in third-party suppliers and getting products to retailers faster.
 Companies including Kraft Heinz are also running factories 24/7 and making bigger, more affordable pack sizes of products.
 “Affordability is a rising concern, which should be a benefit to those companies that are fast to adapt,” said Miguel Patricio, CEO of Kraft Heinz which is seeing more demand for 12-pack Mac & Cheese and bigger bottles of ketchup.
 Patricio told Reuters Kraft Heinz has increased U.S. third-party manufacturing by 20per cent, and its own production by 20-25per cent. Kellogg said the company has plans to invest in “significant capacity” as it enters 2021.
 McCormick’s Kurzius said it, too, struck more deals with co-packers, changed factory shifts to run 24/7 and hired 400 U.S. manufacturing workers to increase capacity. “We've added the equivalent of a whole new manufacturing center to meet this year’s surge in demand,” Kurzius said.

It's that season! Yes, it's the holiday season, but it's also the "how do I get rid of the turkey leftovers" season. The recipes I'm sharing today are Chez Lolly-approved by family and friends.      LITTLE GOBBLER CROISSANT SANDWICHES   One of my social media friends told me about a sandwich that her mama served their family after Thanksgiving. It sounded amazing to me, and I decided to try it out for our family. We all love it!      • Croissants (cut in half lengthwise)   • Cream cheese (I used the whipped version so it will be easy to spread)   • Sliced turkey   • Cranberry sauce      Spread a liberal serving of cream cheese on each half of the croissant.      Pile on the turkey slices and then spoon over as much or little cranberry sauce as you'd like. Top with that other half of the croissant. Refrigerate until ready to serve.      TURKEY AND SAUSAGE GUMBO   It's a tradition in our family to have gumbo on hand for the busy weekend following Thanksgiving. Have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go. Once the roux is ready, you'll add all the veggies at one time.   • 12 to 14 cups turkey stock (preferably homemade)   • 1 cup flour   • 1 cup vegetable oil   • 1 large yellow onion, chopped   • 3 ribs celery, chopped   • 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped   • 2 teaspoons chopped garlic   • 16 ounces package Cajun-style smoked sausage, diced and browned   • 2 to 3 cups chopped turkey   • 1 to 2 tablespoons Cajun or Creole seasoning   • 2 bay leaves   • Cooked white rice   • Chopped parsley   • Thinly sliced green onions      In a large Dutch oven (7 quarts), bring turkey stock to a gentle simmer.      In a large cast-iron skillet, add the flour and oil. Turn heat to medium high and, continually stirring, begin to make the roux. You must stir the mixture constantly so it won't burn.      When the roux reaches the color of peanut butter, add the onions, celery and bell pepper all at once and stir. The vegetables will cool the roux so that it stops cooking, and the heat from the roux will soften the veggies.      Lower the heat to medium low and let the vegetables cook for 4 to 5 minutes, frequently stirring. Add the garlic and let cook another minute or so.      Add the vegetables to the simmering stock. Next, add in the browned sausage and turkey. Stir in the Creole seasoning and add the bay leaves.   Bring the gumbo up to a gentle simmer and let cook for an hour or so. Remove the bay leaves before serving over cooked rice. Garnish with parsley and/or green onions.      CREAMY TURKEY AND WILD RICE SOUP   This recipe, courtesy of Food and Wine, was adapted from a chicken and wild rice recipe into a turkey and wild rice recipe.      • 4 tablespoons unsalted butter   • 2 carrots, cut into inch pieces   • 3 celery ribs, cut into inch pieces   • 1 medium onion, chopped   • 2 garlic cloves, minced   • 1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme   • Salt   • Pepper   • 1/4 cup all-purpose flour   • 1 cup wild rice (5 ounces)   • 2 quarts chicken stock or low-sodium broth   • 2 cups of water   • 4 cups bite-size pieces of roasted turkey (or chicken)   • 1 cup heavy cream   • Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish      Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.      Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring, until evenly coated and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the wild rice to the saucepan and gradually stir in the stock and water.      Bring to a boil, then simmer over moderately low heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.      Add the turkey (or chicken) and simmer, occasionally stirring, until the wild rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve.

Polish bishops defended St. John Paul II on Friday against evidence that he rejected reports that ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick slept with his seminarians, seeking to salvage a papal legacy that has been badly tarnished by his inaction on clergy sexual abuse.
 The head of the Polish bishops conference, Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki, said in a statement that John Paul had been “cynically deceived” by McCarrick as well as other U.S. bishops.
 It was the Polish bishops’ first response to the publication this week of the Vatican’s two-year investigation into McCarrick, which implicated John Paul and his secretary in covering up McCarrick’s sexual abuse.
 The criticism of John Paul’s legacy has hit a nerve in overwhelmingly Catholic Poland, where its most famous native son has long been held up as model for his role in bringing about the fall of communism and for keeping the faith and national values alive. His legacy, though, has come under increasing scrutiny here and abroad, amid a growing scandal over abusive priests and bishops who covered for them in Poland itself.

With the continued escalation of the COVID-19 virus here in Floyd county, a number of the county’s leaders addressed the public Nov. 12 as area hospitals are “near capacity.”
 On Wednesday, Nov. 12, a live public service address was conducted at Prestonsburg City Hall, via Facebook live, regarding the continued escalation of the COVID-19 virus. The address featured Floyd County Judge-Executive Robbie Williams, Prestonburg Mayor Les Stapleton and Floyd County Health Director Thursa Sloan as they discussed the rise in positive COVID-19 cases here in Floyd County. Last month, Floyd saw its “worst” month regarding cases, Sloan said recently and so far, it looks as though November could be on the same track.
 “We’ve seen a significant increase in our COVID-19 numbers,” Williams said. “Today we have 50 confirmed cases.”
 The reason for the address, according to Williams, is due to officials being recently informed that area hospitals are nearly at capacity.
 “We’re going to ask folks to do as much as they possibly can to stay at home and to not be out unless you absolutely have to,” Williams said. “We’ve had nearly 300 cases this month.”
 Williams said the concern is that as cases increase, with hospitals in the area near capacity and central Kentucky hospitals over capacity, according to Williams, there won’t be enough beds to deal with the amount of COVID-19 patients.
 Starting Nov. 13, Williams said, the Floyd County Court House will be closed until further notice. He added that hopefully it’s only for a few days, but “we have to get a handle on this as much as possible.”
 According to Sloan, the already nearly 300 cases, just in November, is “huge escalation” from what was first being seen in April. As far as the county’s positivity rate, which she said the governor’s office was using for “red counties”, for the last seven days Floyd’s positivity rate was approximately 73.46.
 Sloan said that with positivity rates such as that, Floyd is well past the mark to be within keeping schooling geared towards online instruction.
 Sloan said that the health department is seeing positive cases trending in household and workplace environments.
 “If one person in a workplace gets the virus, we’re seeing six employees, or about 50 percent, of them will get it,” Sloan said. “Same thing with families. I’ve seen households with as many as seven or eight get it, so it’s really scary when you look at those numbers.
 “It’s not just scary it’s concerning,” she added.
 According to Slone, people have done a good job staying within family units, however, with winter months here that strategy is not “working very well.”
 Sloan also addressed the importance of quarantining and added that there’s a difference in quarantining and isolating. She added that if an individual tests positive, they need to find a room away from family members and stay there until their quarantine is up, or family members run a great risk of contracting the virus.
 Sloan said that, with Thanksgiving coming up, the health department is going to be focusing on educating the public on what needs to be happening going forward, because due to the holiday, she expects a lot of issue to arise.
 “We really got to try and educate people on how to try and have the safest Thanksgiving they’ve ever had because times are different and we’re living in a different age,” Sloan said.
 Stapleton said that he didn’t have anything to add regarding Williams’ and Sloan’s comments.
 “What it all boils down to is use common sense,” Stapleton said.” It’s that easy, use common sense.”
 Stapleton did encourage everyone to use a mask and social distance if they have to be in a public setting.
 “This is a problem we all have to deal with. We got to figure out how to do this and we’ll get through it,” Stapleton said. “Because we have a lot of smart people out there and they understand that there’s a problem and they’re going to work with us to fix it.”
 He did add that the city’s administrative offices will be closed and if any individual meeds a license application or need to pay taxes in-person, they can call and set up an appointment where they can speak to someone, socially distanced. There will also be a secure dropbox located outside for individuals to use.
 Sloan concluded the address stating that the health department has been informed regarding a possible vaccine ready for first responders, as early as December.

GEORGIA SENATE: Trump won’t be on the ballot in January as Georgia voters settle two Senate runoffs that will determine who controls the chamber at the start of Biden’s tenure.

A facility set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI vaccine group has exceeded an interim target of raising more than $2 billion to buy and distribute Covid-19 shots for poorer countries, but said it still needs more.
 Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19
 The GAVI alliance said on Friday that the funds for an advance market commitment (AMC) will allow the COVAX facility to buy an initial one billion vaccine doses for 92 eligible countries which would not otherwise be able to afford them.
 "We've seen sovereign and private donors from across the world dig deep and help meet this target," GAVI chief Seth Berkley told reporters, adding that there was an "urgent need" to also finance treatments and diagnostics.
 Berkley said $3 billion was still needed for diagnostics and $6.1 billion for therapeutics by the end of 2020.
   
   
 Another $5 billion will also be needed in 2021 to procure Covid-19 vaccine doses as they come through development and are approved by regulators, GAVI said in a statement.
 US drugmaker Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, who this week said their experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 90% effective in initial trials, had expressed an interest in supplying doses to the COVAX facility, Berkley said.
 "We continue to advance negotiations with a number of manufacturers in addition to those we've already announced who share our vision of fair and equitable distribution of vaccines," he added.

The differences between the Tamil Nadu government and Anna University's vice- chancellor M K Surappa deepened on Friday with the State ordering an enquiry into allegations against Surappa. Retired justice of Madras high court, P Kalaiyarasan has been appointed as the 'inquiry officer' to look into a slew of complaints including financial irregularities and malpractice in exam revaluations, contracts and recruitments during Surappa's tenure. He assumed charge at the Chennai-based public varsity in April 2018.
 "This is surprising, shocking and appalling," said Surappa, speaking to HT. "There is not even a grain of truth in any of those things. I served at IIT (Ropar) Punjab as a director for six years (2009-2015) because of my probity and my integrity; I was appointed to advisory councils. I've lived on those principles. I'm undeterred," he added.
 The principal secretary of the higher education department, Apoorva, issued the government order dated November 11 for the inquiry under provisions of Anna University Act, 1978. It listed six complaints that were received from individuals through the chief minister's special cell and an email petition from a group named 'Save Anna University'.
 The complainants claimed instances of corruption to the tune of Rs 200 crore, forged certificates amongst other issues. One complainant, R Adhikesavan has said that Surappa appointed his daughter to the university by misusing his powers. "Most of these complaints have come through anonymous letters," said Surappa. "The government should have checked with me before sending this letter."
   
   
 The inquiry officer has been asked to look into specific allegations of abuse of official position and scam in the institution's career advancement scheme. All financial transactions in the form of fees, assistance, donations and grants will be probed, said the order. It stated that prima facie the allegations "are serious in nature" prompting the inquiry.
 The inquiry officer has been given powers to use investigating agencies and other government officers. The probe was also free to look at such issues from previous periods and, if allegations were proven, to offer solutions so they don't recur. The committee would have to submit its report in three months.
 The vice-chancellor and the State government were entangled in a controversy after it came to light that Surappa had directly written to the Centre on conferring Institute of Eminence (IoE) status to Anna University. State law minister had termed his action as 'indiscipline'. The BJP's state unit came to Surappa's defence. Concerned that an IoE status would affect the state's existing 69% reservation policy, Tamil Nadu rejected the University Grants Commission's 2018 offer to allot IoE which provides for greater funds and autonomy.

Further investigation revealed the subject to be responsible for multiple property damages of vehicles, docks, and residences in the same area. Due to the subject hallucinating, he was transported to Lake Regional Hospital and later released to the Camden County Correctional Facility.

 That's fair, but I ultimately don't see teams factoring in two third-round draft picks a decade down the road for the reason why they hired a Black pro scout over an equally good white scout.

LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (AP) - Zambia faces a Friday deadline to clear debt owed to external investors who have rejected the country's request for deferral of an overdue $42.5 million interest payment.
 Unless the southern African country pays up by the end of the day, it will become the first African nation to default amid the coronavirus pandemic after repeatedly failing to win a six-month holiday from eurobond holders who account for about $3 billion of Zambia's sovereign debt.
 "While government regrets that the bondholders did not approve the requests made by Zambia in good faith, we remain committed to finding a consensual and collaborative resolution to debt sustainability issues," Zambia's Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
 Many sub-Saharan African countries, from Cameroon to Kenya, have issued eurobonds over the years, amassing debt that is maturing at a time of rising financial burden amid the pandemic.
 Zambia, one of the world's top producers of copper, would become the first African sovereign to default during the pandemic, which has heightened fiscal pressures in low-income countries that don't collect enough revenue to meet all budgetary spending needs.
 How Zambia navigates the situation will be closely monitored by others in the region. African authorities have said they need debt relief in order to focus on urgent public services, including health care.
 Cash-strapped Zambia has long been seen as example of unsustainable debt. A joint analysis by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund reported last year that the country was at high risk of external debt distress.
 Appetite for debt has grown tremendously in Africa as governments launch ambitious public works they believe will underpin growth for years to come. The projects are often funded by Chinese capital and built with Chinese expertise. In turn, China has been keen to exploit Africa´s vast natural resources in countries such as Zambia, which also is a major producer of cobalt.
 Backed by credit from China and other outside sources, Zambian authorities have been spending on everything from highways to airports in projects sometimes tainted by official corruption. Such spending likely will slow down because of pressure to reduce arrears, and there are multiple reports of stalled projects, including a $450 million dam.
 China holds about a third of Africa´s sovereign debt, and there have been concerns that heavily indebted countries could fall into a trap and even lose their sovereignty.
 The World Bank and IMF have announced some relief measures, including freeing up billions in debt payments through the end of 2020, and some African countries have secured more loans from those institutions.
