Nearly eight months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia officials and public- health experts are eying the upcoming winter season with caution amid a recent uptick in positive coronavirus cases and the dual impacts of the flu.
   
 Cases of COVID-19, which had killed 8,156 people by Friday and sickened hundreds of thousands more in Georgia, have declined sharply since a peak in late July when the state averaged more than 3,500 cases per day, according to state Department of Public Health (DPH) data.
   
 But cases have crept back up in recent weeks from a daily average of just under 1,200 cases on Oct. 1 to more than 1,700 cases as of Thursday. The DPH data also shows the state's case positivity rates and hospitalization counts have ticked up over the past few weeks.
   
 Georgia's recent increases mirror a spiking trend of new COVID-19 cases across the U.S. that soared to more than 113,000 nationwide on Thursday - though Georgia's case rates have not risen so steeply as in many other states, said Jose Cordero, an epidemiology professor at the University of Georgia (UGA).
   
 "Right now, we are in an upward trend," Cordero said. "When you have a virus like [COVID-19], you have it not in a single wave but in multiple waves. And that's exactly what we're seeing."
   
 Georgia might even experience back-to-back waves of increasing COVID-19 infections if people abandon masks, social distancing and other safety precautions during the holiday season, said Isaac Fung, an associate professor of epidemiology at Georgia Southern University's Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health.
   
 With cold temperatures not yet present in Georgia, Fung traced the current creep in positive cases largely to people who have disregarded safety measures as the pandemic rolls on without a vaccine likely available until next year.
   
 "If people continue to be relaxed about wearing face masks, we could potentially see a major increase after Thanksgiving and another wave after Christmas," Fung said. "It is certainly a very challenging circumstance for many individuals, especially older age groups."
   
 At the same time, the rate of COVID-19 tests aimed at helping pinpoint where outbreaks occur has declined in Georgia recently, as noted in a White House task force report issued Nov. 1. Fewer tests make it tougher to gauge the true extent of the virus' reach in local communities, the report says.
   
 That knowledge gap could heighten the risk of spreading coronavirus in gathering places like bars or indoor parties, particularly if family and friends sick of being socially separated throw caution to the wind for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, said UGA's Cordero.
   
 "If you have people that you don't know whether they're positive or not, you're going to have more [cases], especially with the asymptomatic spreaders," Cordero said.
   
 State public-health officials and Gov. Brian Kemp have touted boosts in testing availability and turnaround times for several months, after tests were limited and sluggish during the pandemic's early days. Private labs and companies like CVS and Walmart joined the state to start offering tests in May.
   
 But more recently, Georgians preoccupied with rebuilding their businesses, keeping their online-learning kids focused at home and just generally feeling fatigued by the stress and isolation of the pandemic have gone to get tested less often, said Nancy Nydam, a DPH spokeswoman.
   
 "Testing for COVID-19 in Georgia has declined as it has nationally," Nydam said. "There is not one definitive reason for the decline. … [But] it is possible that as we get closer to Thanksgiving and the holidays, we again will see an uptick in demand for testing."
   
 Alongside official testing, UGA Professor Erin Lipp and a student group have been analyzing COVID-19 levels at three Athens wastewater treatment plants since late May to gain a broader picture of the virus' presence in Athens- Clarke County, including among infected people who do not show symptoms.
   
 A dashboard, which depicts the weekly amount of COVID-19 viruses that detach from feces in the county's sewerage system, has shown fluctuating levels of coronavirus in Athens since October, complicating the guesswork for how transmissions might trend in the coming winter months, Lipp said.
   
 "We haven't seen a consistent trend in recent weeks pointing in one direction or another," Lipp said. "But we really need to be aware of the increased possibility of transmission in Athens, even if it's not happening right now."
   
 With such uncertainty, Georgia officials and health experts are pushing to avoid simultaneous outbreaks of COVID-19 and influenza, which combined could hammer local hospitals where doctors and nurses have spent months treating coronavirus patients.
   
 Already, Albany's hard-hit Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in South Georgia is bracing for "another significant and potentially dangerous stage" in the fight against COVID-19, although positive cases and hospitalizations of late have stayed steadily low, said hospital President and CEO Scott Steiner.
   
 "This has been a record-setting week for new COVID-19 cases nationwide as the virus spreads rapidly in many areas where cold weather has arrived," Steiner said Friday. "Once cooler weather comes to Southwest Georgia, and we begin to spend more time indoors, the risk for virus transmission will rise."
   
 Kemp's office said the governor and the state's public-health chief, Dr. Kathleen Toomey, have been checking in regularly with hospitals ahead of the winter season to prepare for any capacity issues resulting from a potential influx of COVID-19 and flu patients.
   
 State emergency-management officials also have "an on-hand supply" of masks, hand sanitizer and other protective gear that "can be deployed at a moment's notice" in the event of an outbreak, said the governor's press secretary, Cody Hall.
   
 "We continue to urge all Georgians to follow best practices and get their flu shot to prevent a 'twindemic' of COVID-19 and the flu," Hall said. "We're also still asking Georgians to do 'Four Things for Fall' to mitigate the spread of COVID-19: Wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance and follow the guidance of public-health officials."
   
 Fung, of Georgia Southern, agrees those habits could help stave off a winter COVID-19 wave. He's been sheltering in his home since March, when the virus first fired across Georgia, and put bluntly the possible consequences for people who ignore distancing and masking practices this holiday season.
   
 "They need to be aware that they may potentially infect their grandparents," Fung said. "If I was in that situation, I would feel very bad."

“We want to encourage captains and boat owners to have kids on board and put them in the chair when a fish gets hooked,” Sharpe said.
 The tournament will depart from its longtime Beaufort waterfront location and take place at Big Rock Landing along the Morehead City waterfront. The space is larger and will better facilitate weigh-ins, but the big tent on Front Street will be missed by some.
 “We’re excited to host it on the MHC waterfront,” Sharpe said. “We’re glad we can keep kids from Carteret County and outside it interested in sportfishing.”
 The tournament’s major sponsor will be Kurtis Chevrolet of Morehead City.
 “We at Kurtis Chevrolet are proud and excited to be the major sponsor of the newly formed Big Rock Kids Billfish Tournament supporting local children’s charities,” owner Dean Wagaman said.
 The tournament’s primary beneficiary, the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Coastal Plain, provides care to more than 1,300 at-risk and in-need children.
 “They do so many good things for the community,” Sharpe said, “from serving around 1,300 kids every day and instilling principles in them that will stick with them the rest of their life. It’s a great organization we’re proud to support.”
 Sharpe has been with the Big Rock organization for a little more than a year, working in marketing, social media and the online store. The Smithfield native grew up visiting the Crystal Coast often, graduating from UNC Wilmington.
 “I’ve always been passionate about helping kids and getting kids involved in sportfishing,” she said. “I even had a chance to fish The Barta as a kid. I think it’s an opportunity all kids should have.”

Included in the 172,000 potential ballots are about 99,000 absentee ballots that were requested but have not yet been returned. Some of those voters likely decided to vote in person on Election Day and so would not have mailed their ballots back.
 The almost 41,000 provisional ballots cast statewide also must be processed. Counties must research who cast these ballots to determine if they are registered voters and if their choices will count.
 There are also nearly 32,000 absentee ballots that have been accepted by counties, but not yet tallied since a cutoff for inclusion in the Election Night results.
 Election boards in nine counties had scheduled meetings Friday to decide whether to accept 4,300 absentee ballots received by mail and add them to their election night tabulations. Other county boards will meet in the coming days.
 State GOP Chairman Michael Whatley told reporters on Friday that Republicans recognize the formal counting process that state law requires takes time. But he said the release of more data on absentee ballots could bring finality to top races sooner, or allow trailing candidates in extremely close races to prepare to ask for recounts.
 “We do not see anything in the provisional counts or in the absentee counts that gives us any heartburn,” Whatley said. “Our message is that Donald Trump has won North Carolina and that Thom Tillis has won North Carolina.”
 The five-member state board is appointed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Three board members are Democrats.

President Trump led the Republican Party to make great inroads in areas that the Democrats have taken for granted for decades, as he made history and out- performed expectations in Florida, Georgia and Ohio, forcing Democrats to search their souls in wonderment that their much expected trouncing of the president did not materialize, failing to understand better than half of America rejects socialism and the brand of dictatorship they offer. However, this also exhibits just how precariously the cause for freedom and liberty now rests on the hopes and effective efforts of America's conservatives, who should be gravely troubled by the knowledge that such a red, radical Communist as Joe Biden and Company could be within striking distance of the White House and half the nation now embraces a radical agenda that any normal God-fearing American patriot rejects out of hand immediately.

Daniel Kemp, the branch manager at Portsmouth Fox & Sons, part of a national real estate chain, said residential properties are selling for 97% of asking price, which signals a strong market. “We have seen a lot of pent-up demand since the housing market was given the green light to reopen,” he said.
 Kemp attributed that demand to a temporary reduction in stamp duty for certain properties, set to last through March 2021, as well as the extension of a government program, Help to Buy, which aims to make homeownership more accessible. Then there’s the pandemic, which has “people wanting more space to work from home.” One damper on the market, he said, is that lenders have been tightening credit for mortgages.
 Christopher Smeed, a client director of Portsmouth-based NEXA Properties, said he has seen “high demand for all types of property” from locals and buyers coming from London, with apartment hunters especially interested in outdoor space.

The lopsided win over Black (4-3) was in sharp contrast to the teams’ last meeting, where Royal Blue won 3-2. The last two wins for Royal Blue were decided by a single run.
 “We played great,” Lasater said. “Other than the first inning, it was a great night. Everybody hit the ball, the defense played pretty clean and our pitchers did well. It was a well-played game on our part.”
 Black took an early lead in the game with its only run, coming from Ryan Bellamy who reached on a single. His run came at the cost of a Royal Blue error, one of two on the night for the team.
 Bellamy had a tougher time of it on the mound, where he pitched the first two innings and saw six Royal Blue runs go on the board. In the first inning, Matt Lasater hit a single and Bryson Willis doubled to set up runs for both. Willis scored on a sacrifice grounder from Brandon Conway.
 In the second inning, Holden Hamlin and Zach Odum were both walked to put runners on. A single from Lasater scored Hamlin, and a triple from Willis scored both Odum and Lasater. Willis was safe at third for the hit, but an overthrow to home to catch Lasater freed him up for an error-aided trip around the basepaths.
 With his team up 6-1, Royal Blue pitcher Brandon Conway limited the Black offense to three singles and no runs. He pitched four complete innings and struck out five batters before closer Josh Mason took the mound. Mason closed the game out with a solid fifth inning on the mound for Royal Blue, seating three straight batters with fast balls.
 “Brandon is throwing well ever since his first outing,” Lasater said. “He’s going to do his thing. I knew he’d throw three or four innings, then Josh would do the rest.”
 The Royal Blue offense was rolling in the third inning again when Black team coach Jimmy Paylor opted to clear the bases, award Royal Blue the runs and move on to the next inning as the 45-pitch limit neared its capacity.
 Adam McIntosh, Sam Hamlin, Holden Hamlin, Lincoln Strump and Odum all scored runs. Ironically, only Sam Hamlin tallied a hit in the frame, a single. The other four batters were either walked or reached on errors. Black finished with five errors on the night.
 Top hitters for Royal Blue were; Willis who went 2-for-2 with a triple, a double, two RBIs, two runs; Lasater, 2-for-3 with a RBI and a run; and Sam Hamlin, 2-for-2, a run. Gage Bohmuller hit a double.

Election boards in all 100 counties are supposed to complete their full ballot counts by Nov. 13. State GOP leaders demanded that the State Board of Elections provide data as soon as possible from a tracking system linked to absentee ballot envelopes that could determine how many ballots were given to the U.S. Postal Service by Tuesday but have not been received.
 “Disclosure of this data should enable media outlets to call the presidential and U.S. Senate races, among others, almost immediately,” the leaders of the House and Senate elections committees wrote to state elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell.
 State elections board staff provided tracking details to legislators in computer files late Friday but cautioned it wouldn't give them certainty.
 The results from nearly 5.5 million votes cast as of late Friday show President Donald Trump leading Democratic nominee Joe Biden by about 76,500 votes and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis leading Democrat Cal Cunningham by 96,500 votes.
 The post office “generally scans the barcode when they receive the ballot envelope, although this does not happen in every case,” board attorney Katelyn Love wrote. “Thus, it is not possible to determine the complete universe of outstanding ballots from the data.”

On Wednesday (5:56 PM) the Associated Press called Michigan for Biden, as he appeared to have a slim 70,000 vote lead and even though much of the vote was in question. Sometime around three in the morning, while everybody slept, Democrats magically found 138, 339 votes that were all for Biden, without one going to Trump. They later said this occurred due to a technical error and it had been corrected. But, if it happened once and they caught it, how many times did it happen and went unnoticed? One might also question if it was really an "error" and if it was really rectified.
