Shane Warne aptly describes the Rajasthan Royals as the “mavericks”. Over the last 12 years since the inception of the Indian Premier League, the franchise’s USP has been their strategy of taking punts on relatively obscure players more for their skill value than brand value, and using that to shock other teams into winning from nowhere.
 Their rise in the league’s first season from being the butt of jokes at the player auction to being crowned champions, led by the talismanic Warne, is one of cricket’s best underdog stories. They may have failed to bag another trophy, or make the finals since — accounting for the two years lost following the spot-fixing scandal —but it never deterred them from continuing to think out of the box.
 A new three-part documentary on their 2019 season sanctioned by the franchise, _Inside Story: A Season with Rajasthan Royals_ , that released worldwide on the online streaming platform Red Bull TV in early September, gives a good insight into its team dynamics.

De kommer til å fremme et forslag om at kommunedirektøren bes sette i gang med å utarbeide en plan for dyrevelferd som skal gjelde for hele Sortland kommune.


  Årsaken er det mange oppslagene i lokale medier om grove kriminelle handlinger mot dyr.


  – Sortland Høyre mener tiden er inne for å få på plass en dyrevelferdsplan i kommunen. Det er også ønskelig at en plan belyser områder hvor det er naturlig å inngå samarbeid med Dyrebeskyttelsen, skriver partiet i sitt fremlegg.

It's a transatlantic relationship that works both ways.
 It's been frustrating to see much of the attention on the negotiations in the UK centre around agriculture and healthcare, important as they are. But as those conversations go round in circles, we risk losing sight of what is really up for grabs, for smaller businesses, and the services sector.
 Right now, of the small UK firms that export 40% do so to the US, making the US second only to the EU as an important market destination. Small businesses are the backbone of any economy and vital exporters. Abolishing trade barriers and cutting tariffs can help smaller firms and entrepreneurs' access new markets and allow ambition to thrive. Making it simpler for businesses to export, with less paperwork to navigate, would encourage more of those small US and UK businesses, from breweries to booksellers, to look at trading across the pond.
 There's also huge potential to expand services trade, particularly through making it easier for skilled workers to make that leap overseas. Both our countries hold the title of world's largest service exporter, and we are natural leaders in industries like finance and tech.

An attorney charged with killing a Scranton man in a drunken wrong-way collision nearly two years ago will go before a judge next week and potentially learn his trial date.


  Joseph Persico of Shavertown is scheduled for a pretrial conference Sept. 17 before Carbon County Judge Joseph Matika.


  Carbon County District Attorney Michael Greek said the hearing will determine the direction the case will go — whether to a guilty plea or to a trial.


  Persico, 70, had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.22%, more than twice the legal limit, when he crashed just before midnight Nov. 6, 2018, with Paul Gerrity near mile marker 75.4 of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.


  Gerrity, 50, was returning home from his job as a toll collector.


  In January, state police charged Persico with homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence, homicide by vehicle, aggravated assault by vehicle while DUI, aggravated assault, DUI, involuntary manslaughter, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, reckless driving and other traffic citations.


  Persico was arraigned Jan. 13 and waived his right to a preliminary hearing Jan. 29, according to court records.


  His case has been pending since.


  Attempts to reach Persico’s attorney, Paul Walker, were unsuccessful.


  Persico was free on $150,000 unsecured bail.


  Before the crash, Persico was an attorney for Rosenn, Jenkins & Greenwald. He voluntarily left the firm. He also was a solicitor for the Luzerne County Convention Center Authority.

NEW YORK — For the time being, all the polls seem to be going Joe Biden's way ahead of the November 3 presidential election. But gamblers see a different reality and are putting their money on Donald Trump.


  The Republican incumbent, who is seeking a second term, has slowly climbed back since late July to nearly even with the Democratic former vice president.


  For some Australian and British bookmakers, Trump is the odds-on favourite.


  Betting on national or local elections is illegal in the United States. All the action is happening on foreign gambling sites — which Americans can sometimes access.


  A $100 wager on a Trump win today could bring the punter a return of $190 if he notches the victory.


  "There is no doubt that the momentum appears to have swung back into President Trump's favour," said Rupert Adams, a spokesman for British bookmaker William Hill, which has already accepted more than $1.3 million in election bets.


  Lee Price, a spokesman for Irish gambling brand Paddy Power, explains that after a slowdown in betting activity due to the coronavirus crisis, interest has "started to pick up again in recent weeks".


  "We think the Trump factor is sure to keep punters interested," Price told AFP.


  Many who have placed their bets on Trump now are hoping for a repeat of 2016, when the Manhattan real estate mogul staged a stunning comeback against Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton to win the White House.


   

  'Just plain scary'


   

  British bookmaker Betfair has taken in 10 million pounds ($13.3 million) in bets on the White House race since August 23, on the eve of the Republican nominating convention.


  That brings their total so far to 72 million pounds, as compared with 33 million pounds at the same point in the campaign in 2016.


  Betfair is hoping to top the record of 199 million pounds wagered in 2016, half of which came after polling stations closed, explained spokesman Darren Hughes.


  Beyond the main event, Paddy Power is taking bets on some quirky issues: will Trump paint the White House gold (500-1)? Will he have an airport in Mexico named after him (66-1)?


  But Price says the interest in those types of bets has waned a bit.


  "Trump is less wacky, quirky, and funny," Price says, calling the president's current behaviour "just plain scary".


  Matthew Collins, a 29-year-old Australian sales consultant, placed 21 separate bets before the Republican convention — nearly all of them on Trump.


  He picked the president to win again in November, but also as the winner of several specific states. In all, he put down about AUS$20,000 (US$14,570) — a sum he won on a bet that Biden would choose Kamala Harris as his running mate.


  Collins, who describes himself as politically left-leaning, says he thinks Trump has gained momentum since his party's convention in late August, which came on the heels of the Democrats' event.


  "The Republicans seem to like America. They don't hate their own country. I didn't get that from the DNC so I think that their message on its face isn't persuasive," Collins said.


   

  'Watch where


  the money goes'


   

  Nick Freiling, the CEO of a market research firm, who bet $300 on a Trump victory in traditionally Democratic Minnesota, says it's normal for the gap between the candidates to narrow as November approaches.


  The coronavirus crisis is another major factor, he said — Trump faced sharp criticism for his handling of the pandemic, but the issue "is steadily falling out of our public consciousness, and people are less angry about things, generally".


  Collins said he didn't believe the polls were "representative of reality" and said the margin of error "must be so high".


  For Freiling, "the polls may be of 'likely voters' and show Biden winning. But what about voters' enthusiasm for their candidate [which correlates with turnout]? Trump is winning that battle by huge margins".


  "Watch where the money goes," Collins said, predicting that Trump will dominate his three debates with Biden. "That's what people really care about."


  He noted that voters can lie to pollsters about who they are supporting, which could skew results.


  Those with skin in the betting game are also keeping an eye on the likely massive proportion of votes cast by mail this year, due to coronavirus concerns — a potential game changer.


  "That feels like a situation that could get very messy," Collins said.

Again, they say, "The probability of a false negative should not be considered per test, but rather for a given testing regime over a specified period of time." They also consider the real number of tests required to be probably still lower, as there are likely to be more than one positive result in a single pool. Test protocols can also be tweaked to yield the most significant number of true positives by reducing the effect of sample dilution. For instance, the sample volume could be increased to the maximum, or the RNA elution volume reduced, while an order of magnitude increases the Ct positivity threshold. The RNA extraction step may also be omitted until after pooling.

Our identities are not so fragmented in black and white and cemented by just the acts we may commit. We are all works-in-progress with the capacity to heal and be better.

The Leaving Cert class of 2020 is celebrating the best results day ever, with average grade inflation of 4.4pc after teachers assessed their own pupils when the exams were cancelled because of Covid-19. The increase in grade values would have been greater had the teachers&rsquo; generosity not been curbed by the process set up to keep the national results picture broadly comparable with previous years. However, this national standardisation process had only limited impact. More than 60,000 students are receiving results today.At higher level, every single subject clocked up more H1 grades than last year or the year before. H1 represents marks ranging from 90-100pc. Overall, 8.9pc of grades in higher-level subjects were H1s, compared with an average 5.6pc over the past three years. It would have been 13.4pc had many teachers&rsquo; marks not been reduced.The bumper set of grades will drive up CAO points but college applicants from this year&rsquo;s Leaving Cert class have a competitive edge.The big concern is how that will affect CAO applicants from the Leaving Cert class of 2019 and previous years who are competing with them for college offers.Efforts are intensifying to create more college places so as many students as possible get one of their top choices.Last week, Further and Higher Education Minister Simon Harris announced an additional 1,250 places. But there are fears this will not be enough.Education Minister Norma Foley said the final set of results was &ldquo;the fairest possible solution given the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves as we journey together through the Covid-19 pandemic&rdquo;.Sending her congratulations to students, Ms Foley said it was &quot;a very different day from what we had anticipated for you, and from what you had planned and dreamed for yourselves. &quot;I do appreciate what an especially difficult time you have had over the past six months, and I want to commend you for the patience, courage and resilience you have shown in that time.&quot;She said the creation of the calculated grades system - which replaced the summer Leaving Cert exams - came about to ensure there would be a mechanism to enable the class of 2020 to progress to work or further and higher education on completion of their second level school experience.A calculated grade is derived from combination of information provided by the school about a student's expected performance in an exam and national data in relation to the performance of students in exams over a period of time.One measure used was a comparison with the Junior Cert results of the 2020 Leaving Cert candidates.Plans to use data on schools' historical performance in the Leaving Cert was abandoned because of fears it would be unfair to students in schools in disadvantaged communities.The grade inflation seen in the 2020 results was a particular feature at higher level, with teachers more likely to mark up &quot;honours&quot; students. The trend was much more modest at ordinary level.In some higher level subjects, the increases were spectacular. In Accounting, H1s were up from 6.6pc last year to 17.4pc this year, Business H1s were up from 4 pc to 8.5pc and Economics H1s rose from 4..2pc to 10.4pc.But the big jumps were not just in the business areas - they were right across the board in the languages and STEM subjects.Even Religious Education saw a sharp rise from 3.1pc getting H1s last year to 8.8pc of candidates getting the same grade this year.Applied Maths went up from 15.3pc over the past three years to 29.6pc this year.Maths saw H1s increase from 5.8pc over the past three years to 8.4pc this year.The sciences also saw jumps in all subjects. For instance in Biology 8.1pc of all higher level grades were H1s over the past three years but this has risen to 10.8pc this year while Chemistry rose from 12.1pc to 17.1pc and Physics rose from 10.8pc to 15.6pc.Native speakers of foreign languages did exceptionally well - four out of five of the 367 taking Russian secured H1s compared with three out of five last year.Of the 455 taking Polish 36.3pc secured H1s compared with only 8.3pc of the 780 who took it last year.Small numbers took Dutch, only 16 of whom, 56.3pc, were given a H1 compared with 17.6pc of the 17 students last year.However, several hundred native speakers of foreign languages have not been awarded any calculated grades as officials could not get independent and authoritative predictions of how these students would do.Almost 89pc of marks awarded by schools to higher level students stayed the same or fluctuated up or down by no more than five marks; the comparable figure for ordinary level was 95pc. A change in marks does not necessarily mean a grade change.Public health restrictions mean that schools may not be in a position to welcome the previous year's Leaving Cert class today.But the Joint Managerial Body (JMB) representing management in about half of second-level schools, said staff would be available to students in schools to assist them in looking at and considering the options that might be available to them.&quot;We would urge that those students uncertain or unsure as to how to proceed would seek advice and take what time they need in deciding on their next steps,&quot; said JMB general secretary John Curtis.The focus now switches to CAO Round 1 offers on Friday and how that will play out in the face of the bumper 2020 grades. A widespread rise in points can be expected.The Irish Universities Association said while the grade inflation was &quot;understandable given the exceptional circumstances arising from Covid-19 disruption, the Irish universities are aware of the challenges it may pose for applicants who are presenting Leaving Cert results from a previous year.&quot;We understand the position these applicants now find themselves in, and are actively working with Government to endeavour to find a whole of system response to this.&quot;The Technological Higher Education Association (THEA), representing institutes of technology, said the principle of intergenerational equity with previous Leaving Certificate students was particularly important to the institutes, as about 50pc of first year students entered with either a previous year's Leaving Cert result or a Further Education qualification.&quot;We will be working closely with the entire higher education system in order to ensure fairness and equity in the allocation of this year's higher education places across all institutions,&quot; the association stated.

Kaye Banez cried with relief after learning that her eight-year-old son Lazarus, who is on the autism spectrum, can enrol at his school remotely this fall.


  The mother in Richmond, B.C., said school staff told her earlier that Lazarus would need to return to his Grade 6 classes in person by mid-November or face removal from the independent school.


  The risk is too high for Lazarus to go back at this point in the COVID-19 pandemic, said Banez, since he relies on touch to sense the world around him and struggles with physical distancing.


  "We're also trying to keep everybody around him safe," added Banez, noting she has diabetes and her kids' grandparents on both sides of the family have compromised immune systems.


  Banez said it was agonizing as her family worried they would be forced to register Lazarus and his six-year-old sister for home schooling. That would mean Lazarus would lose access to supports, such as speech and occupational therapies, that are paid for through funding that depends on enrolment in school or a distributed learning program — many of which are at capacity, she said.


  After meeting with staff from her kids' school and the Ministry of Education's inclusive education division on Friday, Banez learned about provincial guidelines that stipulate school districts are required to make so- called "homebound" educational services available to students absent from the classroom because of medical and psychiatric reasons.


  The expectation that schools work with families who need access to the homebound program is included in the province's document guiding the response to the pandemic for students in kindergarten to Grade 12.


  However, Banez said she is in touch with another mother on Vancouver Island whose child is on the autism spectrum and who hasn't yet secured a remote learning option through their school.


  "She's done everything that I've done and the answer is still no. So, she's doing now another step of saying she's aware of this operational guideline," said Banez, who serves as the vice president of the board of directors for AutismBC.


  "It's still very inconsistent. Even though the process that parents take to advocate for these accommodations is the same, there's still children being left behind."


  It shouldn't be up to parents to explicitly invoke their rights in order to ensure their kids can access the educational instruction and other supports they need, said Banez.

Așa că, măria sa înstelatul, creatorul de partide, s-a văzut nevoit să umble la conservele din presă.
 Acestea au misiunea de a alipi liberalii de social-democrați, tocmai pentru a recuceri locul de dreapta pentru barnarioți. Misiune aproape imposibilă, mai sunt 2 săptămâni până la locale, ocazie cu care văd un dezastru pentru USR.

Bruges mayor Dirk De fauw first realized something was desperately wrong with European tourism when on a brisk March morning he crossed the Burg square in front of the Gothic city hall and there was nothing but silence."There are always people. Always," De fauw said. That morning?"Nothing. Nobody is on that large square" at the heart of one of Europe's most picturesque cities, he said.Six months later, as Europe's meanest tourist summer season in history is starting to draw to a close, COVID-19 is yet to loosen its suffocating grip on the continent.If anything the pandemic might tighten it over the coming months, with losses piling up in the tens of billions of euros across the 27-nation European Union, and the continent's vaunted government support and social security system under increasing strain to prop up the sector.The upheaval so far, the bloc's executive European Commission said, shows that "revenue losses during the first half of 2020 for hotels, restaurants, tour operators, long distance train operators and airlines were roughly 85-90%." No country has been exempt in an area spanning from Greece's beaches to the trattorias in Rome and the museums of Paris.And even now, the European Commission told The Associated Press, "bookings for September and October remain abnormally low," as dire as 10% of capacity in Bruges. It dents hopes that a brief uptick in business in July would be a harbinger of something more permanent. Over the summer, though, came fresh spikes in COVID-19 contamination, new restrictive measures and regional colour codes that spelled disaster for local tourism when they turn red.It left the European tourism industry relying on hope more than anything else. It was all evident on a late summer's day in Bruges, when usually throngs of American and Asian tourists should have been mixing with Europeans along the cobblestone streets below gabled houses to help boost the annual visit numbers to over 8 million in the city of 110,000."The swans have it all to themselves," muttered Michiel Michielsens as he slowed his boat behind a bank of swans who gracefully obstructed a quick passage on the canals. On a normal day -- not like the one when he had 114 customers instead of 1,200 -- tourists instead of birds would rule the waters. Now a boat could be seen showing a single couple around while normally 40 people fit in one.For tourists who can live with wearing masks for hours, there are some advantages. In Bruges, it extends to the city's famed museums where the medieval Flemish Primitives take center stage. Instead of craning over other tourists flashing smartphones, any visitor could now be alone for minutes on end to study in detail one of Jan Van Eyck's most famous pictures "Our Lady with the Child Jesus, St. George, St. Donaas and canon van der Paele."All this is bittersweet to museum officials though. Across Europe, just about all have had to close for months early this year, and the outlook is bleak.Attendance has now slumped to a quarter of what it was in 2019 at Bruges museums. But during the uptick in July "we had 50%.""So it's declining gradually. Every month we see the numbers declining," said Jonathan Nowakowski, the business director of Bruges Museums. "I can tell you that we're looking at losses of 3.4 to 4 million euros this year," all happening despite expectations being high in a Van Eyck memorial year with special exhibits."We had we thought we would have had huge numbers of visitors," he said.It all quickly trickles down to hotels, restaurants, shops and the survival of families. For those who own the building it is more manageable than for those who rent a building, since often those monthly payments must continue to come. With reservations down for the next months, some hotels will just close down, knowing the costs will never match up to the puny revenue. Others are using the low winter rates in summer.A great many put staff on temporary unemployment, and they acknowledge government aid has been a help. But they fear that will whittle down soon despite the 750-billion-euro recovery fund that EU recently agreed to."In the next few months, we will see a lot of places that will go bankrupt. A lot of people will be unemployed," said Luc Broes, co-owner of the hotel-restaurant Duc de Bourgogne, which overlooks a canal.Social protection, he said, only goes so far."We also have to pay our rent for the building. We also have to pay all the staff. We have to pay the insurances. We have to -- we are not protected. In the moment we can't pay anymore, we will go bankrupt as well," Broes said.Despite the 19th-century novel "Bruges-La-Morte" ("Bruges, the Dead City") that turned the city into a metaphor of melancholy and decay, there is a steadfast conviction that people can turn this around -- that tourism will survive.It is a feeling felt through much of the bloc and a special EU summit is already planned for early October on how to reinvigorate and reform tourism in general.Unsure how long the pandemic will last, Bruges has already decided to forego any blockbuster exhibits. Instead, it will centre on local artists who have been hart hit financially by the pandemic. It includes a photographer tasked to show the solitude that COVID-19 has spawned in the city."They get funds. They get paid, They can survive, and we can offer the visitors something new, something inspiring without having all the logistical difficulties that corona(virus) brings," Nowakowski said.The question of whether there will be more lockdowns, nationwide restrictions or limits on international travel still haunts everyone.Renowned chocolatier Dominique Persoone was lucky to survive on a big local fan base so he could do without the big cruise ship crowds that come and buy his chocolates from his shop, in the shadows of the cathedral."The hardest thing is that you don't know what the future will bring. We don't know how it's gonna be in September, October, when the real chocolate season starts. Then it's Halloween, Santa Claus, Christmas."Now, winter and more uncertainty beckons."We thought we were safe and we had a wonderful life. And, now, this is happening," Persoone said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

BERLIN — Tensions deepened between Germany and Russia over the alleged poisoning of opposition figure Alexei Navalny on Sunday, with Germany threatening sanctions and Russia accusing Berlin of delaying the investigation it demanded.


  Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Navalny fell ill on a flight last month and was treated in a Siberian hospital before being evacuated to Berlin.


  Germany said last week there was “unequivocal evidence” that President Vladimir Putin’s top foe had been poisoned using the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.


  Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, will discuss possible sanctions against Russia if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Sunday.


  “We have high expectations of the Russian government to solve this serious crime,” Maas told German daily Bild. “If the government has nothing to do with the attack, then it is in its own interest to back this up with facts.”


  If Russia does not help clarify what happened “in the coming days”, Germany will be compelled to “discuss a response with our allies”, Maas said.


  Any sanctions decided should be “targeted”, he added.


  Western leaders and many Russians have expressed horror at what Navalny’s allies say is the first known use of chemical weapons against a high-profile opposition leader on Russian soil.


  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell last week called on Moscow to cooperate with an international probe into the poisoning and said the 27-nation bloc would not rule out sanctions.


   

  ‘Very serious questions’


   

  Britain said on Sunday that Russia had “a very serious set of questions to answer” and it was “clear” the Kremlin critic was poisoned with Novichok.


  The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Germany is yet to share any findings with Moscow’s prosecutors.


  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Sunday accused Germany of stalling efforts to probe the case.


  German authorities had failed to respond to a request by Russian prosecutors sent on August 27, she said in a Facebook post.


  “Dear Mr Maas, if the German government is sincere in its statements then it should be interested in preparing a response to a request of the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office as soon as possible,” Zakharova said.


  “So far we are not certain that Germany is not playing a double game”, she added. “Where is the ‘urgency’ you are insisting upon?


  “By not sending its answer, Berlin is stalling the process of investigation for which it’s calling. On purpose?”


  Maas said on Sunday there were “several indications” that Russia was behind the poisoning, in the strongest accusations yet from Germany.


  “The deadly substance with which Navalny was poisoned has in the past been found in the hands of Russian authorities.


  “Only a small number of people have access to Novichok and this poison was used by Russian secret services in the attack against former agent Sergei Skripal,” he said, referring to a 2018 attack on the former double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury.


   

  Nord Stream 2


   

  On the subject of which sanctions could be discussed by the EU, Maas did not rule out action relating to Nord Stream 2, a multibillion-euro Russian-German gas pipeline nearing completion that has drawn the ire of US and European partners alike.


  “I hope... that the Russians do not force us to change our position on Nord Stream,” Maas said, adding that the consequences of any potential cancellation would also need to be weighed while the debate on sanctions should not be “reduced” to one point.


  The controversial pipeline is meant to deliver Russian gas to Europe, but the German government has faced growing calls to abandon it as tensions with Russia escalate.


  Some politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel’s longtime rival Friedrich Merz and foreign affairs committee chair Norbert Roettgen, have called for the pipeline to be stopped.


  Roettgen said the project was simply “encouraging Putin” to “continue his policy”.


  Bild slammed Merkel last week for comments that Nord Stream 2 should be judged independently from Moscow’s actions.


  “Vladimir Putin views the gas pipeline as an important strategic weapon against Europe and as a vital source of funding for his war against his own people,” it said.


  The Navalny case is only the latest in what Berlin has seen as a series of provocations by Putin that have damaged ties and called future cooperation into question.


  The poisoning comes a year after the murder in broad daylight of a former Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park, which German prosecutors believe was ordered by Russia.


  Merkel also revealed in May that Russia had targeted her in hacking attacks, saying she had concrete proof of the “outrageous” spying attempts.

For instance, Costco, a major retailer that collects its customers data on purchase to provide personalized service was able to warn customers who bought stone fruits of possible contamination using the analytics software instead of sending a blanket message to everyone. This increasing need to personalize the service to cater to the customers compels businesses to invest in data analytics tools, thereby increasing demand for the big data and analytics market.

That seems over the top, given that the 2020 Census will come in at around $16 billion. What the money doesn't do is substitute for a well thought-out, widely supported reform plan for an agency that has a declining mail, rising packages, and an occasional but predictable peak, highly secure task. And that's been bleeding money for years on the specious notion that USPS is a private company. The biggest mistake would be to force USPS to build out an expensive, peak capacity infrastructure for one day every four years. Especially since the pandemic won't go on forever.

A fall campaign season where ethics was going to be one of the campaign issues took a new turn last week with the move by House Republicans to form a committee to look into House Speaker Michael Madigan's dealings with Commonwealth Edison.
   
 Madigan called the move a "political stunt" and issued a lengthy, strongly worded statement highly critical of House Republican Leader Jim Durkin.
   
 At the same time a special committee will be investigating Madigan, lawmakers expect to hold hearings on a long-awaited package of ethics reform measures that lawmakers from both parties have been demanding since three legislators in quick succession faced federal charges for a variety of wrongdoing. A fourth lawmaker has since been charged.
   
 House Majority Leader Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, said last week the plan remains to have ethics reform proposals put out for discussion this fall with the idea the General Assembly could vote on them during the veto session. Harris is co-chair of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform.
   
 Harris said he doesn't think the activities of the Special Investigating Committee looking into Madigan will have any effect on the ethics reform proposals. Although the commission hasn't met in months, Harris said it had already accumulated testimony from various interest groups that will be used to help formulate ethics recommendations.
   
 He also doesn't expect any potential partisan rancor over the Madigan investigation to carry over to the commission's work.
   
 "On the ethics commission, the Republican members, the Democrat members, the public members, we've all worked very well together and very collaboratively," he said. "Obviously, there will be potentially some differences on what the end product should be, but I don't think the other activities will impact our working together."
   
 Just how the committee investigating Madigan will work is being developed. A first meeting is planned for Thursday. Committee Chair Rep. Emanuel "Chris" Welch, D-Hillside, said he's not sure how many times the committee may meet or how long the process will take.
   
 "Number one, our guiding post has to be that Speaker Madigan, just like any other member of the House, is entitled to due process and a fair process," he said. "What that looks like we don't know. We have to discuss this as a group."
   
 ComEd agreed to pay a $200 million fine after federal prosecutors charged the utility with one count of bribery. They said ComEd gave contracts and jobs to Madigan associates in an attempt to curry favor with the Speaker. The bribery count will be dropped in the future if ComEd continues to cooperate with prosecutors in their on-going investigation.
   
 Madigan has not been charged with anything and has denied any wrongdoing.
   
 Like Harris, Welch doesn't think the Madigan investigation will get entwined with the work of the ethics commission.
   
 "It is two separate committees. We are going to follow the House rules for this special committee," Welch said. "I believe those are two separate things."
   
 With the committee evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, it is unlikely the votes will materialize to take action against Madigan. Even if the committee were to recommend charges, the issue goes before another panel which decides if it should go to the full House. Finally, it would take a three fifths vote of the House to reprimand or censure Madigan and a two- thirds vote to expel him.
   
 Retired University of Illinois-Springfield political scientist Kent Redfield said he's not even sure what kind of case House Republicans will be able to make against Madigan. The U.S. Attorney's office has said it is continuing to investigate political corruption issues. When news of the investigating committee surfaced, Durkin said the U.S. Attorney's office was notified of it and that it will not interfere with the federal investigation.
   
 Based on that, Redfield said he's not sure where the House committee investigation is headed.
   
 "It's not clear to me what they are going to look at or who they're going to talk to," Redfield said. "The U.S Attorney doesn't want the ComEd people answering questions and going on the records on things that might come up in some kind of trial."
   
 He said it is doubtful that any potential targets of the feds will want to testify to state lawmakers about things federal investigators may be interested in. Moreover, a defense attorney wouldn't allow a client to put himself in jeopardy by testifying, he said.
   
 "I'm not sure what happens with this beyond a flurry of headlines before the election," he said. "If you could get the speaker in there to take the Fifth Amendment before the election that would not be good. But I don't know how they make that happen."
   
 Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield, said there are more than headlines to be had from the House investigation.
   
 "I wouldn't be surprised if there's ethics related legislation that comes out of that," he said. "I certainly think the potential is there to have bi- partisan legislation (from the hearings)."
   
 At the same time, Democrats have to be careful in how they approach the issue, Redfield said. They can slow-walk the proceedings and have people complain about their tactics or they can bring people in and watch them plead the Fifth Amendment.
   
 "It does put the Democrats in a double bind," said Redfield. "They're either going to look like they're obstructing things or the people under suspicion are going to have to refuse to cooperate."
   
 The offshoot of it all may be to motivate Democrats to an even greater degree to get behind meaningful ethics legislation. Redfield said it would be an important step toward rehabilitating the party's image in the wake of four Democratic lawmakers facing federal criminal charges in a little over a year and the cloud now hanging over Madigan.
   
 Whether it gets done during the veto session is unclear given the push by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus to pass comprehensive legislation promoting racial equality and criminal justice reform. But Redfield also said it could be an effective first act for the General Assembly that is seated in January.

I mean, all of us have a gradient, if you will, of bad behaviour that we exist on. And I doesn’t think that it takes less than I think we assume to push us into really, really bad behaviour. So the term I use in my book, Making Evil is the banality of murder, for example.
