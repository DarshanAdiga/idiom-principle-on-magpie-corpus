Meanwhile, computer science progresses at a relatively consistent rate and might one day be capable of replicating all of the many bits and bobs that make a brain work. Presuming that a mind could be coded, down to the cellular or even the molecular or quantum level, maybe you could be duplicated. And if it is indistinguishable from the real thing, then isn't it so?

Providing, of course, that a third season gets the green-light – the original Narcos did run to three seasons, before segueing into the Mexico-set companion series.

As of Wednesday, 17 counties have reported positive cases, according to the DHHR coronavirus dashboard, with the most in Monongalia and Kanawha counties - the state's two largest urban population centers. The majority of Monongalia County's cases come from one nursing home.
 However, while the DHHR dashboard only showed five positives cases for Kanawha County, the Charleston Area Medical Center website showed 17 confirmed cases Wednesday. In Monongalia County, the health department reported 20 cases from the Sundale Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care in Morgantown, but DHHR only showed 18. In Ohio County, two positive cases were reported Tuesday afternoon, but didn't make the DHHR'S total Tuesday evening.
 During a COVID-19 briefing Wednesday afternoon with Gov. Jim Justice and other state officials, DHHR leaders said they were not surprised by the increase in positive coronavirus cases, as those cases coincide with the increase in COVID testing across the state. These include tests conducted at the DHHR Lab in South Charleston, more than 49 hospitals and commercial labs.
 DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch said he hopes to have a more detailed coronavirus dashboard up and running by next week, but starting Friday DHHR will start including more detailed information about positive cases and more frequent updates.
 "We will compile those and try to have them available and updated three time per day," Crouch said. "Clearly, county health departments have the right to publish and announce those positives, so there is a little lag in what comes from the counties and what comes to the state in terms of the Public Health Bureau."
 Dr. Cathy Slemp, state health officer and commissioner of the Bureau of Public Health, said hospitals and commercial labs report positive case numbers to the local county health department, which then gathers information about the positive cases and submits that information to the state. The state then reports that information to the federal government.

Many find themselves in the same place.
 “I’m good friends with a lot of the bartenders and bouncers in town, and a lot of them are definitely struggling because their pay is all based on tips ,” Stahl said.
 Michael Whaley employs about 80 people across three Blacksburg eateries he owns — Top of the Stairs, Bottom of the Stairs and PK’s Bar & Grill. Now TOTS, a popular college hangout, is shut down completely, and he’s training employees on doing deliveries from the other two restaurants. He aims to “keep as much staff as we can” as they transition the businesses.
 “A lot of our staff are career professionals,” Whaley said. “This makes it even harder, because this is how they make a living.”
 Radford is also a college town with many businesses that rely on students to survive. The city’s population increases by nearly 10,000 students when school is in session.
 Kelsi Jones, along with her husband, Todd, bought the city’s longtime watering hole and eatery BT’s Restaurant from former owner Tom Whitehead in early August. The Blacksburg couple both attended Radford University and worked there as students, a demographic that makes up the majority of BT’s staff today.
 “It’s going to be hard and we are trying to give hours to our staff, but we will get through this,” she said. “Even though we are new owners, BT’s has been a staple in Radford for decades and has a loyal customer base that I believe will come back when this is all over.”
 Still, even business owners who have served Blacksburg for years are starting to worry about the effect long-term restrictions and closures will have on the health of their operations.
 Ranae Gillie has owned and operated Gillie’s — a popular vegetarian and pescatarian restaurant located near campus — since 1974, but is considering closing her doors starting Monday if business doesn’t pick up there or at her coffee shop around the corner, Bollo’s Café.
 She said it has been a “ghost town” since spring break and nothing has changed since online classes started Monday.
 Gillie said there might be a market for carryout orders, but that hasn’t panned out as she’d hoped.
 “Honestly we are down about 90% from where we are usually at when school’s in session. … I have funds to get through this but I’m not sure staying open is worth it at the rate we are doing business,” she said Wednesday afternoon.
 Gillie said she is considering taking out a small business loan, and is also hoping the federal relief bill expected to pass this week might offer some relief to business owners like her.
 She said she also hopes the bill will help out her employees who will likely have to file for unemployment even if she remained open on a limited-hour basis.
 “If it sounds like I’m a little discouraged, it’s because I am discouraged,” she said.

Current policy states that owners must process an interim recertification at the tenant’s request if there is a change in income of $50 or more per month. The owner should already have this policy in writing and apply it consistently. To the maximum extent possible, we encourage all owners to work with all tenants with impacted income to adjust rent payments.
