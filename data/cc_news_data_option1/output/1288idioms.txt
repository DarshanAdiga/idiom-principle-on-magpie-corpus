In the U.S., federal, state and local officials negotiated over whether two Holland America cruise ships with sick and dead passengers may dock at Port Everglades, Florida. More than 300 U.S. citizens are on board. Two deaths have been blamed on the virus, and nine people have tested positive, the cruise line said.
 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that the state's health care system is stretched too thin to take on the passengers: “Just to drop people off at the place where we're having the highest number of cases right now just doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
 Trump said later that he would speak with his fellow Republican. “They're dying on the ship,” the president said. “I'm going to do what's right. Not only for us, but for humanity.”
 Over the weekend, the Coast Guard issued new rules directing all cruise ships to remain at sea where they may be sequestered “indefinitely" during the outbreak and be prepared to send any severely ill passengers to the countries where the vessels are registered.

The Indian automotive industry has been going through a rough patch for over a period of time and there are no two ways about it. With back to back challenges such as BS6 implementation, model updates, general market degrowth and now, COVID-19 aka coronavirus and the subsequent nationwide lockdown, things seem pretty gloomy at the moment. Many OEMs have shut down their manufacturing facilities to slow down the spread of COVID-19 and thereby ‘flatten the curve’.

Era cel mai bogat monarh din lume, avea 130 de milioane de supuși, iar imperiul său acoperea a șasea parte din uscat; însă Nicolae al II-lea al Rusiei n-a luat seama la mizeria extremă în care viețuia poporul său. Aflată mereu lângă țar, taciturna împărăteasă Alexandra trăia doar pentru familie și pentru obsesiile ei religioase, alimentate de viziunile unui mistic corupt, Rasputin. Înăuntrul palatelor, luxul nemăsurat al monarhului care conduce prin voie divină învăluie totul; dincolo de porțile lor, masele trăiesc împresurate de ororile Primului Război Mondial și de sărăcia care hrănește gânduri revoluționare. Curând, cele două lumi se vor ciocni, iar din această confruntare se va naște o nouă societate a terorii: Rusia Sovietică. Candace Fleming redă cu un incontestabil talent narativ destinul lui Nicolae al II- lea, ultimul autocrat rus, de la copilăria lui și a viitoarei sale soții până la abdicare și asasinarea întregii familii.

 Worldwide, more than 870,000 people have been infected and over 43,000 have died, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Everywhere, the real figures are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, differences in counting the dead and large numbers of mild cases that have gone unreported.

BP on Wednesday cut its 2020 spending plans by 25% and will reduce output from its U.S. shale oil and gas business in the face of the collapse in oil prices triggered by the coronavirus outbreak.
 BP and other big oil and gas companies are having to rein in spending sharply following the collapse in oil prices driven by a slump in demand because of the coronavirus crisis and a price war between top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia.
 "This may be the most brutal environment for oil and gas businesses in decades," CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement.
 The company said it planned to spend $12 billion this year, joining rivals that have announced cuts of around 20% in annual spending on average. BP had previously said its 2020 spending would be "at the lower end" of a $15 to $17 billion range.
 That will include a $1 billion reduction in investment in its shale business, known as BPX, where production can be switched on and off relatively quickly, representing a 50% drop from 2019 investment levels.
 BP became a leading shale producer following the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's onshore U.S. assets in late 2018.
 BPX output will drop by around 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2020, around 14% lower than its 2019 output of 499,000 boepd. BP's overall oil and gas production is also expected to fall. BP will also reduce capital spending on its refining and marketing, or downstream, business by $1 billion.
 BP shares were down 0.4% by 1040 GMT, compared with a 1.3% decline in broader European energy sector.
 Oil prices dropped by 65% in the first quarter as a result of a big fall in demand following movement restrictions imposed on billions of people around the world to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
 The price war between top oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia added to pressure on prices as the two countries boosted supply to try to win market share.
 BP also plans to introduce $2.5 billion of cost savings by the end of 2021 through the digitalization and integration of its businesses. Looney said BP would not cut jobs in the next three months.
 The company's $15 billion asset disposal program targeted by mid-2021 remains on track, but completion of deals already announced, including the $5.6 billion sale of BP's Alaska assets to Hilcorp, may face delays, it said.
 BP said it has $32 billion of cash and undrawn credit facilities.
 Credit agency Moody's on Wednesday cut BP's outlook from "stable" to "negative" but maintained its A1 rating.
 Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas research at Banco Santander, said that for now BP could maintain its dividend payments, which reached around $8 billion last year.
 "In the next six months, capital and operating expenditure will be redirected towards paying the dividend," Kenney said.
 For the first quarter of the year, BP expects to take an impairment charge of $1 billion, while oil and gas output is expected to decline from the previous quarter by a range of 2.55-2.6 million boepd.
 In response to the coronavirus outbreak, BP is reducing non-essential activity and manning levels at projects.

With coronavirus self-quarantining relegating many of us to our couches until further notice, the usual free-time question "What do you want to do?" has fast become "What do you want to watch?"
 There are the cable news channels, of course, but even the news junkies among us can tire of talking heads.
 And it's OK to admit that you've already re-watched the third season of "The Crown," and maybe the first two seasons, too, for good measure, and that you've binge-watched "Mad Men" again, and are full up on "Grace and Frankie," never mind "Will & Grace."
 With television likely to be a primary source of entertainment for the foreseeable future, however, it's time to expand our viewing habits. For theater fans, the streaming service BroadwayHD may be just the ticket.
 The platform offers a library of nearly 300 productions, with acquired performances of "Cathy Rigby in Peter Pan," "Elaine Stritch at Liberty," "The King and I," "The Sound of Music," and "Cats," along with originals filmed by BroadwayHD including Broadway performances of "Kinky Boots" and "42nd Street," as well as plays and musicals from London's West End and other theaters around the world.
 In a nod to today's home-viewing habits, the streaming service currently has two playlists available that are custom-made for people looking to binge-watch Broadway.
 In honor of Women's History Month, a special playlist focuses on female theater artists, with performances of "A Night with Janis Joplin," "Driving Miss Daisy," "Ann," "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill," and more.
 The second special playlist celebrates this month's birthdays of two Broadway legends, Stephen Sondheim, 90, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, 72, with performances of some of their most iconic shows. For Sondheim, these include "Gypsy," "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," and "Putting it Together."
 Sir Andrew will be celebrated with "Cats," "The Phantom of the Opera," and "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."
 BroadwayHD is currently offering a free seven-day trial subscription. For information about that and more, visit broadwayhd.com.
