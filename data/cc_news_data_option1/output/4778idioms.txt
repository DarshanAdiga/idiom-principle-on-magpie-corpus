ITV Racing's Kevin Blake looks back on Saturday's Betfair Chase, analysing the performances of the three main contenders and what might lie ahead... When looking back on what was another memorable renewal of the Betfair Chase, the starting point has to be the ground. Soft ground was expected, but heavy rain on the day of the race resulted in it becoming very testing indeed. The times on the card reflected this, with the winning time of 7m 3.63s of the Betfair Chase being the slowest winning time in the history of the race. While we don't have a ground description that goes beyond heavy, this was a notably testing version of heavy ground. One horse that has long been established as being ruthlessly effective on such a surface is Bristol De Mai. The nine-year-old had won the 2017 renewal of the Betfair Chase by a remarkable 57 lengths in similarly testing conditions and his connections would have been dancing in the rain in the build-up to the race on Saturday. Having made much of the running, Bristol De Mai produced a wonderfully brave and relentless display of galloping and jumping on his way to seeing off Clan Des Obeaux by two lengths. We didn't learn anything new about Bristol De Mai as such, but his performance hammered home that he is still a power at the highest level, particularly when the ground is testing. While it is tempting to pigeonhole him as a Haydock specialist, he has produced high-class efforts at other tracks and will warrant respect wherever he goes when the mud is flying. Grean run by Clan but will it leave its mark ahead of the King George? Paul Nicholls had been notably bullish about how forward Clan Des Obeaux was coming into the race and he acquitted himself very well indeed in getting so close to Bristol De Mai. While Clan Des Obeaux's very best form has come on a less testing surface than this, it shouldn't be forgotten that he produced what was at the time a career-best effort when winning a graduation chase on the same card that Bristol De Mai sploshed through the mud to win the Betfair Chase by 57 lengths. He travelled through the race very strongly indeed and certainly looked the winner early in the home straight (traded as short as [1.22] in-running), but was out-gunned by Bristol De Mai close home. It was a run that was right up there with his best efforts and was widely considered a great lead-in race for his bid for a historic third King George VI Chase next month. Though, one has to wonder whether this was more of a gruelling test than ideal at the start of his campaign. Nicholls will no doubt be focusing on freshening him up again in time for Kempton, but how well he can bounce back from this slog will be a question that follows him to Kempton. Disappointing start to campaign for Tizzard's star The disappointment of the race was Lostintranslation. He didn't travel with his usual verve and his jumping wasn't as fluent and efficient as we are accustomed to seeing from him, particularly in the second half of the race. My inclination is to blame the ground. He had only run on ground that Timeform described as heavy once before, in a Grade 2 novice hurdle at Haydock back in January 2018, and he had run poorly there too. There may well have been something else at play, but that he failed to travel with his usual strength represents a flashing red light that we didn't see the best of Colin Tizzard's Lostintranslation on the day. It is somewhat encouraging with a view to his prospects of quickly leaving this run behind him that Lostintranslation bounced back from an abysmal run in the King George VI to run so well in the Gold Cup at the Cheltenham Festival last year. However, it could hardly be considered anything but a disappointing start to his campaign.

Among the significant takeaways from Nadda's first executive endeavour was a focus on the east and the south to rectify a perception that the BJP was a party belonging to the north and west and jump-start the procedure to nurture a new leadership line-up and avoid the "stagnancy" that settled in between 2004 and 2014, when the party was out of power at the Centre. "For the first time in the BJP's history, we have two vice-presidents, two general secretaries, and three morcha chiefs from the south. There is a recognition that we reached a saturation point in the north and west, and in Karnataka, the only southern state we have. We are zero in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and have some way to go in Telangana and Kerala," a central office-bearer said.

Australia is having a run deadly enough to make one think twice about going to the beach, with a 55-year-old man becoming the eighth shark fatality of the year in an attack Sunday at Cable Beach, on the Indian Ocean coast. The man was attacked by an unknown species of shark, suffered wounds to his thighs and hand, and died at the scene. The beach has since been closed and is under patrol. The attack makes 2020 the deadliest year in almost a century, when nine people were killed by sharks in 1929, notes Sky News. CNN notes that by comparison, 2019 saw zero fatal attacks. (One shark attacked a woman, and her husband was not having it.)

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden's first Cabinet picks are coming Tuesday and planning is underway for a pandemic-modified inauguration in January as his team moves forward despite road blocks from the Trump administration. Ron Klain, Biden’s incoming chief of staff, offered no details Sundays about which department heads Biden would first announce. The Associated Press has reported that Biden could name his nominee for secretary of state or treasury secretary this coming week. Biden has pledged to build the most diverse government in modern history, and he and his team often speak about their desire for his administration to reflect America. That has some Washington observers waiting to see whether he will make history by nominating the first woman to lead the Pentagon, the Treasury Department or the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the first African American at the Defense Department, the VA or the Treasury Department. Biden said last week he had settled on his pick for treasury secretary. Klain said the Trump administration's refusal to clear the way for Biden's team to have access to key information about agencies and federal dollars for the transition is taking its toll on planning, including the Cabinet selection process. Trump's General Services Administration has yet to acknowledge that Biden won the election — a determination that would remove those roadblocks. “We’re not in a position to get background checks on Cabinet nominees. And so there are definite impacts. Those impacts escalate every day,” Klain told ABC's “This Week.” Even some Republicans have broken with Trump in recent days and called on him to accept the results of the election. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said there was a “very good chance” Biden...

Both Chelsea and Tottenham went top of the Premier League table at different stages on Saturday, and they are now firmly in the hunt to win the title. Mike Norman has the details... Tottenham ended the day on top of the Premier League table thanks to a tactically-disciplined performance in beating Manchester City 2-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday evening. Spurs got off to the perfect start when inside five minutes Son Heung-min broke City's high line and ran through on goal, collecting Tanguy Ndombele's pass before slotting the ball between Ederson's legs. From that moment on it was pretty much a Jose Mourinho masterclass as he instructed his side to sit deep, block out Man City's usually incisive attacks, and restrict Pep Guardiola's men to crosses from wide. City occasionally looked dangerous when they managed to pass the ball through Tottenham's block, and they did have the ball in the net midway through the first half, though Aymeric Laporte's goal was correctly ruled out when it was adjudged that Gabriel Jesus had handled the ball in the build up. The second half was much more end-to- end, and although City enjoyed more possession it was Tottenham who looked the more dangerous when winning the ball and hitting the Citizens on the counter- attack, as demonstrated when scoring their second goal. Spurs won possession in their own penalty area and played the ball to Harry Kane - who was outstanding on the day - in the middle of the park. The England striker turned and ran at the City defence, before playing a perfectly-weighted pass to Giovani lo Celso who fired the ball home just seconds after coming on as a substitute. The 2-0 Correct Score was matched at a high of [46.0] In-Play, while the victory for Tottenham took them back to the top of the table, a position they held for just a few hours before the international break. Stroll in the St James' Park for Blues It was Chelsea who had gone top of the table themselves earlier in the day thanks to a 2-0 win over Newcastle at St James' Park. In a totally dominant display - Frank Lampard's men enjoying 92% possession in one 10-minute spell during the first half - the Blues went ahead inside 10 minutes when Federico Fernandez turned the ball into his own net at the back post following Mason Mount's low cross. Timo Werner wasted a few golden opportunities to double Chelsea's lead but the striker was the architect behind Tammy Abraham's goal when he produced a dazzling run and pass midway through the second half to assist his teammate. Before Sunday's late game between Liverpool and Leicester, Chelsea were trading at around [6.4] in the Premier League Winner market, just behind Tottenham who have been cut to [6.0]. Liverpool are the slight favourites at [3.4], just ahead of Man City at [3.6]. More misery for bottom sides It's been another poor weekend for the relegation-threatened sides with West Brom, Fulham and Sheffield United all losing by single-goal margins. Following Brighton's win at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon a five-point gap opened up between the Seagulls in 16th, and the four teams below them in the table. That gap was maintained when the Baggies were unfortunate to lose 1-0 at Manchester United in a game dominated by two controversial VAR penalty decisions, while the Cottagers missed a second-half penalty when losing 3-2 at home to Everton on Sunday afternoon; Dominic Calvert-Lewin adding another two goals to his already impressive tally this season for the Toffees. Following West Brom's defeat the Blades lost 1-0 at home to West Ham meaning Chris Wilder's men sit rock bottom of the table having collected just one point from a possible 27 this season. In the Relegation market Fulham can be backed at [1.34] to go down, while West Brom are also strongly fancied for the drop, trading at [1.4] with Sheff United also odds-on at [1.84]. Man United's much-needed win took them up to 10th in the table, three points behind Everton in sixth and one behind the Hammers in eighth. The Red Devils are available to back at [1.54] in the Top 6 Finish market, with the Toffees trading at around the [3.0] mark and West Ham at [12.0].
