"These people were busy cheating my brother Edgar that Bill 10 would go through without fail yet in the background they were encouraging the UPND MPs to get the money but stay away from voting. I know my brother Edgar released a lot of money for this project. Some of the people who were given the assignment to entice the UPND MPs ended pocketing the money. The worst culprits are those who were given money to give independent MPs. We are in government and surely we failed to convince independent MPs who are not answerable to the UPND. That should be very embarrassing and the cartel are well known because they know they won't be adopted in 2021. So their only survival is to remove Edgar Lungu as PF Presidential candidate. They want the Presidency to go back to the North or Luapula," Siliya lamented.

Friedman argued that the Trump administration has put pressure on Iran and the Palestinians that "the only strategy they really have right now is to hope Trump loses."
 Under a [Democratic nominee Joe] Biden administration, "the maximum pressure on Iran would be in jeopardy and make it more likely that Iran would have the funds necessary to ramp up their malign activity.
 "Conversely, with maximum pressure, there is a likelihood [Iran's leaders] would moderate their behavior, because they're going broke," the ambassador said.
 Friedman dismissed concerns that Trump may be eager to sign a new deal with Iran - which he has mentioned many times in recent months - that he would be willing to compromise on security.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo "set out 12 points and that will be the template if there is ever a deal. That includes no aid to terrorism, no ballistic missiles, no nukes, no adventurism throughout the region - the basics. I don't see any deal by the Trump administration that wouldn't have that."
 Overall, Friedman assessed the past four years as being relatively peaceful for Israel.
 "The reason for that is we have had an unambiguous level of support for Israel. We never threw around stupid words like 'proportionate force,'" Friedman said. "Israel's enemies knew we expect Israel to defend itself just like the US would from an attack."
 Friedman recounted a "disturbing" experience meeting Sen. Bernie Sanders, who came in second place in the Democratic presidential primary. Before Friedman's confirmation, he had courtesy calls with about 70 senators.
 The ambassador recounted that Sanders asked him to "concede that Israel uses disproportionate force in Gaza."
 "I said to him, 'let's say a hospital is also a depot for rockets, so that the source of the rockets is in a building that has a red crescent on it and maybe there are a couple of people there who are really sick. What do you do then? Are you saying... if a terrorist organization is shooting indiscriminate rockets at civilian populations from schools and hospitals, the recipient of those attacks can't attack the source of the missiles?'
 "And [Sanders] says, 'I think we're done. It's very complicated,'" Friedman recalled. "I said, 'if it's so complicated, why are you so free with your accusations?' I saw a guy who almost became president with a reflexive view that Israel has almost no right to defend itself."
  Friedman said he does not think that view is prevalent in the US government, and "not every Democrat sees it that way," but that this "frightening" school of thought exists.
  Asked if the thinks that school of thought influences Biden or policies, Friedman said he does not know.
 "I assume he's getting a lot of polling as to what's popular among his potential voters, and he's surrounded by people who are scary. Sanders, [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren, [Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [Rep.] Ilhan Omar frighten me," he said.
 The ambassador expressed concern that Israel's enemies will see subtle political movements in the US as a window of opportunity to attack Israel.
 "One thing I've learned on this job is that people in the region watch the signals incredibly carefully... to the extent that Israel's enemies see a signal suggesting they can get away with malign activity they are much more likely to take a chance," he said.
 Friedman also responded to a number of claims and arguments put forward by Biden's advisers and surrogates. For example, he pointed to Biden surrogates treating the Abraham Accords like "low-hanging fruit," something that had long been in the works and easy to achieve.
 "Then why didn't you pick the fruit when you had a chance?" Friedman asked.
 He also responded to the position that the accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were "just an arms deal," and that selling F-35 fighter jets to the UAE endangers Israel.
 Friedman said he did not hear the warplanes come up at all during the talks preceding the announced UAE-Israel normalization, though, in light of Egypt and Jordan receiving F-16s after making peace with Israel, he said there was surely "a recognition that as countries become aligned with Israel they can make a better case" for buying US arms.
 As for retaining Israel's qualitative military edge (QME), Friedman pointed out that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz worked hard on the matter in recent weeks, with Gantz meeting US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper three times in the past month, and reached an agreement that there is a way for the US to complete the sale without putting Israel's QME in jeopardy.
 "I think the whole thing was politicized.
 I don't think there was anything to this. I listened to the QME analysis being done... in the Pentagon. The one thing that struck me was how committed everyone in the US is to Israel's QME. They're all extremely driven by the idea that it's just non-negotiable," he said.
 Friedman also said he saw no merit in the claims that Trump has empowered antisemites on the Right.
 "What you're seeing is the politicization of antisemitism," he said. "It's hard to watch... There are antisemites on the Right and antisemites on the Left. It's not unique to either political branch. There are terrible, horrible people on both extremes, and there always have been."
 He referred specifically to Trump saying "you also had people that were very fine people on both sides" at a 2017 protest against tearing down a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, at which people shouted "Jews will not replace us."
  "I can't believe I'm hearing this thing about Charlottesville four years later," Friedman said. "He was clearly distinguishing between people who showed up to a rally and people who are in the [Ku Klux] Klan or other hate groups."
 "Jewish people will suffer from this, because as long as it's politicized, antisemitism will continue and people will suffer. It's a completely self- inflicted wound by the Jewish community," he added.
 Pushed on Trump's perceived reticence to condemn right-wing hate groups, Friedman said the president has repeatedly condemned those groups, but also makes sure to bring up extremism on the Left at the same time.
 "I think there's no 'there' there," he said. "I know him for 20 years, under all kinds of circumstances... and have never heard anything that would suggest he has an affinity for hate groups on either side. That's just not who he is. I think he perceives every question asked of him as an attempt at a 'gotcha' because of bias in the media, and he wants to make sure antisemitism is called out across the spectrum.
 "If I thought he was being ambiguous about it, I would call him and say so," Friedman added.

WARREN, Mich. (AP) — Some experts say police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic, and other issues around race have increased anxiety levels among African Americans. Suburban Detroit resident Eddie Hall says he was already on edge when racist graffiti was scrawled on his pickup and shots were fired into his home after his family placed a Black Lives Matter sign in their front window in September. A 24-year-old white neighbor eventually was arrested and charged with ethnic intimidation and other crimes. University of Michigan sociology professor Alford Young Jr. says the anxiety seems more pronounced among Black professionals, who feel frustrated that these kinds of issues are still surfacing.

 I won’t bore you with the latest Netflix series I’m into. Besides, it seems like I lose interest mid-season, no matter what the show is. Maybe it’s the post-Game of Thrones phenomenon where nothing is quite good enough to keep my attention until the end. And we know how that ended.

On the Performing Arts Center’s stages, he has performed in a variety of productions. Gibson played Matt and the evil Mr. Burns in the black comedy “Mr. Burns: A Post Electric Play.” In “One Flea Spare,” a production set during the Great Plague of London, which reached its peak in 1665, the actor portrayed vulgar guard Kabe, who is responsible for keeping people quarantined in a boarded-up house. In the comic-drama “She Kills Monsters,” the fantasy- adventure game Dungeons & Dragons came to life onstage, and Gibson portrayed Orcus, “the overlord of the underworld.” In November, he will have a role in “Corner Lot,” a University Playhouse production.
 Texas A&M-Commerce University Assistant Professor of Theater Rebecca Worley, who will direct “Corner Lot,” praised Gibson.
 “I’ve had the pleasure of working with Aaron in a number of capacities, both in and out of the classroom,” Worley said. “He is always ready to take on whatever role — acting, designing or stage managing — he can to further his understanding of the craft.”
 Gibson has also had roles in Greenville productions, including “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” and “Nanyehi” at the Texan Theater. For the Greenville Theater Works at the Greenville Municipal Auditorium, he played several roles in “It’s a Wonderful Life, A Live Radio Play.”
 Michael Knight, theater department head and professor of theater design and technology at Texas A&M-Commerce University, remarked on Gibson’s success as a theater student.
 “Graduate student Aaron studies and engages in a variety of aspects of the theater arts, including acting and design,” Knight said. “His enthusiasm both on and off stage is a testament to his creativity as a theater artist.”
 During his years at the university, Gibson has honed his technical skills, particularly as a lighting designer.
 “I leaned toward going into technical theater until COVID happened,” he said. “Now I am looking into going into teaching after I receive my masters in theater.”
 “Aaron is kind, talented, dedicated and always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone who needs it,” Dr. Carrie Klypchak, Texas A&M-Commerce University Director of Theater Graduate Studies, said. “He is a true asset to our department, and I know that he will continue to achieve great things upon his graduation.”

An actor who has found a way to ply his craft on and offstage, the imposing 6-4 Aaron Gibson remains the consummate performer. He specializes in shady villainous haunters, such as Ricketts, a spooky, darkly comic and extremely large ventriloquist’s puppet during his regular gig at Reindeer Manor Halloween Park.
 “Since 2014, I have been working at Reindeer Manor,” Gibson said during a recent interview. “I’m one of the roving actors who entertains the crowds before they go inside. I named myself. I did some research and learned about rickets disease, which weakens children’s bones. Since puppets don’t have fluid movement, I decided that Ricketts would be a good name for my character.
 “The Reindeer Manor Halloween Park in Red Oak, Texas, is the oldest haunted house show in the nation. This is the 47th straight season for it. The history of the place includes some actual horrors. The Sharp family used to own the whole thing. For the purposes of the Halloween Park, the backstory of the place has been exaggerated. I guess you could say it has been Hollywooded up.”

WARREN, Mich. (AP) — The events of 2020 already had Eddie Hall on edge.
 Then, the troubles of a nation in turmoil landed on Hall's doorstep in suburban Detroit in September when racist graffiti was scrawled on his pickup truck and shots were fired into his home after his family placed a Black Lives Matter sign in their front window.
 “I’m in combat mode. I’m protecting my family,” Hall, a 52-year-old Black man from Warren, told The Associated Press.
 Some experts say police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic that has taken disproportionate physical and financial tolls on Black people, and other issues around race have increased anxiety levels among African Americans, like Hall.
 The attacks on Hall's home were investigated as a hate crime and 24-year-old white neighbor, Michael Frederick Jr., eventually was arrested and charged with ethnic intimidation and other crimes.
 “We, as Black people, have all of the normal human stressors — work, family, finances — and then we’re inundated with racial pressure at all levels,” said Jessica Graham-Lopresti, assistant professor of psychology at Suffolk University and co-founder of Massachusetts-based BARE — Black Advocacy Resilience Empowerment.

A fistfight nearly broke out on the House floor at the end of the 2017 session that was marked by tense battles over immigration, and that same year, lawmakers were pulled into a summer special session over a "bathroom bill" that targeted transgender people.

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) — Injured West Virginia kicker Evan Staley said he will miss the rest of the season. Staley said Sunday on Twitter that he will have surgery soon. He didn't specify what the injury was or when it occurred. Staley made six of nine field-goal attempts and all 19 extra point tries this season. He missed a 51-yard field goal on West Virginia’s first offensive series of Saturday’s 37-10 win over Kansas State, then made a 19 yarder later in the first quarter and was on the field for the ensuing kickoff. Casey Legg later made field goals of 25 and 45 yards. Staley said he is ready to start the recovery process and looks forward to returning to the field. “Wishing my teammates and coaches the best of luck for the rest of the season and I will be their biggest fan until I am able to join them again!” Staley said. West Virginia (4-2, 3-2 Big 12) plays at Texas (4-2, 3-2) next Saturday.

That's not the same as having President Trump, who wasn't on the ballot in 2018, said Jeremy Johnson, a political analyst at Carroll College in Helena.
 “Everybody put together does not equal Trump,” Johnson said. “Trump’s the big draw. He’s the one who the press follows … He is prioritizing his election to the presidency over everybody else.”
 Bullock, a two-term governor and former Montana attorney general, has avoided direct confrontations with Trump. He entered the Senate race in March under pressure from fellow Democrats and after dropping a long-shot bid for the party's presidential nomination. After veering to the political left during that bid, he's focused his Senate campaign on health care and public land protections and says he would be a uniting figure in Washington.
 Bullock hasn't brought in many well-known Democrats to campaign with him and claims independence from party leaders.
 Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016 and Daines has emerged as a close ally. The first-term lawmaker and former corporate executive backed the president’s tax cuts and immigration policies, defended Trump during his impeachment trial and switched from booster on U.S.-China relations to ardent China critic after Trump blamed Beijing for the pandemic.
 There are signs Trump’s support in Montana has slipped in the past four years including Tester’s 2018 reelection, which came after Trump held four large rallies on behalf of the Republican challenger, state auditor Matt Rosendale. It was a record number of visits to Montana by a sitting president.
