New Delhi [India], July 29 (ANI): A public interest litigation (PIL) seeking actions against the illegal slaughtering of big animals in the national capital committed by certain persons on the occasion of Eid ul-Adha every year was on Wednesday withdrawn from the Delhi High Court.   A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan allowed the petitioner to withdraw the PIL with the liberty to approach authorities concerned and asked them to decide on the representation according to the law, rules and government policies.   The PIL, filed by law student Sana Khan, had stated that certain persons are putting up banners offering the facility of Qurbani (slaughtering big animals) on the occasion of Eid ul-Adha.   The plea, moved through advocate Rajeev Sharma, said that in Delhi Municipal Corporations are responsible to issue licenses after making required scrutiny and verifying the locality for which license is sought for.   Eid ul-Adha, a festival of sacrifice in Islam, will be celebrated on August 1 this year. The festival is marked by sacrificing an animal that is close to them to prove their devotion and love for Allah and subsequently, offerings are distributed to family, friends, and the needy.   "Under such a license, the license holder is permitted to sell meat to the consumers. None of the individuals is permitted to slaughter the animal under the MCD Act," the plea said.   The petitioner claimed that illegal slaughtering by the private persons is taking place at the places which have not been demarcated for slaughtering.   "By this act of slaughtering, these persons disturb the peace of area on account of the sound raised by the animal during the process of slaughtering. These persons are involved in the slaughtering of big animals at a very large scale and apart from the local pollution as mentioned above, they throw the bigger part of the waste at the bank of Yamuna River," the plea said.   "No slaughtering is permissible without holding the valid license as issued by the Corporation.   Wrong acts are committed by certain persons which amount to a threat to the health of the common man," the plea said seeking directions to Delhi Police to take appropriate action against the wrongdoers.   The petitioner claimed that she had already submitted a complaint along with necessary documents and proof of pollution at the bank of Yamuna River.   "Every year on the occasion of Eid ul-Adha, the same act is being repeated, therefore, respondents are largely responsible for the problems faced by the common man on account of illegal slaughtering," the plea added.

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) [India], July 29 (ANI): An advertisement by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board for recruitment in the jail department created a controversy on Wednesday when it indirectly referred to Sikkim as an independent State and not a part of India.   In the eligibility criteria for the position of guard in the jail department in Madhya Pradesh, Vyapam's advertisement said that the candidate should either be a citizen of India or "People of Sikkim (Sikkim ki praja)."   The others eligible included people of Indian origin who have permanently migrated from Pakistan to India, people of Nepal, or people of French and Portuguese colonies situated in India.   Earlier, the Delhi government committed a similar blunder in March this year when in an advertisement for a volunteer position in Civil Defence Corporation, they referred to people from Sikkim as "subject" of the state alongside Nepal and Bhutan.

Mail-in ballots are a very good way to conduct voting during the pandemic and possibly as a long-term procedure. It allows voters to cast a ballot without attending a voting place.
 However, there is one potential problem that should be addressed. I have been a teller and a warden many times over decades and have found that about one out of a thousand ballots contain an error that inhibits the machine from counting all candidates or items on the ballot.
 At the precinct, we are able to return the ballot to the voter, have the original ballot set aside, and provide a replacement ballot to the voter. Mail-ins don't have a ready solution to this problem.
 The long-time solution could be to have the machines reprogrammed to ignore the errored vote area and accept the rest of the ballot. But this solution would take time to write and incorporate new algorithms to the system and the current situation does not provide the time necessary to carry this out.
 A second solution is to allow the warden or town clerk to recreate a ballot omitting the errored area including all valid votes, and putting aside the failed ballot.
 A third solution would be to tally the ballots at the Town Hall as they are received, and to notify the voter of the error. Somehow, we must find a solution to insure all voters selections are carried out if possible to preserve our democratic election system.

Valencia [Spain], July 29 (ANI): Valencia's newly appointed manager Javi Gracia has said that his objective for the next season is to try to win every game.   "There is no greater ambition than to win every game, and that is what we are going to try to do," the club's official website quoted Gracia as saying.   "Saying that we are going to finish in a certain position doesn't get you anywhere; I prefer to be ambitious on an everyday basis, and create the necessary conditions to have more of a chance of winning more games. That is the objective. I would say that we are ambitious in our objectives, but moderate in our expectations," he added.   The club on Monday announced that Gracia has agreed to a two-year contract which will keep him at the club until June 2022.   Valencia finished ninth in the 2019-2020 La Liga season. Gracia said that he wants the club to have a balance in attack and defence.   "I would like the team to be intense, aggressive in the opposition half - with and without the ball - and for us to dominate games even when we don't have possession. I want balance in attack and defence that is shown in the numbers," he said. (ANI)

With his obvious history of conflict regarding our club, he seems intent on belittling everything we do and never seems to question dubious refereeing decisions.
 Phil Neville – Defender / Midfield – Clubs Man Utd (10 years) Everton (8 years) – winning 11 trophies. A full England International from 1996-2007, winning 59 caps. Not as impressive as his older brother, but a success, nonetheless.
 Again though, when we look at his managerial career, the same questions arise. His only senior managerial record is listed as Manager of the England Women’s team from 17th January 2018 to July 2021. He oversaw 35 games, of which 19 were wins, 5 drawn and 11 lost.
 He was also assistant manager to his brother at Valencia and followed his brother out of the club, following the miserable results detailed above.
 So, I ask, once again, what makes Phil Neville an expert in the management side of punditry? What evidence is there that he should be able to sit in his chair, telling anyone who wants to listen what managers/coaches are doing wrong?
 I also listen on in amazement, when either of the Nevilles condemn players who are caught out on TV using bad tackles that might end a players career.
 I am sure every Gooner will remember these two brothers doing a hatchet job on Jose Antonio Reyes, supported in no small way by the referee, as they ended our Invincible run?
 There is no doubt in my mind, that they were sent out to injure Jose as a minimum result of their assault on our player. When questioned about it, Gary maintains that it was all part of the rough and tumble that happened when the two clubs met, while Phil was reported as saying: “They [Arsenal] had a young Spanish winger called Juan(sic) Antonio Reyes, and we literally kicked him off the park. Every time he got the ball, Gary smashed him. Next time he got the ball, I smashed him. I remember looking at him and thinking, ‘What am I doing in English football?'”
 We should also remember that Phil was warned over his remarks on a MOTD show, when he said that he would take a player out of the game if he had seen them perform a pass without looking – these comment were made after he had watched Tomas Rosicky pull off this feat, in a 3-2 FA cup win against BHA.
 The full quote? “If that was a training session and somebody did that, I’d probably look to two-foot him or take him out of the game. If somebody did that in training to me, winding me up, I would be straight in there, I’d smash them.”…it seems to me that is exactly what you and your brother tried to do to Jose and it’s no coincidence he went back to Spain, following this planned attack on a fellow professional.

Due to the designs being identical, the wireless version will no doubt come with all the issues that the wired version comes with.So what does the Pro X wireless sport?

OUR POSITION: A belated report on the algae bloom scourge of 2018 and its impact when mixed with red tide is disturbing to say the least.
 It’s just common sense, we suppose, that if you mix two ingredients that have proven to cause health problems, the chances of getting sick or suffering adverse effects are more likely.
 Brain Chemisty Labs, a non-profit research institute in Jackson, Wyoming, released a report earlier this year that outlines just how bad things really were in 2018 when blue-green algae blooms from Lake Okeechobee were released into the Caloosahatchee River. When those blooms reached the Gulf of Mexico and met that year’s outbreak of red tide, the toxins formed were dangerous.
 If we had known all the facts outlined in the Brain Chemistry report then, the call for action by health officials and Florida’s government would have been even louder. Those small groups that hassled Gov. Rick Scott may have grown larger and louder — maybe even to the point of serious political implications for Scott, now serving as one of Florida’s senators.
 Here is what we have learned from the Brain Chemistry report (which we’ll state as simply as we can put it).
 Blue-green algae produces a toxin labeled BMAA, which has been found to cause Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS) in monkeys. A published study also shows that BMAA can cause brain changes that resemble Alzheimer’s.
 Dr. Larry Brand, a University of Miami professor of Marine Biology, says the same toxins have been found in the brains of dolphins with Alzheimer’s neuropathology.
 When the algae was released in 2018 and washed down the Caloosahatchee, it came at the same time red tide was holding our beaches hostage along the state’s west coast. When the two collided, the outcome was, simply put, toxic.
 The study shows that water samples found concentrations of blue-green algae high enough to cause human and animal health effects if ingested. In other words, dolphins, fish and other sea creatures could get sick and die — thus the large amount of fish washing ashore onto our beaches that summer. And, any humans not careful enough to avoid swimming in the stuff and who might possibly ingest some water from the Gulf or river, could possibly end up with some pretty bad symptoms — that’s the common sense concern we have.
 The study says that Florida health officials should have strongly warned the public in 2018 of the dangers related to the toxins in the water released from Lake Okeechobee. It says the water was a risk factor for ALS, Alzheimer’s and liver cancer, said Howard Simon, president of Clean Okeechobee Waters Foundation, Inc.
 This information raises our concerns even more. Multiple studies are planned to take this information and expound upon it. There are fears the algae blooms can sicken or possibly even kill livestock. And, of course, it can’t be too healthy for humans either.
 Investigators at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation and the Calusa Waterkeeper in Fort Myers contributed to the Brain Chemistry report and will continue to collaborate with the institute on this research.
 As the project continues, we may want to be extra cautious the next time algae is released from Lake O — especially when red tide is present. The state should do its share to support this research while being more open about the dangers blue-green algae presents.

Lo scopo è sviluppare l'abilità della nostra mente di accogliere TUTTI i suoni dalla musica che ascoltiamo, senza fare una selezione o un filtro indipendente dalla nostra volontà.
   
 Questo avviene stimolando, semplicemente con ascolti ripetuti, ogni giorno tre differenti filosofie di interpretazione dei suoni che io ho numerato con 1, 2 e 3 e che corrispondono a tre differenti civiltà etnico/musicali (quella africana ed asiatica - 1, quella europea antica - 2 e quella europea moderna - 3).
   
 Quando tutti i filtri culturali vengono rimossi (o equivalentemente quando li padroneggiamo tutti) l'esperienza di ascolto smette di essere un lavoro cosciente che impegna attivamente la nostra mente, ma diventa una esperienza di "flow", di flusso, quella che molti atleti chiamano trance agonistica.
   
 Il beneficio, al di là del maggiore divertimento nell'ascoltare musica, è una sensazione di maggiore attenzione e concentrazione mentale generalizzata per il resto della giornata, paragonabile ad aver bevuto un forte caffè o una bevanda energizzante.
   
 Ovviamente musicisti ed addetti ai lavori potrebbero beneficiarne, ma è rivolto a tutti, grandi e piccini.

DECATUR, Ala. -- Contamination from a chemical plant in north Alabama is tainting something else -- elections in the city of Decatur.
   
 Three City Council members seeking reelection tell The Decatur Daily that Mayor Tab Bowling and a lawyer are trying to influence August elections by recruiting and funding opponents to the incumbents.
   
 The lawyer, Barney Lovelace, represents the city in lawsuits over chemical contamination from 3M Co.'s Decatur plant. The city is being sued alongside 3M because plaintiffs allege that chemical compounds commonly known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are discharged from the city's wastewater treatment plant and are leaching from its landfill. 3M and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management announced a deal Friday for further cleanup of PFAS, but the lawsuits continue.
   
 Lovelace and Council President Paige Bibbee are at odds after Lovelace said she should recuse herself from discussions of the lawsuits because she's friends with environmentalists and lawyers suing the city or 3M.
   
 On Wednesday, Bibbee played an 82-minute recorded conversation from May in which Lovelace threatens her, saying "I will burn you down" after she offers to make public an email that Lovelace sent regarding the council elections.
   
 The Daily obtained a copy last week of the Jan. 15 email that Lovelace sent to lawyers in his firm discussing finding City Council candidates.
   
 Lovelace wrote that the election is "critical for the future of Decatur" and that he told two Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce officials that he "could not be publicly involved in this effort, but very deep behind the scenes I would help as needed."
   
 He asked that the email not be shared outside the firm "for obvious reasons -- we represent the city in the PFAS litigation and other governmental entities."
   
 Qualifying for the Aug. 25 election ended Tuesday. District 1 incumbent Billy Jackson is the only unopposed council candidate. Bibbee faces three opponents in District 3. District 4 incumbent Charles Kirby has one opponent.
   
 Bibbee, Kirby and Jackson accused Bowling of inviting people to run for City Council.
   
 They said the mayor wants to find candidates who will be more favorable toward him. Bowling has admitted his frustration with the council and its unwillingness to go along with his ideas. Bowling is running for reelection and has six opponents.
   
 Kirby, who has a long history of being critical of Lovelace and even calling for termination of his work on behalf of the city, said he doesn't accept Lovelace's denial.
   
 "It's clear that Tab and Barney are one and the same," Kirby said. "Tab and Barney were working to find opposition for Paige and myself, which is very questionable ethically because Barney gets paid to represent the city."
   
 So far, Lovelace's firm has been paid almost $200,000 in legal fees in the PFAS cases. City Attorney Herman Marks said 3M agreed in mediation to pay the city's legal expenses.
   
 Lovelace denied to Bibbee in the recorded phone call and again to The Daily on Wednesday that the email said he was seeking an opponent to run against her.
   
 Bowling denied recruiting council candidates, but he did say he met with almost every person considering running.
   
 "I probably met with 15 people, but they came to me," Bowling said.
   
 Bowling said it's a coincidence that his campaign consultant is also running the campaigns of three council candidates, including challengers to Bibbee and Kirby.
   
 Jackson, Bibbee and Kirby refused to sign confidentiality agreements regarding the 3M lawsuits. They've also questioned how slow the cases are moving.
