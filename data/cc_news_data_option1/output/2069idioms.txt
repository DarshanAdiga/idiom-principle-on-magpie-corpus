Watertown Police Sgt. John MacLellan, one of the three highest decorated police officers in the country for his valor during a shootout with the Boston Marathon terrorists on April 19, 2013, officially retired at the age of 55 on May 26 in a slightly different way than originally planned.
 According to Chief Michael Lawn, MacLellan was supposed to march in the annual Memorial Day parade and there was a big celebration planned in his honor for May 31. Instead, a ceremony was held outside the police station under sunny skies on May 26. Close to 100 spectators lined the street on either side of the entrance to the Watertown police station driveway as MacLellan, led by two patrolmen on motorcycles, entered the driveway to his ceremony in his SUV cruiser.
 "The thing I'll remember most about John is his heart. He's probably one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life," said Lawn, who has worked with MacLellan for the past 30 years. "He has such a big heart for the less fortunate in town. He embodied what community policing is all about. He did it on and off duty. He has taken so many people under his wing. He still does so much for people that don't have anybody that noone knows about."
 Looking back at his career
 MacLellan, who resides in Newton with his wife of 21 years, Monique, started as a patrolman for the Watertown Police Department on Oct. 1, 1990. He was often seen around town riding a Watertown police motorcycle.
 MacLellan preferred working the nightshift. "I always liked the action of night time," he said.
 He had opportunities over the years to change to the day shift but always refused.
 Community policing is what he is most proud of. He helped start the "Cops and Kids" weightlifting program at Watertown High School 10 years ago. He had to take an accelerated class at Northeastern University to become a certified personal trainer. He said it was the hardest class he ever took because he was under so much pressure to pass.
 "Now that I'm retiring, I'm getting a lot of calls from people I never thought I had any impact on at all who say, 'I can't believe what you did for me when I was a kid.' That is the proudest part of my job. It means a lot to me," said MacLellan. "Anyone can go out and lock up people all night long for OUI or not having a license, but to spend time with people and helmp make them be a better citizen and to become productive and do great in life, that's the important thing a small town cop does."
 A night he remembers vividly
 MacLellan became a sergeant 12 years ago. He was the patrol supervisor the night of April 19, 2013 and said he had no idea the two suspects he was chasing down and in a shoot-out that began on Dexter Avenue were the terrorist brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. He helped Sgt. Jeff Pugliese pin down Tamerlan Tsarnaev just prior to when his younger brother, Dzhokhar, started driving toward them. They managed to get away just before he ran his brother over.
 MacLellan recalls every detail of that night. He said there had to be at least 300 rounds shot. He recalls the vibration from the percussion of the three pipe bombs that were thrown at him, Pugliese and Officer Joe Reynolds. He said at one point he lost focus and had to reholster his gun.
 He recalls worrying about his fellow officers and getting them home safely to their families. He was also worried about the residents in the surrounding neighborhood and keeping them safe.
 Two years after that night, he began to have symptoms of PTSD. For a period of six to seven months, he could not sleep and was having horrible nightmares. He feared his life was ruined forever. He was treated by Dr. John Rodolico at McLean Hospital who he credits for saving his life.
 Awards
 MacLellan, Pugliese and Reynolds received the Presidential Medal of Valor, Congressional Badge of Bravery and George Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 MacLellan said it was a great moment to be a cop when the Watertown Police Department was on the national stage for its work on April 19, 2013, which helped capture the Boston Marathon terrorists. People liked and respected officers after that, he said, recalling the parade in Watertown when people were waving American flags and high-fiving cops.
 "To be part of something like that which brought the community together instead of dividing it. That was a great moment to be a cop," said MacLellan.
 Retirement plans
 MacLellan said his wife is also retiring. He plans to still work details for the Watertown Police Department. He also looks forward to doing more gardening at his home and doing more volunteer work for his church and the St. Vincent De Paul Society, which he is the president of.

May is Mental Health Month and Ohio Hills Health Services (OHHS) is proud to offer Behavioral Health Counseling Services at the Barnesville Family Health Center and the Quaker City Family Health Center. Telehealth counseling sessions are also available for all OHHS patients who are unable to attend an in-person session or who due to COVID-19 feel safer receiving counseling services at home. Behavioral Health Services provide therapeutic interventions for children, adolescents, adults, families and also offers relationship counseling.  
 Behavioral Health Counseling Services are available to all community members. Clients do not need to visit an OHHS health care provider to take advantage of Behavioral Health Services.  
 "OHHS began providing Behavioral Health Counseling one year ago," said Jeff Britton, CEO, OHHS. "We understand the importance of treating the person as a whole and know that at some point in their life an individual may experience grief, anxiety or depression. The COVID-19 pandemic has made Behavioral Health Counseling more important than ever for our community. Our mental health counselors are here to help."  
 The COVID-19 pandemic is a source of stress, fear, or anxiety for many area residents. Nearly half of Americans report the coronavirus crisis is harming their mental health, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. During these uncertain times, if you're scared, depressed, struggling to sleep through the night, or just on edge, you're not alone. It is important to know that help is available.  
 "Counseling can help us to examine what is truly meaningful in our lives," said Melissa Huff, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor, OHHS "I am here to help people discover their best selves."  
 One of the main reasons people do not pursue counseling services is they worry they cannot afford counseling. OHHS accepts Medicaid as well as most insurances and also offers a sliding fee scale for those who qualify. People seek counseling for many different reasons and often counseling is short term, providing clients with the support and coping strategies they need.  
 "Mental Health Month is a great time to bring awareness to the fact that it is OK to seek help. Treating our mental health is as important as treating our physical health. We need to look at healing the person as a whole," said Penny Shepherd, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor, OHHS. "There are practical tools and skills everyone can use to improve their mental health and to build resiliency. A counselor can help you to gradually make small changes and to build on those successes. It is important to recognize and own your feelings, to look for the positive, to connect with others and to create healthy routines. We are here to help you to navigate this course."  
 Mental Health Month provides a great opportunity to educate the community regarding the need and availably of counseling services. OHHS has two Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors, Melissa Huff, LPCC-S and Penny, Shepherd, LPCC-S. To schedule an appointment for Behavioral Health Counseling Services or to request additional information please call 740-239-OHHS.

For folks not ready for the rigor of climbing, Skinner advised people to steer clear of the southern tail of the parkway, where the climbs are intense.
 Her favorite sections include those with rigorous climbs such as the 60-mile stretch from Mount Pisgah, south of Asheville, to Cherokee, the parkway’s southern terminus.
 “It has difficult climbs but the descents are amazing,” said Skinner, 58.
 Another fun stretch is the 18-mile, out-and-back ride from the N.C. Folk Art Center outside of Asheville to Craggy Gardens at milepost 364. The first leg is a steady climb but the descent is a thrill.
 As for safety issues, Skinner said the traffic on weekdays is comparable to traffic on a country road in Stokes or Yadkin counties. Another bonus is the 45 mph speed limit.
 But the parkway also has shaded spots to make it difficult to see cyclists and occasional dense fog.
 “On descents, most vehicles respect that you’ll be going as fast as they are. I typically take the whole lane, and you have to be confident,” she said.
 On ascents, she sticks closer to the white line, acknowledging that cyclists should have some experience on roads before hitting the parkway.
 The Skinners’ book has become a go-to source for people interested in riding the parkway from around the world.
 “It’s in a little niche and has served its purpose,” she said.

Any occupancy limit will come in at a significantly smaller percentage than the 80 or 85 percent required to break even. As Gaulke points out, "if we are in a situation where we're actually only legally allowed to seat 25 percent of them, we're obviously in a deficit there. Even as they relax the restrictions and we move to 50 percent -- that might be a month later -- we're still operating, in a lot of these situations, in a deficit. And so the economics are not in these operators' favor."

As he spent his years behind bars, Williams explained that while he was physically imprisoned, he never let "his mind go to prison."
 Over time, Williams learned about The Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to exonerating the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and advocating for criminal justice reform. In 1995, he wrote to the organization to see if they could help re-examine his case. The Innocence Project responded, and, according to The National Registry of Exonerations, in 1996, the organization filed a motion for DNA testing when it became forensically available.
 Per the Innocence Project, it took over 10 years for Williams to get the testing because he had to wait for the law to catch up with the science. More specifically, Williams waited for Louisiana to pass a law entitling convicted people to access DNA testing after trial to prove innocence. Eventually, DNA testing of the victim's rape kit was completed in 2009, but the male DNA did not match Williams -- it matched the victim's husband and didn't reveal the assailant's identity.
