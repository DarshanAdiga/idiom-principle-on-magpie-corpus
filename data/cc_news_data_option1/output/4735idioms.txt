THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A near-mythical Dutch speedskating race could fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic — even if the looming winter is cold enough to stage it for the first time in more than 20 years, organizers said Thursday.
 The Elfstedentocht, or Eleven Towns Tour, a roughly 200 kilometer (125-mile) speedskating race along frozen canals and lakes in the northern province of Friesland, hasn't been staged since Brussels sprouts farmer Henk Angenent won the last edition on Jan. 4, 1997.
 The event can only go ahead when the ice across the region is thick enough to carry thousands of skaters who take part. It has only been held 15 times since the first official race in 1909 and the gap since the last race is now the longest ever.
 Even if the waters freeze this winter, organizers say they won't be able to stage the race if coronavirus social distancing measures are in force. The Netherlands is currently in a partial lockdown imposed in mid-October.
 The board of the association that manages the race said in a statement that after discussions with local authorities it had “decided that under the current corona measures it is not possible to organize” the race.
 “The moment the measures are relaxed, the situation will be reassessed,” the organizers said.

I think there’s only so much time you should waste on a person who doesn’t have time for you — to say nothing of a person who isn’t particularly kind to you and, after two years, hasn’t integrated you into her life in a meaningful way. I also think you need to ask yourself what’s more likely, IGNORED: your girlfriend — who can’t take your calls now but could take that guy’s in the middle of the night when you two were living together — is living with and working with a guy she knew before moving away or that your girlfriend is living with and working with and fucking with a guy she moved across the country to be with? I think the latter is far more likely. But even if she’s not fucking him — even if she isn’t holding on to you as a backup or doesn’t want to end things because you pay her phone bill — she doesn’t make time for you and it doesn’t sound like she’s particularly kind to when she can spare you a moment. I don’t know why she hasn’t done the right thing and ended it, IGNORED, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do the right thing for yourself and end it.

As Apple sells its first 5G iPhones (all four variants are on sale now), it'll immediately become one of the top 5G phone vendors in the world, even though its first phones didn't hit the market until the fourth quarter.
 This year, Apple will leapfrog Samsung \-- which has about a dozen 5G phone models available and which shipped over half of 2019's 5G units \-- to become the second-largest 5G phone seller after Huawei, according to Strategy Analytics. And next year, Apple will be the world's biggest 5G phone vendor, Strategy Analytics said, shipping an estimated 180 million of 2021's 670 million 5G phones.
 "There's a so-called Apple effect," Strategy Analytics analyst Ville-Petteri Ukonaho said. "Whatever Apple does, it almost immediately becomes a success."
 ## How many iPhone 12 models are there? And how do they differ from earlier iPhones?  
 For the first time ever, Apple is selling four new iPhone models at the same time. It includes the 5.4-inch iPhone 12 Mini, 6.1-inch iPhone 12, 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro and 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. For those keeping track, that's one more iPhone than last year's lineup (the iPhone 11 didn't have a Mini version), and the more premium phones -- the Pro and Pro Max -- get a bump in screen size.
 Last year's new iPhone lineup included the 6.1-inch iPhone 11, the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro and the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max.
 All of the new iPhone 12 models come with 5G connectivity, both in the US and internationally. The superfast millimeter wave 5G connectivity is only available in US models. (Verizon is the technology's main proponent.)
 The entire iPhone 12 lineup also features a new design, reminiscent of Apple's iPad Pro tablets. The flatter sides give the iPhones a new feel for the first time in three years. All models come with a new, ultra-strong, Corning- designed front cover display, dubbed "ceramic shield." It's "tougher than any smartphone glass," Apple said, and is four times less likely to crack if you drop it. The new phones come with Apple's updated A14 Bionic, the same chip that's in the new iPad Air. They also get bumps in their camera capabilities.

We first used it to make whipped cream and meringue with the double whisk attachments, a departure from the single-whisk mixers that made up the bulk of our testing pool. This was a little difficult to manage on the first try, as the two whisks worked with a lot more might and speed than the other mixers’ single whisk. The whipping went surprisingly fast (under three minutes for both whipped cream and meringue), but also sprayed a bit of fluff across the kitchen. After a few tries, we realized it was easier to manage splatter by tipping the bowl sideways.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that it will close the huge telescope at the renowned Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in a blow to scientists worldwide who depend on it to search for planets, asteroids and extraterrestrial life.
 The independent, federally funded agency said it’s too dangerous to keep operating the single dish radio telescope -- one of the world’s largest -- given the significant damage it recently sustained. An auxiliary cable broke in August and tore a 100-foot hole in the reflector dish and damaged the dome above it. Then on Nov. 6, one of the telescope’s main steel cables snapped, causing further damage and leading officials to warn that the entire structure could collapse.
 NSF officials noted that even if crews were to repair all the damage, engineers found that the structure would still be unstable in the long term.
 “This decision is not an easy one for NSF to make, but the safety of people is our number one priority,” said Sean Jones, the agency’s assistant director for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. “We understand how much Arecibo means to this community and to Puerto Rico.”
 He said the goal was to preserve the telescope without placing people at risk, but, “we have found no path forward to allow us to do so safely.”
 The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. In its 57 years of operation, it endured hurricanes, endless humidity and a recent string of strong earthquakes.

Canada had the highest number of winter drownings of all 10 countries analyzed, according to the study. Locations studied in the U.S. included Alaska, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
 In places like Germany and Italy, where there are strong regulations about who can go on ice and for what activities, drownings occurred at lower rates, the study says.
 As temperatures gradually increase due to global warming, lakes, rivers and seas will continue to experience earlier ice break-up, later ice formation, shorter seasons of ice cover and decreases in ice thickness. In some regions, ice cover may not form at all, the researchers said.
 "With warmer winters, ice cover will become more unpredictable, to the extent that a 1°C increase in average annual air temperatures could eliminate consistent lake ice cover for 100 million people who typically have access to a frozen lake," the researchers wrote in their study.
 "Human lives could be saved if considerations of air temperatures integrated throughout the winter were included in individual decision-making and risk calculations on the ice," they added.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden’s meeting Thursday with a group of Democratic and Republican governors is his latest attempt to fight through President Donald Trump’s unprecedented attempt to block the president- elect’s transition to power.President-elect Joe Biden speaks to reporters as he leaves The Queen theater, Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2020, in Wilmington, Del.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris planned a virtual session in the afternoon with the National Governors Association’s leadership team, which includes five Republicans and four Democrats. All the Democrats and a majority of the Republicans involved have acknowledged Biden as the winner of the White House election.One expected participant, Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., told The Associated Press recently that Trump’s wild and unsupported claims of widespread voter fraud were “dangerous” and “embarrassing.” The highest- ranking Republican on the NGA’s executive committee, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, said over the weekend that Biden would be the next president and he called on the Trump administration to give Biden access to the intelligence briefings he needs in order to be fully prepared to lead the country on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.So far, the governors have not swayed the Republican president.Before Biden’s meeting, Trump came out with a new round of false claims of voter fraud in key states, even as courts continue to reject his challenges, and a small, but growing number of Republican officeholders publicly begin to accept Biden’s victory. Beyond being a pillar of democracy, the peaceful transfer of power after an election is especially critical this year given the extraordinary governing challenges Biden will inherit in just nine weeks. The United States is struggling through the worst public health crisis in a century, state and local government are facing massive budget shortfalls, and millions of Americans remain out of work.But more than two weeks after the Nov. 3 election, the Trump administration is refusing to let Biden receive detailed briefings on national security and pandemic planning that leaders in both parties say are vital to ensure Biden can govern effectively on Day One. With Trump dug in and Republicans on Capitol Hill largely unwilling to challenge him, Biden has been forced to turn to diverse collection of outside allies to ratchet up the pressure on Trump to concede.The CEOs of America’s largest companies have released a statement recognizing Biden and Harris as the clear winners. The heads of the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association issued a joint statement on Tuesday urging the Trump administration to share “all critical information related to COVID-19” with Biden. Not doing so, they warned, would jeopardize American lives. Trump is showing no signs of giving in.He is getting nowhere in the courts, and his scattershot effort to overturn Biden’s victory is shifting toward obscure election boards that certify the vote. The battle is centered in the states that sealed Biden’s win. In Michigan, two Republican election officials in the state’s largest county initially refused to certify results despite no evidence of fraud. The officials then backtracked and voted to certify before flipping again on Wednesday and saying they “remain opposed to certification.” Some Republicans have called on the GOP statewide canvassers to so the same as Trump applies pressure from his social media accounts.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, planned to participate in the meeting with Biden. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

“DUI is a serious crime that puts Pennsylvanians at risk every day, but it is also 100 percent preventable,” said Maj. Bruce Williams, director of the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Patrol. “PSP and its local law enforcement partners have zero tolerance toward driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.”
 Drivers are also reminded to obey Pennsylvania’s Move Over Law, which requires drivers to move over or slow down when they encounter an emergency scene, traffic stop, or disabled vehicle. The goal of the Move Over Law is to protect law enforcement, emergency medical providers, and other first responders when responding to crashes.
 “It takes a team effort to keep traffic flowing safely,” said Williams. “First responders — including police, emergency medical technicians, road crews, and tow truck drivers — are at risk when responding to crash scenes, and we can all do our part to keep them safe by obeying the Move Over Law and giving them space to work.”
 Motorists can check conditions on major roadways by visiting www.511PA.com. 511PA, which is free and available 24 hours a day, provides traffic delay warnings, weather forecasts, traffic speed information, and access to more than 1,000 traffic cameras. 511PA is also available through a smartphone application for iPhone and Android devices, by calling 5-1-1, or by following regional Twitter alerts accessible on the 511PA website.

Like many of the new Xbox accessories arriving this month, the Razer Wolverine V2 controller doesn't have any specific ties to the new Xbox Series X and Series S except timing -- it just made sense to update the Wolverine models for 2020. And the result is quite a nice wired controller for Xbox and PC, with a more comfortable grip and better buttons and triggers. The size and layout may not work for all hands, though.
 The Razer Wolverine V2 costs $100 (£100, AU$170) and is available now.
 A little larger than a typical Xbox controller, the Wolverine V2's grips are one of its strengths. They're very comfortable, with a deeper curve than the original, sloped so that your index fingers fall naturally on the triggers rather than overshooting them slightly. And the rubberized surface feels grippy without feeling sticky.
 See at Razer
 The controller's complexity falls somewhere between the bundled Xbox models and the Elite controller. Like the Xbox Elite, Scuf Elite and others, it has trigger stops -- independent physical toggles to set whether you want shallow or deep presses for the left and right triggers. This can be a huge improvement for rapid shooting, or fine control over thrusters in space games such as Outer Wilds, over the seemingly infinitely mashable triggers on most controllers. Unlike those controllers, though, it doesn't have paddles or other programmable switches underneath.

“If there is enough ice and it is possible in relation to corona measures, the board can organize an 11 Towns Tour in 48 hours."
 The approximately 30,000 members of the Royal Association of the 11 Towns Tour are the only skaters allowed to participate in the race. A small group of elite racers competes for the victory, while thousands more follow at a more leisurely pace.
 Just the prospect of the race happening sends the Netherlands into a speedskating frenzy and if it goes ahead, it would likely draw hundreds of thousands of people to Friesland to stand shivering on the banks of the windswept region's waterways to cheer on the skaters.
 That was part of the reason for organizers deciding it is not possible to hold the event with social distancing measures in place.
 “The board believes is is not responsible to organize an event that will attract hundreds of thousands of people, with all the possible consequences for infections,” organizers said. “Finally, the 11 Towns Tour places a large stain on hospitals and medical support. The board believes that also is not responsible given the great strain this sector is currently experiencing.”
 Olympic champion speedskater Sven Kramer said he understood the decision.
 "In some ways it's very logical,” he told national broadcaster NOS. “For the speedskating Netherlands of course, it's a shame. But at the end of the day, there are more important things.”

A new agreement in 2017 extended the naming rights through the 2033 season (it was later revealed CenturyLink paid $162.7 million to keep the rights for an additional 15 years from 2019 to 2033).
 In the statement, the Seahawks said the rebrand to Lumen Field is covered under the existing naming-rights agreement and includes the stadium’s multipurpose event center, which will now be known as the Lumen Field Event Center.
 “Through a shared vision and commitment to serving the Seattle community, we are proud to enter a new era of world-class sports and entertainment with Lumen Field,” Chuck Arnold, president of the Seahawks and First & Goal Inc., said in the statement. “For nearly two decades, the stadium has made its mark as a premier Seattle venue, and a place for the community to experience thrilling victories, establish sacred traditions, and witness unforgettable moments together. We are excited to build upon that legacy and experience amazing things at Lumen Field for years to come.”
 Said Shaun Andrews, Lumen's chief marketing officer, in a statement: “Lumen Field represents more than just a name change; it represents our growing partnership with the Seattle Seahawks and our shared vision of using data and technology to further human progress and produce winning outcomes on and off the field. Lumen Field is a symbol of Seattle’s passionate fans, and we are proud to be associated with this iconic venue. Lumen is dedicated to delivering amazing experiences for our clients, and we are committed to the success and support of the Seattle community.”
 The team's statement also said in-stadium signage replacement is in the early stages, with a goal for all new internal and external branding to be completed in the coming months and before the start of the 2021 NFL season.

At the heart of the dispute is a last-minute compromise between Kinloch and the Republicans to seek a comprehensive audit of results in the Detroit area, where the GOP members said the votes were out of balance — meaning that the poll book, the official list of who voted, didn't match the number of ballots received.
 Palmer and Hartmann said in their affidavits that they believed they had a firm commitment to an audit. But Palmer says in her affidavit that Michigan Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson later said she didn't view their resolution asking for an audit as binding.
 "I felt misled," Palmer told The Post earlier on Wednesday, before signing the affidavit. "I stand firm in not certifying Wayne County without the audit."
 Kinloch, though, said that Palmer and Hartmann knew exactly what they were agreeing to, and that the board has yet to even formally ask Benson for the audit.
 Palmer "knew it wasn't binding," Kinloch said. "We just voted yesterday."
 Kinloch said he and Palmer texted each other into the early hours of Wednesday, with the Democrat explaining that he had support across the board for the request. But he said Palmer was aware that he had not been able to directly reach the secretary of state's office on Tuesday night.

Lastly, the issue of privatisation and the alleged role that HH played is nothing but an old song that is off beat now. It is clear that the Patriotic Front (PF) government today is absolutely in panic and are acting out of desperation to try and do anything and everything in an attempt to pin down their number one opponent so that he cannot be on the ballot next year and the privatisation issue is their only last hope because all other tricks and tactics have failed, including Bill 10. Just as a reminder to our friends in the government, no one can fight the wheels of change once they begin to turn. Therefore, the PF will do well to let fate take its course and allow for the people of Zambia to express themselves freely now and next year during the elections.

"Părinții lui m-au catalogat drept o femeie ușoară. Cat am stat cu el, 8 ani de zile, foarte mult l-am iubit. Enorm de mult. Totul s-a destrămat din cauza dansurilor pentru că eu dansam. Părinților lui nu i-au convenit de mine pentru că eu dansam și ușor, ușor, mă simțeam tot mai singură. Mi-am dat seama că ei nu mă vor pentru că eu după ce am divorțat de el, el tot mai incerca să mai vorbească cu mine. Îmi spunea tot timpul: Vino la ora cutare, seara, lasă mașina mai jos. Mi-am dat seama, e clar că părinții lor chiar nu mă mai vor. Eu iubindu-l foarte mult, am stat și am ținut in mine, pană m-am dat peste cap. Mi-a fost foarte, foarte greu. Mă ustura carnea pe maini.

For what it’s worth, let’s take a short trip down memory lane to remind anyone new to the conversation precisely why Mumia Abu-Jamal is rotting in jail. When U.S. Army veteran and Police Officer David Faulkner was murdered in cold blood in 1981 he was in the process of pulling over Abu-Jamal’s brother for a traffic infraction. Multiple witnesses testified that they saw him shoot Faulkner several times from different ranges. While in the hospital (he was shot himself during the encounter), Abu-Jamal bragged of shooting Faulkner and said that he “hoped he would die.”

The visitor tried to keep a low profile. She was careful to keep her hair tucked in her hat, and she slid down in the backseat of the car to avoid any public notice.
 Still, the mysterious stranger was surprised when her identity was discovered.
 The word quickly spread. Amelia Earhart was in town!
 On May 5, 1934, the famous aviatrix made a stop in Harrison. Along with three friends, Earhart was touring the Ozarks. The party had driven from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and were on their way to Hot Springs.
 Two years prior, “Lady Lindy” as the press dubbed her, had made history by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, making the trip from Newfoundland to Northern Ireland.
 Earhart and her friends stopped at Harrison’s Hotel Seville, where she mailed a postcard.
 When the group discovered that dinner would not be served at the hotel for another hour, they strolled downtown where they had lunch at Mrs. Dunn’s diner. According to an account in the Harrison Daily Times, Earhart loved the cherry pie.
 In addition to her flying exploits, Earhart was very fashion conscious. She was one of the first celebrities to create her own line of women’s apparel. The Daily Times took note of Earhart’s wardrobe during her visit to Harrison.
 “She wore a brown swagger tweed suit, small brown hat, matching silk scarf and brown oxfords,” the paper reported.
 Earhart told the Daily Times that she had been flying quite a bit lately.
 “It’s certainly good to be on the ground again,” she said.
 After lunch, Earhart and her friends left for Russellville.
 On July 2, 1937, a plane being flown by Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean while on an around-the-world flight. The plane and the bodies were never found.

London, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 19th Nov, 2020 ) :Dominic Thiem slumped to defeat against Andrey Rublev in a dead rubber at the ATP Finals on Thursday as reigning champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and Rafael Nadal prepared for a shootout to reach the semi-finals.
 Austria's Thiem, who beat Tsitsipas and Nadal earlier in the week to win Group London 2020, was well below his best at London's empty O2 Arena in a 6-2, 7-5 defeat.
 Rublev, 23, broke the third seed twice to race into a 3-0 lead at the start of the round-robin match.
 Thiem stopped the rot and started holding his serve but could not make inroads into the Russian's serve and the set was over in just 25 minutes.
 US Open champion Thiem, playing significantly below par, tried to dig deep against Rublev, who has had a breakthrough season, winning five titles.
 But the Russian, who was in the groove, passed Thiem in the third game to break for the third time in the match and establish an iron grip.
 Just when it seemed likely he would canter to victory his level dipped and he dumped a forehand into the net to hand Thiem a break, smashing the ball away in frustration.
 At 4-4 the Austrian appeared to be back in the contest but was broken again in the 11th game, sending an angled backhand wide.

As the Dash Mixer only comes with standard beater attachments, we used those to whisk egg whites and whipped cream, and both took just over five minutes and didn’t make any splatter. The cookie dough and cake batter didn’t go as well. The machine lacked the power to mix the heavy ingredients in the dough, and when we plunged the mixer into the ingredients, the dry mix poofed out of the bowl a bit, leaving cookie-mix dust all over the counter. The sponge cake mixing was pretty tedious as it’s hard to set the mixer down while using it due to the cord position. It was difficult to get the batter just right — the sugar just didn’t blend in the way it was supposed to and our cake was dry and a little sad.
