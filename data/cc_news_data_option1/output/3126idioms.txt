A "Camp Fire" in a town called Paradise. At face value, it all sounded so innocent, so bucolic, a Boy Scout's dream. But it was anything but. The events of Nov. 8, 2018, were closer to a hellish scene conjured by Hieronymus Bosch, a flaming purgatory consuming lives and property in wide swaths with ash so thick it rendered morning night. When the smoke cleared, 85 souls were dead and more than 18,000 structures burned to the ground, along with them, the hopes and dreams of the survivors. What would they do next?
 That question intrigued Ron Howard, who as a child spent time in a similarly idyllic town called Mayberry. With camera in hand, he and his crew descended upon Paradise to spend a year watching a community struggling to rise from the ruins. The result is "Rebuilding Paradise," a riveting chronicle of human suffering trumped by the will to pick up the pieces and move forward. You'd think such a project would be inspiring and hopeful, but what Howard finds is something quite different, a wannabe phoenix often futilely flapping its wings into a headwind of stifling government bureaucracy and unforeseen tragedy.
 His focus is on a handful of residents, among them Woody Culleton, a self- described former town drunk who -- unlike Mayberry's Otis -- rose to become mayor of Paradise; Superintendent of Schools Michelle John and her husband, Phil; hunky police officer Matt Gates and his wife, Tenille; and overworked school psychologist Carly Ingersoll. What they all have in common is more than just the loss of their homes.
 Their stories are wrenching, but the emotion stirring you is one of anger rightfully targeted at FEMA, the logging industry and specifically, Pacific Gas and Electric, whose power lines sparked the Camp Fire, so named for its origins on Camp Creek Road. No less than Erin Brockovich arrives in town to stoke up the residents for a litigious fight against the utility monopoly. And what does the Camp Fire, the largest and deadliest blaze in California history, say about Republicans and their refusal to tackle the ever-pressing issue of climate change?
 It's where Howard's film directs its most furious ire, closing out with unforgettable images of the worldwide destruction being caused by the gradual obliteration of the ozone by the fossil fuel industry. It's a stirring montage capped by December's out-of-control wildfires in Australia that killed a billion animals and scorched millions more acres. Ultimately, Howard wants "Rebuilding Paradise" to scare the bejeezus out of us. And all I can say is, mission accomplished.
 In fact, the film's first 10 minutes, chock full of dash-cam footage of the Camp inferno, are scarier than any horror movie I've seen. This should come as no surprise for anyone recalling the realistic scenes of fire Howard depicted in his 1991 blockbuster, "Backdraft." If a filmmaker knows the lethal power of heat and flame, it's Howard. What you don't expect is the amount of emotion he's able to draw from the aftermath of a natural disaster like few have seen. What we witness is not just the leveling of Paradise -- an ideal, like Eden, once again forsaken by God -- but a hole burned clean through your heart. True to Milton's words, it is indeed a Paradise lost.

You never know what will show up.
 Picture this. You are driving down the road with your family on the way to an outing, and see out of the corner of your eye a supercar — one that you either have never seen before or one that you hoped you could experience firsthand or maybe even heard of, but never witnessed.
 That happened today. On my way to work, I saw this bright Ludus Blue mid- engine supercar zoom by me on the highway and could only think of one thing; that guy is either a big executive, or just out loving life. As I pull into the office parking lot, I see the same Ludus Blue supercar that I wasn't able to identify in the 2.8 seconds it took for him to fly by me previously.

ALMA -- Sidney Hatley is putting on a brave face. She knows what question is coming.
   
 COVID-19 is still here.
   
 "It's always there," she said. "I sure hope we get to play, but it's something you worry about."
   
 To say it's been an odd year is like saying it might snow later this month.
   
 But Hatley, her blond hair piled on top of her face, her eyes glistening in the bright lights beaming down at Charles B. Dyer Arena is focused on the light at the end of the tunnel -- not what's behind.
   
 As of Friday, Alma is still planning to face Springdale and Huntsville in a tri-match Aug. 20.
   
 Because of health concerns over COVID-19 and the spread of the deadly coronavirus, Hatley and other area volleyball players missed out on most of the junior olympic volleyball spring season.
   
 "I understand why we couldn't play, (but) sitting around the house and seeing other sports (baseball and softball play full summer seasons), it is frustrating," she said. "It reminds me of when I hurt my shoulder. Seeing people play when you can't is frustrating. It made me more excited, I guess. It's a break I didn't want, but I got more excited and energetic for the fall -- that I hope we get to have.
   
 "This makes you appreciate things and not take things for granted."
   
 It didn't take first-year coach Kim Weaver long to figure out Hatley wasn't just one of her returning starters in the fold, but someone who she could trust to do the right thing on and off the court.
   
 "She makes the Alma School District better," Weaver said. "I think she (Hatley) was one of the first players to really catch my attention and make me pause and say, 'Hey, we can build something around Sidney.'
   
 "She's a big part of who we are."
   
 "I love coach Weaver," Hatley said. "I've already learned so much, but I also love the psychological side that she brings. When we were quarantined, she was sending us videos over the mindset of the athlete. One word she really focuses on is grit. That's something she talks about. Even if we don't win a game, She wants us to keep pushing."
   
 Weaver brought in longtime UAFS volleyball coach Jane Sargent last week for an impromptu camp. Hatley was paying attention.
   
 "One thing she talked about was losing and getting better," Hatley said. "It's easy to get used to losing instead of getting beat, which is what we did a lot of last year. We lost instead of getting beat. I'm excited with the accountability she (Weaver) expects from us and how much she's teaching us -- that's really cool."
   
 The 5-foot-9 Hatley played libero last season. Weaver, however, isn't ruling out a position change.
   
 "We are going to do whatever we need to do to make Sidney part of every play," Weaver said. "We're not putting her in a box as if to say, 'Ok, this is where we want you to play.' We're trying to give her some reps on the front row too. She has those utility player attributes, but at the same time she can take ownership wherever she is."
   
 "I've played a lot of positions over the years -- middle, back row and wherever they need me," Hatley said. "It really doesn't matter what position I play, I just enjoy the sport."
   
 Hatley admits prior to seventh grade she didn't know much about volleyball. It didn't take her long, though, to fall in love with the sport.
   
 "Before seventh grade, I had no idea what volleyball was about. I might have heard of it, but I joined and I instantly loved it," she said. "I don't know what it was about it exactly. The game itself is my favorite thing to do. It's oddly weird, but it takes away my stress, even though some moments can be stressful."
   
 Wearing the jersey nearly brings a tear to Hatley's eyes.
   
 "Coming here and seeing the older kids play when I was younger, the fact that I'm here now is just surreal," she said. "It's crazy that I was once that little kid watching, and now I am the older kid. I love Alma volleyball because of the community support; we're all very close to each other. The support from our family, our teammates and our coaches is something that sets Alma volleyball apart from others."

Like too many tour pros, the guy leading the PGA Championship after two rounds is not above letting his clubs do the talking. What makes Li Haotong stand out from the crowd is what one of those clubs says about him.
 "HAOTONG IS THE MOST HANDSOME MAN IN CHINA," reads the stamp — in red capital letters, no less — on the back of Li's 60-degree wedge.
 While that remains open to debate, the fun-loving 25-year-old is definitely the first Chinese player to hold the lead after any round in a major championship, thanks to a bogey-free 65 Friday that left him two shots clear of the field at 8-under 132. Any doubts Li has enough guts or firepower to contend on the weekend at a toughening TPC Harding Park course should have been vaporized when posted shot 63 in the final round of the British Open over a similarly cool, windy Royal Birkdale layout three years ago to finish third.

WAYCROSS, Ga. (WTOC) -An investigation is underway in Waycross after a police officer fired multiple shots at a moving car on Saturday. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was requested to assist in the case on behalf of the Waycross Police Department. Information obtained by the GBI reports that an officer with the Waycross Police Department observed a traffic violation at the intersection of Howe and Brunell Street around 8 a.m. The officer attempted to take down the car’s license plate number. As the car approached the area of Walters and Greenwood Street, three children aged nine, 12, and 14 exited and ran away.A second officer responded to assist as the first officer followed the three children in his car. The car began to move towards the second officer, prompting him to fire multiple shots until two minors aged 15 and 16 exited. An altercation between the officer and 15-year- old led to the youth being restrained in handcuffs. He received treatment for minor injuries. The first officer returned to the scene after hearing gunshots. The three minors went home. No officers were injured. The GBI will continue their independent investigation.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

Maurizio Sarri believes Juventus are "cursed" in the Champions League after their exit at the hands of Lyon on Friday.
 Cristiano Ronaldo's brace helped Juve to a 2-1 win in Turin, but they fell in the last-16 tie on away goals after a 2-2 aggregate draw.
 Memphis Depay had given Lyon the lead in the second leg before Ronaldo's double, with Juve's wait for a first Champions League title since 1996 to go on.
 Sarri, who is under increasing pressure at the helm, said the Serie A champions were cursed in the competition.
 "We are out of a competition where we won six out of eight games we played, we drew one and lost one. That means that in eight matches we got 19 points," he told a news conference.
 "If there were a Champions League table we would be first or second. Instead, we are out. That's why I feel incredibly sad. It makes me understand that in this competition Juventus are cursed.
 "If I weren't so bitter, I would get out of this match with a smile on my face, because I saw the lads in good shape again, they gave all they had, they fought until the end, they put their heart and soul into the match. I appreciated it."
 Lyon and Juventus were both awarded controversial penalties during the second leg, with Depay and Ronaldo converting.
 Sarri felt the spot-kick given to Lyon was "crazy" as he rued the first-leg away loss.
 "We played a good match. In a match where we had to come from behind, we found ourselves one goal down because of a crazy penalty, because in my opinion it shouldn't even have arrived to the box because I think there was a clear enough foul on [Gonzalo] Higuain. And the penalty itself I think it is debatable," he said.
 "The referee was clearly unfit for a situation like this, because for us to concede that goal was like to concede two goals. We were good because we stayed into the game and turned the match around, but we spent a lot of energy.
 "We had two or three chances to score towards the end with headers from Cristiano Ronaldo, Higuain and I think [Leonardo] Bonucci, so I think we were close to the qualification.
 "If we have to have a regret it has to be for our performance in the first half at Lyon. At these levels, it is something you pay for."
