Palace aren't like Manchester City or Manchester United in having a bottomless pit of money, and so when they do make a splash in the transfer market, there really is no room for failure.

In a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19, the Oklahoma prison system has locked its doors to newly sentenced prisoners from county jails from around the state.
 Prison officials across the United States are taking steps to keep the virus from spreading rapidly behind bars, ranging from halting in-person visits and screening correctional officers for signs of illness. In Arizona, state officials announced a plan to stop charging inmates for soap and waiving healthcare fees.
 Depending on how long the crisis lasts, it could cause a logjam at Oklahoma’s two largest county jails in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

OMAHA – In light of the national shortage of single-use personal protective equipment, Nebraska Medicine has developed a safe and effective method to decontaminate these items so they can be used multiple times, instead of just once, according to a press release from Nebraska Medicine.
 A team led by John Lowe, PhD, UNMC assistant vice chancellor for inter- professional health security training and education, is using ultraviolet light towers to irradiate high numbers of masks, which were originally designed to only be used once. The strategy will allow Nebraska Medicine to greatly extend its supply of these items during the coronavirus pandemic.
 “The shortage of PPE is a nationwide issue – each and every one of these items is increasingly precious,” said Mark Rupp, MD, chief of the infectious diseases division at UNMC. “Although we were well prepared, our supplies were beginning to dwindle. We had to find a way to keep our providers and patients safe, and this will definitely help us achieve that goal.”

“History doesn’t repeat itself—it doesn’t. Never once has history repeated itself,” Burns defined. “But as Mark Twain is supposed to have said, history rhymes. If we played to those rhymes, it would be foolish. It would destroy our story—we might as well just do a contemporary issue. But what we find is that, by doing history well, you have a chance to bring up these evergreen topics, whatever it might be. I go back to Ecclesiastes in the Bible, and it says, ‘What has been, will be again. What has been done, will be done again.’ That suggests to me that human nature doesn’t change—good and bad. It superimposes itself over the seemingly random chaos of human events. We see echoes and ghosts and themes and evergreen topics. With human beings, if you believe Ecclesiastes, there’s nothing new under the sun.”

Se cierran "en todo el territorio nacional todas las actividades productivas no necesarias e indispensables para garantizar servicios esenciales (...), continuaran abiertos supermercados y negocios alimentarios de primera necesidad", señalo.
 Tambien seguiran abiertas las farmacias, parafarmacias, los servicios bancarios, postales, de aseguradoras y servicios publicos esenciales como el transporte.
 La decision del Gobierno de Roma se anuncia despues de que este sabado Proteccion Civil informara de que Italia contabiliza ya 4.825 fallecidos con coronavirus, 793 mas en 24 horas, y el numero total de contagios es de 53.578, contando con los muertos, los enfermos actualmente y los curados.
 Subrayo que todas las empresas deben fomentar el teletrabajo y que solo continuaran trabajando los empleados que realicen actividades "relevantes para la produccion nacional" en fabricas de todo el pais.
 "Ralentizamos el motor de Italia, pero no lo detenemos", apunto, consciente de que las regiones mas castigadas son Lombardia, Emilia Romaña y Veneto, que juntas representan el 40 % del producto interior bruto (PIB).
 El primer ministro tambien se refirio a la polemica desatada en el pais despues de que algunas regiones como Veneto (norte) hayan decidido cerrar los supermercados los domingos y los dias de fiesta para evitar concentraciones de gente.
 Algunos en el pais estan en contra de esta propuesta, como el ex primer ministro y lider de la gobernante Italia Viva, Matteo Renzi, que ha dicho que seria un error porque crearia largas colas y se incrementaria el riesgo de contagios.
 "No hay ninguna restriccion a los dias de apertura de supermercados, invito a todos a mantener la calma, no hay necesidad de acudir en masa y crear largas colas", argumento.
 Conte animo a todos los italianos a respetar "las normas, con paciencia, responsabilidad y confianza" para que el numero de contagios disminuya, y reconocio que "quedarse en casa no es facil" pero que es la unica solucion para proteger las vidas de todas las personas.
 "Nuestro sacrificio de quedarnos en casa es minimo comparado con el que hacen otros ciudadanos, trabajadores en hospitales, miembros de las fuerzas del orden, empleados de supermercados y servicios publicos. Hombres y mujeres que no solo van a trabajar, sino que cumplen cada dia con un acto de gran responsabilidad hacia la nacion", concluyo.
