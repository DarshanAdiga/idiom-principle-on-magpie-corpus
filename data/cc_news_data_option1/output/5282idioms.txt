This move is an attempt to restart such opaque practices in the name of the COVID-19 pandemic. The precise connection between COVID-19 and such a discretionary quota is unclear and entirely questionable; in fact, it seems to be just an alibi for satisfying vested interests,'' the letter said. ''It is relevant to point out that when DU did not care to advise the colleges for reducing the fees, where in the context of COVID 19 so many people are under financial fragility and precariousness, such discretionary admissions to candidates without any connection to COVID 19 whatsoever is a selective and ironical proposition, to say the least,'' it said. The letter by the Academic Council members further claims that this policy seriously compromises the transparency and probity in the admission process. Candidates with lower cut- offs will be allowed admission by the administrators at different levels, it said, adding that the High Court of Delhi had categorically ruled against such discretionary admissions by the Governing Bodies of the colleges and thus had put an end to the so-called management quota. The AC members also claimed that the quota has been approved without placing the issue before the council.

When finding penny stocks to buy, make sure you assess each trade independently and plan accordingly. Most wouldn't plan on investing in penny stocks that are rising and falling 50% in seconds. Furthermore, day traders wouldn't normally jump into a stock that is barely fluctuating in price. As a rule of thumb, the lower the price, the higher the volatility. That's simply for the fact that a small move in price equates to a larger percentage change. With this in mind are any of these penny stocks under $1 on your watch list right now?

It is quite easy to say that we believe these, but when we are faced with severe hardships or illnesses within ourselves or within our loved ones, they become problematic.


  This is especially true today because we are facing a surge in the virus. What makes this even more difficult is that health officials are predicting that this situation will get much worse and could even get out of control with more of us becoming infected and losing our lives or the lives of our loved ones.


  This is the case because of the action of many of us during Thanksgiving celebrations and the behavior of many that will take place during the Christmas season. As we have seen, millions did not follow the advice of health professionals to stay home during Thanksgiving. They also gathered with others from different households. Further, many people did not wear masks — or wear them properly — and maintain at a distance from others.


  It is extremely difficult for many to accept and abide by the recommendations during the holidays when they are used to gathering with family and friends.


  All people of faith need to comply with the recommendations of the health officials, and cling even more strongly to their faith and belief that God is still with them, will never forsake them, and will do what is best for them in the long run.


  We should also remember that we are commanded to love our neighbor as ourselves. This means that we are expected to do what we can for the common good.


  Christians also need to remember that we are told that we will face troubles and difficulties during our lives. That is, rain falls on everyone the same way, no matter what they believe. As a result, many Christians have contracted the virus and some have died.


  However, if we continue to have faith, we will still be taken care of, no matter what happens, whether we live or whether we die. This is the promise of God through his son, Jesus Christ, whose birth we celebrate.


  The hope for all of us, regardless of our beliefs, is that the vaccines will be effective and available for all very soon.


  We must remember that God loves everyone, and he sent his son, Jesus Christ into the world to save all of us. This is truly the meaning of Christmas and our hope for a safe and prosperous future.

The Los Angeles Dodgers are signing free agent reliever Tommy Kahnle to a two- year deal, The Athletic reported Wednesday.
 MLB Network said the contract is valued at $5.25 million.
 The 31-year-old right-hander spent the past three-plus seasons with the New York Yankees.
 He is coming off Tommy John surgery on his right elbow in August and is expected to miss most or all of the 2021 season.
 Kahnle made only one appearance in 2020, allowing one hit and one walk with three strikeouts in one inning in a 3-2 win at Washington on July 26.
 He declined an outright assignment by the Yankees and became a free agent on Oct. 31.
 Kahnle owns a career record of 9-9 with four saves and a 3.82 ERA in 285 bullpen appearances with the Colorado Rockies (2014-15), Chicago White Sox (2016-17) and Yankees. He has struck out 344 batters and walked 132 in 277 2/3 innings.

New England Patriots quarterbacks coach Jedd Fisch will replace Kevin Sumlin as head coach at Arizona, the school announced Wednesday.
 "We are tremendously excited to have Jedd Fisch come to Tucson to reinvigorate our football program and lead us to championships," athletic director Dave Heeke said in a news release. "Jedd has a unique ability to teach the game of football effectively to his players and to inspire them with his passion. We conducted a comprehensive national search with an impressive array of candidates but in the end, Jedd is exactly what our program needs right now and I cannot wait to partner with him to move us forward."
 Contract terms were not announced.
 Fisch, 44, joined Bill Belichick's staff in New England this season after a stint as the Los Angeles Rams' assistant offensive coordinator in 2019.
 His coaching resume, which goes back to the late 1990s, includes a previous stop in the Pac-12 at UCLA. He was the Bruins' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2017, taking over as interim coach for the final two games that season after Jim Mora was fired.
 Fisch's collegiate coaching experience includes time at his alma mater, Florida, as well as at Minnesota, Miami (Fla.) and Michigan. His other NFL stops include the Houston Texans, Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks and Jacksonville Jaguars.
 This is his first permanent head coaching position.
 "I am honored and humbled to lead the University of Arizona football program," Fisch said. "I am 100 percent committed to building a program that all Wildcat fans will be proud to support. We will study hard, compete hard, recruit hard and be relentless in all aspects of our program."
 Arizona axed coach Sumlin on Dec. 12, a day after the Wildcats were crushed, 70-7, by rival Arizona State. It was Arizona's 12th straight loss, the longest skid in school history. Sumlin left with a 9-20 record in three seasons in Tucson, including 0-5 in 2020.
 The hiring drew Belichick's endorsement.
 "Jedd Fisch is one of the most outstanding coaches I have worked with and was an excellent addition to our staff this year," he said. "Jedd has gained a wealth of experience in numerous organizations, in college and the NFL, and is ready to lead the Arizona program."

Louisiana-Monroe named former Auburn coach Terry Bowden as its next head coach, the school announced Wednesday.
 Contract details are not finalized, according to the announcement, and the move is still pending approval by the University of Louisiana System's Board of Supervisors.
 Bowden spent the past two seasons as an unpaid graduate intern on coach Dabo Swinney's staff at Clemson, a position Bowden said he took to refresh his coaching education.
 "We're extremely excited to welcome Terry Bowden to our Warhawk family as head football coach," said athletic director Scott McDonald in a release. "He brings a winning pedigree to our program. He has won at all levels of college football, beginning as the youngest head coach in the country in his first job at Salem College and continued that through his tenure at Samford and Auburn, where he consistently competed for SEC Championships. He followed with success at North Alabama and at Akron, where he led the Zips to their first bowl victory in school history."
 Bowden was hired as Auburn's coach in 1993, and the Tigers finished 11-0 that season. He was named Coach of the Year and was fired in 1998 after the team started the season 1-5.
 He returned to the Division I ranks in 2012 and coached Akron to a 35-52 record before being fired in December.
 Overall, his record as an FBS head coach is 82-69-1. He also coached at North Alabama, Samford and Salem.
 "I got introduced to ULM back after the 2015 season when a contingent flew up to Akron and talked to me about the job," Bowden said in the release. "They did a great job of selling me on the potential of this program and the commitment they had to turning it around.
 "Although the timing just wasn't quite right, I did remember feeling that with my success at places like this, and my desire to get back down South to a college town very much like Auburn and Clemson, that this was a perfect place for me to be. I felt then that I was the best guy they could find to build a winner at ULM and I still do."
 Bowden, 64, will replace Matt Viator, who was fired after the Warhawks posted an 0-10 record. His first duty will be to rebuild the roster of the Sun Belt Conference team, which saw 24 players enter the transfer portal before the season.
 Bowden played at West Virginia and began his coaching career in 1982 as a graduate assistant to his father, the legendary Bobby Bowden, at Florida State.
 His older brother, Tommy, was Clemson's head from 1999 until 2008, when he was fired six games into the season and replaced by Swinney.
 Terry Bowden has said that he wanted to return to head coaching and thought his experience at Clemson would help. But it turned out to be more than educational.
 "It's been one of the greatest experiences of my life," Bowden told The State in Columbia, S.C., before last year's College Football Playoff championship game. "Getting back to sitting in front of a camera and studying football again, with a bunch of great people and great analysts and being a small part, I've really enjoyed it. I think most of us who are fortunate enough to still be in this game at my age just enjoy it. They do a lot more for me probably than I'm doing for them, and I'm very thankful for that."

Markram, 26, was earmarked early in his career as a future Test captain, but the poor form in a turbulent 18 months where he lost his place in the side means he is back to square one and looking to reignite his career.
 White-ball skipper Quinton de Kock has agreed to lead the Test team for the 2020-21 international season until a long-term appointment can be made, and Markram is concentrating only on scoring runs before thinking of anything else.
 "In terms of captaincy, it is something I really enjoy doing, but I have not put much focus on that," Markram told reporters on Wednesday.
 "I am playing for my spot again, so for me to be thinking about the captaincy is certainly not on my radar. I haven’t been good enough over the past 18 months."

 He feels the time away from international cricket, brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, could turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
 "I played a lot of cricket where I was struggling, so I didn't have time to reflect on things that maybe worked in the past and just slow things down," he said.
 "It felt like everything was becoming more and more rushed, and when you are out of form it is a tough place to be. It can be a snowball effect. So that time we had off was great to clear the mind.

You should have free education at least to secondary school level. For tertiary institution, you need to make an arrangement like the United Kingdom and United States of America, where you give some brilliant students scholarship, but should have what I call school soft loan where every child who is from a poor family can have access to loan so that he can finance his tuition fees, his maintenance allowances and when he graduates and starts doing something he can start to pay in 10, 15 to 25 years. This is what is obtainable in the Western world. The type of education we are giving our children is also nothing to write home about because every child now will be targeting to have a certificate just to get employment. That is not a good one. You have to give them education. If somebody, for example, is going for a degree in agriculture, he should specialize in poultry, fishery, crop production, animal husbandry and any area of agriculture so that he can have access to loan when he graduates from Development Bank, Bank of Industry so that he can establish a small business that he can even employ others. So, these are the kind of areas that one can touch. It seems simple but it needs a lot of efforts, bringing talent together so that you can have a team that can drive these issues.

Georgia and Cincinnati began the 2020 season with aspirations of spots in the College Football Playoff.
 A Peach Bowl meeting in Atlanta on Jan. 1 is expected to draw a lot of attention nationally and represents a worthy consolation prize.
 Cincinnati won the American Athletic Conference title to finish the regular season 9-0. The Bearcats remain the subject of debate as to whether the undefeated conference champions were deserving of finishing among the top four teams in the CFP after Notre Dame was soundly defeated by Clemson in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game.
 The Bearcats finished No. 8, well out of the running to become the first non- Power 5 team to make the playoff. They were the highest Group of 5 team, ahead of unbeaten and No. 12 Coastal Carolina (11-0), so the Bearcats received the opportunity to play in a New Year's Six game.
 "It's huge for our program," Cincinnati coach Luke Fickell said. "If you want to claim you deserve an opportunity or a shot, this is an opportunity, this is a shot.
 "Our guys are incredibly excited. I want to make sure everybody knows, there's no disappointment over here. We are incredibly happy and excited to be where we are."
 Cincinnati defeated then-No. 23 Tulsa, 27-24, on a game-winning field goal in the AAC championship game on Saturday, giving the Bearcats their third win over a ranked team. Cincinnati also beat then-No. 22 Army, 24-10, and then-16th-ranked SMU, 42-13.
 The Bearcats are led by quarterback Desmond Ridder, the AAC offensive player of the year who has 2,090 passing yards, with 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He has rushed for 609 yards and a team-high 12 scores. Seven Bearcats have at least 186 yards and a touchdown receiving, led by Josh Whyle's 318 yards and five scores. Gerrid Doaks has rushed for a team-high 673 yards.
 A New Year's Six game is nothing new for No. 9 Georgia (7-2). This is the fifth consecutive year under coach Kirby Smart that the Bulldogs will play in a New Year's Six Bowl or the CFP.
 Georgia, which saw its streak of playing in three straight Southeastern Conference title games end this year, was essentially eliminated from CFP consideration with a 44-28 loss to then-No. 8 Florida on Nov. 7. Georgia also lost at then-No. 2 Alabama, 41-24, on Oct. 17, though the Bulldogs are the lone team to lead the Crimson Tide at halftime this season.
 "I'll be honest, when your intention is to win the game, that's not going to change between his guys and your guys," Smart said. "Every coach is going to try to find an angle that gives their guys an edge or competitive advantage, whether that's them being ranked ahead of us or whatever. I don't know Group of Five, Power 5, all those languages, that's for (media). My language is football, and they've got a good team. They haven't been beaten."
 The Bulldogs played quarterback carousel this season.
 Georgia opened with D'Wan Mathis, shifted to Stetson Bennett and settled on JT Daniels, a highly touted transfer from Southern California. Daniels has energized what had been a stagnant offense that relied too much on its rushing attack led by Zamir White (730 yards, 10 TDs), James Cook (303 yards, three TDs) and Kenny McIntosh (234 yards, one TD).
 Starting in the past three games, Daniels has thrown for 839 yards, nine touchdowns and an interception in wins over Mississippi State, South Carolina and then-No. 25 Missouri. Georgia averaged 41.6 in those games after the Bulldogs scored at least 40 just once in the previous six games.
 Daniels will be challenged by a Cincinnati defense that finished the regular season No. 7 in points allowed (16.0) and 10th in yards (310.8).
 "This gives a well-rounded Cincinnati team their chance to dance against a Power 5," Peach Bowl president Gary Stokan said. "As we've seen in our two previous matchups, Houston won against Florida State from the ACC and UCF won against Auburn from the SEC. But on the other side, I really think Georgia's hitting its stride and is getting some high-scoring offense and playing great on defense."

GARY, Ind. (AP) — A cousin of a murder suspect who escaped earlier this month from a security company’s transport van in northwest Indiana has been charged with assisting a criminal after authorities say he tried to collect money for his fugitive relative. Lake County prosecutors allege in a probable cause affidavit that 22-year-old Antorries Brown posed as his cousin, Leon Taylor, while communicating with an undercover officer on Facebook and asked the officer to send him money so he could “make a move." Taylor escaped Dec. 14 in Gary from a Green Bay, Wisconsin, security company's van as he was being extradited to Lake County from Texas.

The New Jersey Devils re-signed restricted free agent goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood to a three-year, $8.4 million contract, the team announced Wednesday.
 Blackwood, 24, will earn $1.475 million in 2020-21, $2.8 million in 2021-22 and $4.125 million in the final season.
 "Mackenzie is going to be one of the key young, core pieces for this organization for a long time and we are excited and extremely happy to have him under contract," executive vice president/general manager Tom Fitzgerald said in a team statement. "He's obviously shown that he can be a number one goalie, and the sky's the limit for him."
 The Devils selected Blackwood in the second round of the 2015 NHL Draft. He has played 70 games with New Jersey, posting a 32-24-8 record with a 2.72 goals-against average, a .916 save percentage and five shutouts.
 After making his debut on Dec. 18, 2018, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Blackwood usurped Cory Schneider as the starter and enters the new season as the unquestioned No. 1 in goal.
 Last season, he went 22-14-8 in 47 games (43 starts) and had a 2.77 GAA. He finished sixth in voting for the Calder Trophy, signifying the NHL's rookie of the year.

Gleb says he wants nothing more than to be in a mature, healthy co-parenting situation with Elena.
 "Elena told me, 'After this divorce, I'm gonna skin you. I'm gonna take everything you have, even your kids, and make you walk back to Russia where you come from.' Those were her exact words," Gleb claims. "She wants me to lose my job. She wants me to lose everything, because she's just very jealous and she cannot stand the fact that I finally found the inner strength to say, 'Enough.'"
 Gleb says he has received tremendous support from his fellow pros and _DWTS_ family throughout this difficult time, including Artem Chigvintsev, whom Elena claimed he had a falling out with over the split. When a fan asked Elena during an Instagram Live earlier this month if Gleb and Artem were still close, she alleged that Gleb and Artem (who is engaged to Nikki Bella) were no longer on the same page with life. Gleb refutes this outright.
 "I've known Artem for a very long time. We're, like, best, best, best friends," Gleb explains. "I've spoken with Artem and he was very supportive. He was like, 'Dude, I know, this is what it is.' He's seen our vibes for so many years, literally since we were married. He's seen all of it, and he has always been on my side."
 "I have also received so many messages from Lindsay [Arnold], Witney [Carson], Jana [Kramer], Peta [Murgatroyd] and Keo, my best friend, obviously supports me," he continues.
