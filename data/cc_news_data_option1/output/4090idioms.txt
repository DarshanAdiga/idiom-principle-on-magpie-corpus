Crispe, now 42, wasn’t always a consummate hiker. “I played in a band for 15 years which kept me out of the woods. When I stopped doing music, I got more into outdoor exploring. As I saw society get deeper into the digital word—the box, the cell, the screen—that prompted me to get out all the more. People forget what a tree looks like. I feel like it’s not good for the soul to get disconnected from the natural world.”

There's a lot of cynicism. And I think that's extremely corrosive to democracy because it really is, at the end of the day — we've seen so many of the guardrails of democracy fall, particularly with this presidential administration — at the end of the day, it's what protects us from tyranny. And the framers understood that. But if we don't go to the polls to protect democracy itself, it could fail. And I believe that's what's on the ballot in November. Regardless of where you are in the political spectrum, if you like a functioning democracy, get out and actually cast a ballot even if you've never done it before — and save that system for our children and grandchildren.

 Teachers are a keystone of the nation's economic recovery. We need to return to classrooms so that students can learn, and parents can return to work.
 Yet, across the country students, teachers and families are in limbo, contending with virtual schooling, which isn't an ideal learning environment.
 To get teachers like me safely back in schools as soon as possible, we must reduce the risk of spreading this disease to our colleagues and students. I want to get back in the classroom just as much as the families whose kids I teach. By routinely taking COVID-19 tests, even if asymptomatic, we can reduce the school outbreak risk that would significantly set back reopening timelines.
 A major barrier to achieving this testing peace of mind is the lack of cost certainty around COVID-19 diagnoses. If teachers like me have to worry that COVID-19 tests might generate ruinous medical bills, we will be far less likely to get the care we need and our students deserve. Testing price transparency is the solution.
 I speak from personal experience. This spring, I tried to get a COVID-19 test but didn't fit the profile required to receive one at the time. Instead, I was forced to go to the ER to get a chest X-ray, but I also received an EKG, IV fluids, a flu test and a pregnancy test, because I was in rough shape when I arrived. I was hit with $4,500 worth of associated bills, brought down to $3,200 by insurance, in the ensuing weeks. (It turned out that I had contracted COVID-19. While my medical health has recovered, my financial health has not. Fighting these bills has been a part-time job in and of itself.)
 I'm not alone. There are countless stories of patients like me who are denied COVID-19 tests, yet receive five-figure bills for other related exams. Patients who do receive COVID-19 tests have been charged roughly $6,500. While these bills are outliers, tests regularly range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
 According to a Gallup Poll, nearly one in six Americans with COVID-19 symptoms would not get tested for fear of unknown costs. Hidden health care prices are, therefore, not only a financial threat but also a public health menace. Hidden prices will delay the safe reopening of classrooms and the associated economic growth.
 If teachers -- and all Americans -- knew exactly what they had to pay for a COVID-19 test and that they wouldn't be subject to additional related charges, more people would get tested and fewer would get infected. This price certainty would give us the freedom and control to get tested when and where we want.
 Health care price transparency offered systemwide can provide health care consumers with cost certainty over all their care, ending the bizarre status quo where patients are blinded from prices until they receive their bills in the mail weeks and months after treatment.
 Price transparency can also lower runaway health care costs. With access to real prices, patients can shop around for less expensive care and find better value the same way we do for auto repair, hair styling and life insurance.
 Empowering patients with prices will enable us to steer clear of price-gouging providers who charge $6,500 for COVID tests, $20,000 for broken arms or $600 for Band-Aids. Vast price differentials for the same health care services in the same market will converge. Ensuing market competition will put further downward pressure on prices.
 According to a recent nationwide poll, nearly 90% of Americans and 98% of women under the age of 40 support this commonsense reform. Almost no other issue in today's politically polarized environment enjoys such overwhelming bipartisan support.
 By providing COVID-19 testing cost certainty to teachers, health care price transparency can make classrooms safer and return children faster, allowing parents to return to work, boosting the economic recovery.
 Just like how students rely on teachers to provide them with knowledge, teachers and all Americans need health care price information.

In 2011, I was contacted by UCI asking if I would be on an athlete advisory commission so I realized I hadn’t pissed them off too much. In 2013, I got a spot on the mountain bike commission and one of the first issues I brought up was making the prizes the same for men and women. In mountain biking, the disparity wasn’t as great with women making maybe $520 when men made $600. I thought that would be a great first step and it was one of the first things I brought up. I was the only woman on the commission but when I said we should have equal prize money, they all agreed. I was expecting more of a fight.

But Kaine acknowledged that for some Democrats, complaining about executive overreach might be a matter of what he called "situational ethics." There's a possibility, he said, that they might turn a blind eye if presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins office. "When I was raising real concerns about President Obama's decision to unilaterally engage in military activity, Democrats in my own Senate caucus were basically yelling at me and telling me to knock it off," Kaine said.

And Nason said members of MPD150, some of whom are also in the Black Visions Collective, helped draft the statement that the City Council members read when they pledged to abolish the police at the rally in the park earlier this month.

This is not something that has been a concern by these states that vote almost exclusively by mail and actually the residents of those states really like it. It's very convenient, even in the age without a massive pandemic. It also increases voter participation on both sides of the political spectrum. It benefits Democrats and it also benefits Republicans. And I think in light of the absence of evidence backing up the president's claim, what you have to ask, is this president trying to win the election by keeping people home, not by actually giving people a reason to vote for him, and that keeping people home is a tactic that even we know the Russians used in 2016 and continue to use to this day, as does Iran and China, other countries.

What I am saying is that provincial government has been weirdly selective, rolling back openings -- for 28 days (at least) -- on the back of a hospitality industry that was just scraping by, with dozens of businesses already gone toes up. Why bars and not retail stores; why gyms and not the LCBO; why theatres and not construction sites, where I've never seen anyone wearing a mask.

Mountain biking became the first UCI discipline to have equal prize money in all races. There has been progress in cyclocross and hopefully road and other disciplines. I hope that mountain biking can provide a template so the others can follow suit. For me it was a question of doing something to move in the right direction but not knowing if I was going to get any traction. You never know what will happen. Sometimes you just have to be the person in the room. I wasn’t a pioneer. I just said something. It’s not like I was working tirelessly but sometimes just saying something is enough.
