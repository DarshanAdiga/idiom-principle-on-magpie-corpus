With no ice time available during the NHL’s four-month pandemic-forced break, Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Tristan Jarry had little choice but to let his game go to the dogs.
 Diesel and Kitty, his two English mastiffs, to be specific.
 “That was something I did almost every day, take the dogs downstairs and play street hockey with them,” Jarry said.
 “We didn’t really have anyone to shoot on us over the break and I was just playing catch with my girlfriend at home and playing with the dogs. ... That was all we could mimic” he added. “I usually would just stick-handle around, and they would chase me around and try to grab the ball.”

Sheffield United ran out of steam in its charge for European qualification in losing to Everton 1-0 on a header from Richarlison in the English Premier League on Monday.
 Sheffield surprised many by not just comfortably avoiding relegation but challenging teams with much bigger financial resources in the fight for European places.
 Now Sheffield’s hopes hang by a thread after the defeat at Everton. Sheffield is eighth and would need results elsewhere to go its way to have any chance of reaching the Europa League.
 Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed against the post just before halftime for Everton, and his team then scored in the opening minute of the second half.

Joe Lee Doss was born on May 26, 1924 to William Joseph "Jodie" Doss and Fannie Lou Whitt Doss in Chickasaw County, MS. As a young teen, he lost his mother and found himself largely responsible for the care of his four younger siblings in the midst of abject poverty. He took his role very seriously as their protector and guardian, and even until his last night at home he would wake multiple times in the night to make sure his wife, "Nette," was properly covered and warm. At the age of 18, he was drafted into the United States Army where he fought on foreign soil for three tours in the armored infantry. During this time he suffered with frostbite and oftentimes lack of basic necessities, which led to a lifetime of pain from nerve damage, a broken heart from losing friends and comrades and, consequently, his boyish innocence. In 1947 he married his beloved "Nette" and in 1949 their first child was born. Just six months later they moved to Wisconsin and served in the Korean Conflict by training incoming soldiers for the next three years. He always felt this was even more dangerous than the time he spent on the front, because so many of the incoming men didn't even know how to hold a gun. During this period, Joe Lee, Jeanette, and Sandra lived together in a house with his brother Theo, his wife Bonnie, and their daughter Jeanie. They made memories together that would never be forgotten. After his honorable discharge in 1953, he was very resourceful, even during hard financial times, often working 2 or 3 jobs at a time in order to provide for his family. From working on a dairy farm to driving a milk truck, to working at a cheese plant, to being employed by Babcock and Wilcox for 26 1/2 years and working in law enforcement for over 5 decades, he always found a way to make ends meet. He even managed to have a little candy in his pocket for his kids to "find" on Fridays. He was a hard worker and a man of honor. He was a member of the Scottish Rite and took his vows seriously. He volunteered for more than thirty years at the Sparta Opera House, cooking, cleaning, and everything in between to help raise money for families in need. He served as a deacon at Bethel Baptist Church since 1965, served on the cemetery committee and was Sunday School Director for years. Rarely was there a Sunday he was not in attendance until his health declined and he was no longer able. All of these things tell you about his life. But the character of a man-that is what is most important. He was as stubborn as a mule and as strong as an ox. God, Family, Country. In that order. Always. He did not give his life for his country but he would have. Gladly. He risked his life saving others. He did not die for his country but he lived his life serving and sacrificing for his country and for all of those that he loved. He was a pillar of his community and both our anchor and compass and he bore others' burdens as his own. His memory will be cherished and he will forever be missed. He is survived by his beloved wife, Jeanette Harrington Doss, his four children, Sandra Doss Bullock (Edgar), Betty Lynn Doss Campbell (Edwon), Joe Douglas Doss, and Scott Harrington Doss (Cheryl). Nine grandchildren, Emily Nicole Beyer (Christopher), Jennifer Bullock, Edwon Bradley Campbell (Kimberly), Richard Cory Campbell (Jacqueline), Kevin Jordan Campbell (Allanda), Jonathan Doss Campbell (Yan), Stephen Andrew Campbell (Abby), Alyssa Layne Wright, and Kristy Doss Hardin (Brandon). Fifteen great- grandchildren, Olivia Beyer, Anderson Beyer, Sulmi Perdomo, Jordan Campbell, Peyton Campbell, Eli Campbell, Hannah Campbell, Kallan Campbell, Canon Campbell, Mei Lynn Campbell, Kayli Campbell, Norah Hardin, Grady Hardin, Aubrey Hardin, and Ezekiel Hardin. His brother, Roger Doss (Carolyn) and many, many nieces, nephews, and cousins. He was preceded in death by his mother and father, Jodie and Fannie Lou, his siblings Theo Doss, Cleo Doss, James Davis Doss, Jean Doss Murphree Alford, Barney Doss, and his granddaughter, Amanda Doss Harmon. A Private Family Graveside Service will be held for family only due to COVID-19.

Rahm surely has all the shots, a remarkable talent who doesn’t back down. He also is maturing, not just with his game but his emotions. Rahm has developed a reputation as a hothead — clubs buried into the turf, histrionics after poor shots — that will be difficult to shake. He has tried to tone it down without losing the positive energy that comes with it, and the weekend at Muirfield Village was ripe for anyone to lose it.
 He won it with great discipline on the front nine, with that Spanish magic on the back nine. He built a big enough lead that a two-shot penalty assessed after the round — his ball moved ever so slightly when he put the wedge behind it before chipping in behind the 16th green — turned a five-shot victory into a three-shot victory. Rahm didn’t see the ball move until shown a close-up on a video screen. He accepted the penalty.
 “I wish I could just keep that birdie because it was one of the greatest shots of my life, right?” he said.
 So one of his greatest shots turned out to be a bogey. He can live that.

A commission to propose a new state flag design will meet for the first time Wednesday morning, though Gov. Tate Reeves has not yet named the appointments to the commission he is required by law to make.
 Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Speaker of the House Philip Gunn have jointly called for a 10 a.m. Wednesday meeting of the commission that will select a new flag design to go before voters in November.
 The commission’s membership includes Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill.
 Under a state law that retired the state’s former flag and initiated the process to replace it, Hosemann, Gunn and Reeves must each make three appointments to the commission. The commission will select any design of its choosing as its recommendation provided that the new design does not include the Confederate battle emblem and does include the words, “In God We Trust.”
 Voters will either accept or reject the proposed new design on November’s ballot, with no option provided to retain the former state flag, which was the last state flag in the country to incorporate the Confederate battle flag.
 By state law, appointments to the commission were to be made by July 15. Hosemann and Gunn each announced their three selections by the deadline. Almost a week now since that deadline elapsed, Reeves has yet to publicly named any of his three appointments.
 Of his three appointments, one must be a representative of the Mississippi Economic Council, one a representative of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History and one a representative of the Mississippi Arts Commission.
 Gunn and Hosemann faced no restrictions as to their selections to sit on the commission.
 A spokesperson for Reeves said the governor has been preoccupied with the ongoing threat of COVID-19, which continues to widen its spread in the state.
 “Governor Reeves’ top priority right now is ensuring the health and well-being of all Mississippians during this unprecedented pandemic, working around the clock with our state health experts to limit transmission. The Governor will announce his appointees once he’s had the opportunity to review the limited options from which he’s able to choose,” said Renae Eze.
 The six named members thus far are as follows:
 • Reuben Anderson, former state Supreme Court justice
 • Sherri Carr Bevis, former secretary of state staffer, and educator
 • Mary Graham, president of Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College
 • Robyn Tannehill, Oxford mayor
 • TJ Taylor, policy director for Gunn
 • J. Mack Varner, attorney
 The legislation that retired the former state flag required Gunn and Hosemann to jointly call the first meeting of the commission that propose a new design. The commission will then elect a chairman. After the first meeting, the commission will have broad discretion to hold additional meetings or invite public comment.
 The commission must propose a new flag design by Sept. 14. If voters in November reject the proposed design, the commission will go back to work selecting a new design for another referendum vote.

 NEW DELHI, July 21 (Reuters) - India and the United States are closing in on a trade deal, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday, after two years of negotiations.
 India is seeking concessions for generic drugs it exports to the United States in return for opening its dairy markets and slashing tariffs on farm goods as the two sides seek to clinch a new trade accord, three sources told Reuters.
 They have been negotiating a limited trade pact aimed also at restoring zero tariffs on a range of Indian exports to the United States under its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), from which the Trump administration withdrew last year, citing lack of reciprocal access to Indian markets.
 "In the long term, I believe we have a quick trade deal which has some of the pending matters built up over the last couple of years, which we need to get out of the way quickly. We are almost there," Goyal said at the U.S.-India Business Council's India Ideas Summit, being conducted virtually.
 Goyal further said New Delhi and Washington should look at a preferential trade pact with 50 to 100 products and services before moving to a free trade pact.
 "We believe we should also look at an early harvest in the form of a preferential trade agreement rather than waiting for the gains of a free trade agreement, which can take several years to conclude," he said. (Reporting by Neha Arora and Aftab Ahmed; Editing by Mark Heinrich)

Adds Sudan's comment, background)
 ADDIS ABABA, July 21 (Reuters) - Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan have agreed to resume talks to break a deadlock on the Grand Renaissance Dam reservoir on the Blue Nile, the leaders of the three countries said on Tuesday.
 The announcements made separately by Ethiopian leader Abiy Ahmed, Sudan's Abdalla Hamdok and Egypt's presidency, followed a virtual mini-African Union summit that was called after they failed to reach an agreement earlier this month.
 "The extraordinary meeting... concluded with all parties reaching a major common understanding which paves the way for a breakthrough agreement," Abiy's office said in a statement which was posted on Twitter.
 South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, who chaired Tuesday's online meeting of the AU, confirmed there would be further negotiations.
 "The trilateral negotiations remain on track," Ramaphosa wrote on Twitter.
 Sudan and Egypt both fear the $4 billion hydroelectric dam could lead to water shortages in their own countries.
 The project has raised concerns in Egypt that already limited Nile waters will be further restricted. The Blue Nile is a tributary of the Nile from which Egypt gets 90% of its fresh water.
 "It was agreed, at the conclusion of the summit, to continue negotiations and focus for the time being on giving priority to developing a binding legal agreement on the rules for filling and operating the Renaissance Dam," a statement issued by the Egyptian presidency said.
 Ethiopia, which says it needs the dam to generate electricity for its people, has already achieved the first year of filling its dam due to the rainfall season in the area, the statement from Abiy's office said.
 "The dam under construction is already overtopping," it said, adding that Ethiopia was committed to a "balanced and win-win" negotiation that ascertains that the river will benefit all the three countries involved.

"When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up. You have to say something; you have to do something." -- Rep. John Lewis
   
 What exactly do you say about a man who dedicated his entire life to serving others? How do you compose the words to describe someone who was truly larger than life? The truth is, there are no words that can truly capture everything that John Lewis embodied and what he meant to the civil rights movement and to Black people in this country. His passing leaves extremely big shoes behind that may never be filled.
   
 However, we can all strive to be exceptional human beings, as he was.
   
 I met Congressman Lewis on several occasions. At the Democratic National Convention in 2008, I was seated next to him while we waited for the keynote speaker. It was clear to me that John loved all people. I had the time of my life as we engaged in a four-hour conversation that would ultimately reshape my political career and my commitment to serve.
   
 At that time, I had served for 10 years in the Georgia House of Representatives and had just been elected to the state Senate. I was thinking about retiring, but as John and I talked, his emphasis on public service and the need for more leaders to change social justice had a great influence on me. I recommitted myself to public service, believing as John did that change can happen nonviolently, with respect for each other.
   
 John Lewis' extraordinary life began in 1940 when he was born to sharecroppers. He first met Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the age of 18 and gave himself wholeheartedly to the pursuit of racial justice. Everything he worked for was undergirded by the principles of peace, love and nonviolence, although he was arrested more than 40 times for his activism. We must heed John's call when he said, "Now we have black and white elected officials working together. We have gone beyond just passing laws. Now we have to create a sense that we are one community, one family. Really, we are the American family."
   
 John Lewis was my hero. He was a giant among men who fiercely dedicated his life to fighting for equality and justice for all. He fought this fight - with nonviolence and love for all - until the very end, and our nation is a better place because of him. We should all be thankful that we were able to witness his extraordinary and selfless leadership during our lifetime. A man of strong Christian convictions who once considered being a minister, John is now home. So now we say to you Congressman John Lewis, "Well done thy good and faithful servant." Continue to walk with the wind at your back.
   
 To honor this wonderful man and to keep his legacy alive, fighting injustice, we should all do as Congressman Lewis would do and "Get into some good trouble!"

We’ve also discussed that at length with our testing vendor to make sure we are not having a negative impact on any of their business.”
