Now, let’s talk numbers. Since its founding, Thread International has diverted more than 96 million plastic bottles that would have otherwise ended up in landfills and oceans. This number seems incredible, enormous, life-changing — and it is. However, when we compare this number to how much plastic we use every day and every year, it’s obvious that we still have a long way to go to save our planet. For example, in the U.S., each day, more than 60 million plastic water bottles are thrown away; and each year, 8 million metric tons of plastic wind up in our oceans (and that’s enough trash to cover every foot of coastline around the world with five full trash bags of plastic —compounding every year). Hopefully, with sustainable start-ups like Thread International, fashion companies and entrepreneurs everywhere will latch onto the trend when they realize that creating a successful, sustainable and humanitarian business is a more than viable option.

KALISPELL, Mont. (AP) — Back in March, actor and singer Dustin Brayley was on stage performing the first of four concerts in Florida with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, a touring rock band, when officials suddenly canceled the remainder of their shows due to the novel coronavirus that was spreading around the world. As nationwide lockdowns began, Brayley immediately booked a flight home to Los Angeles, fearing he might get stuck in Florida. After 17 chaotic hours in mask-less airports among panic-stricken travelers, Brayley was back home in L.A. with his wife, actress and Broadway veteran Meredith Patterson, and their 5- and 8-year-old sons. With nearly all of their jobs canceled for the foreseeable future as the pandemic raged on, they hunkered down in California. But not everything was canceled. In July, Brayley, Patterson and their kids road-tripped to Whitefish to help coach Alpine Theatre Project’s (ATP) Broadway Summer Training Camp, which they’ve done for the last few years. During the trip, their two sons cried and begged their parents to move the family to Whitefish. In four weeks, they were completely moved out of their home in L.A. “We said, ‘Screw it,’” Brayley told the Flathead Beacon. “There’s nothing keeping us here; all of our jobs are gone. We could either have the mentality of ‘let’s just ride this out’ or ‘let’s just make this our home base.’” Brayley and Patterson are not the only talented transplants who have moved to the Flathead since the pandemic began. In the last few months, ATP co-founder Luke Walrath says a handful of professional artists and former Broadway actors he’s worked with have permanently relocated to the area. Since Walrath and his wife, Betsi Morrison, founded ATP in 2004, they have consistently hired professional Broadway stars for the...

The Gurnee native voiced Twitter support for Iowa State assistant Nathan Scheelhaase, a fellow former Illini as well as an Illinois assistant during part of Reams’ career, as the next Illini boss. “Illinois needs someone who loves Illinois as much as Josh Whitman does. Someone who will truly bleed blue and orange,” Reams told The News-Gazette. “With that said, I can’t stop thinking of Nate Scheelhaase or someone like him. Someone who was a great player, is a great coach and is a great person.”

So how exactly does this spinning plastic bottles into fabric magic happen? In a nutshell, here’s how the Thread model works: Haitians gather up discarded plastic bottles and deliver them to nearby recycling centers. From there, the bottles are washed and ground into a plastic flake, which can be transported more easily. The resulting flake product is then loaded up and shipped to textile processing facilities in the U.S. or China, where it can be broken down and spun into thread, yarn and fabric. The resulting fabric is either 100% polyester or a blended mix of fibers. The overarching goal is to create high-quality fabric that is manufactured in an environmentally responsible way (with minimal water and energy use).

Those who grew up and thrived on the “Super Mario” franchise know its basic plot. The main character Mario journeys through the Mushroom Kingdom or across lands and worlds to save the kidnapped Princess Peach from evil King Bowser. All the “Super Mario” games tell a reiteration of the same story with the same trope to accompany it. Take “Super Mario Galaxy,” released in 2007, 22 years after the first official game release. However, one simple change was made — not in the story, but where the story unfolds. Instead of traveling around the Mushroom Kingdom to save the Princess, the player controlling Mario journeys across the universe instead.

Between education campaigns, pregnancy mentors and case managers, probation officers, human assistance specialists, new programming and more, the county estimates it has invested nearly $40 million into the effort thus far.
 The county saw the three-year rolling average rate of infant sleep-related deaths drop 51% by 2018. Over the same period, child deaths due to abuse and neglect declined dramatically, down 88%.
 "This is one of those initiatives that this county can be extremely proud of," Board Chair Phil Serna said last week. "It's years in the making, we're seeing the outcomes that we had hoped for and then some."
 The campaign was borne out of a blue-ribbon commission that Serna commissioned in 2011 that focused on disparities in deaths among Black children.
 That commission found that over a 20-year period, Black children made up 12% of the child population, but accounted for 25 percent of all perinatal deaths, 32 percent of all infant sleep-related deaths, 30 percent of child abuse and neglect homicides and 32 percent of all third-party homicides in Sacramento County.
 "It's very rewarding, I can tell you, to sit here nine years later and reflect on where we were and where we've come," Serna said.
 There is more work to be done, campaign leaders said. Infant perinatal death rates have not changed much as of 2018, the most recent data available. The coronavirus pandemic, which has forced children and teens into months of isolation without access to in-person school or afterschool programs, has led to an increase in gun violence and homicides this year that threatens gains made by the campaign.
 But leaders with the campaign are confident the campaign has created a foundational network to bend those trends in a positive direction. It's been a "proven health equity and racial justice strategy," Greater Sacramento Urban League president and CEO Cassandra Jennings told supervisors last week.
 Last month, Sacramento County declared racism a public health crisis, in a resolution acknowledging the county should have a more active role -- when making policy and funding programs -- in rectifying longstanding issues around race.
 Efforts like the Black Child Legacy Campaign not only helped illuminate the ways poverty and racist policies have left thousands of families and young people behind, but also addressed the legacy of racism in public health head- on. To sustain results thus far, and make good on the promise of that resolution, leaders of the campaign urged the supervisors to continue funding programs such as Black Child Legacy in next year's budget and beyond.
 "Now the board of supervisors are caught with a moral question: Are you going to continue to fund this work?" Montgomery-Block said. She concluded her presentation to the board by asking, "Can you imagine come June 30 and Black Child Legacy Campaign is no longer?"
 "I can't," she continued. "And neither can these neighborhoods that really need it the most."

But other coaches were required to shift up in the pecking order, as well. Chief among them is Jimmy Lindsey, who has been bumped up from defensive ends coach to defensive coordinator for Saturday’s game at Beaver Stadium.
 Lindsey, like Rod Smith, said he hasn’t been in such a situation before as a coach. Lindsey has been at Illinois 11 months after joining the staff on Jan. 17 after stints at Chattanooga, Gardner-Webb, Miami (Ohio), Tennessee-Martin, Furman, Georgia Southern and Western Kentucky. The 43-year-old Lindsey coached the last three seasons at Western Kentucky before arriving at Illinois.
 “We got together as a defensive staff and conglomerated on some things,” Lindsey said. “There’s not a lot you can change in four days. ... And at the end of the day, the thing is just making it fun for the (players) and getting those guys to play with great effort.”
 Senior defensive end Owen Carney Jr. said he’s excited for Lindsey to receive this opportunity on the sideline.
 “If I was a fan of the Illini, I would definitely tune in,” Carney said. “The main part, it’s a different voice, a different leader, a different person at head when it comes to the defense. I’m ready to play for him.”
 ## Something to play for
 Even though bowl game qualifications have gone by the wayside this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Saturday’s game likely is the last game this season for the 2-5 Illini.
 Rod Smith said he hopes the chance to compete at the Big Ten level one more time in 2020 is motivation enough for athletes who might be feeling down after Lovie Smith’s firing.

Though states have spent millions more this fall as COVID-19 cases surged again, the initial PPE spending panic has subsided as production increased and supply chains improved.
 California spent the most during the pandemic's initial months -- at least $1.5 billion in the AP's data -- followed by Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington. New York also spent several hundred million dollars on PPE and ventilators through November, though it's unclear how much of that occurred in the spring.
 New Jersey and New York provided total figures but not specific details about their purchases. New Jersey's health department said it would be too "disruptive" to agency operations to do so, and New York repeatedly postponed a response.
 The AP's data shows that millions of dollars flowed from states to businesses that had never before sold PPE, including a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, an American tribal organization and consultants with international connections. Traditional safety equipment suppliers also saw a surge in PPE sales, offsetting their losses from other products amid the sudden recession.
 But the states' burst of spending wasn't a boon for everyone. Some businesses that tried to supply PPE lost millions of dollars when states canceled orders that failed to meet aggressive delivery deadlines or strict product specifications. Businesses selling PPE faced a treacherous market, with backlogs at foreign manufacturers, shipping delays and multiple intermediaries.
 All of that led to a spike in prices paid by the states, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
 Before the pandemic, an N95 mask that filters out tiny particles might have cost about 50 cents. This spring, states paid an average of $3 each, according to the AP's analysis. Some states paid more than $10 a mask to get them quickly. Average prices for gloves rose fourfold.
 In mid-March, Louisiana paid $57,450 for 5,000 N95 masks -- at $11.49 each -- from Grey Wolf Safety Group in Broussard. Grey Wolf owner Sean McClellan said that to fulfill the state's order, he had to buy out whatever his competitors had in stock. Some masks he got were designed for painting, others for welding. Some came with special breathing valves, while others did not.
 "All the cheap masks that were N95, those were already gone," McClellan said. "So I basically bought up the expensive ones that were left."
 Then he marked up the price a bit more and resold them to the state, making a couple of dollars per mask.
 "I'm not price-gouging," McClellan said. "I have to make something, and I then have to pay my salesperson something."
 Other businesses that charged high prices to states offered similar explanations. Go Green Solutions Inc. in South Grafton, Massachusetts, sold its home state several thousand N95 masks in early April for $11.25 to $11.50 each. The price was a product of limited supply and high demand, resulting in only modest profit margins, manager Jim Fisher said.
 "Usually, if you found inventory with some of your suppliers, you had to make a purchase right then and there. You couldn't wait," he said, "because within an hour, it would be gone."
 States competed with each other, hospital systems, the federal government and even other countries to find and buy medical gear as the virus began spreading.
 The pressure to obtain protective supplies led some states to unusual sources. Minnesota bought 2,300 waterproof gowns intended for milking cows from Udder Tech Inc. The special gowns cost about $46 each when freight was included -- about seven times the average price that states were paying for medical gowns this spring. Before the pandemic, some health care systems could buy disposable gowns for about 40 cents each.
 "They were looking to acquire anything they could at that point to help protect the health care workers," said Dana Casto, business manager at the Rosemount, Minnesota-based dairy supply company.
 While some states paid a premium for small orders from local suppliers, their purchasing agents also scrambled to secure large quantities of protective equipment, much of it manufactured in Asia. That created an opportunity for companies to enter the PPE field.
 The largest supplier of PPE to states this spring had never sold a single mask before the pandemic. But from mid-March to early June, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD sold $930 million worth of masks and sanitizer to states. Two-thirds of that went to California, where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom drew criticism for initially keeping secret the details of his "bold and big" deal that paid BYD $3.30 for each N95.
 Like the leaders of some other states, Newsom sidestepped the traditional purchasing process of publicly soliciting competitive bids from vendors, which can take weeks or even months. Some state lawmakers responsible for budgeting complained that Newsom left them out of the loop.
 Washington, which was among the first states to record coronavirus cases, bought tens of millions of N95 masks and similar KN95 masks from BYD this spring at prices ranging from $2.58 to $4.02 each. That helped rank Washington among the top states in mask purchasing rates per COVID-19 cases among its residents, according to the AP's analysis.
 BYD also sold to Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas this spring and signed an additional $316 million deal with California in July, after the period covered by the AP's data. By then, the price the company charged to California had fallen to $2.13 per N95 mask and 20 cents per surgical mask, barely a third of the spring rate.
 During the first quarter of 2020, when China was in lockdown, BYD reported a 35% decline in operating income. That's when company Chairman Wang Chuanfu decided to begin making masks and sanitizer. BYD's income rebounded to post a 12% gain through the first three-quarters of the year. Its stock price surged from $5 a share in January to more than $20 this fall, although it's unclear how much of that is attributable to new PPE production versus its sales of electric vehicles and other products.
 Frank Girardot, senior communications director for BYD North America, compared Chuanfu to an inventor "along the lines of Thomas Edison" who got into the PPE business for altruistic reasons.
 "He, in January, decided that this was something that the company had to do in service to the world," Girardot said.
 BYD's largest U.S. investor is Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett.
 Fastenal Co. and W.W. Grainger, two industrial suppliers, also saw surges in PPE sales. The AP's data includes $99 million in PPE sales to 32 states by Fastenal, and $50 million in PPE sales to 40 states by Grainger, which said its profits on those sales were squeezed by increased freight costs and previous contracts with reduced prices.
 Many of the companies in the AP's data set are not publicly traded and thus can keep their financial figures private. For example, one of the largest deals is California's $179 million order of 20 million gowns from BuKo LLC. The New York-based company has a bare-bones website that describes it as "a brand and product development think tank." Few other details are available about the company.
 BuKo owner Rashmi Budhram declined to comment when reached by telephone.
 Others, however, were more than willing to describe how PPE sales provided a lifeline at the onset of the pandemic.
 The leaders at Grand Traverse Economic Development, a commercial investment entity for the Ottawa and Chippewa Native American tribes in Michigan, decided to get into the PPE business when a shutdown affected the tribe's other business ventures. The organization quickly became New Hampshire's top PPE supplier, selling the state nearly $28 million worth of masks, gowns, coveralls, face shields and sanitizing wipes this spring. It made a profit of around 10% to 15%, business development director Lauren Tucker said.
 "This helped us keep our doors open, keep our staff fully employed and engaged, and we grew during the pandemic," she said.
 Bellia, president of Body Armor Outlet, also expanded. The AP's data for the spring includes just over $50 million in PPE sales to states by the Salem, New Hampshire, company. But Bellia said his total PPE sales this year are around $120 million -- a roughly thirtyfold increase over his company's total sales for 2019.
 Because of the success, Bellia increased his payroll from eight to 12 employees. And while he continues to sell body armor, he cleared almost all of it out of his warehouse to make room for coronavirus PPE.
 "While in a heartbeat I would trade this to go back to the way it was, I think unequivocally it's been a great thing for us," he said.
