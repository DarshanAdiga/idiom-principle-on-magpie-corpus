The Assam unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday expressed resentment and reservations on certain policy changes by the state government on management of Covid-19 pandemic in the state.In a letter addressed to health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (copy of which is with HT), the IMA unit said with present surge in Covid-19 cases in the state it will be difficult to control the situation in the absence of proper planning. "Increasing hospital beds without manpower planning will be futile exercise as we have very limited resources in terms of doctors and health workers," the IMA's letter said.Till Monday, Assam had recorded 12,522 Covid-19 positive cases. The state's biggest city, Guwahati, and rest of Kamrup Metro district have been placed under total shutdown for 14 days beginning June 28 due to community spread of the disease."On Monday, the government issued a fresh set of guidelines increasing Covid duty for doctors from existing 7 days at a stretch to 11 days followed by 3 days in quarantine and resumption of duty after their tests come negative," said Dr. Satyajit Borah, IMA Assam unit president."This was done without consultation with stakeholders. Working in Covid centres for 11-days at a stretch wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits in this summer without air-conditioning in most centres is very exerting and will demoralize frontline workers," he added.The IMA unit also opposed the government's decision to switch over from RT-PCR tests to rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for checking health workers engaged in COVID. It added that according to ICMR, the RAD test "is less sensitive and negative result does not rule out Covid"."Already a number of doctors and healthcare workers have fallen victim to Covid and such unplanned and insensitive steps will further endanger the health workers. IMA demands a critical review on why so many doctors and health workers are affected by the disease," the letter stated.Though exact figures of Covid-19 infection among doctors and health workers wasn't available, IMA office bearers mentioned nearly 20-25 doctors have tested positive for the virus in the state."IMA urges the government to take experienced healthcare professionals and groups in confidence in proper planning to face the challenges rather than taking closed door and whimsical decisions. Otherwise the much talked about successful Assam model will collapse in no time," the letter cautioned.The IMA unit advised the state government to adhere to ICMR's advice of management of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in their homes in order to lessen burden on healthcare workers and facilities.Reacting to the IMA letter, principal secretary (health and family welfare) Samir Kumar Sinha mentioned that he was aware of the issues raised and they will be sorted out after consultations."We had to raise the number of Covid duty days from 7 to 11 for healthcare workers due to the surge in cases. We have to provide medical services to the patients or else there will be more deaths," Sinha said."Unlike RT-PCR test, which used to take several days to get results, the RAD test allows us to get results within an hour. Once the results come negative and their quarantine period is over, healthcare workers can get back to duty," he added.Health department officials requesting anonymity said keeping asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in home quarantine is tough for Assam as healthcare workers will need to pay visits regularly to monitor them. But a change in protocol is expected within the next few days.

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (WPBF/Hearst/CNN) - Police said a shooting that left three people dead, including a teenage girl, started with a court dispute over a dog.It’s not clear yet if the suspect took his own life or was killed by police gunfire.“If you heard this call come over the radio, it would make the hair on your neck stand up -- a little girl calls in saying ‘there’s someone shooting in our house, I think my parents are dead, I think my family is dead,’” St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascera said.Port St. Lucie Police say the suspect and the victims were neighbors who were having a dispute about a dog that was deemed dangerous in court earlier Monday.“They all came home from court, and then the suspect armed himself and went to the victim’s house,” Mascera said.Port St. Lucie Police said when they responded to the scene around noon, they found an adult man dead and a 13-year-old girl critically injured. She died at the hospital.“The officers and deputies encountered the suspect who was inside the victim’s residence. They exchanged gunfire with the suspect. One of our officers was injured,” Assistant Chief Richard Del Toro sad.The officer who was shot is expected to be OK.The suspect then retreated inside the victim’s house, leading to a two-hour standoff. Police said at least two others were able to escape the house but were taken to the hospital.When SWAT arrived, they entered the home and found the suspect dead. It’s unclear how the suspect died.“It’s just shocking and it’s just tragic,” Del Toro said. “It’s not characteristic for this neighborhood or the city but we are going to do everything we can to find out all the reasons why.”A neighbor who said he heard gunshots thought they were fireworks because he never expected something like this to happen in their neighborhood.“Nothing like this has ever happened in the last 20 years. It’s a great neighborhood. Something as crazy as this happening over somebody getting emotional over a dog is unheard of,” Charles D’Agata said.Copyright 2020 WPBF, Hearst via CNN.

Though most would not know the difference between the Galwan Valley and the Hot Springs areas if shown on a map, the confidence with which the two sparring sides are making claims and counterclaims is quite remarkable. If we could rise above our partisan divide and look at the big picture, we would see not only the complexion of Sino- Indian relations having been completely altered, but also global political realities rapidly evolving in directions few would have envisioned a few months ago.

Established in 1923, the Lone Rock Airport, as it was called then, was designated in 1927 as an emergency airmail landing field because it was located halfway between Chicago and Minneapolis. At the time, what is now the Dane County Regional Airport was a cabbage patch and Royal Airport was just getting up and running in Monona at what is now South Towne.

The bid by the Trinamool Congress government to reopen eco- tourism centres run by the West Bengal Forest Development Corporation (WBFDC) in north Bengal has created fear among local people who feel that entry of tourists may spike Covid-19 cases in the region.Till Tuesday, 647 Covid-19 cases were reported in Darjeeling district. The adjoining Kalimpong district has recorded 56 cases while Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar have recorded 402 and 188 cases respectively.WBFDC runs 13 tourism centres in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. Though bookings for the centres in Darjeeling have not started yet, those in Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar have opened and tourists have started arriving, officials said.Cop succumbs to Covid-19 in West BengaIn Kalimpong district, the centres in Jhalong, Paren and Mongpong are operating. Local people are unhappy about this and some forest department officials said off the record that they apprehend law and order problems.Kartabya Pradhan, secretary of Samsing-Kumai Home Stay Owners Association, said "There is no screening system for tourists arriving at the WBFDC-run centres located in remote places. We have been repeatedly requesting the police, forest department and Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) to ensure that tourists are properly screened. Nobody has paid any heed."Reacting to the apprehensions among local people, B Shewa, general manager of WBFDC said, "We opened the eco tourism centres following government orders. The local economy is largely dependent on tourism and it has nosedived in three months. We understand and respect the sentiment of the local people. We have to make them understand that we are taking precautions."For Coronavirus Live Updates"Though the centres in Takdah, Lepchajagat, Lava, Loleygaon and Samsing in the hills are closed, the move to open the centres in Paren and Jhalong without consulting local people may lead to unrest," said Kishore Thapa, the north Bengal coordinator of All India Union for Forest People and Workers.M Lama, a resident of Jaldakah, said "Local people are so concerned that only one vehicle is allowed to ply every day to bring people from Siliguri. Under these circumstances, the arrival of tourists has not gone down well with local residents."A senior forest officer in Darjeeling, who didn't wish to be named said, "Home-stay facilities have not opened because of the fear among local people. Tourists may face opposition."Pradhan said, "We have decided not to open home-stay facilities till August. We have requested WBFDC to take into account the fear among residents."

“It will be a little bit different, with a changed menu and ordering process for instance, but we’re retaining all the Rockfish magic that customers have come to love.
 “Plymouth is opening first, it is a great big spaced-out restaurant overlooking the boats and water, it has loads of outdoor space, different entry and exit doors and so on, it’s the perfect place to reopen first. The marine aquarium next door to us are also opening, feels good to be back.”
 He added: “We were performing strongly before lockdown and on track for our best year yet. Lockdown has put incredible pressures on hospitality but we are confident and optimistic about the future.
 “We’ve been helped by our bank, by Government loans and we’ve used the time wisely to develop great ideas we’ve had on the back burner for a while and come out of this with a modern, fresh business. I believe we will emerge from this as one of the strongest restaurant businesses in the South West.
 “We’ve updated everything, in line with all the Government guidelines and have produced support documentation and training programmes for all staff, which start this week - it’s a big operation but it is also an exciting one, a chance to reboot.
 “Our mission has always been to change the way people experience seafood in the UK and we will continue with that. Prior to lockdown our focus was on further openings of our Rockfish restaurant group along the coast so plans to expand sites will be put on hold temporarily as we consolidate and deal with the new world.

The Supreme Court Tuesday extended till July 15 the protection granted to senior journalist Vinod Dua from any coercive action in a sedition case filed against him by a local BJP leader in Himachal Pradesh over his YouTube show and sought a report in a sealed cover on the probe conducted so far by the state police. An FIR against Dua under provisions of Indian Penal Code for offences of sedition, public nuisance, printing defamatory materials and public mischief was lodged by BJP leader Shyam at Kumarsain police station in Shimla district on May 6 and the journalist was asked to join the probe. Shyam has alleged that Dua, in his YouTube show, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using deaths and terror attacks to get votes. A bench of Justices U U Lalit, M M Shantanagoudar and Vineet Saran, which had granted protection from arrest to Dua in an unprecedented hearing conducted on a Sunday on June 14, asked the Himachal Pradesh police to file the report on the probe conducted so far in the case and said that it would now fix the case for final disposal. What about the records of the investigation. What all has been done till now File it in the registry in a sealed cover, the bench said, adding that the earlier order will continue till then. The bench also made clear that Dua, who has so far joined the police probe through virtual means, was not required to answer the supplementary questionnaire when his counsel and senior lawyer Vikas Singh alleged that the repeated questioning of the journalist amounted to harassment. On June 14, a Sunday, the top court had restrained the Himachal Pradesh police from arresting Dua till further orders. However, it had refused to stay the ongoing probe against him. It had asked Dua will have to join the investigation through video-conferencing or online mode as offered by him in his response to the summons issued by the police seeking his personal appearance. During the hearing, senior lawyer Vikas Singh said, I have the freedom of speech and expression and have the right to criticise the government. Police have refused to give us details on the nature of the complaint even though the Supreme Court has asked for a status report. He said Dua has already answered questions sent by the police and again another set of queries was sent and it would lead to harassment. Besides seeking quashing of the FIR, Dua, in the plea, has sought exemplary damages for harassment. He has also sought direction from the apex court that henceforth FIRs against persons belonging to the media with at least 10 years standing be not registered unless cleared by a committee to be constituted by every state government, the composition of which should comprise of the Chief Justice of the High Court or a Judge designated by him, the leader of the Opposition and the Home Minister of the State. Dua has said freedom of the press is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 191a of the Constitution. The plea said the top court has been emphasizing for distancing the police from the ruling party in the state but none of the major political parties which are in power in various states are ready to give up their control over the police. There is a recent trend against the media where state governments which do not find a particular telecast to be in sync with their political ideologies register FIRs against persons of the media primarily to harass them and to intimidate them so that they succumb to the line of the state or else face the music at the hands of the police, the plea claimed. Lodging of FIR and coercive steps against Dua amounted to direct and brazen violation of his fundamental rights, the plea said. The plea claimed there is a concerted approach of authorities to silence the media which is not palatable to them

Falling interest rates simply means that the segment of the population dependent on passive, fixed income—often senior citizens, will fall short of their required returns. This segment has the highest savings, with a lifetime of earnings behind them. At lower rates of returns, they are likely to turn away from investments that are yielding falling returns and move towards high yielding avenues. It also holds risks for the country’s banking system and the economy. Savings are important for capital formation.
