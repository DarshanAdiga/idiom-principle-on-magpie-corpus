A storm system is still poised to bring some chilly rain to the metro area on and off during the day Saturday into Easter Sunday. With falling temps and gusty winds expected Sunday, some of the rain has the potential to change over to snow during the PM hours. That locks in some cold April air to start off next week.

The last _Family_ gathering is about to take place. _Modern Family_, winner of five consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series Emmys, says goodbye with a two-hour event. At 8 p.m., ABC will unveil a one-hour documentary, _A Modern Farewell_, which takes you behind the scenes of the show's 11-season, 250-episode run. At 9 p.m., the two-part series finale involves new horizons and change -- plus, Phil and Claire ask one of their children to move out of the house to reduce the chaos. "We tried to balance the right level of comedy and emotion that our show has always done -- perhaps leaning with a slightly bigger dollop of emotion than usual, which seemed fitting here," co-creator Steve Levitan tells EW of the finale. "But we still wanted to tell funny stories and not get too maudlin about things. There's some nice comedy right to the end… We knew the audience was going to have to say goodbye to these characters, and we wanted them to have that cathartic experience." Your chance to release a few final laughs (and tears) awaits in a few hours. -- _Dan Snierson_

Dear Dave,   My husband runs a small business that has never done very well. We have three kids, and I make $55,000 annually in my job. Part of what I make has been going into the business for over a year to help keep it afloat, and we don't have a lot of money in savings. What do you think we should do?   Stephanie
 Dear Stephanie,   If you're putting other money into a business account, that's a pretty good sign you're not making money in the business. You and your husband need to sit down together and do a household budget and a profit and loss statement on the business. You've got to get on the same page financially.   Put all his business expenses on the profit and loss statement in detail, and write out what it would take for him to break even each month. But honestly, with everything that's been going on with your finances, if he's not at least breaking even at this point, then it's time for him to do something else for a living full-time.   I'm an entrepreneur and business owner. Trust me, I totally understand the allure and excitement that goes with running your own business. But your own household and its immediate financial responsibilities come first. The only money that should go into the business account is income the business creates.   Dave
 No free passes   Dear Dave,   I own a small business, and recently a relative asked for a job with the company. I hate to say this, but I've got reservations about hiring her. She's basically a good kid, but not the most reliable person in the world. Do you have any advice on how to handle a situation like this?   Bill
 Dear Bill,   As an entrepreneur, you have the right and responsibility to do what's best for your company. That means you shouldn't hire anyone who isn't a good fit - even a relative.   If a relative is qualified, and the kind of person who understands they'll have to bring it every single day, performing at a level equal to or above your other team members, that can be a special and rewarding thing. But if that relative is the kind of person who expects special treatment or is a problem child, that kind of situation can be a nightmare for you, your company and the whole family.   Would you hire this person because they'd make a good team member? Would you hire this person if they weren't part of the family? If the answer to either of these questions is no, don't hire them. It's as simple as that.   The bottom line is you have to do what's best for your business, your immediate family, and your team.   Dave

Lawyers are the silent protectors of our society. They leave no stone unturned to maintain equilibrium in the dynamics of the society and work relentlessly to further the cause of the truth. However, it is also important to understand that there are lawyers who do not take this noble profession seriously and only think of ways of fleecing their clients of their money. These lawyers only look for inappropriate ways to make more money, and in this process might also support criminals. Therefore, it is essential that we know how to separate the wheat from the chaff and rope in lawyers with integrity and pure intentions.

Claude Miller’s life turned when it just as easily could have ended at the age of 18.
 He was a passenger in a car crash in 1950 that took the life of one of his best friends.
 Claude was read his last rites.
 He survived. Claude never forgot how close he had come to death.
 “He felt a lot of his life was a bonus,” said his son, Pat. “He treated it that way.”
 Hundreds of baseball-playing youngsters in Janesville benefited from Claude Miller’s life, which ended Friday night when the 87-year-old died peacefully of natural causes at Cedar Crest assisted living.
 Miller dedicated 34 summers to coaching Janesville youth baseball. He started in 1962 and called it quits in 2005 at the age of 72 when Steve Nickols, whom he both coached and coached with, decided to leave the program.
 Claude loved coaching good players. But he loved coaching the not-so-good players just as much.
 He just loved being out there with his teams.
 “The thing I remember most is just how much fun he made it to be on the team,” his oldest son, Dan, said in 2013 when Claude was inducted into the Janesville Sports Hall of Fame. “He never discriminated against players; everybody would be equal.”
 “He viewed everyone in the most positive light,” Pat said. “He was happy for everyone’s successes. He was never jealous or resentful of other people’s successes.”
 That type of spirit resonated throughout the family, which included wife, Patty, sons Dan, Pat and Mike, and daughters Maureen and Megan.
 “The last cheeseburger he had was the best cheeseburger he ever ate,” was the family’s long-running joke.
 “Every group of 10-year-olds he had was the best group of 10-year-olds he had ever seen,” Pat said. “Each dog he got was the best dog he ever had.
 “Especially in this day and age, he was a refreshing person in that respect. He just saw the best in everyone and everything.”
 Terry Ryan, one of the best baseball players to come out of Janesville, did not play on a Miller-coached team. But Ryan’s father and Miller’s father were friends. Ryan has the utmost respect for Claude.
 “He was one of those good guys that contributed to Janesville,” said Ryan, who now is a special assignments scout for the Philadelphia Phillies.
 “Not only did he take a keen interest in his family, his kids, his boys especially, he was always affiliated with some kind of athletics down there.
 “He was always very good to me and my family, and my dad, especially.”
 Claude coached all three of his sons in Little League. While Pat promotes his father’s equal treatment of all his players, that did not always carry through to Dan, Pat and Mike.
 Pat recalls one time when he was influenced by an older player to go to Dunkin’ Donuts before a game. The donuts must have blocked the clock, because Pat arrived at the former boys baseball fields just before game time, way past the mandated 30 minutes before first pitch.
 “Needless to say, I did not play a second in that game,” Pat said. “But I don’t think I was ever late for anything again.”
 Claude also was not afraid to break new ground. He added Janesville Youth Baseball’s first black coach, Bill Taylor, as an assistant, and drafted Aaron Beck, JYB’s first black player.
 Those examples rubbed off on his family, especially Pat and Mike. Pat just completed his 19th season at UW-Whitewater, where he has 396 victories and was inducted into the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame this past September.
 Mike was the head boys varsity coach at Janesville Parker High for two years and at Janesville Craig for eight, in addition to coaching youth baseball.
 “I think throughout my career I’ve been more likely to give people opportunities and second chances,” Pat said of his dad’s influence. “A lot of that comes from him.
 “One of the things that stuck out to me was how much he enjoyed the players he coached and the people he coached with, and how much he followed them outside of baseball. There were countless times that he’d go watch one of his former players play football or basketball or some other sport.”
 Older coaches Floyd McNally and Roy Coyle especially were major influences for Claude. Coyle, a youth baseball coaching legend in Janesville, lived just down the street from the Millers.
 “I remember going to watch baseball games with those two,” Pat said of his father and Coyle. “The attention to detail and how analytical they were. He loved those guys, and (Steve) Nickols was the same way.
 “As much as he wanted to win, I think it was secondary to what his purpose was.”
 And the number of youngsters—now adults—who acquired parts of the long-time coach’s philosophy are better for it.
 “He was a true asset for the city of Janesville,” Ryan said.
 Janesville can be thankful Claude Miller survived that near-death crash as a youth.
 “He loved Janesville and the people and the kids,” Pat said. “The way he lived his life was refreshing.”

Messi recently offered a pointed dig at Bartomeu in the Spanish press, over claims made that Barca stars were unwilling to take a pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis.
 "It didn’t surprise us that inside the club there are some trying to put us under the microscope and pressure us into doing something that we were always clear we would do.”
 Bartomeu will leave the Barcelona presidency in 2021 and using Iniesta as a go-between from board to players would appear to be a last roll of the dice to appease the club's star names - notably the two most powerful men at the club, Messi and Bartomeu.

Bartomeu, 57, has now called on four directors to quit, after recent controversies which have led to strained relations.
 According to Sport, Bartomeu wants rid of ‘disloyal’ board members and, unable to sack them, has asked Emili Rosaud, Enrique Tombas, Silvio Elías and Josep Pont to resign.
 Amid claims that Bartomeu could look to bring Iniesta on board, the man who scored the winner in the 2010 World Cup Final told _Onda Cero:_ “I still want to continue playing football and maybe these days relaxing at home can prolong my career”.
 “I have a contract until 2021 and this year I am quite motivated with the desire to play on the football pitch again and feel those moments with the ball and the grass”.

Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi is auctioning items from his personal collection to raise money to support the NHS during the coronavirus crisis.
 Among the items up for grabs is one of Iommi's guitars, which will be signed by the rock legend.
 The money raised by the auction will go to University Hospitals Birmingham in Iommi's home city.
 The 72-year-old said coronavirus was "difficult for everyone" but showed the "great work" of the NHS.
 "It's horrible but in some ways it's bringing people together more and realising what we do have in this country with the NHS and the great things they do," Iommi said.

Arizona’s rise as one of the premier destinations for college coaches searching for next-level quarterbacks doesn’t come as a surprise to players or coaches.
 In fact, it’s been one of the main goals all along for two of the state’s premier private trainers, Dan Manucci and Mike Giovando. But with businesses shutting down and people staying inside due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, both trainers and the players have had to make several adjustments to maintain a safe atmosphere for all involved.
 “I wipe off my ball with Clorox wipes and use hand sanitizer on it and my hands,” said Christopher Arviso II, a freshman quarterback at Mountain Pointe. “Coach Gio helps me on a lot of stuff with my form and mechanics. I also would go to his classroom schedule. He teaches me everything I need to know to move up to 6A.”
