This scenario may seem farfetched, a species of conspiracy-mongering, but I wouldn't put it past the Democrats. They will stop at nothing, no matter how unethical, no matter how debauched and unscrupulous, no matter how much needless suffering is inflicted on the population, to ensure that a doddering and corrupt Joe Biden emerges from his basement the victor on November 3.

One of the apparent enigmas of our political moment is the behavior of countless governors and mayors who are allowing mass protests to erupt and persist in the midst of an infectious pandemic. Ordinary people everywhere are being compelled to wear masks; families, businesses, institutions and churches are in various stages of enforced lockdown; and social distancing is the order of the day. Yet thousands of protestors, demonstrators, vandals and rioters all across the nation are permitted to gather in close quarters, ostensibly on the grounds that the pursuit of (a fictitious) "social justice" and the fight against (an illusory) "systemic racism" outweigh every other consideration, including "flattening the curve" of viral casualties. On the face of it, such a phenomenon makes no sense at all.

It was reportedly not the first offense for Pebler, who has served in the office since 2002. In 2009, the release said, he was privately cautioned by the commission after he "engaged in unauthorized ex parte communications with each party and a nonparty, in a connection with a small claims matter."
 The commission found that Pebler’s prior caution “exacerbated” his misconduct, the release said.
 Pebler's current term expires on Dec. 31, 2021. He does not plan to seek re- election, a commission document said.
 Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian said, in the release, “The courts must be and appear fair and impartial. For a judge to disparage a defendant in public conversation, prior to the adjudication of the case, undermines public confidence in the administration of justice.”

Nothing could serve the Democratic left's action plan better. Deliberately cause a new outbreak of cases, generate a surge of new infections spreading throughout the country and a corresponding wave of fear, thus establishing a reason for a second lockdown, and Trump will have lost his megaphone. His rallies will fade into a distant memory. He will have been silenced in the very medium where he is most dynamic, vigorous and commanding.

It is to allow or not allow the route of Interstate Route 88 to pass through the park land.
 If the secretary gives the route the green light, another roadblock to the path of the expressway has been cleared.
 But, if Volpe refuses permission for I-88 to cross the park — and there have been indications that he is stern in his dealings with routes that infringe on park lands — then the Department of Transportation and the federal Bureau of Roads will have to reroute the $124 million expressway away from the park.
 Such a change would mean virtually redrawing every plan for the expressway and certainly put back construction up to an additional year. With the proposed start of construction recently pegged as not sooner than the spring of 1972, this could mean it would be late 1973 before the road could be started.
 And that, observers indicate, would certainly put the route in trouble with the deadline set for completion of this segment of the Interstate, a proposal that calls for the completion by June 30, 1974.

LEXINGTON — Beginning today and for a limited time, the American Red Cross is testing all blood, platelet and plasma donations for COVID-19 antibodies, providing donors insight into whether they have been exposed to this coronavirus. At the same time, there continues to be an urgent need for blood donations as hospitals resume surgeries and treatments that require blood products.
 Lexington High School will hold a scholarship blood drive on Monday, July 13 from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Parkview Baptist Church. Appointments are strongly encouraged to help promote responsible social distancing. To make an appointment, call or text Marcus at 746-6529 or visit redcrossblood.org and use sponsor code "lexingtonminutemen"
 Antibody testing will indicate if the donor’s immune system has produced antibodies to this coronavirus, regardless of whether they developed symptoms. Donations will be tested using samples pulled at the time of donation and sent to a testing laboratory where they will also undergo routine infectious disease testing. A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity.

George Floyd's death has sparked varied reactions. Some are horrified. Others are defensive of police action. But I saw it through the eyes of a mother. I saw a man who in his suffering, from what in his mind could only be perceived as hate, call out for his mother; a man who responded to hate with a call for love from the one person he knew loved him unconditionally.
   
 As mothers, we've heard the cries of our children when in pain. There's nothing more excruciating. There's nothing you wouldn't do to alleviate their pain. Move heaven and earth; sacrifice yourself if need be. Then I learned Floyd's mother had died and wondered if her child's cry could pierce the heavens to reach her heart. If it can, she'd do whatever she could to end his pain. She'd reach for him and lift him out of pain. I thought, it's possible because a mother's love transcends time and space.
   
 As a mother, Floyd's agonizing death has steeled my resolve to say to those politicians who remain silent or refuse to enact policies that hold law enforcement accountable, you're up against a mother's love and you will not win.
   
 Gail Miller, Poinciana

Roberts has struggled with numerous health issues ranging from cancer to double pneumonia. He discussed his current health and the operation he recently underwent.
 "I feel pretty good just getting over a surgery… on my hand and wrist. I had to have a couple of ligaments cut and my little finger remodeled. Then it was carpal tunnel and they snipped the ligament in my elbow also," revealed Roberts. "Fun and games – wear and tear."
 With AEW, Roberts is mentoring Lance Archer and he discussed the chemistry the two of them have developed over time.
 "He's a wonderful Christian man and he's a bull. He's got a lot of power. He reminds me of a young John Nord – The Berzerker – with the size and everything. He's a little wiser than John was and he's not a drinker or any of that," said Roberts. "So, we get along really well and we're about to go fishing in a couple of weeks so I'll really get to know him then [laughs].
 "I'm buying a boat this weekend. I'm buying one that I can put my grandkids on and take them sledding or tubing or whatever. I'm starting to enjoy my life a lot more; I really am. It's slowing down and I'm just taking a break."
 The last time Roberts joined our podcast, he discussed his longtime friend Joe Case who was battling cancer at the time. Case recently passed away and Roberts remembered his friend.
 "He was a friend for 50 years for me and the last friend that I had from high school. We've been through a lot together. We've built race cars together and traded cars. He built me a wrestling ring that wound up at the WWE. They took my plans and they copied that ring for the rest of their rings. Of course, they didn't pay us for it but that's okay and I don't give a damn," said Roberts.
 He added that Joe had a shop in Texas and would welcome people in to work on their cars. If Joe had a customer stranded 500 miles away, he wouldn't hesitate to drive 6-7 hours to reach them to help.
 "Some of us are here on this planet to give and he was a giver. Some of us our takers but he was always a giver and he gave to everybody," stated Roberts. "Every Christmas, he'd go down to the grocery store and get about 15 turkeys. He'd crank up the boiler he had and fryer and deep-fry turkeys for people that came by. 'Hey, take a turkey with you!' Just that kind of goofy guy.
 "The funniest thing about him was that he would cut his hair and shave once a year. That's it. It was like a spring-cleaning thing for him. Come June, he would cut all his hair off and shave his beard that he'd grow for another year. He was just that kind of guy."

While the study focused on in-game statements, Lee told FiveThirtyEight that it could certainly have included statements from studio segments. Take, for example, the comments from former Croatia manager and current West Bromwich Albion manager Slaven Bilić after Senegal beat Poland in the 2018 World Cup. After gesturing toward co-host Patrice Evra — who is Black, and who won five Premier League titles and a Champions League title with Manchester United and two Serie A titles with Juventus — Bilić said: “Senegal — which is not typical for African teams — they play for each other, and they deserved totally [to win]. They didn’t make any mistakes.”

In early June AEW announced that Fyter Fest would take place on _Dynamite_ on July 1st and 8th. Then in late June WWE countered by announcing that the Great American Bash would occur on those same dates on NXT.
 AEW's Jake "The Snake" Roberts discussed WWE countering AEW when he joined our The Wrestling Inc Daily podcast earlier today.
 "Well, they feel the heat. You know, competition is good for everybody. It makes people step up their game. Obviously, I'm gonna tell you who I'm going for – AEW and just because I want to. I think they have a good product. It's a different product and different is good, especially with where WWE is and different is good. At the end of the day, competition is good because it just makes people go out there and work harder and that's great for the fans. The fans reap the benefits of that," stated Roberts.

On Monday, as crews removed the base to finish the job, they made a startling discovery underneath the rubble: a time capsule.
 According to Michele Walker, a spokeswoman for the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, the capsule apparently was put there when the monument was erected in 1894.
 And its presence might have never been known.
 But Gov. Roy Cooper recently ordered the statue’s removal, along with the relocation of two other Confederate monuments on Capitol grounds in the wake of protests across North Carolina over racial equality for African Americans.
 The rusty capsule will be opened later this week in a lab.

Senior United States District Judge Thomas J. McAvoy also imposed a 15-year term of supervised release, to begin after Hobbie is released from prison, and restitution in the amount of $9,999.99. Hobbie will also be required to register as a sex offender upon his release from prison.
 After Hobbie's arrest, nearly 100 parents attended a meeting in the school auditorium discuss the situation with school and law enforcement officials.
 Several students who spoke to The Daily Star after the arrest said Hobbie had at times shown inappropriate behavior, including making overly personal comments or using excuses to touch them, such as saying he was fixing a tag on the back of their shirt or snapping a bra strap.
 Students who wished to remain anonymous also said Hobbie was known to watch girls changing in the locker room through the reflection on a trophy case.
 “A lot of girls are extremely uncomfortable with finding that out, the fact that people knew about it and acting like it was a thing that was just known, and feel very unsafe now,” said one junior girl.
 “Also a few students, he was way too touchy with," she said. "One student in particular would run up to him and jump into his arms, and wrap her legs around him, and it’s just completely inappropriate for a teacher-student relationship. A lot of students witnessed it, and it made everyone uncomfortable, and as a teacher he should not have let that happen.”
