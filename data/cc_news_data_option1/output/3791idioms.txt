Toxins produced by cyanobacteria in water holes killed about 330 elephants earlier this year in Botswana, the government has said. These mystery deaths in the Okavango delta between May and June had baffled scientists and conservationists. Close to 70% of the elephants were found dead near watering holes, and locals had observed the jumbos wandering in circles, seemingly dizzy, before dropping dead. The government tested soil and water as speculation about poisoning and poaching grew. Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms commonly found in water but not all produce toxins. Experts say toxic ones are becoming common due to global warming. Officials have now said they will be testing all waterholes for the algae blooms to prevent such mass deaths of elephants. They’re continuing the investigation into why only elephants, and not other animals, were affected by the toxins.

The passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has brought leftists to a full political tantrum. Facts, timing and the Constitution make it an increasingly likely prospect that President Trump will successfully install a third Supreme Court Justice in his first term. That drives liberals over the edge. Granted, it was not a very long drive, but in the last few days the left has let fly with an unprecedented political rave-out, even before Trump has revealed his nominee.
 Leftists have invoked Ginsburg's supposed dying wish that she not be replaced until a new president was in office. Former president Obama noted that RGB "left instructions for how she wanted her legacy to be honored," and that they should be obeyed. Of course such "instructions" are not binding, but it is another example of the cult-like adoration liberals had for the "Notorious RBG" which kept her on the bench long after more strategically-minded progressives were begging her to retire. Now the possibly contrived "wish" is all they have left.
 "Let this moment radicalize you," Demcoratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez said. No problem AOC, the rest of the party is right there with you. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted out a political hot take on RBG's passing even before he offered condolences and told his caucus that "nothing is off the table" for 2021 if Trump moves ahead. A frantic Schumer later claimed on the Senate floor that "by all rights, by every modicum of decency and honor, Leader McConnell and the Republican Senate majority have no right to fill [the seat], no right." The Constitution says otherwise. Schumer doesn't care.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi amped up the threats by suggesting the House could impeach Trump a second time to disrupt the process, since by Senate rules an impeachment trial must take precedence over other business. This cynical ploy would be even less legitimate than the first impeachment she concocted, but it shows the extent to which her hatred of Trump has consumed her. Whether the hurry-up impeachment could be sent to the Senate in time to sidetrack a confirmation vote is debatable, but the process would be so reckless, so dangerous, and such an affront to the Constitution that voters might decide that the country can no longer afford such militant, subversive control of the House.
 Leftists are so frustrated that they are embracing the hitherto fringe notion of forcing liberals onto the high court by expanding the number of seats. "If he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021," Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III tweeted. "It's that simple." Well maybe it is not that simple because first Democrats must take control of the White House and the Senate. Then there is the matter of a prospective Republican Senate minority gumming up the works with filibusters. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey's answer is to do away with the cloture rule altogether and effectively make the Senate into a smaller version of the House.
 The radicalism doesn't stop there; progressives see this fight as an opportunity to press for statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, adding four Democratic seats to the Senate.
 Bear in mind this is all before Trump has even announced a nominee. He has chosen to delay naming a successor until later in the week, after Ginsburg's funeral, as a gesture of respect. Old school liberal Chris Matthews tweeted that this was a rare act of "true presidential behavior." Matthews was then ripped with thousands of critical comments from enraged Leftists who have no interest in gestures or respect.
 No, for today's leftist this has nothing to do with Washington's political norms and courtesies. It is only about power. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin mocked Democrats as "weak and they're wimps and they're afraid," suggesting that court packing and other threats are hollow. He suggested Democrats take the fight to the streets, as though the country hasn't seen enough of that over the summer. But sure enough, chanting protesters have already descended on the homes of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
 This is only a preview of what we can expect once a nominee is announced and hearings commence. Remember the demonstrations against Neil Gorsuch in 2017, and the much worse scenes during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Recall the frantic protesters literally trying to claw their way into the Supreme Court during Justice Kavanaugh's swearing in. Coming off a season of rioting, looting and burning, radical Leftists will be primed for confrontations, and Democratic leaders will say or do nothing to deter them.
 Newt Gingrich summed it up best: "There will be sort of a frenzy because the truth is that they're powerless." If Republicans can muster 50 votes for a qualified nominee there is nothing Democrats can do to stop the process. Their nihilistic threats to tear down the system only show their true character and lack of commitment to Constitutional government. As if we didn't already know.

"There is an amazing amount of Black talent out there," said Ken Bacon, a former mortgage industry executive who is on the boards of Comcast Corp , Ally Financial Inc and Welltower Inc . "If people say they can't find the talent, they either aren't looking hard enough or don't want to find it."
 Bacon said he was "shocked and puzzled" by Scharf's comments.
 Wells Fargo spokeswoman Beth Richek defended Scharf’s record on diversity.
 The CEO of the largest U.S. bank employer has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals. He is also requiring hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant, and ensure diversity on interview teams.
 Wells Fargo's latest proxy disclosed more diversity data than those of many other companies, including that two of 12 directors at the time were Black and 1 was "Latino/Hispanic".
 Scharf "is committed to deep and systemic change to increase diversity and has held several forums where there has been candid conversation and unfiltered feedback," Richek said in a statement. Scharf was not available for an interview, she said.
 "TALENT IS THERE"
 Introspection across corporate America during the Black Lives Matter movement has cast a harsh light on the lack of diversity. In boardrooms, African- Americans made up 10per cent of new director appointments in the Fortune 500 last year compared with their 13per cent of the U.S. population, according to a 2020 report from executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles. New Hispanic directors were even more scarce, the study found.
 Only 7.3per cent of the five highest-paid executives at financial companies in the Russell 3000 were racial or ethnic minorities, according to data from ISS ESG, an arm of the proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. That number has risen in recent years, yet remains far below the percentage of minority groups in the general U.S. population.
 Senior corporate executives and recruiters said the notion of a shallow minority talent pool is frequently cited as a hurdle to improving diversity but probably reflects insular professional and social networks.
 Lauren Holland, who chairs a word-of-mouth professional network called Wall Street Friends, said she has 8,000 members in minority communities, and sent out more job posts to them in the last two months than in the last five years.
 "I literally get emails every single day from people asking to be added to our list," she said. "The talent is there. It's just a matter of the firm accessing it and connecting with it."
 NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS
 Experts said one reason board rooms and C-suites lack diversity is that such jobs are often filled by people who have managed businesses, while many people of color have tended to be stuck in roles that lack a direct connection to profits.
 "As women and minorities started to gain traction in corporate America, they were trapped in certain jobs companies felt comfortable placing them in, like human resources, administrative-support type functions," said Teri McClure, former general counsel and chief human resources officer at United Parcel Service Inc , who now sits on several boards, including JetBlue Airways Corp .
 McClure said she frequently heard comments like Scharf's when companies have not tried hard enough to find diverse candidates or give them the experience to qualify for senior roles.
 Some black directors and executives said they were not happy with the progress that had been made in improving diversity.
 "Unless I practically get on a soapbox about it and ask about it every meeting, it gets pushed out," said Mary Winston, a director at companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc , about some of her past work on boards. "It's just not as robust a conversation as it should be, and no progress has been made."
 Winston, adding that she is often the only person of color in board rooms, also disagreed with the notion of a talent shortage.
 One of the Wells Fargo employees said there simply was no lack of talent: "I can get them 10 to 15 resumes today."

LUFKIN, Texas (KTRE) - Lufkin ISD’s administration and faculty members have been reaching out to the parents who students who struggled during the first grading period, according to Lynn Torres, LISD’s superintendent.Their message, especially to the parents of students who are still doing virtual learning, has been, “Come back to school.”“We’ve been very diligent about looking at our failure rates, and we’ve been in contact with parents of students, especially those who are doing virtual learning, who haven’t been successful,” Torres told Good Morning East Texas anchor Erika Bazaldua Tuesday morning. “Our suggestion to them has been to come back to school.”Torres said Lufkin ISD had about 356 students return to their respective campuses for in-class instruction.“We’ve opened the window, and whenever they want to come back, they are welcome,” Torres said.The Lufkin ISD superintendent said they are now in Week 5 of their 2020-2021 school year.Next Monday will be the next window for parents of students to choose to go the virtual learning route, Torres said. However, she added they expect the number of virtual-learning students to go down again. Right now, about 22 percent of the school district’s students are doing distance learning from home.Torres said parents of some Lufkin ISD students are still choosing to have their children do the virtual learning because they have lingering health and safety concerns. She said some families are keeping their children out of school because one or more family members are in at-risk groups.Lufkin ISD is also getting ready for its first football game of the season. The Panthers will be playing the Tyler Legacy High School Red Raiders in Tyler Friday night. “We’re excited about getting back to a little more normalcy,” Torres said.Tickets for the Lufkin-Tyler Legacy matchup will go on sale on the Tyler ISD website at midnight on Wednesday. Torres said LISD parents need to be aware that because of the social distancing protocols, only a limited number of tickets will be available for Friday night’s game.Torres added Lufkin ISD is diligently looking for an opponent for the Panthers' first home game on Oct. 2. Nacogdoches ISD’s leadership canceled that game. She said they are looking at some potential opponents, other teams who have had cancelations. Recently, the Lufkin Panthers had a scrimmage at one of their practices, and Torres said parents did an excellent job of wearing their masks and social distancing when they showed up to watch that game.Click the video above to watch the full interview.Copyright 2020 KTRE.

It all started because Fox did NOT want to lose the film rights to Marvel’s First Family. Constantin Films’ option on the IP—obtained back in 1986 for the ludicrously low price of $250,000—had always been contingent on the production company putting out a new film _within a certain time frame_ , lest the rights revert back to Marvel Comics; the unreleased low-budget 1994 _Fantastic Four_ film had been produced _explicitly_ as a Hail Mary pass to hold onto those rights, even though the producers had never intended an audience to lay eyes on it. So Constantin and Fox were under pressure to keep a steady stream of Fantastic Four films in production, however they could—and following the dismal critical and box-office performance of 2007’s _Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer_ , they rushed to announce that the franchise would be getting a _reboot_ only a couple of years later.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Just days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won a court victory to keep felons from voting until they’ve paid off fines, restitution and court fees, billionaire Mike Bloomberg has stepped in to help them pay off the debts.The former Democratic presidential candidate has helped raise more than $20 million so that felons who completed their prison sentences can vote in the presidential election. Bloomberg also has pledged $100 million to help Joe Biden win Florida.“The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and no American should be denied that right. Working together with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, we are determined to end disenfranchisement and the discrimination that has always driven it,” Bloomberg said in a written statement.A federal appellate court ruled on Sept. 11 that in addition to serving their sentences, Florida felons must pay all fines, restitution and legal fees before they can regain their right to vote. The case could have broad implications for the November elections. Florida has 29 electoral college votes that are crucial to President Donald Trump’s hopes of staying in the White House.Under Amendment 4, which Florida voters passed overwhelmingly in 2018, felons who have completed their sentences would have voting rights restored. Republican lawmakers then moved to define what it means to complete a sentence.In addition to prison time served, lawmakers directed that all legal financial obligations, including unpaid fines and restitution, would also have to be settled before a felon could be eligible to vote.The Florida Rights Restitution Coalition had raised about $5 million before Bloomberg made calls to raise almost $17 million more, according to Bloomberg staffers.The money is targeted for felons who registered to vote while the law was in question and who owe $1,500 or less. That accounts for about 31,100 people, the staffers said. In a state that decided the 2000 presidential election by 537 votes, that could be critical in a year when polls show Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a dead heat.Organizers for the group say they aren’t targeting people registered with a particular political party.“To hell with politics, to hell with any other implications or insinuations, at the end of the day it’s about real people, real lives, American citizens who want to be a part of this,” said Desmond Meade, the group’s executive director. “People with felony convictions have had their voices silenced for so long.”The group said other donors include John Legend, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the Miami Dolphins, the Orlando Magic, the Miami Heat and Stephen Spielberg.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

(AP) - A Louisiana state trooper has died following a single- vehicle highway crash that happened just hours after he learned he would be fired for his role last year in the in-custody death of a Black man.Master Trooper Chris Hollingsworth was pronounced dead Tuesday following a brief hospitalization, Warren Lee, chief investigator for the Ouachita Parish Coroner’s Office, told The Associated Press.Hollingsworth had been airlifted to Shreveport early Monday after crashing his personal vehicle on Interstate 20 near Monroe. Police have not released any details about how the crash occurred.Hours before, Hollingsworth had received word that State Police intended to terminate him following an internal investigation into the May 2019 death of Ronald Greene, a case that has drawn mounting scrutiny and become the subject of a federal civil rights investigation.Authorities initially said Greene died after crashing his vehicle into a tree following a high-speed chase in rural northern Louisiana that began over an unspecified traffic violation. But Greene’s family alleges troopers used excessive force and “brutalized” him while taking him into custody.State Police, despite growing pressure, have repeatedly declined to release body-camera footage and other records related to Greene’s arrest, citing the ongoing investigations.Greene’s family called for “the immediate arrest of the remaining men responsible for this tragic and unnecessary death.”“Trooper Hollingsworth’s family has the finality of knowing exactly how he died as their community mourns his loss,” said Lee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney representing the family. “The family of Ronald Greene, however, is still being denied the same finality by the State of Louisiana.”Greene’s family has filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit alleging troopers “brutalized” Greene, used a stun gun on him three times and “left him beaten, bloodied and in cardiac arrest” before covering up his actual cause of death.The controversy deepened last week when Greene’s family released graphic photographs showing deep bruises and cuts to his face, and other photos showing his car with little damage. That raised questions about whether Greene received those injuries in a car crash — as authorities initially told his family — or when troopers arrested him.State Police have said only that the 49-year-old Greene died “after resisting arrest and a struggle with troopers” who took him into custody. The agency opened an internal investigation into the case last month.It was not immediately clear what impact Hollingsworth’s death would have on ongoing investigations. Hollingsworth was the only one of the six troopers involved who had been placed on leave. That came Sept. 9 — the same day the AP filed a records request for body camera footage of Greene’s arrest.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

“It has heightened my attitude toward safety, but especially when I get on that four-wheeler,” Endorf said about the near-death experience when he was 64.
 In August 2018, he had loaded a 15-gallon sprayer on the back of his Honda Foreman ES 4x4 and went out to spray trees on his property. At about 11:15 a.m., he started looking at his watch to figure out how much time he could spend working before he headed to town for an appreciation luncheon at the local co-op. He had boxed himself into a brushy area and backed up without looking.
 The rear wheel dropped off, and he and the machine rolled down the steep bank.
 “For a full year after I had that accident, I never put that sprayer on there. To me that was a contributing factor,” Endorf said. The weight of a tank of liquid, even 15 gallons, affects the center of balance and handling on an ATV.
 Since then, he has used the sprayer on the four-wheeler, but he focuses on staying present in his task and slowing down.
 “If you watch my (Telling the Story Project) video, I mention a couple times, you have to get your mind on what you’re doing. Safety is a mental issue also,” he said. “You have to slow down a little bit, think a little bit more about what you’re doing at the moment.”


--DocBreak--
David Endorf was distracted when he backed up his ATV over the edge of a dry creek. The Nebraska farmer dropped 7 feet, hitting his head, shoulder and hip. His leg was pinned beneath the overturned four-wheeler, and he had no way to get it off or get out.
 In a series of fortunate events, his damaged cellphone still worked, he was able to direct neighbors to his location, and he wasn’t seriously hurt. Endorf was lucky to be alive.
 But the incident shook him and made him more aware of farm safety and doing tasks safely. Endorf shared his experience through the Telling the Story Project, in which farmers and families talk about injuries and close calls with prevention messages. Telling the Story Project recounts many of the dangers found on farms and in agriculture settings. National Farm Safety and Health Week, Sept. 20-26, aims to raise awareness and encourage safe practices.

    El Teatro Auditorio Riberas del Guadaíra, en Alcalá de Guadaíra (Sevilla), alzará el telón la noche del 17 de octubre a las 21,00 horas para el XL Festival Flamenco Joaquín el de la Paula en cuyo transcurso se rendirá homenaje muy especial a la Cadena Ser por su labor siempre de apoyo y divulgación al flamenco.
    En la presentación de la cita, que ha tenido lugar en el Hotel Oromana, el delegado de Flamenco y Cultura del Ayuntamiento, Enrique Pavón, ha manifestado su agradecimiento a todos los artistas y profesionales que hacen posible que, en un año tan particular como éste debido a la pandemia, estén presentes formando parte de este importante evento con el que Alcalá hace grande el flamenco.
    "Esta pandemia no podrá con el flamenco", ha expresado el responsable municipal ante la presencia de numerosos artistas como José Mercé, Arcángel, El Pele, Nano de Jerez, el director comercial de la Cadena Ser, Ildefonso Vergara y muchos otros artistas que han asistido al acto de presentación.

    Como preludio a este acontecimiento, el viernes 25 de septiembre a las 21,00 horas se desarrollará en los exteriores de La Harinera y guardando todas las medidas de seguridad el XIII Festival de Cante Flamenco Manolito el de María, cuya entrada es por invitación que puede recogerse en la Casa de la Cultura.

At a time when most people are stuck at home and unable to travel, and the global airline industry has been decimated by the pandemic, flights that take off and return to the airport a few hours later allow airlines to keep staff working. The practice also satisfies that itch to travel — even if it’s just being on a plane again. Although most people may think of flying as a means to an end, existing solely to get them from one place to the next, some say that it is an exciting part of the travel experience. For those people, flights to nowhere are the salve for a year in which just about all travel has been canceled and people have been fearful of airlines not enforcing social distancing and mask-wearing rules.
 Royal Brunei has run five of these flights since mid-August, and since Brunei has had very few cases of the coronavirus, the airline is not requiring passengers to wear masks, but staff members are. Earlier in the month, the Taiwanese airline EVA Air filled all 309 seats on its Hello Kitty-themed A330 Dream jet for Father’s Day in Taiwan, and Japan’s All Nippon Airways had a Hawaiian-resort-themed, 90-minute-flight with 300 people on board.
 On Thursday, Qantas announced a flight to nowhere over Australia. That flight sold out in 10 minutes.
 “So many of our frequent flyers are used to being on a plane every other week and have been telling us they miss the experience of flying as much as the destinations themselves,” Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas Airways, said in a statement this week, when that airline announced its seven-hour flight in October that would depart and land in Sydney.

In the first half of 2020, TikTok removed over 3.7 crore videos in India for violating its community guidelines, the company owned by China’s ByteDance said in its transparency report released Tuesday. These were among the 10.5 crore videos removed from the platform across the world. The most videos were removed in India, followed by the US. The report covers January to June 2020, before TikTok was banned in India, along with 58 other Chinese apps. Before the ban, India was one of TikTok’s biggest markets with close to 660 million installs since its launch in 2017. TikTok is also under pressure in the US. The report said more than a third of the videos taken down contained nudity and sexual content. Separately, the company has also proposed a global coalition of social media firms for content moderation as they increasingly come under fire for spreading misinformation and violating privacy.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — It will take 40,000 or more poll workers to run the fall election in Pennsylvania, and while some counties are on track to have fully staffed polling places, with six weeks to go, officials aren't sure whether there will be a repeat of the primary's coronavirus-driven shortages. A law passed this spring by the Republican-led Legislature let the counties, which handle the nuts and bolts of elections, assign poll workers to any precinct in their home county for the primary only. Poll workers are normally restricted to working in the precincts where they live. A proposal to make that provision permanent has stalled in the General Assembly, along with other election mechanics changes. Passed by the House earlier this month, mostly along party lines, a bill that would relax poll worker residency rules is opposed for other reasons by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. House Republican spokesman Jason Gottesman said that caucus members would welcome “engagement from the governor” on the election law changes, and that short of that “everything remains hypothetical as to what could get done.” Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said her sense is that the poll worker shortage is not as acute as it was in the primary. \"But there are likely still shortages and many counties have told me that being able to move poll workers was critical in June and that they would very much like to see this made permanent,” Schaefer said in an email. The Department of State, which handles election-related matters, has fielded and passed along about 39,000 queries from people who want to work the polls.
