In 2003 China began delivering the HQ-9 to its army and navy (on ships). In the beginning, the HQ-9 was a much less capable system, at least on paper. A decade of development and upgrades is believed to have benefitted from data stolen from similar American and Russian systems. The HQ-9 radar apparently derived a lot of technology from that used in the Russian S-300 system. The HQ-9 missile itself is similar to the U.S. "Patriot." The first HQ-9 missiles had a max range of about 100 kilometres, weighed 1.3 tons, and had a passive (no broadcasting) seeker in the missile. The Patriot missile weighs a ton (for the 70 kilometre range version) and a third of a ton for the 20 kilometre range anti-missile only version. The S-300 missiles weigh 1.8 tons and have a range of 200 kilometres. The HQ-9 export model, FD-2000, is believed to have removed the more obvious items stolen from American and Russian systems. This reduces capability a bit but makes the FD-2000 more resistant to lawsuits over stolen technology.

SPRINGFIELD - Top leaders of the Illinois House and Senate say there is still no timetable for calling lawmakers back into session, but they have launched a process for narrowing down the topics they'll need to address whenever they do return.
   
 In recent weeks, both the House and Senate have formed what they are calling "working groups" that are focusing primarily on how to resume state services and reboot the state's economy once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
   
 The House has organized 14 such working groups, focusing on policy areas such as access to health care, economic recovery, child welfare, food accessibility, education and mental health and addiction.
   
 In the Senate, there are 17 working groups focusing on many of the same topics as well as the state budget, executive orders, gaming, regulatory relief and unemployment insurance.
   
 Officials have been careful, though, to stress that the working groups are not legislative committees and that they are not authorized to draft legislation, hear testimony or take votes.
   
 "These are far more informal," Rep. Michael Zalewski, a Riverside Democrat and co-chair of the House economic recovery working group, said this week. "I think they're simply ways for us to congregate and hear each other out and compare notes and ideas about what we're going to face in the near future, when we do return to normal regular order."
   
 The difference between "working groups" and legislative committees is important because Article IV, Section 5 of the Illinois Constitution requires all meetings of the General Assembly, as well as legislative committees and commissions to be open to the public, unless two-thirds of the chamber votes to close them.
   
 Scott Szala, who teaches about the state Constitution at the University of Illinois College of Law, said the drafters probably never anticipated a situation like the one the General Assembly now faces, and there have been no Supreme Court cases since the Constitution was ratified in 1970 to clarify how far that provision extends.
   
 In fact, he said, the only case dealing with that constitutional provision came in 2001 when the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit filed by the Illinois Press Association and several member newspapers against then-Gov. George Ryan over media access to meetings of legislative and executive ethics commissions. The court rejected that suit on the grounds that the governor was not a proper defendant in the case.
   
 Zalewski agreed that the drafters of the state Constitution probably didn't envision such a scenario.
   
 "I think that it's incumbent upon us to at least somewhat organize ourselves into policy silos to be ready for whatever's coming next," he said.
   
 Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, said he accepts the fact that the working groups have only a limited charge.
   
 "I would have to tell you that I think if we have to do any votes or anything substantive like that, we're going to have to be back to the Capitol, I think, in order to effectively make sure that what we're doing is seen by the electorate and that people have the opportunity to be part of it," he said.
   
 Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, also a Bloomington Republican but no relation to Dan Brady, said the working groups are needed so lawmakers can focus on the tasks that will face them when they reconvene.
   
 "These are challenging and difficult times. (Senate) President (Don) Harmon and I talked about what we can do to work on making sure that the legislators were educated and we didn't lose the time that we have to do that," he said.
   
 Reopening the Economy
   
 Zalewski said one of the most pressing tasks - one that he said state government has little control over - will be getting the state's economy up and running again, which he said could take a very long time.
   
 "I think it's going to be slower than many people would desire," he said. "I think that we're going to need a lot of economic stimulus from the federal government because they have the ability to inject immediate capital into the economy. Our ability to inject capital is far less available. What we're able to do is promote specific policy proposals that, down the line, could produce economic activity."
   
 Republicans have recently called for a strategic reopening of sectors of the economy in the coming days, and Gov. JB Pritzker has hinted at changes to his stay-at-home order, which is scheduled to end April 30.
   
 Sen. Brady said in a phone call he would like to see the data Pritzker is relying upon so it could inform a regionalized approach to opening some businesses. He specifically pointed to hospitals that indicate they can reopen for certain procedures while still handling COVID-19 cases.
   
 He said data may indicate some areas are ready for openings sooner than others.
   
 "We need to plan for that," he said. "We need to tell the people of Illinois what the benchmarks are."
   
 A group of House Republicans on Wednesday called on the governor to allow hospitals to resume performing cancer screenings and other kinds of elective procedures, to allow many retail establishments to reopen provided they follow safety guidelines, and to reopen state parks.
   
 Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, said during a video news conference that the stay- at-home order that took effect March 21 has been successful and has probably saved many lives, but he said the people of Illinois also need to get back to work.
   
 "We've slowed the spread of COVID-19. We've bent the curve, allowing our health care workers to be more safe and better able to do their jobs," he said. "This has been important work. We've all made sacrifices together because this is going to be a long process as we go forward. But now we are looking at how we go forward and how we think about economic recovery in the state of Illinois."
   
 During his daily COVID-19 briefing in Chicago, however, Pritzker said the state still needs more capacity to test for the disease, to trace all of the people who have come into contact with infected patients, and build up an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, before it can reopen the economy.
   
 "While we're working very hard on PPE and testing and spinning up a contact tracing effort that will be very large at the end, those are three things we have to work on and we're not there yet," he said.

Moreover, if the “very critical” data on the condition of the vineyard, provided by some producers, were reliable, then how can they explain that Giulio produced over 1.000 bottles per year on average (during the 2019 vintage they produced 850 liters of Barolo Cannubi, relative documentation attached). According to the maximum limits the specifications allow, only up to 896 liters of Barolo can be produced on a 1.600 square meter plot. Further, considering the alleged diseased plants, the age of the vineyards and the presence of three rows of Barbera in the vineyard, one wonders how, in fact, it was possible to achieve such a production volume. The information we have received from Giulio, states that the conditions of the vineyard were not as precarious as one would believe, to justify the removal of the vineyard”.

Grier wouldn't talk about the rookie challenging for a starting job this year, either.
 "With the pandemic and all that's going on, our doctors haven't seen him," Grier said. "We have a long way to go before we can say who's doing what. We have to just get him and have a meeting first. I think it's way too early to speculate on this year and how this is going to go."
 This offseason has been a long one for Tagovailoa, and not just because he hasn't played a game since Nov. 16.
 For one thing, he lost his car in a tornado that hit the Nashville, Tennessee, area last month.
 "It was about 1 o'clock in the morning," Tagovailoa told reporters shortly after being drafted Thursday night. "Sirens were going off and I was asleep. I ended up waking up to I guess warnings on my phone. Three or four minutes later, a tornado just swooped right over my complex, destroys my car and everything there. It was pretty bad."
 Tornadoes on March 3 killed 25 people in Middle Tennessee and damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings. Tagovailoa was in Nashville to work out and rehabilitate his hip.
 All in all, Tagovailoa said, it has been a stressful stretch, partly because he didn't know where he would be drafted.
 "I went through that tornado; my car got destroyed," he said. "I'm going through rehab during that process. And then there's a lot of uncertainty at the same time. There were just a lot of things piling up. This was probably the most difficult time for me in my life."
 After being drafted, however, the Hawaiian wore a grin — and a lei.
 "A dream come true, man, to be able to have this opportunity," Tagovailoa said.

President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly told Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp that they approved of his aggressive plan to allow businesses to reopen, just a day before Trump pulled an about-face and publicly bashed the plan, according to two administration officials.
 The green light from Pence and Trump came in separate private conversations with the Republican governor both before Kemp announced his plan to ease coronavirus restrictions and after it was unveiled on Monday, the officials said. Trump's sudden shift came only after top health advisers reviewed the plan more closely and persuaded the president that Kemp was risking further spread of the virus by moving too quickly.
 "I told the governor of Georgia Brian Kemp that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities," Trump said Wednesday, just a day after telling reporters that he trusted Kemp's judgment. "He knows what's he's doing."

On Monday April 13, the city of Thompson Falls broke ground at Ainsworth Park, a long-awaited project hoped to bring much to better the town. The project has been in the works since prior to 2015, when the first donation was received. Since then several parties have helped move the project along, from Thompson Falls Mainstreet, to the Thompson Falls Parks Planning Committee and finally to the city of Thompson Falls. Ainsworth has had a long journey to fruition. A long journey considering it started from barren grounds with old bleachers removed because they were a safety hazard.
 At a total cost of $552,000, Ainsworth aims to bring several improvements to the area. The first large part of the park will include an amphitheater with grass terrace seating and a stage. This part of the project’s funding was secured by a local non-profit called the Frisbie Morbella Foundation. They contributed $25,000.
 The next part of the project will be a trail that runs around the property. This will allow access for those with special mobility needs around the park. It will also connect and allow safe travel around the veteran’s memorial, already build on the park grounds. Veterans interested can still ask to have their name and rank added on one of the etched bricks to commemorate their service.
 There will also be a shelter with picnic tables and dual bathrooms, along with landscaping done throughout the grounds.
 The project was originally planned to be done through three stages, however planning through several years proved difficult and the final construction cost quite expensive. The city took the project on and used match funds, raised by the Thompson Falls Parks Planning Committee, equal to $70,000, to apply for several grants making up the rest of the money. Of those match funds nearly $50,000 was put toward engineering. The project almost didn’t happen because the estimated cost from the engineers was too high. When the cost finally came down, the winner of the bid to build was Bob Taylor with Taylor Services.
 The remaining funds came from a Montana Department of Commerce Community Development Block Grant. Generally, the grant has been utilized to fund community “critical needs” projects such as those associated with hospitals. This will be the first time the grant has been applied “taking into consideration tourism oriented economic needs as well as community development in recreation,” says Jen Kreiner of Sanders County Community Development Corporation.
 According to Kreiner, the money would have been near impossible to raise in such a small community and a “huge job with such limited resources,” especially without the aid earned after presenting the match funds as leverage. “We are so limited here it just made sense,” said Kreiner about applying for the grant.
 The Montana Office of Tourism also contributed $46,000 to the project, which is expected to be complete, or nearly so, by July 31, 2020. Access should be allowed by late summer of this year.

As far as Arkansas women's basketball coach Mike Neighbors is concerned, the coronavirus shutdown hasn't really made a big difference for him or his team.
   
 Normally at this time of the year, right after a season ends, Neighbors gives the Razorbacks several weeks off. The only difference, of course, is that when Neighbors still has the chance to talk to his players these days, he can't do it face-to-face.
   
 "We've tried to keep it normal as if they were here, and if they were on campus at this point in time, this would be a time where we probably would have the least contact that we do in a year anyway," Neighbors said during a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon.
   
 "We give them weeks off after we get finished with our season and then we slowly but surely have individual meetings, so it's not been that different as far as communication with our kids, it's just been a different form of technology; it's not been a face-to-face meeting."
   
 Plus, Neighbors already has some other things on his plate away from basketball to occupy his time during the shutdown.
   
 "It's really lucky that it's come at a time in my personal life that there's plenty of stuff to turn the focus to," he said. "My daughter's wedding is still on for June 6, my son is graduating high school whenever that happens, we had a flood in our house that happened back near the end of the season that has required a complete renovation of the downstairs so we've started that. ... Needless to say, I've been staying plenty, plenty busy."
   
 But that doesn't mean that Neighbors has put basketball on the back burner.
   
 Far from it, especially after the Razorbacks recently landed graduate transfer Destiny Slocum, a graduate transfer who spent the past two seasons playing at Oregon State and one season prior to that at Maryland.
   
 In her two seasons at Oregon State, Slocum averaged 15.2 points and 4.6 assists per game. She was also an All-Pac-12 selection both years.
   
 At Maryland, Slocum was named the Women's Basketball Coaches Association's Freshman of the Year before she transferred to Oregon State.
   
 Her arrival to Arkansas comes with plenty of ironic twists, as it wasn't the first time Slocum and Neighbors have crossed paths.
   
 In the fall of 2014, before her junior season playing high school basketball outside Boise, Idaho, Slocum committed to Washington, where Neighbors was the coach at the time. But the following season, Slocum's senior year, she de- committed to Washington and ended up signing with Maryland.
   
 That same season, Neighbors led Washington to the Women's Final Four, beating Maryland along the way to reach the Elite Eight.
   
 Then after Slocum's freshman season at Maryland, she received her WBCA Freshman of the Year award at the WBCA national awards held during at the Women's Final Four in Dallas, Texas. Neighbors was also in attendance that night, watching his star player at Washington, Kelsey Plum, receive her National Player of the Year award.
   
 "Seated right next to us was Destiny and her family," Neighbors said.
   
 It was also around that same time that Neighbors had agreed in principle to take the Arkansas job. Soon after officially being named the Razorbacks' coach, Neighbors found out Slocum was leaving Maryland and got her to come to Arkansas on a campus visit.
   
 Unfortunately, Slocum's visit came during a heavy rainstorm, as Fayetteville was hit hard with several inches of rain. Slocum eventually decided to go to Oregon State instead.
   
 Now, Neighbors is finally excited to get the chance to coach Slocum after all those years of previous contact.
   
 "As far as position goes, we like to play as many guards as we can. ... Just by looking at her numbers, this is a kid who has been the leading scorer and leading assist person for her teams that all three of them have played in the Sweet 16, so she can score but she's also a passing point guard," Neighbors said. "She fits with us perfectly because we don't really have labeled positions."
   
 Slocum's arrival gives the Razorbacks another senior on what should be a senior-laden squad as Neighbors begins his fourth season at Arkansas, which finished 24-8 before being denied postseason play due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "We had spots on our board and we needed some experience for us to do what we hoped to do. ... We needed somebody that's been through the battles and we obviously couldn't have found anybody better than that, somebody that's been in two Power Five conferences already and has helped her team advance deep in the tournament," Neighbors said.
   
 The coach also took some time to delve into some other subjects Thursday, especially outside of basketball. For instance, Neighbors said he was finally able to see the movie "Greater," about the late Brandon Burlsworth, the Arkansas walk-on turned All-American offensive lineman.
   
 "I had never seen 'Greater;' I had never seen the Brandon Burlsworth story, and I started getting inundated with people saying, 'Hey, I watched this movie about the Arkansas walk-on,'" Neighbors said. "I knew they had made it; I knew they had shot it over at Farmington and they used Gravette's gym. ... But I had never seen it, so I sat down and watched it and it was tremendous."
   
 Neighbors also talked about the departure of Mississippi State coach Vic Schaefer, who recently took over at Texas. Both Neighbors and Schaefer worked together at Arkansas under Gary Blair, now the coach at Texas A&M.;
   
 "I was floored. ... You would have never seen me bet one dollar on Vic (going to Texas), but it makes sense," Neighbors said. "When you look now and seeing potential cuts going on at Mississippi State and Vic's a Texas guy, and I don't think there's any sign that Coach Blair is retiring any time soon, yes it makes sense now that you look back at it.
   
 "But honestly, I'm glad he's out of the league (Southeastern Conference), I'm not going to hold back on that. He had built Mississippi State into a monster; I'm not going to say that Nikki (McCray-Penson, who replaced Schaefer at Mississippi State) is not going to keep it going, but I know Vic and what he had done and proven it. (They were the) hardest team probably for us to play against, even mentioning South Carolina."
