As far as the second goes, eh. It was always possible with the talent at the position but people were much more on Baun, Gross-Matos, Erz, the Houston OT whose name I forgot, one of the safeties, etc. So, I disagree that people thought we were going WR early as much as they were just throwing some names out like Claypool if we decided to go WR early. Gettleman made it very clear that the OL needed to be fixed once and for all. No way he was passing on one of these tackles. And no way was he waiting until the third to address our poor ass defense. And hearing the rumors from guys that have proven to be in the know it sounded like McKinney and Baun were legit options at 2 and potentially Espensa (sp?).

  Throwing open the French doors of my guest room at Bernardus Lodge & Spa in Carmel Valley, California, and mid-sip from a glass of the resort's eponymous Sauvignon Blanc, I ruminated on the risks and rewards of travel during this unsettling time.


  I was distracted for a moment, not only by the crisp and expressive Monterey County wine in my hand, but by a rabbit hopping among the lavender blooms just a few feet away. I rather envied this cotton-tailed cutie who appeared blissfully unaware of the travails of life during a pandemic.


  This Forbes-rated, four-star open luxury resort was just three hours from my home in Napa Valley, for which I was grateful, as driving seems the safest option for a travel adventure now. With my four-legged travel companion, Freddie, in tow, and my next-door neighbor, Tara -- the two closest connections I've had for the past several months -- we hit the road, giddy at the prospect of a change of scenery.


  Arriving at Bernardus, we were greeted by a masked bellman who explained where to park, since there would be no valet service on this visit. We were offered and accepted, however, assistance with our luggage. Check-in was swift, with a plexiglass partition at the front desk, social distancing in place and a reminder about mandatory mask-wearing on the property. All signed in, I availed myself a dollop of hand sanitizer from the bottle I spotted in front of me, available for guest use.


  This resort has remained open for business throughout the pandemic, which means they've had plenty of time to adhere and adjust to California's health guidelines for guests. The lodge, in fact, was almost fully booked while I was there. Yet, there's plentiful open space on the property for guests to stroll, including an exquisite rose garden within which raised beds of organic produce are grown exclusively for use by Executive Chef Cal Stamenov and his sensory- stoking culinary offerings.


  Everywhere I turn, lavender is in aromatic bloom, even between the purplish artichokes stretched skyward from Cal's garden. Notably, the rose garden is strategically sited so as to frame the view of Bernardus' estate vineyards, with its backdrop of the Santa Lucia Mountains.


  Reservations are required for outdoor seating at the resort's Lucia Restaurant & Bar, and diners share a single-use paper menu at every meal.


  Tara and I feel almost mischievous as we remove our face masks in order to eat, yet we were also conscious of the increased risk to the waitstaff. We accepted a pour of the sparkling rose we brought in celebration of our outing and gleefully toasted to a dinner we did not have to cook ourselves.


  Only one thing could have made the experience feel more decadent -- to be seated at the Chef's Table within the kitchen where the walls are adorned with scratched signatures of various celebrities, including culinary great and native Californian Julia Child. That experience is not being offered until post-pandemic.


  Honestly, it has been so long since I've been in a restaurant that I'd almost forgotten how much pleasure there is in dining out.


  After that, I was primed for a hot, detoxifying salt bath in the luxuriously deep soaking tub in my room, followed by a nightcap while seated next to the in-room fireplace. Minutes later, I fell into a trance-like sleep.


  The next day, Tara, Freddie and I got back in the car for a drive into the nearby village of Carmel. There, a full mile of artisan shops and more than 20 tasting rooms beckoned. But wait, many of those rooms were not open, thanks to COVID-19. So, our plan switched to a walk on the beach at Carmel-by-the-Sea.


  Yikes! The temperature by the ocean was at least 20 degrees cooler than the valley, bringing on the shivers, so we hiked back uphill, donned our masks and power-shopped for a while. We grabbed a snack at an outdoor courtyard restaurant before retreating back to our secluded deck at the Lodge. That evening, takeout pizza from Lucia Restaurant seemed like the ideal solution for supper. We scarfed it down while polishing off the last of the Bernardus Sauvignon Blanc.


  How did it feel to travel, sleep, shop and eat in the age of COVID-19? Truth be told, the adventure satiated my need to get out and feel normal, and I was grateful for the opportunity to do it, especially at such a lovely spot as Bernardus, but I could not shake a deep awareness of being \"on guard,\" never forgetting all of the extreme precautions that I -- and others employed in the hospitality industry -- took to make it happen. Odd and eerie at times? Yes. But worth it? Absolutely.

With entries to Nutrien's inaugural sale closing this week, numbers look on track for a catalogue of around 270 trotting and pacing yearlings that will go under the hammer over the weekend of 10th and 11th of April 2021.
 The sale will be held at the impressive Inglis - Oakland's Junction Complex, with horses expected to be on hand from Thursday 8th. Nutrien plans to take full advantage of the fantastic facilities and areas with a  sale parade and welcome function planned for Friday 9th April.
 Mark Barton, the General Manager of Nutrien Equine Standardbred, has been impressed by the industry in welcoming Nutriens entry into the harness racing sales arena. "It is a privilege to offer a catalogue of horses in one sale of this quality. We want to celebrate the event with the industry and can't wait until April next year comes around."
 "We are impressed with the way the industry has adapted to the challenges that they have faced in recent time, it shows the resilience of the people that are involved and I think our sale event will be a great place for all to celebrate the industry and the sport of Harness Racing."
 Catalogues for the Nutrien sale will be available in December 2019, with their interactive online catalogue expected around November. Nutrien's Mark Barton commented - "We have developed our online catalogue over the past few years for our performance horse sales, which allows vendors to regularly update information about their sale horses as more results come to hand for their sale horses. Buyers simply "Follow" the horses of interest in the online catalogue and a text will be sent to them every time new information is added to that horse" - Mr Barton said.

“Voting is fundamental to our republic, and we were hoping to remind everyone the importance of voting before the primary on May 10,” he said.
 Unfortunately, COVID-19 led to a temporary shut down for the museum. When it opened again, volunteer Sandy Strey made sure everything was in the right place for the exhibit which is on display until the end of the month.
 The exhibit features a timeline going around the gallery, outlining how the efforts of the suffragettes progressed.
 “Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and some of those women actually came to Nebraska to help the process,” Redfern said.
 After Congress approved the 19th amendment, at least 36 states needed to vote in favor of it before it could become law.
 “This process is called ratification,” she said.
 The Nebraska Legislature voted unanimously to ratify the 19th amendment in 1919, but efforts began long before – 70 years, in fact.
 For just as long, anti-suffragists did all they could to prevent women from voting — from comparing them to criminals and witches to demanding they share their height, weight and age in order to be allowed to vote.
 “They thought that would stop them — that women wouldn’t want to share their age,” said Strey. “They did it, though.”

Obviously, I should have had just water but it was my last night in London, and so after work, I had a few more drinks with my flatmate. In total it was a bottle of mulled wine, three whiskies, half a bottle of prosecco, 60ml of rum and a third of a bottle of wine. The rum was deeply unnecessary but the drinks were tasty.

However, that will not be a strategy that Microsoft will be focusing on for its Xbox Series X consoles. In an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Xbox boss Phil Spencer states that the company's strategy for its new console will be to focus more on accommodating the player, rather than focusing too much on the hardware.


  According to Spencer, _" We should applaud load times and fidelity of scenes and framerate and input latency, and all of these things that we've focused on with the next generation. But that should not exclude people from being able to play. That's our point. How do we create an ecosystem where if you want to play an Xbox game, we're going to give you a way to go play it?"_


  This seems to be a slight dig at Sony who had previously stated that PS5 games will not be backwards compatible with the PS4. This means that gamers who want to play newer PS5 games will need to buy the console in order to play them. While we can appreciate Microsoft's approach, we have to wonder how they will fare.

Finding agreement between competing Democratic and Republican proposals for another COVID-19 relief package and separate police reform legislation could be "a long shot" before Congress begins its month-long summer recess, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said Thursday.
   
 But if it can be done, it's worth delaying the recess, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate said after meeting with local officials and members of the East Peoria Chamber of Commerce.
   
 "We ought to get down to the business of addressing the issues that will affect the economy right here in central Illinois," he said.
   
 Among provisions Durbin supports in another relief package is an extension of the federal boost on unemployment benefits that offers an additional $600 per week to recipients, and which is currently slated to expire July 31.
   
 "That would be devastating for so many families across the state," Durbin said, noting the latest Illinois unemployment statistics that show 946,400 people receiving unemployment assistance. Some 47 million are receiving those benefits nationwide.
   
 "If we don't push more activity into this economy, give people who are laid off the resources they need to keep their families together at home, pay their rent, pay their mortgages, put food on the table, the basics in life, then it's going to be a dramatic hardship on those families, and it will not help this economy recover," Durbin said, pointing out that such assistance is likely to be returned directly into the economy.
   
 He also shared his concern about Peoria Charter Coach's financial difficulties. On Wednesday the company announced it was laying off 95% of its staff and renewed its please for more federal and state aid. Durbin said he was looking into what other federal assistance might be available for the company.
   
 Later in the day, U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood introduced bipartisan House legislation mirroring a bipartisan Senate measure that would provide $10 billion in grant funding and other aid to companies like Peoria Charter, as well as school bus companies and other transportation providers.
   
 Company owner Bill Winkler said in a prepared statement that such an approach could give the "motorcoach industry a fighting chance to survive the pandemic."
   
 Durbin expressed his support for a number of elements in the House-passed HEROES Act that's considered unlikely to be brought to the floor in its current form by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. That includes aid to local governments.
   
 "I think that is essential," Durbin said.
   
 He's also a backer of another economic stimulus bill on top of the one earlier this year that provided $1,200 to each adult and $500 for each child in a household.
   
 This time, Durbin believes, everyone ought to receive $1,200 regardless of age.
   
 "Will President Trump be able to sign the checks again? Be my guest, if that's what it takes to get this passed, I think that helping hand is really needed for families." he said.

India on Friday said it had surpassed 1 million cases, third only to the United States and Brazil, with nearly 25,000 deaths. The grim milestone drove home concerns over the country's readiness to deal with an inevitable surge that could overwhelm hospitals and test the country’s feeble health care system.
 In Bangalore, a city that prides itself as the center of of Indian technology innovation, the government ordered a weeklong lockdown that began Tuesday evening after the cases surged exponentially.
 Local governments are frantically trying to quash outbreaks and keep their economies running as the pandemic spreads in the vast countryside.
 “The acceleration in cases remains the main challenge for India in the coming days,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, adding that a vast majority of cases were still being missed.
 China on Friday reported nine imported cases and one instance of local transmission, in Xinjiang, where health officials were monitoring three other people and flights to and from the regional capital, Urumqi, reportedly were being restricted.
 The Muslim-majority region is so far from Beijing that residents operate by their own, unofficial time zone and had until now been little affected by outbreaks elsewhere that appear to have been brought under control.
 Efforts were underway to trace contacts of the factory worker who fell ill, the Urumqi Health Commission said on its WeChat social media site.
 Meanwhile, in Indonesia, large-scale restrictions in its capital were set to continue as new COVID-19 cases rise, with cinemas and other indoor entertainment spaces to remain closed.
 “It will be very risky if we loosen the first phase of large-scale social restrictions to the second phase. So we decided to extend the social restrictions,” said Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan.
 As of Thursday, 15,636 cases with 713 deaths had been recorded in Jakarta. The city imposed sweeping social restrictions on April 10 but relaxed some of them two months later. Indonesia as a whole has reported nearly 82,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,800 deaths.
 In South Korea, officials said they might be making headway in capping outbreaks that have expanded from the capital, Seoul.
 South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still reported 60 newly confirmed infections, including 39 linked to people arriving from abroad.
 But a senior Health Ministry official, Yoon Tae-ho, told reporters that the imported cases were less of a concern than local ones because they would be caught in a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all people arriving from abroad. All are to be tested within 3 days.
 More than 13.7 million infections have been confirmed worldwide and nearly 590,000 have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are likely higher for various reasons, including limited testing.
 Two-week quarantines are becoming the norm, and many governments have been rolling back reopenings and tightening restrictions to try to stave off further waves of new cases.

In its first year of operation, Gokada was said to have secured 1,000 bikes giving around 5,000 rides across the crowded city each day.
 But the firm ran into difficulty in February of this year after a ban went into effect that expressly forbid motorbike taxis.
 The ban came suddenly and without warning after the Lagos state government said a ban was needed because of 'accidents, and disorderliness caused by the vehicles'.
 As a result of the ban, commuters were left stranded and many were forced to travel on packed public transport instead.
 The firm stopped bringing in money and around 800 bikers working for Gorkada were o immediately laid off.
 The ban came at a difficult moment for Gokada which had just raised $5.3 million in funding from Rise Capital, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm, in May 2019.
 'As a business, we kind of have to just roll with the punches and a lot of those people that we had to lay off were very focused on the transport sector of the business,' Saleh told CNN earlier this year.
 In an emotional plea to Nigerian officials to reverse the decision in February, Saleh said: 'It's not my country. It's a country that I feel has amazing potential and amazing people and an opportunity to shine.
 'The drivers, every one of them, wasn't there because they just wanted to make money. They were there because they had families, children, dreams, they wanted to start businesses. They wanted to go to school.
 'They had degrees already but they couldn't find jobs. We were hoping that a lot of these drivers wouldn't be drivers forever, we were hoping that we could place them in higher jobs in Gokada and create a beautiful community which was developing slowly and,it was really something that moved me to the point where I was OK putting all my money in, all my effort in.
 'Gokada is not just a business. We do things that nobody else did at the time.
 'This has definitely been a blow.'
 The company decided to attempt to pivot and become a delivery and logistics company with a new boat hailing service that would run vessels that could hold up to 24 people - but then the global pandemic struck, putting future plans on hold.
 'The drivers here at Gokada, were not there to make money, they were here because they had families, they have children, they have dreams,' Saleh told Nirametrics.
 'They want to start businesses, they want to go to school, they have degrees already, but they couldn't find jobs. For many, Gokada wasn't the final place for their life. It was a stepping stone to get to that next endeavor.'
 'What I will tell you is that Gokada is not just a business, it's a mission. And every part of that mission is to always be safe, provide jobs.'

Trump's willingness to accept new council was already in the works ahead of Wednesday's shakeup, and some advisers were heartened by his speech this week in the Rose Garden that, although meandering, contained his most sustained attacks against Biden. Trump was finally framing the election as a choice between two visions of America -- not just a referendum on his own divisive presidency. In recent days he has repeatedly underscored the campaign's new dystopian theme that Biden is under the control of leftist elements determined to destroy the American way of life.

San Diego County officials leading the local coronavirus response have repeatedly said in recent weeks that their decisions on which businesses and activities should cease or modify their operations would be based on the available data. The idea was to focus most intently on the places associated with the greatest numbers of infections.
 Unlike restaurants, especially those with bars, personal care businesses have not been among the daily list of community outbreaks shared by the health department daily.
 Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county’s public health officer, said a lack of outbreaks is not enough.
 “While there might not be an outbreak, individuals are associated with these particular locations, so we are following the data,” Wooten said.
 The county has not yet provided a full accounting of infections by business or location type, despite regular requests from the public and media.
 Wooten added that the county’s code compliance division is working with the state to put together “strike teams” that will enforce the rules. No information was immediately available on when those teams might start their work.
 Decisions to go along with the governor’s recommendations have continued to chafe some on the county Board of Supervisors, especially Supervisor Jim Desmond, who was quick to put out a statement July 13 that called the move “unwarranted.”
 “Our hospital numbers are not going up. Our testing is focused on the most vulnerable and those with symptoms, which is why you see an increase,” Desmond said. “In light of today’s decision, we must look at all options so that our businesses have a chance of surviving.”
 The shift to outdoor-only operations will be easier on some businesses than others.
 Aided by an executive order from Mayor Kevin Faulconer that waived permits for outdoor dining, many restaurants in San Diego have begun shifting their operations to sidewalks and patios.
 But ambiguity remains about whether businesses such as gyms and retail stores will get the same treatment.
 Retailers at the region’s outdoor shopping malls, such as Westfield UTC, likely won’t see much change.
 Several church leaders in San Diego County said they will continue to follow the governor’s latest health orders, though some are frustrated at the back- and-forth process.
 Some said their churches are not affected by the new order prohibiting indoor services because they weren’t holding any, while others said they were about to start and now have to change their plans.
 In May, Newsom amended restrictions on churches and allowed meetings of no more than 25 percent of a room’s capacity, or 100 people, whichever number was lower. The new restrictions do not allow any indoor seating.

Dr. Jackson said the finalized plan will be presented to the school board at 1 p.m. Wednesday for approval. The meeting will be streamed for the public and media on the school system’s YouTube channel. The link will be available on the system’s website.
 “Nothing is more important than the health and well being of our students and staff,” Dr. Jackson said.
 He noted plans are based on Gov. Roy Cooper’s announcement Tuesday that public schools can reopen at reduced in-classroom capacity but gives parents and school districts the choice to have classes entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Previously, Gov. Cooper requested school systems plan for reopening under three scenarios. Plan A is based on all students being present in school with social distancing precautions in place.
 Plan B was originally based on 50% or less of the student body present with social distancing precautions in place. However, Dr. Jackson said Thursday that has now changed from 50% capacity to the number of students that will keep them 6 feet apart.
 “For us, that may very well work out to be about 50 percent capacity,” Dr. Jackson said. “We will be measuring buildings.”
 Plan C is based on all students participating in remote learning only.
 During Tuesday’s press conference, Gov. Cooper called for school systems to put Plan B into place. He further gave districts and parents the option to choose Plan C.
 With Plan B, Dr. Jackson said there will be many safety protocols in place to protect students and staff, including wearing masks and 6-foot social distancing.
 Even as plans are being finalized, Dr. Jackson reminded the board staff must be prepared to change quickly under the governor’s direction if there’s a spike in coronavirus cases.
 “We want to be able to move from one scenario to another quickly,” he said.
 Dr. Jackson reviewed the seven committees and some of the many details each is tasked with working through. The committees are health and well-being, instructional delivery and curriculum, athletics and extracurricular activities, transportation, facility maintenance, child nutrition and communication and stakeholder engagement.
 Principals chair the seven committees, which also include teachers, assistant principals, custodians, cafeteria managers, school nurses and others.

Much of the conversation ended up circling back to the recent push to defund the Police Department by 50%, a move the majority of City Council members have said they support. Beach said she disagrees with the demand, and was disappointed with city leaders for "bandwagoning" on to the movement.
 “I get their pain, I get their rage. I get it. And I don’t want to take that from them," Beach said. "I feel the same way. But I feel like we need to take a deep breath and come to the table calmly so we can work it out.”
 A woman named Alexis, who asked to only give her first name, said she agrees the city needs more social services, but added she's not sure slashing the police budget is the correct step.
 "I've been wanting to hear from SPD for a while. I was grateful that they hosted this," she said. "I think I gained perspective, a chance to actually talk to the police … When you see them on the (police) line, it's just a bunch of interchangeable people in basically giant padded marshmallow suits. They don't seem like people."
 Assistant Chief Eric Greening also attended the discussion to explain what cutting the budget by 50% could mean for many youth programs and recent hires. One officer told the group that anyone with 13 years of experience or fewer could be at risk of losing their job. What areas and programs would potentially be cut has not been decided by the City Council or the Police Department.
 Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said this week she wants to remove $76 million from the Police Department’s budget in 2021, mostly by transferring the city’s 911 call and dispatch center, parking enforcement officers, Office of Police Accountability and Office of Emergency Management outside the department.
 Several officers said Thursday they initially pursued police work to enact change within their communities.
 "Personally I never really thought about how they felt. I really didn't," Smith said after the event. "I've always just been on the other side, totally anti-police … We have a long way to go but if we can start by having these type of meetings and getting people together, I think things will start going in a better direction."

The method of disbursing grants via R3 was crafted by the ICJIA and the Justice, Equity and Opportunity, or JEO, Initiative, which was created via executive order last year to centralize the state’s efforts at criminal justice reform and is led by Stratton.
 The ICJIA is the state agency responsible for administering grants and conducting research relating to criminal justice. The two agencies worked in tandem to craft the process of grant disbursement and eligibility for R3.
 “We have tried to create a program that allows everyone to apply. Nonprofit, local units of government, faith-based organizations, churches, small businesses and community organizations,” Quinn Rallins, director of the JEO Initiative, said during Tuesday’s town hall.
 Any organization that works within an R3-eligible zone can apply for a grant, as long as their proposal falls within one of the five areas of the plan: Civil legal aid, economic development, re-entry for those in the prison system, violence prevention and youth development.

CARVER - School officials are working on a re-entry plan to prepare for an in- person return to school while meeting health and safety requirements, remote learning in two parts and a hybrid of the two.
 Superintendent Scott Knief said in a presentation to the School Committee last week that the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education wants school districts to submit one formal plan by July 31.
 "We're always adjusting to new information," he said, as he shared an outline of a reopening plan that he has also shared with the faculty of both Carver schools and also at a parent meeting attended by as many as 130 parents.
 He said so many parents wanted to be part of the process that he established a parent advisory subcommittee to meet on a weekly basis.
 The School Committee has committed to meeting at 7 p.m. Wednesday, July 29, through remote participation via Zoom to focus on reviewing the final re-entry plan to be presented to the state and making any final suggestions that could result in changes.
 Parents recently answered a survey about having their students return to school with health and safety requirements in place. He said he was not surprised by the results.
 Knief said of the 628 total responses, 68 percent said their students would return in the fall, 5 percent said no and 27 percent said they were unsure with not enough information or they don't know where they will be in six weeks.
 Eighty percent responded that they do not have health concerns in their family that would keep their students at home, and of the 20 percent who do, some would still send their students back.
 As for the hybrid option, Knief said one option is students returning to school half days every day, alternating days, two days in-person and three days remotely and then alternating weeks. He said half days every day was a first choice but ranked lower for another option.
 School Committee member Jenn Pratt said that as a parent she would prefer alternating weeks and knows teachers who also prefer that to half days based on the amount of quality teaching time balanced against maintaining sanitary conditions. Knief said it will be a priority to keep students in the same family on the same schedule.
 Knief expects to ask parents to a respond to a few more surveys, with the final survey asking parents to formally commit to sending their students back to school or providing them with a remote learning opportunity.
 "Right now we're thinking that this kind of model would be some sort of an online learning platform," he said.
 School Committee member Jason Greenwood was concerned about how the district will reach out to parents about the reopening plan. Knief said he hopes to schedule public hearing-type meetings for that purpose.
 Both schools will be required to have isolation rooms for students or staff with possible COVID-19 symptoms that are separate from the nurse's offices but that school nurses can access using the appropriate personal protective equipment.
 Knief said Carver Elementary has the available space and a new state-of-the- art ventilation system, but that's not the case at Carver Middle High School.
 School Committee member James O'Brien said not enough consideration is being given to the difficulties of talking with a mask on all day and he would support face shields as an option. He also worries about how students will catch up academically among the other challenges.
 "There are a lot of people really having a hard time with this," he said.
 One of the recommendations is that students eat in their classrooms. Knief said yes when School Committee Chairman Andy Cardarelli asked about opening windows and holding classes outdoors weather permitting as plausible options.
 Knief said efforts are underway to be able to meet social distancing requirements of at least three feet apart and all students facing forward, including purchasing new desks for kindergarten and first grade rather than sharing tables.
 He said that cost of the new desks and the remote learning platform for students who do not return to school may be covered by new funding announced by Gov. Charlie Baker. He said school districts will receive an additional $225 per pupil. He said that would mean approximately $360,000 for Carver.

Lo scopo è sviluppare l'abilità della nostra mente di accogliere TUTTI i suoni dalla musica che ascoltiamo, senza fare una selezione o un filtro indipendente dalla nostra volontà.
   
 Questo avviene stimolando, semplicemente con ascolti ripetuti, ogni giorno tre differenti filosofie di interpretazione dei suoni che io ho numerato con 1, 2 e 3 e che corrispondono a tre differenti civiltà etnico/musicali (quella africana ed asiatica - 1, quella europea antica - 2 e quella europea moderna - 3).
   
 Quando tutti i filtri culturali vengono rimossi (o equivalentemente quando li padroneggiamo tutti) l'esperienza di ascolto smette di essere un lavoro cosciente che impegna attivamente la nostra mente, ma diventa una esperienza di "flow", di flusso, quella che molti atleti chiamano trance agonistica.
   
 Il beneficio, al di là del maggiore divertimento nell'ascoltare musica, è una sensazione di maggiore attenzione e concentrazione mentale generalizzata per il resto della giornata, paragonabile ad aver bevuto un forte caffè o una bevanda energizzante.
   
 Ovviamente musicisti ed addetti ai lavori potrebbero beneficiarne, ma è rivolto a tutti, grandi e piccini.

There is an understanding within over the type of candidate they desire, far beyond someone who possesses the strongest CV on paper.
 It may frustrate many fans who can see the apparent obvious appointment staring them in the face in Hughton – and there’s nothing to suggest right now that he won’t get the job – but due diligence is taking place that has been permitted at this pace and length by City remaining in the play-off race.
 Talking about who you want for the job and actually giving someone the job is a delicate process, especially for a job as grand and important for Ashton and the Lansdowns as the next manager/head coach of Bristol City.
 To quote Bristol City blogger the Exiled Robin on July 4, "one thing is for certain, with the state of football’s finances, an ever-increasing gap, the expensive, well-paid squad we now have and the investment made into the club in the last ten years, City have NEVER had a more important decision to make with our next manager."

The second crucial advantage Marquez has mastered is the power of consistency. Marquez had earlier admitted that consistency was his weak point, most notably observed in his 2015 title defeat, so it is creditable that he has managed to convert it into a strength. In the upcoming 2020 season, Marquez will be propelled by the opportunity to equalise the legendary Valentino Rossi’s record of seven premier class titles. Given the shortened calendar, Marquez’s consistency will be a bigger strength than ever before. Who can challenge Marquez? Over the years, Marquez’s rivals have worn a changing face. Earlier, it was the old guard comprising stalwarts such as Jorge Lorenzo, Valentino Rossi and Dani Pedrosa, now changed the grid contemporaries are Andrea Dovizioso (Ducati), Maverick Vinales (Yamaha), Alex Rins (Suzuki).

The Chicago Office of the Inspector of General released a report Thursday detailing the night in October when Johnson was found asleep behind the wheel of his police car after consuming "several large servings of rum." The report says Johnson left a downtown restaurant with a member of his security detail after a night of drinking. Johnson has acknowledged he had a "lapse in judgment."

Organizations applying for state funds normally must be compliant with the state’s Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, or GATA. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty some groups may have becoming GATA compliant in time for the July 20 deadline as a result of it, the R3 program has created a process for non-GATA compliant organizations to still get access to grants.
 Groups can apply individually or as a collaborative if multiple organizations are working on the same program. Under R3’s guidelines, only the lead organization listed in a collaborative proposal needs to be GATA compliant for all member groups to receive the grant.
 The R3 program, which was created as part of state legislation legalizing marijuana, invests 25 percent of tax revenue from adult-use cannabis into communities most impacted by mass incarceration and the war on drugs. The program’s first $31.5 million in grant funding comes from a $35-million appropriation from the General Revenue Fund to the ICJIA for the 2021 Fiscal Year.
 Information on how to apply can be found at r3.illinois.gov.
 Since January, Illinois has brought in $52 million from taxes on legalized marijuana sales, according to a Tuesday news release from the governor’s office. By law, a quarter of that income and subsequent cannabis-tax revenue will fund future R3 grants.
 The marijuana legalization bill was also designed to allow social equity applicants who are from the impacted communities to break into ownership of the marijuana industry. That has not happened yet, as new licenses for dispensaries due to be granted on May 1 and craft grow licenses due to be granted on July 1 have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 On Wednesday, Gov. JB Pritzker said he is hopeful movement would be realized “in the next six weeks” — give or take a week or two.
 “No new licenses are given until these social equity licenses are given,” Pritzker said at an unrelated news conference in Chicago. “So we want to make sure that we're getting accomplished as fast as possible the, you know, people of color, having the opportunity to enter this industry to own and to work in this industry.”
 On Tuesday, the governor's office announced that, since January, Illinois residents and visitors have spent nearly $240 million on legalized recreational marijuana, producing $52 million in state revenue.

I sat behind the wheel with one bare foot out the window, wedged next to the side-view mirror. Beyond the windshield, Michael J. Fox could be seen on the big screen, scrambling through 1955, trying to play matchmaker to his parents and get back home to the eighties. Next to me, Valerie sat in the passenger's seat, her fleece draped over her and pulled up to her chin, and watched the movie, which was, of course, Back to the Future.
   
 No, this isn't a memory from the summer of 1985. It couldn't be. I may have been here in Maine back then, but Valerie was down in Massachusetts. I was 13 then, and would have had no business behind the wheel of an automobile. Valerie was 11. We wouldn't meet for another nine years. Nah, Val and I were at the Saco Drive-in, enjoying a free showing of the time-traveling classic.
   
 At one point I looked at the time on the dashboard and also caught the date. "July 9," it said on the screen. I smiled and felt that uplifting feeling you get when everything in the world feels right for a moment. July 9, I thought. Perfect.
   
 There is nothing particularly special about that date. July 9 just felt like the quintessential summer date to me, is all. You could say that about any one of the 31 days of the month.
   
 In October, I take a look at the foliage, breathe in the crisp air, and tell myself that the tenth month of the year is my favorite. I find, though, that I actually need to be in the month to realize that. The rest of the year, I think of July as my favorite. July is the month I look forward to the most.
   
 Summer is a warm and carefree time. Sure, if you're not a kid or a retiree, you have to work, but the pace of life tends to slow down all the same, as you take some vacation time. Of the seasons, summer is the equivalent of a weekend.
   
 June is Friday, when you have all of summer ahead of you, and you are flush with visions of afternoons spent in the shade or at the beach, of getaways to private havens or tourist destinations. June is filled with excitement and anticipation.
   
 August is Sunday, still laidback and with all the opportunities of the season, but also on the cusp of September, a very Monday-like month in which routine and structure resume and life gets busy and back to normal. August is enjoyable, but somewhere, in the back of your mind, you know it is summer's last hurrah.
   
 July is Saturday, largely free from the busyness of June, with its graduations and weddings, and without the sense that the proverbial fat lady is clearing her throat and getting ready to sing in August. July is the sweet spot of summer.
   
 Well, okay, this particular July is a bit of an exception, if you're a town clerk or a journalist or a voter with a candidate to elect or a municipal or school budget to approve. Typically, in this area, communities have their municipal elections and budget votes and the state has its primary in June. Not so this year, what with the pandemic and all. We had our state primary, annual town elections, and school budget validations this week, making the first half of this month busier than usual.
   
 "Well, at least when this is all over, you can relax and enjoy the summer," I told one town clerk last week, as we discussed how busy she was preparing for the primary and everything else.
   
 "For a couple of days," she replied. "Then we have to get ready for November."
   
 Ah. Yes. That.
   
 Maybe you're not a summer person. Perhaps the heat turns you off, and you prefer that crisp air of fall or - shudder at the thought - the cold snap of winter. Or maybe you do love summer, but you're also able to live in the moment and let August be August without caring that the sands of the season are almost done slipping through the hourglass. I salute you - at 48, I'm still working on that mindfulness.
   
 Which makes right now so precious to me. We lost the spring, somehow - the pandemic and its shutdown gave time a strange elasticity, leading us to believe that the season was put on hold, even as it marched on by. That's how it felt to me, anyway, but I've spoken with others who have agreed. Here is July, though, and maybe we've finally caught back up, even as COVID-related restrictions continue. All you need to do to feel like it's summer is head to the lake or the beach.
   
 Or stick your bare foot out the car window at the drive-in and feel the warm night air on your toes.

El homenaje de Estado celebrado ayer en Madrid en memoria de las victimas de la pandemia unio a todo el pais en un sentimiento de emocionada solidaridad. La presencia en el mismo, junto a los Reyes y sus hijas, de representantes institucionales del Gobierno, de los partidos de la oposicion, de las comunidades autonomas, de las instituciones europeas y, sobre todo, de los colectivos que mas directamente tuvieron que hacer frente a la emergencia sanitaria constituyo el simbolo de una sociedad herida que tardara en sacudirse el tremendo impacto que el Covid-19 ha significado y sigue significando en todos los ordenes de la vida nacional. En el Patio de la Armeria del Palacio Real estuvieron desde los familiares de las victimas hasta los sanitarios que contuvieron en los primeros momentos el tremendo impacto de muerte y desolacion que trajo la enfermedad. Desde los militares y fuerzas de seguridad que jugaron un papel decisivo en las calles y en las residencias de mayores hasta las cajeras y trabajadores de supermercado que permitieron un confinamiento de la poblacion con las despensas surtidas. Y junto a todos ellos, los politicos que seguramente ayer comprendieron que las esteriles polemicas en las que han estado envueltos durante estos meses y los intentos de utilizacion de la situacion para sus intereses partidistas estaban muy alejados de los verdaderos sentimientos de los españoles durante estos duros meses. "Hemos contraido la obligacion moral y el deber civico de recordar la dignidad de los fallecidos", dijo el Rey durante su intervencion en el acto. Obligacion moral y deber civico son dos conceptos que resumen de forma certera como se deben afrontar los compromisos que hemos adquirido ante la tremenda desgracia soportada. Tambien seria muy necesario que el sentimiento de homenaje a las victimas se traduzca por parte de la poblacion en un respeto escrupuloso de las normas sanitarias que impidan los rebrotes que se estan produciendo y por parte de los responsables gubernamentales en un trabajo riguroso que evite disfunciones en la atencion sanitaria y que corrija deficiencias tan lamentables como no saber a estas alturas, con datos fehacientes, el numero real de muertos por la pandemia.
