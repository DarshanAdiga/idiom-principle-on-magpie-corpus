This year, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic’s decimation of our tolerance for corporate whimsy, we won’t have to endure Google’s latest prank, as the company has announced that it’s sitting out April Fools’ Day. If the dearth of relevant PR pitches in my inbox right now is any indication, most of the other serial April Fools’ offenders are planning to follow suit. There will certainly be a few companies that _do_ proceed as if this were a normal April, and they will deserve all the scorn you can stand to send their way. With luck, the coronavirus will kill the corporate April Fools’ prank for good.

The coronavirus has left colleges across the country fretting what the impact might mean for their schools, with a slew of surveys by various industry groups trying to gauge high-school seniors' plans for the next year. Most surveys have found somewhere around 20% of students are reconsidering whether to attend college in the fall, specifically due to coronavirus, and fewer are feeling confident about being able to pay for college. Some students said they planned on going to school close to home due to the virus.

Starting a spirit brand is no easy task, especially for a black woman with no prior background within the spirit industry. But Nayana Ferguson's lack of experience didn’t stop her from launching Teeq Tequila, a premium tequila based in Detroit with her husband Don Ferguson and Co-founder Mike Rowold in August 2018. Using her previous knowledge as a businesswoman, Ferguson turned her passion for tequila into a thriving business, thus becoming the only black woman to operate a tequila brand. Although it’s a small brand with just three tequilas in its portfolio including the world’s only coconut lime Blanco tequila, Teeq Tequila is garnering attention from the Spirit Industry. This year at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, this brand received silver and bronze medals for all three of their tequila expressions. In an interview with Forbes, Ferguson explains Teeq Tequila’s origin and how this brand was able to expand in such a short period.

To stop the spread of the virus and prevent death, Crozier said they must take a methodical approach, move the majority of the sailors off the ship, isolate them and completely clean it. He said about 10% of the crew would have to stay on board to secure the vessel, run critical systems and sanitize everything. Aquilino declined to confirm that estimate but said he is working with commanders to get people quarantined and tested as quickly as possible.

Agassi also became the ninth player in the Open Era (since 1968) to record 700 career singles matches wins, joining Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, Guillermo Vilas, John McEnroe, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras, Ilie Nastase and Boris Becker.


  Agassi collected a 13th Tennis Masters Series title and his second tournament victory of 2002 after his win in Scottsdale earlier this month.


  Federer, 20, slipped to 23-6 on the ATP Tour this year but he still is the leader in match victories on the circuit. He opened the year by winning the Sydney title, reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and was runner- up in Milan.


  Agassi, who became the first opponent here to break Federer's serve as he took the opening two sets, saw Federer raise his level in third, when the Swiss surrendered just three points on his serve.


  Federer grabbed the early break in the fourth to lead 2-1 before Agassi turned his game up a notch. "Down a break early in the fourth, I just wanted to hang on and make him serve it out," Agassi said. "Who knows if something good could happen."


  Agassi clawed his way back with a break in the eighth game to tie the set at 4-4, making a superb return to the baseline that Federer could only slap into the net.


  "Once I got that break, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "I felt like, 'OK, now I can just take care of my serve and maybe play a great game and get the win. That's exactly what happened," said Agassi.

There’s an important caveat, though: While this is a really good time to borrow money for infrastructure spending, it’s not a great moment to actually build infrastructure. First, we’re in the middle of a pandemic. We don’t want to encourage nonessential workers to go out and spread the coronavirus. Second, infrastructure spending wouldn’t do _that_ much to help the economy and create jobs right now, at least compared to during a normal downturn. One reason why infrastructure typically makes for good fiscal stimulus is that it has a _multiplier_ effect. You pay some crews to fix up a road, which gives them work, and then they go and spend their paychecks and the cash makes its way through the economy, perking up growth. Right now, you wouldn’t get much of a multiplier effect, because we’ve literally ordered large parts of the economy to shut down and outlawed going to work. If you pay a crew to fix up a road right now, they’ll probably just go home afterward and not spend much of it.

RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT)- Major League Baseball is extending its financial support to minor league players through May while suspending their contracts because of the coronavirus pandemic.MLB announced March 19 that it was giving minor leaguers $400 weekly allowances through April 8, the day before the minor league season was scheduled to start. The commissioner's office said Tuesday that minor leaguers will continue to receive those allowances and health benefits through May 31 or the minor league opening day, whichever comes first.Major and minor league seasons are on hold due to the coronavirus. Weekly minimum salaries on full-season minor league teams range from $290 at Class A to $502 at Triple-A over the five-month season, meaning many players are making more during this hiatus than they do during the season.The allowances are meant to help players cover costs for housing, food and training. Most players were instructed to leave their spring training complexes just over two weeks ago, sending them scrambling to make ends meet because they hadn't received a paycheck from teams since the end of the 2019 season.This will benefit past and future Flying Squirrels as well. While minor leaguers await their official assignments for 2020, they'll be able to breathe a little easier with the latest announcement of help."No matter you slice it, all of this helps the players in some way," said Squirrels' COO Todd "Parney" Parnell on Tuesday. "In this time of unknown and a lot of negativity, this is a little sliver of positivity that's going into our players and I'm glad for them."The Flying Squirrels have also remained an active part of the community during the pandemic. Parney and his staff have been making calls to fans and supporters, Nutzy and Nutasha have been visiting Richmond Public School students at meal distribution, and the team has been active on social media.“It’s amazing to me how much a text can mean to people,” said Parney. “It’s amazing to me how much a hand-written note can mean to people, it’s amazing to me how just telling somebody that you care can mean to people right now, so we’re focusing on that.”Copyright 2020 WWBT.
