To cite a single instance, the Davis Group’s “Gimme Some Lovin’” was later covered by such stylistically disparate artists as the Blues Brothers and Olivia Newton-John. And while his name may no longer strike the same chord of recognition, Davis has contributed significantly to the lexicon of rock music.


  Now, after eight years of working behind the scenes as a record company executive, the accomplished singer-songwriter is poised to make a comeback. “Crossfire,” his first album in more than a decade, is scheduled for release this week on the independent Allegiance label, where Davis also heads the Artist and Repertoire (A&R) department.


  “I’ve stayed true to my roots, but the musicians I work with have helped me bring my work up to date,” said the Welsh-born musician in a phone interview from his Los Angeles office yesterday. “I would hate to be regarded as some sort of dinosaur.


  “The title of the album is really a double-entendre because I should be in a crossfire when people call the record company and ask to speak to the head of the A&R department, and that’s me.”

DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors plans to spend $2 billion to convert its Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plant into a third U.S. site to build electric vehicles. The Detroit automaker also says it will spend another $153 million to upgrade five Michigan factories for future vehicles. The company will build the Cadillac Lyriq, a small electric SUV, at the Spring Hill factory. GM said Tuesday that gasoline-powered Cadillac SUVs will continue to be built at the plant, and it will also get additional unspecified electric vehicles. The Lyriq is due in showrooms late in 2022. The investments aren't expected to create any new jobs, but will help keep existing ones.

Scott Aylmer Teekell A private memorial service honoring the life of Scott Aylmer Teekell will be held at 2 p.m., Thursday, October 22, 2020 at First Methodist Church with the Rev. Pat Day officiating. Scott was born on October 22, 1954, as the third son of Mr. and Mrs. Byrum W. Teekell. He died suddenly on Friday, October 16, 2020 in Shreveport. He is survived by his parents; his loving wife Patricia Rachal Teekell; sons Walker Teekell of Denver, Colorado, Spencer Teekell and Dylan Teekell of Shreveport; brothers J. Gray Teekell (Mary) of Shreveport; Andrew Teekell (Catherine) of Austin, Texas, and Hassell Teekell (Suzy) of Shreveport; and his aunt Kaz Teekell of Anchorage, Alaska. He will be deeply missed by his grandsons Kaedyn and Chayson Teekell of Shreveport and nephew Andrew Shane Teekell of Austin, nieces Anna Teekell Hays of Newport News, VA, Laura Gray Teekell McCann of Memphis, TN, and Chelsea Payne of Baton Rouge, LA, and his four Alaskan cousins Kerry, Donna, Diane and Ronnie Teekell. Scott was a graduate of Captain Shreve High School and attended Louisiana Tech. He worked for many years and places in the restaurant industry from Pizza Hut, to owning Monsour's in Shreveport and the Cactus Café in Telluride, Colorado. Returning to Shreveport, he joined the family insurance business, The Teekell Company, where he was a partner with his father and brother. He was a Chartered Life Underwriter and a member of the M Financial Group of Portland, Oregon. His often outrageous ways tended to hide his softer side and huge heart. He was quick-witted, supportive, motivating and full of unconditional love. "The extraordinary heart he carried was a masterpiece." His love of laughter was exceeded only by his love of his family and friends. He was a man of many talents and interests - skiing, duck hunting, golf, dogs and music. He loved good food and drink - meat and potatoes, but never vegetables or cheese. He was a great cook, even of the things he would not eat. Scott Crane, Stafford Comegys, Robert LaBorde and Roy Rachal, as honorary pallbearers, will represent the host of friends who loved him and enjoyed his company. An outdoor reception will be held from 6 until 8 p.m. at the El Karubah Shrine, 6230 South Lakeshore Drive. "Back at ya!" Memorials may be made to the charity of the donor's choice.

Davis then began working with Muff Winwood at Island Records, where they played key roles in launching the careers of Bob Marley, Robert Palmer and newly minted solo artist Steve Winwood. In 1984, the then 44-year-old Davis released his first new album in more than a decade, “Crossfire,” and joked in a Union-Tribune interview: “I coined the phrase ‘cardiopulmonary rock’!”


  “Crossfire” was released by the independent Allegiance label, where Davis at the time also headed the label’s Artist and Repertoire (A&R) department. His subsequent tour to promote the album included a show at the Belly Up in Solana Beach.


  Davis stepped out of the spotlight soon after, but by 2006 began touring again with a rotating lineup of musicians as the Spencer Davis Group, with German-based drummer York sometimes on board.


  “Someone at Capitol Records once said to me, ‘Spencer, you’re too old to rock and roll’,” an incredulous Davis said in his 1984 Union-Tribune interview. “That was one of the most tactless things I’ve ever heard. Is Willie Dixon too old to sing and play his bass? You only stop doing it when you’re lying in your coffin. I keep on running, and always will.”

Unleash your stress, anger, sadness, whatever you're feeling and it'll make you feel better.

I have raised seven children. (I still have a few I am actively parenting.) My parenting experience spans three decades. I am now a grandmother.


  Through the course of raising seven, beautiful, different and normal children, I have learned a thing or two. Although my career as an early childhood specialist and educator has prepared me for so much of my life as a parent, the majority of what I have learned is from experience.


  Experience is the best teacher.


  I often hear this from others: “How do you do it?” “I could never do what you do.” “You must be so


  busy.” “Don’t they drive you nuts?”


  Many of these comments and questions are normal responses to someone who decides to populate the world, adopt a few and live large. I am a normal person. I am no different than anyone else. I just found the kryptonite of parenting.


  It took me a few years. It is still a work in progress because sometimes my kryptonite goes to sleep and needs to be recharged.


  I hear Superman did the same thing from time to time. For example, I cursed when I found out my two freshmen hadn’t been handing in any virtual homework. It was a colorful moment. I am sure it matched the lyrics in some of the songs they listen to, but I felt justified.


  Wonder Woman got angry too. So, I preface this by saying this superpower won’t always be perfect but it can be perfected.


  The two superpowers that you have that can change the trajectory of your parenting journey


  are redirection and a soft voice.


  Yep. That is it. You can always change the course by using these two superpowers.


  It is good from birth to adult. It is valuable in the home, in public at the store and in the classroom.


  There is a catch, though. You must work on your own self-regulation to be able to use these to their fullest. You must be able to control your emotional responses, as the adult.


  You cannot react to whatever is going on. You cannot match the actor or the situation. The actor is your child. The situation


  is the chaos or the behaviors.


  You see, if you respond to the actor, mirror neurons will kick in and that


  actor will match your energy.


  Have you ever wondered why an infant cries when you are trying to get out the door or if you are having a hard day? They are mirroring you. If you spin out of control when a 2-year-old is tired and spills their milk, welcome to World War III. The reason I know the superpowers work is because I have used them daily for a long time.


  As my children have grown up, the superpowers look differently than when they were younger. For instance, when my son wants to talk politics and I know he is just wanting to get me worked up.


  I simply use a voice that is soft, unagitated and mention something that will get the conversation on to something different, quickly.


  I simply say, “When do you think sports will start? What are you excited about when school gets back in session?”


  This is a brain hook or a redirection tactic I use.


  If you are dealing with a preschooler who is tired and spilled milk, I would not respond to the spilled milk (self-regulation). I would say in a soft voice, “I am sorry, buddy. Let’s read a book” (redirection). It would be my hope that my calm and soft voice would then allow my child to match my energy (mirror neurons).


  Many times I got into the whirlwind of disciplining the issues such as spilling or being sassy. When I tapped into my superpowers, my days changed. My children were happier. My classrooms were managed. I was better.


  Tapping into these superpowers will have you feeling better physically, mentally and emotionally. When you become self-regulated, hard things are easier.


  Parenting is the hardest job. Claim your superpower as a superhero. Finding a little kryptonite will


  definitely elevate your game.

Scott Aylmer Teekell      A private memorial service honoring the life of Scott Aylmer Teekell will be held at 2 p.m., Thursday, October 22, 2020 at First Methodist Church with the Rev. Pat Day officiating.      Scott was born on October 22, 1954, as the third son of Mr. and Mrs. Byrum W. Teekell. He died suddenly on Friday, October 16, 2020 in Shreveport. He is survived by his parents; his loving wife Patricia Rachal Teekell; sons Walker Teekell of Denver, Colorado, Spencer Teekell and Dylan Teekell of Shreveport; brothers J. Gray Teekell (Mary) of Shreveport; Andrew Teekell (Catherine) of Austin, Texas, and Hassell Teekell (Suzy) of Shreveport; and his aunt Kaz Teekell of Anchorage, Alaska.      He will be deeply missed by his grandsons Kaedyn and Chayson Teekell of Shreveport and nephew Andrew Shane Teekell of Austin, nieces Anna Teekell Hays of Newport News, VA, Laura Gray Teekell McCann of Memphis, TN, and Chelsea Payne of Baton Rouge, LA, and his four Alaskan cousins Kerry, Donna, Diane and Ronnie Teekell.      Scott was a graduate of Captain Shreve High School and attended Louisiana Tech. He worked for many years and places in the restaurant industry from Pizza Hut, to owning Monsour's in Shreveport and the Cactus Café in Telluride, Colorado. Returning to Shreveport, he joined the family insurance business, The Teekell Company, where he was a partner with his father and brother. He was a Chartered Life Underwriter and a member of the M Financial Group of Portland, Oregon.      His often outrageous ways tended to hide his softer side and huge heart. He was quick-witted, supportive, motivating and full of unconditional love. "The extraordinary heart he carried was a masterpiece." His love of laughter was exceeded only by his love of his family and friends. He was a man of many talents and interests - skiing, duck hunting, golf, dogs and music. He loved good food and drink - meat and potatoes, but never vegetables or cheese. He was a great cook, even of the things he would not eat.      Scott Crane, Stafford Comegys, Robert LaBorde and Roy Rachal, as honorary pallbearers, will represent the host of friends who loved him and enjoyed his company. An outdoor reception will be held from 6 until 8 p.m. at the El Karubah Shrine, 6230 South Lakeshore Drive. "Back at ya!"      Memorials may be made to the charity of the donor's choice.

Things were slipping away from Stetson Bennett and Georgia on Saturday night.


   


  The Bulldogs starting quarterback had just thrown his third interception of the game against Alabama, this one the most inexplicable after being chased to the right and throwing back across the middle with no receiver nearby.


   


  Coach Kirby Smart talked to Bennett on the sideline after the play and then patted him on the midsection three times. In the final minute of the 41-24 loss, offensive guard Justin Shaffer had his arm around Bennett as he offered encouraging words.


   


  Bennett's interceptions Saturday, along with five passes that were batted down, came in a game in which Georgia was shutout in the second half, prompting many to wonder if the Bulldogs can win a rematch with Alabama in the SEC title game and be a legitimate playoff contender with the 5-foot-11 former walk-on at the position.


   


  If a change were to be made, this open date before playing at Kentucky Oct. 31 would be a prime opportunity. Smart didn't say definitively when asked Tuesday if Bennett would remain the starter, but also didn't indicate a change was in the works.


   


  "Like I've talked about before. I feel great about Stetson," Smart said. "He's done a good job managing the situations we've put him in. He made a couple of bad decisions."


   


  Coaches will certainly get a chance this week to look more at the other quarterbacks--Southern Cal transfer JT Daniels, redshirt sophomore D'Wan Mathis and true freshman Carson Beck.


   


  "This week, we'll get to get a lot of guys reps," Smart said. "JT will get reps, D'Wan will get reps, Stetson will continue to get reps. We try to develop our roster is the way we look at it. It doesn't change, it just gives us a chance to give more guys work and see where they are in their progress and that's true at every position, including quarterback."


   


  The timing this week comes as No. 4 Georgia (3-1) is coming off its first loss of the season and the feel-good story of Bennett is met with hard questions being asked about if he's the answer long-term this season.


   


  "I'm saying right now that Georgia has major question marks at the quarterback position," former Alabama quarterback Greg McElory, now an ESPN analyst, said on air Saturday night. "In 2020, I am genuinely concerned about teams that have question marks at that spot, moreso than maybe any other year because of the teams you're playing against, they all have firepower."


   


  If Georgia gets to the SEC championship game, it will almost certainly play an Alabama team that has a Heisman Trophy candidate in Mac Jones at quarterback. Other national title contenders also have difference makers at the position in Clemson's Trevor Lawrence and Ohio State's Justin Fields, who Smart landed at Georgia but who transferred after one season backing up Jake Fromm. The Bulldogs will also go against a Florida team with Kyle Trask who leads the SEC with 14 touchdown passes.


   


  Bennett was told in the preseason that the Georgia coaches didn't see him as their starting quarterback.


   


  The opt-out of Wake Forest graduate transfer Jamie Newman, the presumed starter, eventually led to Mathis, a former four-star recruit, starting against Arkansas when Southern Cal transfer JT Daniels, a five-star recruit, wasn't yet cleared medically to play coming off ACL surgery.


   


  Bennett rallied Georgia to a win in the opener after Mathis was pulled and won a pair of home games against top 15 Auburn and Tennessee. Daniels warmed up Saturday at Alabama without a brace on his surgically repaired knee. He underwent ACL surgery after being lost for the season in the 2019 Trojan opener and had a follow-up procedure by January.


   


  "I think Stetson probably feels he needs to be playing close to perfect because he's got these other fantastic quarterbacks right there itching to play and maybe fit the profile a little bit better than Stetson. Who knows?" Sean Pender, who coached Bennett at Pierce County, said prior to Bennett's second Georgia start against Tennessee. "The leader of that team has to have the intangibles to lead and I know Stetson has those intangibles."


   


  Daniels got the green light by the medical staff to play in games in week two, but he hasn't seen any action yet.


   


  "Everything else is revolved around who we think gives us the best chance to win," Smart said. "That's ultimately the decision we have."


   


  Bennett managed to avoid any interceptions in the first three games but it showed up against Alabama. Bennett was particularly perturbed with his final one and knew what he did wrong.


   


  "Don't throw it across my body, which I've known since I was four years old," Bennett said.


   


  His other in the second half came with Georgia at the Alabama 25. The pass to Jermaine Burton on a throw over the middle went off Burton's hands but was too high.


   


  "That one's on the quarterback," CBS analyst Gary Danielson said on air.


   


  "Sometimes you get batted balls and they get tipped and they get picked," Smart said. "Sometimes you throw a ball, you miss Jermaine a little bit over the middle there, it's a little bit out of his reach, maybe Jermaine gets his hands on it more, it's just unfortunate they picked it. The ones that don't get picked concern me more when we throw into coverage and we had a couple of those."


   


  Pender said Bennett has a "gunslinger's mentality" who will make mistakes.


   


  Georgia led 24-20 with under five minutes to go in the third quarter but its second half drives ended like this: punt, punt, interception, interception, missed field goal.


   


  Bennett, who completed 18 of 40 passes against Alabama, is eighth in the SEC in passing efficiency (135.9) and sixth in yards per attempt (7.73). He connected with James Cook on an 82-yard touchdown, the longest pass play for Georgia since 2013.


   


  "He's done a really good job of executing on third down," Smart said. "He hit some guys that have dropped some balls on third down. We've become a third down team since he's been in there. We've got to continue to improve on that. Everybody around him has to continue to improve."

Davis readily acknowledged that his dual position with Allegiance could be construed as a conflict of interest, but he is pragmatic when answering such charges.


  “I get to hear a new band whenever I play a concert, and I don’t think that most A&R people can say that,” he opined. “Many years ago, I resolved never to be out of work.”


  A former teacher with degrees in history, comparative philosophy and linguistics (he is fluent in German, French and Spanish, and conversant in Dutch and several Scandinavian languages), Davis has resided in Los Angeles for the last 13 years. He began performing in a Dixieland jazz group while attending university in Birmingham, England.


  “We played Bunk Johnson and George Lewis material,” he recalled, “and through them, I discovered Leadbelly. I had also been listening to all the black American blues artists: Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and Blind Lemon Jefferson, as well as folk singers like Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie. I was very much into that, as were most of my contemporaries.”

This stance is supported by research from the University of Cambridge that found the use of body worn cameras improves the behaviour of the wearer and those in its vicinity, as both are aware of the fact it can act as an objective 'digital witness' to the situation.

New York City public schools, with over 1.1 million children, have reported only 18 new cases of Covid-19 in the first three weeks of partial re-openings. The 7-day average test positivity rate  for Covid-19 in New York City as of October 17, 2020 was 1.6%. While standardization for identifying and tracing new Covid-19 cases continues to be a work in progress, this model, on a more local but much larger scale than day care openings, seems to be following a similar pattern of case rate commensurate with community spread. As the Fall 2020 is already leading to spikes of cases throughout most of the country, spikes in schools and child care facilities may follow suit.

Inaugurated in 2012, the government of West Bengal had taken an initiative to build a Cultural & Research Institute to commemorate the birth anniversary of Bengal's polymath, known as the Bard of Bengal, globally. Spread over an area of 4.89 acres, the institute is in the heart of New Town with facilities including an auditorium, art gallery, exhibition hall, mini cinema hall and music room. Every year, thousands of guest tour exhibits, attend cultural programmes, enjoy movies, and view artifacts. Incident management While the Cultural & Research Institute had delegated personnel to keep a watch on the premises, manning the expansive property proved to be time-consuming and inefficient. For security team, round-the-clock security preparedness at the location was crucial and ensuring the safety and security of the guests was quite a challenge. The management wanted to build a unified solution, aiming to not only deliver 24x7 surveillance but also empower the on-ground team to manage incidents proactively. Specially, they were facing the conflicting dilemma of keeping priceless objects safe yet allowing millions of visitors a chance to see them. Intelligent VMS After analysing the requirements, the Videonetics team conducted a detailed survey of the property along with the system integrator for the project, Prakash Electricals, to draw out a comprehensive plan for the campus. The state-of-the-art Videonetics unified solution combining Intelligent VMS and Intelligent Video Analytics coupled with IP cameras were chosen to address the unique needs of specific areas. Videonetics Intelligent VMS helps in recording and viewing 25+ cameras throughout the property including gated entrance, open-air pavilion, fountain park, art gallery, auditorium, passages, server room to name a few. The institute wanted a video analytics solution that could help with protecting valuable artifacts in the art gallery. The art gallery is secured with a virtual and invisible protective barrier called Artifact Protection. If an individual breaches this perimeter, in an attempt to touch or steal an artwork/paintings, an alarm is triggered and immediately received both in the centralised location as well as by the security personnel on their mobile devices, allowing them to react and take action quickly. During the survey, some of the vulnerable areas were identified where Videonetics deployed Zone Monitoring as part of the unified solution. The zone monitoring was required at the entrance, operators' room, art gallery, park space, to detect when a person stays beyond a certain duration in a user-marked zone. Monitored facility The Cultural & Research Institute has been very successful in promoting an open and secured environment where guests and staff could move freely throughout the premises while keeping an eye on strategic locations and limiting access to more sensitive areas such as management offices, cash handling office and crossing barrier near to precious artifacts. Today, incidents are rare at the institute; but if something happens, the team is ready. The security team is alerted in real-time to any irregularities within the site, including tampering with the exhibits and entry into the restricted access zones. From the start of the tour, visitors become aware that they are in a secured and monitored facility.  "As we looked to address a variety of surveillance challenges, we were assured to have Videonetics on board to exceed customer's expectations, in terms of intuitive functionalities, open architecture and accuracy. With Videonetics team, we have successfully provided a right balance between securing the people and protecting assets, to the institute," expressed, Ujjwal Kumar Dey, Partner, Prakash Electricals.

For 25 weeks you must pull out two envelopes a week at random and put inside the amount of cash written on the front.


  So for example if you pull out £5 and £38, you must place the corresponding amount inside. But there is a downside to this, as if you pull number like £98 and £99 in the same week then you must be able to afford to put away £197 in one go.


  However, by the end of the six months if you've followed the process to the letter, ahem, then you could be looking at pocketing £5,050 to help with that deposit on a house, car, or designer handbag you've had your eye on.
