I am a teenager. I am prodigal son, gambling frequently with buddies from school, and frittering away what little pocket-money I had at their houses on weekends.

Learned Mahjong from my mum at an early age - played a few times with aunts and cousins, but mostly with her - it became a Christmas tradition after I moved away to go to Uni. We'd take two hands each (as the ruleset limits what's allowed for two-player games), playing each of our hands independently, with a slightly modified version of Hong Kong rules (my grandad picked it up at Oxford, iirc; no idea how much our family changed the rules since then) that focuses even more on big scores - single suit hands only (mixed hands were technically allowed, but considered impolite, and a waste of everyone's time), about 20 different special hands that I always need to double check… It results in dead hands (no winner before we run out of wall) being far more common, but it gives people time to accumulate really beautiful hands.

Afghan women's rights activist Freshta Kohistani was assassinated on Thursday by unknown gunmen in northern Kapisa province.
 "Unknown gunmen on a motorbike assassinated Freshta Kohistani in Kohistan district of Kapisa province," interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian told reporters, adding that Kohistani's brother was wounded in the attack.
 Kohistani, a former provincial council member, led protests and raised awareness on social media about violence against women in Afghanistan. She had also campaigned for veteran leader Abdullah Abdullah during last year's presidential election, and organized a number of civil society events in Kabul demanding rights for women.
 Abdullah, said Kohistani, 29, was killed in a "terrorist attack". In a Facebook post, he described Kohistani as a "brave and fearless" activist who was at the forefront of civil and social life in Afghanistan.
 "The continuation of such assassinations is unacceptable," said Abdullah.
 No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday's attack.
 ## Afghanistan 'is not a place to live in'
 Kohistani was the second activist to be killed in two days after a pro- democracy advocate was assassinated in the capital on Wednesday.
 Their murders follow a similar pattern seen in recent weeks, in which prominent Afghans have died in targeted killings  in broad daylight, several of them in Kabul.
 Mohammad Yousuf Rasheed, the head of an independent election monitoring organization, was shot and killed in an ambush in Kabul. Several days prior, motorcycle-riding gunmen used a silenced pistol to kill prominent journalist Rahmatullah Nekzad. The reporter had been walking to his neighbourhood mosque.
 The string of assassinations  come as the Afghan government and the Taliban have been  holding peace talks  for more than three months.
 The talks, which aim to end decades of war, have been suspended until early January. There is speculation the resumption could be further delayed.
 Days before her death, Kohistani wrote on Facebook that she had asked for protection from the authorities after receiving threats.
 She had also denounced the country's ongoing wave of assassinations of journalists and activists.
 "Afghanistan is not a place to live in. There is no hope for peace. Tell the tailor to take your measurement (for a funeral shroud), tomorrow it could be your turn," she tweeted in November.

When I play games, as the absolute content-hound I am, I naturally seek out screenshotable moments. Those lines of dialogue you can send to a friend and say "haha that's something you'd say", or a beautiful bit of landscape, as well as everything in between. Well, Hades is absolutely stuffed with those moments. From the flirtatious chats with Meg to Achilles' entertaining glossary in the Codex, to the hand-draw vista looking out on to the plains of Elysium, save a bit of disk space. You'll be hitting that PRT SCR button pretty often.

The night before, we had heard about her past, about struggling through difficult jobs and difficult times, working multiple jobs with small children, and raising ten (TEN!) children. These days, she is supported by children and grandchildren who are, by and large, wealthy professionals. She lives with all her worldly cares taken care of. Nevertheless, a lifestyle of earnest endeavour means she can never sit still. She sends away any maid we ever hire. She still wakes at daybreak, and cooks and bakes, mends and makes, scrimps and saves, continuing a lifestyle of frugality, and eschewing extravagance.

It is in this way that Supergiant have managed to make us all worshippers of the Ancient Greek gods once more, in a way that I imagine people actually were in the past. Because we're all like "Yes, thank you Artemis, give me that sweet crit stacking damage!" but equally, because runs can make or break on a single roll of the infernal dice, we are just as much hoping to _not_ run into certain gods. "Please, _please_ no Dionysus or - oh fucking hell, it's Zeus, ugh." Can't tell me someone in Ancient Athens never said basically that exact sentence before. Time is a circle.

The way the narrative expands over several runs is something I haven't seen before either, and it's extremely impressive how every single line of dialogue (all excellently voiced, too) feels relevant to your current situation. I still haven't heard a chat repeated, and even though you have to complete several runs to get the 'full' story, it doesn't feel like a chore thanks to the sweet variety of weapons to choose from, as well as the options to up the ante and make things tougher on yourself.

By contrast, my grandmother’s rules are sparse and simple. The only special hand is _peng hú_ , which hearkens even further back in time to a predecessor of the game. Scores are counted on one hand, and there’s a lot more give and take. You can win money even when you lose the game, if your cards are good. But luck also counts for a lot. Ultimately, the person who wins the most consistently will walk home with a profit.

Everything in the game is balanced, and as the turn moves around, as the winds rotate, everyone and everything moves with a give and take. My turns impact you, which impact your neighbour. There are times when the cards flow, and times when nothing comes to you at all. There is a delicate dance, a circular balance of yin and yang around the table.

Dear Editor,
 As the worldwide pandemic continues to influence our lives, it has left many issues unresolved. At the beginning of this school year, I, like many students, was confused about how everyone was going back to school. While I believe that our school has done a good job taking COVID-19 seriously and handling this chaotic year, there is a topic I found concerning: a lack of urgency around COVID-19 within our community. Not everyone is worried about the effect this pandemic has on others. Lack of concern around COVID-19 is hazardous for schools and will have severe consequences if urgency is not emphasized; thus, due to this lack of urgency and its potential havoc on students, I believe schools should go virtual for the time being.

Meanwhile, the nation continues to reel as the coronavirus spreads, with record infections and hospitalizations and more than 327,000 now dead. And millions are now facing the prospect of spending the holidays alone or struggling to make ends meet without adequate income, food or shelter thanks to the pandemic's economic toll.

But Mahjong is a game, and games are powerful. Games have this power to bring people together. To transcend nations and borders, countries and tribes, families and language. Play games with your children, and one day you might play with your children’s children, and it will be glorious.
