Notably, though, "On the Record" grants an extensive hearing to Dixon's talents and contributions to hip-hop from its earliest days, capturing her light up as she remembers befriending the Notorious B.I.G. and playing a part in bringing together Mary J. Blige and Method Man for the now-classic 1994 duet "I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By." This makes "On the Record" something more than a chronicle of one woman's experience in taking her personal pain public - it is proof of Dixon's instrumental role in shaping parts of modern hip-hop, a celebration of the music and the culture that poses the difficult question whether the people who love the culture are willing to come to terms with the alleged misconduct and crimes its heroes may have committed.

That post produced sharp retorts from Osterman and several other players as well as a Facebook repudiation of the tweet, which subsequently was deleted but archived by several Twitter users, by USSSA Pride.      "We have all said we are walking away from Scrap Yard and will not wear Scrap Yard uniforms," Osterman said Tuesday morning. "For now, we're 15 or 16 girls and coaches who don't have an organization.      "Now we have to decide if we want to continue playing and what that would look like."      She said that she and other Scrap Yard players expressed their displeasure after the game to Connie May, Scrap Yard's general manager, who was the author of the tweet.      "The GM tried to defend her tweet by saying it came from a good place in her heart and that she was proud of us taking the field and being able to unite, so to speak," Osterman said.      "This team is very united. We were proud to take the field, and it would have been a platform for showing that sports can continue. However, it was hijacked by being political.      "When we asked (May) what she was thinking, she replied, 'Obviously I didn't think enough.'"      Compounding the tone-deaf nature of the tweet, Osterman said, is the fact that one of Scrap Yard's veteran players, Kiki Stokes, is black.      "When you make that kind of statement on behalf of the organization, knowing that (Stokes), who has been the face of your organization for five years, is a black athlete, that is just ignorant, and we won't stand for it."      Stokes, an outfielder and catcher, said on Twitter that she was "betrayed, embarrassed, disgusted, angry" by May's actions.      "To come into that locker room after a game and have no idea that the organization I stayed loyal to for the last 5 years and put my honest to God heart and soul into wasn't looking out for me but more importantly my community hurts," she wrote.      Osterman, the former University of Texas standout who at 37 has been named to the 2021 Olympic team after coming out of retirement, is one of several Olympic team members who were playing for Scrap Yard Fast Pitch.      The team was scheduled to play seven games in Florida and a dozen games later this summer at the Dawgs' home field near The Woodlands, but Osterman said those plans are now in question after May's tweet.      Tuesday was a scheduled off day, and Osterman said players planned to meet during the afternoon to decide how to proceed.      "We were used as pawns in somebody else's political agenda, and that is not what you want when you put your trust in an organization," Osterman said. "You don't see NFL teams, NBA teams, MLB Teams, NHL, WNBA, posting their political agenda with their entire team tagged in it.      "People want to say you don't support standing for the anthem. It's not about the anthem and it's not about the flag. It's about not being cognizant of the fact that you are making 17 people part of your statement, and now the entire team and coaching staff have all stepped down."      Olympian Monica Abbott was among several other players who joined Osterman in repudiating May's use of the photo in a manner they said did not represent the feelings of players.

Sunny borders with bold, bright blooms catch the attention of everyone but if you have a garden with shade, do not worry; these areas can be lovely, too. There are perennials that boast exotic flowers and others with pretty leaf color. A shade garden can be cool and inviting and is a pleasant place to garden on hot summer days. The good news is that there are plenty of plants that can tolerate or even prefer a shaded position.      Some of my favorite perennials for the shaded area have beautiful flowers and others I grow for the stunning foliage. Both have great qualities and when choosing plants for this situation, you need to think about different textures and foliage color. You do not want to choose plants that all have dark green foliage. Add a splash of cream, golden or white foliage to make the garden come alive.      If you want something new, Wild Swan, a Japanese anemone, produces masses of white flowers with attractive lavender-blue bands on the reverse of the petals. One outstanding feature is it flowers over a long time, blooming continuously from early to late summer. It typically grows 16 to 24 inches and makes a clump almost as wide. The flowers are gracefully carried on wiry stems above the deeply divided, dark green foliage. I have grown several other Japanese anemones such as Honorine Jobert and Whirlwind for years but they do not bloom until fall. Wild Swan blooms in the summer and over a longer period of time.      Hardy begonia is a must for a long period of either white or pink blooms. The flowers stand up above the interesting foliage and add lovely color. I have some growing in damp places as well as drier areas. If it is happy, it will seed about and give you a real show. It comes up later than other plants so do not disturb the ground in early spring or you will lose these lovely, charming plants.      If you live in zone 7 or cooler, hardy geranium Rozanne is a top choice for color. I have it planted along a border and it blooms all summer sporting lovely violet-blue flowers. Do not get this confused with a plant that is also named geranium that is an annual. The annual geranium is quite different from the hardy geranium Rozanne.      Hostas are at the top of the list of most shade gardeners. The array of textures, shapes and sizes of hostas are amazing. You can find some hostas that are quite large and others that are tiny. Two large ones that come to mind are Empress Wu and Sun and Substance. A true focal point for any shade garden, these giant forms are very impressive. Empress Wu can grow 4 feet tall and 7 or 8 feet wide with leaves well over 15 inches wide. Some of the small hosta plants do not get over 5 inches tall with leaves an inch wide. They do flower and can be dramatic while others are quite fragrant.      Brunnera Jack Frost is a real winner in my book. It has lovely clouds of tiny, pale blue, airy flowers in the spring, resembling forget-me-nots. I grow this for the handsome foliage that lights up a shady spot in my garden. The heart- shaped silver leaves are edged and veined with green that remain attractive throughout the growing season. They form a dense and lush mound, which deer and rabbits resist.      One last flower that I want to mention is not too showy but is exotic, toad lily. It has small, intricate flowers that are born on upright, arching stems. Foliage varies with the cultivar, as do the flowers. The blooms remind me of a small orchid and the foliage is really interesting and often two tones of green.      When I hear people talking about ornamental grasses, I never got excited until I started growing Japanese forest grass All Gold. It forms a mound of small, arching gold leaves that grow to about 18 inches, a perfect size to go under a maple tree or to line a bed. Since its color is from the foliage, it goes well with darker foliage plants, looking pretty all season and brightening up the garden.      You cannot beat ferns for a lovely airy look for the shade garden. They lend a natural appeal to a shade spot and are very disease and pest resistant and require little care. Ferns are great companions for other perennials and they come in all sizes. My favorite is the maidenhair ferns, but I would not want to be without some of the autumn ferns either. Cinnamon ferns with a rusty brown hue, add a different dimension, especially as they come out of the ground in the spring.      Two other foliage plants to consider are Solomon's seal, with its graceful, arching stems and some of the gingers. Callaway ginger with its round evergreen leaves has a prominent silver-white mottling. It forms a large clump over time and you do not have to worry about deer dining on this plant.      One of the first things to know when planning a shade garden is to understand what kind of shade you have. Light shade or dappled shade means you have some sun but it is filtered or only sunny a few hours of the day. Deep shade is when you have large trees that block out direct sunlight. Plus, the soil can be damp and take certain plants or dry shade, requiring a different group of plants. These conditions will determine which plants are best for you to grow.

LINCOLN — The first round of stroke play qualifying for the 53rd Nebraska Match Play Championship is complete at Hillcrest Country Club in Lincoln, and three players are tied for the lead at 68.
 Fourteen players finished their rounds under-par Monday, which is the most in a stroke play qualifying round since 2015 at The Prairie Club in Valentine. That year, 17 players broke par on The Dunes Course.
 Three players sit atop the leaderboard, including Table Rock’s Calvin Freeman, Omaha’s Christian Hall and Norfolk’s Luke Kluver.
 Freeman was the low round in the morning wave. His bogey-free round included four birdies, three of which came in a four-hole stretch from holes No. 11-14. This is Freeman’s first NGA event after regaining his amateur status.
 Hall joined him at the top of the leaderboard in the afternoon. His round included six birdies and only two bogeys. His bogey-free back nine included four birdies that moved him to 4-under after an even-par front nine.
 The final player to get to 4-under was Kluver. He stumbled out of the gate, bogeying two of his first three holes. He kick-started his round on the fourth hole, when he holed out from about 120 yards for eagle. From there, he didn’t have a bogey for the rest of his round. He tacked on four more birdies to move to a tie for the lead.

BOSTON (AP) — A utility company was ordered Tuesday to pay a $53 million criminal fine for causing a series of natural gas explosions in Massachusetts that killed one person and damaged dozens of homes.
 Columbia Gas of Massachusetts was sentenced more than three months after the company pleaded guilty in federal court to causing the blasts that rocked three communities north of Boston in September 2018.
 As part of the plea agreement, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts will pay a $53 million fine for violating the Pipeline Safety Act. It’s the largest criminal fine ever imposed under the pipeline safety law.
 The judge also sentenced the company to a three-year probation period during which its operations will be monitored to ensure its complying with safety regulations, authorities said.
 Columbia Gas of Massachusetts has said it takes full responsibility for the disaster.
 After the plea deal was announced in February, Eversource said it agreed to buy Columbia Gas of Massachusetts’ natural gas assets for $1.1 billion. Federal authorities said the three-year probation period will last until Columbia Gas is sold.

What can today’s cities learn from countries like New Zealand and Taiwan?
 A smart city is one in which digital technology and innovation are the bedrock of efficient service delivery. In the context of the pandemic, it means a city can continue operating seamlessly even with lockdown and restriction measures since many tasks, such as delivery of goods, are automated and there is little or no reliance on manual processes which would necessitate constant human interactions.
 Private sector players have particularly been seen to drive this digital approach, swiftly adjusting to changing times across sectors. Both metropolitan and national governments are, therefore, required to provide enabling and conducive investment environment and trigger more innovations and technologies that would lessen the impact of the pandemic and other disruptions.
 Smart cities leverage on fact-based information and data to optimise resources, connect people and improve the business climate, which in turn facilitates trade. A smart city emphasizes efficiency. For instance, it may encourage the use of smart, energy-saving equipment with minimal impact on the environment, thus promoting sustainable development.
 At the same time, intelligent traffic systems can be installed to collect data and send information on traffic and road accidents to drivers and suggest less congested routes. Similarly, traffic lights are calibrated to regulate the smooth flow of vehicles in all directions to prevent traffic jams.
 Sensors installed in the light posts can turn lights on and off, depending on whether there is movement in the surrounding areas.
 Smart technologies also help in sending information on available parking spots to drivers looking to park in the area, meaning that they save valuable time and fuel, which in effect reduces pollution and congestion while also boosting productivity and the ease of doing business.
 Such technologies also promptly send information to hospitals and the police about road crashes, robberies and other unexpected occurrences. As a result, cities are safer and friendly places for all.
 In the same breadth, and this is one thing that cities in Kenya ought to think critically about, smart technologies can be applied to streamline garbage collection and improve urban beautification. Used correctly and consistently, they can also help authorities in tracing air pollution.
 When digitally-enabled, garbage bins can inform waste collection companies when they fill up, meaning there will be no spillage and sanitation is done on time— not too early or too late. A range of sensors can also be used to provide information on air and noise pollution, or to monitor water levels in rivers with a view to preventing deaths and destruction arising from floods.
 Next, resilient and sustainable cities are more inclusive in the sense that community participation is at the center of policymaking, as well as in the design and delivery of public services, and prioritisation of budgets and investments.
 For such highly functional cities, public participation is mandatory for projects to earn the consensus vote from the people intended to benefit or to be affected adversely.
 After all, it is the people who know what they are most in need of and what they treasure more between new developments and the status quo. Inclusivity also means the entire population, whether rich or poor, has equal access to basic services like education, healthcare and housing.
 Where cities are in charge of social welfare, they have invested in social safety nets, giving a lifeline to the most vulnerable groups. Such measures range from food rations to stipends for those who find themselves out of work. Such programmes cushion the population from economic shocks and adversities such as those caused by Coronavirus.
 Lastly, resilient cities strive to be environmentally sustainable. They, for example, set targets for achieving carbon neutrality while strengthening energy security, enhancing mobility and improving the quality of life.
 To achieve these goals, some have adopted sustainable approaches with a long- term impact on managing emissions from automobiles and power plants, including policies to encourage the transition to cleaner alternatives.
 For instance, non-motorised transport may be encouraged by dedicating safe infrastructure to cyclists and pedestrians and projecting such modes as fun and cool through modelling by leaders and influencers. Similarly, emission fees can be imposed to deter pollution alongside tax incentives for cleaner technologies.
 Adoption of a feebate (fee/rebate) system, for instance, could go a long way in this green drive, especially in developing nations like Kenya.
 With a feebate in place, buyers of environmentally-friendly cars, such as electric vehicles and newer, more fuel-efficient brands would be offered reliefs. On the other hand, owners of cars with carbon emissions above a set limit will be penalised. This is a model that is already working for several European nations like Denmark and Norway.
 However, when all is said and done, it should be noted that a smart and liveable city starts with the right planning. A liveable city has a competitive economy, where the poor can get by as much as the rich; it has a high quality of life, and a sustainable environment that ensures its citizenry enjoy clean air, water and other social and public amenities.
 To make a city pleasant to live in, over and above being smart, inclusive and sustainable, you need three other levers— planning, development and visionary governance. When designing urban plans, flexibility should be factored in, creating room for changes expected to take place in the future.
 A city’s liveability profile comes with the economic benefits of attracting tourists and investments as foreigners and locals alike get assured they can live, work and play in a safe, welcoming environment. On the flip side, poor roads, traffic jams, unstable electricity supply, and poor garbage collection and housing erode the shine off a jurisdiction’s appeal.
