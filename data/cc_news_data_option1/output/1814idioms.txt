Courts said the Map Act had allowed the state to take private land for future highways without immediately paying homeowners, leaving some waiting decades for compensation. The law aimed to save the DOT money in the long run by allowing the department to prevent land from being sold before it went up in value. But the plan didn’t work. Because the department stalled compensation for years, it now must fork out almost $1 billion, according to the DOT’s estimates.

NEW YORK (AP) — The record unemployment rate reported on Friday captured the pain of a nation where tens of millions of jobs suddenly vanished, devastating the economy and forcing President Donald Trump to overcome historic headwinds to win a second term.
 Just a few short months ago, Trump planned to campaign for reelection on the back of a robust economy. That's a distant memory after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April, leading to an unemployment rate of 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.
 There's no parallel in U.S. history for the suddenness or severity of the economic collapse, which is ravaging some states that are crucial to Trump's victory. The president is now tasked with convincing voters that the catastrophic jobs losses were the result of the pandemic — not his management of the public health crisis. He also argues that he deserves another chance to rebuild what the virus destroyed.
 “What I can do: I’ll bring it back,” Trump told Fox News on Friday. “It’s fully expected. There’s no surprise. Everybody knows that. Even the Democrats aren’t blaming me for that.”
 Bringing back jobs quickly won't be easy.
 Backdated statistics show that unemployment reached as high as 25% in 1933 during the Great Depression. A broader calculation of unemployment from April's jobs report suggests the rate might be nearly that high now, as the 14.7% rate doesn't include people who left the labor force or still consider themselves employed despite not working. But the efforts needed to contain the spread of the coronavirus have caused much more rapid job loss than during the 1930s.
 “The last time we had unemployment rates in this neighborhood, it took us five years to get there,” said Erica Groshen, an economist at Cornell University and former commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. “This time, we will have achieved that in two months.”

 Carolina will start the month with a visit from the Arizona Cardinals, with a trip down Interstate 85 to face NFC South rival Atlanta. A home date against the Chicago Bears, a trip to New Orleans and a Thursday night showcase matchup against the Falcons will close out October for the team.
   
 A visit to Arrowhead Stadium and reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City will start November for Carolina. Consecutive home matchups against Tampa Bay and Detroit follow, with a trip to Minnesota the week after Thanksgiving to end the team's November slate.
   
 After a Dec. 6 open date, the Panthers welcome the Denver Broncos to Bank of America Stadium the following Sunday. Carolina will make a trip to Green Bay and Lambeau Field for the second straight year, this time coming on either Dec. 19 or 20.
   
 Two days after Christmas will mark a reunion of sorts, Carolina exchanging season's greetings with former head coach Ron Rivera and his new team, the Washington Redskins. The Panthers finish out the 2020 NFL campaign with a visit from division foe New Orleans.
   
 Carolina's preseason schedule features a trip from Jacksonville, scheduled for Aug. 13-17. The Panthers will hit the road the following two weeks, traveling to New England and Baltimore before concluding the preseason at home against Pittsburgh.

Scalp cooling systems are used to treat hair loss caused by certain chemotherapeutic agents. Scalp Cooling/Cold cap can employ with all types of solid tumors that are treated with chemotherapeutic agents like alkylating agents (e.g. Cyclophosphamides), DNA intercalating agents/anthracyclines agents (e.g. doxorubicin) and taxanes (e.g. docetaxel). In cancer treatment, these drugs target rapidly dividing cell and keratinocytes matrix, which results in loss of hair. Scalp cooling systems work by reducing temperatures by a few degrees of the scalp. It can be used before, during or after the administration of chemotherapy. Scalp cooling systems also reduce the hair follicular blood flow which may minimize or prevent the hair fall. Hair fall frequently occurs due to the complete or partial atrophy of hair root, which results in constriction of the hair shaft and easy breakage. Cooling used to decelerate the metabolism of cells, and it leads to cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents localized to the scalp. Scalp cooling systems cause vasoconstriction which reduces the blood flow to the scalp, results in the reduction of chemotherapeutic agent deposition into the hair follicle. It leads to the lower effective dose may enter the hair follicles. 220 C is an optimum temperature that can reduce the alopecia. Scalp Cooling systems are helmet like structure with a coolant that generates a temperature of -15 and -40 Fahrenheit.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Saturday reported 18 new coronavirus cases after a spate of infections prompted authorities to urge bars and nightclubs to close, while U.S. job losses surged and China prepared to reopen more schools.
 The United States, Brazil and Italy wrestled with how to ease curbs on business and public activity. Others imposed new restrictions: Kuwait in the Middle East announced a nationwide lockdown from Sunday through May 30.
 Worldwide, the virus has infected at least 3.9 million people and killed more than 270,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University based on data reported by governments.
 A decline in new infections in South Korea and some other countries had prompted them to loosen controls that plunged the global economy into its worst slump since the 1930s.
 South Korea urged nightclubs to close for a month after new cases jumped above 10 for the first time in five days. The government had eased social distancing guidelines and plans to start reopening schools Wednesday.
 Most of the new Korean cases are linked to the Itaewon leisure district of the capital, Seoul, where a 29-year-old man visited three nightclubs before testing positive. The infections raised concern about a broader spread in Seoul, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.

It is beginning to look as if this epidemic will have restarted the search for new ways to rebalance societies toward greater equality and social justice. For nearly six decades visionaries of left and right in North America and Europe have wrestled over how to deliver the next step to a more modern social safety net. The largest missing ingredient most observed was a secure income, not just for the elderly and the poorest, but for the working poor as well.

But we believe very strongly in the long-term vitality of those markets. And as we emerge on the other side of this crisis and students get back to school, I think our tenants are going to thrive.

“This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” Trump said. “The tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens.”
 The positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19.
 Six people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.
 None of those people were exhibiting symptoms, but were asked to deplane so they could be tested “out of an abundance of caution,” a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - While the coronavirus pandemic has had deep impacts across the country, farms have taken a hit, too. With restaurants closing to diners, it’s created a domino effect to the farms they get ingredients from.Butchertown Grocery hasn’t been open for about two months. This weekend they are opening for carry out for the first time, which is some good news for local farms who provide fresh produce for them."We're in a transition of trying to get Butchertown Grocery open and we're starting out real slow," Chef Bobby Benjamin said. "We're saying hey what do we have? What can we get our hands on that's super fresh and at the same time give our guests an experience?"Benjamin has a love for food that shows in his dishes."These beautiful mushrooms," he said on Tuesday afternoon after a delivery from a far. "It's great to be able to pass them along to the next person."When Governor Beshear ordered all in-dining restaurants to close, it was a tough transition.“The very beginning was a nightmare to be clear, to be honest,” Benjamin said. “I think we’re all trying to figure out what the new norm is.”He’s been working out of Butchertown Bakery for the past few weeks while Butchertown Grocery has been closed.On Tuesday and Wednesday, he spent the afternoon prepping fresh produce that will go in dishes at Butchertown Grocery this weekend for carry out.“These [mushrooms] were picked [Monday],” he said. “And they’re going to be on the menu this weekend. The freshest mushroom I can get my hands on, so I’m pretty excited about that.”All of his ingredients come from local farms, like mushrooms from Oak Acres Mushrooms, and carrots from Spade and Table Farm."He treats his vegetables with as much care and respect and TLC that he does any protein he serves to a guest," Lisa Windhorst with Spade and Table Farm said.Benjamin said he and Lisa Windhorst connected a few years ago, after he tried one of Spade and Table Farm’s carrots.“I took a bite out of the carrot and I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll take everything you have,’” Benjamin said.Since then, they have worked together.“Butchertown Grocery is one of our biggest customers,” Lisa Windhorst said. “About 85 to 90 percent of everything we grow we grow specifically grow for them, sometimes at Chef Bobby Benjamin’s request. If he if wants a particular pepper, we’ve grown a particular pepper or a certain mix of tomatoes for a particular flavor profile. He has been, he has worked really hard to kind of change as he needed to through all of this and we’ve tried to accommodate as best we can to help him do that.”At Spade and Table Farm, Jeff and Lisa Windhorst are just starting their busy season, while many of their customers aren’t buying like usual.“For our restaurant customers, our sales to them are definitely down,” Jeff Windhorst said. “We’re kind of cranking on the hopes that this gets over with because we are all in. So if things go to heck and a hand basket this summer, we’ll see.”The rest of their products they sell at farmer’s markets and hope it will even out their cost in the end.“The nice thing about the small farmer’s market is it’s very easy to social distance and manage the crowds and manage what’s happening at your table,” Lisa Windhorst said.Jeff Windhorst said they have been to two smaller farmer's markets recently, where they have sold out of product, which is rare.“Demand at the farmer’s market has gone up, way up,” he said. “It’s probably 30 to 40 percent more. It may offset what we lose to other customers.”Butchertown Grocery is grateful to be reopening for carryout and a chance to support local farms, too.“Just trying to go ahead and take care of our farms that are close to us,” Benjamin said. “And it’s like everyone wins. We help them, they help us, they give us the freshest ingredients. We then give the freshest ingredients to our guests.”Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News. All rights reserved.

It is difficult to overstate this hole in the states’ argument, and in the entire nearly decade-long effort to defeat religious exemptions to the contraception mandate. The claim from Justice Ginsburg and others is that providing religious exemptions will harm women who will not get contraceptive coverage from their own employer. Yet nine years into the contraceptive mandate -- and after nine years of experience with a broad range of exemptions -- we have seen the opposite. Tens of millions of Americans continue to work for employers with grandfathered plans, which have been exempt from the mandate all along. Tens of millions more work for small employers who are not required by the law to provide _any_ health insurance at all. Thousands of houses of worship and related organizations have also been exempted since the Obama administration. And thousands more organizations received the benefit of injunctions from the last round of litigation.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Chad Pickard closed his Sioux Falls bike shop for two days this week just to catch up on a backlog of requests from people looking to have their ride serviced. While so many Sioux Falls retailers and restaurants are losing business during the COVID-19 crisis, Spoke-N-Sport has experienced an influx of extra requests during an already busy time of year. Pickard, who owns Spoke-N-Sport, said closing the store was a way to give his staff a mental health break while allowing them to get more customers back out riding as the weather improves. “Spring is always a busy time for us and always somewhat stressful,” Pickard told the Argus Leader. “But we’re doing about twice as much service as we’ve ever done.” A couple of weeks of warmer weather contributed to Spoke-N-Sport’s recent rush of service requests. Meanwhile, some of Pickard’s part-time workers are balancing responsibilities in their other jobs that have been more affected by the pandemic. He has firefighters, nurses and a pastor on staff, Pickard said. The extra requests are coming in as more Sioux Falls residents look to stay active. Gyms are closed, organized sports have been pushed back and even pick- up games at the local parks have been discouraged. Families instead have embraced outdoor activities like walks and bike rides to stay active. Customers usually come in with similar sentiments about needing to get back on two wheels — about pulling an old bike out from storage or needing to get themselves or the kids out and about, Pickard said. “There was a time when every kid learned how to ride a bike, and those kids are now adults and they remember how much they loved it,” Pickard said. “So let’s do it again. Let’s dig it out of the garage. Let’s find a new one.”

 “This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” the president said. “The tests are perfect, but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens and all of a sudden” it is not.
 Some experts said he has a point. “People need to understand the limitations of testing,” said Nellie Brown, the director of workplace health and safety programs at the Worker Institute at Cornell University, who is advising businesses on how to reopen safely. “When you take a test you’re basically getting a slice in time.

So with those tenants that we have negotiated rent deferrals with, there may be only partial payments in May. So I feel good about where we are month-to-date. In fact, I think we're ahead of where a lot of people were for the entire month of April. But do I expect to be where we were in April, probably not. I think it's going to moderate a bit.

 Bantamweight champion Henry Cejudo and former champ Dominick Cruz both made weight for their title bout as well.
 With the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer all on hold -- along with the US PGA Tour and LPGA -- White touts the return of UFC as a step toward normalcy and a boon for sport-starved fans.
 And he said US President Donald Trump would be watching, in a conference call with US sports league leaders back in April.
 "The president's take on it was we have to get live sports back first," White told the Los Angeles Times.
 "Show everybody how to do it safely. Give people who have to stay home some entertainment so they're not bouncing off the walls. From there, we can figure out how we get people back to work and how we get kids back to schools.
 He said by going first, he hoped other leagues might also reopen.
 White attempted to avoid California's lockdown measures when he planned the April 18 event on Indian casino land, but Walt Disney Co -- owner of UFC broadcaster ESPN -- later asked him to postpone.

TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - It’s not business as usual, but it’s a step closer.On Friday, stores across southern Arizona started to reopen as a part of Gov. Doug Ducey’s executive order earlier this month allowing some businesses to open up with social distancing measures.It’s a relief for some retail stores to be back open and operating, like Swindlers on University Boulevard.“Today’s our first day back and we’re really excited,” said manager Christina Romero. They have been closed since March 19 but still operating online. Romero said opening today was perfect timing as they can still get sales from remaining students before the summer. “We definitely wanted to open up this weekend for the last rush before the remainder of the students potentially go home or go to different places," Romero said.They’re sticking with limited hours and increased sanitation for the time being."We’re not taking cash and for the time being we’re not doing fitting rooms to avoid a little bit more contact.”But for some business owners, being extra cautious did not outweigh the risk.“The coronavirus is still happening," said Co-Owner of Antigone Books on Fourth Avenue Kate Stern.Stern said they’ll be keeping their doors locked and continue to fulfill online orders until they’re sure it’s safe.“Until it’s safe to re-open them and we don’t feel that we’re putting our staff and our customers at risk and ourselves,” Stern said.For the stores that are open, there are plenty of customers willing to shop.“I think everybody just has to be cautious," said customer Terry Cook.Under the consensus that it will be a while before running errands returns to feeling normal.“Until we can get a grip on this I believe that everybody needs to do their part and it’ll help,” Cook said.Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13.

The report opines that the organic feed market will significantly benefit from growing rate of organic meat consumption, which can be attributed to constantly changing lifestyle, and cultural trends perceived in youth population. Accelerated demand for organic meat, driven by the consumer inclination toward consumption of protein-rich diets in light of rising fitness and health consciousness, will fuel demand for organic feed in the upcoming years. Organic feed producers are therefore focusing on expansion of the production capacities, in a bid to cater increasing demand.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary has the coronavirus, the White House said, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week.
 President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide, said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.
 Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller, who tested positive Friday, had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.
 Katie Miller had tested negative Thursday, a day before her positive result.
 “This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” Trump said. “The tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens.”
 The positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19.

Living Free has a much more Christian focus than AA’s focus on “a higher power as you understand him.” But religious belief is not required or expected of the participants.
 Eleanor Estes, who was instrumental in bringing Living Free to White County, indicated that she has had atheists and agnostics attend and benefit from the classes.
 Where AA focuses on recovery from alcoholism, Living Free looks on a broader scale, addressing many forms of unhealthy coping strategies. Their goal is to guide individuals in discovering how to overcome harmful or destructive patterns.
 Their weekly classes include dealing with depression, anger, grief, PTSD, fear and finding peace. Living Free also supports families with classes on parenting, caring for aging parents, and restoring family relationships.
 In addition to weekly classes, Living Free offers a 13-week recovery program called “Stepping into Freedom,” providing twice-weekly classes to inmates of the county jail and can be a part of Carroll County court-ordered treatment plans.
 Living Free is an evidence-based program claiming an 89 percent success rate.
 Currently in White County, there are Living Free programs at two locations on Monday evenings. The classes run from eight to 12 weeks.
 Dian and Ed Davis, directors of Carroll County Lifeline Connection and state leaders for Living Free, emphasize that “we want to meet people at their point of need. You don’t have to be at a certain level of maturity to benefit. You can come as you are. Our goal is to help people become the best version of themselves they can possibly be.”
 Living Free membership is open to anyone.
 The Davis’ also mentioned that they are always looking for new facilitators. They need people who are stable, like-minded and have a heart for this volunteer ministry. Training is provided.
 For more information on Living Free in White or Carroll counties, contact Ed or Dian Davis dian@cclifeline.org or call them at 765-426-2062.

One too many trips to the dessert bar will leave you feeling queasy. A visit from the royals puts the family and the staff on edge in the 2019 theatrical feature “Downton Abbey” (7 p.m., HBO).
 Essentially, this is a movie-length take on the beloved U.K. series seen here on PBS. Most of the major characters show up and go through their charming motions. The locations are pretty, and the film is nicely shot. But there’s little story and little tension to interest us. Even Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) seems bored.
 It’s a vast understatement to say this feature adds little to the story. If anything, it subtracted from my appreciation of the series. While watching the film, I actually began to wonder why I ever watched “Downton Abbey” in the first place. It’s that pointless.

As an athlete and now a coach, Brett Ballard has spent a major portion of his life in a gym.
   
 These days, particularly in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the Washburn men's basketball coach is spending a lot more time in front of his computer.
   
 State high school tournaments in Kansas and across the nation were disrupted in mid-March by COVID-19, which also affected on-campus and in-home visits as well as all-star games and the start of the AAU and MAYB seasons.
   
 As a result, tools of the information age have increasingly become the lifeblood of recruiting for Ballard and coaches everywhere.
   
 "I'm really thankful for the technology that we have now, which allows us to get a lot of film on these young men,'' said Ballard, who has signed five high school seniors from five different states for the 2020-21 season.
   
 "That allows us to evaluate them through game film and through their highlights, so we have a pretty good feel of what type of player they are.''
   
 Ballard still prefers to see recruits in live action, but that isn't always possible, particularly during the current situation.
   
 "We try to get out and watch them live as much as we can, but we're thankful that we have the technology to allow us to watch these guys via film on our computers,'' he said.
   
 "And obviously we do our homework through communicating with the young man and with the people around them, their coaches and family.''
   
 Recruiting has definitely been impacted by the current situation, particularly for schools trying to get a jump start on recruiting for 2021-22, but Ballard said things could be a lot worse.
   
 "Now if this would have happened 10 years ago even, it would have been extremely challenging just because of what was available and how easy you could get it was so much different,'' Ballard said.
   
 "You would have to been waiting for somebody to send you a DVD in the mail and then you may have been able to evaluate them through that, but it's just so much easier in this day and age.''
   
 Washburn capped its '20-'21 recruiting class with Friday's announcement that the Ichabods had signed Zach Davidson, a 6-foot-8 forward out of Augusta.
   
 Davidwon was a second-team All-Class 4A pick after averaging 15.5 points and 9.4 rebounds and leading the Orioles to the 4A semifinals.
   
 The Ichabods signed 6-6 Michael Keegan (Dyersville, Iowa) during last fall's early signing period and signed 6-4 Nate Lacey (Brookfield, Maryland), 6-5 Cade Blevins (Rogersville, Mo.) and 6-5 Azeem Ross (Dallas) in April.
   
 Keegan averaged 19.4 points and shot 57% from the field as a senior, while Lacey averaged 17.6 points and 10.7 rebounds, Blevins averaged 16 points and Ross 12 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists.
   
 The current recruiting class was a perfect example of the electronic approach to recruiting.
   
 "Two of the five we had seen play high school and AAU basketball, but then the other three were guys that kind of came on our radar later in the year and we have not seen live, just on the film we have been able to access,'' Ballard said.
   
 Now the key is to see how the recruiting class fits with a 12-player group of returners from last year's 16-13 team, led by senior All-MIAA first-team point guard Tyler Geiman.
   
 "I'm excited about this class,'' Ballard said. "We've got some good, good players coming in and what it's going to do is it's going to create competition at every spot and we could potentially be deep at every spot.
   
 "The cream will rise to the top and we'll sort out who's going to earn the minutes, but I think one through 15 we've got a chance to be one of the deepest teams in our league.''

 The point is the battle lines have been drawn against the SPFL and this isn’t a bad place for them to be when it comes to the next wee while.
 Deflection. Picking fights and battles with authority when mistakes are made on the pitch.
 Pointing to officials getting things wrong when they lose Cup Finals when they had enough chances to win six games at Hampden against Celtic in the Betfred Cup final and didn’t take one.

Joseph Daniel Armstrong, 84, died Wednesday, May 6, 2020 in Buzzards Bay, MA from an Aortic Aneurysm.
 He leaves behind his four children, Karl "Dan" Armstrong and wife Theresa, Beth L. Kerr and husband Bob, Gregory T. Armstrong and wife Mihaela, and Steven E. Armstrong and wife Ada. Joe is also survived by seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
 He was preceded in death by his wife, Dorothy Elizabeth Armstrong, who died in September, 2018 at the age of 86. They were married for 60 years.
 Born in Lancaster, PA August 1, 1935 where his parents, Ed and Betty Armstrong lived and operated their own business, Joe loved to read and had an ongoing desire to learn. Following that passion, he moved to Florida. There he earned bachelor's degrees from Southeastern University (formerly Southeastern Bible College) and Florida Southern College. Joe also acquired a Masters in Social Work from Florida State University. His concern for the disabled led to a career in the Department of Veterans Affairs as a Chief of Social Work for over three decades at various hospitals. Joe's work steered him from St. Petersburg, FL to Bath, NY, to Pittsburgh, PA and then finally Coatesville, PA. While at Coatesville, he taught graduate-level social work courses at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) as an adjunct instructor.
 Throughout his life, Joe was actively involved in church. He served on deacon boards in Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania and played a crucial role in the founding of New Life Assembly of God, Lancaster.
 Known for his sense of humor, love of vegetable gardening, concern for the less fortunate and a dogged work ethic, Joe volunteered at various community organizations after his retirement.
 A memorial service honoring both Joe and Dorothy will be held later this year in Lancaster.

In Mexico City, the doubts started a month ago, when the city’s mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, began to suspect that federal data and modeling on the epidemic were flawed, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
 She had already instructed her staff to call every public hospital in the Mexico City area to ask about all confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths, the people said. In the last week, that effort found that the deaths were more than three times what the federal government reported.
 The disagreements have taken place largely behind the scenes, as Sheinbaum, who declined to comment for this article, has been loath to publicly embarrass President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, her close political ally. The city and the federal government continue to work together on a number of fronts, including getting ventilators.
 But the data from Mexico City calls into question the federal government’s grasp of the crisis in the country.
 With such limited testing and doubts about the government’s models, experts say federal estimates for when the nation will reach its peak, how long the epidemic will last and how bad the damage will be may not be reliable.
 That disconnect has left cities and states across the country scrambling to meet the demand for protective equipment and ventilators. It also underplays the severity of the epidemic for millions of Mexicans, making it hard for them to determine how bad the situation is — and how seriously to take it.

On the other hand, the film suspends us in an attitude of uneasy humour about Catherine’s destiny. This strategy primarily manifests in the figure of Marlene Dietrich, an icon of screen irony. The viewer never once believes in the innocence of Christina even back in Prussia as a young maiden. Dietrich plays up the plain country girl stereotype, feigning wide-eyed naïveté and real love. Starting from this, _The Scarlet Empress_ effects a progressive ‘defeminisation’ of Catherine, her billowing white frock slowly giving way to military furs and finally to a dazzling white uniform with coat and trousers. Catherine’s rise to power thus coincides with a merging of the character with the Dietrich persona. The actor conveys Catherine’s sexual maturity with tremendous humour and wit. The joke on paper (that Catherine the Great slept with the whole Russian army) is taken through all its variations by Dietrich’s actorly intelligence, her manner of introducing wholly gratuitous but suggestive sentence breaks (“And your duties… Dmitri?”) and her typical way of sizing up men around her.

MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government is not reporting hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths from the coronavirus in Mexico City, dismissing anxious officials who have tallied more than three times as many fatalities in the capital than the government publicly acknowledges, according to officials and confidential data.
 The tensions have come to a head in recent weeks, with Mexico City alerting the government to the deaths repeatedly, hoping it will come clean to the public about the true toll of the virus on the nation’s biggest city and, by extension, the country at large.
 But that has not happened. Doctors in overwhelmed hospitals in Mexico City say the reality of the epidemic is being hidden from the country. In some hospitals, patients lie on the floor, splayed on mattresses. Elderly people are propped up on metal chairs because there are not enough beds, while patients are turned away to search for space in less-prepared hospitals. Many die while searching, several doctors said.
 “It’s like we doctors are living in two different worlds, ” said Dr. Giovanna Avila, who works at Hospital de Especialidades Belisario Domínguez. “One is inside of the hospital with patients dying all the time. And the other is when we walk out onto the streets and see people walking around, clueless of what is going on and how bad the situation really is.”
 Mexico City officials have tabulated more than 2,500 deaths from the virus and from serious respiratory illnesses that doctors suspect were related to COVID-19, according to the data, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Yet the federal government is reporting about 700 in the area, which includes Mexico City and the municipalities on its outskirts.
 Nationwide, the federal government has reported about 3,000 confirmed deaths from the virus, plus nearly 250 suspected of being related, in a country of more than 120 million people. But experts say Mexico has only a minimal sense of the real scale of the epidemic because it is testing so few people.

Well, our product at the end of the day is the dividend that grows. And so we take that decision very seriously. And we made the decision to suspend it in an abundance of caution and with really the focus of being able to fully reinstate that dividend. And as you mentioned, we enjoy one of the lowest payout ratios in the sector. We're not taking significant risk from a redevelopment perspective, it's all pre-leased. We have a huge amount of liquidity, far more liquidity than we need over the next several years. And this is really a decision of conservatism as we look at the potential for tenant failures and the potential to be on the other side of this, if you haven't addressed the dividend of needing to raise equity at what could be possibly the worst potential time. And when you look back to 2008, 2009, huge amounts of shareholder value were destroyed by companies putting themselves in the position of needing to issue equity at the wrong time.

 But 45 minutes into their 7:30 p.m. performance before a packed house at the Mirage, Horn introduced Montecore, a 7-year-old royal white Siberian tiger.
 When the tiger refused to obey Horn’s command to lie down, Horn reportedly tapped the cat on the nose with his microphone to get his attention. The 600-pound animal responded by pawing Horn’s arm. And as Horn stumbled, the tiger lunged at the entertainer’s neck and dragged him offstage. Frantic crew members sprayed the animal with a fire extinguishers until it released Horn.
 According to a family friend, Horn told the paramedics rushing him to the hospital, “Don’t kill the cat.”

A motorcycle sidecar is a single-wheeled device that is attached to the side of a motorcycle, moped/scooter, or electric or normal bicycle. The attachment of a motorcycle sidecar to a two-wheeler converts it into a three-wheeled vehicle. A two-wheeler with an attached motorcycle is also known as a combination, rig, or hack. The body of the motorcycle usually provides a seat for a single passenger, and has a small trunk-like compartment on the rear side of the body. In some cases, the motorcycle sidecar is modified for the transportation of cargo or tools & equipment, just like the platform of transport vehicles such as trucks. Generally, motorcycle sidecars consist of the body and the frame. The frame is either fixed to the motorcycle or is attached in such a way that the motorcycle can lean in the similar way as that of a motorcycle without a sidecar.

After weeks of being closed for traditional business, stores in downtown Burlington were forced to get creative to maintain sales. Now with the reopening, they will have adapt to social distancing guidelines.
   
 For the past several weeks Pinned it Creations and other non-essential businesses in Iowa have been closed to in-person traffic. Recently in 77 Iowa counties, including nearby Lee County, businesses were allowed to reopen. However, Des Moines County businesses were under the same restrictions that had been implemented throughout the month of April. Gov. Kim Reynolds said starting today, retail business can reopen in all 99 counties, as long as they follow social distancing guidelines, limit the number of customers to 50% capacity and follow increased hygiene practices.
   
 At Pinned It Creations, 400 Jefferson St., creativity has been the name of the game.
   
 "It has just been amazing," owner Jamie Grabowski explained.
   
 Grabowski said she's still planning to open on May 15. She said her goal was to do work on the store by that date, as it would be the first day the businesses would have been allowed to reopen. She said the last minute change in open date hasn't changed her plans to open next weekend.
   
 During the time the store has been closed, Pinned It Creations had "Take and Make" kits available in the stores in Burlington and in Monmouth, Illinois. The kits encouraged families to make their own creations at home and were ordered throughout the week and then picked up during a three hour time frame. Grabowski said the kits worked so well that her store sold the same amount in three hours she would normally sell an entire weekend.
   
 In addition to some new window displays, Grabowski said she's hoping to get a liquor license to sell wine for customers. She said people have been bringing in wine, but this has prompted her to think about a license.
   
 When she officially opens back up, Grabowski said she's going to take it slow. She likely will be limited to private events and a few customers at a time until she feels comfortable and more restrictions are lifted.
   
 Red Screen Door and Gypsi owner Doreen Roy said she hadn't had time to focus on projects. Instead, she said she's been busy going back and forth between her two Jefferson Street stores. Roy said between deliveries, taking pictures and trying to be as accessible as possible, she's doing as much as she can to keep the businesses afloat.
   
 But on Thursday, one day before being legally allowed to reopen her store to members of the public, she and her employees were preparing the store for customers.
   
 "I got the word last night, we have been working all day today," she told The Hawk Eye on Thursday.
   
 She said the in-person closures affected Gypsy, her clothing store, more than Red Screen Door, a home furnishing store. She said since customers can't try on clothes that part of the business is stagnant.
   
 When customers couldn't come into her stores, Roy said she was using technology to provide customers with a shopping experience. She has accomplished this with regularly videos posts on her Facebook page. Customers can message the page, or call Roy's stores, to place an order. Roy also has offered curbside shopping where she brings the items out to customers for them to look at.
   
 Roy said she's even begun delivering products to those who can't get out of the house. Anything that can be done to secure a sale.
   
 For the time being, Roy said she will still do curbside, delivery and shipping. She said people may not feel comfortable being out in public so she wants to continue with the service.
   
 Burlington by the Book owner Chris Murphy said sales declined by more than two-thirds, and that's on a good day. But Murphy said he's still been blown away by the support of the community he has seen.
   
 "People have just been great," Murphy said.
   
 Murphy said people are continuing to seek out books from the store, even asking him to order books. Throughout the mandated closure Murphy still opened at his normal hours and sold books over the phone for curbside pick up.
   
 When he heard the news he could reopen, he was thrilled. Murphy said the guidelines put into place by Gov. Reynolds pose no issues to his business.
   
 Murphy's business has been impacted in other ways too. Burlington by the Book routinely has authors come in to sign books. He said he has canceled several events since COVID-19 forced him to close.
   
 One of these planned events which had to be canceled was for independent bookstore day. Murphy said the day, which is held at the end of April, celebrates small local bookstores. He planned for the event to be a massive celebration which would include several authors and even a wedding of mythical creatures.
   
 He said it is hard to tell when he will start having events again, since those are the busiest events and do fill his store. He wants to make sure when his events do begin again it is safe for all who want to participate.

“We are with nothing at all literally. Not even food stamps,” a woman in East Chicago said. She and her husband filed for unemployment compensation on March 28 after being laid off by the Ameristar Casino. Neither has received a first check.
 “I started calling last week Thursday. And, when I first called I had got the ‘If you press one, you can get the return call or whatever,’” Robin White said on the phone last week. “I waited that whole day and never got a call back, so the following day I called back and then waited four hours and then the phone hung up. I was so upset.”
 She said someone on social media recommended she try calling at 7 a.m., as Indianapolis is one hour ahead of East Chicago. She finally got through to someone, but the woman indicated she couldn’t pull up White’s case.
 “I thought that was bizarre. I’m like, ‘You can’t look it up, you can’t tell me exactly what’s going on with my case?’”
 The woman told her to just sit tight and wait.
 The thing about unemployment compensation that a lot of people sort of know, but sort of forget, is that it’s not welfare. It’s insurance, with the premiums paid by every employer in the state.
 It may be interesting to theorize that we would be a better country if it didn’t exist. People would save more, maybe, and take on less debt; they’d plant more vegetable gardens, and they might build their own homes with their bare hands.
 But the fact is we do have it, and businesses pay into the fund. So it’s not government acting out of charity, it’s forced communal savings to prevent people from starving when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own.
 That said, every Facebook post by the Department of Workforce Development is loaded up with comments from people pleading for help. Almost all say the same thing: It’s been more than four weeks, they haven’t gotten a check and can’t get through to the DWD when they call.
 “I have called at least four or five times,” said Fred Eddelman, who was laid off from his job at a powdered-metal plant in North Vernon where he makes connecting rods for automobile companies.
 “One day I was on hold for two hours,” he said. “When I finally got through they said they would transfer me to somebody else. It dropped the call as soon as I transferred. I was on hold for another two hours to get through. They said they would transfer me. That took another two hours.
 “And when I talked to somebody they just said, ‘Well, there’s really nothing you can do but just wait.’ So, I was on hold for a total of six hours for about a 20-second conversation that basically said, you know, there’s nothing you can do.”
 Many of his friends who were laid off about the same time, the third week in March, have started getting unemployment checks. But he hasn’t. He said he thinks it’s because on the first weekly voucher he filed, he recorded that he worked two days that week before the layoff. The online system tells him that an investigator will contact him or his employer.
 “But no claims investigator’s ever contacted me,” he said. Eddelman is 58, and he’s never filed for unemployment before in his life — before now.
 Josh Richardson, chief of staff at the Department for Workforce Development said they are talking with as many people as they can.
 “We’re actually talking to about 11,000 people per day when you look at all of the available operators that we have, and what we’re working on,” he said. “So there are a lot of people that are getting through and that we are talking to. It’s just that the volume is so extremely high and because we have people calling multiple times that it’s just made that wait time really difficult. So, we’re working on that.”

WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy suffered its biggest labor market shock on record last month, as government figures released Friday showed the COVID-19 pandemic erased 20.5 million jobs and sent the nation’s unemployment rate to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 As recently as February, the United States had enjoyed record economic expansion and the lowest unemployment in half a century, 3.5%. Not only is that gone, but more bad news is almost certain in the weeks and months ahead.
 “It’s just staggering,” said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis at the National Federation of Independent Business, referring to the economic damage wrought by the pandemic.
 The unemployment rate was 4.4% in March and there were 870,000 job losses that month, according to revised figures that reflected the early stages of business shutdowns and mass layoffs.
 Grasping for reasons to be hopeful, analysts noted that a large majority of April’s payroll job losses will be classified as temporary, and some furloughed workers have been recalled in recent days as more states begin to relax lockdowns and lift stay-at-home orders.
 Still, many layoffs have no definite end date, and more could become permanent as the impact of the pandemic continues to spread.
 Many medical experts and government officials expect a second wave of infections as states begin to relax social distancing rules, though the new surge is not likely to show up in the data until late summer or early fall.
 Even where businesses are reopening, many are operating only partially, with limits on capacity and relatively few workers on hand. Customer demand remains unknown and start-up expenses may be wasted if new outbreaks occur, forcing another round of shutdowns.
 Similarly, many employees are wary of returning when their own safety is uncertain. Polls suggest it may be months before most people are comfortable going out to shop at a mall, boarding an airplane or visiting restaurants and hotels and other public venues.
 And the longer consumers hold back on spending, which accounts for 70% of total U.S. economic activity, the greater the chance that many employers will have cash flow problems and decide they can’t go on.
 “A lot of the recovery is going to depend upon businesses being there to reattach the displaced labor,” said Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute. “And if the regiments aren’t there, the soldiers aren’t going to be able to come back.”
 Friday’s grim jobs report was largely expected but will nonetheless add to the rancorous debate in Washington on what additional policies, if any, are needed in the face of a cratering economy.
 In political terms, the sudden economic collapse has upended President Donald Trump’s reelection strategy that had counted on solid, positive performance in the jobs market and the overall economy.
 He regularly trumpeted the pre-pandemic economy as the best in U.S. history. Such claims are now likely to ring hollow in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where paper-thin margins were critical to his Electoral College victory in 2016.
 As for the record low unemployment rates reported for African Americans and Latinos before the pandemic struck, those are history too. Those groups and others, including workers with only high school diplomas, have been hit especially hard, partly because of their larger representation in sectors slammed by the health crisis, such as food services, hospitality and other leisure businesses.
 “In any economic downturn the most disadvantaged people are the ones that ultimately get hurt the most,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director at Indeed Hiring Lab.

The record unemployment rate reported on Friday captured the pain of a nation where tens of millions of jobs suddenly vanished, devastating the economy and forcing President Donald Trump to overcome historic headwinds to win a second term.
 Just a few short months ago, Trump planned to campaign for reelection on the back of a robust economy. That’s a distant memory after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April, leading to an unemployment rate of 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.
 There’s no parallel in U.S. history for the suddenness or severity of the economic collapse, which is ravaging some states that are crucial to Trump’s victory. The president is now tasked with convincing voters that the catastrophic jobs losses were the result of the pandemic — not his management of the public health crisis. He also argues that he deserves another chance to rebuild what the virus destroyed.
 “What I can do: I’ll bring it back,” Trump told Fox News on Friday. “It’s fully expected. There’s no surprise. Everybody knows that. Even the Democrats aren’t blaming me for that.”

Looks matter and first impressions count! So to pique the interest of potential buyers, refresh your home’s exterior and boost the curb appeal with new siding. In-the-know design pros are choosing cypress siding for the upgrade. It looks great and can last a lifetime, no matter what Mother Nature might have in store.
 "Cypress siding offers the complete package," says Zack Rickman of the Southern Cypress Manufacturers Association, www.CypressInfo.org. "It's not only beautiful, it offers proven outdoor performance by naturally repelling insects -- like termites and carpenter bees -- and minimizing decay, chemical corrosion and other damaging elements."
 Wood siding offers a timeless look that is often imitated, but never really duplicated. And while there are many siding products to choose from, homebuilder Stephen Ellis, MGB Fine Custom Homes of Sarasota, Florida, chooses cypress. And for good reasons!
 “Often we clad our homes entirely in cypress,” he says. “It’s a material we enjoy working with because it’s dimensionally stable and holds up well in our humid, coastal environment. And it’s locally sourced, which is something homeowners are valuing now more than ever. Ultimately, the decision comes down to the architectural style of the home, maintenance and cost. I do my best to help homeowners make an informed decision based on their goals.”
 When it comes to picking a siding style, cypress is available in all the popular patterns, like traditional bevel or modern shiplap. Yet in Ellis’ area, he’s seeing a different trend. “These days, we’re putting up a lot of board and batten,” he says. “It’s always been popular for farm houses, but it looks great on beach homes and complements the casual, relaxing vibe.”
 “If you’re drawn to cypress’ natural honey-like hues and want to enhance the natural richness of its color and grain pattern, focus on semi-transparent, oil-based stains,” Rickman advises. “These products provide superior protection because they penetrate the wood and allow it to breathe, whereas water-based stains sit on the surface and are prone to peeling and cracking.”
 If a cleaner, solid color look is more your style, Rickman says 100 percent acrylic latex paint, with a compatible primer, is the way to go to ensure cypress’ best performance.
 Architect John Harrison Jones, Memphis, Tennessee, says some of his clients prefer the weathered wood look. “It’s contextual to our region and environment,” he says. “And while cypress is naturally decay and water resistant, I still recommend applying a water-repellent sealer to provide added protection. Some products include an ultraviolet light inhibitor to block the sun’s rays and prevent premature graying. Nevertheless, cypress will weather to a light gray patina over time.
 “If you want the weathered look now, consider applying a bleaching stain with a subtle gray tint. But, be careful not to apply too much because it can get too light. Test it out on a piece of scrap wood first.”
 Whichever finish you choose, Rickman recommends always applying stain, primer or sealer to all sides and edges of the boards. “This will protect the wood from moisture and prevent problems down the road,” he says. “And perhaps most importantly, make sure to follow the finish manufacturer’s instructions.”

Over 360 Kashmiri students stranded in parts of Madhya Pradesh due to the lockdown will be sent back to their native places in air-conditioned buses from Bhopal on May 9, an official said.
 As many as 365 Kashmiri students stuck in different districts of the State will return home in 18 buses from Bhopal, a public relations department official said.
 The students are currently accommodated in a private school in the Gandhinagar locality of Bhopal, he said, adding that they will leave at around 2 p.m. on May 9.
 District Collector Tarun Pithode and other officials visited the private school on the night of May 8 to take stock of the arrangements there.
 Sources said that another group of Kashmiri students will leave from Indore.
 Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had recently written a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, requesting for necessary arrangements for the nearly 400 Kashmiri students stuck in the State.
 He had said that as Jammu and Kashmir is under the central rule, it is the Centre’s duty to help the people from that region stranded in different parts of the country.

No matter said golf industry lost five glorious early May days starting last Saturday to conduct business and get their cash registers ringing for the first time in the 2020 season. That’s water under the bridge that cannot be retrieved.
 At least the government made the announcement before 10 a.m. on a quite nice Thursday so that May 7 could be a golfing day for at least eight hours.
 Let’s just be grateful real golf has finally returned to our lives – Covid-19 pandemic be damned.
 Most important, now that the billion dollar Massachusetts golf industry has been resurrected – the first major non-essential Bay State economy to be so allowed by Baker and his Reopening Advisory Board, it now is incumbent on every golfer in the Commonwealth to recognize and adhere to EVERY guideline laid out regarding how we golfers must conduct ourselves on the golf course; guidelines enacted to hopefully ensure that the Covid-19 virus does not infect anyone walking their favorite golfing turf.
 Read those guidelines once a day until further notice.
 This is critical for the golf industry. We golfers cannot screw this part up. We must set the example for the rest of the state. Simple as that. We do this right and golf can be remembered for setting the stage for the reopening of countless other economies.

At this point, there's just too much uncertainty in the environment to give any more specific color, I think, as it relates to 2020.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary has the coronavirus, the White House said, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week.President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide, said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller, who tested positive Friday, had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.Katie Miller had tested negative Thursday, a day before her positive result.“This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” Trump said. “The tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens.”The positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19.Six people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.None of those people were exhibiting symptoms, but were asked to deplane so they could be tested “out of an abundance of caution,” a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.The official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence's staff — which works next door in the Executive Office Building — are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.Pence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday. Miller tweeted she was “doing well” and looked forward to getting back to work.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president.Meadows said the White House was “probably the safest place that you can come,” but he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.The White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.“We’ve already put in a few protocols that we’re looking at, obviously, to make sure that the president and his immediate staff stay safe. But it’s not just the president, it’s all the workers that are here ... on a daily basis," Meadows said.Trump's valet's case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March. The valet tested positive Wednesday.The White House was moving to shore up its protection protocols to protect the nation’s political leaders. Trump said some staffers who interact with him closely would now be tested daily. Pence told reporters Thursday that both he and Trump would now be tested daily as well.___Madhani reported from Chicago.

While projections had long suggested that Nebraska’s coronavirus pandemic would peak at the end of April, it appears that cases have only plateaued at best — and at much higher levels than had been seen just weeks earlier, said Dr. Mark Rupp, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
 That’s concerning, he said, as the recent surge is coming at a time businesses are starting to open and people are becoming fatigued with social distancing measures.
 “I think it’s too early to say we have peaked in our community, particularly Douglas County,” Rupp said. “We are not out of the woods by any means.”
 Ricketts on Friday declined to say whether he thinks the state has peaked. He noted the University of Washington model that once had Nebraska cases peaking in late April now has moved the peak into early May.
 But he said he’s not so much focused on the current case numbers as he is on whether Nebraska’s hospitals are being overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, and they’re not. That shows the social distancing restrictions Nebraska put in place have worked, he said.
 “We slowed down the spread of the virus, we flattened the curve, so that peak did not overwhelm our health care system,” he said.
 There’s no doubt the measures the state and its businesses and citizens have taken in the two months since Nebraska saw its first coronavirus case have made the state’s infection curve flatter than it would have been — preventing infections and saving lives. But it would be a stretch to call Nebraska’s current curve flat.

Pero los expertos dicen que México solo tiene un panorama mínimo de la escala real de la epidemia porque está haciendo pruebas a muy pocas personas. Solo 0,4 personas de cada mil en México se hacen la prueba del virus. El gobierno dice que a México le ha ido mejor que a muchos de los países más grandes del mundo, y esta semana el zar del Covid-19 calculó que la cifra total de muertos sería de alrededor de 6000. "Hemos aplanado la curva", dijo esta semana Hugo López-Gatell, el funcionario de la Secretaría de Salud que se ha convertido en el rostro de la respuesta del país.

NAREIT FFO in the first quarter was $0.46 per share, and same-property NOI growth was 3%, driven by a 400 basis point contribution from base rent. These results reflect additional reserves taken in light of COVID-19 with respect to certain nonessential watch list tenants based on a comprehensive financial and liquidity review. These reserves are included in both revenues deemed uncollectible and straight-line rent, totaling $2.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Absent these reserves, same-property NOI growth would have been 4.3% and NAREIT FFO would have been $0.48 per share.

 Guess it's only right the former South Point standout will make his NFL debut there as well.
 The Carolina Panthers will welcome the Belmont native and his Las Vegas Raider teammates to kickoff the 2020 NFL season on Sept. 13.
 After hosting the Raiders, Carolina then hits the road to close out September, getting its first crack at Tom Brady and the new look Tampa Bay Buccaneers, followed by a trip to the west coast and the Los Angeles Chargers. Kickoff for the latter matchup is at 4:05, also marking the franchise's first trip to the Rams' new digs at SoFi Stadium.
 The Panthers are scheduled for five games in October, alternating home and road dates.
 Carolina will start the month with a visit from the Arizona Cardinals, with a trip down Interstate 85 to face NFC South rival Atlanta. A home date against the Chicago Bears, a trip to New Orleans and a Thursday night showcase matchup against the Falcons will close out October for the team.
 A visit to Arrowhead Stadium and reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City will start November for Carolina. Consecutive home matchups against Tampa Bay and Detroit follow, with a trip to Minnesota the week after Thanksgiving to end the team's November slate.
 After a Dec. 6 open date, the Panthers welcome the Denver Broncos to Bank of America Stadium the following Sunday. Carolina will make a trip to Green Bay and Lambeau Field for the second straight year, this time coming on either Dec. 19 or 20.
 Two days after Christmas will mark a reunion of sorts, Carolina exchanging season's greetings with former head coach Ron Rivera and his new team, the Washington Redskins. The Panthers finish out the 2020 NFL campaign with a visit from division foe New Orleans.
 Carolina's preseason schedule features a trip from Jacksonville, scheduled for Aug. 13-17. The Panthers will hit the road the following two weeks, traveling to New England and Baltimore before concluding the preseason at home against Pittsburgh.
 Single-game tickets for the Panthers' 2020 slate are currently on sale at Panthers.com/Tickets or via Ticketmaster.

BIGGSVILLE, Ill. -- This was supposed to be the time for Nathan Bigger to showcase his talents.
   
 The West Central High School senior pitcher was looking forward to his senior year on the hill for the Heat, where he was all set to have a breakout year, dominate opposing batters, lead a young Heat team to a winning season and show college coaches that he is, indeed, ready to succeed at the next level.
   
 All of that was thrown out the window last month when the Illinois High School Athletic Association canceled all spring sports and state tournament series due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 That has thrown a monkey wrench into Bigger's plans, forcing him to come up with a plan B.
   
 So at least for now, Bigger is making do, trying his best to stay in shape and hoping things get back to some semblance of normalcy soon.
   
 "It's been a little interesting to say the least. This is nothing anybody expected. We expected everyone to be going to school, going to baseball practice, being around everyone," said Bigger, The Hawk Eye's Senior Spotlight Athlete of the Week. "It stinks, but there is nothing that can really be done about it. You just have to take it and do the best you can."
   
 "I'm devastated for our seniors," West Central baseball coach Quinn Leath said. "A guy like Nate Bigger had to sit through some mediocre baseball seasons. This year was looking very promising. We had the most guys out this year I've ever had out. We had 19 guys. In Illinois Class 1A ball, you can really compete with 19 guys. We had a lot of competition going on the team. By the second week of practice we heard rumblings and wondered is Illinois would follow suit. It's devastating news to hear."
   
 West Central was expecting to have a big season this spring. With a talented senior class leading the way for a solid group of incoming freshmen, the Heat had 19 players on the team for the first two weeks of practice, a number Leath felt could allow West Central to contend in the Lincoln Trail Conference and make a deep run in the postseason.
   
 "I feel bad for our freshmen because they were excited for their first high school baseball season," Leath said. "The sophomores and juniors put in a lot of work to get better, too. It's a bad deal all the way around."
   
 "There were some questions at the end of last year about what was going to happen with the seniors we had coming back and how the freshmen would adjust jumping into high school baseball. We had really high hopes with the amount of talent we had," Bigger said. "The numbers were the most we have had since I have been in high school. We felt like we were going to have a really good year and be successful in Class 1A."
   
 Instead, Bigger has been working out in the family's home and backyard with his brother, West Central freshman Bryce Bigger.
   
 "I'm trying to keep my arm in shape, whether that be playing catch with my younger brother or hitting off a tee into a net in our basement," Bigger said. "I was trying to do all the little things to keep everything sharp in case the call was made."
   
 Bigger, who got his first taste of playing baseball at a tee-ball league in Gladstone, had played baseball every spring and summer since, including playing on an American Legion team in Monmouth the last two summers.
   
 Now, Bigger and Leath are busy trying to get Bigger's name and highlights out to college coaches, trying to land him a chance to play college baseball in a time of uncertainty.
   
 Bigger, who throws in the upper-80s, is hoping to get a chance to play at the next level while pursuing a degree in special education.
   
 "I am continuing to work on getting better at pitching and hitting and get my name out there on a couple of recruiting sites," said Bigger, who was also a standout football and basketball player at West Central. "At the beginning of the year Coach Leath said the coaches out there were going to be looking at me at the year goes along. That didn't work out, so now we are trying to do some different things to get my name out there for college coaches."

BALTIMORE (AP) — As the coronavirus rampaged across the U.S. economy, it slashed a cruel path of job losses, reduced hours and hardships for America's most vulnerable workers.
 The 20.5 million jobs lost in April fell disproportionately on African Americans, Latinos, low-wage workers and people with no college education. Friday's jobs report from the government — the worst on record — exposed the deep seams of inequality within the world's wealthiest nation and the threat they pose to an eventual economic recovery.
 The paradox is that if the economy is to fully bounce back, those same workers will need to be restored to jobs at restaurants, hotels, offices, factories, warehouses, medical facilities and construction sites. The flow of commerce hinges on their ability to deliver packages, cook meals, run clinics, provide public transportation and clean and maintain buildings. And their income, though typically low, supports the consumer spending that fuels most U.S. economic activity.
 "This represents a huge loss for the productive capacity of the economy," said Stephanie Aaronson, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "The economy is smaller and grows much less quickly when these workers are isolated from employment."
 African Americans are more likely to die from the virus. Latinos and non- college graduates are heavily concentrated in low-wage occupations, including jobs that have helped keep the nation fed and safe during the pandemic. Those groups were also among the first to lose their jobs as the economy crashed at a speed unrivaled in modern American history.
 For April, while the overall U.S. unemployment reached 14.7%, the rate for African Americans was 16.7%. For Latinos, it was an all-time high of 18.9%. For workers with only a high school diploma, a record 17.3%. For immigrants, 16.5%.
 By contrast, the unemployment rate for white Americans was 14.2%. And just 8.4% of college graduates — who often enjoy the flexibility to work from home — were unemployed.
 Latinos likely suffered disproportionately from the layoffs because they are more likely to work in the leisure and hospitality sectors — at hotels, restaurants and bars — where job cuts have been especially brutal, noted Gbenga Ajilore, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.
 "This shows that when the economy recovers, we have to be intentional about tackling the structural barriers that limit the employment outcomes of these groups," Ajilore said.
 The vast magnitude of the layoffs has laid bare the inequalities that endured long before the viral outbreak.
 President Donald Trump frequently highlighted the job gains achieved by minorities during his first three years in office, pointing to them as evidence that his administration was bridging the nation's wealth gap. But the pandemic has shown that the 11-year expansion did not provide much financial cushion to these workers, many of whom are now struggling to buy food and pay their housing bills.
 Among them is Erika Romero, a native of El Salvador who abruptly lost her job last month as a janitor at the Postal Square Building in Washington. Romero was left without health insurance or the ability to pay most of the monthly mortgage on the Maryland home she shares with her husband, their two daughters, her adult son and both sets of grandparents.
 Her husband had his daytime job reduced to three days a week, and his overnight cleaning job was cut. She has received one unemployment check so far, not nearly enough to support her substantial family.
 "Where am I going to look for work in this epidemic?" said Romero, who lives in the United States on a temporary protected status after an earthquake struck El Salvador. "It's just unfair."
 More than 100 members of Romero's union have died of the coronavirus, and 20,000 others have lost jobs, according to the local Service Employees International Union, which represents 175,000 janitors, security guards, doormen and other property service workers. Many lack legal status in the United States, said Jaime Contreras, vice president of the local union.
 "Those workers can't apply for unemployment," he said. "They don't get the stimulus money. They are left in the dark. To me, that is a huge mistake because this pandemic knows no legal status."
 Seven of the country's top cleaning companies are pushing Congress for payroll protection in the form of grants and tax credits. They warn that it could take weeks or months to rebuild their workforce at the very time when demand for professional cleaning could surge as schools, stadiums, gyms and other public spaces re-open.
 "The last thing we want to do is have to rebuild the skilled network back up just as we get more demand," said Josh Feinberg, chief strategy officer for ABM Industries, a contract cleaning company.
 Many minorities who work in the construction sector and restaurant industry, for example, have developed specialized skill sets. Last month, construction companies cut a stunning 975,000 workers, a record monthly loss.
 At the same time, retailers cut 2.1 million jobs. Administration and waste services dropped 1.5 million. Restaurants and bars shed an unprecedented 5.5 million jobs.
 Alex Tellez was working as a bartender and server at a Chicago steakhouse when he was told by a manager in mid-March to file for unemployment aid. Born in Mexico, Tellez had steadily moved up in the restaurant industry over 23 years, earning up to $60,000 year to support his wife and two daughters, ages 3 and 5. But now he has fallen several thousand dollars into credit card debt to support his immediate and extended family.
 Tellez, 43, is considering a career change. He doesn't see how the restaurant industry can survive a future with social distancing rules and precautions in place indefinitely.
 "As a bartender, I can't serve you unless you're one or two feet away from me," he said. "It breaks my heart that I might have to leave. I love being in the industry. It's a passion of mine."

Both Trump and Pence are now tested daily, and both tested negative after the latest infections were discovered. Staff members in proximity to them are also tested daily, as are guests. Congressional Republicans who visited Trump on Friday were spaced out around the table.
 Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, told reporters that “we’ve put in some additional protocols over the last 48 hours” to reduce the risk and expressed confidence that the president could be protected. “This is probably the safest place that you can come to,” he said.
 But neither Trump nor Pence regularly wears a mask, nor do most of their aides. The president hosted a wreath-laying ceremony at the World War II Memorial in Washington on Friday to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany by inviting several veterans ages 95 and over, even though they were in the most vulnerable age group.
 The latest positive test further rattled a White House already on edge after the president’s military valet came down with the virus. Katie Miller, the vice president’s press secretary and a top spokeswoman for the White House coronavirus efforts, had tested negative Thursday but then tested positive Friday morning.
 The result forced Pence’s scheduled flight to Des Moines, Iowa, to be delayed for more than an hour, even though she was not traveling with him, so that six other aides who had been in contact with her could be escorted from the plane at Joint Base Andrews before its departure. All six later tested negative but were sent home out of caution, officials said. Miller is married to Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser, and he too was tested again Friday and the results came back negative.
 White House officials initially asked reporters not to identify Miller as the aide who tested positive, but Trump blew the secret when he identified her publicly during his meeting with the congressional Republicans as “Katie” and “the press person” for Pence.

“How quickly can more stores open? How will Canadian players manage the derivative products rollout? Which businesses might fall by the wayside in a crowded industry facing capital scarcity?
 “While these questions remain relevant, COVID-19 has added another challenge to an industry with no shortage of them.”
 CIBC Capital Markets cut its cannabis sales forecast for 2020 by a billion dollars — down to $2.5 billion from $3.4 billion. And 2021 is down from $4.1 billion to $5.5 billion.
 The Canadian cannabis market was expected to be propelled this year by a wave of cannabis stores opening in Ontario, as well as Quebec and B.C. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed that growth.
 Not enough strains
 Some of the more popular and prolific cannabis strains are lacking in Canada, something the report notes.
 Tight restrictions on importing and sourcing genetics are partly to blame for the market falling shy of CIBC’s projections.
 GMO Cookies, Original Glue, Gelato 33, Mimosa, Purple Punch, Watermelon OG, Wedding Cake, Blueberry Muffin, Do-Si-Do, and Gary Payton are trendy and popular, but are unavailable or in short supply here.
 “Some investors or industry observers may laugh at the nature of these names, but they’re an important part of cannabis culture, and they appeal to high- frequency consumers,” says the report.

On the other hand, the film suspends us in an attitude of uneasy humour about Catherine’s destiny. This strategy primarily manifests in the figure of Marlene Dietrich, an icon of screen irony. The viewer never once believes in the innocence of Christina even back in Prussia as a young maiden. Dietrich plays up the plain country girl stereotype, feigning wide-eyed naïveté and real love. Starting from this, The Scarlet Empress effects a progressive ‘defeminisation’ of Catherine, her billowing white frock slowly giving way to military furs and finally to a dazzling white uniform with coat and trousers. Catherine’s rise to power thus coincides with a merging of the character with the Dietrich persona. The actor conveys Catherine’s sexual maturity with tremendous humour and wit. The joke on paper (that Catherine the Great slept with the whole Russian army) is taken through all its variations by Dietrich’s actorly intelligence, her manner of introducing wholly gratuitous but suggestive sentence breaks (“And your duties… Dmitri?”) and her typical way of sizing up men around her.

However, shouting, roaring and celebrating when your team scores has the potential to spread a lot of virus. As for regular hand- washing, well it’s fair to say that the sinks in places such as Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium don’t get used quite as much as they perhaps should.

Wolf, a Democrat, announced plans to reopen the southwestern corner of the state, with the exception of Beaver County, the following day.
 King said there was no “permanency” in the announcement that would guarantee Harrisburg won’t declare the affected counties “red” again, re-closing businesses deemed non-life-sustaining. Plaintiffs in the case include a number of businesses shuttered by Wolf’s order, plus GOP politicians whose districts include parts of Butler County – U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly and state Reps. Daryl Metcalf, Marci Mustello and Tim Bonner.
 Wolf’s office didn’t provide comment on the lawsuit by press time. But late on Friday, the state Department of Community and Economic Development released information regarding the more than 6,000 waivers and other measures that allowed some businesses to operate.
 “Pennsylvania is home to nearly one million small businesses, and while protecting public health and safety was our number one priority throughout this process, the administration recognized that businesses not identified as life-sustaining warranted the opportunity to operate in some capacity if they could offer life-sustaining services,” said DCED Secretary Dennis Davin. “Throughout this process, our primary focus was on reviewing exemption applications and assisting businesses with their questions and concerns, all in service of the goal of protecting public health in the face of an unprecedented and quickly evolving public health emergency.”
 Separately from the lawsuit, Greene County District Attorney Dave Russo said on Thursday that he doesn’t intend to prosecute businesses that reopen starting Monday, if they use personal protective measures for employees and customers, practice social distancing and otherwise follow guidelines from public health officials.
 “My policy decision is based on allowing these small businesses to practice the same procedures as the large conglomerates are,” Russo said.
 Wolf urged businesses in the red areas to keep following the state order. He said during a press conference that he understood owners’ frustration.
