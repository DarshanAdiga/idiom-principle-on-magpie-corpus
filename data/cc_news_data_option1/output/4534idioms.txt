_- After the match, Jake Roberts tells Garrison to hit the road. Garrison starts going after Lance Archer, but that doesn't work out well as Archer destroys him. He does the same to Dominguez. Jake claims he'll give Eddie Kingston's mother a DDT to get Archer a shot at the AEW World title. Jake is a madman, and he's so great at it. Archer also takes a shot at Kingston's mom, and I'm pretty sure a future Kingston vs. Archer match is gonna be pure destruction. Archer claims he's gonna go after Butcher, Blade, Penta, Fenix, and he may even bounce the Bunny if he needs to. This was an AWESOME promo._

Williston Basin International Airport has opened its new crosswind runway to aircraft operations, adding one more benefit and safety feature to the facility.
 City Commissioners Tate Cymbaluk and Chris Brostuen joined Airport Director Anthony Dudas and Overland Aviation President Tanner Overland for the runway’s unveiling on Thursday, Nov 5. Dudas said the new 4,500 foot crosswind runway is integral piece for allowing safe operations for smaller aircraft during high wind conditions that are perpendicular to the primary runway.
 Typically large commercial aircraft are not affected by these weather conditions, however smaller aircraft are not able to operate unless they are able to land facing into the wind.
 “XWA’s new crosswind runway will greatly benefit safe operations for small aircraft like medevac, cargo, and business operators during windy conditions,” Dudas told the Williston Herald. “These aircraft are more susceptible to strong winds and this runway will allow them to land safely during these conditions. This $12.7 million piece of critical airport infrastructure was paid 100 percent by FAA grant funding made possible through the recent federal CARES Act. Typically, this project would have been paid 90 percent by FAA and 10 percent by local sources. Our team is excited to continue to enhance aircraft operational safety at XWA.”
 Brostuen and Cymbaluk then took to the sky for the first flight from the new runway. The airport has had many projects and programs in the works over the last few months, including updating signage and lighting along the county road leading to the terminal. New monument signage has been added both along the highway and to the facility’s entrance to not only make the airport easier to find, but enhance the exterior aesthetic.
 Working with the TSA, the airport also recently introduced the XWA PASS program, designed to allow people who are non-ticketed to get through the security checkpoint and take advantage of the amenities that are offered at XWA. The pass grants access to greet friends and family arriving on domestic flights; accompany traveling family members and friends to their gates; shop and dine at the restaurant and store post-security; watch arriving and departing aircraft; and participate in XWA-sponsored events.
 To find out more about what's happening at XWA and Overland Aviation and to stay up-to-date on the latest projects, visit flywilliston.net or follow the airport on Facebook at facebook.com/flywillistonXWA, or Overland Aviation at overlandaviation.com and facebook.com/overlandaviation.

“Once it is released, hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are going to be the priority,” he said. “They will work with local public health, pharmacies, in terms of rolling that out. More than likely it would be two doses. I wouldn’t hold your breath until December because you might not survive, but it could be a Christmas present worth giving if you’ve got friends around. There’s still a lot of things to happen between now and then.”
 Vold said Public Health has also been in communication with the Royalton School District, as it is currently without a school nurse. The district has worked with the Little Falls School District for support and has requested additional aid from Public Health until it is able to get the nursing position filled. Vold anticipated that would likely happen the week after Thanksgiving.
 The Board confirmed it had no issues with Public Health having a nurse available to help the district on a part-time basis. The nurse would be able to supply medications and sign off on health plans.
 “I think that would be a great idea,” said Commissioner Mike Wilson. “I think there’s a lot of challenges all over the place and I think if we can help, we need to help.”
 The Royalton School District is currently using a hybrid learning model in which pre-K through grade 4 are in class full-time and grades 5-12 are hybrid at two days per week of in-class learning.
 Vold added that the biggest challenge for schools related to COVID-19 has been to have enough staff.
 “That’s really been the factor for why Little Falls went to distance learning,” he said. “They have staffing issues. I just got another email from Pierz, who were having staffing issues so they have to cut back on their in- person teaching because they just don’t have the staff. In terms of kids, we’re usually in between 20 and 30 kids countywide who are in that 14-day case rate data. So, not a lot of kids. What we’re seeing is that the transmission generally has not been happening in the school building. It’s been happening in the community or between families.”

“Focusing on the future and key projects, this tax increase will enable us to deliver on some high priority community initiatives while driving continued improvements to our services, one being the Mary Yardley footbridge,” said Johnson. “We continue to apply for grants to complete the North Main Street sidewalk, some of which have required matches from the borough. Acquiring the PECO lot in Morgan Avenue would increase our open space benefiting our CRS program and minimizing new construction in the floodplain.
 “Looking beyond 2021 we would like to complete the North Main Street sidewalk to Dolington Road and continue to look for ways to expand and upgrade borough hall,” said Johnson.
 Yardley Borough residents have not seen a municipal tax increase since 2017.
 After listening to the presentation, Councilman John McCann raised a number of concerns with the spending plan, including raising taxes for capital projects during a pandemic
 “I myself am not struggling, but I know many in the community are,” said McCann. “I know something like a tax hike at this time will be alarming to some. I have reservations about that, especially while we are fundraising for a public works project (the Mary Yardley bridge replacement project) and then raising taxes on top of it. I worry about the message that sends to the community in the midst of fundraising efforts.
 “I support all the projects. I think they are all important,” McCann said of the projects outlined in the spending plan. “Maybe the line of credit could help us with some of these projects,” he said, referencing a line of credit the borough has with First National Bank of Newtown.
 “If we’re going to raise taxes, perhaps this is the time to get rid of the per capita tax,” he continued, rattling off another idea. “The occupation tax is cumbersome to collect. Maybe people would be willing to support this if that were on the table.”
 Councilman Matt Curtin echoed much of what McCann said while commending Johnson for the work the borough’s administration has put into the budget.
 “I feel as though the mileage (increase) for the general fund feels necessary to continue to fund operations effectively,” said Curtain, but added, “It’s reasonable to debate the timing for adding a tax for capital projects during a pandemic. There’s also the thought of using some of the debt we have access to at a low cost and potentially funding those projects with revenue later.
 “I, too, had the idea of getting rid of the nuisance taxes, because people would benefit from having those gone,” added Curtin, but noted, “We’re limited as a borough on the methods and ways we can tax people. And those taxes are currently grandfathered so if we did get rid of them it’s a revenue we can never bring back again. Those are my thoughts, but it’s a reasonable discussion we should all have openly.”
 Councilman Uri Feiner added that “nobody likes to raise taxes. We have to be very diligent about cost. But you can’t avoid inflation and if you don’t raise taxes you create a situation of not being responsible. It’s the responsible thing to do. It sucks that it’s during a pandemic, but we’re not doing the community a favor by kicking that can down the road because it catches up with us and what you don’t collect this year, next year you have a bigger problem. We have to do the responsible thing.”
 The budget will be available for review at borough hall and on the borough’s website for public review. Council is tentatively scheduled to pass a final passage at its first meeting in December.

 In a speech written by his longtime aide and biographer, Mark Salter, McCain said it was time for the country to move beyond the scourge of racism and to unite.
 “I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our goodwill and earnest effort to find ways to come together,” McCain said, “to find the necessary compromises, to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.”

But then there seems to be some dissonance recently with a number of the new moves the Caretaker Committee is hinting as. First is the emerging fact that the Caretaker Committee is joggling with the idea of a tenure extension as against its mandate of six months. This naturally should raise some dust from certain blocs within the party and such an extension might be called out as a sit tight syndrome. After all, Buni would remain as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, calling the shots within the ruling party, this truly can be alluring but then it has or portends to have a damaging effect on the party’s present situation. However, let us ask if six months is truly enough to ensure a total reconciliation? A party with juggernauts will surely contend for every advantage, every inch and every structure that exists within the party, thus reconciling them will take much more than the norm. Again, given the fact that the CECPC was also busy with the Edo and Ondo elections as well as was responsive to its administrative duties , then it might be ok to tilt a bit to its body language for an extension.

The Democrats are the leftist party now. The ideas they espouse are so bad that they were relegated to obscurity with fringe candidates in the Communist Party USA for years. Now, these ideas are mainstream in the Democrat Party. These are no longer people we can debate in good faith with disagreements like tax rates, trade policy and Social Security. This is the woke left. This is the party that has been bought and paid for by the Marxist BLM organization. Having a slightly reduced majority in the House or failing to retake the Senate does nothing to change their direction. On the contrary, AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rasheeda Tlaib and countless others won their reelection battles, and they will be back with a vengeance. The "fresh, new faces" of 2018 are now the veterans of the phony Trump resistance. And unlike Pelosi, they care very little about the accumulation of personal power or wealth in the near term. Their eyes are on the bigger prizes of wealth and power heretofore unseen in the United States of America once we fall to Marxism.

Germany reported 21,506 new coronavirus infections within 24 hours -- the highest daily case number since the outbreak of the pandemic. The country also registered 166 new virus-related deaths, bringing the total death toll to 11,096, according to the country’s center for disease prevention, Robert-Koch-Institute.

 The number of people hospitalized began a slow rise in mid-September, followed by steeper and steeper hikes, something Pritzker noted in a Thursday news conference.
 “We have more than doubled the number of people in our hospital system with this disease in just about five weeks, with no sign of slowing,” he said.

Winless on the PGA Tour, the 24-year-old Burns also took a two-shot lead into the weekend in the season-opening Safeway Championship in September. He ended up tying for seventh that week at Silverado.
 "I think slowing down a little bit, really talking through the shot with Travis (caddie Perkins) and making sure we have a clear picture of what we're trying to do," Burns said. "I think that was really helpful to learn that."
 Carlos Ortiz of Mexico had a 68 to match Day at 5 under.
 First-round leader Brandt Snedeker followed his opening 65 with a 71 to drop into a tie for fourth at 4 under with Dawie van der Walt (66), Corey Conners (67), Aaron Wise (66) and Patton Kizzire (67).
 "Didn't drive it as good today as I did yesterday and that's going to put you behind the 8-ball here," Snedeker said.
 Top-ranked Dustin Johnson followed an opening 72 with a 66 to get to 2 under in his return after a positive coronavirus test knocked him out of the CJ Cup and Zozo Championship.
 "It was very solid today," Johnson said. " I felt like I played pretty well yesterday, just a little rusty. ... I swung it pretty well, just hit a couple bad iron shots. But I think that was more just from not trusting what I was doing, just from not being out there. But today did a lot better, hit a lot of really nice iron shots and felt like I managed my game very well, drove it well, hit a lot of quality shots."

The report compares surpluses to those from 2019 from various areas of the district's overall budget. Generally, operating expenses for the year were down from their projected amount. Property tax requisitions and other sources of revenue for the district remained generally stable. The surpluses are generally due to less spending across the board because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the slow down of activity, money allocated to certain projects was not spent how it was expected, which contributes to the surplus.

 Initially out of the picture, Essential Quality regrouped for a signature win that may set him up for a big 2021.
 Essential Quality took charge in the stretch to overtake 94-1 long shot Hot Rod Charlie and win Friday's $2 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile by three- quarters of a length on the first day of the season-ending world championships at Keeneland.
 Hot Rod Charlie and 4-5 favorite Jackie's Warrior dueled through the final turn before Essential Quality, initially off the pace after an early bump, recovered and emerged from a four-wide pack. The colt held on at the wire as Keepmeinmind, a 30-1 long shot, made a late charge. Essential Quality improved to 3-0 and established himself as a possible contender in next year's Kentucky Derby.
 Jockey Luis Saez earned his first Breeders' Cup win and was grateful for his mount.
 "To be here and to have it with this horse, it's very special," he said. "First time that I ride him, I knew he was going to be a super horse."

“Second, Mr. Turner believes that he received permission from at least one Dodgers employee to return to the field to participate in a photograph. Although Mr. Turner’s belief may have been the product of a miscommunication, at least two Dodgers employees said nothing to Mr. Turner as he made his way to the field, which they admitted may have created the impression that his conduct was acceptable.
 “Third, during the somewhat chaotic situation on the field, Mr. Turner was incorrectly told by an unidentified person that other players had tested positive, creating the impression in Mr. Turner’s mind that he was being singled out for isolation. Finally, Major League Baseball could have handled the situation more effectively. For example, in retrospect, a security person should have been assigned to monitor Mr. Turner when he was asked to isolate, and Mr. Turner should have been transported from the stadium to the hotel more promptly.”
 Manfred said he spoke with Turner and “I am closing this matter by applauding Justin for accepting responsibility, apologizing and making a commitment to set a positive example going forward.”
 Turner said he watched the final two innings with his wife Kourtney in a doctor’s office in the clubhouse and he assumed there was no objection by Dodgers officials to his returning to the field. He also said that when he returned to the field, he thought few people would be there and his plan was to take a quick photo with his wife.
 “However, what was intended to be a photo capturing the two of us turned into several greetings and photos where I briefly and unwisely removed my mask,” Turner said in a statement. “In hindsight, I should have waited until the field was clear of others to take that photo with my wife. I sincerely apologize to everyone on the field for failing to appreciate the risks of returning to the field. I have spoken with almost every teammate, coach, and staff member, and my intentions were never to make anyone uncomfortable or put anyone at further risk.”

Before the slate even opened this weekend, COVID-19 already claimed two of the conference’s six games, with Utah and Arizona the latest to declare a no- contest on Friday. It was a reminder that the specter of the virus is sure to loom from now through Dec. 19, when a Pac-12 champion is scheduled to be crowned.
 With the rest of the conference rebuilding, USC should contend for that title, assuming it first defeats Arizona State.
 But unlike in past seasons, it takes just one slip-up — on or off-the-field — for the rug to be pulled out from under a Pac-12 contender.
 “If you want to win a championship, you’re gonna have to look at perfection,” Helton said. “If you get caught up looking at what’s three, four, five, six, seven weeks down the road and not focus on what’s right in front of you, you can look up and get your butt beat.

Anyone who went for a test drive in one of these fishbowls on an oppressively hot day in mid-July, would think twice before signing an order! The interiors were like ovens in the summer heat, unless perhaps you lived in the far Northern states along the Canadian border. If automobile air conditioning had been more advanced in 1955, it may have been a different story. While Ford’s biggest rival, Chevrolet, offered air conditioning on their 1955, V8-equipped models, Ford didn’t offer air conditioning until 1958. Debuting at a hefty $395 (equal to $3,852 in 2020 monies), the number of 1958 Fords so equipped, was scant to say the least.

Coming into the Wolves’ volleyball match against Zimmerman, the youthful Milaca team was desperate for a win. Fresh off a 3-0 loss to Mora on Oct. 27, Milaca sat winless on the season.
 The Wolves played with that desperation as they dominated the Thunder on the way to their first win of the year by a 3-0 score on Oct. 29.
 Senior Brooke Rensenbrink was ecstatic to have the team snap the losing streak. “It was amazing, we all came together finally and we all supported each other,” she said.
 Milaca came out playing with energy and carried that to a 25-12 opening set win to grab a 1-0 lead. Rensenbrink thought the team’s drive was the difference in the match. “Our energy was way up and we built on energy with each other, I think that is what helped up win,” Rensenbrink said.
 Head Coach James Taylor agreed with Rensenbrink’s take on the team playing with energy adding that the girls learning they could keep playing gave them a jolt. “After we found out we got to play next week during our practice on Wednesday, the whole mood in the gym switched. The girls got loud, they got competitive and it was the loudest best practice we had all year and we carried it into the game,” Taylor said. The team was unsure if it would be able to play moving forward due to COVID-19 guidelines from the Minnesota State High School League.
 The team kept playing with a liveliness as it coasted to a 25-11 win in the second set. The Wolves finished off the Thunder, 25-15 to complete the 3-0 win and secure their first win of the year.
 Paige Maurer had a solid game as she got low for nine digs while picking up four serving aces. Mae Concannon led with eight kills with Macy Mach chipping in 14 assist.
 Milaca now sits at 1-3 while Zimmerman is 0-4.
 After the win, Taylor and the Wolves are aiming to keep the momentum moving. “We will build on it. We saw some better hitting against Zimmerman, things are looking better,” he said.
 With the season still on for the Wolves, the team will now head to Little Falls for a rematch against the Flyers in their next contest.
 As the season continues, Taylor wouldn’t want to be coaching any other group of players heading into their next match ups. “This is the team we want to keep taking forward. It’s no easy task, our conference is tough. This kind of attitude will carry us,” he said.
 Milaca hit the road to play the Flyers on Nov. 5.

Johnson said revenue is down across the board from real estate transfer taxes, fines and violations, special police services, building permit fees and contributions from private sectors.
 “We have deferred expenses that were budgeted in 2020 to 2021, including the roof on the annex building, replacement of doors on borough hall, additional maintenance and upkeep of Borough Hall, the Mary Yardley Footbridge replacement project, North Main Street sidewalks and a new police vehicle.”
 To make up the deficit and to build89 up the borough’s capital reserve fund, the budget contains four additional mills for 2021, with two mills going to the general fund, which supports day-to-day operations, including police, administration, legal, zoning and planning, public works, upgrades to borough hall, fixing the roof of the annex building and purchase of a new police car, and two mills, or about $70,000, allocated to its capital reserve fund for future projects.
 “It was just a few short years ago that our capital reserve fund balance was just over $64,000 and we did not have an emergency fund. In 2018 and 2019 we have been able to build up our savings and start a much needed emergency fund. Our current balance is just over $141,000 and capital reserve has just over $196,000.”
 The increase would boost millage rates in the borough from 24.73 to 28.73 mills with each mill equating to $35,004.
 That would mean a resident with a property assessed at the borough’s average of $27,644 would see their taxes increase by $110.57, from $683.64 to $794.21.
 This would put $55.29 per household into the general fund and $55.28 per household into the capital reserve account.
 Of the 28.73 mills, equalling just over $1,005,000, 22.66 mills are earmarked for general purposes with the remaining 6.07 mills allocated toward dedicated funds, including fire protection, street improvements, street lighting, ambulance and rescue squad, recreation and capital reserve with the new two mills.
 On the expenditure side of the ledger, Johnson said public safety makes up the biggest part of the budget pie followed by executive, legal, engineering, etc.
