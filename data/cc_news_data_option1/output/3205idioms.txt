Perhaps Shizuoka, in third place, was a bit of a surprise in light of its proximity to the capital region. One survey taker commented that while Shizuoka residents are indeed "laid-back, they do tend to speak quite quickly." Given the stated tendency to equate less urban areas with people having better personalities, one respondent suggested that its high ranking could perhaps partially be attributed to the fact that a large portion of its area is designated as national or natural parks. However, note that neighboring Yamanashi, which shares Mt. Fuji with Shizuoka, has even more of its area designed as national parks-and it came in dead last in the rankings.

When the effort by the Axis to enslave the planet was defeated, it set off the biggest celebration in all of humanity’s long history.

 Tens of millions lay dead in Europe and Asia, on battlefields, at sea, in bombed cities, in extermination camps.

Ice blasting with explosives before the spring breakup of river sections is a preventive measure for ice flooding. Based on 496 datasets on ice cover blasting with No. 2 emulsion rock explosives measured in the Mohe reach of the Heilongjiang River from 2015 to 2018, we analyzed the relationships between the blasting-crater diameter and water depth below the ice and between the blasting-crater diameter and the explosive-placement depth below the ice. Further, we analyzed the functional relationship between the explosive weight of a single blast hole and the blasting-crater diameter. Based on the above analysis we proposed an equation to calculate the minimum blasting cost for the same blasting effect. Using a 5-km section of the Heilongjiang River as an example, the proposed optimization method can save ~46% of the total blasting cost while achieving the same blasting effect. Through prototype observations of the Longdao Wharf and the Shengdan Village sections of the Mohe reach, Heilongjiang River, we confirmed that ice blasting can significantly accelerate the melting of ice. Moreover, data records showed that no significant ice-jam flooding has occurred in this section of the Heilongjiang River during the spring ice breakup period in the past five years of consecutive blasting.

New Delhi [India], Aug 14 (ANI): Ministry of Defence is organising Independence Day flag hoisting ceremony on Saturday at Red Fort maintaining the balance between the sanctity and dignity of the National function while factoring in precautions related to the COVID-19 scenario.   In order to facilitate seamless movement with the least chances of any crowding, seating enclosures and walkways are laid with wooden flooring and carpeting. Additional Door frame metal detectors, with adequately spaced markings, have been provided to avoid queuing and to ensure smooth passage for all the invitees. Most of the parking areas have been brick-lined and paved in order to ensure smooth entry and exit of vehicles to the maximum feasible extent.      The members of the Guard of Honour have been under quarantine to bring in safety. The guiding principle for seating has been "Do Gaz kiDoori" (or 6 feet between any two guests seated during the event.      The participation is only through invitation and members who do not have formal invites are requested to refrain from coming to the venue. About 4000 plus invites have been issued to officials, diplomats, members of public, media etc.      With an eye on safety, NCC cadets have been invited to witness the event (instead of young school children) and they will be seated at Gyanpath.      In order to sensitize the invitees towards COVID related safety measures, specific Advisory for following the COVID related guidelines has been issued along with each invitation card. A request card for the invitee to exhibit restraint and patience during dispersal after the conclusion of the function would be placed on each seat in this regard. The announcement in this connection will be made from the commentary booth from time to time.   The Traffic Police advisory will also contain a note on the matter. An orderly dispersal plan has been put in place for implementation through the controlling officials in various enclosures. In this regard, the cooperation of all invitees will be earnestly and consistently requested.      The ceremonial drills have also factored due to social distancing norms as well as other precautionary measures.      Adequate medical booths at four locations, 1 near the Rampart, 1 in Madhavdas Park and 2 in 15 August Park have been set up to cater to any attendee who is detected having any symptoms related to COVID-19 during entry. Ambulances would also be stationed at these four locations.      Thermal screening at all entry points for the invitees has been planned. Thorough sanitization of the premises inside and outside the Red Fort is being carried out on a regular basis.      All invitees have been requested to wear masks. In addition, an adequate number of suitable masks are being kept handy for distribution at various points of venue. Similarly, the availability of hand sanitizers at pre-defined locations has been done. The display boards are placed discreetly to attract the attention of invitees. (ANI)

A bakery that formerly called Gastonia home said it should be ready to open in its new Dallas digs next month.
   
 Cake Me Away Bakery owner Brittany Pressler said the bakery's new storefront, at 120 W. Trade St. right next door to the new Sammy's Restaurant & Pub of Dallas, is set to debut in mid-September.
   
 For Pressler and company, the new storefront has long been in the works and represents a return to normalcy after her company's last location, Chantilly's on Union Road, announced it was closing its doors for good in May.
   
 After launching her bakery downtown in 2014, Pressler took over Chantilly's tea room in 2015 and combined both businesses under the same roof in 2016.
   
 The emergence of COVID-19 and subsequent statewide stay-at-home orders forced major changes to those businesses however, including the closure of the tea room storefront.
   
 Since then, Pressler has been hosting periodic "pop up," baked good sales at the new location and working on renovating her new Dallas spot but said she's closing in on reopening her doors to the public.
   
 "I am very excited to get back to creating and producing custom orders and cakes," Pressler said.
   
 If you were a fan of Cake Me Away's strawberry champagne cakes, you'll find those in abundance, Pressler said, along with cherry lemon flavors which has proved to be popular at its pop up sales. There will also be cake slices, cheesecake slices, dessert bars, cookies and chocolate covered selections along with items for diet conscious diners.
   
 "We will be having some new cookie kits available to allow a delicious treat and a great hands on activity for home and social distancing," Pressler said. "We know the key to our move and striving through COVID will be adapting to challenges and open to adjusting what we can provide and how we provide our services as we pivot through the unknown of what the future holds for our community and other small businesses."
   
 Those looking for favorites from Chantilly's will find them, Pressler said, especially poppy seed muffins and strawberry butter.
   
 "We hope to find the right person at the right time for Chantilly's recipes and concept," at a new location under a new owner, Pressler said. "As of right now, we will be focusing on the opening of the bakery and getting our employees back into their jobs so we can start serving the community again."

For the beautiful game to be allowed to return at all was quite a coup for Scottish football. A decision that should have been treasured and protected.
 And let’s be clear, this is not the case for everyone. The overwhelming majority of players are doing everything absolutely right to limit the chances of unwittingly spreading the virus.
 But the two cases that have rocked the country - Bolingoli and the Aberdeen 8 - fly in the face of all the brilliant work that has been done to secure hundreds of people who work in football their livelihoods.
 The selfishness of Bolingoli in particular, to risk all of those jobs for the sake of a short break in Spain, is unforgiveable.
 Many Saints fans have taken to social media to ask why the game wasn’t forfeited, especially if a club can’t complete a fixture because of a rule break by one of their own players.
 Indeed, St Mirren did nothing wrong to contribute to the decision to call the game off so late in the day.
