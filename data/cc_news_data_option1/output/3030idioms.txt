  CHAMPAIGN -- What a weekend for Illinois men's basketball.


  Reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year Kofi Cockburn announced Saturday he is headed back to Illinois. The 7-foot center will return for his sophomore year and withdraw from the NBA Draft.


  He kept it simple, tweeting, \"I'M BACK!\"


  Cockburn's decision marks the second pivotal development for the Illini in as many days. Star guard Ayo Dosunmu's decision to remove himself from the NBA Draft and return to Champaign sent shockwaves through the college basketball world on Friday night.


  Back in April, Cockburn announced he would test the professional waters and enter the NBA Draft, but he did not hire an agent. His future remained up in the air as the NCAA's Aug. 3 deadline to stay or leave the draft approached.


  Now, one of the most promising Illini athletes in recent memory will be back to further build on his legacy. With the return of both Cockburn and Dosunmu, Illinois appears to be one of the best teams in the Big Ten moving forward.


  The conference is retaining much of its talent as players face difficult decisions with the NCAA's deadline falling before the NBA Combine, which still does not have a finalized date.


  Minnesota's Marcus Carr announced his return on Friday, and AP Player of the Year Luka Garza is still weighing his options at Iowa and with the NBA.


  But the Illini are loaded, adding big-time recruits Andre Curbelo and Adam Miller, the 2020 Illinois Mr. Basketball winner.


  Combine that with the return of Trent Frazier and Peoria native Da'Monte Williams for their senior seasons and capable third-year forward Giorgi Bezhanishvili, and the Illini are returning their most talented team since the run to the NCAA Championship in 2005.


  As a freshman, Cockburn trailed only Dosunmu (16.6 points per game) in scoring, averaging 13.3 points per game. He led the Illini on the boards, averaging 8.8 rebounds per game, ranking fourth in rebounding in the Big Ten and sixth among all NCAA freshmen.


  He was also named as Illinois' Freshman of the Year Award winner after athletic activities came to a halt in March.


  The Brooklyn native was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week seven times throughout the 2019-20 season. He was the only Illinois player to start all 31 games, as Dosunmu missed the Rutgers game on Feb. 15 due to injury.


  Cockburn charted 12 double-doubles on the year, which was the fifth highest total of any NCAA freshmen and it doubled the previous freshman record at Illinois. His 272 rebounds are more than any other freshman in school history.


  In the final moments of a 78-76 home win over No. 18 Iowa on March 8, four days before the season was stopped, Cockburn rejected AP Player of the Year Luka Garza's hurried shot seconds before the clock expired to seal the result.


  Cockburn pranced over to the Illinois bench with his arms raised in triumph before embracing teammates Benjamin Bosmans-Verdonk and Zach Griffith.


  For a while, it looked like that might have been the end of a quick, but prosperous Illini career for Cockburn. And now, in a span of less than 24 hours, both he and Dosunmu have decided to give it one more go.

FISHER: I think at the end of the day, Black voices are the most inspirational voices out there, especially right now, but I also think that white voices are still the most powerful. Systematic oppression is a very real thing. This is not a myth. You know, (laughter) like, this is a real thing that has existed for far too long. And I've found catharsis in, you know, being able to let that voice that's just yelling in my head, you know, that's in my heart - to be able to let that out, I found a lot of catharsis in that, and I'm very grateful for that.

Unfortunately, through the separation of screens and bandwidth, cables etc. we write things that we probably would never say face to face. We also read other’s words with our own filters and put our own


  take (which is often wrong) on what someone else has typed. No wonder our division is so strong these days. I cannot help but think that Jesus is doing a divine facepalm at our behavior. With a fair amount of confidence, I say that many of us have not witnessed our faith online. More often, I feel that sin gets the space rather than our faith. As the election draws nearer; I fear that things will only get worse.


  Unless, of course, we resist the urge to participate in the forces of evil that continue to divide us. Change can happen because with God all things are possible. Often the most difficult change to enact is the change of the self, but God will help with that too. If you go on social media go on with a prayer and the resolve not to fan flames. Years ago, we had the WWJD movement. I never liked it as I knew that I often cannot and could not do what Jesus does. However, I do use WWJS (what would Jesus say?) This, I believe, is the over- riding question we must use in all our engagements in the remainder of 2020. Odds are that he would say something far better than what we would.

So many things can happen in the span of a year. When I think about what we were doing last year, I can't help but long for some of those days compared to the last few months of being isolated because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  Last May, we were looking forward to my nephew Tyler's graduation from Watson Chapel High School and preparing for the college of his choice in Northwest Arkansas. His mom got us all matching T-shirts and we planned to sit together during the graduation at the Pine Bluff Convention Center.


   


  Getting together was no problem once we got to our seats. Staying together was a bit of a challenge afterward because of so many people being there. Not only did Watson Chapel have its commencement at the convention center, but so did Dollarway High School.


   


  I remember Tyler looked dashing in his cap and gown. His outfit would have been unique if he had kept on the shoes he wanted to wear. They weren't exactly kosher with the administration and he (as well as other students) had to change before the ceremony began.


   


  Later, while everyone was taking photos and deciding whether to go out to eat, I decided it was time to go home since I had worked earlier and was tired. Unfortunately, I was stuck. There were so many cars on the lot where I parked that I was blocked in on all sides. I had to wait at least 30 minutes before I could get out.


   


  The summer also brought anticipation of meeting a great-great-niece who would be born in July. Her mom, Ashlie, also designed special T-shirts for us to wear to her baby shower.


   


  The shower was decorated in pink and other colors and the centerpieces were baby unicorns. The gift table was overflowing with presents. We played games and enjoyed the refreshments, which were more than finger food. If memory serves me correctly, we had barbecue cooked by my nephew, Chris, and all the fixings. The cake was good too.


   


  Although the shower was for Ashlie, we all had a good time. It was one of the first showers I attended where men were there too. Alaya was born healthy with a head full of thick dark hair. This year, I missed her first birthday party, but I'm told her parents went all out to throw her a bash.


   


  Late last summer, I was also planning to visit my sister and her husband out west. We had thought about getting together on the week they celebrated their second wedding anniversary and traveling to a nearby state to see her kids and grand kids. Unfortunately, a last minute issue shoved our plans.


   


  I hadn't seen her in two years since she got married again after being alone more than 35 years. Before then, we hadn't seen each other in about 20 years, but we talked quite often by phone. Until the wedding, the last time I saw her kids they were still in high school. Now, the son has three boys and a girl and the daughter has three girls. All of these young people were nearly strangers to me, but there was still that familiar connection.


   


  My sister's daughter, Angel, had some health issues and was nearly blind. When I greeted her at the wedding, it was difficult for her to make out my face, but once she heard my voice she screamed in excitement. That was a good day.


   


  This year, the pandemic also put a damper on other events I wanted to attend here. My friend, Gigi, and I had planned to go to the salad luncheon and fashion show at St. John AME Church at Pine Bluff in the spring.


   


  I remember the first year I went. It was held on the same weekend as the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan. I spent the morning watching much of the wedding coverage on TV. Not only was the couple stunning, but the guests were too, especially the ladies in their hats.


   


  When Gigi and I arrived at the church for the luncheon, many of the women there also made fashion statements with their hats. However, the salads took the show. I don't know who made them all, but there were salads galore of all kinds.


   


  I was also looking forward to other programs this year such as the Biz Expo of the Pine Bluff Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Roaring 20's Gala of Southeast Arkansas College, the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Little Rock and various church programs, especially women's day services and conferences.


   


  One of the most significant gatherings I miss is getting together with the ladies of the birthday club who welcomed me with open arms after my husband died in 2014.


   


  I was trying to navigate life as a widow after having been married for most of my adult life. Although I had other friends, my sister-in-law and her friends allowed me to join their group and I've been blessed by learning so much from them.


   


  Whether it was advice about work and finances, the best places to shop or travel, enjoying grown folks' music or simply dining together and enjoying each other's company, it was all worthwhile. Maybe we'll get a chance to do it again soon.

“As a kid growing up in school, I’d do most anything to earn spending money,” he said.
 “I had a newspaper route with over 150 customers that I delivered before school. I mowed about a dozen yards in summer, even sold the Grit newspaper and sold flower seeds door to door. Those activities provided me the pleasure of owning those Cushman Scooters.
 After I had the 1947 Cushman for a while, I found a Cushman Eagle with a bigger engine that I drove everywhere, including Jackson, Ohio. I would even drive it to Riverside once a week.”
 Riverside raceway was once a combination drag strip and oval race track in Proctorville. On Friday nights during the racing season, Hypes would sneak through a secret entrance to watch the races on the oval track. On Sunday mornings, he would ride his Cushman over to the drag strip and drive around areas where the hot rods had been parked, finding tools and miscellaneous car parts left behind.
 “Before graduating from Fairland High School in 1973, I became known as the neighborhood repairman,” Hypes said. “Anything from lawnmowers and weed eaters — if it ran on gasoline, it ended up here for repair, and I enjoyed it.”
 Hypes went through a few cars before the MG obsession grew to its present size. The beautiful MG picture accompanying this story was the result of several years of fabrication, reconstruction, paint, wiring, upholstery and replaced running gear that includes a rebuilt engine. And it began with the discovery of two sad-looking MG bodies falling apart in a Scottown, Ohio, barn. The build required parts from both bodies to make that 1957 MGA the prize winner it is today.
 “I’m presently rebuilding a 1978 Triumph Spitfire,” Hypes said. “It takes hours to remove every part — that’s when the rust shows, when everything is removed. Each piece gets sandblasted and painted before putting it away until the car goes back together.”
 There’s another Triumph awaiting this guy’s touch, and still there are a couple of MG roadsters from the early 1950s hanging around. One looks like the heartbeat has long vanished, the other is more pleasing to the eye.
 Behind the scenes of all this mechanical wizardry is Teresa. They will celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary this September. When Charles was asked how he knew Teresa was the right one for him, he replied: “Because she told me she was.”

This has been a difficult time in our nation's history as we deal with two plagues that threaten our community and world. The first is the COVID-19 pandemic; the second is systemic racism. Both are insidious and rob us of life. In some ways, the pandemic has highlighted the racial and economic inequities in our nation.


  We've certainly learned quite a bit about our nation in these past few months, which tells a disturbing story of our failure as a society to confront racism and systemic structures of oppression. Access to healthcare, economic resources, technology and education is not equitable in our society. This is evident in disproportionately higher mortality rates for minorities, who often work in high-risk jobs, lack access to quality healthcare, and do not have the necessary resources to work remotely. College students, especially low-income and underrepresented minorities, already vulnerable before the pandemic, are at a greater risk due to these equity gaps.


  Advocating for social justice and equity are part of my DNA. I cannot stay silent in the face of injustice -- how can any of us? Silence is complicity. When we subject others to unjust treatment and violence, it diminishes our own humanity.


  Racism has plagued education in our country for centuries. It was illegal to teach slaves to read or write. Redlining, segregation, and similar discriminatory policies not only prevented equitable access to property and education, but also led to the underfunding of schools that served their communities. Throughout the years, these policies have increased the equity gap. Today, educational disparities still exist. There are disproportionate disciplinary actions taken against students of color, a lack of equitable access to resources in inner city schools, the labeling of children as "at risk," performance based funding, and standardized testing. This further adds to the divide by creating artificial barriers that disproportionately have a negative impact on the poor and underserved minority communities.


  As a society, we cannot endure unless we confront these and take decisive action.


  Today, historic racial discrimination still has lasting consequences, and its effect continues to impede some students from continuing to higher education. While community colleges work to combat this, they are not immune to the systemic structures of oppression and racism that plague our country. Yet, they have democratized education by making it more accessible to people barred from education, the poor, the underserved, immigrants, racial and ethnic minorities. Additionally, while community colleges enroll half of all undergraduates in the United States and by far serve a greater number of underrepresented students of color (35%) than any other sector in higher education, they still receive the lowest level of federal and state funding per student.


  Society cannot change unless we are willing to change, and change starts at home. I believe as an educational institution, we must lead the way in self- examination in order to effect change. The inequity we see in our higher education system must now, and forever, be banished. At QCC, we advocate for open and accessible education for all. We are inclusionary for all students, not exclusive for the privileged. Almost half of our students are students of color. Our classrooms are a rainbow of humanity, where people come not just to learn, but to dream of a better future. However, a recent survey of our students' ability to cope with the pandemic showed that over half often worry about paying bills and that at least one third of our students frequently worry about having enough to eat, a place to sleep, or access to the necessary technology to succeed. We have been finding ways to address these needs, keeping our food pantry and resource center available, offering comprehensive remote support services, and raising over $105,000 for a Student Emergency Fund to assist students with immediate life and educational needs. While this is making a difference, I fear that these numbers fall short of the true magnitude of the challenges our students face, and there is much more we must do.


  We are not alone in these concerns. The cost of education, institutionalized biases, and artificial barriers prevent many students across our nation from gaining access to the education that will prepare them to seek gainful employment and succeed. We must do more. No stone should be left unturned and no conversation, no matter how difficult, should go unspoken in our collective quest for equity.


  Equity agendas must go beyond police reform and must extend to all sectors of society. We cannot endure unless we confront the difficult challenges before us and take definitive action. We must be disrupters of systemic racism and recognize that there is no place in our society for implicit bias. The world is changing and education needs to be the driving force to make sure that it changes for the better. The time is now.

TAUNTON -- With little more than a month before the start of school, Taunton Public Schools has released a preliminary plan for the reopening of the district.


  Administrators released an over-40-page plan detailing everything from schedules to how cohorts of students will be organized to busing.


  But there are still many questions that need answering.


  According to Superintendent John Cabral, the preliminary plan calls for high needs students to be in-person four days a week from day one, but all other students will be fully remote for at least the first couple of months of school, at which point the district will re-assess the conditions on the grounds and determine whether to begin phased in hybrid learning.


  The hybrid model the district hopes to eventually be able to implement if conditions permit divides students into three cohorts: A, B and C. Cohort C will be made up of "high needs" children already identified through the individualized education program process -- namely students with cognitive or learning disabilities, students for whom English is a second language and students who are in foster care or homeless. These students will attend school in-person every weekday except for Wednesday.


  Cohort A will consist generally of all other students whose last name begins with the letters A through M, and they will attend in-person school on Monday and Tuesday and be remote the rest of the week. Cohort B will consist generally of all other students whose last name begins with the letters N through Z, and they will attend in-person school on Thursday and Friday and be remote the first half of the week.


  "The large voice of our task forces, talking to our principals and School Committee about these different options, we felt that this made the most sense for our community at this time," said Cabral. "It was the most practical way to go about this in order to provide instruction to all our students and have a continuity of learning."


  The district said Cohorts A and B won't be entirely based on names, as they will try to keep families together on the same days and will take schedules into account. Cabral also clarified that Wednesday was chosen as the all- remote day to make it so students would have a split week and wouldn't have to go back and forth between in-person and remote learning too much.


  Parents can choose to keep their children at home for entirely remote learning, and the district is expecting some parents to do so. The district is currently investing in a more robust and structured online learning platform using Google Classroom that will allow teachers to do things like upload assignments and instructional videos all in one place.


  "Some parents have expressed interest in homeschooling their children. I would encourage them to learn more about our remote learning plan to start the year. They may see that is a more viable option," he said.


  However, Cabral also said it "would be difficult" to allow parents whose children are not high needs to send their children to school more than the two planned in person days because of the need to maintain social distancing.


  The hybrid system won't go into effect right away. Every student other than those with high needs will begin the school year remotely. As teachers and students are educated on how to use all the new systems, the school will set a date to begin the hybrid in-person learning, at which point teachers will teach from their classrooms with all the resources they have there. Cabral said that having the year begin remotely will make transition to fully remote learning easier if the school is forced to shut down again.


  The new hybrid plan is not yet set in stone. Cabral said the district is still bargaining with the teacher's union, but that this is the system they are currently planning for. The state has required that districts have a firm plan by Aug. 10, but Cabral said they are hoping to get an extension to allow them more time into mid-August.


  A start date for the school year is also yet to be determined. The state has required schools start by Sept. 16, but Cabral said school leaders are currently reviewing their calendars and will make a recommendation to the school committee soon.


  Cabral acknowledged that the biggest downside of the hybrid plan is that it is the most disruptive of the three plans and that remote learning has been a struggle for Taunton so far.


  "Nothing replaces the benefits of full in-person learning, and we recognize that," he said.


  However, he said, it would be very difficult for the district to meet safety guidelines if they attempted full in-person learning, and that it would be much more costly. The cost of acquiring more buses alone to meet guidelines would have been steep.


  Many factors went into the decision to go with a hybrid model, Cabral said, but the findings of the school's social distancing tests were a major part. They determined that while a 3-foot social distancing requirement would allow all students to return, they still felt they should respect the 6-foot social distancing recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control. With the 6-foot requirement, Cabral said the schools would not be able to host all students for in-person learning.


  "The safety and well-being of students, staff and families will always be paramount. That's what's driving our decision-making," he said.


  On Thursday, the Massachusetts Teachers Association called for learning to continue remotely until it can be proven that school facilities meet all public safety standards, citing older school buildings with inadequate air systems as a potential danger to school communities. Cabral declined to comment on how this could affect decision-making.


  Additionally, the district considered the findings of their parent preference survey in creating their plan. The survey found that around half of parents wanted their children to return to school for in-person learning. Approximately 35 percent thought a hybrid model would be best, and only 15 percent preferred entirely remote learning.


  Cabral also said the input of his seven task forces which analyzed many reopening issues was highly influential.


  "I'm very proud of the way our educational community came together to do something that we believe is best for our kids," he said.


  The district's plan for busing calls for one child per seat, with alternating seating near the window and the aisle. This will decrease bus capacity to a third of its normal level.


  Cabral said the district is also working with city agencies to provide affordable daycare for families and will be establishing new ways to provide social and emotional support for students. School-provided breakfast and lunches will likely continue as well, although the district needs final approval from the state for funding, and Chromebooks will be provided for all students and teachers.


  The district is planning to keep extra-curricular activities, but is encouraging teachers to host them entirely or mostly remotely. School sports will follow the guidelines previously set out by the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association.


  It's been difficult to plan for the year with recent funding cuts, Cabral said, but the school has received additional grants that have eased the burden. And now that parents are aware of the school's plan, he said, the district can put its energy into successful implementation that will meet the needs of all students.


  "These are truly unprecedented times. I know my team, myself and our educational leaders will continue working very hard to do what's best for our students, staff and community," he said. "We feel that what we're putting forward makes sense and will work for our community."

CRANE, James Harrison April 3, 1941 - June 16, 2020 Our beloved Jim Crane passed away surrounded by family in Spokane, Washington at Sacred Heart Medical Center on June 16, 2020 from complications of Polymyositis, a very rare disease. Jim was born in Bellingham, Washington to Lloyd and Yona Crane on April 3, 1941. He lived and went to school in Alaska before moving to Spokane and attended Libby Junior High and graduated from Lewis and Clark High School. Jim went on to attend Columbia Basin College in Tri-Cities and then on to Chicago Tech and Eastern Washington State College graduating with Honors with degrees in Construction. As a young man he laid brick and saved his money for college. He also spent six years in the National Guard. Jim married the love of his life and high school sweetheart Nannette (Cunningham) Crane on September 17, 1966 and had two daughters, Kim and Kati. Jim owned Custom Masonry in Spokane for several years. He worked with Harold Balazs using Harold's decorative bricks on several buildings. Jim also laid the Eye of the Eagle on the Federal Building in Seattle, plus worked on many other projects including Expo 74 and condominiums in Kauai. Jim then went on to work for The Coeur d'Alenes Company until retiring in 2006. Jim was a Shriner and an avid WSU Cougar (Coug Dad) and Seahawks fan. He also loved bass fishing, golf, and breakfast with his golf "buddies" every Tuesday. He loved his yard and garden and placed 2nd in the Spokane garden contest. He loved entertaining and spending time with his family and friends. Jim was preceded in death by his parents, Lloyd and Yona Crane, in-laws Fred and Helen Cunningham, brother Bill, sister Jeanne, and several other loved family members and friends. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Nannette (Cunningham) Crane, his two children Kim Reber (Larry) and Kati Crane, and his three grandsons Harrison, Hayden and Jacob.

I needed to escape the noise but in my delirious mind I daren’t exit the front door as bad people would get me. So I tied my bed sheets to my kitchen table leg and tried to abseil out of the window.’


  From 30ft in the air Ruth crashed to the ground, breaking her back and both ankles. A neighbour heard the screams and called an ambulance.


  After an eight-hour operation on her back and a four-hour operation for each of the shattered ankles, Ruth was put into a full-body cast and was kept in intensive care for four days.


  When she woke up there, she was still in a manic state. ‘I was still delusional, I thought the doctors and nurses were going to kill me. I would be murdered in my bed.’


  Ruth spent a month in hospital before leaving in a wheelchair, with a doctor warning she might never walk again. But she proved them wrong and by working hard with physical therapy, within six months she was back on her feet, though she still limps today.


  Ruth also found a better psychiatrist, who took the time to talk to her, as well as involve her family to get to the bottom of what triggered her episodes.


  ‘He was very thorough, he went over my whole background, and included my family in the process. He helped me to organise a support system which is so essential for mental illness,’ explains Ruth. ‘Also, the medication improved over time.’


  Realising how ineffective her original psychiatrist had been, Ruth sued him in 1987 for mismanaging her case, and eventually received an out of court settlement. Happily, Ruth’s life was on the up.


  After the accident she turned her hand to painting, which was more of a passion than architecture had been. She found immersing herself in her art a soothing form of self-expression.

Portland protest peaceful after federal presence reduced


  PORTLAND, Ore. — More than a thousand people showed up in downtown Portland early Saturday to peacefully protest, about three days after the announcement that the presence of U.S. agents there would be reduced — a deal that Oregon officials hope will continue to ease tensions as the city tries to move on from months of chaotic nightly protests.


  Friday’s overnight protest mimicked that of Thursday, which was the first time in weeks that demonstrations ended without any major confrontations, violence or arrests. The change in tone outside a federal courthouse that’s become ground zero in clashes between demonstrators and federal agents came after the U.S. government began drawing down its forces in the liberal city under a deal between Democratic Gov. Kate Brown and the Trump administration.


  As of midnight on Saturday, no federal agents had emerged from the courthouse, which has been the center of protests for weeks, and there was no noticeable law enforcement presence surrounding the area.


  Chicago homicides and shootings rise sharply


  CHICAGO — Homicides and shootings have surged in Chicago during the first seven months of the year.


  From Jan. 1 through the end of July, there were 440 homicides in Chicago and 2,240 people shot, including many of those who were killed, according to statistics released Saturday by the police department.


  There were 290 homicides and 1,480 shootings, including people who were killed, in the first seven months of last year.


  July was especially violent, as the city recorded 105 homicides and 584 shootings. Among them was a 9-year-old boy who was killed Friday when someone opened fire in the direction of a number of people, including him and his friends, according to police.


  There were 308 shootings and 44 homicides in July 2019.


  Texas city commissioner killed by police during shootout


  MISSION, Texas — A Texas city commissioner was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire with police and a sheriff’s deputy who had responded to a domestic disturbance call at his home, authorities said.


  Officers who responded to the call late Thursday at Sullivan City Commissioner Gabriel Salinas’ home in Mission found his 39-year-old girlfriend with severe wounds caused by a knife or machete and her 4-year-old son with a head injury, said Robert Dominguez, the police chief in Mission, which sits along the Mexico border not far from Texas’ southern tip.


  They then encountered Salinas, 39, who opened fire, leading the officers to fire back, Dominguez said. Salinas barricaded himself inside the home and after several hours of failed attempts to contact him, officers sent in a robot that found him dead in a bedroom, the police chief said.


  The woman was critically wounded but was expected to recover. Her son was treated and released, said Dominguez, who didn’t immediately reply to a Saturday phone message seeking further information. He said an autopsy will determine whether Salinas was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

BAFFORD--Joseph Edmonds. Joseph Edmonds Bafford was born in Brooklyn, NY, on September 11th, 1933, to Joseph Harold Bafford and Mena Edmonds Bafford. He passed on July 23rd, 2020, at Southminster in Charlotte, NC. When he was 5 years old, the family moved to Lexington, NC, where Joe attended elementary and high school. During the summers, when he was in high school, Joe worked in peach orchards to earn money for college. He graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill, where he made Phi Beta Kappa, with a Degree in Business. He then went to Wharton earning an MBA and graduating 4th in his class. After Wharton, he joined the Army working in the Pentagon. Joe's first job was in a Think Tank at IBM in Poughkeepsie, NY, after which he was hired by White Weld. Joe's next position was Director of Institutional Sales at Merrill Lynch where he became a member of the Chairman's Club. He retired from Merrill Lynch after working there for 25 years. In 1965, Joe married Margaret Angeline Brand; they lived in Manhattan. Joe and Margaret's son, Joseph Edmonds Bafford, Jr., was born on June 1st, 1970, and their daughter, Margaret Angeline Brand Bafford, was born on April 6th, 1972. After living in Manhattan and summering in Bridgehampton for 50 years, they moved to Southminster in Charlotte, NC. Joe was a "scratch" golfer and an avid skier, a "powder hound", and his children remember wonderful ski trips all over the world, which they especially loved because Dad could not bring his phone with him on the slopes. Joe was a man who could capture a room full of people with his smile, sparkling eyes, and amazing sense of humor. Joe was predeceased by his parents and is survived by his devoted wife of 60 years, Margaret, and their loving children, Edmonds and his wife, Alexandra of Manhattan; and Angeline of Charleston, SC; as well as his sister, Roberta Bafford Partridge of Ballston Spa, NY. Other survivors include the Rockwell Poissons and Alfred Brands of Charlotte, NC, the Abel Brands of Bolivia, NC, as well as many nieces and nephews. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, there will be no memorial service at this time. In lieu of flowers, friends and family may send a donation to their favorite charity.

That is when Hazelton really blossomed according to Ruelas and Angers. He committed himself to football in his final season and led the Lakers back to Ford Field for another shot a state title.


  “The biggest thing I saw from him was his growth as a leader amongst his teammates,” Angers said. “There is no fear in him. He is going to do the right thing and there was never any fear from me on the sidelines watching him lead us in those situations.”


  His teammates noticed the difference in his leadership skills, as Ben Kroll noted he became more of a vocal leader that always held himself and his teammates accountable.


  “I was impressed with his growth and maturity the last couple of years — he became an exceptional leader as a senior,” Ruelas said. ”He held guys accountable and it made them want to play hard. They wanted to give it their all because they knew their leader was giving his.”


  The transformation the Hazelton underwent, both physically and mentally, was noticed by anyone who watched him compete. He earned All-state honorable mention as a sophomore, second team all-state as a junior and first team all- state as a senior. His progress was noticeable, even from afar.


  Hazelton often fell back on the work of his predecessors in his time at Glen Lake. Growing up and watching guys like O’brien, Peterson and Angers left a lasting impression on Hazelton — one he hopes to leave on those who follow him.


  Hazelton, who amassed eight varsity letters in four years (football, basketball, golf), said just growing up around the Glen Lake program bred success.


  “We have always had someone to look up to,” Hazelton said. ”I think that shows how to find success and what having someone ahead of you really means for success.”


  Hazelton found a lot of success as a Laker, reaching three state title games, but was never able to reach that pinnacle he was searching for. Hazelton is hoping his next step at Ferris State brings him one of those championship rings.


  However, he said his greatest accomplishment as a Laker was the leader he became, saying his teammates helped shape that persona over the course of his career.


  “I definitely feel like I left my mark,” Hazelton said. “I hope that a lot of the younger kids can look up to what I have done and see just how hard you need to work to get to that point. I just hope I was a good role model.”

"The vast majority of outbreaks are associated with indoor crowd settings, so pubs and nightclubs and things like that. The transmission rate outdoors is much, much lower.


  "The only issue with sports is the contact element of it, that's what's problematic.


  "We know that Covid can live on surfaces and no matter what you do, with football or hurling there is an element of risk to it.


  "The only thing I would say is there's been very little research done on the risk of transmitting in sport, so there is a big unknown there as well."


  Club Championship games are in full swing around the country with only 200 people currently allowed to go to matches, including players, referees and coaches.


  GAA President John Horan has called for that attendance limit to be increased and it is set to more than double to 500 on August 10, if phase 4 is given the green light by Government.


  Limited attendances will depend on coronavirus numbers - as has been the case in the UK - where plans for crowd trials this weekend were shelved by Boris Johnson's Government.


  5,000 racegoers had been due to attend the final day of Glorious Goodwood on Saturday before a last-minute U-turn due to spikes in cases.


  "As the guidelines evolve, we'll get to a stage of outdoor gatherings of several thousand people," Dr O'Tuathail added.


  "If you look at other countries in the EU, that's the way that they're going so I think it's inevitable that we will see that.


  "The outdoors does give that protective factor but obviously it's going to be very different and the 'craic factor' is going to be significantly reduced, because a lot of what makes GAA exciting is the large number of people hugging and being excited together.


  "It's going to be very clinical for the foreseeable future, which is unfortunate.


  "You're still going to have to put probably at least a metre between people, so that's going to reduce the capacity hugely."


  The All-Ireland hurling final is set for December 13 at Croke Park with the football decider being held six days later.


  And if fans around the country are watching in groups at home or in pubs, they'll be advised to keep the shouting to a minimum.


  O'Tuathail commented: "My experience in Dublin pubs and restaurants is that they're putting at least a metre between each group and people are complying, and I've felt safe the vast majority of the time.


  "When it comes to matches, what makes that a bit more difficult is that we know if you're shouting or singing you're producing larger amounts of droplets, and the risk is higher.


  "Obviously if there's an All-Ireland final on, everyone is shouting and that adds a bit of complexity to it. But at the moment if the rules are adhered to in pubs it is safe.


  "There are rural areas where there have been very few cases and all the pubs are shut, which makes no sense from a public health perspective at all.


  "I actually think we need to hit the nail on the head, open up the pubs and make sure the rules are strictly enforced, and there needs to be a body that does that, not the Gardai.


  "If restaurants and pubs aren't playing by the rules then they need to be temporarily closed. If you look at what happened in South Korea as an example, a lot of the outbreaks were in pubs and nightclubs that weren't following the rules."

Christy Podolski, co-owner of the pizzeria, said she had gone to her bank on a Friday about three weeks ago. The teller she went to had no change in her drawer and said there was none in the vault.


  “I was shocked,” Podolski said. She had need of quarters specifically.


  She returned the following Monday and already more coins were available. Aside from that one time, Podolski said she hasn’t had an issue.


  During that weekend though the pizza shop at 499 N. Wilbur Ave. put up signs asking customers to either give exact change, leave tips or pay with a card in order to account for the change shortage.


  It was just a small sample of what some businesses across the country have faced after the U.S. Mint and U.S. Federal Reserve alerted banks of a potential coin shortage on June 11.


  Since then, the Fed has established a task force to address the shortage, and its leaders have said they are working to get new coins circulating back into the economy.


  Some experts are worried the shortage could affect small businesses and lower-income Americans, but that has not appeared to be the case in Walla Walla since the announcement.


  It’s possible there will be a “trickle down” effect, just like when the Recession took about a year to hit Walla Walla.


  Baker Boyer Bank’s Lynsey Sherry says that could be a good thing. Sherry is an associate vice president and banking operations manager for the Walla Walla-based financial institution.


  “... What happens in bigger cities does kind of trickle down to us, which is kind of nice,” Sherry said. She said the lag can help businesses learn from mistakes seen in larger cities and devise solutions around them.


  For example, chip readers on credit and debit cards were adopted a little later in the area.


  “There was better information by the time (chip readers) became normalized in Walla Walla,” Sherry said.


  In light of the coin shortage, on top of an international pandemic, Sherry said the four Baker Boyer branches in the Valley have increased communication — if one branch is beginning to run low on coins, they can compile resources to help each other out.


  “We work together to say, ‘OK, who needs what denomination and are we staying within our limit?’” Sherry said.


  Sherry said people probably began panicking about coins when national stores and food chains began putting up signs, alerting people of the shortage.


  But calling it a shortage is a misnomer.


  Economic experts told Forbes recently that it’s more of a change “disruption.”


  It makes sense when a simple thought experiment is played out: Some businesses were closed during COVID-19-related shutdowns — including coin- heavy businesses like laundromats, arcades and car washes. Those businesses were not able to bring in large coin deposits, so banks had to rely on buying the change straight from their U.S. Mint supplier.

"I think that if everybody does what they are supposed to do, we can continue to play, have a credible season and get through the postseason,” Manfred said.


  Just 1½ weeks into a pandemic-delayed regular season shortened from 162 games per team to 60, the coronavirus has forced 19 postponements in 11 days, including St. Louis' three-game weekend series at Milwaukee.


  The virus also prompted at least two more players to opt out Saturday: Brewers All-Star outfielder Lorenzo Cain and Miami second baseman Isan Díaz.


  At least 18 Marlins players have been infected along with three St. Louis Cardinals. One St. Louis player has an inconclusive test.


  Manfred had what he said was a constructive conversation Friday with union head Tony Clark, and expects stepped-up efforts by players and teams to adhere to special virus protocols put in place by MLB and the players’ association.


  "It is what the public health experts have been saying from the beginning about this, that there is no one big magic fix,” Manfred said.


  "The protocols are a series of little things that people need to do. We’ve had some problems. In order to be better, it’s another series of little things. I think it’s peer pressure. I think it’s players taking personal responsibility. I think it’s the union helping us like Tony Clark helped us yesterday. And I think it’s us managing more aggressively," he said.


  Still, he does expect more issues.


  "I don’t think it’s realistic to think that we’re not going to have any more positive tests,” Manfred said. "We're going to be fluid. We think it’s manageable."


  Boston said left-hander Eduardo Rodríguez will miss the entire season because of heart inflammation caused by COVID-19. He has been on the injured list since mid-July and has not pitched this season.


  Miami, which last played July 26 at Philadelphia, was set to resume its schedule Tuesday at Baltimore. The Phillies are due back Monday at Yankee Stadium.


  Toronto missed its weekend series against the Phillies. Blue Jays pitcher Matt Shoemaker was against a bubble-environment such as the NBA and MLS are using and understood Manfred’s urging of stricter adherence.


  "I don’t take Rob’s comments as a personal attack at all because I know we are doing better and some teams might not be, so hopefully they do better,” Shoemaker said. "If guys are going out to clubs or bars that is irresponsible to say the least, if that’s what happened. We have guys not doing that which is great from a team standpoint. We want to play baseball.”


  The entire Cardinals-Brewers series at Miller Park was scrapped. After two St. Louis players tested positive, the whole Cardinals team was given rapids tests Friday and saliva samples were sent to an MLB laboratory.


  St. Louis will play four games at Detroit from Tuesday through Thursday, including a doubleheader Wednesday, rather than two games at Comerica Park followed by two at Busch Stadium.


  "We feel confident by the time we get to Detroit on Monday, that we will have control of this," Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak said. "The thinking was that we’re flying there and it just didn’t make sense to just then fly back and be on a plane again."


  MLB-mandated monitors have been accompanying teams on the road since Wednesday in an effort to cause stricter adherence to the protocols.


  "I think it’s a top-down thing,” Yankees pitcher James Paxton said. "I think that if your leadership is showing how important it is and you’ve got the front office like we have here taking it very seriously, I think that then that’ll trickle down to the players taking it seriously.”


  Given all the schedule changes, MLB is considering whether active rosters should remain at 30 rather than decrease to 28 on Thursday, as scheduled. No decision has been made.


  "This is kind of a day-to-day thing right now,” Manfred said. "You’ve just got to get up in the morning and figure out a way to keep going through another day to stay safe for people.”


  There’s a chance not all teams will be able to get in 60 regular-season games.


  "We’ve got to be flexible on that,” Manfred said. "Look, this is one of the reasons that we revisited the issue off the expanded playoffs. If it turns out that some guys play 60, some guys play 58, they have this new thing called winning percentage. We can sort that out.”


  In another rule change that started this weekend, all doubleheaders for the rest of the season will have a pair of seven-inning games rather than nine- inning contests. The first twinbill under the 2020 change will be between Cincinnati and Detroit at Comerica Park on Sunday following a rainout on Saturday.


  "Doubleheaders were problematic from a health perspective from the very beginning of our planning. That’s why we were reluctant to get into scheduling a bunch of doubleheaders just to play more games,” Manfred said.


  "It’s just too long together and extended periods inside a clubhouse. As we’ve had to move to rescheduling and been forced into some doubleheaders, I think the reality just became that we should do everything we can to shorten those days up from a health perspective," he said.


  MLB said no Phillies players have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week and while three staff members have tested positive, it appeared two were attributable to false positives and the third, based on the timing of the positive test, may not have contracted COVID-19 from the Marlins. The Phillies were permitted to access Citizens Bank Park for staggered workouts beginning Saturday.


  "There’s risk in everything we do,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. "I know that we’ve done a — knock on wood — a really good job of controlling our atmosphere here. And I think it’s important that everyone does that. You can’t slip up, you can’t make a bad decision because it can really cost your organization the game of baseball and everything.”


  MLB rescheduled the postponed Phillies-Yankees games of this week for next week, in New York on Monday and Tuesday and in Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday. New York’s game at Tampa Bay on Thursday was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader on Aug. 8.


  "What the virus has taught us is this is a day-by-day, week-by-week situation that we live in,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.


  Miami will play a four-game series in Baltimore from Tuesday through Thursday, with one game a doubleheader. The Marlins will be the home team for two games.


  MLB said it will reschedule the missed Yankees-Orioles game and Marlins- Phillies series. In addition, Manfred says players and coaches should take advantage of the open seats in the stands near the dugouts and bullpens in order to spread out.

Sharon Marie Heckmann   April 1, 1942 - July 19, 2020   Resident of Walnut Creek, CA   Sharon Marie Heckmann passed away peacefully at home on July 19, 2020 with her loving family by her side. She was 78. Fondly known as Nana, she was our family matriarch, and she was an inspiration to all who witnessed her heroic medical battles. She was born in San Francisco to the late Ralph and Bernice Heckmann and was sister to Thomas Heckmann. A resident of the Bay Area most of her life, she spent her entire career with Ma Bell, retiring from AT&T after successfully working her way up the ladder over several decades. She was known for her dry wit, incredible attention to detail, strong work ethic and fortitude. She was independent, colorful and had a knack for telling it like it is. She had a soft spot for dogs in need of a home and rescued many lucky pups during her journey. She enjoyed quilting, crocheting, cheering for her Niners, playing a mean game of Scrabble and combining sequins and animal prints with happiness and grace. Her life's greatest joy was her family. She adored her daughter and best friend, Lee Ann Livingston, and took extreme pride in her grandsons Christopher, Robert and William Livingston. She treasured cheering for them in life, always challenging them to dig deep and work hard. She was revered and will be deeply missed, and the holidays will never be the same without her legendary deviled eggs. She was a believer. She was unwavering. She was fearless. Her family wishes to thank Dr. Piyush Srivastava of Kaiser Walnut Creek Oncology for his graceful, intuitive care. If desired, please make any gifts or donations in her memory to Animal Rescue Foundation (A.R.F.) of Walnut Creek.         View the online memorial for Sharon Marie Heckmann

  Now, he’s the man of the moment, and by heck has he got the ladies coming over all unnecessary, thanks to his flawless, totally natural and effortlessly sexy performance as the understated, smart, brooding Connell in Normal People.


  And if you haven’t watched it and felt all of the feels (nostalgia for your younger years/being thankful you’re over all that torment/remembering the intensity of your first love/wishing your first sexual experiences were this sensual instead of mortifying because you hadn’t the foggiest how to snog, chief among them), get out from under that rock and hop over to the BBC iPlayer this minute.

This month, we’ll see a rare double header with political conventions.


  They’re usually a month or so apart.


  But this year, Democrats play the first half on Aug. 17-20 and Republicans step up to the plate on Aug. 24-27.


  There was a time when I counted the days to the start of the political conventions.


  Didn’t matter which party.


  They were both exciting, filled with high drama.


  I loved the roll calls where each of the “great states” extolled their virtues for five minutes before casting their votes.


  There was the drama of which states would pass, which would yield and which would have some maverick who didn’t vote the way he or she was supposed to.


  Conventions were like the Olympics.


  They only came around every four years.


  And they were exciting.


  When I was a kid, I’d watch every second.


  Or at least until my parents made me go to bed.


  I remember the battle in 1960 between John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination.


  And 1964, when Ronald Reagan emerged as a political star of tomorrow at the Cow Palace in San Francisco.


  That same year, Democrats had a battle over which of two rival Mississippi delegations should be seated.


  The riots in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic convention would still be exciting television 52 years later.


  Even in 1976, when Reagan challenged the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, the convention was a cliffhanger.


  The final tally was Reagan 1,187 delegates to Ford’s 1,070.


  You couldn’t turn the TV off until Wyoming cast its votes.


  By 1988, when I got to cover both conventions, the excitement was pretty much over.


  The highlights of the Democratic convention that year were probably Jesse Jackson’s “Keep Hope Alive” speech and that boring 58-minute Bill Clinton nominating speech for Michael Dukakis.


  For the Republicans, it was the end of the Reagan era and the beginning of the first George Bush’s, with a promise of a “kinder, gentler nation” and “Read my lips: No new taxes.”


  Rather tame stuff.


  It’s been years since a political convention really mattered.


  Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee.


  Joe Biden will get the nod from Democrats.


  Maybe it’s time we consigned conventions to the dustbin of history.

We have both seen the ups and downs of the industry and business and always supported each other with our sometimes lively discussions and often comical outcomes. Charlie was always willing to listen and without fail provided sage advice and explanation to the problems we discussed, be it geothermal or political! We were very close friends to the point of being able to discuss things in our "closet" knowing it would never go any further. He dearly loved his family and especially his wife, Gail, who he never got over her passing before him. Glenda and I express our deepest sympathy to his surviving family and close friends!

One thing we do know is we will soon have another chance to go weak at the knees with the welcome news he is about to return to our tellies alongside Hollyoaks star Emmett J Scanlan in The Deceived, a psychological thriller from the creator of the iconic and funny Derry Girls.

  Sadly, he reckons it’s unlikely we’ll get another series of Normal People – for a while anyway (patience, people).


  ‘The truthful answer is no – there’s no talk as it stands. But I’d love to play Connell again. It’s tricky… sometimes the mistake has been made where you rush back into something because an audience has liked it.


  'I’d probably wait for Marianne and Connell to enter another phase in their life, get a bit older and figure out what they mean to each other.’


  Well, whenever you’re ready, Paul, we’ll be waiting…

Eid-ul-Adha celebrations continue in full swing on the second day as  people proceed to sacrifice animals, as part of the Sunnah of Hazrat Ibrahim (AS) and Hazrat Ismail (AS), amid the coronavirus pandemic.


  In a bid to maintain the successes achieved in containing the coronavirus pandemic in the country, the government has advised the masses to strictly comply with safety guidelines while observing Eid and municipal authorities and other relevant departments across the country have made comprehensive arrangements for cleanliness and collection of offals.


  The health authorities had issued a detailed advisory in July for Eid prayers and animal sacrifice in order to avoid spreading the virus. However, the SOPs were violated at some places during Eid prayers as many faithful were seen offering prayers without masks and hugging each other.


  Meanwhile, the first day of Eid-ul-Adha was dawned with special prayers in mosques for the well-being of the Ummah, progress, prosperity, and security of the country as well as the importance of following the Sunnah of Hazrat Ibrahim (AS).


  President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan also urged upon the nation to be more dedicated to the cause of Eid-ul Adha and help the poor and needy amid the pandemic.


  In his message to the nation on Eid-ul-Adha, President Alvi said that "while celebrating an occasion with a spirit of sacrifice, one must not forget the deserving people".


  He felicitated the entire nation and the Islamic world and said that "surely this happy occasion will bring a lot of happiness and accomplishments in our life".


  While greeting the nation on the occasion of Eid-ul-Adha, PM Imran urged the people to strictly follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to contain the spread of coronavirus. There should be no needless visits to loved ones and the people should go outside if it were necessary, he said.

Trailblazing independent comics creator Terry Moore has announced that his next story, _Ever_ , will bypass the single issue comics format and go straight to short graphic novels, beginning with its first installment in November. The first book, which runs 72 pages, is called _Ever: The Way Out_. Moore shared a rough version of the book's cover on his YouTube channel, which features a young woman who is the only person able to see a man standing in a busy street beside a dimensional portal. The series will center on angels and demons, which means there's a decent chance it will have direct ties to _Rachel Rising_ , Moore's horror comic from a few years back.


  That young woman on the cover is named Ever, and when she turns 18, she becomes the the key to opening the Pit of Darkness where all the sinful angels are kept. Moore explained that Ever, a descendant of a "an angel/human interaction," doesn't want to be the key, because it means sacrificing herself to The Beast, a gruesome, multi-headed, four-dimensional being.


  "When I finished _Five Years_ , the question was what do you do next?" Moore said in a YouTube video. "Long story short, the new story incoming out in November and it's a trade paperback format; I'm not doing the single issues leading up to it."


  Moore's _Strangers in Paradise_ was a huge hit in the '90s and has gone on to be an evergreen line of trade paperbacks for Moore. The characters from _Echo_ , _Rachel Rising_ , and _Motor Girl_ , all of whom have ties to the _Strangers in Paradise_ characters, joined up with _SiP_ 's Francine and Katchoo in _Five Years_ , which recently concluded. During his Comic-Con @ Home panel, which was released earlier this month, Moore talked about the challenges of the comics industry -- where readers often prefer collected editions, especially for non-superhero work, but the single issues keep the lights on and the comic shops open.


  0comments


  "Everybody was asking, 'are you going to do an omnibus [for _Five Years_ ]?" Moore explained. "Yes, we will. I never promote the omnibus when the series first starts because people say 'okay, well I'll wait for the omnibus,' which means I don't see them for a year. I miss you -- I want you to read the singles. People who buy the singles keep the series alive, of course, with sales. The people who trade-wait, at least I get to see you twice a year. But the people who wait for the omnibus, I only see you once a year, or when I finish a book -- which is actually the way the book world is supposed to work, but it sure is nice to sell them a chapter at a time, too."


   _Ever_ will be in stores in November.

New Orleans, Baton Rouge area People in Business for Aug. 2, 2020

It all started with a chest x-ray.
   
 Before the chest x-ray, I'd harbored some vague notions of invincibility. My mother and father-in-law both died young, which should have been enough to dissipate any illusions. Despite this, I was living my dream life in those days. I had married Daphne, my childhood sweetheart, and we were the parents of two beautiful children. I was in training to be a gastroenterologis. Things just seemed right.
   
 But Daphne had developed a persistent cough, so I ordered a chest x-ray for her as a precaution. That examination revealed another reality: A cancerous mass the size of a bowling ball. I looked at the films myself, and when I first saw the tumor, I thought Daphne was going to die. And I could not tell her that.
   
 We held hands in silence that day on the way home, the terrible gravity of our new reality hanging unspoken between us. When the tears came at last, they came in a torrent so intense that we had to pull over to the edge of Highway 15-501.
   
 "The kids won't remember me," Daphne said.
   
 That blunt statement crushed me.
   
 The eventual diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma, advanced but eminently treatable. After six months of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, we had our lives back.
   
 A few years later, at age 42, Daphne was found to have breast cancer -- a consequence of radiation therapy she had received for the lymphoma. But she had a bilateral mastectomy and survived that, too.
   
 I'm 58 years old now. Daphne and I have now lived long enough to see our children marry. We even have a granddaughter. As a physician, I have intimate experience with people at the extremes of their lives. Having witnessed both the beginning of life and the end of it, I have come to realize that there is the potential for profound beauty in what lies in between.
   
 The COVID-19 pandemic has brought me a fresh perspective. I've had colleagues, friends, co-workers and relatives become infected with it. I've watched several COVID patients die, alone and isolated from their families. Today's world has become a cavalcade of the strange, from riots, earthquakes and hurricanes to comets, dust storms and plagues of locusts, creating a pervasive aura of impending apocalypse.
   
 But life goes on -- adulterated, but persistent. And despite the stress of the pandemic, we should all take a moment or two to reflect upon what this all means.
   
 First of all, we are not immortal. And that makes every second of our lives precious, every memory vital, and every experience something worth cherishing.
   
 Second, we should all try to make a difference in the world -- not for ourselves, but for others.
   
 The late John Lewis once said, "If you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to do something about it." Our lives should not be driven by selfishness, or by the base needs of material acquisition, but by the desire to do the right thing, driven by courage of our convictions.
   
 Finally, we should all learn to appreciate the fundamental power of love. Love is the most powerful of human emotions -- and yet we all too frequently squander it, failing to appreciate how truly important it is until the people we love are gone forever.
   
 Recently, Daphne developed yet another dry cough. She didn't feel ill, and she had no fever, but the cough persisted for weeks.
   
 Last week, Daphne got another chest x-ray.
   
 It was all clear.
   
 With age also comes wisdom -- and with wisdom comes the ability to count your blessings while you have them. That's the intrinsic beauty of the in-between.
   
 Count me among the blessed. You should count yourselves, as well.

MANNING, S.C. (AP) — COVID-19 has had a negative effect on many across the country, but one manufacturer saw it as an opportunity to partner with a software company and create an innovative way to stay in business while adapting to the new normal. Advanta Southeast, a metal fabrication manufacturing company in Manning, teamed up with Verifyii, a software company in Greenville, to create a kiosk that can detect a person’s body temperature before entering a facility or workplace, reducing the risk of spreading the coronavirus and any other future illnesses. The Verifyii Elevated Body Temperature Screening Platform is meant to eliminate wasteful labor costs on manual screening and data entry and is the best way to practice social distancing while checking a person’s temperature, company leaders say. Verifyii co-founders Ben O’Hanlan and Brett Kraeling already had the product made into a kiosk with several different features available, but just before the pandemic began, they added the elevated body temperature feature. This specific feature piqued the interest of many different types of businesses across the country that were looking for ways to continue working through the coronavirus. A person stands at the edge of the 5-foot-long kiosk next to a black body reference box, which was required by the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration to detect an accurate body temperature. Then, in a matter of less than 3 seconds, the kiosk will tell the person whether he or she passed the test on the screen. O’Hanlan said the product keeps employers from having to hire a person to work a door, taking temperatures manually and putting themselves at risk. Plus, if someone does have a high temperature, the kiosk will notify human resources immediately so the situation can be handled...

News story) John M. Carey, a lawyer and partner in the firm, Eastman & Smith Ltd., known as a deft litigator and in whom nonclients - family, friends, colleagues - trusted for personal counsel, died Thursday in Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center. He was 69.      He had a heart attack, his son, Jeremy Carey, said.      He led the litigation section at Eastman & Smith, which he joined in 2011. He concentrated on commercial transactions, contracts, and business and represented clients in state and federal court.      In a quote preceding his biography on the law firm website, Mr. Carey said business litigation is far more about the facts than the law, and the client is the resource.      "Until we have listened carefully to our clients' stories, we cannot represent them well," Mr. Carey said.      Rudy Peckinpaugh, Jr., an Eastman & Smith partner and a friend, said: "John was one of the sharpest and most creative legal minds I have ever known.      "He was all about client service, mentoring young lawyers, and making sure client interests were fully protected. His door was always open. He never was too busy to help a colleague," he said.      Mr. Carey was among the firms' attorneys taking part in a webinar, "Creditors' Rights and Covid-19," in April.      "During this crazy pandemic, it was always John Carey who insisted our section get together in these Zoom meetings" - even to converse without an agenda, Mr. Peckinpaugh said.      Mr. Carey prepared well and was a presence in front of a jury, said Judge David Lewandowski, of Lucas County Domestic Relations Court, a high school and law school classmate.      "He had this terrific mind and a good writing talent," Judge Lewandowski said. "John was a competitive guy in an academic way as long as I knew him."      Mr. Carey, while not outgoing, his son said, "could talk to anybody about anything. He wasn't the guy at the party making the rounds, but the guy at the party that everybody wanted to talk to."      He was a sounding board for friends and colleagues and would say, "'I don't know why people come to me,'" his son said, adding, "People trusted him. Everyone would go to him for counsel.      "He was a real logical thinker," said his son, a Toledo police sergeant. "He would tell you maybe what you didn't want to hear, but it was the right thing."      Mr. Carey began his career at the firm, Fuller & Henry, first as an associate and then as partner. For 26 years, he was a partner in the firm, Watkins, Bates & Carey.      He was born March 4, 1951, to Marcella and John Q. Carey. His father, a lawyer, was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives at age 26 and became mayor of Toledo at age 34. Two years later, he became a judge of Lucas County Common Pleas Court, serving until his death at age 52 on Jan. 6, 1958.      As a child, the younger Mr. Carey on occasion went to the court house with his father. "I definitely think that's why he became a lawyer," his son said.      He grew up in Point Place after his mother married Donald Harlow, whom he did not regard as his stepfather. "He called him Dad," his son said.      He was a graduate of St. Francis de Sales High School, Williams College, and the University of Toledo law school. While in law school, he became a clerk for Judge George Glasser, then a recent appointee to the Common Pleas Court bench by Gov. James A. Rhodes, a Republican.      "John came from a very Democratic family. John and I didn't have any problem in that regard," said Judge Glasser, a retired judge of the Ohio 6th District Court of Appeals. "John impressed me as a very bright young man. We worked together very well and maintained a very friendly relationship after he went into practice. It was delightful. We met for lunch every several weeks."      Traveling and fly fishing were favorite pursuits.      "His real devotion was to his family," his son said. "If you needed John Carey, he was there. He was larger than life. He didn't act that way, but everyone who knew him, knew that's what he was."      He was formerly married to Terese "Terry" Carey.      Surviving are his life partner, Ann McCauley; sons Jeremy and Patrick Carey; daughter, Elizabeth Carey; sisters, Kathy Carey and Linda Morgenstern, and three grandchildren.

  "That's what I think about when I think of Peter - integrity," said his friend of nearly 50 years, Dennis Azevedo. "He played and coached with a will to win, but he would never compromise his principles to get there. Peter always did things the right way to be successful and it's really been my honor to be his friend for all these years."


  Kasarjian was a three-season athlete at both Plymouth-Carver as well as Springfield College but it is his work on the soccer field for which he is most well known. He is a two-time inductee into the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame, both as a player and as a coach.


  "I actually came to Plymouth a little bit late," Peter said. "I lived in Medford until the eighth grade, and that's when my family moved down here. My father owned a restaurant in Manomet, the Lord Alden, and I've been here in Plymouth ever since."


  A four-year soccer and baseball player at P-C, Kasarjian also dabbled in basketball and hockey during his time as a Blue Eagle. "I got recruited by a friend of mine to be the goalie on the hockey team. We had a pretty good team. We won the Cranberry League championship my junior year."


  While playing high school sports Peter's parents were working an often unavailable to get him home after practice. Fortunately he had a back-up plan.


  "I can't tell you how many times I got a ride home from (former physical education teacher and athletic director) Henry Cryer after practice. He had a huge influence on me," Peter said. "He's the reason why I decided I wanted to be a physical education teacher. I wanted to chance to help people like he had helped me."


  After playing forward on the soccer team in high school Peter shifted to the back line in college. "I didn't play a lot, but I learned that you could learn a lot just by watching," he said. "I got my chance to start as a senior and I think we were a Top 20 program that year."


  Peter continued to stay busy at Springfield College with three years on the club hockey squad and two seasons as goalie on the varsity lacrosse team.


  "I think I was able to handle everything better in-season," Peter said about playing three sports in college. "It gave me a timeframe to get things done."


  It was also at Springfield that Peter and Azevedo formed a 50-year friendship that continues to this day.


  "Peter introduced me to my wife, Diane," Dennis said. "They graduated from Plymouth-Carver together."


  Peter was back teaching and coaching soccer in Plymouth as soon as he graduated from Springfield. He was a sub-varsity coach for two seasons before elevating to the varsity spot for two years. He was named head coach of the men's soccer program at Massasoit Community College in 1979 and moved over to Mass. Maritime Academy in 1981. He led Massasoit to a New England title, and at one point in that championship season his team was ranked fifth in the nation.


  After the 1985 season Peter stepped down from his head coaching duties as his twin children, Brian and Kate, grew older.


  "I'd spent so much with other people's children and I wanted to make sure that I spent all the time I could with my own," Peter explained. "My wife Debbie was a teacher in the Plymouth school system as well, and she was the biggest supporter of me in all my coaching endeavors. I couldn't have done it without her."


  While he did lighten his coaching load, he never could quite step away from coaching soccer. Peter has been an assistant with several local high school programs and was even on the sideline helping out Plymouth North Girls Soccer Head Coach Eric Foley as late as last year.


  Peter is also part of the group that started the popular Championship Soccer School that helps hundreds of players each year get ready for the fall soccer season.


  "I'm really appreciative of coaches like Emerson Coleman, Dennis and Eric for letting me work on their staff over the years. I still love teaching the game," Peter said.


  Azevedo said having an experienced hand such as Kasarjian on staff was always a blessing.


  "One thing I've learned from Peter is to coach the entire team, not just the top players," Azevedo said. "That's one thing I've always admired about Peter as a coach. He can connect with everyone on the roster and make them all feel like they are part of the process. Not all coaches are able to make all their players feel like they have value."


  Kasarjian broke down his coaching philosophy into three key elements.


  "I asked my players to be respectful, responsible and thankful," said Peter, who was also a housemaster at Plymouth South Middle School at the end of his career in education. "I wanted them to be competitive, but always thankful for the opportunity to represent their team. It's not a chance that everyone got."


  Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Ruth Helen Beck Harvin   1922-2020   Ruth Helen Beck Harvin, born in Houston on the 17th of February 1922, passed away peacefully on Sunday, the 26th of July 2020, in her own home.   The older daughter of Don F. Beck and Ruth D. Shackelford, she attended Houston public schools and was in the second graduating class of Lamar High School. She attended the University of Texas, where she pledged Kappa Alpha Theta. At UT she also met and fell in love with Bill Harvin, and they married on the 29th of November 1942, before Bill went off to the war as an officer in the Navy.   After Bill completed law school, he and Helen joined the family of the Baker Botts law firm, where they had many friends over the years. Helen was devoted to her husband, and they enjoyed 65 years of marriage before Bill passed away in 2007. She was very supportive of his career as a Baker Botts partner, and in later years as his caregiver. Always a good sport, she took up first golf and then fly-fishing to have activities they could do together. A strong—and sometimes feisty—woman, Helen was very much an equal partner in the marriage. And she kept Bill grounded. Once when Bill was ruminating, after receiving an award, that there were few great men left in the world, she cracked "and there is one less than you think, Buster."   Helen was very proud of her three children, and no one could say a bad word to her about them. While they were young, she spent most of her time as a mother, actively involving herself in the PTA, scouts, and little league baseball. A believer in the value of education, she made sure they took their schoolwork seriously. While she offered firm guidance and counsel to her children, she encouraged them to be independent and self-reliant. She had them walk to elementary school and allowed them to roam the neighborhood on their bicycles. She instilled in them good values and a strong sense of family togetherness. The family regularly went to church together. She insisted on having dinner as a family, where her strong opinions made for lively conversations. She regularly corrected her kids' grammar (fillers "you know" and "like" were not allowed). A great cook, leg of lamb, fried chicken, holiday oyster dressing, pancakes, and oatmeal raisin cookies were some of her specialties. She also told her kids they would "learn to like" her liver, cauliflower, and eggplant, but they never did. She loved family gatherings and made the kids' cousins and friends always welcome at their house. Each summer the family took off on some cross-country adventure. Acknowledging with a smile her rule over the household, Bill and the kids nicknamed her "The Little General."   Helen also had her playful side. She would get down on the floor and play with her kids and later her grandkids. A natural brunette, she shocked her family one day by coming home from the beauty salon as a blonde, which she remained for the rest of her life. She had a lifelong love of dancing, and one of her favorite dance tunes was "Bad Bad Leroy Brown." She had a regular weekly bridge game with good friends and played golf at the Houston Country Club. Later in life she took up painting and she loved art. She liked to travel, particularly on trips that also involved art appreciation. Fond also of her wine, in her later years Helen particularly enjoyed a margarita and the Golden Beef Tacos at Los Tios, the site of several of her last birthday parties with her loving family of four generations.   Helen's faith in Jesus Christ was strong and demonstrative. She was a longtime member of the Episcopal Church, first at Palmer Memorial Church, where her children were confirmed and the boys served as acolytes, and then for over 40 years at St. Martin's. She generously supported St. Martin's and other Episcopal institutions such as Episcopal High School and Seminary of the Southwest. When she became increasingly housebound, she appreciated very much the regular visits of the clergy and lay ministers of St. Martin's.   In addition, Helen was a docent at Bayou Bend for many years, a member of the Board of Visitors of MD Anderson Cancer Center, a Lifetime Member of PARTNERS at UTHealth Cizik School of Nursing, and President of the Houston Country Club Women's Association. She and Bill were major donors of capital funds to Bo's Place in memory of their son-in-law Bob Lawhon. They also established an endowed scholarship to enable needy Houston students to attend the University of Texas Law School.   After Bill retired in 1984, he and Helen began spending summers at the Old Baldy Club near Saratoga, Wyoming. There they gained new friends from around the country. They enjoyed having their children and grandchildren come visit them, play golf, fish for trout, and play games and watch the sunset on their wide back porch. They also spent part of the winter playing golf and socializing with other friends at Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells, California.   Helen was predeceased by her parents, her husband, Bill; her sister, Irene   Foster and brother-in-law, Joe Bob Foster, and her son-in-law, Bob Lawhon. She leaves behind a large family with loving memories of her long and wonderful life: her son, David Harvin and his wife Sally; her daughter, Susan Harvin Lawhon; and her son, Andy Harvin and his wife Lyl; seven grandchildren, Kimberly Harvin Bryant and her husband Todd; Billy Harvin and his wife Sheri; John Harvin and his wife Molly; Bryan Lawhon and his wife Katie; Harvin Lawhon and his wife Julia; Sahra Harvin and her wife Mary Walenta; and Emily Harvin Martins and her husband Ben; eleven great-grandchildren, Lauren, Carter and Andrew Bryant, Kacey, Maddie and Allie Harvin, Natalie and Eloise Harvin, Ellie Lawhon, and Ashton and Logan Lawhon; and her niece, Nancy Foster Simpson and her husband Reagan; and nephews, Bob Foster and his wife Connie; and Pat Foster and his wife Karen.   Her family is deeply grateful to Carlett Minnix and Nina Calvin for the longtime devoted and loving care they provided to Helen, and also to her other wonderful caregivers Pat Scott and Anita Branch.   As per Helen's wishes, the family will gather for an private interment service in the Garden of the Holy Cross at St. Martin's Episcopal Church.   In lieu of customary remembrances, the family requests with gratitude that memorial contributions in Helen's name be directed to St. Martin's Episcopal Church Endowment Fund, 717 Sage Road, Houston, TX, 77056; Bo's Place, 10050 Buffalo Speedway, Houston, TX, 77054; or to the charity of your choice.

Here he once again plays a hapless middle- aged loser, watching helplessly as his suburban life goes down the drain. Stuart is separated from his wife, who lives across the road with her smug new husband. Meanwhile, Stuart and his much younger new partner, Emma, are dealing with the demands of a new baby and the fact that everyone thinks he’s Emma’s father. The show is filmed in real time, just like 24, with Mack as the anti- Jack Bauer, given just half an hour in which to salvage some dignity out of disaster.

Brown had met Amanda when they both worked in a local travel shop together years earlier. Amanda had a teenage son and the two women had bonded over motherhood and a shared loved of crafting.


  Determined to make a better life for her son, Amanda was strong-willed and hard-working. Brown was the same, which is why the pair were such good friends. Liking the same things would have seemed like a blessing but it would end up being their curse.


  As the birthday night wore on, the clock struck midnight and Brandon told the group he was going back into the house to get to bed as he was planning on working the next day.


  He said his goodbyes and headed in, leaving the remaining friends to carry on with the celebrations. Not long after, Amanda went inside to use the bathroom and was seemingly gone for a suspiciously long time.


  Something made Brown go into the house 20 minutes later and when she got there, she made a shocking discovery. She found her friend in bed with her fiancé Brandon.


  The betrayal fuelled an almighty argument and eventually Brown stormed off in a rage to have a cigarette outside and to finish her drink. It hadn’t been the birthday she’d planned to say the least. Amanda followed her downstairs.


  Not long afterwards, at around 12.45am, two loud gunshots could be heard. They echoed around the streets in the still night air. A horrified Brandon ran outside and found Brown cradling a bleeding Amanda in her arms.

  So many things can happen in the span of a year. When I think about what we were doing last year, I can't help but long for some of those days compared to the last few months of being isolated because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Last May, we were looking forward to my nephew Tyler's graduation from Watson Chapel High School and preparing for the college of his choice in Northwest Arkansas. His mom got us all matching T-shirts and we planned to sit together during the graduation at the Pine Bluff Convention Center.


  Getting together was no problem once we got to our seats. Staying together was a bit of a challenge afterward because of so many people being there. Not only did Watson Chapel have its commencement at the convention center, but so did Dollarway High School.


  I remember Tyler looked dashing in his cap and gown. His outfit would have been unique if he had kept on the shoes he wanted to wear. They weren't exactly kosher with the administration and he (as well as other students) had to change before the ceremony began.


  Later, while everyone was taking photos and deciding whether to go out to eat, I decided it was time to go home since I had worked earlier and was tired. Unfortunately, I was stuck. There were so many cars on the lot where I parked that I was blocked in on all sides. I had to wait at least 30 minutes before I could get out.


  The summer also brought anticipation of meeting a great-great-niece who would be born in July. Her mom, Ashlie, also designed special T-shirts for us to wear to her baby shower.


  The shower was decorated in pink and other colors and the centerpieces were baby unicorns. The gift table was overflowing with presents. We played games and enjoyed the refreshments, which were more than finger food. If memory serves me correctly, we had barbecue cooked by my nephew, Chris, and all the fixings. The cake was good too.


  Although the shower was for Ashlie, we all had a good time. It was one of the first showers I attended where men were there too. Alaya was born healthy with a head full of thick dark hair. This year, I missed her first birthday party, but I'm told her parents went all out to throw her a bash.


  Late last summer, I was also planning to visit my sister and her husband out west. We had thought about getting together on the week they celebrated their second wedding anniversary and traveling to a nearby state to see her kids and grand kids. Unfortunately, a last minute issue shoved our plans.


  I hadn't seen her in two years since she got married again after being alone more than 35 years. Before then, we hadn't seen each other in about 20 years, but we talked quite often by phone. Until the wedding, the last time I saw her kids they were still in high school. Now, the son has three boys and a girl and the daughter has three girls. All of these young people were nearly strangers to me, but there was still that familiar connection.


  My sister's daughter, Angel, had some health issues and was nearly blind. When I greeted her at the wedding, it was difficult for her to make out my face, but once she heard my voice she screamed in excitement. That was a good day.


  This year, the pandemic also put a damper on other events I wanted to attend here. My friend, Gigi, and I had planned to go to the salad luncheon and fashion show at St. John AME Church at Pine Bluff in the spring.


  I remember the first year I went. It was held on the same weekend as the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan. I spent the morning watching much of the wedding coverage on TV. Not only was the couple stunning, but the guests were too, especially the ladies in their hats.


  When Gigi and I arrived at the church for the luncheon, many of the women there also made fashion statements with their hats. However, the salads took the show. I don't know who made them all, but there were salads galore of all kinds.


  I was also looking forward to other programs this year such as the Biz Expo of the Pine Bluff Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Roaring 20's Gala of Southeast Arkansas College, the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Little Rock and various church programs, especially women's day services and conferences.


  One of the most significant gatherings I miss is getting together with the ladies of the birthday club who welcomed me with open arms after my husband died in 2014.


  I was trying to navigate life as a widow after having been married for most of my adult life. Although I had other friends, my sister-in-law and her friends allowed me to join their group and I've been blessed by learning so much from them.


  Whether it was advice about work and finances, the best places to shop or travel, enjoying grown folks' music or simply dining together and enjoying each other's company, it was all worthwhile. Maybe we'll get a chance to do it again soon.

Natick Police Chief James Hicks wishes more people understood that television police procedural dramas don't accurately reflect his profession.


  "'Chicago PD,' you see police officers who are skirting the rules, and it's OK because at the end of the day, they look like heroes, and they save the day," he said. "(Actual officers) have to have the highest of integrity … and they have to understand they're totally under the microscope, as we should be."


  Moved by state and nationwide demands for reform following the deaths of people of color at the hands of police, Massachusetts lawmakers have proposed new legislation in recent weeks. Key to state reform is the idea of accreditation - creating a set of standards all police departments will have to follow.


  "I think, in general, Massachusetts police leaders are very progressive and very innovative," said Brenda Bond-Fortier, a National Police Foundation research fellow and Suffolk University professor of public administration. But she also said current policies might not hold water in departments with less progressive leaders.


  Moving to a national accreditation agency, such as the Virginia-based Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, could allow for more specificity, as well as nationwide consistency, she said.


  Local police say their departments already have access to an accreditation system. Police chiefs have kept the formerly state-run Massachusetts Police Accreditation Commission operating since 2004, when the Legislature cut its funding just eight years after its creation. As of this past year, 211 municipal and college police departments are either accredited by the nonprofit, or have begun the process, including at least 15 in Greater Milford and MetroWest.


  "The chiefs continued it on our own," Hicks said. "The rhetoric that's coming up now, it doesn't take into account we do a lot of these things that they ask for … for years with no support."


  There should be reform, Hicks said, but police should be at the table as it's crafted.


  "That's an insult," Hicks said, of police not being a core part of the reform process, "because we've been doing it for years … without any support from the Legislature. I think our record is good."

Much like the green pledge above but an interesting element here is the ‘connectivity to the beach’. The site does hold a key spot on the coast and should not continue to be a barrier to the shoreline. It should be opened up to the wider community and redeveloping the empty theme park site brings the potential to do just that, linking the beach with the new leisure and retail facilities.
 Extra visitors usually means more traffic though, hence the promotion of sustainable transport and the electric car charging points planned for at the site's petrol station will add to its green credentials, at the application stage at least. Residents are already used to thousands of visitors in cars driving to this area of the resort and the car parks at Pleasure Island were often full on summer days during its heyday but the traffic impact of the proposed new development remains to be seen.

Fondly known as Nana, she was our family matriarch, and she was an inspiration to all who witnessed her heroic medical battles. She was born in San Francisco to the late Ralph and Bernice Heckmann and was sister to Thomas Heckmann. A resident of the Bay Area most of her life, she spent her entire career with Ma Bell, retiring from AT&amp;T after successfully working her way up the ladder over several decades.

She had a soft spot for dogs in need of a home and rescued many lucky pups during her journey. She enjoyed quilting, crocheting, cheering for her Niners, playing a mean game of Scrabble and combining sequins and animal prints with happiness and grace. Her life's greatest joy was her family. She adored her daughter and best friend, Lee Ann Livingston, and took extreme pride in her grandsons Christopher, Robert and William Livingston. She treasured cheering for them in life, always challenging them to dig deep and work hard. She was revered and will be deeply missed, and the holidays will never be the same without her legendary deviled eggs. She was a believer. She was unwavering. She was fearless. Her family wishes to thank Dr. Piyush Srivastava of Kaiser Walnut Creek Oncology for his graceful, intuitive care.

As a young man he laid brick and saved his money for college. He also spent six years in the National Guard. Jim married the love of his life and high school sweetheart Nannette (Cunningham) Crane on September 17, 1966 and had two daughters, Kim and Kati. Jim owned Custom Masonry in Spokane for several years. He worked with Harold Balazs using Harold's decorative bricks on several buildings. Jim also laid the Eye of the Eagle on the Federal Building in Seattle, plus worked on many other projects including Expo 74 and condominiums in Kauai. Jim then went on to work for The Coeur d'Alenes Company until retiring in 2006. Jim was a Shriner and an avid WSU Cougar (Coug Dad) and Seahawks fan. He also loved bass fishing, golf, and breakfast with his golf "buddies" every Tuesday. He loved his yard and garden and placed 2nd in the Spokane garden contest. He loved entertaining and spending time with his family and friends. Jim was preceded in death by his parents, Lloyd and Yona Crane, in-laws Fred and Helen Cunningham, brother Bill, sister Jeanne, and several other loved family members and friends. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Nannette (Cunningham) Crane, his two children Kim Reber (Larry) and Kati Crane, and his three grandsons Harrison, Hayden and Jacob. Jim was a very loving and caring husband, father, grandfather, and friend. He always had a smile on his face and had a heart of gold! Please Lord take care of our Jim until we all meet again in Heaven. Until then, Jim will be greatly missed by all. A memorial service and celebration of life will take place at a later date due to COVID.

Framingham, Holliston, Marlborough, Northborough, Southborough and Upton are all accredited through the nonprofit, and nine more Milford and MetroWest towns, plus Framingham State University and Weston's Regis College are listed as working toward the designation.


  A Daily News record request found that department policies in Greater Milford and MetroWest, particularly codes of conduct, ethics and lists of what officers can be punished for and how, closely mirror one another. Local police chiefs say that's at least in part because of the accreditation process.


  "Accreditation is a goal for pretty much every department in the commonwealth," Hicks said. "I say 'goal' because it takes a while to get there."


  Most local policies include the code of ethics adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which is written in the first person and includes the familiar promise to protect and serve, as well as thorough language about being a good person and good role model.


  Backing up the code


  Bond-Fortier warned against such broad language in police policies, when not backed up by specifics and consequences.


  "We would want to see policies that are grounded in some kind of standard or best practice. … Sort of generally being a good person is not enough," she said. "I think the vagueness allows for a lot of discretion for police."


  In Greater Milford and MetroWest, that code of ethics is echoed throughout departments' codes of conduct, and specific offenses are laid out, along with consequences. Officers are held accountable for their on- and off-duty behavior; are required to be as courteous as the situation allows; cannot smoke on or off duty or be late for work; and must be careful about even the appearance of conflicts of interest or using their influence to benefit themselves.


  "Being a positive role model is very important to being a good police officer," Marlborough police spokesman Sgt. Zachary Attaway said. "That carries over, obviously, both on and off duty for us."


  Uniform requirements include about a page on allowed hairstyles specific to men and women, proper care and wear, and whether officers can wear earrings - men, no; women, studs only.


  A catch-all offense, "conduct unbecoming an officer," can be used when no defined rule has been violated, but the officer clearly acted against the spirit of the policies and intention of the profession.


  Policies repeatedly warn officers not to do anything that reflects poorly on the department.


  "Believe it or not … there's very strong peer pressure to do the right thing," said Ashland Police Chief Vincent Alfano. "If you tarnish the badge, or you taint the badge, that's everyone else's badge."


  Additionally, Alfano said, a department's good reputation is important to officers' jobs.


  "If (residents) don't respect the people who are in charge of protecting you or enforcing the law … you cannot effectively do your job," he said.


  The code of conduct isn't just a stack of paperwork in Massachusetts. Basic standards are drilled into aspiring officers in mandatory state-run academies, and new recruits must undergo background checks, plus an interview with department brass and other leaders in local government.


  "Different parts of the country have different standards, as far as their police hiring process, their screening and their training," Alfano said. "In Massachusetts, it is very difficult to become a police officer."


  With so many ways to violate the code of conduct, the system is set up to catch bad behavior early and either correct it or kick the person out of the academy or off a department.


  Depending on the severity of the violation, consequences range from counseling to warnings to suspension, then termination.


  "Working in society and working with communities is complex, because it's so diverse," Hicks said. Of people aspiring to be police officers, "They need to be ready for that. Some are not, and we're able to weed them out during the process."


  Good people are an important part of the process, too. The written policies and procedures reinforce responsible hiring and ethical decision-making, but departments and municipal leadership have to make the final call on a person.


  "(Police) have the ability to take people's liberties, they have a right to arrest, they have the ability … in the right circumstance, to take a life," said Hicks. "That's a huge responsibility. We need to ensure we have the right people in place."


  Discipline happens


  The Daily News' record request found that between 2016 and 2020, members of local police departments were disciplined 163 times at 16 departments in Greater Milford and MetroWest. Most of those disciplined were police officers, but at least one town provided data for non-sworn members of the department.


  Offense categories are wide-ranging. Officers can be disciplined for violations of the policies as obvious as breaking the law or excessive force in an arrest, as well as being late for a shift, rudeness or reading on the job. Additionally, discipline isn't restricted to serious repercussions like suspensions or terminations. It includes the full spectrum of addressing an issue, such as "verbal counseling," meaning an officer's superior could have explained the importance of being on time, or how to avoid coming across as rude during a traffic stop.


  In the 16 towns and cities that responded to the Daily News' request, offenses in the time period requested ranged from "unbecoming and criminal conduct" for an off-duty car crash to "insubordination," to "reporting late for duty." Westborough did not report any discipline in that time period.


  "It makes me cringe, when I hear members of the Legislature (saying) 'we have Black and brown people laying in the street who are shot and killed by a police officer.' It makes me cringe, because it's not happening in Massachusetts," Hicks said. "But I'm also one of those saying, 'It's not happening here, but it could happen tomorrow.'"


  Offense categories are also broad, however, meaning it can be difficult to tell if "offense unbecoming an officer" or the even broader "policy and procedure violation" is a minor or major transgression.


  Increased apprehension


  People are naturally apprehensive around police officers, chiefs said, because officers typically show up when something bad has happened. When that apprehension crosses the line into fear, it's the job of the police to fix that, Hicks said.


  "That's hard. It's difficult work," he said. "It takes a lot of effort, and it takes the right mindset to do that, and you have to train that to all your members."


  Officers have to learn to walk the line between being respected enough to encourage citizens to follow the law, and approachable enough for residents to feel comfortable coming to them for help.


  "That's why we stress so much with our police officers, and we actually look for personality types … people with good communication skills," Alfano said. "Communication skills can help us more effectively deal with what we do."


  Attaway said he goes out of his way to interact with people, especially children, who appear nervous around police.


  "We (try) to show people we are people, too," he said. "We're dads, moms and we're coaches as well."


  Community policing, when officers get into their communities without a negative reason - from toy drives to "positive tickets" for children caught doing good, to the school resource officer, to just talking to citizens - is a huge part of making people comfortable with their local police force.


  "We're the most visible part of government," Alfano said. "(Residents) don't know who their legislators are … but they sure know who their police officers are. We have to understand that our actions are always going to be judged."


  Alfano called community policing "a power that can be used for good."


  "There's a need for reform. There definitely is, and there has been for years," Hicks said. "From the law enforcement perspective, the time was 10 years ago to be talking about this."


  Police departments and their chiefs do not operate in isolation, Bond-Fortier pointed out. Talk of reform should also hold municipal leaders, from mayors and town administrators to city councils and select boards, accountable.


  "I think it's important to really stress that there's very little talk about the role of municipal leaders," she said. "Municipal leaders should be expected to be as active in this conversation about police reform, because they're involved around a lot of the decisions."

I went out with some girlfriends and realised that I felt like I’d run out of challenges, and I wanted to try something new. It was my 28th birthday. I used to have a crisis every birthday. This one was a big turning point and I decided that I wanted an adventure.


  'I said, “I want to go and do something else.” And they suggested I should go back to London and try to be a TV presenter. We’d drunk a lot of tequila. The next morning, I went into work and handed in my notice.


  'I ended up spending three days a week in my role, and in my downtime I made myself a showreel with a friend who filmed me making an idea for a girls’ holiday show. It was basically me running round the Algarve, getting pampered and chatting up guys in nightclubs.’


  That was the reel she sent off to a production company who were advertising for a presenter on a dating show. They also happened to be doing screen tests for A Place In The Sun: Home And Away, and Jasmine got the job alongside Johnny Irwin. It’s something Jasmine feels was meant to be.


  ‘I don’t think it happens often that somebody sends off one tape and gets a break like that. So I feel very blessed but also, it was weird because I remember at the time, I had visions of myself standing on a beach talking to a camera. I knew it was going to happen and it was meant to be – it was just weird. They do say that your thoughts create your reality.’


  And, to add to that karma, Jasmine met her husband of 11 years, Jon, in her first week of filming.


  ‘He was my cameraman. It wasn’t love at first sight, but a slow burner. We definitely weren’t each other’s types. We basically got thrown together in this amazing experience. It was the first big series that we’d ever done.

  Carol (Speer) Hollister passed away on July 28, 2020. She will be missed by all who knew her.


  Carol was born in Chicago, IL on March 2, 1943. As part of a Navy family, she moved frequently during her early years, slowly making her way to Long Beach, California, as a young adult. In 1970 she married Clayt Hollister and they moved to Medford, Oregon, to be near Clayt’s sister and family. They moved to Napa, California, in 1976 with their daughter Janet, where they put down roots.


  Carol loved her life in Napa. She enjoyed spending time with her daughter and grand-puppy, Zoe, and she had wonderful friends that she considered family. Carol was very creative and always had numerous home decorating, gardening, cooking, sewing, needlepoint, and decorative painting projects going on at any given time. Anyone who has ever received a gift from Carol knows that she was the best gift wrapper out there. She was proud of her more than 25 years working at Harvest Pediatrics. She loved her job and her co-workers dearly.

  This has been a difficult time in our nation's history as we deal with two plagues that threaten our community and world. The first is the COVID-19 pandemic; the second is systemic racism. Both are insidious and rob us of life. In some ways, the pandemic has highlighted the racial and economic inequities in our nation.


  We've certainly learned quite a bit about our nation in these past few months, which tells a disturbing story of our failure as a society to confront racism and systemic structures of oppression. Access to healthcare, economic resources, technology and education is not equitable in our society. This is evident in disproportionately higher mortality rates for minorities, who often work in high-risk jobs, lack access to quality healthcare, and do not have the necessary resources to work remotely. College students, especially low-income and underrepresented minorities, already vulnerable before the pandemic, are at a greater risk due to these equity gaps.


  Advocating for social justice and equity are part of my DNA. I cannot stay silent in the face of injustice -- how can any of us? Silence is complicity. When we subject others to unjust treatment and violence, it diminishes our own humanity.


  Racism has plagued education in our country for centuries. It was illegal to teach slaves to read or write. Redlining, segregation, and similar discriminatory policies not only prevented equitable access to property and education, but also led to the underfunding of schools that served their communities. Throughout the years, these policies have increased the equity gap. Today, educational disparities still exist. There are disproportionate disciplinary actions taken against students of color, a lack of equitable access to resources in inner city schools, the labeling of children as \"at risk,\" performance based funding, and standardized testing. This further adds to the divide by creating artificial barriers that disproportionately have a negative impact on the poor and underserved minority communities.


  As a society, we cannot endure unless we confront these and take decisive action.


  Today, historic racial discrimination still has lasting consequences, and its effect continues to impede some students from continuing to higher education. While community colleges work to combat this, they are not immune to the systemic structures of oppression and racism that plague our country. Yet, they have democratized education by making it more accessible to people barred from education, the poor, the underserved, immigrants, racial and ethnic minorities. Additionally, while community colleges enroll half of all undergraduates in the United States and by far serve a greater number of underrepresented students of color (35%) than any other sector in higher education, they still receive the lowest level of federal and state funding per student.


  Society cannot change unless we are willing to change, and change starts at home. I believe as an educational institution, we must lead the way in self- examination in order to effect change. The inequity we see in our higher education system must now, and forever, be banished. At QCC, we advocate for open and accessible education for all. We are inclusionary for all students, not exclusive for the privileged. Almost half of our students are students of color. Our classrooms are a rainbow of humanity, where people come not just to learn, but to dream of a better future. However, a recent survey of our students' ability to cope with the pandemic showed that over half often worry about paying bills and that at least one third of our students frequently worry about having enough to eat, a place to sleep, or access to the necessary technology to succeed. We have been finding ways to address these needs, keeping our food pantry and resource center available, offering comprehensive remote support services, and raising over $105,000 for a Student Emergency Fund to assist students with immediate life and educational needs. While this is making a difference, I fear that these numbers fall short of the true magnitude of the challenges our students face, and there is much more we must do.


  We are not alone in these concerns. The cost of education, institutionalized biases, and artificial barriers prevent many students across our nation from gaining access to the education that will prepare them to seek gainful employment and succeed. We must do more. No stone should be left unturned and no conversation, no matter how difficult, should go unspoken in our collective quest for equity.


  Equity agendas must go beyond police reform and must extend to all sectors of society. We cannot endure unless we confront the difficult challenges before us and take definitive action. We must be disrupters of systemic racism and recognize that there is no place in our society for implicit bias. The world is changing and education needs to be the driving force to make sure that it changes for the better. The time is now.

WASHINGTON — The thunderous, eloquent voice of Rep. John Lewis of Georgia will be sorely missed in Congress and throughout our nation, maybe for years to come.


  Lewis was appropriately called “the conscience of Congress” in the unending struggle for African American voting rights that continues to this very day.


  “It is heartbreaking to witness this [Justice] Department’s touting of minimal, substandard actions as it seemingly deserts its mission to uphold voting rights laws,” Lewis complained in a letter to Attorney General William Barr just a few weeks before he died July 17, at the age of 80, after a battle with pancreatic cancer.


  Former President Barack Obama said in a statement that Lewis had an “enormous impact” in U.S. history, especially as a champion of civil rights laws that lifted the Black community into a major voting bloc throughout the country, especially the South.


  Few journalists knew him as well as Joe Davidson, a longtime Washington Post columnist.


  “As mourners honor the courage that earned [Lewis] his reputation as the conscience of Congress, there is another characteristic that stands out for those who knew him from his days as a young civil rights activist — Consistency,” Davidson wrote last week.


  “Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, was among that most persistent and unwavering voices in the fight for African American voting rights.”


  “’It’s still a source of pain that the Voting Rights Act has not been more actively enforced,’ Lewis told me in 1975, 10 years after the passage of the law,” Davidson wrote Tuesday.


  “Fifty-five years after passage, Lewis was still feeling that pain — during a period when President Trump denounces voting by mail and Republican officials use Black voter suppression as an electoral tactic,” he added.


  “A rampant war is being waged against minorities’ voting rights ... but the Department of Justice is failing to show up for duty,” Lewis stated in his letter to Barr. “It is a shame and a disgrace.”


  Davidson added that the Justice Department and the White House did not respond to requests for comment on Lewis’ findings. Gosh, I wonder why.


  But Davidson described what Lewis had to go through in his efforts to make the voting rights laws effective.


  “Lewis was a constant in the tough, unending battle to make America the democracy it struggles to be,” Davidson stated.


  “During a 1975 voter registration rally in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, Lewis recalled a 31-year-old Black woman telling him, ‘I cannot go out and vote, because they kill all our leaders,’” the Post columnist wrote.


  Still, there were success stories. “One was in Bolton, Mississippi, a tiny town where Bennie G. Thompson took office as mayor in 1973.


  “We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the Voting Rights Act,” Thompson said told Davidson.


  “The Voting Rights Act took away many of the barriers to African Americans registering to vote,” Thompson conveyed.


  Thinking of John Lewis’s crusade, Thompson describes himself as “a real beneficiary of his lifetime of advocacy.”


  The bottom line in all of this is a testament to the work of one man, John Lewis, who fought the enemies of free and open elections and won many battles. May he rest in peace.

When I was 15, I went to the distributive education classroom at Robert E. Lee High School and applied for a work permit. The week I turned 16, I started working at Winn-Dixie.


  I had a bit of an inside track: the store manager of the Dalraida location was someone my father had hired years before. His name was Gunter Wendlandt. He was running that Winn-Dixie in the absence of Pat Meehan, who had been the store manager but was dealing with an illness at the time (he eventually recovered and returned).


  My dad took me to the store and helped me fill out the application. I was already hearing about what a great grocery man my dad was, how fast he could move with that feather duster and how many cases he could put on the shelf. The job description said I would be “bagging, cashiering, retrieving buggies and light stocking.”


  In those days, Winn-Dixie employees first went through a series of training videos with titles such as “Bag It Right!” that emphasized how to handle groceries and paper bags (plastic bags were an anomaly back then; paper bags were more commonplace). That store had four or five cashiers with three or four bag boys at all times. We all had to learn what to do.


  I signed up for as many hours as I could get in that 16th summer. On my third day of employment, however, I nearly became unemployed for the first time.

Lampard told BBC One: "We started well for 10 or 15 minutes, scored a goal, had other chances, controlled the game, and we could only blame ourselves from that point in football terms, because we decided to take control, as in 'let's get complacent, let's take our time on the ball, let's try and play short passes like it's a bit of a stroll'.

The new 100-day strategy appears to be based around his new campaign team’s belief that the 2016 tactic of firing up a core base and riding an anti- establishment wave will not be enough to win again. So there is an increased effort to peel off centre ground voters by the president with him placing less emphasis on rancour and discord, and seeking to bring greater political conciliation in a country more divided than perhaps in living memory.

"Unidentified stormtroopers. Unmarked cars. Kidnapping protesters and causing severe injuries in response to graffiti...Trump and his stormtroopers must be stopped."
   
 This is a direct quote from a Tweet posted on July 17. Before considering its source and significance please take a look at the Miriam Webster definition of "stormtrooper."
   
 "A member of a private Nazi army notorious for aggressiveness, violence and brutality."
   
 Adolph Hitler used stormtroopers in his very violent takeover of Germany in the 1930s, following which he launched total war across the whole of Europe. Tens of millions died in military action, from starvation and disease, and in industrial scale extermination camps where those who weren't worked to death were simply gassed or shot.
   
 Please now consider the source of the quotation and the individuals to whom it applies. It was no intemperate, jacked up political commentator, it was none other than Ms. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and third in line for the U S Presidency. And the individuals to whom this unforgivably heinous term is being applied? It's federal law enforcement officers she calls modern American stormtroopers.
   
 What the "progressive" left, leading Democrats and their collaborators in the media call peaceful, constitutionally protected protests have in fact been hijacked by violent mobs. They certainly were started peacefully by well meaning people but very bad actors, usually appearing at night, often masked and dressed in black have been running amok for two months now. As local forces lost control, 20+ state governors, Democrats and Republicans (not the President), were compelled to call up thousands of national guard troops in an attempt to impose order in the streets. Clearly they were not responding to peaceful gatherings.
   
 While Speaker Pelosi refers to federal law officers as stormtroopers and condemns federal involvement, some prominent Democrat mayors have finally realized they have lost control of their cities and begun working with the Dept of Homeland Security to restore order.
   
 Here are some of the indicators these "peaceful" protests having run amok:
   
 29 "incident related" deaths were recorded from May 26 until July 5 including many African Americans, some old people and small children.
   
 Countless injuries, including numerous police officers, many requiring hospitalization. In Portland, rioters firing lasers at Federal officers have blinded three, likely permanently.
   
 Large scale vandalism and burning of federal buildings, police stations and other public and governmental property symbolizing the authority the rioters wish to undermine. Some national guard troops were required to use forest fighting helicopters to extinguish fires.
   
 The takeover of a section of Seattle declared "independent" of American law where lawlessness reigned supreme, people were shot and killed and police were held at bay.
   
 Countless innocent business owners seeing their life's work destroyed by looters, arsonists and vandals. Some were injured or killed trying to protect their property.
   
 Police attempting to restore order being pelted with rocks, glass bottles, explosive devices, and human waste, among other things. Others have discovered baseball bats and Molotov cocktails left behind after clearing out rioters.
   
 There's more but I think the point is clear. Democrat leaders would have us accept that these legitimate actions to restore order are in fact the cause of disorder. In that vein, on July 29 Jerry Nadler, a senior House Democrat and leader of the impeachment proceedings, claimed that such violence was "a myth." Meanwhile other Democrat leaders continue to claim the problem lies with those trying to suppress the violence while the mob gets a pass. And the Seattle City Council, having supported the Defund the Police movement, used taxpayer money to hire private security...for themselves....
   
 We see claims in these pages of President Trump using "dog whistles" to egg on white nationalists and other miscreants. How, then shall we characterize these actions and statements of Democrat leaders? Are they not empowering the mob by casting law enforcement in the role of villain while turning a blind eye on criminal violence?
   
 Any why? It all comes back to their lust for power and total focus on defeating Donald Trump in November. They have ignored public policy needs to go all in on that strategy for 3 1/2 years. I get that the election is just ahead, and that they need the enthusiastic support of their left wing to win. But to give violent agitators, vandals, arsonists and even killers a pass while smearing federal officers to make their political opponent look bad is both reprehensible and unforgivable, and it certainly undermines their sanctimonious effort to position themselves on the moral high road.

The 6-foot-7 Ferris State basketball commit wanted to leave a lasting legacy at his alma mater, choosing “legacy” as his goal word for his final basketball season.


  “I think Reece left a legacy,” Lakers’ head basketball coach Rich Ruelas said. “Just like guys before him had impact on him, I think he will leave a big impact on those who have to step into those shoes he filled for many years.”


  Hazelton started his high school career as a 6-foot-2 freshman with dreams of playing varsity basketball off rip. Being raised in a basketball household, his father Todd Hazelton was a basketball coach for the Lakers, set him on a trajectory for college ball at a young age.


  He set his goals, let them be known and backed up his dreams with his play on the court. Hazelton started his high school career on the varsity team, working his way into a big role by the time he was sophomore and the Lakers made their way to the state title game at the Breslin Center. He was even a part of the Glen Lake football team that made a run to the state finals in 2016.


  “It was a dream to be on varsity basketball as a freshman,” Hazelton said. “When it happened it was a dream come true but it showed me how much work I needed to put in to get to the spot I am at now.”


  Hazelton took those lessons as an underclassmen and harbored them throughout his high school career. He found himself in high pressure situations over and over, excelling each and every time.


  “He takes everything you say to him and puts it on the back burner to pull it out when he needs to,” Lakers’ former head football coach Jerry Angers said. “I think that the mark of true leadership and a true champion.”


  His focus was always on basketball but that didn’t stop him from stepping into the biggest role on the football team as a senior — taking over at quarterback after seeing time as a wide out in previous seasons.

Harp, Alice Louise   1929 - 2020      Alice Louise Harp. beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and friend, who loved Thanksgiving and Christmas and brought those joys and comforts to everyone throughout the year, passed away peacefully in the arms of family on March 16.   In her nearly 91 years, Alice loved so much so well: books, trees, knitting, antiques, pink lipstick, the long days of summer, ripe tomatoes, soap operas, kind neighbors, thank-you notes, music, and the Broncos.   She knitted over 60 blankets for Project Linus, and served at least as many delicious Thanksgiving dinners to family and friends. She tirelessly raised 4 children who affectionately nicknamed her "Pest" for her diligence, and the ever-alert blue "eyes in the back of her head."   A careful listener, she preferred to let others take center stage. Alice was a fan of hard work, a sharp pencil and a cocktail at the end of the day.   She was born in Oakland, California and spent her youth in Nebraska where at age 20 she met and married the love of her life, Dale Harp. She supported him through university, then went on the manage every aspect of family life, allowing him to pursue his career and his passion for fishing. She would not, however, clean the fish. Together, they achieved the American Dream; home, children, fulfilling work, and a long, peaceful retirement.   In retirement, Alice was an enthusiastic antiques collector and dealer, setting up shops in Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Fort Collins. She was captivated by the stories behind each piece, admiring both the beauty and utility of each precious find.   We are ever grateful for her unconditional love, quiet humor, and steady, comfortable presence in our lives. We will never stop missing her.   Alice was preceded in death by her parents, dear neighbors, and her best friend, Jewell Grasmick.   She is deeply missed by her husband of 71 years, Dale Harp, her children, John Harp (Cheryl,) Julie Savoie, (Peter,) Linda Harp, Bob Harp (Pam), sister, Judy Forst, and brother, Daniel Mitchell, 10 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren, and her beloved nieces and nephews.

BAFFORD--Joseph Edmonds. Joseph Edmonds Bafford was born in Brooklyn, NY, on September 11th, 1933, to Joseph Harold Bafford and Mena Edmonds Bafford. He passed on July 23rd, 2020, at Southminster in Charlotte, NC. When he was 5 years old, the family moved to Lexington, NC, where Joe attended elementary and high school. During the summers, when he was in high school, Joe worked in peach orchards to earn money for college. He graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill, where he made Phi Beta Kappa, with a Degree in Business. He then went to Wharton earning an MBA and graduating 4th in his class. After Wharton, he joined the Army working in the Pentagon. Joe's first job was in a Think Tank at IBM in Poughkeepsie, NY, after which he was hired by White Weld. Joe's next position was Director of Institutional Sales at Merrill Lynch where he became a member of the Chairman's Club. He retired from Merrill Lynch after working there for 25 years. In 1965, Joe married Margaret Angeline Brand; they lived in Manhattan. Joe and Margaret's son, Joseph Edmonds Bafford, Jr., was born on June 1st, 1970, and their daughter, Margaret Angeline Brand Bafford, was born on April 6th, 1972. After living in Manhattan and summering in Bridgehampton for 50 years, they moved to Southminster in Charlotte, NC. Joe was a "scratch" golfer and an avid skier, a "powder hound", and his children remember wonderful ski trips all over the world, which they especially loved because Dad could not bring his phone with him on the slopes. Joe was a man who could capture a room full of people with his smile, sparkling eyes, and amazing sense of humor. Joe was predeceased by his parents and is survived by his devoted wife of 60 years, Margaret, and their loving children, Edmonds and his wife, Alexandra of Manhattan; and Angeline of Charleston, SC; as well as his sister, Roberta Bafford Partridge of Ballston Spa, NY. Other survivors include the Rockwell Poissons and Alfred Brands of Charlotte, NC, the Abel Brands of Bolivia, NC, as well as many nieces and nephews. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, there will be no memorial service at this time. In lieu of flowers, friends and family may send a donation to their favorite charity.

But the Mint also slowed down production to accommodate for social distancing for its employees, so a sudden cascade of change orders took the Mint off guard, leading its leaders to ask Americans to bring their spare change to banks or spend it by paying in exact change or leaving tips — just like Big Cheese had done.


  Still, it will take some time for the change to re-circulate into the economy.


  Kelly McPhee, Banner Bank’s vice president of communications and public relations, said it was “a perfect storm” that led to the circulation issue.


  “No one ever foresaw so many businesses being closed for this length of time,” McPhee said.


  Even entertainment companies, McPhee pointed out, bring in lots of coins to banks. For example, McPhee pointed out how Walla Walla Sweets Baseball didn’t have its season, so the usual ticket sales, beverage and food sales at the ballpark didn’t happen all summer.


  As the closures piled up for businesses, the coins stopped rolling in. The coins still exist, obviously, but they aren’t getting moved around.


  One solution McPhee has seen is larger businesses inviting patrons to round up their orders to the next dollar to assist charities. Then the charity in question gets a check cut to it, therefore no loose change ever gets exchanged. It cuts down the business’s need for the change, but the bank still doesn’t get it either.


  Every change in the economy has an effect on the change in the economy.


  McPhee said this isn’t the first coin conundrum the U.S. has seen.


  In the 1960s, a coin shortage happened when precious metals became in short supply, leading to the Coinage Act of 1965.


  “As a nation, we have been in this situation before” McPhee said. “... we should take some reassurance in that.”


  In the meantime, some businesses have encouraged electronic payments.


  “I know with overall electronic transactions — online payments, online banking, wire transfers — we have seen a significant increase in all of those,” McPhee said. “At one point our wire transfers were up 80%.”


  Sherry said local banks should be aware of the habits of their customers.


  “We have people who are pretty knowledgeable of the merchants and their patterns,” Sherry said. “So we can kind of plan ahead based on history.


  “So far we’re just kind of taking it week by week as it’s happening.”


  Livit Coffee owner Andrew Thonney said a lot of his coins come from tips left behind by customers.


  “At that point (running out of change), we would have to recycle coin with tips, to be honest,” Thonney said. “Being a coffee shop, a lot of our coin comes back in tips.”


  Both McPhee and Sherry said the circulation issue should not be confused as a move to remove cash from the economy.


  “This is simply one more thing that has occurred with the pandemic,” McPhee said. “There is not somebody behind the scenes trying to remove cash from society. As a bank, we can say with great confidence cash and coin will always have a place in our economy.”

She was born on November 25, 1946, in Shelby, North Carolina, to the late Nadine Ellis Huss Brown and the late Kemp Donald Huss. She grew up in Lincolnton, NC.      Linda graduated from UNCG in 1969. She was proud of her Southern heritage and was a member and officer of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Johnston Pettigrew Chapter No. 95 in Raleigh. She retired from Bayer Crop Science RTP in 2011, and continued contracting with several crop protection companies until April 2019. Linda was a giving person, financially supporting many worthwhile organizations such as the North Carolina Art Museum and North Carolina Public Television. She also volunteered as a Girl Scout leader for over eight years, volunteered at her church, and volunteered in the library at Leesville Middle School.      She is survived by her loving husband, Don Aschbrenner; daughters Laura Chapman Smith (Jeff), Raleigh; Jennifer Aschbrenner Schultheis (Paul), Westminster, MD; and Kristen Aschbrenner Dubovec (Jim), Emerald Isle, NC; and four grandchildren who were the lights of her life; Kylie Smith, Taylor Schultheis, Tucker Schultheis, and Palmer Grace Dubovec. She is also survived by a brother, Kemp Huss (Pam), Bath, NC.      Linda's greatest joy was spending time with her family and friends. She had a wonderful sense of adventure and she and her husband traveled extensively, both around the world and in the US. They loved nature and the beauty of the National Parks. Their goal was to visit as many National Parks as possible; they visited 26 parks and admired the beauty in each of them. She and her husband loved relaxing at their beach cottage on Holden Beach, where she was actively involved with the local community as a past board member of the Holden Beach Property Owners Association Board of Directors, and a member of the Holden Beach Chapel.      The family extends its deep gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Copeland and her team at Rex Oncology Center in Raleigh. Dr. Copeland and her team provided excellent care and counseling during the time Linda was undergoing treatment for this aggressive cancer. The family is grateful to Heartland Hospice Care in Raleigh, whose care was very calming and allowed Linda to be at peace.      A private interment of her ashes will be held at Highland United Methodist Church for the immediate family. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a celebration of life will take place at Mitchell Funeral Home at a future date.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's visit to Ayodhya to review preparations for the bhumi pujan ceremony for the construction of the Ram Mandir on Sunday was cancelled after Kamal Rani Varun, a minister in his cabinet, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).


  Kamal Rani Varun, 62, had tested positive for Covid-19 on July 18 and she died at a hospital in Lucknow on Sunday due to the viral infection.


  "The information about the untimely demise of my colleague in the government of Uttar Pradesh, cabinet minister Smt Kamal Rani Varunji, is disturbing. The state lost a devoted public leader today. My condolences to her family. May God grant the departed soul a place in their feet. Om Shanti," the chief minister tweeted in Hindi.

HUNTINGTON — As school districts across the country begin to release tentative plans to bring students back to the classroom in the fall, some families who had a taste of what homeschooling could be like during the COVID-19 shutdown may choose to become their child’s primary teacher this year.
 For Merisa Hensley, a Cabell County resident, keeping her two children, Jaxon, 3, and Jake, 9, home for the 2020-21 academic year seemed like the most practical option.
 “For us, it wasn’t as much the virus itself or the scare, but just the way everything is set up. I just didn’t think that our 9-year-old would do well not being able to be hands-on, close to his friends or having to wear the mask all day,” Hensley said. “It’s just a lot for kids to take in.”
 Jake has struggled with anxiety in the past, and the uncertainty of how the school year will unfold also played a role in Hensley’s decision — and she’s not alone.
 A national survey by Nationwide Children’s Hospital found about 90% of parents are concerned about the school year, and two in five said they’re worried about their child’s mental wellness, nearly the same as those who indicated a concern for their physical well-being.
 Hensley said although the county presented three options to families — a full- time, five-day scenario, blended model or virtual learning — she was concerned about her children receiving one-on-one attention.
 “All the uncertainty, all the changes at one time, even the virtual option — for us, (Jake) excels in his work, so my worry was if there was a teacher from the state of West Virginia monitoring all the work, are they going to send out strictly all fourth-grade work? Are all of them supposed to be on the same level?” she said. “I didn’t feel like there would be a lot of individualizing. I didn’t feel like each kid would get that individualized approach.”
 For her 3-year-old, Jaxon, Hensley has selected an at-home Pre-K program to further eliminate risk.
 In June, The Washington Post reported that in 2016 about 3.3% of children in the United States were homeschooled — a number that remained steady for years prior — but there will likely be an uptick this fall as coronavirus cases continue to rise in many places.
 Jessica Lynn Fox, artistic director and owner of 4th Avenue Arts in Huntington, said this need has certainly hit locally and pushed the facility to relaunch its homeschool program with a focus on performing arts for all ages this fall.
 “As things so rapidly change, we saw a giant need. Our community started reaching out and asking and inquiring if we were going to be doing a program, and we had already had it in the works,” Fox said. “We’re hoping it will be a program that will help out families in general no matter what their learning situation is at home.”

The timeless children's novel _Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret_ , written by Jewish-American teen-lit icon author Judy Blume, turned 50 this past week.


  The coming-of-age classic, focuses on 11-year-old Margaret as she navigates puberty and questions her faith after growing up without a religious affiliation due to her parents participating in an interfaith marriage, was written by Blume to reflect her own childhood experience - a certain viewpoint that she never found any other author to discuss prior.


  Therefore, when she had her children, she began writing the tale - mirroring her own experiences as a child, according to CBC. It would go on to be named one of _The_ _New York Times_ ' "Outstanding Books of the Year" (1970) the year of its release.


  "It was my third published book, but the first real book, the book where I just let go. I didn't know what I was doing. I just did it -- and this is what came out," Blume told host Tom Power in a "q" CBC Radio interview.


  The book itself, generally categorized as a young adult novel, covers many taboo coming-of-age situations that other authors might hesitate to task on - including a character's experience with her first period or buying her first bra, sexual urges and even pornography. She notes the character, Margaret, is a medley of her friends at 12-years-old.


  While these might be run-of-the-mill topics that authors would be happy to tackle today, in 1970 the book revolutionized young adult reading and even became the target of many censorship inquiries due to its sexual and religious content - some over the past five decades have even called for the book to be banned.


  However, she never intended to create controversy, only to share the "honest" truth.


  "I didn't really think about that. I just wanted to be real. I wanted to be honest," Blume told CBC Radio.


  She then referred to her late development in adolescence, noting this made her obsess about natural processes - such as breast development and longing for her first period.


  "I was small and not developed, and everything came later to me. So this was what I wanted desperately -- and so does Margaret," the author told CBC.


  "To me there was nothing wrong with thinking about getting your period and wanting your breasts to grow. It wasn't controversial in my mind. It was just true."


  When the book published, she donated three signed copies to her children' elementary school, however, the principal refused them.


  "The male principal was not a good guy for many, many reasons. But he removed them from the library, and he said, 'You know, girls in sixth grade are too young to read about this. We can't have these books in our library,'" Blume told CBC. "Never mind how many girls in fifth and sixth grade already had their periods in those days."


  And while many aimed to ban the book, Blume recalls receiving countless letters from female readers saying the book helped them feel comfortable in their feelings and urges, and let them know they weren't alone - which Blume said invigorated her later work.


  "They said all these incredible things, and I thought, 'Maybe I can really do this thing. Maybe I can really write.' Because I didn't know until then," Blume told CBC. "It was so reinforcing and supportive, and that's what every writer needs to keep going."


  While many of Blume's tales have stood the test of time, they also represent figurative time capsules on where we were and where we are going. The agnosticism and blooming sexual awareness that once would have seen this book banned throughout many libraries the 70s, is laughable today - spotlighting Blume's visionary talent early on, a vision that will also stand the test of time.    _   Zachary Keyser contributed to this report._

Confederate flags fluttered in the breeze on the southwest corner of the Daviess County Courthouse lawn Saturday morning, and a large crowd wearing mostly red sang “Dixie’s Land” at one point.


  An early morning rain stopped for the hour-long Save the Confederate Statue rally. Shortly after the event ended, a steady rain drenched Owensboro.


  The rally was staged to provide a forum for local residents who want a monument to a Confederate soldier to remain on the courthouse lawn, where it has been for 120 years.


  “My Old Kentucky Home” played on a loud speaker moments before the event started. Men dressed in Civil War-era costumes and carrying rifles with bayonets stood around the statue.


  Members of the Sons of the Confederate Veterans, a heritage group, gathered near the stage. Some passing motorists honked to show support as they drove by on Frederica Street.


  At the rally, many people carried signs.


  One man strapped the 10 Commandments to his chest.


  Another hoisted this message: “We are one. All lives matter.”


  Someone else held a large sign that read, “Remembering ugly history ensures a beautiful future.”


  Jack Gish, who leads the group that wants the statue to remain at the courthouse, said he hopes Daviess County Fiscal Court does not bow to pressure to remove the monument.


  “This is part of history, and it needs to remain,” Gish told the crowd.


  “Amen!” a man in the crowd replied.


  Amid growing pressure around the commonwealth to remove Confederate statues on courthouse lawns, Daviess Fiscal Court was slated to vote June 30 on returning the statue to the United Daughters of the Confederacy Kentucky Chapter.


  Instead the court, through a motion presented by County Commissioner George Wathen and backed by commissioners Charlie Castlen and Mike Koger, delayed the vote until Thursday. Daviess County Judge-Executive Al Mattingly dissented.


  Saturday’s rally was meant to bring together those who favor keeping the statue where it is, but also to offer education about the monument and its historical relevance outside of the “negative narrative” that has arisen nationally surrounding similar Confederate iconography.


  Locally, the Owensboro chapter of the NAACP is leading a community-based effort to move the statue to a museum or other setting where it can be used for educational purposes.


  “Everybody has a right to freedom of speech,” the Rev. Rhondalyn Randolph, president of the local NAACP chapter, said of the rally. “But I think everyone has a responsibility and should be held accountable for what they say.”


  Randolph did not attend the event or watch it online.


  People on both sides of the Confederate statue issue feel strongly, and minds were set before the rally, she said. Randolph doubts any opinions were swayed by the event.


  “Let’s move forward for the betterment of everybody,” she said. “I pray the county commission will do the right thing. ... Let’s learn from what we have gone through, and let us move on.”


  Theresa Jones, who represented the UDC, was one of the event’s speakers. “There is no reason this statue needs to be moved,” Jones told the crowd.


  During the Civil War, many soldiers were buried in joint graves in ditches and fields. The statue was created to honor them, she said.


  “For 120 years, this statue has stood right here,” Jones said. “Let’s ask our community to use it as a teaching moment.”


  H. K. Edgerton, an Asheville, North Carolina, Black activist for Southern heritage, was the rally’s keynote speaker. He was dressed in a gray flannel Confederate uniform.


  “I am not going to say anything until we sing ‘Dixie,’ ” Edgerton told the crowd when he first took the stage.


  He led the crowd in the unofficial Confederate anthem while he waved the South’s flag.


  At the song’s end, the audience let out a collective “Whoo!”


  Edgerton said the statue was not built for white Confederate soldiers only, but it is an “integrated war memorial” for people of all colors who fought, including Black men.


  “They are with us no more,” he said of Confederate soldiers, “but the memory of their noble and upright life, of what they did and sought to do for the good of the South will be cherished to the end of time. The greatest weapon the South had was the irrepressible spirit of the Southern soldier.”


  During Edgerton’s speech, a man in a white Toyota truck drove down Third Street with a Black Lives Matter banner hanging out the driver’s side window. The truck’s driver stopped near the stage and honked the horn to disrupt the rally.


  He later parked his truck and walked to the corner of Frederica and Third streets, carrying the banner.


  Edgerton left the stage, grabbed a Confederate flag and walked toward the man, along with several people attending the rally. No exchange took place. Instead, the group returned to the rally peacefully.


  Near the end of his speech, Edgerton asked those in attendance to stand up against those who want to remove the statue from the courthouse lawn and “have the courage of your ancestors.”
