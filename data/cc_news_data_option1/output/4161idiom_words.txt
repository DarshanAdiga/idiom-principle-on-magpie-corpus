 # Jerry Stackhouse focuses on controlling the controllables in year two with Vanderbilt basketball

 Controlling the controllables will be a theme for Vanderbilt basketball this season. But despite the coronavirus pandemic altering preseason activity, coach Jerry Stackhouse perceives much more can be controlled in preparation for this year than one may think.
 Stackhouse spoke to media Thursday and admitted he isn't too fond of wearing a mask and gloves, but he does so. COVID-19 is an uncontrollable factor.
 In his second season, what Stackhouse can control is getting his squad to believe improvement is possible and familiarity with SEC foes betters the team's preparation, setting players up to be more competitive than their 3-15 SEC record from a year ago.
 "We now have a better understanding of our league," Stackhouse said. "There were a lot of new coaches last year, so I think we have an understanding of teams and their schemes. We have a better outlook on how to prepare for them.
 "You can watch as many scouting tapes as you want of teams playing other teams. But until they play you and (you don't) have to deal with things you bring to the table. I liken it to a playoff series: Once you get into an NBA playoff series and have tape, now you can make adjustments. We have that tape now of our foes."
 In addition to Stackhouse, Texas A&M;'s Buzz Williams, Arkansas' Eric Musselman and Alabama's Nate Oats were in the first year of their coaching tenures at their respective schools.
 From Stackhouse's first year, he believes the mental picture of what he wants Vanderbilt to be will become more vivid in year two — at least for the players that are eligible to suit up this season.
 After announcing in December he'd transfer to Vanderbilt from Kansas, Issac McBride is likely to sit out. Stackhouse told reporters it would be "a very pleasant surprise" if McBride receives his waiver from the NCAA to play this season.
 However, Stackhouse is high on his freshmen. He said four-star recruit Tyrin Lawrence has been one of the hardest workers, both on the court and in the weight room. The second-year coach also mentioned guard Trey Thomas and forward Myles Stute.
 "Those guys just have a maturity about them," Stackhouse said. "You feel like they're really trying to learn what they're supposed to do because they want to get out there and play."
 Scotty Pippen Jr. and Dylan Disu are top returnees. Even though the pandemic has made the immersion process somewhat different for the freshman, the controllable still lies intact. Stackhouse believes the youngsters will be ready to play.
 "Those are going to get opportunities," Stackhouse said. "We didn't bring them here for them to just kind of learn the ropes. We're gonna need those guys to make contributions for us this season."
