Dear Dave,   I own a small company, and we lease the building we operate from. As an entrepreneur, how do you know when it is time to stop leasing and buy a place of your own?   Peter
 Dear Peter,   You should only buy a building when you have a solid track record of success, and a really good idea of what your building needs will be. A growing business is always a good thing, but you don't want to focus too much on real estate and not enough on generating revenue and managing that growth intelligently. You would also want to make sure you're going to be in anything you buy for a good, long while.
 I'm a big fan of leasing the first few years after starting your own business. It's even better if you can work out of your home, but I understand that's not always practical. Down the road, you can choose to lease with an option to buy, or, in the right situation, just buy a building.
 Remember, make sure you do it all with cash. Don't add debt to the equation!   Dave
 Is it ever too late?   Dear Dave,   Life insurance is one of those things I always said I would get around to buying someday, but, for various reasons, I just haven't done it yet. Is there ever a time when it is too late to get life insurance?   Angie
 Dear Angie,   First of all, I only recommend level term life insurance. It's fairly easy to get until around age 70, depending on your overall health situation. Once you get into your seventies and beyond, however, it can be more difficult to find reasonably priced coverage.
 I recommend that most people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in term life insurance. To be honest, though, you really shouldn't need life insurance if you're 70 or older. At that point, if you've saved and invested wisely over the years, you can be self-insured. By this, I mean you've got enough money in savings and investments to cover funeral expenses - plus enough for a spouse to live on comfortably after you're gone.
 Don't wait any longer, Angie. Take care of this today!   Dave

Wilpon has been around MLB since 1980. Wilpon is either influential in MLB’s inner circle or does a good job of carrying out policy. Take the Mets spring training home for example. Wilpon got the 32-year-old Port St. Lucie stadium rebuilt with most of $57 million needed for the upgrade coming from taxpayers. St. Lucie County borrowed $60 million for the renovations and to pay off $5 million in old debt on the stadium. The county received $20 million from Florida to help pay for the project. St. Lucie County is using revenue from a bed tax to pay off the loan. That is the kind of deal that the Lords of Baseball love. Using other people’s money to build a plant to house their business. Wilpon also instituted a policy which shows the contempt baseball owners have for their minor league players. Wilpon not only separates well- heeled customers from fans in the ballpark by price but also minor league players from major leaguers in the clubhouse. The Class A Florida State League’s St. Lucie Mets players cannot use the clubhouse during the season. They are unworthy seasonal workers.

Gladbach will visit Kickers Offenbach in the DFB Pokal round of 16 on Wednesday with Favre's men widely expected to progress past the fourth-tier club.
 For many clubs, the German cup represents the best opportunity to qualify for the UEFA Europa League but Favre is more interested in the glory.
 Although no club outside of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke have won the DFB Pokal in the past five seasons, Favre has clearly targeted the title for Gladbach, who have not claimed a major trophy since winning the same competition in 1995.
 "The DFB Pokal is not only the quickest way into Europe but also the quickest way to pick up a trophy," the Swiss coach said on Tuesday.
 The DFB Pokal champions qualify for the UEFA Europa League, while that honour can be bestowed on the runners-up if the winners reach the UEFA Champions League through the Bundesliga.
 While Favre may be dreaming of the final in Berlin on May 30, Offenbach still have to be dealt with and the 57-year-old refused to underestimate the Sudwest Regionalliga leaders.
 "The standard of football in Germany is very high," Favre said.
 "Offenbach are a very good fourth division team. They play good football, are tactically astute, including being able to switch between different formations, and very well organised."

Stoke confirmed on Friday that Hughes has penned a contract extension at the Britannia Stadium and the Welshman insists he is determined to challenge for honours and continue to evolve in the Premier League.
 "I don't think people want to be told that we are just looking to stay in the league," Hughes told the club's official YouTube channel.
 "They want to be told that you're chasing trophies, you are looking for good cup runs, you are looking to progress and be a top-10 side, that's how I've always viewed it and that won't change in the coming seasons."
 Stoke, the 2011 FA Cup finalists, were knocked out of this season's competition by Hughes' former club Blackburn Rovers in the fifth round and exited the League Cup against Southampton in round four.
 When asked about his approach to cup competitions, Hughes said: "I've always gone strong.
 "My view is that there are only so many trophies that we can realistically go all the way in, so why limit your chances.
 "You may as well have a real go and see how far you can go. There are plenty of games in the season; players will get games as well it's important to use the squad.

Muamba, playing for Bolton at the time, fell to the ground at the London venue during an FA Cup quarter-final with Tottenham in March 2012.
 The Congolese midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest, and his heart stopped for one hour, 18 minutes.
 Now retired, Muamba, 26, said Gomis' scare playing for Swansea against Spurs brought back the memories of his near-death experience.
 "I was busy trying to concentrate on my uni work - that takes priority nowadays - but I heard about Gomis through social media," Muamba told the _Daily Express_.
 "You are not sure of the full details but you can put two and two together and then it came out that he collapsed when no one was around him and, when I saw that it was White Hart Lane, I thought, 'Oh no, not that place again'.
 "I tried to put all that to one side and just carry on with my work but it was very difficult."
 Muamba explained Gomis' episode was more predictable than his own, given the latter's medical history.
 "It's very different to what happened to me. Bafetimbi Gomis has a history of medical issues," Muamba continued.
 "I did not have a history, so it was a real surprise when it happened to me.
 "But it would not have been a surprise to the medical staff there dealing with him because it was not the first time it had happened.
 "With me, no one could understand it.
 "But he would have been in excellent hands with the medics, who would have done an excellent job of looking after him."
 Gomis was stretchered off White Hart Lane and was given an oxygen mask, but the Frenchman has assured fans he is OK - crediting stress over his father's health as one cause for the incident.

STURBRIDGE -- Old Sturbridge Village is usually brimming with thousands of schoolchildren during the April school vacation week. That will not be the case this year.
 "April vacation week alone is a big week. It's the beginning of when things start getting busy for us," said James E. Donahue, president and CEO of Old Sturbridge Village. "If we have nice weather, we could see a 1,000 people or more a day. So April vacation week can be a 10,000-person loss."
 If OSV is shut down through June, it would lose out on 25,000 to 30,000 schoolchildren visiting on field trips, Donahue said.
 Donohue said he has developed a plan in case the living history museum is closed until September.
 "Right now, I have a plan that we could be shut down to the public until Sept. 1 and be OK," Donahue said. "That's the plan that I have put together with my team. I hope we're not shut down for that long. But I have a plan in place that will get us through to Sept. 1."
 While there is really no good time for a pandemic to hit a living history museum, Donahue said it would have been worse for OSV if the closure occurred during the last quarter of the year (October, November and December), which is their busiest time of the year.
 "When we shut down in the middle of March, we were coming off a very good winter. We had a very good January, February and the first half of March was very good," Donahue said. "And that time of the year is typically our slowest time of year. So we kind of went into the closure at a pretty good spot."
 Monday, a number of OSV staffers will be placed on furlough, Donahue said.
 "We're going to cover everyone's health insurance. They're still employees of the Village. They're just being furloughed for what we hope is, maybe, four to eight weeks," he said. "I don't want anyone to lose their job as a result of this pandemic. My goal is to bring everybody back as soon as I can."
 As for salary cuts, Donahue said it's definitely a possibility if the economy worsens, but he added that nothing like that has been finalized and they want to get through this critical stage first.
 OSV has had cancellations for functions scheduled for April and May at the Oliver Wight Tavern, which is rented out for weddings, graduation parties and other events. But many of the bookings have been rescheduled for the fall, Donahue said.
 In addition, Old Sturbridge Inn and Reeder Family Lodges at OSV are closed, but they are not terribly busy during this period, so it hasn't really made much of an impact, Donahue said.
 The coronavirus pandemic hit in the middle of the third school year for Old Sturbridge Academy Charter Public School. Like all schools in the state, it was ordered to close its doors.
 "As soon as we closed, we went into phase one of remote learning. The staff came in. They prepared packets of work and we mailed those packets out at the beginning of the week. And it was about a week's worth of work for kids related to their curriculum," said Donahue, one of the school's founding directors. "Then we took that week to prepare for the online learning experience. So we launched that the last week of March and we've been running that since then. It seems to be going very well."
 Donahue said they deployed Chromebooks and iPads to Old Sturbridge Academy families who did not have that technology at home. Also, the school made resources available for parents and students facing social and emotional challenges that might come up during this period.
 "Going to school at Old Sturbridge Village is such a unique experience. There's no way that I can bottle that electronically," Donahue said. "Are they getting the experience I want them to have? No. They're getting a good experience remotely, but it's no substitute for going to the Village. And they know that."
 To keep Old Sturbridge Village visible, many of its costumed interpreters, historians and artisans have been doing "Virtual Village" segments that have been posted on the museum's Facebook page and online on YouTube.
 "When this is over, we don't know what the world will look like," Donahue said. "I've told my staff, look, we've got to be flexible. We've got to be creative. And we've got to take our lead from our public health officials, the governor, and do what we can to support everyone's health and wellness."
 After the coronavirus pandemic is over, Donahue said, he thinks that because OSV is primarily outdoors, that's going to be a big advantage for the living history museum.
 "People are able to be socially distant. They're able to enjoy the fresh air. That has been the beauty of the Village," he said. "If we weren't an outdoor facility, I would be a lot more anxious. At the end of the day, if we are allowed to open up, I think people will see it as a place that they want to go. But it's still going to be tough."

Chi beve birra artigianale sarà perplesso (possiamo spiegarvi), a chi non è pratico del settore consigliamo di leggere l'intervista pubblicata ieri al presidente di Unionbirrai, che in soldoni vede uno spiraglio di speranza, per la sopravvivenza dei piccoli produttori in questo momento terribile, (anche) nell'ingresso nella grande distribuzione organizzata.
 Con i dovuti compromessi: _shelf-life_ , prezzi al ribasso, prodotti delicati (non pastorizzati, non micro-filtrati), nonché la concorrenza delle multinazionali, hanno sempre instillato grossi dubbi nel mondo craft, che da sempre vede nella GDO un nemico, più che un'occasione.
 Così la pensano Roberto e Giovanni Faenza, padre e figlio, proprietari di Ritual Lab (Formello, RM), birrificio apprezzatissimo tra gli appassionati, specialmente per birre luppolate e luppolatissime. Nerd Choice(s), per capirsi. L'opposto della grande distribuzione organizzata. "Non per pregiudizio", ci spiega Giovanni Faenza al telefono, "Semplicemente perché le nostre birre non sono adatte allo scaffale, dopo due mesi perderebbero le loro note caratterizzanti e perché, di certo non siamo in grado di soddisfare grosse richieste".
 Per non parlare della catena del freddo, delle luci a neon degli ipermercati..
 "Se io avessi un player a disposizione disposto a tenerle in frigo e rispettare i tempi di produzione, non mi farei alcun problema ad uscire in GDO con il nome del mio birrificio. Non sono contrario ai principi della grande distribuzione in sé, ma mi preoccupa la logistica a cui siamo abituati in Italia. Nei supermercati degli Stati Uniti, per dire, si trovano grandissime birre craft", specifica.

 With case numbers levelling off in recent weeks, and three new diagnoses in a four-day period, Mr Jones confirmed we are not out of the woods yet.

"When every tomorrow is the same as before..." That line certainly reflects what many of are feeling like as the quarantine goes into its second month, but that song, "Dance of the Clairvoyants (Mach III)" is but one of many on Pearl Jam's new album, "Gigaton" that resonate with added potency. Of course, the album was written and recorded long before the advent of COVID-19, but the themes of times changing so fast you can't adjust easily, even as the natural world suddenly becomes as much an enemy to be conquered as an ally to enlist, lands with extra impact.
 In general, Eddie Vedder's lyrics again take that path of seamlessly merging the personal and the political, so that many tunes, with the usual torrent of images and shaded meanings, can be interpreted several ways. Common themes are the changing environment and the need to try to control climate change, the constant conflict that stifles any real progress, and the more personal quandary of how does one conduct oneself in such chaotic times. And in terms of the more political feelings suffusing the album, it is safe to say none of the band members will be caught wearing a red hat any time soon - but we all knew that.

 We'd suggest fans check out the album on Youtube, where you can stream the dozen songs for free, with the accompanying videos, or as the band dubs them, "visualizations." The videos include a lot of dreamy shots of natural wonders, many of them presumably in the band's Northwest home region and they often dissolve into pictures of destruction or nothingness. But a bonus is that the lyrics are superimposed on the bottom of the screen, which surely helps understand what Vedder seems to be saying. Musically the album ranges from the typically punk-rock-charged metal rockers to quite a few more reflective, even acoustic-based numbers.
 The album begins with "Whoever Said," and it's as much a mission statement as anything else, summing up what is to come. Rapidly thrashing power chords frame Vedder's opening statement, where he seems to be using stilted words to satirize the general B.S. quotient of much of what we hear these days. The stirring chorus "Whoever said it's all been said, gave up on satisfaction..." aptly portrays the confusion of quickly changing times and mores, whether he's talking about personal or universal matters. The tune shifts into a slower mode, where he notes "all the answers will be found in the mistakes we have made..." even if we are "living in a backwards time." But gradually it becomes more clear that the term "satisfaction" can be seen as a synonym for "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" and by the conclusion Vedder's howling "I won't give up on satisfaction" seems like a rallying cry, a paean to resistance in general.
 The punky pop sound of "Superblood Wolfmoon" continues that aura of hopeless confuision, but adds in the question of romance - is it selfish to seek it in such times? And then the "Dance of the Clairvoyants (Mach III)" provides a swirling dreamscape of squalling guitars to depict hopes and dreams frustrated, yet busting out. The thumping heavy metal march "Quick Escape" tells of the unending quest to find a place or a situation our leaders haven't screwed up yet. For a big contrast, the eerie ballad "Alright" follows by showing the desire to sometimes step back and think things through in solitude.
 "Seven O'Clock" is another rousing rallying cry, despite its easy mid-tempo flow. Speaking of getting downhearted as being self-indulgent at a time when all hands on deck are needed, it notes "a tragedy of errors," and recalls we "saw the destination and got so close before it turned," and that can be interpreted however you choose. But when the lyrics refer to Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, and then add an unflattering depiction of our president, the political perspective is unmistakable.
 The second half of them album takes a stylistic swerve to lower-key arrangements, but the roots rock verve of "Never Destination" is delectable, as it depicts flying through time, with where we end up still up in the air. That exciting tune is followed by another rowdy rocker, the fast, pounding tempo of "Take the Long Way," where our singer seems to be facing down an internal battle, almost as if he's scared of commitment, to a person or a cause.
 But then the album goes into three consecutive ballad-type songs, and although each one is a contemplative song where repeated listening unveils more meaning, cramming all three together makes for a kind of abrupt change of pace. "Buckle Up" is kind of an outlier, seeming to be concerned with caring for an elder, and possibly dealing with assisted suicide or mercy killing, but the chorus, "firstly do no harm, then put your seat belt on, buckle up" is truly haunting to anyone who's been in that situation.
 "Comes then Goes" is a soothing ballad, mostly acoustic, where Vedder seems to be revisiting an old friend, and looking back at better times and whatever separated them. "Retrograde" is another reflective ballad, a bit more mid- tempo and more hopeful, a bit of an optimistic look at the future.
 "River Cross' concludes the album and is colored by the singer's realizing his own mortality, as the image of the river seeming ever wider stands in for all he wanted to achieve, and the goalposts seeming to move ever farther away. It's not a ballad, and probably more of a dirge, with a gradual uptick near the end, but Vedder's plaintive vocal merges gospel shadings with a kind of resigned determination. Once again, it's an attitude that seems tailor-made for these times.
 So it's no surprise that the latest Pearl Jam album brings a lot to unpack, from the sharp musical twists and turns, nods to their stylistic sweet spot but also a variety of other sounds, as well as lyrics with multi-level meanings. We may be discussing, and arguing over this one for years to come, but right now in the spring of this weird 2020, it seems to catch the zeitgeist.

Aalen will host Hoffenheim on Tuesday with a spot in the cup quarter-finals on the line and Gisdol is wary of a fixture he predicts will be "hard fought".
 From the start of November, Hoffenheim lost eight of 11 Bundesliga matches but have gone unbeaten in their past three league games, overcoming Stuttgart and Mainz, plus earning a draw at Freiburg.
 But Gisdol is concerned the expectations surrounding his side could be setting Hoffenheim up to disappoint.
 "Expectation levels amongst fans and the media have risen. For some, picking up a point in Freiburg or finding life tough against a buoyant Mainz side isn't enough," the 45-year-old said on Monday.
 "Improvement can't continue at this rate forever, but we have an aim for the cup game: We want to progress to the next round."
 While Aalen sit in the relegation zone in the 2. Bundesliga, Gisdol is not taking success for granted ahead of Hoffenheim's trip to the Scholz Arena.
 "Perhaps it's Aalen's biggest match of the season, I think it's going to be a tight, hard fought match," he said.
 "Our players will not know as much about their direct opponent as they do in the Bundesliga. There are some players in Aalen's squad that we don't know a lot about, which makes it tougher.
 "After the recent rainfall, it's going to be a difficult and very heavy pitch to play on as well."
 In Tuesday's other DFB Pokal fixtures, Borussia Dortmund will travel to Dynamo Dresden, Bayer Leverkusen will host Kaiserslautern and, in the only all- Bundesliga clash, Freiburg take on Cologne.
 Freiburg and Cologne are separated by just three points in the top flight's standings, with the former second-last in the Bundesliga.
 They are also set to play again in the league at the start of April but Cologne coach Peter Stoger rubbished suggestions he might tailor his line-up at Freiburg's Schwarzwald Stadion to focus on Bundesliga survival.
 "I don't care if it's a cup, league, or a final, we approach each game one at a time," he said.
 "And we are fully focused on the opponent in front of us."

Kenwright and chief executive officer Denise Barrett-Baxendale were at the club before Moshiri arrived, whereas looking in to St James' Park from the outside, it appears that this takeover could be far more immediate and the changes sweeping.
 Everton, as you will read a later on, have wasted plenty of Moshiri's millions on expensive and overly paid players who have not cut the mustard but his ambition has been unwavering and, adding in what he paid to buy into the club, consolidate debts and the money he has promised towards the build of a new stadium, it takes his financial commitment to around half a billion pounds.
 But new shareholders, and new ideas, inevitably brings instability. Everton are still searching for consistency now and at the time of Moshiri's arrival it was rightly noted that Manchester City experienced unsettled early periods when they were taken over in 2008.

Everton's wage bill was also disproportionate for where they were finishing in the table and their wage to turnover ratio remains too high for comfort.
 The second-half of the Moshiri-era, to date, has been about trying to rectify that and change approach, with younger players - who have sell-on potential - at the heart of what the club are trying to do.
 Expectation was sky-high, particularly in that lavish summer of 2017, but it soon unravelled and so Everton have learnt that having a clear strategy, set by a director of football, and a manager in tune with that, is essential.
 Otherwise, a lot of money can be squandered in the blink of an eye.

Rocco Adrian is making good on his promise.
 Wando promoted Adrian to interim head football coach on Wednesday. Adrian has spent the past four years as an assistant with the Warriors, the past two as the varsity defensive backs coach.
 He replaces Jimmy Noonan, who resigned as the Warriors head coach in February before accepting the Georgetown head job less than a month later.
 “It’s been a whirlwind,” Adrian said. “But I’m excited for the opportunity. I’m excited for the challenge. I can’t wait to tackle this thing.”
 Adrian spent his first eight years out of college as an assistant at Christ Church, the final two as defensive coordinator and assistant head coach. He then spent the next decade in the college ranks with stops at his alma mater Furman, North Greenville and then Gardner-Webb.
 He’s the son of longtime college coach Pete Adrian, the head coach at Norfolk State from 2005-14.
 “Football is in my family’s blood,” Adrian said. “We've all spent our lives in the game.”
 Adrian was out of coaching five years ago though. His brother, Zac, had been battling cancer for two years. Adrian sensed his condition was worsening and wanted to be more available to his younger brother. He needed a more flexible schedule. The demands of the game just wouldn't allow it. So Adrian left football and went into business with a few friends operating a rental company.
 Zac, a former punter at Bethune Cookman, could sense how badly his brother missed the game. Adrian would assure him that he was fine but Zach could see through that. So Zac urged his brother to get back into it. Follow what he loved. Adrian promised he one day would.
 Zac passed way in 2015 after a three-year battle with cancer. He was 36 years old.
 “That’ll change you,” Adrian said. “I definitely have better perspective of life now.”
 Adrian’s ability to challenge adversity was one of the first things that Jamel Smith mentioned of his former secondary coach. Smith served as defensive coordinator at Wando before accepting the head job at Lucy Beckham this offseason.
 “He was always the guy that wanted to take on that challenge,” Smith said. “I always noticed when things got rough, when we hit adversity, Roc was the first one to stand up and take that on.”
 Nothing was tougher for Adrian than literally watching his brother take his last breathe. He struggled for months to make sense of things. Then football unexpectedly reentered his life.
 Wando athletics director Bob Hayes, a Furman grad himself, knew Adrian through their ties to the Paladins community. Hayes offered Adrian a volunteer coaching spot on the Warriors B-Team four years ago. Adrian was promoted to the junior varsity the following season and then awarded a full-time position on the varsity staff a year later.
 “He’s a natural leader. People gravitate toward him,” Smith said. “You could just tell he was going to be a head coach. He’s supposed to be a head coach.”
 There was some thought Smith might take over the head job at Wando. But when Smith landed at Lucy Beckham, he urged Adrian to apply for the Wando opening. Adrian, also an assistant wrestling coach at Wando, was chasing a region championship on the mat at the time and didn’t initially apply.
 “I hadn’t really had a chance to consider it because we were in the middle of wrestling season,” Adrian said. “But as time went on it seemed like more and more of a possibility. I thought, ‘OK, let’s do this.’”
 Adrian’s hiring was well received within a group text between Wando football players. Most of them wanted someone from within, someone they were familiar with — a head start that’s become especially valuable with the way the current coronavirus pandemic has shut down high school athletics for the time being.
 Adrian's players describe him as a family man, one who genuinely cares about his team. They say he’s one of the more vocal coaches on the sidelines. He’s bursting with energy. He can often be found jumping around as he leads the pregame warm-ups. They say he’s one of the cooler coaches. He relates to his players. And if anything about the Warriors' program is about to change, it's probably first going to be the music selections.
 “He’s a really good guy who actually wants to get to know you,” said Wando senior Will Pickren, who was named a North-South all-star as captain of Adrian’s secondary this season. “He has incredible energy. I think he adds a different type of flair for Wando. Everyone on the team is really excited.”
 Adrian understands the challenge that he's undertaking. Wando has the largest enrollment in the state but, despite its overwhelming success in most other sports, has struggled to ever produce a consistent postseason threat in football. The community is different from most in the diverse offerings for students. There's a charter school located within two miles, a private school within 10, and plenty more options scattered nearby.
 "High school football is high school football," Adrian explained. "There's a lot for these kids to do in Mount Pleasant. We've got to make football exciting around here. We've got to make these kids want to be Wando Warriors. These are smart, hardworking kids in this community and our job is to make help them become the best version of themselves. Football is our best way to do that."
 Adrian wasn't coaching football five years ago. But when his life was turned upside down, it was the game that saved him. He's never looked back. He went from a volunteer to an assistant and is now the head coach of the biggest school in the state. All in four years.
 Little brother would be so proud of how big brother has kept his promise.

Van Gaal is known for his combative style following stints in charge of Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, with countryman and Southampton boss Ronald Koeman accusing the Dutchman of striking fear into his players.
 Former Netherlands international Willem van Hanegem was also scathing of Van Gaal, after slamming the United manager for mistreating assistant coach Ryan Giggs, loanee Radamel Falcao and winger Angel Di Maria.
 However, Van Gaal told United's official television channel that is adaptable both on and off the pitch.
 "I am a very flexible man," the 63-year-old said. "[People] are always thinking I am a boss, maybe a dictator. I am not like that. I am a very flexible man. My wife does know that.
 "You have to evaluate and adapt to the culture of the club. The way I work here with Manchester United is different to the way I worked with Bayern Munich or the Dutch national team.
 "There are lot of aspects in my philosophy I shall stick to, but a lot I shall change and it can only change because of the members of my staff or my players. They can change my thoughts. We have to wait and see how many aspects I have changed after one year."

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to hit Missouri, Gov. Mike Parson is turning his sights to reopening the economy.
 “We got to get people back to work,” he said in Wednesday’s press briefing. “We got to get the economy going here in the state of Missouri. That’s critical. It’s an important issue we’re dealing with right now, and we’re making plans to reopen the state.”
 Parson said he’s been working closely with governors in other states to coordinate efforts to reopen state economies.
 “I think we are all trying to look beyond the COVID-19 virus and start planning on how we open up the economy and still deal with this virus,” he said. “Knowing this virus is still going to be around for a while, we still got to open up the economies in our states, so we’re going to do that.”
 On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases in Missouri climbed by more than 200 to reach 4,895. The number of deaths increased to 147 people — up from 133 on Tuesday.
 Parson said that he will speak more about plans to reopen the state during Thursday’s news briefing as well as the statewide stay-at-home order, which is scheduled to expire April 24.
 Much of Wednesday’s briefing centered on education. Missouri schools will receive $208 million from the federal government under the CARES Act for elementary and secondary schools, Parson said.
 In-person instruction is canceled for the remainder of the school year, but Department of Elementary and Secondary Education officials are working to determine what reentry into school buildings will look like, said Margie Vandeven, Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education commissioner.
 “Not only do we need a consistent plan to ensure that students and educators across the state return to school safely, we need to be prepared to quickly address the educational gaps and the enhanced social and emotional learning needs that may surface among our students,” Vandeven said.
 The $208 million will go toward technology, infrastructure, teacher training on distance learning and moving resources to areas of highest need, Vandeven said.
 “During this time, I continue to be proud of our school leaders, teachers and counselors, food service workers and the other school staff members as well as our Missouri students and their families for the many ways they have risen and will continue to rise to the occasion to tackle the challenges presented through COVID-19,” she said.

AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - The Amarillo Mayor explained how life as we know it will continue to change, even after things go back to normal, in order to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 later this year.“It’s going to happen in stages, and we have to prepare for that. We’ve got to be willing to expect some of the changes. When restaurants come back online, they are probably going to have fewer tables and be spaced further apart,” said Amarillo Mayor Ginger Nelson.We continue to hear NewsChannel 10 viewers saying they aren’t given proper personal protective equipment, otherwise known as PPE, or there is a shortage of these items in our hospitals.“There is not a PPE shortage in this area,” said Amarillo Health Authority’s Dr. Scott Milton.When asked about PPE protocol in hospitals and if they change out PPE after entering rooms with COVID-19 patients, both hospital representatives said they do, except in one instance.“The only situation that we’ve researched and seen nationally is, that if you have a COVID positive unit, where everybody in that wing is confirmed positive, there is a strategy to conserve PPE, where not all of the PPE must be changed going patient to patient. With patients under investigation, you have to, because some of those are going to be negative, and you don’t want to cross contaminate,” said Dr. Michael Lamanteer, Chief Medical Officer at BSA Hospital.The VA Hospital is the first hospital in Amarillo with rapid testing capabilities. In commercial settings, there is also an anti-body blood test which might tell patients if they have been exposed to the virus.“We are happy to report that, as of Saturday, we have started in house testing for COVID-19, and our updated testing capabilities allows us to typically get results within 45 minutes,” said Froy Garza, interim Medical Center director for the Amarillo VA.As both BSA and Northwest hospitals continue to furlough workers, the VA continues to hire.“About two weeks ago we had 36 new staff come on board, and we are continuing to hire weekly,” said Garza.There is a high number of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 20-years-old to 39-years old who are contracting the virus locally, and Mayor Nelson urges them to take this seriously.There are currently five patients across all three hospitals in Amarillo on ventilators.“The data is telling us the more we can keep that patient off the vent, the better off they will be. So there are all kinds of strategies now to try and avoid that intubution. When you do cross that threshold, as Dr. Lamanteer said, seven to 10 to 14 days is the rule for these patients. That’s what we’ve seen at Northwest. Once they are on the ventilator, it’s at least seven days typically,” said Dr. Brian Wies, Chief Medical Officer at Northwest Texas Hospital.There has been a total of 20 recoveries in the Amarillo area, including one patient who left the hospital today after almost one month of care.Copyright 2020 KFDA.

This coming weekend was supposed to be a big one for elite defensive end Landon Jackson. The Texarkana Pleasant Grove standout was scheduled to take his first official visit this weekend – to Texas A&M – but with in-person recruiting visits on hold until at least June 1, Jackson is having to shuffle his plans.
 Instead of taking a big step towards coming to a recruiting decision, Jackson is playing a bit of a waiting game like everyone else until there’s some normalcy in the world. In the meantime, the 6-6, 238-pound Jackson is finding ways to stay in shape and pass the time while much of the country is on lockdown.  
 “Really I’m just working out and running a lot. I’ll go fishing here and there,” Jackson said. “I’m just doing anything I can outside the house.  
 “Really I’m just trying to bulk up, put on more muscle as well as doing these kind of cross-fit style workouts. I’ll do different kinds of workouts to stay in shape, but bulk up as well.”

And in a bid to do so, Everton engaged in a record summer of spending (to the tune of £150m) but a sometimes confused transfer strategy, with manager Ronald Koeman and director of football Steve Walsh not always in agreement, meant lots of money was wasted.
 It is only now, with the appointment of Marcel Brands as Walsh's successor in 2018, that the club have a clearly defined approach to the market.
 There was a feeling, certainly in the first two summers of Moshiri's reign, that they would aim to bankroll success and pay top fees for the best players outside of the top six clubs in the hope of getting there.
 It was bold and brave, and got people's attention, but the process ultimately showed itself to be flawed.
 Those players, by and large, have not produced the goods and it has left Everton needing to clean up the mess, trying to offload unwanted and highly- paid names, with many past their peak years.
 It will still be years before Everton are fully clear of the deadwood in the squad.

 "It's not his ambition to sit here and be an understudy - he wants to get in the team and he is continuing to get better.
 "We are fortunate to have a top-level group of keepers. Asmir is one of the best in the league and at the moment is ahead of Jack.
 "They all push each other though, Thomas Sorensen included, and as a player you need that. Competition is good in any area of the side.
 "We will sit down and speak to Asmir in the summer. He wants to focus on the games first, and rightly so. We are comfortable with that.
 "I know Asmir is happy here and is pleased with our progression. We hope they will be good discussions with him.
 "We have re-contracted Jack and our intentions are to also re-contract Asmir too. We are trying to look after business in the correct way."

Thirteen of the 32 countries who featured in last year's showpiece in Brazil were from Europe and there will be 14 in 2018 due to Russia being the host nation.
 Infantino told reporters on Monday that he believes there should be A stronger European presence in World Cups given the success of Italy, Spain and Germany in the last three tournaments.
 He said: "I think there is a big chance that we have more than 13, because if you look at it objectively, based on facts, 19 of the top 32 ranked associations are European.
 "The last three winners of the last three World Cups were three European teams, so I think it's absolutely objective and fair to be asking for one more position only.
 "We could ask for more than one, but one more would already be a good sign to the sporting merit, and at the end of the day to crown the world champion, we must have the best teams in the competition, so I think there's a good chance there.
 "I don't know if FIFA is trying to reduce the places, I don't think so. I cannot imagine a World Cup with less than 13 plus one, the host, European teams taking place.
 "So you know, whatever speculations and discussions are being made the absolute minimum is the status quo, and we’ve proven on the pitch that something more has and can be done."

As shelter-in-place ordinates continue to keep families in their homes and schools from opening after a long hiatus, students and employees alike are learning how to study and work remotely.
 Within this transition will come complication, mainly with low-income families who will have a hard time adjusting to this change in scenery, either due to lack of resources, internet connection, etc., leaving children in these households unable to learn and keep up with their studies.
 In light of this issue, the Austin Independent School District (ISD) in Texas assembled 110 school buses equipped with WiFi capabilities - and have positioned them in neighborhoods around the district, so children in need will have the capability to participate in the school's online learning programs.
 "As we prepare for the possibility of extended school closures, we know that an Internet connection is a lifeline and a learning link for our students," said chief technology officer for Austin ISD Kevin Schwartz, according to CNN.
 The buses, powered by a $600,000 grant from education technology provider Kajeet, will connect directly up to the student's school computers - one more thing low-income families in this district don't have to worry about - and provide WiFi up to 300 feet away.
 "Austin ISD will be deploying many of our 500+ Kajeet Wi-Fi/Internet enabled school buses to locations around our school district so that students can connect using our district Chromebooks," Schwartz added.
 Following the coronavirus outbreak, students in grades 3-7 received Chromebook laptops for the purpose of continuing onine learning from home while the school is closed. Grades 8-12 were already provided devices before the outbreak began.

West Bengal education board will be conducting the remaining three papers for the 10th and 12th board examination in the month of June, reports Times of India. West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, clarified that the board exams cannot be conducted before June while discussing the measures which the state government is initiating amidst the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
 CM Banerjee also announced that all the students studying the WB state board for class 11th will be promoted to class 12th without any examination. A source clarified to Times of India that it is observed that the schools promote around 92% to 95% of the students to class 12th and they are held back only if they fail in the selection test. Thus, the government does not expect it will impact the quality of students next year.
 Regarding the result, the report adds that the result is expected to come out towards the end of July. The process of evaluation has not even begun as the answer papers have not reached the evaluaters due to the lockdown. After the lockdown is over, the process of distribution of answer papers for subjects already conducted and conducting the remaining papers have to be done simultaneously.
 As per earlier reports, the school sessions will start on June 10th after the summer vacation and the lockdown. The teachers are worried about finishing the syllabus in time and the board might have to push back the exam in 2021, the report adds.

In 1959, Freeport had its greatest football team in more than three decades, led by quarterback Harry Kent and a passing attack that would set a touchdown record that would last 28 years.
   
 The biggest obstacle to a perfect season was East Rockford High School and its quarterback, Ron Fearn, in week seven at Beyer Stadium.
   
 Freeport entered that game having scored 188 points and given up just 15. Officially, East was just 3-3, but the E-Rabs were 5-1 on the field. After losing the season opener to Beloit, 12-6, East ran off wins over North Chicago, Joliet, West Aurora, East Aurora and Elgin. Unfortunately, one of its receivers had forged his teacher's name on his grade sheets for Latin, and the E-Rabs had to forfeit the wins over East and West Aurora.
   
 Fans were curious to see how good this Freeport team was. An estimated crowd of 4,000 people showed up and stayed throughout a cold drizzle in the showcase game that year in what was then the Big Eight Conference. The resulting 19-19 tie makes this our pick for the No. 7 high school football game in Freeport- area history.
   
 For three quarters, it seemed as if the game was going to be little more than a coronation for the Pretzels. Freeport led 19-6 behind two Gary Stearns touchdown runs and a 21-yard touchdown pass from Kent to Tom Walz.
   
 Fearn, who would go on to start for three years at the University of Illinois as a quarterback and running back on offense and defensive back on defense, gave the E-Rabs some hope early in the fourth. He led East on a nine-play, 75-yard drive and scored on a quarterback sneak to cut the lead to 19-13 with 7:59 to play.
   
 On the following kickoff, the perfect season nearly came to a shocking end. Freeport failed to field the ball and East recovered on the Pretzels' 6-yard line. Fearn scored from two yards out two plays later to tie the game. The perfect season was in jeopardy, but the undefeated one remained intact when East's kicker missed the extra point.
   
 "Our fullback was supposed to field the ball and he didn't," Kent said in a telephone interview from Corvallis, Montana, where he retired after a long career as a city engineer and public works director in Phoenix and Mesa, Arizona. "It was just a bad break. Until you mentioned it, I hadn't thought about that play in years."
   
 Freeport would rebound to beat LaSalle-Peru, 7-0, and West Rockford, 59-0, to finish 8-0-1. Kent would finish the season with 20 touchdown passes. In the 1950s, the only stat, though, that any media outlets published was scoring. It wasn't until 1962 that the Register Star began publishing rushing, passing and receiving leaders. No NIC-10 player would top Kent's 20 TD passes until 1987.
   
 Despite those gaudy numbers, Big Eight coaches picked Fearn, who led East with 10 touchdown runs and five TD passes, as first team all-conference quarterback. Kent settled for second team.
   
 "That didn't surprise me. We'd been playing against Ron since ninth grade," Kent said. "I was one of a lot of good players at Freeport. He was pretty much their whole team."
   
 That season kicked off a second golden era for Freeport football. From 1960 to 1964, Freeport would go 30-9-5 and win the 1963 Big Eight title.

_Spokesman_ : So, on your first part, I would urge you to actually read every word in the email that was sent to you. On the second part, we will… the Secre… there is no immediate plan to remove the telecommuting circumstance… policies. I think those are now in place at least until 30 April. We will obviously be guided in our discussion with authorities from New York State, from New York City. The Secretary‑General took the decision early on to close down the building, to move to telecommuting, and I think he will not, in any way, jump the gun on re‑opening it.

The federal government’s efforts to help Americans deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic is already going into personal bank accounts nationwide -- to the tune of about $80 million so far this week— but some haven’t received their “Trump bucks” yet.
 Working with the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service today unveiled the new “Get My Payment” website, which will show the projected date when a deposit has been scheduled, similar to the “Where’s My Refund tool” some taxpayers may already be familiar with. People who did not use direct deposit on their last tax return can visit the website and input information to receive the payment by direct deposit into their bank account.
 Get My Payment is updated once daily, usually overnight, according to an IRS press release. The IRS urged taxpayers to only use Get My Payment once a day due to the large number of people receiving Economic Impact Payments.

Less than two months after competing for a state title in Mizzou Arena, Hickman’s Belle Harrell announced her commitment to wrestle for Missouri Valley College on Monday.
 Harrell said that the Vikings checked all her boxes when looking at schools.
 “I looked at what schools had the best training schedule for me,” Harrell said, “the team members that were on it and that what they were recruiting best fit my wrestling type.”
 Carol Harrell, Belle’s mother, believes staying close to home was key for Belle.
 “She liked the fact that it was close to home and she could still watch her younger brothers and their sports activities,” Carol said. “They have a really good girls program there that’s well known.”
 Hickman coach Dan Pieper was excited to see Harrell join the Vikings program, which has had multiple girls go on to compete in the Olympics.
 “Missouri Valley’s a nice program,” Pieper said. “It’s one of the top women’s wrestling programs out there.”
 During her time as a Kewpie, Harrell took the first state championship in girls wrestling for a Columbia athlete in 2019, placing first in the 121-pound weight class.
 Harrell believes Pieper has played a huge role in her wrestling success.
 “He’s probably one of the best coaches I’ve had,” Belle said. “He’s a very big figure in my life. He’s always been there for me.”
 “From the first day she was there he believed in her and pushed her,” Carol said. “He took her under his wing and gave her so many opportunities.

Germany’s representative similarly welcomed efforts by the Government to implement peace-related programmes against the backdrop of the pandemic, as well as preventative actions taken by both the Government and FARC-EP. “Balancing the consequences of COVID-19 is an extremely challenging task and the stakes are especially high with regards to the peace process,” he said, underscoring the need to “keep the political momentum alive and kicking”. Noting that social leaders and human rights defenders who support the peace agreement, indigenous leaders and women’s rights defenders — as well as former combatants — face high risks of violence, he said no efforts should be spared to protect them. Meanwhile, he joined other speakers in expressing hope that the National Liberation Army’s one‑month ceasefire will become a departure point for future engagement, leading to confidence-building measures and ultimately negotiations.
