 CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Rapper Kanye West has sued the West Virginia Secretary of State's Office after being told his bid to get on the ballot for president came up short on qualified signatures.
 Secretary of State Mac Warner's office told news outlets last month that West needed 7,144 signatures from registered voters in West Virginia. West submitted 15,000 signatures, but only 6,383 were confirmed, according to Secretary of State spokesperson Mike Queen.
 The lawsuit says West did not have a chance to challenge that decision before a drawing for order of names appearing on the ballot, WSAZ-TV reported Monday. The lawsuit requests an emergency hearing date and a ruling that would allow his name to be listed.
 West announced a presidential bid in July, saying he's seeking the nation's highest office on a ticket he calls the \"Birthday Party.\"
 West has since been gathering signatures to get on the ballot in several states.

In what was not intended to be a direct response to the LCEA, LCSD Superintendent Dr. Karen Gray wrote to staff this week as the school district prepares for the 2020-21 school year.
 Dr. Gray acknowledged that some teachers believe teaching from home is the best method going forward, but explained why LCSD ultimately decided against it.
 ‚ÄúWhile I absolutely agree we must provide quality distance learning, as an organization, this is not best delivered from teachers‚Äô homes,‚Äù Dr. Gray said. ‚ÄúWorking in our classrooms, accessing school resources and following organized and uninterrupted schedules maximizes our ability to provide quality distance education to our students.‚Äù
 Dr. Gray said as a team, LCSD is constantly working to improve their Comprehensive Distance Learning and Edmentum learning frameworks (LCSD‚Äôs two options for online schooling).
 ‚ÄúWe will follow Oregon Department of Education comprehensive distance learning requirements (more than 50 percent of instruction must be synchronously taught by the teacher), work with our classified staff to support gaps in learning, have access to technical support, and moreover prepare ourselves to bring students back to the classrooms in the coming year if and when our safety metrics allow it,‚Äù Dr. Gray said.
 Dr. Gray reiterated that this new method of distance learning will be much improved from last spring‚Äôs ‚Äúcrisis teaching,‚Äô and that the ultimate goal is to get students back in the classroom. For the majority of instructional staff, while under distance education for students, Dr. Gray said they will be working in a vacant 900 square foot classroom with a fully effective air flow exchange HVAC system and no students. Each room is stocked with sanitizers and is professionally cleaned, as well as the bathrooms. In addition, all staff in the building must follow all social distance and face-covering protocols from OHA and ODE.
 ‚ÄúYou have been able to keep yourselves safe at Safeway, Fred Meyer and Walmart, so at school, the same rules apply. And our classrooms are safer and cleaner,‚Äù Dr. Gray told staff.
 Dr. Gray also noted that the district has been working with LCEA on a plan that will allow anyone in the school district that feels or perceives that they are ‚Äúat risk‚Äù and comes to work in the physical building as required, to choose to alert their school administration that they will work from their classroom and remotely participate in any or all work from their classroom until they feel safe to join small groups socially distanced, work alone in their classroom (some may have educational assistants working with them that they are used to working with), work from home on Wednesdays participating fully and can use their prep time to prep from home for the length of time of prep.
 The LCEA and District administration will meet again this week to finalize an agreement.
 Additionally, LCSD is waiting for the state to allow them to place LCSD child care workers into safe and healthy and monitored spaces they have found in all four areas that are not school district spaces.
 ‚ÄúWe have already received permission from our legal counsel and ODE Deputy Superintendent Colt Gill. I just need the Early Learning Division to give us the green light as ‚Äòemergency child care.‚Äô This can help a lot of staff. I cannot promise but again, I am hopeful. We are working hard to make this happen as soon as possible,‚Äù Dr. Gray said.

When Japanese military leaders climbed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945, the battleship was packed with U.S. sailors eager to see the end of World War II.
 On Wednesday, the 75th anniversary of the surrender, some of those same men who served the United States weren't able to return to the Missouri in Hawaii's Pearl Harbor because of the world's new war against the coronavirus.
 The commemoration initially was supposed to be a blockbuster event with parades, movie premieres, galas and thousands of people honoring the veterans in their 90s or beyond, some who may be marking the milestone for the last time.
 Because of the threat of the virus, the ceremony was scaled down to about 50 people, with local veterans and government officials gathering on the USS Missouri in masks. The names were read of surviving WWII veterans, including 14 who were on the ship the day the Japanese surrendered.
   
   
 Jerry Pedersen, 95, was one of them, watching history unfold as a young Marine. He and his comrades who live in the mainland U.S. had to watch a livestream of the ceremony from home instead of on the decks of the battleship as planned.
 "Well, I was very disappointed, yes. I was hoping to maybe see a friend or two," he said. "I just want to share with at least my family and a couple of other folks some of the feelings that I was going to express when I got there."
 Those feelings are complicated, said Pedersen, who dedicated his life to peace after the war ended.
 "War must not happen again," he said, recalling the words uttered by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the day the Japanese surrendered. But "we're still oscillating on many of the things that are necessary to bring us peace."
 Pedersen wore a blue Marine uniform recently sent to him for the ceremony as he watched the event from a laptop at his son's house in rural West Sacramento, California. His three adult children, their spouses and some grandchildren gathered around the computer, clapping and hooting when his name was called. Pedersen smiled and gave a fist pump.
 "For me, it was the end of the killing, the war that had taken millions of soldiers and many, many, many millions of civilians in wars in Europe and finally in the Pacific that came to an end that day. And we were celebrating," he told The Associated Press.
 "I had the feeling that day. I made a pact with myself that I'm going to be a peacemaker in my life," said Pedersen, who went to college after the war, got his doctorate and became a minister.
 He watched remotely as WWII-era "warbirds" flew over Pearl Harbor and video messages played from veterans and others in a tribute to those who couldn't attend or had passed away.
 Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he was honored to "commemorate and reflect on the sacrifices and victories of our service members and allies who helped fight for and secure peace."
 At the end of his keynote address, he built a case for a strong military for the future.
 "We honor the legacy of those who came before us and recommit ourselves to defending today's international rules and norms so that the road is safer and is better for generations yet to come," Esper said. "The United States' commitment to the role today is the same one we made to the freedom-loving people of the world in 1941 -- that we will remain ready to fight any foe and defend any friend."
 The U.S. entered the war after Japanese warplanes attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. Thousands of service members were killed and wounded, about half of them dying on the USS Arizona, which still sits submerged in Pearl Harbor next to the USS Missouri Memorial, a floating museum.
 Four years later, after massive losses on both sides that included the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese indicated they would surrender on Aug. 15, then met with Allied forces aboard the Missouri on Sept. 2 to sign the Instrument of Surrender.
 Hawaii Gov. David Ige said the country can learn from WWII veterans about targeting the problems of our time.
 "Some compare fighting a pandemic akin to fighting a global war," Ige said. "What I do know is that we cannot go wrong in following their example in the face of any adversity. Their courage under fire, strength of character, resilience over time provides a clear roadmap for us to follow in all that we do, whether we are fighting a social injustice or a virus."

Eleven teams of Indian and US scientists will soon start jointly scouting for "out of the box" Covid-19 solutions.
 According to a release from the Ministry of Science and Technology, "eleven teams of Indian and US scientists will soon start jointly scouting for out of the box solutions ranging from novel early diagnostic tests, antiviral therapy, drug repurposing, ventilator research, disinfection machines, and sensor-based symptom tracking for COVID 19."
 "The teams have been selected to take up these initiatives through a rigorous binational review process of proposals received for an invitation under Covid-19 Ignition Grants in April 2020 issued by the US-India Science and Technology Endowment Fund (USISTEF)," a release from the Ministry said.
 According to the release, the USISTEF announced the awards to eleven bilateral teams proposing out-of-the-box, innovative ideas to address the Covid-19 challenge. The USISTEF has been established by the Government of India (through the Department of Science & Technology) and the governments of the United States of America (through the Department of State) for the promotion of joint activities that would lead to innovation and entrepreneurship through the application of science and technology.
 "The joint U.S.-India S&T based entrepreneurial teams will work on initiatives that address the development and implementation of new technologies, tools, and systems to address Covid-19 related challenges including monitoring, diagnosis, health and safety, public outreach, information, and communication," it said.
 The release said in keeping with its' mission and vision, the USISTEF announced the Call for Proposals under the category of Covid-19 Ignition Grants with the intent to support promising joint U.S.-India S&T based entrepreneurial initiatives to address the Covid-19 challenge.
 "The mission of the United States-India Science & Technology Endowment Fund is to support and foster joint applied R&D to generate public good through the commercialization of technology developed through partnerships between U.S. and Indian researchers and entrepreneurs to help combat this pandemic," it said.

Although Steve said he's "focusing on news things," Chris is open to the idea. But the concept itself is still up in the air.
 "It's tempting to think about what a spinoff might be," he told _THR_. "We have had conversations about it and we'll see if that comes to pass. It would need to be right ... We don't want to do a series just because we want to keep the thing going or because we miss it. It would need to be a solid idea in its own right and that may happen, it may not. But it will get discussed. But it's a tall order."
 Here's to hoping it will happen! In the meantime, you can head over to Amazon Prime Video to rewatch your favorite _Modern Family_ episodes. As for reruns, you can catch episodes on ABC and USA Network (check your listings!).

The council in mid-August filed a lawsuit against the city clerk's office alleging she ignored their action to place the proposal before voters. But attorneys for Buffa claimed certification deadlines were missed for the paperwork and that's why the term limits shouldn‚Äôt be on the ballot.
 Servitto on Aug. 24 denied an order of mandamus for a declaratory judgement as requested by the City Council to place the item before voters in November.
 Elected leaders in Warren -- aside from the mayor -- are limited to three four-year terms, or a total of 12 years. That measure was approved by voters in 1998.
 But in 2016, voters approved a proposal in a primary election to let Fouts or any of the city's future mayors to serve a maximum of five four-term terms.
 The City Clerk's office certified the resolution, which was then sent by the council via email and overnight mail to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and state Attorney General Dana Nessel. The Governor's office then approved the charter amendment to be placed on the November ballot.
 The resolution was also mailed to the Macomb County Clerk's Office by the council Aug. 10, but Buffa did not mail the documents to the county despite the council resolution calling on her to do. The lawsuit stated Aug. 13 was the deadline by which the clerk was to have certified the ballot language.
 At the time, Buffa‚Äôs attorney, James Allen, said the requisite notification from the Attorney General and Governor's offices did not arrive within the statutory time frame. It would have then been illegal for Buffa to certify the documents, he said.
 However, the appeals court says the governor‚Äôs approval did arrive in time and is only an ‚Äúapproval‚Äù and not the same as ‚Äúcertification.‚Äù Whitmer‚Äôs letter to Buffa was dated Aug. 12 and was sent by email the morning of Aug. 13, the judges say. That gave Buffa enough time to submit it to the county clerk by the deadline that afternoon, the judges say.
 The appeals judges also rejected Buffa‚Äôs argument that the council could seek the ballot question again at a later election.
 ‚ÄúBuffa‚Äôs argument also ignores the reality that not all elections are equal, and that turnout at the upcoming general election, in all likelihood, surpass that of subsequent elections in 2021 or 2022,‚Äù the judges opine.
 The ruling is ‚Äúfor publication,‚Äù meaning precedent setting.
 Green noted the opinion resolves a conflict between two state laws.
 The appeals panel consisted of Kathleen Jansen, Colleen A. O‚ÄôBrien and Mark J. Cavanagh.
