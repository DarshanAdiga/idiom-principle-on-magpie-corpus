BTW, this is far from the only peaceful face-off they've had with folks down there of late -- the Kumeyaayans have been actively discouraging the further construction of the border wall on what they deem their native land, saying they've chased off some construction workers with song and dance ... or at the very least, pausing it.

The trends continued Friday night when Canyon visited Borger, which was great news for the Eagles and bad news for the Bulldogs.
   
 Canyon stayed undefeated with a third straight lopsided victory, jumping out to a big early lead and rolling to a 40-3 victory at Borger. The Bulldogs fell to 0-4 with the loss.
   
 The Eagles (3-0) took a 20-0 lead in the first quarter and never looked back, as they gave up only a second quarter field goal. They were equally dominant on both sides of the ball.
   
 Jay DeFoor had perhaps his best game at quarterback for the Eagles, completing 21-of-33 passes for 248 yards and five touchdowns. Joe Shaw and Jack McKay each caught two touchdown passes.
   
 Brody Cook opened the season with his third straight 100-yard rushing game, picking up 115 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. The Eagles piled up 405 yards of offense.
   
 Defensively, Canyon gave up only 162 yards. They took advantage of five Borger turnovers.
   
 Canyon 20 7 7 6 - 40

 Pampa (4-0) started well in taking a 31-6 halftime lead, but the Harvesters really came alive in the second half with 42 points.
   
 Jack Studebaker threw for 220 yards and four touchdowns. Two of those scores went to Hunter Dyer, who had seven catches for 110 yards.
   
 Sam Anguiano also played quarterback for Pampa and threw for a touchdown while running for two more scores.

It’s not helping matters that the West Coast has been suffering extreme heat as these fires have burned—indeed, this and other consequences of climate change are supercharging blazes, because hotter temperatures and drier brush are making wildfires burn more intensely.

Kennedy came on board and the justices ordered new arguments in four cases in which they had been split 4-4, Jan Crawford wrote in her book, "Supreme Conflict." Four hundred appeals also awaited Kennedy's review, Crawford said.
