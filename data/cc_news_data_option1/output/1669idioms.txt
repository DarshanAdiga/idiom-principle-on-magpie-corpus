The resumption of Olympians training and community sport resuming appears to rest largely on the take-up of the Federal Government’s COVID-19 safe tracing app.

Now, if you add multiple employees you might have multiple states, you may have a few more base fees. But ultimately on smaller clients the base fee can be a measurable percent of a client's bill. But as that client gets larger that base fee gets substantially distributed into the employee loss -- and the employee loss percentage becomes very close to equal to the loss of revenue percent on that client. So, it really just has to do with size of client before you could really figure out exactly how much of the base fee is in there.

When the coronavirus first started to spread across the U.S., back before schools had shuttered and before we were told to stay at home, my then 4-year- old daughter looked at me one evening after overhearing the evening news on TV.      Her lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears.      "Mommy, am I going to get that virus?" she asked.      I assured my kids that no, the virus never makes kids very sick and that it's only the very old people or people with health problems that get seriously ill. While we still need to wash our hands and be careful about symptoms, I assured my kids that everything was going to be fine. I told them that life as we know it would continue.      Looking back, only two months ago, I had no idea that we would be where we are today. If only things were as simple as washing hands.      Things hit home for me in late March, when, while texting an old friend in the New York City area about the difficulties of trying to work from home while homeschooling the kids, she told me her 10-year-old son was sick. It was COVID-19. Because of the onslaught of the virus, it was almost impossible to find any kind of disinfectant, masks or gloves. The family had been staying home, much like we all are, and yet their son still got sick.      My kids started praying for the boy every night. I had some masks, extra Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer that I had bought back in February, and we packed them up, along with candy and homemade get-well cards that my kids made, and shipped the box to Brooklyn. Thankfully, the boy's symptoms were fairly mild, and after two weeks, the fever dissipated and he recovered.      But not every child has been so lucky.      Last week, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert in Michigan became the first child in the U.S. to die of COVID-19. Like so many other girls her age, like my own 5-year- old daughter - she loved dressing up and performing and loved all things "bling." A kindergartner, she loved going to school and began reading when she was only 4.      But last month she started complaining of headaches, the Washington Post reported. And within days she was hospitalized with COVID-19. She developed a rare form of meningitis, suffered from brain swelling and eventually was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She did not survive.      She did not have any underlying health conditions.      The majority of the COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been people who are over age 60 or people who have underlying health conditions. But there have also been critical cases among the young and people without underlying health conditions who have also ended up on ventilators and some who have died.      According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 21,050 COVID-19 deaths as of April 22. Three of the deaths were in children age 14 and younger, 21 deaths in people age 24 and younger, and 585 of the people who died were between 25 and 44.      There is no sure way of knowing how many people ended up on a ventilator and survived, or how many people have actually had the virus. Without widespread testing, we won't really know how many people have antibodies or how many people have the virus but are asymptomatic.      In the last couple of weeks, people have protested across the country, saying that businesses should re-open and stay-at-home orders should be lifted for the sake of the economy and their personal rights to do business as they please. While states like Georgia have started to lift their business closures, despite not yet reaching a peak on COVID-19 cases, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced last week that she will not lift the statewide stay-at-home order yet.   When she lifts the restrictions, Ivey said the decision will be based on data. Currently, the state is testing about 1% of the population for COVID-19, and Alabama doesn't have enough information right now about the number of cases out there to lift the stay-at-home order, Ivey said.   For that, I applaud her. I understand the need to reopen the economy and get back to a somewhat normal life. I look forward to the day when I can go back to work and my kids can go back to school. But until we are able to conduct widespread testing to know who for sure has the virus and how many people may be immune, we don't need to rush reopening business as usual, just for the sake of it.      Lives matter, lives like little Skylar Herbert. Lives like my kids', my husband's, our parents, my neighbors - lives like yours. Right now, without a clearer picture of cases, it's too much to risk.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

While COVID-19 restrictions have brought New Bern's economic and social life to a virtual standstill, one area where activity has actually increased is work on the city's parks and recreation infrastructure.
   
 With many facilities closed, workers have been able to do needed repairs and upgrades on an accelerated timeline, said New Bern Parks and Recreation Director Foster Hughes.
   
 "We're using several contractors for a variety of projects that we're doing and that has been the biggest difference, everyone has been eager to get some work done for us, as opposed to two months ago having to wait and wait. And with our parks being open but some of our amenities being closed, it's allowed us to actually get a lot of projects completed. So at least that has been a positive for us during this bad situation," said Hughes.
   
 Hughes said the one negative impact of COVID-19 on the city's park and rec work has been the inability of inspectors to visit sites.
   
 "Any state inspections we had scheduled, the inspectors have not been able to come out," said Hughes.

 At New Bern's largest parks and rec project, Martin Marietta Park, contractors are preparing to complete work on a restroom and the construction of the park's first shelter, which should be finished in the next few weeks, said Hughes.
   
 "Then we're going to start on our playground and another shelter and restroom project out there," he explained.
   
 Hughes said the first phase of work at Martin Marietta Park is still on schedule to be completed this summer.
   
 "I talked with our water resources department yesterday and they're getting ready to start installing water and sewer lines out there. Then we'll be starting on a playground and another larger shelter and restroom combo," said Hughes. "Then we'll be working on some of the trails then some of the observation platforms and things like that. So I feel very good about our first phase being ready for the public to enjoy this summer."
   
 Hughes said workers have also been able to convert four tennis courts at West New Bern Recreation Center into two tennis courts and six pickle ball courts, which will open once Governor Roy Cooper begins lifting restrictions, said Hughes. He said the gym has also been repainted and new tile flooring added at West New Bern Recreation as well.
   
 Renovation work is also being done at Fort Totten playground, with the repainting of swings and laying of new mulch.
   
 "We've been able to see a lot of projects actually be implemented and completed at this time, also a lot of playground renovations we have been working on," said Hughes.
   
 Ongoing Hurricane Florence repair projects to park bridge and floating dock are also moving forward, he noted. Hughes said a contractor who has been selected to repair the docks at Union Point Park will also restore the walkway at Lawson Creek that was torn apart during the storm.
   
 "I see all that being completed probably within two months," said Hughes.
   
 Like everyone else, New Bern Parks and recreation staff have been taking precautions against COVID-19.
   
 "Everyone is practicing social distancing and a lot of our staff members are wearing masks," he said. "Of course, we're not letting the public come into our offices but we are teleconferencing with the public as we need to with meetings and if they're registering for programs we're working that out to where they can drop a registration off at our facility or register online."
   
 While the work at parks and recreation facilities has been a bright spot amid the COVID-19 disruptions, Hughes said the impact on activities, such as festivals and concerts, remains to be seen.
   
 "There's a lot of unknowns for what we're going to be doing, as far as how this is going to affect opening our recreation centers, our summer camps and swimming pools," he said. "And also our special events, our concert series and Fourth of July, so we've got a lot of things up in the air right now. Hopefully on May 8 when the governor determines whether or not he's going to lift this or extend, hopefully we'll get some more clarification so we can move forward with some of our plans."

Great. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate your comments about most of the impact you're seeing so far is in the reduction of employees at your clients' account. But I suspect that as this situation extends there is the risk of higher churn just from macroeconomic volatility. So I'm just wondering, you've done a great job over the years improving retention, is there anything specific you're putting in place to help improve or keep retention up even in these uncertain times?

Canon USA has just released new software that may help some users overcome the global webcam shortage caused by an increase in demand due to Covid-19. In fact, the lockdown rules in most countries have also increased our dependency on video calls for personal reasons as well – whether via Zoom , Skype or Google Hangouts – and for many who already own a webcam, the video quality may not be up to scratch, especially in low light. While it's possible to set up a camera you own to double as a…

I mean, really for retention, if you're talking about the actual loss of a client that might go out of business other than helping them find resources that might help them stay in business, there's not a whole lot of impact we can make there. Now, what I will say is even at IPO, we announced that 90% of our revenue is derived from companies that have greater than 50 employees. And so today, that's only going to be greater than that as far as a percent of revenue. My bet is it's -- well, it's much higher than 90% at this point and so for us, what we're seeing is more a decrease not a go away.
