Valencia's Argentinian centre-back Ezequiel Garay said on Sunday he had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first player in the Spanish Liga known to have the disease.
 "It's clear that 2020 has started on the wrong foot," he posted on Instagram alongside a smiling selfie giving the thumbs up. "I tested positive for coronavirus, I feel very well and now all that's left is to do what the health authorities say, which is to isolate myself."
 Garay, 33, was in the stands on Tuesday for the Champions League round-of-16 second leg match behind closed doors at the Mestalla where Valencia lost 4-3 to Atalanta, who are from Bergamo in Lombardy, and were eliminated by an aggregate score of 8-4.
 By Sunday morning, Spain had recorded 6,391 cases and 196 deaths.

Virgil Van Dijk fears Liverpool will be forced to celebrate their first English title for 30 years in an empty stadium as a result of coronavirus chaos.
 All Premier League games have been postponed until at least April 3 due to the spread of the global pandemic.
 Premier League chiefs are set to meet on Thursday to discuss if it will be possible to continue the season and, if so, in what format.
 Games could be played behind closed doors, which would mean Liverpool, who are 25 points clear of second placed Manchester City, winning the title without their fans being present.
 That is a depressing prospect for Liverpool defender Van Dijk.
 "If we won it in an empty stadium and the fans weren't there, I'd be gutted for them," he told several British newspapers on Sunday.
 "Obviously, if there are no fans at Anfield, then it will be a bit of a blow. No one wants to play games without the fans.
 "Until a decision is made on how we go on from here, then we just have to deal with it. But when it happens, we are still bringing the title to our fans, definitely."
 Liverpool could have wrapped up the title on Monday with a win at Everton if Manchester City were beaten by Burnley on Saturday, but both those games were postponed, along with the rest of the Premier League programme.
 Some have suggested the season should be scrapped for safety reason, which would leave Premier League chiefs to decide if Liverpool should be given the title even though the campaign did not reach its scheduled 38-game conclusion.
 Sport is expected to be subjected to further restrictions next week, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly ready to announce a ban on major public gatherings.
 The sporting programme has once again been decimated on Sunday, although the Super League match between Castleford and St Helens, the All England badminton Championship and Olympic boxing qualifiers are still going ahead in Britain.

Former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney claims the British government and football authorities have treated players like "guinea pigs" during the coronavirus crisis.
 While the rest of European football was shutting down due to the growing threat of the global pandemic, Rooney is angry it took several days for the Premier League and Football League to postpone their matches until April 3.
 It was only when Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for the virus on Friday that football's UK governing bodies called a temporary halt to the season.
 Rooney, currently playing for second tier Derby, felt they should have acted quicker and the former England captain said he would "never forgive" the authorities if his family fell ill as a result.
 "Why did we wait until Friday? Why did it take Mikel Arteta to get ill for the game in England to do the right thing?" Rooney wrote in the Sunday Times.
 "For players, staff and their families it has been a worrying week - one in which you felt a lack of leadership from the government and from the FA and Premier League.
 "After the emergency meeting, at last the right decision was made - until then it almost felt like footballers in England were being treated like guinea pigs.
 "I know how I feel. If any of my family get infected through me because I've had to play when it's not safe, and they get seriously ill, I'd have to think hard about ever playing again. I would never forgive the authorities."
 Many matches at non-league level were going ahead as scheduled in Britain this weekend and Rooney believes Prime Minister Boris Johnson "dodged" the issue by letting football make its own decision about playing on.
 The 34-year-old claimed money was key to the authorities' reluctance to cancel games.
 "The rest of sport - tennis, Formula One, rugby, golf, football in other countries - was closing down and we were being told to carry on," Rooney said.
 "I think a lot of footballers were wondering, 'Is it something to do with money being involved in this?'"
 Once the virus is under control, Rooney wants a radical schedule shake-up which could see the current season being concluded as late as September, and the next two kicking off in winter-time as a result.
 "We're happy to play until September if the season extends to then, if that's how it has to be. That's our job. As long as we know we're safe to play and it's a safe environment for spectators, we'll play," Rooney said.
 "The next World Cup is in November and December 2022, so you could actually use this situation as an opportunity and say we're going to finish the 2019-20 season later this year, then prepare for 2022 by having the next two seasons starting in winter."

Die Eishockey-Weltmeisterschaft in der Schweiz wird aufgrund der Coronavirus- Pandemie immer unwahrscheinlicher.
 „Die Zeichen verdichten sich, dass das Turnier nicht stattfindet. Aber jetzt wäre es für eine definitive Absage noch zu früh“, sagte der Präsident des Weltverbandes IIHF, René Fasel, der Nachrichtenagentur Keystone-SDA. „Ich gehe davon aus, dass wir bezüglich der WM spätestens in zwei Wochen Klarheit haben.“
 Das Turnier mit der deutschen Nationalmannschaft von Bundestrainer Toni Söderholm und insgesamt 16 Teilnehmern, darunter auch das besonders betroffene Italien, ist eigentlich für den 8. bis 24. Mai in Zürich und Lausanne geplant.
 Für Dienstag hat der Weltverband eine Telefonkonferenz zu dem Thema angesetzt. Fasel sagte aber, dass es nicht in den Händen der IIHF liege, ob die WM durchgeführt wird oder nicht. „Der Entscheid liegt nicht bei uns, sondern bei Bund und Kantonen. Noch arbeiten wir so weiter, dass ab dem 8. Mai in Zürich und Lausanne gespielt werden könnte. Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt.“
 Normalerweise findet die WM jährlich statt, für das Turnier in der Schweiz wurden bereits mehr als 300 000 Tickets abgesetzt. Etliche andere Turniere hat der Weltverband bereits gestrichen. Die meisten Ligen, darunter auch die Deutsche Eishockey Liga, haben ihren Spielbetrieb bereits beendet. In der NHL ist die Saison unterbrochen. „Ich erwarte keine lange Diskussion, weil die Fakten und die Dimensionen dieses Virus' in der Welt sich noch dramatisch ins Negative wenden werden“, hatte der deutsche Verbandspräsident Franz Reindl, der auch im Council der IIHF sitzt, zuvor gesagt.
