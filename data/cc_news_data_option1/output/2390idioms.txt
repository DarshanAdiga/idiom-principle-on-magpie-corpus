He was PNC, part of PNC and served as the longest serving Finance Minister for seven (7) consecutive years in the PNC Party government.   He resigned from PNC Party and lied to this country and her people that he didn't want to be part of a corrupt O'Neill government. However, to date he has not produced one single evidence and or laid one single complaint with Ombudsman Commission or Police National Fraud and Anti Corruption Directorate on his claims.   He was never genuine from the start. He said he only wanted to remove O'Neill and never wanted to be PM. However, in Laguna camp, he forced himself by putting his name down on VONC Motion Paper has the candidate for PM hoping that he will attract the numbers. Needless to say, he never attracted numbers and so fall short of the required majority (magic number) which is 56 MPs.   In failing his bid, he then went t…

The United Nations food agency warned Thursday that without immediate funding its global transport system will stop delivering thousands of tonnes of masks, gloves and other critical equipment to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic to 132 countries by the third week of July.Amer Daoudi, the World Food Program's director of operations and Covid-19 response, told a video press conference that its aircraft have also transported 2,600 humanitarian and health workers free of charge to 40 destinations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East since the pandemic began, and that service will also come to a halt.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"As the virus continues to accelerate across many parts of the world, as we are seeing, these services become more and more vital and important," he said.To meet the demand, he said the Rome-based WFP requested $965 million to sustain its transport services through 2020.But so far it has received about $132 million -- only 14 percent -- even though "the Covid-19 virus is not slowing down" and "the entire humanitarian and health community is relying on WFP's logistic services now more than ever," Daoudi said."WFP services are expanding and demand is increasing. However, the funding is not," he said. "With this funding level, the WFP common services will come to a standstill by the third week of July." Daoudi said WFP has eight Covid-19 response hubs around the world connected by a global network of air and sea transport that so far have dispatched 15,000 cubic meters (about 530,000 cubic feet) of critical items to tackle the coronavirus to 132 countries on behalf of health and humanitarian organizations.He said, for example, that one cubic meter (about 35 cubic feet) contains "around 32,500 surgical masks, 1,650 safety goggles, 1,800 face shields and/or 30,000 examination gloves." Daoudi said 70,000 cubic meters (about 2.47 million cubic feet) of cargo are in the pipeline to be transported over the next six weeks on behalf of more than 30 organizations. To do that, he said, between 120 and 130 large 747 cargo planes are needed, because each can only carry 650 cubic meters (about 23,000 cubic feet)."And this is only the tip of the iceberg," he said. "Moving beyond the next six weeks the demand is quite huge and we are talking about delivering to over 132 different countries across the globe, so the urgency is there, the needs are there." D aoudi said "projections indicate that approximately upwards of 700,000 cubic meters (almost 25 million cubic feet) of cargo will need to be delivered across the world by the end of the year." But he said that will be impossible unless WFP receives $820 million to continue its Covid-19 logistics service through 2020.Daoudi welcomed "generous donations of air transport capacity" from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union as part of its air bridge, and said WFP is in discussions with NATO, the United Kingdom and other countries about offering air assets. WFP's two strategic hubs for Covid-19 deliveries are in Guangzhou, China and Liege, Belgium, along with six regional hubs in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Panama, he said.Daoudi said WFP has been providing passenger transport services for health and humanitarian workers where safe and reliable commercial options are not available."WFP is working to open more passenger routes in Latin America and add destinations throughout Africa, Asia and the Middle East," he said. "The moment there are commercial viable options WFP will stand down its services."

La actriz mexicana Karla Souza presentó a su segundo hijo, Luka, quien nació el pasado viernes en Los Ángeles (EE.UU.). “A Luka le dio la bienvenida en casa su hermana mayor de dos años, Gianna, quien ya está ocupada enseñándole la letra de la canción ‘Un poco loco’ de ‘Coco’ (2017)”, contó a la revista People, que publicó una imagen de la madre junto a su niño recién nacido. Es el segundo hijo que tiene la mexicana con su esposo Marshall Trenkmann, con quien se casó en 2014. Souza había anunciado en mayo que estaba embarazada con una publicación en Instagram, donde tiene 3,9 millones de seguidores, en la que aparecía con su hija Gianna en brazos. La mexicana ha estrenado recientemente la serie “El presidente“ en Amazon Prime sobre el escándalo conocido coloquialmente como “FIFA Gate“. “Mi personaje fue creado para simbolizar a todos los investigadores del FBI que estuvieron involucrados en el caso”, indicó en una entrevista con Efe hace un par de semanas. “Se sabe muy poco sobre cómo se llevó a cabo la investigación o quiénes estuvieron involucrados por parte del FBI. Por eso se decidió hacer un personaje que tuviera la capacidad de transformarse en diferentes personas, con facilidad para los idiomas y que tuviera elementos masculinos y femeninos”, añadió. La actriz de películas muy exitosas como “Nosotros los nobles“ (2012) o “Instructions Not Included“ (2013) también se despidió recientemente de “How to Get Away with Murder“, la serie protagonizada por Viola Davis con la que la latina se abrió hueco de manera muy importante dentro de la industria estadounidense. “¡Ha sido un honor trabajar y aprender de Viola Davis en los últimos años! Más allá de su incomparable don y compromiso con este arte, es también una fuerza de generosidad y amabilidad”, aseguró en Instagram en mayo acerca de una serie en la que dio vida a Laurel Castillo y que cerró su andadura hace un mes tras seis temporadas.

Scientists at the University of Manchester have developed a new type of smart textile that could make its way into adaptive clothing that keeps the wearer cool in warm weather, and vice versa. The material achieves this through the use of graphene which can be tuned to alter the thermal radiation of the textile, with the team imagining the technology could also find its way into advanced displays and even spacesuits.
 The breakthrough builds on previous work from the same research team, in which they harnessed the incredible abilities of graphene to produce a thermal camouflage to hide a wearer’s heat from infrared cameras. That material worked through a small electrical current that feeds onto layers of graphene embedded in the material.
 This has the effect of altering the amount of infrared radiation emitted through the material’s surface, which, in one demonstration, enabled it to be tuned to mask the thermal signature of a person’s hand from an infrared camera. Now the team is eyeing more of an active role for its tuneable textile.
 The warmer the human body, the more infrared radiation it emits, so some clothes are designed to allow this radiation to pass through freely to help keep the body temperature low, while others are designed to lock it in to keep the wearer warm. The team has now adapted its smart textile to perform the role of both, with the ability to dynamically transition between these two states via electrical tuning.
 “Ability to control the thermal radiation is a key necessity for several critical applications such as temperature management of the body in excessive temperature climates,” says Professor Coskun Kocabas, who led the research. “Thermal blankets are a common example used for this purpose. However, maintaining these functionalities as the surroundings heats up or cools down has been an outstanding challenge.”
 The team demonstrated this dynamic thermal radiation control by creating a prototype garment with the active device featuring as a patch on the chest that could be switched on and off as desired. But the scientists imagine that this capability could be leveraged to serve all kinds of purposes, featuring in interactive displays or even adaptive space suits. In the near-term, the team hopes to explore its potential in addressing the extreme temperature fluctuations facing satellites in orbit.
 “The next step for this area of research is to address the need for dynamic thermal management of Earth-orbiting satellites,” says said Kocabas. “Satellites in orbit experience excesses of temperature, when they face the Sun and they freeze in the Earth’s shadow. Our technology could enable dynamic thermal management of satellites by controlling the thermal radiation and regulate the satellite temperature on demand.”
 The research was published in the journal _Nano Letters._

Truth to tell, Gold would much rather kill than capture Teague, and takes little comfort in knowing his bitter enemy likely will spend the rest of his life behind bars after being snatched from his secluded hideaway. Still, Gold grudgingly accepts the job of leading the younger, less-experienced but not entirely unqualified Lynch (Phoebe Robinson-Galvin) and Shapiro (Sam Benjamin) on an assignment to grab Teague and spirit him off to an airfield from which he’ll be transported to the slammer.

A man (40) has died in Assam due to head injuries sustained while trying to flee from a quarantine centre after he came to know that he has tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive.The deceased, who had recently returned from Odisha, where he was working, amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions, was quarantined at a makeshift facility in a school near his native village in Bongaigaon district."The deceased and another person tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday. He was informed about it and an ambulance was sent to transfer both these patients to a hospital," said MS Lakshmi Priya, deputy commissioner (DC), Bongaigaon."When the ambulance reached the quarantine centre, the other person boarded the vehicle. But the man, who had recently returned from Odisha, gave an excuse that he would need to collect some of his stuff from the quarantine centre. He tried to scale a wall of the centre in a bid to escape. Unfortunately, he slipped and sustained severe head injuries," the DC added.He was immediately shifted to the medical college hospital in neighbouring Barpeta district, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). He died on Thursday."Even though he had tested Covid-19 positive, he didn't die due to symptoms related to the viral outbreak. His death won't be counted as a Covid-19 fatality," the DC said."This is an unfortunate incident and the deceased would definitely have recovered from the viral disease within a few days. We've no idea why he took such an extreme step. We're taking extra care of all those who are under institutional quarantine in the district," she added.His last rites were performed at his native village in Bongaigaon district on Thursday, as per the central government's strict guidelines of disposing of bodies of Covid-19 patients.Bongaigaon district has recorded 65 Covid-19 positive cases until Thursday.Around 7,000 people working in other states have returned to the district in the past 45 days since the ban on inter-state movement was lifted.Assam has recorded 4,862 Covid-19 positive cases till Thursday, including 2,849 patients have recovered and nine deaths.Over 2.91 lakh people have returned to the state from other states in the north-east and the rest of the country since May 4.

Britain's budget deficit swelled further in May, taking debt as a percentage of GDP above 100% for the first time since the financial year ending 1963.Borrowing stood at 55.2 billion pounds ($69 billion) last month, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. It brings the total since the start of the fiscal year in April to 103.7 billion pounds, the biggest two- month total on record.The increase reflect the cost of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's unprecedented interventions to help prop up the economy, and the deficit is likely to swell further this year. The government is currently paying the wages for almost 12 million jobs and more stimulus including tax breaks and infrastructure projects potentially in the pipeline.May's number was the highest single month for borrowing on record, after April's record figures was revised down to 48.5 billion.Both numbers are still well above any figure before the virus hit, with monthly borrowing never exceeding 22 billion pounds even in the depths of the financial crisis.Net debt including Bank of England programs jumped to 100.9% of GDP.

Walz went further in highlighting the potential historic ramifications of ending the special session without passing additional policing law changes.
 "The image of us and the Senate walking away from systemic change on Juneteenth adds to the legacy of what the rest of the world is looking at here," Walz said. "It is unacceptable. We have demanded systemic change, the work has been done, the coalitions have been built and it's our expectation that those bills will make it through the House this afternoon, they will go to the Senate and they will be on our desk."
 Senate Majority Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, on Thursday held a news conference of his own to respond to the comments. He touted the measures the Senate passed following tense debates around race and the lack of inclusion of lawmakers of color in that chamber.
 “They want to imply that we are doing nothing and that flat out is not true and frankly dishonesty is not good for Minnesota,” Gazelka said. “We’re actually trying to work together. We’re trying to pass things that everybody agrees with."
 Gazelka said senators were still in conversations about policing law changes and responses to the "lawlessness" that followed Floyd's death as looting and arson fires sprung up across Minneapolis and St. Paul. Republicans have said they oppose efforts to expand the attorney general's authority to investigate deadly force encounters and allow felons to vote after completing their time behind bars.
