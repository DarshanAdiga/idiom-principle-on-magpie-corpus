PRODIGAL SON follows MALCOLM BRIGHT (Tom Payne), a criminal profiler with a rare talent for getting inside the minds of killers. He learned how they think because his father, DR. MARTIN WHITLY (Michael Sheen), was a notorious serial killer known as "The Surgeon." Now he's using his twisted genius to help the NYPD solve their most puzzling murders. Bright's team, led by his longtime mentor, NYPD Lieutenant GIL ARROYO (Lou Diamond Phillips), includes Detectives DANI POWELL (Aurora Perrineau), JT TARMEL (Frank Harts) and medical examiner DR. EDRISA TANAKA (Keiko Agena). Season Two picks up with Bright's personal life in disarray after his sister AINSLEY's (Halston Sage) shocking actions in the Season One finale. Now, he must "take care" of her and protect his mother JESSICA WHITLY (Bellamy Young) from a secret that could tear THE FAMILY apart all over again! Further complicating matters, Martin seeks to deepen his relationship with Bright, his prodigal son, but forging this bond leads to shocking twists and revelations.

BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission should give its decision by Monday evening on the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which should pave the wave for vaccinations to begin across the 27 EU countries this year.
 After the European Medicines Agency gave its green light to the COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, the EU's chief executive Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission would act quickly.
 "Now we will act fast. I expect a European Commission decision by this evening," she wrote on Twitter. (Reporting by Marine Strauss @StraussMarine; editing by Philip Blenkinsop)

JOHANNESBURG, Dec 21 (Reuters) - At least five countries and airlines, including Germany and Turkey, are reported to have banned flights from South Africa on Monday over the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus.
 South Africa's health department said last week that a new genetic mutation of COVID-19 had been found in the country and may be responsible for a recent surge in infections.
 Online South African publication Business Insider said that Israel, Turkey, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland had all halted air travel to and from South Africa.
 Reuters could not immediately confirm all the reported bans.
 Germany said it planned to impose restrictions on flights from and to South Africa and Britain, where the new strain has also been identified.
 El Salvador on Sunday said it was banning travellers who have been in either country in the last 30 days or whose flights included a layover in them.
 European airline SWISS said it was halting all passenger flights from the two countries "due to the new epidemiological situation" from midnight until further notice.
 Rogan Cowan from Cape Town had been due to fly with his wife to Luxembourg on Boxing Day to begin a new job as an analyst at an asset management firm.

 "This has thrown us upside down. I'm just trying to figure out what's happening... I haven't even thought about all the knock on effects," Cowan said.
 Aviation experts said they expected more airlines and countries to follow suit, at least until more was known.

General manager Marty Hurney was fired by the Carolina Panthers.
 Hurney was in a second stint as GM of the franchise and was previously dismissed in 2012.
 Owner David Tepper said Monday it became evident in recent discussions with Hurney that a new direction was necessary, adding he has thoughts on the best candidates for the position.
 "I think sometimes you just need a restart, a refresh," Tepper said. "We did it last year on the coaching side. Maybe you could say it should have been done before on the GM side. Maybe it should have been. I'm sure people may say that, or otherwise, on both sides. I think it's just time, on both sides, to do that. It just seems like the right time to move forward."
 The Panthers, 4-10, are in their first season under head coach Matt Rhule. Depth and injuries have been factors in the team's record, but Tepper said he believes Carolina could have a few more wins.
 Tepper said he will include Rhule in the GM search in hopes of aligning his management structure.
 "You look at successful organizations, and there's a certain alignment between the head coach and the GM," Tepper said. "To think that you can do that without some sort of alignment is nuts. So to not have a head coach with some input into that is stupid. I don't want to be stupid, OK?"
 Hurney was first named general manager in 2002, having been promoted from his role as personnel director. He had an immediate hand in developing the rosters that advanced to two Super Bowls -- Super Bowls XXXVIII and 50 -- including drafting one-time franchise cornerstones Cam Newton and Luke Kuechly.
 Fired in 2012, Hurney returned from a sports radio role in 2017 and helped hire Rhule away from Baylor last offseason.

"We recognize that many people who identify with Indigenous nations and communities have been disconnected from their communities and cultural ties due to the impacts of colonial assimilationist practices and policies," the organization said in a statement.
 "In the spirit of caring and understanding, we support those individuals who are doing the work of reclaiming and being claimed. However, Indigeneity needs to be affirmed by the community before accessing opportunities and resources meant to mitigate colonial impacts experienced by Indigenous peoples and communities.
 Latimer has worked on many Indigenous-focused projects throughout her career.
 The founder of the Toronto-based independent production company Streel Films was the showrunner, writer and director of the Indigenous resistance series "Rise,'' which aired on Viceland and APTN.
 The filmmaker says in order to address the mistake, she's reached out to elders and community historians in Kitigan Zibi, and the surrounding areas, to receive guidance and obtain verification.
 She says she's also hired a professional genealogist to understand her family history, and is listening to the advice of an Indigenous community of peers.
 "At this point, on paper, I can formally trace through source documentation, one line of our Indigenous ancestry dating back to the 1700's,'' Latimer wrote in the statement issued Thursday.
 "I have met with leadership from the community this ancestry directly ties to, and they have verified my family connections and confirmed that this is an accepted ancestral line.''

How this process takes place at the molecular level is not yet well understood. What is now clear, however, is that not only chemistry plays a role in the docking of antigens to the T-cell; micromechanical effects are important too. Submicrometer structures on the cell surface act like microscopic tension springs. Tiny forces that occur as a result are likely to be of great importance for the recognition of antigens. At TU Wien, it has now been possible to observe these forces directly using highly developed microscopy methods.

Even as the government has temporarily suspended flights to and from the UK amid concerns of an out of control new variant of coronavirus spreading COVID-19 at a much faster pace in parts of England, 50 per cent of the respondents of a survey wants air bubble agreement with some other countries to be put on-hold. Besides, as many as 41 per cent of the respondents wanted mandatory 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving from impacted countries -- the UK, South Africa, the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia, said online platform LocalCircles on Monday. The findings are based on over 7,000 responses received from citizens across 202 districts for the survey, which was conducted between Sunday evening and Monday morning, it said. The government has just announced a ban on all flights from the United Kingdom from midnight December 22nd till December 31st in light of the new virus mutation that has been reported in London and several parts of the United Kingdom, LocalCircles said in a release. Followed by many nations like Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium imposing a ban on the flights from the UK, as a precautionary measure, citizens of India had been raising the demand for the government to impose a similar ban on flights from the UK, it said. This is a fast and decisive action on part of the government and citizens are appreciative of the same. India has come a long way and cases have reduced from almost 90,000 a day in September to 25,000 a day. By acting on this, India can hopefully ensure that the downward trajectory continuesrdquo, said Sachin Taparia, Founder amp Chairman, LocalCircles. Also, the approach of a flight ban that lasts nine days only for now makes sense to see how the situation develops and a call for resumption or ban extension can be taken on December 31st, he added. Basis feedback from citizens, LocalCircles initiated a survey seeking inputs from citizens on the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus and governments approach on the bubble flights, said the release. Notably, 50 per cent citizens want bubble flights from impacted countries suspended, while 41 per cent want mandatory 14-day quarantine for arriving passengers instead. Only six per cent of citizens voted that India should continue with current rules treating flights from these countries similar to others, it said. India followed Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Bulgaria, the Irish Republic, Turkey, Canada and Hong Kong in suspending flights. France became the latest European country to close all its borders with Britain. Based on the feedback from citizens, LocalCircles escalated the findings of this survey with senior leadership of the Central Government for immediate consideration. According to a civil aviation ministry statement, all flights originating from the UK to India will be temporarily suspended until 1159 pm on December 31, with the suspension to start from 11.59 pm on December 22

NEW YORK — A federal advisory panel recommended Sunday that people 75 and older and essential workers like firefighters, teachers and grocery store workers should be next in line for COVID-19 shots, while a second vaccine began rolling out to hospitals as the nation works to get the coronavirus pandemic under control.
 The two developments came amid a vaccination program that began only in the last week and has given initial shots to about 556,000 Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech already is being distributed, and regulators last week gave approval to the one from Moderna Inc. that began shipping Sunday.
 Earlier this month, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said health care workers and nursing home residents — about 24 million people — should be at the very front of the line for the vaccines.
 Sunday’s vote by the panel was who should be next in line, and by a vote of 13-1, it decided that it should be people 75 and older, who number about 20 million, as well as certain front-line workers, who total about 30 million.
 The essential workers include firefighters and police; teachers and school staff; those working in food, agricultural and manufacturing sectors; corrections workers; U.S. Postal Service employees; public transit workers; and grocery store workers. They are considered at very high risk of infection because their jobs are critical and require them to be in regular contact with other people.
 It’s not clear how long it will take to vaccinate those groups. Vaccine doses have come out slower than earlier projections. But at the same time, some experts noted that not everyone who is recommended to get vaccinated may choose to get a shot.
 The committee also voted that behind those groups should be people aged 65 to 74, numbering about 30 million; those aged 16 to 64 with medical conditions like obesity and cancer who are at higher risk if they get COVID-19, numbering as many as 110 million; and a tier of other essential workers. This group of as many as 57 million includes a wide category of food service and utility workers but also those in legal and financial jobs and the media.
 The expert panel’s recommendation next goes to the CDC director and to states as guidance to put together vaccination programs. CDC directors have almost always signed off on committee recommendations. No matter what the CDC says, there will be differences from state to state, because various health departments have different ideas about who should be closer to the front of the line.
 Federal officials expect that vaccine doses will be limited for several months. CDC officials say up to 20 million are projected to start getting shots this month, another 30 million next month, and 50 million in February. That’s 100 million out of a population of more than 330 million.
 Pfizer’s shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used the next day, kicking off the nation’s biggest vaccination drive.
 Public health experts say the shots — and others in the pipeline — are the only way to stop a virus that has been spreading wildly. Nationwide, more than 219,000 people per day on average test positive for the virus, which has killed over 316,000 in the U.S. and nearly 1.7 million worldwide.
 Earlier Sunday, trucks left the Olive Branch, Mississippi, factory, near Memphis, Tennessee, with the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. The much-needed shots are expected to be given starting Monday, just three days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency rollout.
 In Louisville, Kentucky, UPS driver Todd Elble said his vaccine shipment was the “most important load that I’ve hauled” in a 37-year career. His parents contracted COVID-19 in November, and his 78-year-old father died. He said the family speculates that his father got infected while traveling on a hunting trip with four other relatives to Wyoming, and some are still sick.
 “I’m going to take the vaccine myself. I’m going to be first in line for my father — I’ll tell you that much — and any others that should follow,” he said. “I feel in my heart that everybody should, to help get this stopped.”
 He added: “To bring this back, I feel Dad was in the truck with me today.”
 Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser to the federal government’s vaccine distribution effort, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that nearly 8 million doses will be distributed Monday, about 5.9 million of the Moderna vaccine and 2 million of the Pfizer vaccine.
 Slaoui also predicted the U.S. will experience “a continuing surge,” with larger numbers of coronavirus cases possible from gatherings for Christmas.
 “I think, unfortunately, it will get worse,” he said.
 There won’t be enough shots for the general population until spring, so doses will be rationed at least for the next several months. President-elect Joe Biden pledged earlier this month to have 100 million doses distributed in his first 100 days in office, and his surgeon general nominee said Sunday that it’s still a realistic goal.
 But Vivek Murthy told NBC’s “Meet the Press” it’s more realistic to think it may be midsummer or early fall before vaccines are available to the general public, rather than late spring. Murthy said Biden’s team is working toward having the shots available to lower-risk individuals by late spring but doing so requires “everything to go exactly on schedule.”
 Meanwhile, Trump’s surgeon general, Jerome Adams, defended the administration’s handling of the Pfizer vaccine Sunday, a day after the Army general charge of getting COVID-19 vaccines across the U.S. apologized Saturday for “miscommunication” with states over the number of doses to be delivered in the early stages of distribution. At least a dozen states reported they would receive a smaller second shipment of the Pfizer vaccine than they had been told previously.
 Gen. Gustave Perna told reporters in a telephone briefing that he made mistakes by citing numbers of doses that he believed would be ready. Slaoui said the mistake was assuming vaccines that had been produced were ready for shipment when there was a two-day delay.
 “And unless it’s perfectly right, we will not release vaccine doses for usage,” he said. “And, sometimes, there could be small hiccups. There have been none, actually, in manufacturing now. The hiccup was more into the planning.”
 But Adams told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “the numbers are going to go up and down.”
 “It absolutely was not poor planning,” he said. “There’s what we plan. There’s what we actually allocate. There’s what’s delivered, and then there’s what’s actually put in people’s arms.”
 Adams, who is Black, said he understands that mistrust of the medical community and the vaccine among Blacks “comes from a real place,” the mistreatment of communities of color. He cited the decades-long Tuskegee experiment in Alabama, where Black men with syphilis were not treated so the disease could be studied.
 He also said immigrants in the U.S. illegally should not be denied the vaccine because of their legal status because “it’s not ethically right to deny those individuals.”
 “I want to reassure people that your information when collected to get your second shot, if you get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, will not be used in any way, shape or form to harm you legally,” Adams said. “That is something that I have been assured of.”
 Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart. The second dose must be from the same company as the first. Both vaccines appeared safe and strongly protective in large, still unfinished studies.

La noche del domingo 20 de diciembre se puso fin a una etapa en el noticiero de América Televisión “Cuarto Poder”. Sol Carreño y Augusto Thorndike se despidieron del espacio periodístico tras anunciar que su contrato había terminado. Vale resaltar que Augusto Thorndike entró al programa en el 2014 para unirse a Sol Carreño, quien cumplió 15 años en el noticiero este 2020. “No quiero decir nombres, creo que lo has dicho todos, porque cada vez que uno dice nombres, corre el riesgo de olvidarse alguno” respondió Sol luego de la breve despedida de su compañero y continuó con su discurso. Quiero agradecerles, primero a ustedes que están al otro lado de la cámara, por estos 15 hermosos años en los que tuve la oportunidad de acompañarlos y en los que ustedes me acompañaron. Quiero agradecer al canal porque me permitió hacer algo, aunque ha sido pequeño, por este país que a veces nos duele tanto. Quiero agradecer obviamente a todo el equipo de ‘Cuarto Poder’ que me hizo el honor de dar la cara por todos ustedes, porque eso es lo que hicimos, dar la cara por un enorme equipo. Y ese equipo incluye reporteros, camarógrafos, choferes, editores, asistentes, no voy a decir nombres porque como ya les dije, son muchas personas. Yo quiero referirme a algunos rumores. No nos vamos de aquí porque alguien nos haya querido digitar y no haya podido. Afirmar una cosa así sería lo mismo que decir que mientras estuvimos aquí alguien nos digitó. Y eso jamás ha sido cierto. Sería también un insulto para las personas que van a venir y que se van a quedar, y que seguirán trabajando con verdad y con independencia. Quiero decirles que si bien, nosotros como conductores no elegimos los reportajes y no determinamos su contenido, sí elegimos qué cosa decir en esos reportajes, con qué cara los presentamos, cómo hacemos énfasis en una cosa que en otra. Y eso lo hacemos con total libertad. Cada comentario que dije, cada pregunta que hice, fue finalmente decidida por mí. Y lo mismo, estoy segura, sucedió en el caso de Augusto. ¿Aceptábamos ideas? Claro que aceptábamos ideas, pero éramos independientes. En este canal, en este programa en particular, no hay un ‘prompter’. Algunos lo dicen, pero no hay, no hay ninguna letrita que leamos, no hay un guion. Nadie sabe qué cosa vamos a decir, nadie sabe en este momento lo que voy a decir yo. Y, aun así, esta empresa ha confiado en mí una vez más, y en Augusto, y nos ha permitido hacer esta despedida absolutamente libre. Eso es un gesto que es grande y que valoro muchísimo. Nos vamos. Nuestro contrato ha terminado. No nos han expulsado, simplemente ha terminado nuestro contrato y no estamos en los planes inmediatos del canal. Es decir, no nos renovaron el contrato, pero eso se llama libertad de contratación y eso es un valor que aquí hemos defendido siempre y que voy a seguir defendiendo, aunque hoy día me toque este lado de la mesa porque tengo que agradecer a esta empresa también porque siempre me permitió defender los valores en los que creo. El valor de la libertad, sobre todo; el valor de la equidad, para lograr que las personas tengan mejores y mayores oportunidades, y que un día este país sea más justo. El valor de la verdad, el valor de la transparencia. Y me dio la oportunidad de decir todo lo que creía importante, tratando yo siempre de mantener la educación y la moderación. No quiero olvidarme de todas las cosas que quiero decirles, pero creo que otra cosa importante es que “Cuarto Poder” estuvo antes que nosotros y seguirá después de nosotros. Han sido 15 años impresionantes, una experiencia que valoro muchísimo. No solo “Cuarto Poder”. Yo llegué a América Televisión en el año 1993. Han sido más de 25 años aquí, creciendo delante de las cámaras. Y es la mitad de mi vida casi, un poco menos. Haciendo honor a la verdad, es un poco menos. Creo que lo principal es quedarnos con esto, quedarnos con las gracias. Gracias por todo lo que nos dieron ustedes, gracias por permitirnos darles todo aquello que pudimos dar, gracias por aquello que sí se queda para siempre en nosotros, gracias por lo que tenemos hoy, den gracias ustedes también por lo que tienen. Deseo que, en nuestro país, haya cada vez más paz, que los peruanos nos tratemos con amor y con respeto; que reflexionemos sobre las decisiones que nos toca tomar el próximo año. Es muy importante. Que el 2021 les traiga a todos ustedes lo mejor, que sea un mejor año para nuestro país y creo que eso es todo. Pero permítanme un agradecimiento personal final a mi familia que siempre está conmigo y a mi Ismael. Espero no haberme olvidado de nadie, yo también los voy a extrañar.

LibreOffice is another free of cost alternative to MS Word. The interface offered is very clean and intuitive, and you will have a plethora of features right in front of you. The open-source provides support to .doc and .docx files. However, if it is the cloud base and real-time collaboration that seals the deal for you, then you might not find it truly a good alternative to MS Word. The basic features of MS Word are provided for free, though. You can make flowcharts and draw various diagrams using its Draw feature. Its spreadsheet is also not a tough nut to crack; it is pretty much the same as Excel. It also allows editing PDF documents, something MS Word does not have.

Suspension of the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) is being extended till March 31, 2021, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce virtual conference Monday. “Even the suspension of the IBC has been postponed even further from 25th of December… we've moved to say that it can be up to 31st March 2021,” she said. Sitharaman backed the suspension of IBC for nearly the full year since every industry had gone through major stress because of the pandemic. “So the entire year has had the IBC suspended, and rightly so, because every industry has gone through major stress because of the pandemic and nobody could be drawn the words insolvency which may have occurred during the pandemic,” Sitharaman said at the session with the industry in the preparations to the Union Budget. The government had suspended fresh proceedings under IBC for loan defaults on or after March 25, for six months, as part of measures to provide relief to the industry due to the pandemic. India had announced its first nationwide lockdown on March 25, and relief measures including several compliance relaxations and extensions were announced soon after. The end-date of suspending Sections 7, 9 and 10 of IBC was further extended by three months till December 25. She added that the government through subordinated assistance of banks had hand held industry through the emergency credit liquidity guarantees and partial guarantee scheme, which benefited the micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs). She also sought inputs from industry on the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), big data and automation for MSMEs and the steps that the government should take to help in the transition as companies reset themselves post Covid. “Anything new, anything different, anything out of the box that has to be done, will also have to emanate from people like you who are working in the ground,” she said, noting that the adaptation of technology, automation and benefiting from big data would be necessary for small and medium industries and not just restricted to big industries. Sitharaman pointed out that India should be at the centre of taking advantage of its large pool of soft skills related to AI, robotics and big data management, which can benefit the country’s economic recovery in FY 2021-22. “We should also have our people who are now masters in artificial intelligence for now masters in soft skills related to robotics, or even big data management to help us so that our reset post the COVID benefits from such technology benefits,” she said. During the session, industry suggested top global firms be invited to become anchor investors in priority sectors that can bring innovation and technology practice sectors.

Not having to go through security saves time and a lot of hassle. Screening involves emptying one's pockets into shared-use bins and getting into close proximity with fellow travelers -- even with programs like TSA PreCheck that allow some passengers to leave their shoes and jackets on.
 Taking the train means skipping the security screening and walking right into the station and onto a train without even having to show a ticket in most cases. Amtrak staff doesn't typically don't check tickets until after passengers are on the train and even then, there's often no identification check and the conductor simply scans the ticket without touching it.

Currently, one of the most significant factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements is the adverse effect of COVID-19, including possible resurgences, on the Company’s business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, the real estate market and the hospitality industry specifically, and the global economy and financial markets generally. The significance, extent and duration of the impacts caused by the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, the potential for additional hotel closures/consolidations that may be mandated or advisable, whether based on increased COVID-19 cases or other factors, the slowing or potential rollback of “reopenings” in certain states, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. Moreover, investors are cautioned to interpret many of the risks identified under the section titled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of COVID-19. Such additional factors include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to effectively acquire and dispose of properties; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate pending transactions and implement its operating strategy; changes in general political, economic and competitive conditions and specific market conditions; reduced business and leisure travel due to travel-related health concerns, including the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 or an increase in COVID-19 cases or any other infectious or contagious diseases in the U.S. or abroad; adverse changes in the real estate and real estate capital markets; financing risks; litigation risks; regulatory proceedings or inquiries; and changes in laws or regulations or interpretations of current laws and regulations that impact the Company’s business, assets or classification as a REIT. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore there can be no assurance that such statements included in this press release will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. In addition, the Company’s qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Any forward- looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

Lo scorso 18 dicembre, con l’integrazione dei sistemi cibernetici che completano il robot teleoperativo, in una seduta sperimentale condotta in streaming dall’Istituto italiano di tecnologia insieme al Dit Inail, Ã¨ stato portato a termine il primo triennio di studi sul progetto. Il robot teleoperativo ideato per surrogare la presenza umana diretta in contesti lavorativi ad alto rischio, Ã¨ un apparato complesso ad altissima tecnologia che mette insieme materiali innovativi, sensoristica smart, elettronica miniaturizzata, meccatronica, dispositivi di comunicazione wireless e di visione avanzata per rendere efficace e intuitivo il governo da remoto dell’operatore. La fase finale del progetto ha visto l’assemblaggio strutturato delle tre verticalizzazioni: locomozione, manipolazione, interfaccia aptica e visione immersiva. Il sistema Ã¨ stato reso organico grazie alla progettazione e all’implementazione dei componenti secondo un’architettura funzionale molto efficace. Il movimento Ã¨ affidato a un quadrupede robotico, noto come HyQReal, che con i suoi 90 centimetri di altezza, 133 di lunghezza e 130 chilogrammi di peso, Ã¨ in grado di sviluppare una forza sufficiente a trainare un aereo passeggeri di oltre tre tonnellate, come Ã¨ stato dimostrato in un test effettuato all’aeroporto di Genova lo scorso anno. Le verifiche hanno provato che il quadrupede Ã¨ capace di camminare su terreni accidentati e caratterizzati da grandi pendenze.

Recovery losses momentum even as the US dollar keeps pulling back. XAU/USD flat for the day after a wild ride. Gold prices made sharp fluctuations on Monday to end hovering around $1880, at the same level it closed on Friday. The recovery from the slide to $1855 found resistance at $1885. The yellow metal continues to trade under $1885, finding support above $1870, consolidating even as the US dollar continues to trim gains across the board. Also, equity prices are off lows. The improvement in risk sentiment is not helping gold prices. The DXY peaked above 91.00 and is now approaching 90.00 again. The rally from multi-year lows lost momentum after equity price across the globe bottomed. Fears about a new strain in coronavirus weighed on market sentiment. The agreement in the US for another round of fiscal stimulus contributed to limit losses. From a technical perspective, XAU/USD is moving without a clear bias. Earlier on Monday, gold was rejected from above $1900. The bias still points to the upside, but for the outlook to improve, it needs to rise back above $1890. A consolidation above $1900 would suggest more gains ahead. On the flip side, a decline under $1870 would increase the bearish pressure, exposing the recent low at $1855.
