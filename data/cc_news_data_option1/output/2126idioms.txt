“We definitely had a little luck fall in our hands but being on the podium is being on the podium,” Herrin said. “So there was some very hard fighting with Kyle. Me and him haven’t really got along super well in the past, so it was almost like a Danny Eslick feeling for me. I just saw red. I was so mad. I just wanted to get behind him so bad. I had arm pump for the first time in a long time this weekend, so I just wanted to get in front of him and if I had to slow up the pace I could. That way it could help my arm out a little bit. That actually ended up working out. But seeing those guys fall, seeing Toni (Elias) fall was a bummer. I was like, ‘okay. I at least got a sixth again.’ I saw Scholtz and Bobby fall and I was like, ‘oh, s^%$. This is a podium spot right here.’ Then immediately I starting thinking, ‘man, if Scheibe got a podium…’ And that made me want to push that little bit extra. I’m just happy we could be up here and get some of that BMW contingency, which I really need this year. It’s nice. I don’t know if this is BMW’s first Superbike podium in the States or not, but it just feels good to get it up there. I can definitely say, no disrespect to the team, that I don’t think that bike has the potential right now to be getting on the podium without everybody made mistakes like they did today. Like I said earlier, we got lucky, but we’ve also been doing our work this weekend. I did four practice starts on my bike this morning just to try and get a little bit better launch off the line today. Just stoked to be up here. Congrats to these guys. Definitely didn’t expect this today, so thank you to the Scheibe Racing BMW team and all my sponsors.”

US President Donald Trump loves signing ceremonies, like with his executive order last week to potentially penalize social media platforms such as Twitter.
 Despite the order being wrapped up in a heated US domestic partisan politics debate, could it have the side effect of combating jihad and antisemitic uses of social media?
 First, there is an asterisk to his executive order: Legally, it is probably close to meaningless.
 The reason is that the US Congress already has a decades-old law on the books which gives social media companies exemptions from being sued in relation to the content posted by their users.
 The idea is that they are merely conduits and cannot be held accountable for what their users post. They say this is true both legally, since they are not the ones posting, and practically, because they cannot effectively police abuse of their platforms by billions of users worldwide.
 This exemption has been challenged by numerous groups regarding the use of social media for pornography, antisemitism and even by jihadists (in recent lawsuits by the NGO Shurat Hadin.)
 Each time, the courts have expressed sympathy with the plaintiffs, but noted that the Congressional exemption leaves them powerless to intervene.
 Presidential orders cannot contradict laws passed by Congress - for a law to be passed by Congress it also means a prior president signed it - so his order is symbolic at best. If it reaches the US Supreme Court, it will probably be cancelled.
 But this may not be the end of the story.
 Before that point, a lower court might try to use Trump's executive order to interpret an exception to the Congressional law and try to penalize a social media platform.
 And Trump's order may create momentum for Congress to revisit the issue.
 But any change to the law would require a bipartisan approach, since control of Congress is currently split between Democrats and Republicans, and Democrats will not want to be seen defending Trump's Twitter attacks.
 More likely, the main impact will be that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and others will start to more aggressively self-police their content when it comes to being used by jihadists or antisemites.
 This progression has already happened in Israel.
 Former justice minister Ayelet Shaked was set to push through a law with a range of potential penalties against Facebook and other social media giants, until the platforms cut quiet side deals to self-police.
 This self-policing does not mean that Facebook can prevent a terrorist or antisemite from ever protesting problematic content. However, it does mean that new cyber units in the Shin Bet (Israel Security Service), police and Justice Ministry can quickly flag problematic posts for Facebook, and that in such cases, around 95% of them are removed voluntarily.
 It also means that, as they start combating these phenomena on their own, Facebook and others have invested a large amount of money in finding jihadist accounts or fake accounts used by countries like Iran to spread fake news.
 But many would say that efforts of these platforms in the US lag behind their efforts in Israel or in Europe, where the EU has officially regulated the issue.
 Many of the same problems with Russia trying to use social media platforms to create chaos in the US and influence American elections, as they did in the 2016 presidential election, are still a challenge today.
 Traditionally, the explanation for this disparity is that the right to free speech in the US is relatively stronger than it is in other democracies.
 Facebook and Twitter frequently plead that they do not want to walk down the slippery slope of deciding what kinds of speech are too extreme. But voluntary enforcement is exactly what leaves these platforms vulnerable to Russia, jihadists and antisemites.
 The bottom line is that it will prove difficult to leverage the Trump executive order -  which comes out of his personal fight with Twitter over his attack on mail-in voting - to roll back jihadist and antisemitic use of social media.
 But if the social media giants are moved by societal pressure to voluntarily do even some catching up with Israel and the EU in combating these phenomena, the situation might become better than it is today.

CREMONA, Alta. -- A cacophony of bellowing cattle makes it hard to hear the other hoof drop, but rancher Bruce Bird knows that it's coming.
 Bird runs a cow-calf operation and had to shout to be heard during annual branding last week on his ranch near Cremona, 80 kilometres northwest of Calgary.
 Over a hundred calves were run through a chute and locked onto a table to have ear tags applied and a mark seared onto their sides.
 The COVID-19 pandemic hasn't had a serious effect on Bird yet, but he's anticipating it will be tougher when the calves are sold in the fall.
 "Absolutely, we're going to get hit eventually," he said. "There's usually a big ripple effect prolonged. It's a long, long gradual time until it can rectify itself."
 "There's some marketing issues, some commodity issues … that are really slow to hit us. But when it hits us, it hits us extra hard."
 A concern for Bird and neighbour Chelsey Reid, who farms with her husband, Scott, is a backlog of beef at feedlots.
 The Cargill plant in High River, Alta., shut down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 outbreak there and is now operating at about 60 per cent capacity. The JBS plant in Brooks, Alta., reduced its operations to just one shift a day until recently. The two meat-packers process 70 per cent of Canada's beef.
 "There's always what we call the fall run. That's when there's always a lot of beef on the market, but we always have the capacity for it, so it's not that big of a problem," Reid said.
 "If people aren't able to sell their calves this fall, that's going to be a real problem."
 Reid said the uncertainty is the most unsettling part.
 "Our farms are just sort of carrying on as they always have. Anything that's going to be negative … is going to be happening come this fall and probably in 2021," she said.
 "A lot of us young farmers have a lot of payments that we're tied into, so it definitely is worrisome. It's a lot of money that we definitely rely on."
 Tom Thorlakson said there are animals at his family's feedlot near Airdrie that were supposed to have been shipped to meat plants in mid-April.
 "We have cattle that we wish were gone. We're not buying anything," said Thorlakson, vice-president of Thorlakson Feedyards.
 There are 14,000 cattle at the feedlot and feed costs are running to about $1 million a month, he said.
 "When are we ever going to know when the plants will be up to full capacity? It will be the ever-going threat we're living with right now."
 Thorlakson said he's heard the cattle backlog could exist until December. And although his family feedlot will be OK, it won't be the same for others.
 "It pushes it back to the rancher right? If a lot of the guys are not buying, the guys selling their calves will be getting a lot less money for them because there'll be less demand," he said.
 "There's going to be a lot of guys in hardship."

Unfortunately racism has become the new media “cry wolf” and pushed Covid 19 to the back page.
 The murder of George Floyd was absolutely abhorrent to anyone that saw it. If you haven’t seen it you must be blind because our lying fake media has shown it over, and over and over and over again.
 Just in case you didn’t get that the first four times, the lying fake media has repeatedly shown the murder of George Floyd and then repeated it again, you got that yet?? We will repeat that again later.
 A murder of anyone is reprehensible but showing it repeatedly on TV makes it even worse.
 There are cops in this country that would treat anyone that made them mad the same exact way as those officers in Minneapolis did to George. Thankfully those officers are few and far between and it happens very, very rarely.
 There are over TEN MILLION arrests every single year in this country and that number is down by four million from just a few years ago. There are bound to be two or three a year that are handled horribly by racist, angry or just unhinged cops.
 Doctors kill over 250,000 people a year and they are trying to help.
 The police and all Americans should be careful how others are treated and especially not target any minority just because of the color of their skin.

Military buffs with an eye for value will appreciate the bonus loading affixed to this big-budget war movie. Not only is there a stupendously detailed reconstruction of the 1942 Battle of Midway, that famous four-day skirmish which turned the tide of World War 2 in the Pacific. You also get two more authentic-ish action replays drawn from earlier America-versus-Japan fixtures in the same season of conflict: the brazen attack upon Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo months later. This old-fashioned movie will almost certainly never be mentioned in the same breath as 1917 or Dunkirk. The acting is too wooden, and the storytelling too splintery. However, when it comes to thrilling, chilling spectacle and a desire to put some simple context on a complicated aspect of WW2, Midway holds its own most efficiently. Whether filmed from the perspective of American or Japanese pilots, the vertigo- inducing dive-bombing sequences are almost worth the price of admission in their own right. Stars Woody Harrelson.

It has a proud tradition of training up junior players who progress to the senior league teams and countless members have gone on to represent it’s highest teams.
 Arguably the most talented player to come through has been Paul Edwards, who began with the juniors aged 11 in 1993, after dad Adrian played a match for his club Frys against Uphill, where he met junior club coach Caroline Poole.
 Paul, with brother Mark, was invited to the Saturday junior club training, which started him attending weekly sessions at Westlands sports hall and he was promptly invited to the Avon U12 set-up.
 Edwards rose through the county age groups, including a spell at the Bath futures programme where he played in a selective group of players across the South West counties to receive coaching from former England players Pete and Anthony Bush.
 This was in addition to representing Uphill at U15 and U18 level before moving into the senior club at 15 and he rose through the ranks to make the A team at 17 in 1999.
 This started an unbroken run of 21 years in the club’s highest team, which included three years continued playing while at university in Winchester.
 Edwards has been without question the most successful player in the North Somerset League over the past 15 years with an unrivalled number of wins, playing as number one string for the majority.
 This included three complete unbeaten seasons from 2010-2012 and a run of over 100 wins in a row spread over four years.
 Edwards was a key reason for the club’s record achievement of 12 division one titles in a row from 2004-16 and he has also coached voluntarily with the junior club for 15 years helping a number of young Uphill players progress through the system.
 He has also been the club treasurer for over 10 years, another vital and time consuming job on behalf of the club, and in recent years Edwards has set up a new local badminton club aimed initially at beginners and new players to the sport.
 This venture has taken off in recent years and now boasts multiple nights and venues and local league teams giving playing opportunities to masses of players from the local area.

 But no one intervened Monday evening as 46-year-old Floyd begged for his life while ex-Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin remained kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd's death sparked protests across the country, with thousands echoing some of the man's final words, "I can't breathe."
