Look, the—what we’ve seen with China over many years now—and it’s something I’ve been writing about for well over a decade—is an increasing assertiveness and aggressiveness in the world, and it’s—some of it is very malign. So for example, you talked about the South China Sea. China has basically taken the decision with a Nine-Dash Line or sometimes called the “cow’s tongue” to annex a vast swath of the Western Pacific Ocean and claim it as Chinese territorial waters, almost like it was talking about Lake Tahoe being somewhere close to Beijing as internal waterways or something. It’s ridiculous. It’s been rejected by all major countries, all seafaring countries. It’s been rejected by the Tribunal of the Law of The Sea. And now China’s engaged in military exercises in these waters that are—that they consider domestic, which are by no stretch of the imagination domestic.

An old two-track led us into the woods, but almost immediately we veered left and crashed off into the unknown. Bushwhacking means alternating between watching your feet on the uneven ground, and protecting your eyes as twigs swing back or appear out of nowhere, so when I finally looked up, I was stunned. A bedrock cliff rose straight out of the creek bed we’d just crossed. Where were we?
 The craggy rocks, deep hemlock shade, and lush understory of ferns felt more like my botany field trips in the mountains of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, than plain old Wisconsin. As I admired exposed faces of pink granite, it dawned on me that these rocks are part of a mountain range—albeit a very old and worn-down one. The low hills of Penokee Range stick up higher than most other things in Northern Wisconsin, (but lower than the younger mountains out east,) and also contain some of the highest quality plant communities in our area.
 “Here it is,” came Steve Spickerman’s voice from up ahead. Spickerman is the Forest Ecologist for the Great Divide District of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF), and part of his job is keeping track of how rare plants are doing. I picked my way over moss-covered rocks toward Steve, and found a familiar-looking fern nestled in among boulders near his feet. It wasn’t familiar because I’ve seen it recently, but because I used to see it all the time in Maine and Vermont while I was in graduate school at the University of Vermont.
 While common out east, Braun's holly fern (Polystichum braunii), is a Wisconsin Threatened plant. Its evergreen leaves were shiny and robust, and near the ground the stalks were fringed with big, papery scales in an orangey shade of tan. This fern needs the cool, shady habitat often found on rocky, forested slopes; in ravine bottoms; and at the bases of cliffs. Check, check, and check. Wisconsin’s climate is likely a little on the dry side for holly fern, which may be why it is uncommon here.
 Around the world, this same species is native to Alaska, British Colombia, Newfoundland, Europe, China, and Japan. Braun’s holly fern also occurs within sight of the popular hiking trail at the nearby St. Peter’s Dome recreation area, but hardly anyone pauses long enough to notice. I, for one, am typically focused on spring wildflowers instead of the green backdrop of ferns.
 As we meandered farther down the ravine, the angular rocks went from being the size of basketballs and wagons, to being the size of refrigerators and sofas, sometimes with slopes of smaller talus intermixed. On one of those jumbled slopes, Steve stopped again. This time, the fern at his feet wasn’t robust and evergreen, it was flimsy looking and yellow around the edges. Its fronds were also a little shorter and wider than the typical fern geometry. The leaves will soon wilt into the ground for the winter, and begin from scratch next spring.
 Spreading wood fern (Dryopteris expansa) is another cosmopolitan species. It was first described in Germany, and also grows in Spain, Greece, eastern Asia, and California. According to the Wisconsin DNR, the habitat of this “Special Concern” plant is, “cool coniferous (balsam-fir, white cedar, hemlock) to mixed forests, sometimes in cold canyons.”
 Finding these two ferns—with their surrounding rock fields showing few signs of disturbance—was pretty much all that was needed for the official rare plant survey that was our goal for the day. With some species, like the highly rare and coveted ginseng, the botanists will actually count and mark individual plants so they know for sure when one is gone (vs. just being hard to find). These ferns only require a general check-up every few years.
 “I have the best job on the Forest,” Steve told me as we admired the unique landscape. His field tech, Stephen White, who just earned a permanent position, nodded along in agreement. These guys are a testament to the fact that the Forest Service isn’t just about cutting trees. They also manage landscapes for plants who could never become lumber, and for wildlife who no one hunts. In order to manage well, they do lots of scientific research and monitoring, too.
 Even with rare ferns all around my feet, I couldn’t stop looking up. Sheer cliffs, talus slopes, twisted trees growing out of giant boulder fields…it really didn’t feel like Wisconsin. With such a locally rare habitat type, it’s no surprise that this area—the untracked forest beyond tourist-packed Morgan Falls—has one of the highest concentrations of rare plants on the entire Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.
 The specialness of this area has been on many peoples’ radar for decades. The area around St. Peter’s Dome was recommended for inclusion in the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act of 1975, but a snowmobile trail through the center of it was just too popular. Instead, it’s been designated as a Special Management Area, a Research Natural Area, a State Natural Area, and an Important Bird Area.
 As I scribbled notes about the day in my little field notebook, Steve chimed in. “Please make sure people know that this area is out here for them to enjoy…but there are rare plants, rare snails, and fragile habitats everywhere, so they should be careful to stay on the trail.”
 That’s good advice for many reasons, including the chance that you might get lost in a place that looks nothing like Wisconsin.

"There's a lot of emotions built up with what's going on," Miami's Andre Iguodala said Thursday night from the bubble at Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
 Iguodala, the First Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association — making him the second-highest ranking player in the union behind only Chris Paul — wrote a best-selling book last year, a 256-page memoir of his life and career.
 The saga of this week alone is another story in itself, he said.
 "The last 24 hours would be another 256 pages," Iguodala said Thursday. "It's been very interesting."
 There was the refusal to play by the Milwaukee Bucks, something that caught the league — and even the Bucks' would-be opponent Wednesday, the Orlando Magic — by surprise. That led to two other games being called off, and ultimately a three-hour meeting involving players, coaches and others where some suggested the prudent move would be to end the season.
 By Thursday morning, cooler heads prevailed, and players decided to continue the playoffs. Iguodala said players reminded one another of why they decided to reboot this pandemic-interrupted season in the first place — to use the stage of the NBA playoffs as a platform to urge social change. And walking away now, many said, would do much more harm than good.
 "It's bigger than basketball, but the platform is one of the largest platforms on the entire earth and we've got to continue to leverage that platform," Iguodala said. "The reason why we came down here was continuing to shed light on it. And we didn't want that to be taken away by those who don't want us to see that mission seen all the way through."
 Some players were asked earlier this week if they were concerned that the messaging — "Black Lives Matter" being painted on the courts, many players and coaches kneeling en masse for the national anthems, phrases urging social change and awareness on the back of most uniforms, all of them being steps unprecedented in NBA history — was getting stale, if there was a concern that fans were tuning it out.

No one knows exactly what impact these 24 hours will have in the weeks and months and decades to come, but one thing is certain.
 American sports will forever be divided into two distinct eras.
 What it was before the 26th of August in the year 2020.
 And what it is now.
 After yet another act of violence by police against an unarmed Black man, a crescendo of necessary outrage — "good trouble.," John Lewis would've called it — ignited across our arenas and stadiums on Wednesday.
 The Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court for their NBA playoff game against the Orlando Magic and were willing to forfeit if that's what it came to.
 It was a staggering gesture by a team that has high hopes of winning its first championship in almost a half-century, demonstrating just how much fear and pain and marginalization so many are feeling.
 Even if they happen to be star athletes.
 The Magic refused to accept the forfeit, showing their solidarity with the Bucks. Left with no other alternative, the NBA postponed all three playoff games scheduled for Wednesday at its Disney World bubble, where everyone thought the biggest threat to finishing the season was the coronavirus pandemic.
 Turns out, we should've been paying more attention to the plague of racial injustice, which has stained our nation for all of its 244 years.
 "It's such a terrible situation that we're going through in this country still, after so many years of this," said Kyle Kuzma of the Los Angeles Lakers, whose game against the Portland Trail Blazers was scrapped. "It's kind of depressing."
 Quickly, others were swept up in the moment. The WNBA called off its evening games after the players refused to take the court. Five Major League Soccer games were postponed as well, along with three Major League Baseball games.
 There were more postponements on Thursday, including a remarkable scene in New York where both the Mets and the Miami Marlins took the field, observed a 42-second moment of silence in honor of Jackie Robinson, then walked back to their respective dugouts. All they left behind was a "Black Lives Matter" T-shirt covering home plate.
 For African American athletes, who have played such an enriching role in our country's sporting history, the humiliation of being treated as second-class citizens as soon as they change out of their uniforms has reached a boiling point.
 This wasn't just about Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed after apparently taking four bullets to the back from a police officer's gun, or even those who lost their lives for seemingly no reason other than the color of their skin — George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the thousands who came before them.
 This was also about Thabo Sefolosha, an NBA player whose leg was broken by the police during an arrest. This was about James Blake, a retired professional tennis player who was manhandled by police in a case of mistaken identity.
 This was about every athlete of color who's come to the awful realization that whatever wealth and privilege and adoration they have earned through their playing skills, it doesn't always extend to the police or the justice system or really even to much of their fan base.
 "The most difficult part is to see that people still don't care," said New York Mets outfielder Dominic Smith, who played in his team's game Wednesday but kneeled during the national anthem and was overcome with emotion afterward.

"Captivating" reaches new highs in this spectacular renovated farmhouse-- outside, too. This home is on a one-plus acre lot with sprawling lawns and lush landscaping surrounded by stately trees.
 With its rocking-chair vibe, the introduction to this beauty--a wide farmer's porch with a bead board ceiling--is so appropriately welcoming. A classic paneled front door with a window in a natural finish is the icing on the cake. Until you go inside, that is, where it gets better.
 Gleaming hardwood flooring begins at the entry and is throughout this entire home that has something for everyone. Consider the main floor that has an open, flexible layout that adjusts easily to various uses and/or preferences.
 The living room, for example, that is almost the width of the house, has a gorgeous floor-to-ceiling, stone-front wood-burning fireplace with a hand- hewn-like mantel. This beautiful attention grabber is set against an almost freestanding wall with openings on both sides to the fully open concept eat-in kitchen-dining room.
 Depending on your needs or likes, the "formal" dining room that has its own wood-burning fireplace with a classic mantel, could be an inviting family room. Large enough to seat six to eight comfortably, this nicely proportioned space makes arranging furniture easy.
 The state-of-the-art kitchen, which incidentally is barely 4 years old, has charm and function to spare. The center island that seats three to four has a beautiful butcher block top that exudes country character yet complements contemporary quartz countertops used in the rest of the L-shaped cookery. Stainless steel appliances, a white farmer's ceramic sink and white cabinetry create an overall sophisticated ambiance.
 Oh, pantry cupboards are adjacent to the real thing--a large butler's pantry (complete with a window) and a second dining area maximizes the flexibility of this level. A full bathroom with a corner step-in shower is an added convenience.
 So is the back staircase--of course, this "farmhouse" has one--as well as a side door to the sweetest back porch with granite steps to a spacious paver patio.
 By the way, the backyard of this property, which is a double lot, is flat-out exceptional. An expansive level lawn provides all kinds of play space for young and the young-at-heart. A fire pit is an inevitable gathering spot.
 READY FOR MORE?
 Life on the second floor is well, great. In addition to the master suite, this level has three large, bright bedrooms with excellent closet space. While even the smallest room has a grand-sized walk-in closet, using this as a comfortable home office is an option.
 The shared bathroom, which is also pleasantly large, has a tub/shower combination with a timeless subway tile surround. Sleek tile flooring, however, gives this loo a thoroughly modern look.
 The master suite is an oasis of understated elegance with a king-bed sized sleeping chamber and its gigantic walk-in closet. The retreat-like feeling continues in the en suite bathroom with a step-in shower, a privacy wall for the commode and space for a makeup station. A clean-lined vanity has a vessel sink.
 That the back staircase leads directly to this bedroom makes it feel like a true escape from the madding world.
 Laundry facilities on this floor are another checkmark on the let's-make-life- easy list.
 UPSTAIRS AND DOWN…
 High atop this home--OK it's the third floor but fully finished and fabulous-- is a bonus room or two that runs front-to-back. The entire area that is almost 400 square feet can be used many ways, such as a second family room with an extra sitting room, a giant rainy day play room or a massive office and the list goes on.
 One area has two closets along one wall while the other space is wide open. A cove ceiling adds character; the wall-to-wall carpeting makes everything comfy underfoot.
 Now the even larger lower level, which is the footprint of the house, is filled with wonderful perks. In addition to a huge area ready to be a mini gym, this level has an enormous amount of storage space including two dedicated "rooms" at one end and a 25-foot-long storage "closet." Extra wide open space is flexible to say the least.
 LET'S TALK 'SENSIBLE'
 On the practical side, the number of improvements and the extent of renovations and updates in this home is substantial. Many are also budget friendly to new owners. Consider that the garage roof and the treehouse--yes, there's a treehouse--were done in 2016.
 The following year, new windows were installed, along with new electrical and plumbing and the oil tank was replaced. An electrical hookup for a generator happened in 2018 and the gas line was extended to the garage for heating or for a future pool/spa.

Keeping up the pressure on the United States via small attacks that don’t inflict casualties hasn’t risked escalation that would bring additional US troops to Iraq and has enabled the United States to save face by claiming it is conducting a planned withdrawal. Insofar as this is also a form of deterrence where the United States shows that it is ready and willing to conduct airstrikes if necessary, both sides have achieved a kind of modus vivendi through a correct reading of the others’ intensions. Pro-Iranian groups want the US to leave Iraq and the White House seems bent on withdrawal and to let NATO or other countries pick up the slack. The resulting posture of the US in Iraq looks to be a presence concentrated more in the autonomous Kurdistan region—where US forces have never been targeted by rocket attacks—with a very limited presence in Al-Assad base and Baghdad.
