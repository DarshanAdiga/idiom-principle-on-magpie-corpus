Luke Mulder got the Eagles off to a good start with an inside basket and a three-point bomb to tie the score at five each. A drive shot by Lucas Hol and a rebound put back by Niko Schirz left the Eagles trailing 10-9. Albia went on a 9-0 run with Drew Chance getting into the act with a pair of baskets and Blake adding a three-point bucket to close the first quarter.
 Bennett Spronk got the Eagles off on the right foot to open the second period with a base line drive and a three-point basket. But it seemed that every time the Eagles would make a move, the Blue Demons would have an answer. In this case, it was the Chance boys doing the majority of the damage. Levi Schelhaas and Jaedon Huisman connected from behind the arc for PC, but it was not enough to keep pace with the Albia guns as the Blue Demons took a 36-26 lead into halftime.
 Any hopes of a second half comeback by the Eagles were quickly squelched when Albia found a new gun in their arsenal. Brayden Messamaker erupted for 14 third quarter points and 21 of his 23 points in the second half. That was gut punch for PC.
 But the battling Eagles fought on. Caden Van Dyke converted a four-point play to end the third stanza. He was fouled while making a three-point shot and nailed the free throw to cut the margin to 57-46 going into the final frame.
 The Eagles opened the final eight minutes with a rebound put back by Eric Mulder and a three ball by Schelhaas to cut the Albia lead to six. But the Albia duo of Messamaker and Blake Chance negated any threat that the Eagles could muster. Eric Mulder would have three slams off of rebound put backs in the final six minutes, but it would not be enough.
 “I thought our guys competed hard,” Eagle coach JD Boer said. “Give Albia a ton of credit. They’re a great team and they showed their experience by making big plays when they needed them most. We are a young team with lots of room to grow and get better. This game exposed some of our weaknesses and highlighted some of our strengths. We have plenty to learn from this performance and to correct some of the little things that we can get better at. We have a resilient bench, and I’m looking forward to using this first test as a learning experience for our young team. Every day is an opportunity to get better.”

Polling for seven municipal bodies in Haryana will be held on December 27 and the results will be declared on December 30.
 The poll notification will be issued on December 4 and nomination papers can be filed from December 11 to 16. State election commissioner, Haryana, Dalip Singh, said the general elections for the seats of mayor and members of all wards of MCs of Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat and president and members of municipal council, Rewari; municipal committee, Sampla (Rohtak), Dharuhera (Rewari) and Ukalana (Hisar) will be held on December 27.
 Besides this, bypolls for ward number 7 of municipal committee, Indri (Karnal), ward number 13 of Bhuna (Fatehabad), ward number 12 of Rajaund (Kaithal), ward number 14 of municipal council, Fatehabad and ward number 29 of municipal council, Sirsa have also been notified.
 The election commissioner said the model code of conduct in respect of these municipal bodies has come into force from December 3.
 He said the returning officers would publish a notice for inviting nominations on December 4. The nomination papers will be presented and posted from December 11 to 16 between 11am to 3pm (except December 13).
 Scrutiny of nomination papers will be done on December 17. The last date for withdrawal of candidature is December 18.
 The symbols will be allotted to the contesting candidates on December 18 after 3pm. Polling will be held on December 27 from 8am to 5.30pm.
 The election commissioner said the last one hour (from 4.30 to 5.30 pm) has been fixed for Covid-19 patients and those having Covid-19 symptoms to cast their vote.
 As per him, the post of mayor in the Ambala MC has been reserved for a woman. Besides , the post of president of Sampla municipal committee has been reserved for a woman belonging to Scheduled Castes and the post of president in Rewari municipal council has also been reserved for any candidate belonging to Backward Classes.
 He said the post of mayor in Panchkula and Sonepat MC will remain unreserved and so will be the posts of president in municipal committees of Dharuhera (Rewari) and Ukalana (Hisar).
 He added that the seats of mayor in corporations and president in councils and committees will now be filled up through direct elections.
 Earlier, these seats were being filled up from amongst the elected members of the municipality concerned.

Box noted that while the risk of transmitting COVID-19 at day seven or 10 is low, it is not zero, and the 14-day quarantine may still be the best option for some Hoosiers.
 She added that those with a job that allows them to work just as effectively from home or people who work with vulnerable populations should still complete the full two-week quarantine.
 Southern Indiana health officials say the changes could make a big impact on schools, workplaces and first responding departments if the quarantine can be safely shortened in some cases.
 "I think it's gong to be a bit of a game-changer and for my money, it's long overdue," said Floyd County Health Officer Dr. Tom Harris. "We've known all along that most people that are going to develop symptoms are going to develop it in roughly five days so the 14-day period was a little bit long."
 But for it to work, a person would need to be able to get test results quickly. Harris said the rise in infection and testing has pushed that wait time back a bit lately.
 The tests are much more available now although there's now so much disease and so many people getting tested that the turnaround times are starting to increase," he said. "The stuff we send out, [we're] still looking at a four- or five-day turnaround."
 He said there are also more uses of a rapid antigen test, which has a same-day turnaround, but that is not as widespread as the more traditional test.

The long-awaited _Monster Garage_ revival finally has a premiere date and even a new home. The series, once again hosted by Jesse James, will debut on Jan. 4, exclusively on Discovery's new streaming service, Discovery+. The revival was announced back in February but was delayed in April due to the coronavirus pandemic. The original series ran from 2002 to 2006.
 The _Monster_ _Garage_ revival was filmed at a new West Coast Choppers garage in Austin, Texas. In the 14 years since the last episode aired, James has updated his skill set to create new custom vehicles. "The revamped legendary series will once again focus on transforming regular vehicles into functional machines with a unique purpose while elevating mechanical and automotive vision in the shop," reads a description of the new series. "James is once again looking to accomplish the impossible and will be working with some of the most talented craftsmen and women in the country."
  _Monster Garage_ was originally slated to return this year to mark the 20th anniversary of James' relationship with Discovery. However, James told _In Depth with Graham Bensinger_ in April that the series was put on hold due to the pandemic. At that point, James said only one episode was filmed. "We filmed one episode, but we're on hold now until the 30th of April," the reality TV star said at the time. "Up until people can congregate more than 10 [at a time], because we have a crew of about 30 people behind the scenes, so we can't have them all together. As soon as they give the green light, we've got seven more builds ready to go."
 In each episode of the original _Monster Garage_ , teams were tasked with turning a vehicle into a "monster machine." They only had $5,000 to spend on new parts to change the built and had just seven days to complete the monster. The new series will follow the same premise. If a team does not succeed, James gets to destroy the monster they tried to create.
 Discovery+ will include over 50 exclusive shows, including spinoffs from popular shows from TLC, HGTV, and other Discovery brands. Aside from _Monster Garage_ , the other automotive-themed show will be _Auto Biography_ , a documentary series on surprising stories behind legendary cars and drivers. Both _Monster Garage_ and _Auto Biography_ will be available when Discovery+ launches on Monday, Jan. 4.

Illinois Supreme Court's decision sets legal precedent on this issue
   
 People who plead guilty to crimes are not automatically precluded from later asserting claims of innocence, the state's highest court ruled on Thursday.
   
 The Illinois Supreme Court's unanimous decision creates a new precedent for state courts. This is the first time the high court answered the question of whether individuals who pleaded guilty can still successfully claim innocence.
   
 Under Illinois law, individuals convicted of crimes can petition the court and successfully assert a claim of innocence if they can establish that their rights were violated during the court proceedings that resulted in their conviction.
   
 The court's 22-page opinion holds that the guilty plea of the defendant - in this case, Demario Reed - "does not prevent him from asserting his right to not be deprived of life and liberty given compelling evidence of actual innocence under the (law)."
   
 The court's decision also establishes a new standard that individuals who pleaded guilty and later claim innocence must meet in order for their petition to succeed.
   
 The justices ruled that those individuals can prevail on innocence claims if they can provide "new, material, noncumulative evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a trial would probably result in acquittal," the court's opinion states.
   
 In the case before the court, Reed pleaded guilty in 2015 to armed violence after he was arrested at a Macon County home for possessing crack cocaine and a sawed-off shotgun, which were found in the home. Following his guilty plea, Reed submitted a post-conviction petition asserting his innocence, based on a sworn affidavit from Davie Callaway, who was also at the home when Reed was arrested.
   
 Callaway claimed in the affidavit that the cocaine found in the home belonged to him, and not Reed.
   
 In January 2017, a Macon County judge dismissed Reed's post-conviction petition, finding that Callaway's testimony was not convincing.
   
 Reed appealed to the 4th District Appellate Court, which is one level below the Illinois Supreme Court.
   
 The appellate court agreed with the Macon County judge to dismiss the petition in a 2019 ruling that relied heavily on a 1970 Illinois Supreme Court decision, People v. Cannon.
   
 In the Cannon case, the court rejected the defendant's postconviction claim of actual innocence because, the 1970 Illinois Supreme Court opinion states, "(b)efore his plea of guilty was accepted, the defendant, represented by appointed counsel, was fully and carefully admonished by the trial judge."
   
 The appellate court concluded that it must follow the legal guidance in the Cannon case, "until the supreme court says otherwise."
   
 Illinois Supreme Court justices clarified in Thursday's opinion that the appellate court's reliance on the Cannon case law was misplaced, as the 50-year-old opinion served only as "dicta," or a nonbinding legal opinion, and "does not control this case."
   
 "This court refuses to turn a blind eye to the manifest injustice and failure of our criminal justice system that would result from the continued incarceration of a demonstrably innocent person, even where a defendant pleads guilty," the court's opinion states. "Accordingly, we find defendants who plead guilty may assert an actual innocence claim under the (law)."
   
 While the justices found that Reed was allowed to claim innocence despite his guilty plea, they did not accept Reed's argument that Callaway's affidavit would alter the outcome of a trial.
   
 "We cannot say it was unreasonable for the court to question the truthfulness of Callaway, where he came forward only after being imprisoned and discussing the case with (Reed)," the opinion states.
   
 The Illinois Supreme Court agreed with the appellate court's decision to dismiss Reed's post-conviction petition, although the two courts offered different reasons for the dismissal.
   
 A spokesperson for Illinois Attorney General's Office, which represented the state in this case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Boone's Saloon has closed temporarily while new owners give the popular downtown watering hole a remake.
   
 "There's a lot of potential in Boone's," said Mike Zengilani, who with his partner Chris Stone, purchased the 301 W. Edwards St. business Nov. 23. "We're just tweaking a couple things before the new legislative session gets underway."
   
 The bar and grill -- which is dropping saloon from its name -- will reopen simply as Boone's in late January.
   
 Zengilani -- who worked at Cafe Moxo for the past decade -- said he wants to streamline Boone's menu but will keep all the house favorites, as well as add some of his own touches.
   
 Other expected changes include an expanded outdoor bar and video gaming.
   
 Previous owner Steve Luparell said he agreed to the purchase after Stone and Zengilani approached him with an offer, saying "It was just time to do it so I pulled the trigger." Luparell owned Boone's for the past decade.
   
 The popular bar has been a strong draw since opening on the northwest corner of College and Edwards streets in 1983, especially with the legislative crowd.
   
 The building -- originally home to the Gottschalk's Grocery Store -- is on the National Register of Historic Sites, based on the structure being one of the last remaining neighborhood grocery store buildings left in Springfield.

Two coaches whose resumes do not need to be checked twice will be taking over as the head basketball coaches at Hoosac Valley High School.
 One of them returns to his old stomping grounds.
 After four years away from the program he took to new heights, Bill Robinson is back coaching the Hoosac Valley boys. Robinson led the Hurricanes for 25 years, winning four Western Massachusetts championships and taking his teams to a pair of MIAA state championship games. Robinson takes the helm from interim coach Ben Raimer, who replaced Dave Harte Jr., midway through the 2019-20 season.
 Holly McGovern also returns to a sideline as the new girls coach. McGovern, who replaces Ron Wojcik, has not coached high school basketball before. McGovern is, however, the winningest coach in MCLA women's basketball history. She spent 11 seasons at MCLA, and guided the Trailblazers to the NCAA Division III Tournament in 2010. That's the only NCAA appearance in school history.
 The MCLA basketball program had only one season of .500 or better basketball before McGovern, a former player at Westfield State, took over. In her 11 years, she won 123 games, the most of any coach at the North Adams school in women's basketball history. She had five seasons of over .500 basketball, including a program-best 18-10 record in 2009-10. That year, the Trailblazers beat Worcester State in the MASCAC Tournament championship game, before losing to Final Four-bound Amherst in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
 She will replace Wojcik, who won seven Western Massachusetts championships, one state championship and a state co-championship after the COVID-19 pandemic closed down the 2019-20 winter sports season prematurely. Wojcik and his staff were told in June that they would not be rehired for the coming school year, with the former coach saying "[superintendent Aaron Dean] felt that it was a good time to go in another direction."
 "I love the game of basketball," McGovern said, "and I want to be affiliated in any way I can. I also felt like I could take some of my coaching experience and add it to a program that's had a storied tradition and hope to find some success with the players."
 McGovern understands that she is stepping into some pretty big shoes. But she said she's not feeling any pressure in replacing Wojcik.
 "I don't right now," she said in an interview with The Eagle. "My model is you take things day by day. If you do the right things, success will come. It's one of those models. I always want to drive myself and hopefully the players can follow suit."
 McGovern left the MCLA job when her family relocated to Maryland. But when her husband Joe came back to be the executive director at the Boys & Girls Club of the Berkshires, she started slowly getting back into basketball. The first thing was officiating, and McGovern did a number of boys and girls varsity games last season.
 "To be honest, I've been fortunate — and not just as an official — that's definitely a different way of looking at it. I've been able to do it as a parent and as a coach, and you add in the experience as a player," she said, "and I feel like all those experiences combined into one, make me really fortunate to be able to coach."
 McGovern will have Hoosac graduate McKenzie Robinson, the daughter of the boys coach, as the junior varsity coach. McKenzie Robinson played four years at MCLA, her freshman year under McGovern.
 Bill Robinson is not only a Hoosac Valley graduate, he spent a quarter of a century coaching the Hurricanes into a Western Massachusetts power. He led the Hurricanes to four Western Mass. titles, the last a Division III championship in 2016, which was his final season at the helm.
 "A couple of people approached me and asked me if I would be interested in coming back," he said. "The timing was obviously right. When I stepped away the last time, it was more about my family and watching my girls play. Right now, Kenzie's out of school and Riley is [in college]. It's a good time to come back."
 While Bill Robinson might have stepped away from Hoosac bench, he did not take a step back from the game.
 "I was doing AAU, the girls' program the Berkshire Mountaineers. I was watching plenty of games. I was watching Kenzie play in college and Riley play in high school," he said. "I was still around. I never really lost any focus on the game. I was still attending clinics and stuff. I kept my hand in it.
 "I figured there may be a day where I might come back, so I stayed fresh."
 Back when he stepped down at Hoosac, a story in The Eagle said that Robinson told his staff this could be the last year, adding that he had been pondering stepping aside for a few seasons, "but I've always come back for more. At this point, there is no more."
 The veteran coach said he did not know if there would be games, and if there were games, how many would be played. And if there weren't games, then maybe Robinson and the players would do a fair amount of practicing to install his offensive and defensive systems, and do skills work.
 Now that Robinson has replenished the fuel tank, he was asked if he was surprised the return took only four years.
 "Yeah, but I think everything happens for a reason," he said. "At this point in my life, I'm still kind of young [56]. If it was much later than this, I don't know if I could do it again. I don't know if I'd have the energy to do it."

A return to large dividend distributions for common shares would be an even more favorable outcome. If Golar LNG Partners successfully sorts out refinancing of its 2021 debt and bonds at a reasonable rate, the dividend coverage ratio of 14.5 (higher counting the Hilli income) leaves more than enough room to add back half or more of the $25 million in quarterly distributions shareholders enjoyed in years past. Given the need to thoughtfully manage refinancing in 2021, I would estimate such an increased distribution could be announced in Q2 or Q3 2021. A dividend yield greater than 10% for 2022 does not seem out of the question, if utilization continues to rise and the interest expense from continuing to grow the Golar LNG Partners fleet (through drop downs from the Golar LNG Limited fleet) is limited.
 ## Conclusion
 I have written about LNG shipping stocks before, because I think they often represent some of the most attractive dividend and share price growth plays in the market for the coming decade. Emerging economies in many cases have some of the highest energy prices and some of the greatest unmet need, with FSRU demand expected to grow close to 9% annually over the next 10 years.
 Golar LNG Partners appears to be oversold based on a few quarters of painful cuts and bad news. In reality, should refinancing of debt be successful, Golar LNG Partners will be left with strong cash flows it has enjoyed for many years. I believe earnings will go towards a return to previous dividend yields with some slow debt growth mixed in. For a blended share price and dividend growth play, I think Golar LNG Partners looks like a bargain at current share prices and could offer investors attractive returns over the next two years.

We entered the third quarter with 33 of our California indoor mall stores closed for the entire month of August, began reopening these stores throughout September and reopened the final eight stores on October 7. As we announced in early September, back to school days were meaningfully delayed, compared to prior years, which got us off to a very weak start to the quarter in August. However, as schools announced their later reopening dates, our business began to rebound to a degree later in the quarter. Compared to the respective fiscal months of last year August net sales decreased 35%, but then September net sales increased 22%, and October net sales increased 10%. Altogether this resulted in a total net sales decrease of 9% for the third quarter, which we view as an encouraging result particularly in light of our August results in the significant number of stores that were closed for a portion of the quarter.

New Mexico went into a two-week shutdown on November 16, with an order to shelter-in-place over the Thanksgiving holiday. So when will New Mexicans see the results of those efforts in the COVID-19 data? "Typically it's four to five weeks, so it really literally would be Christmas Day," explained Dr. David Scrase, Secretary for the Human Services Department. "Between Christmas and New Years, and if you're going to see that peak, it's gonna go up."

But really, it’s all they had to work with. The only other Macs are laptops, all-in-one desktops with an unnecessary monitor for cloud data centers, and the giant, overpriced Mac Pro. So this really was AWS’s only option.
 EC2 Mac instances with the Apple M1 custom Arm chip are already in the works, and planned for 2021, according to a blog post by Jeff Barr, chief evangelist for AWS.
 The macOS EC2 instances are accessible over SSH shell or as a VNC remote desktop with up to 32GB of memory for access to AWS services. They are fairly limited in their offerings: you can access Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), AWS Systems Manager, and Amazon Machine Images.
 On the networking side, the instances run in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and include ENA networking with up to 10Gbps of throughput. With EBS-Optimization, and the ability to deliver up to 55,000 IOPS (16KB block size) and 8Gbps of throughput for data transfer, EBS volumes attached to the instances can deliver the performance needed to support I/O-intensive build operations.
 AWS is positioning the instances as a development environment for jobs like “Developing, building, testing, and signing iOS, iPadOS, macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS applications on the Xcode IDE.” So developers can build render farms or CI/CD farms to offload the work from their systems.
 Amazon has not disclosed instance pricing yet, only saying that you can run Mac instances on-demand and you can also purchase a Savings Plan.

DCH Millburn Audi in New Jersey was named the No. 1 dealership on the ninth annual _Automotive News_ list of the 100 Best Dealerships To Work For.
 The top dealership was announced Thursday during a virtual _Automotive News_ event.
 The 100 dealerships were chosen by Best Companies Group, based on surveys submitted by about 25,000 employees of U.S. stores.
 DCH Millburn Audi has long been a standout, earning a spot on the list every year since it debuted in 2012. It climbed to the No. 1 spot after recording a voluntary turnover rate of 19 percent last year, far lower than the industry average.
 Dealership leaders say they value having long-term employees who can build long-lasting relationships with customers. New hires hone their skills by working with veteran colleagues. Some of those veterans have left and then returned.

On Tuesday, Dec. 15, the Scott Soil and Water Conservation District will lead a conservation on best homeowner strategies for winter maintenance.
 Snow is a fact of life in Minnesota and residents have gotten used to managing it with snow blowers, shovels, and road salt, according to a news release from the district. But salt and other deicers are doing more harm than just rusting the bottom of cars, the release said.
 Salt’s two main chemical components are sodium and chloride. Studies show that chloride from road salt in the winter is having negative effects on aquatic life and chloride is considered a permanent pollutant, the release said. This means that there is no feasible way to remove it from water once it has dissolved. One teaspoon of salt contains enough chloride to permanently pollute five gallons of water.

 After the sale of Floyd Memorial Hospital in 2016, the county committed about $40 million to the Floyd County Legacy Foundation and $70 million to the Community Foundation of Southern Indiana. The investments were intended to protect the principal revenue while providing annual spend rates that could be used for community needs.
 Bob Woosley was appointed to the Community Foundation board in 2018, and he informed the Floyd County Commissioners this week that the initial investment had grown to over $74 million at the end of October.

 # Business unemployment taxes go up as jobless claims slow
 Jim Turner
 The News Service of Florida
 TALLAHASSEE — State unemployment taxes are going up for businesses struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic, as the pace of new jobless claims continues to slow in Florida.
 The U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday estimated 20,787 new jobless claims were filed in Florida during the holiday-shortened week that ended Nov. 28. That was an estimated 23% reduction in new claims from the prior week.
 In the Gainesville metropolitan area, unemployment was at 4.3% in October 2020, which is 0.3% higher than in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 6,300 residents filed for unemployment in October.
 And while the federal Government Accountability Office on Monday issued a report questioning the Department of Labor’s reporting methods and data, Thursday’s estimate indicates a continued slowing of new claims in Florida since the start of October, following Gov. Ron DeSantis lifting state COVID-19 business restrictions.
 But the decline in claims won’t alleviate increases in money that Florida employers will have to pay into the state unemployment system, which has been inundated since mid-March as the pandemic damaged the economy.
 While such increases are typically announced by the Florida Department of Revenue, the Florida Chamber of Commerce this week advised members that a minimum unemployment tax rate will increase from 0.10 percent to 0.29 percent as of Jan. 1. A maximum rate will remain at 5.4 percent.
 Information posted on the Florida Chamber’s website said that translates, in part, to employers at the minimum rate seeing a tax rate of $13.30 per employee, from $7 a worker to $20.30. Minimum rate employers are businesses that have not had any layoffs in the prior three years, according to the website.
 Other employers with variable rates will also see increases in 2021 unless they are at the maximum 5.4 percent rate.
 Carolyn Johnson, the Florida Chamber’s director of business, economic development and innovation policy, said Thursday the increases may be moderate compared to hikes businesses incurred after the 2007 to 2009 recession, but they come as employers have navigated effects of the pandemic.
 “While a $13 increase per employee might not make or break somebody having a job, if you have a lot of employees, it can be pretty significant,” Johnson said. “For example, if you're an employer at the minimum rate, and you have 100 employees, you're seeing a $1,300 tax increase in 2021.”
 Johnson said the chamber is forming a working group that will look at unemployment taxes. However, the top unemployment priority for the working group and the chamber heading into the 2021 legislative session will likely remain the state’s troubled CONNECT online unemployment system.
 “We have to have a system that actually works and gets payments out the door in a relatively quick manner,” Johnson said.
 Even with the issues surrounding CONNECT, particularly early in the pandemic as unemployment spiked, the state Department of Economic Opportunity has paid almost $19 billion in unemployment benefits to more than 2.12 million Floridians since March 15.
 Most of the unemployment benefits paid out were covered by the federal government. However, the state’s share has been almost $3.72 billion, depleting the pre-pandemic pool of nearly $4 billion funded through the unemployment tax.
 Florida’s unemployment rate in October was 6.5 percent, with an estimated 659,000 people qualified as unemployed out of a workforce of 10.1 million.
 The surge in unemployment this year will also increase benefits offered by the state.
 With Florida’s third-quarter jobless rate average at 8.6 percent, a formula was triggered that adds seven weeks, from 12 weeks to 19 weeks, in which jobless Floridians in 2021 will be able to draw assistance.
 State law holds the number of weeks at 12 when unemployment is at or below 5 percent, with an additional week added for each 0.5 percentage point above 5 percent in the third quarter of a calendar year.
 The formula doesn’t affect the maximum of $275 in weekly payments the state offers, among the lowest amounts in the nation.
 Thursday’s U.S. Department of Labor estimate came as more than 22,000 layoffs are expected in the coming weeks in the state, with the majority tied to the travel and leisure sectors, predominantly at Walt Disney properties across Central Florida.
 But more than 500 involve hotels and restaurants. And the hotel numbers do not include 45 jobs, from cooks and housekeeping to event management and security, that occurred Monday at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa.
 Another 85 layoffs are tied to transportation and warehousing.
 Canaveral Port Authority informed the state late last month that a round of permanent layoffs, involving 15 employees currently on temporary furlough, will occur Jan. 29.
 “These unprecedented times have been, and remain, difficult,” Amanda Brailsford-Urbina, port vice president of human resources, recreation and customer experience, advised the state.
 The port let 67 employees go on July 29 and had to let a single person go on Oct. 20.
 The Florida Ports Council has estimated the pandemic has caused the loss of about $23 billion in economic activity tied to the 15 seaports in Florida.
 Brailsford-Urbina said in the letter the authority “has taken measures to control and reduce spending throughout this period.”
 The latest round of layoffs at the port authority includes three duty harbormasters, a manager of cargo container operations, a supervisor of cruise operations and the director of public safety.

Polling for seven municipal bodies in Haryana will be held on December 27 and the results will be declared on December 30.
 The poll notification will be issued on December 4 and nomination papers can be filed from December 11 to 16. State election commissioner, Haryana, Dalip Singh, said the general elections for the seats of mayor and members of all wards of MCs of Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat and president and members of municipal council, Rewari; municipal committee, Sampla (Rohtak), Dharuhera (Rewari) and Ukalana (Hisar) will be held on December 27.
 Besides this, bypolls for ward number 7 of municipal committee, Indri (Karnal), ward number 13 of Bhuna (Fatehabad), ward number 12 of Rajaund (Kaithal), ward number 14 of municipal council, Fatehabad and ward number 29 of municipal council, Sirsa have also been notified.
 The election commissioner said the model code of conduct in respect of these municipal bodies has come into force from December 3.
   
   
 He said the returning officers would publish a notice for inviting nominations on December 4. The nomination papers will be presented and posted from December 11 to 16 between 11am to 3pm (except December 13).
 Scrutiny of nomination papers will be done on December 17. The last date for withdrawal of candidature is December 18.
 The symbols will be allotted to the contesting candidates on December 18 after 3pm. Polling will be held on December 27 from 8am to 5.30pm.
 The election commissioner said the last one hour (from 4.30 to 5.30 pm) has been fixed for Covid-19 patients and those having Covid-19 symptoms to cast their vote.
 As per him, the post of mayor in the Ambala MC has been reserved for a woman. Besides , the post of president of Sampla municipal committee has been reserved for a woman belonging to Scheduled Castes and the post of president in Rewari municipal council has also been reserved for any candidate belonging to Backward Classes.
 He said the post of mayor in Panchkula and Sonepat MC will remain unreserved and so will be the posts of president in municipal committees of Dharuhera (Rewari) and Ukalana (Hisar).
 He added that the seats of mayor in corporations and president in councils and committees will now be filled up through direct elections.
 Earlier, these seats were being filled up from amongst the elected members of the municipality concerned. However, the seats of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor of the corporations and vice-president of the councils and committees will be filled up as per previous practice that is through indirect election from amongst the elected members of the municipality concerned.
 Congress to contest municipal polls on symbol
 Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja on Thursday said her party will contest the upcoming municipal polls on the party symbol.
 In a statement, Selja said decision to contest municipal polls on party symbol was taken after holding consultations with AICC incharge for Haryana, Vivek Bansal, and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda.
