"IPL's also a terrific tournament as a domestic tournament. So that''s out of everyone's control at the moment, players are just doing what we're told and going where we need to go and playing whatever's on at that stage," he added.
 Smith also said that the news regarding T20 World Cup will be out in the public domain soon and added that he would just be following the guidelines issued by the government and health officials.
 "I guess there'll be some more news about it soon, probably some decisions to be made soon, so I'm sure we'll all find out and know where we're going to be. I personally haven't really thought about it, I think it'd just be going off the advice of the professionals and the governments and essentially doing what we're told," Smith said.
 "If that happens then great, if not then there's just so much going on in the world right now that cricket kind of seems a little bit irrelevant. So we'll get back when we're told to and until then it is sit tight, get fit and strong and freshen up mentally," he added.
 The 30-year-old Smith is currently the number one ranked ICC Test batsman with 911 points and is closely followed by India skipper Virat Kohli with 886 points.
 Smith was last seen in action against New Zealand in the first ODI of the three-match series in March this year.
 After the first ODI, the series between both sides was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Smith would have been leading the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL if the tournament had started on March 29.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our communities, livelihoods and economies for weeks -- and the costs have been high. From losses of life from coronavirus to losses of jobs and major hits to the economy, nearly every aspect of life has evolved in response.
   
 The virus prompted schools to close and students ended their school year through online distance learning, as employees in many job sectors have or continue to work from home, while many others have lost their jobs entirely, especially in certain businesses most impacted by shutdowns.
   
 Everything about daily life, from how we shop for groceries and dine out, or even attend church services or gatherings such as weddings and funerals, has changed. The cancellation of sports, local events and festivals and just about every other form of entertainment halted social lives. Despite the pandemic, fears and many unknowns, coronavirus has brought the community closer together to help others in many ways -- even while we've been socially kept apart.
   
 Whether in print or online, we've covered the coronavirus and responses as individuals, businesses, organizations and others have evolved and adapted to offer help, support and much more through these truly historic times. Modern technologies have allowed church services, education, work and even family get-togethers to continue while maintaining safe social distancing.
   
 But as America begins to slowly reopen and rebuild its economy, we all face many questions on what life will be like moving forward.
   
 Today's special "Rebuilding America" edition is a combined effort involving more than 200 Gannett newspapers in the USA Today network, including Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise, as our communities work to rebuild lives, reopen businesses and restart the economy.
   
 Our coverage explores many areas of American life and what it looks like for our communities in a coronavirus world. Topics from healthcare to home services, restaurants and dining out, retail and local businesses, sports, education and entertainment, to travel, financial services and even real estate are included.
   
 All of our communities have been impacted, but as we look forward, we are all united. We're united in supporting our local businesses and united in ensuring the health and safety of our communities.
   
 We may face an uncertain road ahead, but what we do have is each other.
   
 Many have said "We're all in this together," and that thinking -- and resilience -- will carry us through the days and weeks ahead.

Interest-free loan to the tune of ₹210 crore will be disbursed to paddy farmers in the district for the kuruvai season, Director of Agriculture V. Dakshinamoorthy said on Monday.
 The loans will be disbursed through the 122 primary agricultural cooperative credit societies in the district, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy said, while on an inspection to the district to monitor the progress of on-going works in the water bodies ahead of the release of water from Mettur Dam, which has been planned on June 12.
 The department anticipates that paddy crop will be raised in an additional 27,500 acres, over and above the usual 1.02 lakh acres in the district. So far, cultivation has been started in 40,063 acres, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy said.
 To ensure better yield, 582 metric tonnes of certified seeds of Aduthurai 36, 37, 43, 45 and 53, DKM 9, Ko 1, Ambai 16, and TPS 5 varieties will be made available through agricultural extension centres and private seed outlets.So far, 719 metric tonnes of certified seeds have been distributed, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy said, urging farmers to avail themselves of the utility of the 50 percent subsidy provided under Seed Village Scheme.
 Likewise, 6,423 metric tonnes of urea, DAP, potash, complex and phosphate have been stocked in the primary agricultural cooperative credit societies and private outlets. Monthly distribution system will followed during June-July, he said, adding that there was adequacy of micronutrients, and bio manure.
 There will be uninterrupted supply of three-phase power for 12 hours for the agricultural fields in the delta districts, he said.
 Ten percent of the desilting works undertaken by the Public Works Departemnt in 'A' and 'B' canals to a length of 1,072 km have been completed. The works are expected to be completed before release of water in the river, he said.
 As for the 'C' and 'D' canals, the desilting works have been carried out to a length of 3,160 km. Last year, the work was completed in such canals to a length of 1,400 km.
 Accompanied by District Collector Praveen P. Nair and other senior officials, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy inspected a demonstration of mechanised planting in a 55-acre paddy field at Manganallur village in Kuttalam block.
 At Sembanarkovil, he handed over four power tillers to farmers belonging to Thiruchampalli Farmer Producer Company under Kootu Pannai Thittam.

He wasn’t kidding. Charles McNeil was in his 30s, a pole-thin, six-foot, football-obsessed mathematical genius with a degree from the University of Chicago. He had been gambling most of his life, parlaying a gift for numbers, a confidence in himself and an obsession with sports, into a side hustle.
 No moment was too small to calculate. Little numbers led to big numbers that more than supplemented his meager salary as a Depression-era securities analyst.
 At least until he lost his job. Not because the bank went under or he fleeced a client. He had been setting odds on the next person the bank would fire and put the president of the company as the favorite at 3-1. Further down the list he put himself, at 8-1.
 The boss found out. He didn’t like the odds, or the game. And soon McNeil found himself unemployed, spending his days at Wrigley Field, betting on disappointing Cubs teams and fall-down drunks.
 And in that flash of a moment, instead of finding a new job at a flailing bank, he created an instrument that changed the future of sports forever. He called it “wholesaling odds.”
 The rest of us know it as the point spread.
 If you’re new here, the point spread is what bookmakers use to, essentially, level the game, making it easier for bettors to place their wagers. Before McNeil made his invention public in the 1940s, bets were placed on what they called moneyline odds. The Bears would be -350 favorites against the Packers, for example. That meant, if you wanted to win $100 on the Bears, you had to bet $350 on the moneyline. That’s a pretty hefty tax.
 And, unless you grew up reading Damon Runyan novels, that kind of math was, and still is, a barrier to entry for a lot of people.
 McNeil evened things out. In his system, the Bears could be seven-point favorites over the Packers, and all you had to know was that, if the Bears won by more than seven points, you won your bet. No math; just fandom.
 Given how long betting has been around — Egyptian tombs dating back to 3500 BC have been found that depict noblemen playing a crude game of dice — it’s easy to forget, if you ever knew at all, what a relatively modern invention the point spread really is.
 But, over the past 80 years or so, since McNeil first posted the spread, it’s become the fulcrum upon which an entire industry has pivoted. And, I’m not just talking about betting.
 The modern era of sports is inherently tied to wagering. I don’t mean black- and-white tinged, point-shaving scandal memories. I mean the technicolor version: cheerleaders, ratings, marketing spends, massive affiliate fees, bonzo media deals, stadiums packed to the clouds, flyovers, March Sadness memes, broadcasters making $17M a year. The six-inches-in-front-of-your-face version of sports we desperately miss right now.

For those working on fishing boats trawling the seabed in search of the prawns — 12 hours at sea can yield just a dozen kilograms or so — the only consolation has been that oil prices have also collapsed during the pandemic, allowing them to use their boats without spending so much on gas.
 “The question is whether people will return in large numbers to the restaurants before the oil prices rise again,” said Josep Garriga, 71, who has officially retired but who still enjoys prawn fishing alongside his son, Jaume, who has taken over the captaincy of their family boat. “Everything has become like the day-to-day uncertainty of fishing, where you always hope for a good catch but never start with anything guaranteed.”
 For years, Garriga and a few other local fishers supplied Paco Pérez, a chef whose two-star Michelin restaurant is within walking distance of the port. The lockdown forced Pérez to close up and spend more time inside his adjoining family home. Three Latin American trainees, who arrived for cooking apprenticeships shortly before the beginning of the state of emergency, have also been marooned on his property.
