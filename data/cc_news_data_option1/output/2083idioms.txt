I was also extremely wary of the conventions that guide most films about disaster. When I began making _Landfall_ immediately after María hit Puerto Rico, I already felt tired of the media images that were circulating like clockwork: people stranded on roofs as streets flood, flattened houses and crops, people waiting in epically long lines for gas or food. This is the visual parade of horrors we are conditioned to expect from disasters. It’s akin to ruin porn, a way of looking driven by a voyeuristic pleasure in gazing at the suffering of others. These images perpetuate a victim narrative that situates Puerto Ricans as a passive, disempowered people, and they don’t square with the Puerto Rico I know. _Landfall_ refuses all that, in search of a more animated afterimage. Yes, post-María Puerto Rico is in many ways a ruined world, but its people are not.

Hello manicm – no doubt it would ride more sweetly on the standard suspension, at least at lower speeds, but I'd be amazed if the difference was night and day, simply because the car is now so unbelievably fast and also heavy enough that it needs very firm suspension to be both safe and effective.

According to the petition, in March, the Oklahoma State Regents and state universities announced transitions to online formats, and students who lived on university campuses were either forced or encouraged to move out of their housing. The universities also halted most on-campus services that families involved in the lawsuit paid for.
 “For all practical purposes, students had to leave campus, sacrificing the fees they paid to be on campus and for the services that come with being on campus,” the petition read. “Even for those students who had no choice but to remain on campus, campus services were essentially shut down and they could not receive the benefit for which their fees for the semester paid.”
 According to the petition, the state regents have refused to refund students and families the unused portions of the fees they paid. The petition read that higher education institutions in other states have recognized the upheaval and financial harm that the transition to online classes has caused many families, and they have awarded appropriate refunds.
 "These institutions recognize that because they are unable to provide the full slate of services for which the students paid, the institutions have no legal or ethical basis to retain the students’ money,” the petition read. “Oklahoma Regents, unfortunately, has refused to refund any fees other than room and board. The refunds have been inconsistent and incomplete.”
 OU Director of Media Relations Kesha Keith said in a university statement that “it’s not the practice of the University to comment on pending litigation, particularly in cases … that do not list OU as a party. In general, throughout the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis, OU has prioritized the safety of its students and campus community, and has recognized the disruptive impact the virus has had on our students and their families. This is why OU acted quickly to issue refunds for housing, food and parking, and provided individualized financial assistance to students.”
 OU administrators announced March 20 they’d be offering some housing and food refunds. Partial parking pass refunds for students were announced on March 24. University administration has also encouraged students to turn to programs like Sooners Helping Sooners for financial support.
 Thetford said his team’s lawsuit has gotten a lot of attention from university students’ families.
 “We’ve had dozens — if not hundreds — of families and individuals that are interested in this lawsuit … and believe that these fees need to be returned to the students because, at the end of the day, these fees were pre-paid for, and they’re supposed to receive something,” Thetford said.

 It's hard to believe, but I'm officially not a freshman senator anymore. What an interesting time to be in the Legislature and have a front row seat to history in the making. Unfortunately, it's been sad history the last couple of months, but I'm so proud of our state employees, especially in the Senate.
 I want to thank our Senate Leadership and staff for their hard work in getting us through the COVID-19 pandemic. I, especially, want to thank my Executive Assistant, Cindy Stevens, who has been helping and continues to help so many with their unemployment issues and other problems they're dealing with during this worldwide crisis.
 Senators and staff alike teleworked around the clock to ensure the people's business continued to get done. This was an extremely stressful and emotional time for many, dealing with the changes to their family life and worrying about protecting their families but then having to put all of that aside to confront this crisis head-on to help the people of Oklahoma. It was not easy, and I applaud our state employees for their dedication and resilience.
 For the most part, our state government system was not set up for telework and to address a health crisis of this magnitude. But this historic crisis has now forced our state agencies to provide more digital services and forced employees to work from home. I've said it before, but we will come out of this stronger than ever.
 The Legislature realized the benefits of putting additional funds into the state's emergency savings accounts last year, which made a tremendous difference in filling the current year's revenue shortfall and next year's $1 billion shortfall. Families have also realized the importance of heeding the advice of having 3-6 months of savings in the bank. We must all save for emergencies.
 Our state agencies faced historic demands for their services, which has made them change how they do business. Websites and computer systems have been upgraded more than ever, and because of social distancing services are being offered digitally. Our state government is seeing where we need to improve overall services and trying to create more reliable revenue sources to protect state agencies and taxpayers. It's been a learning experience for all of us.
 Because our time was cut short, we had to only focus on those bills that were absolutely necessary to renew programs, committees or other aspects but also to address the critical needs of our state during this historic crisis and ensure our state government can continue providing services in the coming year.
 I had seven Senate bills and 11 House bills that I'm the Senate author for that will have to be revisited next session.
 The governor will have signed more than 150 bills into law by the end of the week. There's a good chance we'll be called back into session to override his vetoes of various bills. Once we do that, our work for the 2020 session will officially be done and we can Sine Die adjourn.
 Please sign up for updates on our Senate website (www.oksenate.gov), follow our official Facebook page at Oklahoma State Senate or follow us on Twitter @OKSENATEINFO to stay up on what's happening.
 It's been a fast and furious year and I'm looking forward to a short break to relax and then I'll be back at it. With the continuing crisis, we're already looking at what steps may need to be taken next session to further help the citizens of Oklahoma and modernize state services.
 If you haven't already, please fill out your U.S. Census form. Our state desperately needs the federal funds determined by the census population count. Every Oklahoman not counted, including infants and other children, will lose the state an estimated $17,000 in federal funds over the next decade. You can fill yours out at www.2020Census.gov; call 1-844-330-2020 or fill out the paper form mailed to your house.
 Thank you again for letting me be your voice in the legislative process. If I can be of any assistance, please contact me by calling (405) 521-5581 or emailing Bill.Coleman@oksenate.gov.

Generally, there are two scenarios in the problem of top item discovery. In one scenario, the number of target top items is unknown and unidentifiable, meanwhile the qualities of top items are more important than the bottom ones, i.e., the errors in top items incur larger losses. In this circumstance, the problem of identifying top items is essentially a top-heavy ranking problem. In another scenario, the number of target top items can be predefined or known. The problem is equivalent to a top-K selection problem in this circumstance. In this dissertation, we propose novel algorithms for problems of both scenarios.

 Kiddie Park manager overcomes COVID-19, still to open park
   
 Kiddie Park opens this summer with tickets still 50 cents and the last train ride is free adding some normalcy to the chaotic world around us.
   
 The man, who has been behind the scenes at Kiddie Park since about the age of 14, not only suffered from COVID-19 but he is making sure his park is open for children and their families.
   
 David Lea, manager, caught COVID-19 while recuperating from hernia surgery at Ascension St. John Jane Phillips Medical Center, and is making sure all precautions are taken to keep children safe at Kiddie Park this year.
   
 Scheduled for a later start date, June 2, volunteers were working on the park while a member of Emergency Management was spraying and disinfecting rides.
   
 Kiddie Park will be open Tuesday thru Thursday 7 pm to 9:30 pm; Friday and Saturday 7 pm to 10 p.m. closed Sundays and Mondays.
   
 Lea returned to the hospital following the hernia surgery for treatment of pockets of infection. He was tested April 1 after he was suffering from body aches and fever.
   
 "The test alone was barbaric. I don't ever want to do that again," he said.
   
 "One day I was packed in ice because my temperature was so high. It was something else. I had such a hard time breathing and they put me on oxygen," he said.
   
 Five days were spent in the hospital and 14 days at home were spent in quarantine.
   
 "I still feel a little winded if I do a lot but I feel a lot better than I did," he said.

 According to court documents, Jamin Charles Mattocks, 36, was arrested on a complaint of lewd molestation to a child under 16.
   
 It was reported to the Department of Human Services that Mattocks had admitted to molesting an 8-year-old and a 6-year-old.
   
 The defendant reportedly admitted he was watching pornography and did not turn it off when a child was around because he was horny and "did not care to turn it off", documents state.

 Senate Bill 1718
   
 New law will require mental health parity in health insurance
   
 By Carmen Forman
   
 The Oklahoman
   
 Health insurance companies will be required to cover mental health and substance use disorders the same way they cover physical ailments under a new state law.
   
 Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed legislation to require companies that offer health coverage and are regulated by the state insurance department to follow federal laws on parity in the health care industry.
   
 Senate Bill 1718 tasks Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready with ensuring all in-state health plans comply with a 2008 federal law signed by President George W. Bush that calls for financial parity.
   
 Despite federal requirements, many states, and the country as a whole, still struggle to provide equal coverage for mental health and substance use treatment. This inequality can come in the form of fewer in-network physicians or unequal reimbursement rates for behavioral health compared to physical health.
   
 Insurance companies that offer mental health or substance use disorder plans also would have to report annually to the Insurance Commissioner the process by which they determine the criteria for mental health benefits and the criteria for medical and surgical benefits.
   
 The department would be required to make the reports public by June 1, 2021, and every June thereafter.
   
 This law will take effect Nov. 1.

The submersion of East Asian markets into coronavirus-induced recession has pulled down several major oil producers, most notably Nigeria whose breakeven price is well above $100 per barrel Fitch puts it at $144 per barrel. Depending on its crude production for 60% of government revenue, Nigeria was confronted with a double whammy of falling oil prices and general economic decline - to the extent that Lagos has applied for some 7 billion in SARS-COV-2-related emergency funds provided by the IMF and the World Bank. Nigeria's credit ratings were downgraded by both S&P and Fitch Moody's kept the negative outlook without downgrading and things seemed as if the most populous country in Africa might be in for some serious trouble. Part of the anxiety was due to the fact that Nigeria agreed to participate in the unprecedented Russia-Saudi Arabia-United States crude production curtailment and vowed to drop output levels by some 300kbpd to an overall level of 1.4mbpd do not be confused by the ostensibly higher level of crude exports, Nigerian condensates are out of the question and will remain left out from the deal itself. The Nigerian Oil Ministry even went as far as to say that they expect 2.8 billion in additional revenue from being part of the OPEC deal. Initially, however, whilst Nigeria's commitment to the deal entirely laudable, it seemed as if OPEC was removing only a fraction of barrels that entered the market. Graph 1. Nigeria's Crude Exports in 2017-2020 in million barrels per day. Source Thomson Reuters. Now Nigeria can finally let off a brief sigh of relief as the return of China has boosted both export prospects and grade differentials. Led by Saudi Arabia, leading Middle Eastern producers engaged in a hypercompetitive price war and despite most of West African crudes remaining one of the most optimal sources for IMO 2020-compliant products, Nigerian crudes struggled to reach their traditional market outlets in Asia. The intense price pressure has rendered West African remarkably attractive after it drove them to multi-year lows - even IMO 2020 favorites like the Equitorial-Guinean Zafiro or Chadian Doba went as low as -7 against Dated Brent, not to speak of the manifold light sweet grades West Africa wields. Chinese buyers would generally buy only 1-2 cargoes from Nigeria yet boosted by the economic profitability of West African countries in April there were 4 vessels sailing off for China and the May 2020 tally went even further to a whopping 7 cargoes, totaling 9 MMbbls. Interestingly, both April and May witnessed an Egina cargo loading for China, despite it being a staple diet of Northwest European refiners. This reconfiguration of the usual state of things albeit temporary is partially due to the fact that Indian demand, routinely the largest magnet for Nigerian grades, has subsided somewhat as the SARS- COV-2-induced lockdown took place there with a delay of several months. All this means that Nigerian cargoes arriving to China this June will mark the highest-ever level, whilst West African exports to China will be the highest since November 2018. Related Will There Be Another Oil Price War As impressive as the Nigerian export surge to China seems, it would not have happened without extremely depressed grade differentials. The combination of Middle Eastern producers cutting OSPs and the coronavirus demand slump has elicited an unprecedented drop in Nigerian differentials - from March to April the OSPs are usually published around the 15th of the preceding months almost every single grade has witnessed a $4-5 per barrel month-on-month decline. Moreover, differentials were plummeting even harder in terms of real market prices since OSPs play a largely indicative role - after most flagship Nigerian grades moved to discounts against Dated Brent in March, it took them more than a month to bottom out in the $-7\/-9 per barrel interval to Dated.

The official selling prices of Nigerian grades present a fairly truthful picture of their current pricing levels. If the OSPs of light sweet, predominantly IMO 2020-compliant, Nigerian grades drop in May 2020 to $-3 or even $-4 per barrel against Dated Brent, the lowest ever recorded, then surely something is not right. Yet as the June OSPs start to transpire one can see that a bounce back of differentials is already taking place, Nigeria's flagship export streams like Bonny Light or Qua Iboe are both assessed at $-1.05 per barrel to Dated, with the rest moving even stronger towards a flat Brent assessment. As Europe comes back from a multi-month lockdown season, it will rediscover its appetite for West African crudes, hence the probability of the Nigerian export surge to China becoming a long-term trend especially with the strengthening diffs is shrinking.

Nigeria's way forward will not be easy - its exports possibilities will be subdued for a couple of months by its participation in OPEC, all its differentials will not go back to pre-corona territory that easily. This will be especially true of high- gasoline-yield very light grades, whilst grades with a more balanced mid- distillate yield should become the best performers of this summer. Nigerian exporters would also need to keep in mind the risk of increased competition - to name just one example, the Indian refiner IOC has awarded in a recent purchase tender in May to the American WTI although almost everyone expected it to buy Nigerian.

My choices are either Comcast or my current provider, CenturyLink. With CenturyLink I can stream at a speed which drops to a whole 140p on youtube between 6pm and 1am or so despite having a 12 megabit DSL. This goes for a PC or Roku; on Sling or Youtube. I can download files (and videos), and get the right scores on internet speed tests; just not effectively stream. The only reason I'm still using CenturyLink is because of how much I despise Comcast/Xfininity. My municipality rejected the available state wide community fiber and opted to keep the "duopoly" where we pay through the nose for a substandard product.

Yes, I think as we moved so -- and this was later in the quarter as well, but I think just given the environment and maybe some of the risks out there for the year, we just thought it prudent to get ahead of the game a little bit on some of that use. So we did push more out there. And it's hard to, I think overall, I think we were up like 25% I think our used was up similar amount, maybe even a little higher than that for the quarter to help give you the magnitude of that.

“Even a strong tropical storm can cause heartache all along the coastline in Ruskin, Apollo Beach and Gibsonton and anywhere along our rivers in South Shore,” he said. “Storm surge is our biggest threat, but many times flooding rain kills more people than anything else. Wherever water flows, homes can [be] washed off their foundations; wherever the [water] piles up, we see massive flooding.”

Cook: The one real benefit to communicating virtually is removing some barriers to entry. And not only in reducing expenses for filmmakers with travel, accommodations, etc. But that it gives greater accessibility across the board -- for filmmakers who may live somewhere without access to festivals and markets, or aren’t able to attend both physically and/or economically.

"Sometimes I hear people say, ‘What are you complaining about? Slavery was abolished 150 years ago.' They're missing the point. We haven't come to grips with it. If we had, we wouldn't still see Confederate flags flying around, whether it's at courthouses or at Trump rallies. I know some of those have been taken down over the past few years, but I feel there's never truly been reconciliation with the sins of our past."

Moore: We’re adjusting plans on a weekly basis. Mostly we’re sticking to our guns on what we want to make in the next year or two, but every production has to ask of itself whether the current situation needs to be reflected in the film. For some films it doesn’t. For some the entire premise needs to be revisited. And at the end of the day it’s pretty straightforward -- we’re documenting the world and the world has changed a little. So we adjust.
