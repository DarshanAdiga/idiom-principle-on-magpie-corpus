Although the coronavirus pandemic has most people limiting their travel, Patrick Henry Community College students Wylie Martin and Marco Diaz are nowhere close to home, having netted an opportunity of a lifetime to be more than 1,000 miles away swimming with sharks.
 Martin and Diaz didn’t book their adventure through a travel site, and their trek to the Bahamas isn’t an ordinary vacation. Rather, this is a research expedition that includes not only being in the ocean with sharks but also cleaning beaches and conducting field research with marine scientists and professors from across the country.
 Last year, while watching Discovery Channel’s iconic annual “Shark Week” – a week of TV programming dedicated to sharks – PHCC biology professor Jason Worley heard about a nonprofit organization called Saving the Blue, which, according to the organization’s website, aims “to inspire, influence and coach a generation of ocean advocates through hands-on, in-field research activities.”

Suddenly walking was looking like a safer alternative to riding a bike – until summer got here. By then, he was dying to get back in the saddle, but he still needed a sense of purpose to climb back on. So he invented one, mapping out a plan to ride his bike the length of every street in the city – even the dead ends.
 “I'm goal-oriented,” he says. “So if I have a goal I'm inspired to work with it and that works for me.”
 From Avenue A to Yolande Street, the 63-year-old Summer Street resident finished the trek on July 11. A meticulous record-keeper, Linder clocked about 265 miles in all. He didn't count the streets, but there are over 550 of them in the city, and Linder says he pedaled down every one.
 It took him about 29 hours over 16 non-consecutive days of riding to complete the tour.
 He learned a lot about the city from riding every linear inch of its pavement on a bicycle, says Linder, a New York native who moved here from Queens about four years ago to live closer to his fiancee's family.
 One of the most memorable lessons?
 “It's a very hilly city,” Linder deadpans. “It seems like every dead end is up a huge hill, so I'm climbing these hills for nothing.”
 Also, Linder says he discovered roads disguised as driveways, roads that don't exist and at least one road, Hill Street, that shouldn't be a road at all. It's hard to believe anyone uses it, even with a motor vehicle, because it's pretty much unnavigable.
 As for the roads that don't exist, he has no idea where they went, but Google says they're supposed to be there – and they aren't. It's sort of annoying riding a bicycle toward a road you assumed was there, but isn't, because sometimes it means adding a few extra blocks to your itinerary to find your way back to the route.
 From his vantage point atop a bicycle, the city was a blur of diverse neighborhoods, “some with a lot of nice houses and some with not-so-nice houses,” says Linder. He remembers being struck by one parcel with a car in the yard that was completely engulfed in vines of ivy. It wasn't offensive, says Linder, but it was part of a broader feature of the city that he had never fully appreciated before – an abundance of natural beauty.
 “There's a lot of forest, or woods, throughout the city,” said Linder. “I grew up in New York City and I lived in San Jose. They have parks. Here, just riding through the neighborhood and all of a sudden, just woods. Very interesting.”
 Another thing he discovered?
 “Nobody prints maps anymore,” says Linder.
 He wanted one so he could red-line every street he pedaled through just to make sure it was accounted for and checked off his list. He improvised. He took screenshots of the grid on Google Maps. It took 16 of them to compile into one map of the city that he could blow up for a full-screen image, which became
 his bicycling log.
 Except for some sand at various intersections that posed a potential hazard for a bicyclist, Linder gives the condition of the roads in the city good grades.
 “There is one street, Hill Street, I actually couldn't believe it was a street,” said Linder. In general, however, “I was very happy. The roads are actually decent.”

MANSFIELD - This is the first in a four-part series on athletic fields of Mansfield.
 The Branch Street grounds was one of the earliest athletic fields in town. It was located off Branch Street where we would today find Eddy Street. For about 20 years it was Mansfield's main athletic field.
 The grounds first came into use in the late 1880s. It featured a baseball diamond that faced toward Branch Street. In centerfield was a "towering" pine tree where fans could find shade. If a batter hit the pine it was an automatic double.
 Club baseball began on the Branch Street grounds in the late 1880s. These were local teams comprised of players generally in their late teens or 20s. They charged a modest fee for admission, usually 10 cents. They played clubs from nearby towns. Teams sometimes came from as far as Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain and Cambridge. Mansfield's club teams were talented and won more games than they lost.
 But the Branch Street grounds was rugged. One account from an 1889 game against Mount Hope described "puddles four and five inches deep in some places." Still Mansfield sports fans showed up in support. One ballgame in 1892 was described as "magnificent" where the "cranks and shouters, including representatives from the clergy, town fathers, and other officials, were present in large numbers and cheered lustily."
 The Branch Street crowds were not always kind to visitors. That same year The Mansfield News decried poor sportsmanship on the Mansfield sidelines. They said of a game versus Attleboro: "It is perhaps too much to expect the "hurrah" element, which is made up largely of boys, will ever learn to be courteous and cease to jeer the errors of the visitors."
 A few weeks later the newspaper lamented the deplorable behavior of fans from a neighboring town by saying "most of them were under the influence of liquor, and one or two more than 'three sheets to the wind.'"
 In 1896 the high school baseball team was "waxed" by the grammar school boys by a score of 20-15. "The juniors won't be any happier over the event when they graduate," said the newspaper.
 Mansfield fans were loyal, vocal, and sometimes thrifty. A letter to the editor in 1902 asked why some were not willing to pay the price of admission.
 "Why so many grownups witnessed the sport from the street instead of entering the grounds is a conundrum that no self-respecting man can answer," the letter read.
 "Come in, gentlemen, and support the sport you seem so much to admire at a distance." It was signed "A Baseball Crank".
 By the 1890s high school football was also being played at the Branch Street grounds. The early high school football teams played sporadically and usually didn't even have a coach. Mansfield's club football teams also played at the grounds.
 At times the Branch Street grounds were used for challenge baseball games. Such as on July 4, 1899, when the Fire Department defeated S.W. Card Manufacturing with the stakes being a "collection purse." The Fire Department won 17-7. The game was followed by a "genuine Rhode Island clam bake." In later years longtime residents also recalled a circus visiting the Branch Street grounds.
 The land was owned by local builder David Eddy. He built houses on the grounds and it became Eddy Street.
 "To Mr. Eddy belongs the credit of developing this once waste land," said The Mansfield News in 1910. "It is now one of the most desirable locations in town."

TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Nothing can make the hair stand up on the back of your neck like arachnids.Despite their creepy, crawly reputation, arachnids are fascinating, diverse, and essential&nbsp;to the planet’s ecosystems. That’s why Discovery Science Place&nbsp;has unveiled a new exhibit focusing on arachnids and their various roles in our lives.The exhibit, which opened Saturday, July 11, features the largest display of live arachnids in North America -- around 100 live arachnids. Some of the species on display include the Tiger tarantula, the Mexican Red Knee tarantula, and tailless whip scorpions.“This is one of the goliath bird spiders, and it shed it’s skin just a day or two after it got here,” said Chris Rasure, referencing one of the massive arachnids now on display at DSP.“Some of the spiders that we have are as big as your hand. Some of them eat creatures as large as birds, lizards, and things of that nature. Luckily that’s not what we have to feed them. We are feeding them all crickets.”The Discovery Science Place (DSP) will unveil a new exhibit focusing on arachnids and their role in human culture.There will be hands-on activities including robot building, science experiments, and creating spider art. There will also be exhibitions of arachnids in modern-day medicine, film, and music. There will also be stories from arachnids in folklore.The exhibit will also feature a galley of spiders by photographer Julian Kamzol.&nbsp;“What I love about this exhibit is that it has an art component. It has a cultural component, a science component. You learn everything about arachnids in science, movies, and conservation,” Rasure said.Tickets for the exhibit&nbsp;will be $3 for members and $5 for non- members. Visitors do not have a purchase admission to the main museum.The Discovery Science Place (DSP) will unveil a new exhibit focusing on arachnids and their role in human culture.“If you don’t want to see a spider up close, you don’t have to see a spider up close,” Rasure laughed. “There are three large cubes of all the specimens inside and of course there all enclosed in their little habitat. You get as close as you want to.”The exhibit runs July 11 through Nov. 15. This exhibit will follow the same hours as the main museum, and all DSP COVID-19 health protocols are in effect.Copyright 2020 KLTV. All rights reserved.

It took me 90 days to muster courage to make the first visit to the office. For three months, I locked myself at home, working in sequestered comfort. Or discomfort, as some would say. The only excursions included the weekly trips, on and off, to the nearest paan shop 20 metres away. To be frank, it wasn't guts, but fear, which forced the decision. One set of fear--about the safety and health of my ageing mother--had kept me confined. Now, another set of dread--the one we still feel with trepidation--made me go to office. It's that dark anxiety of losing one's job. Masked with an N95--the New Yorker said those were used by the medical staff in the US--I reached the magazine's headquarters.

Burlington Bees general manager Kim Parker and her staff have had a rough go of it this spring and summer.
   
 With Minor League Baseball's recent announcement that there will be no 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Parker and her staff have had to get innovative to find ways to stay busy, remain active in the community and create ways to utilize Community Field.
   
 Their efforts have not gone unnoticed.
   
 On Monday, a film crew, along with correspondent Kevin Tibbles, were at Community Field to do a spotlight for the NBC Today Show, which is set to air on Sunday, July 26.
   
 The crew arrived late Monday morning to film Parker and head groundskeeper Jordan Barr as they worked on the field.
   
 Burlington has been tagged as one of 42 cities that could lose their affiliation, meaning there will be no Minor League Baseball in those cities. No official decision has been made on the contraction of the minor leagues.
   
 But on a warm, sun-drenched Monday, Community Field and the Burlington Bees were in the national spotlight.
   
 "This is huge because this is national exposure. It's just going to bring awareness to our small market. When I talked to the producer, I told her how we are a small staff, we're very involved in the community and this is for the community. When she told us we were picked, we were definitely ecstatic and really excited," said Parker, who is in her 20th season with the Bees, her third as general manager. "They reached out to me. They are wanting to do a Sunday Spotlight on one of the 42 teams. So I had an interview with their producer and then I had a follow-up. Then a couple days later the producer called us and said they want to do our story."
   
 "I understand there are a number of small-town teams across the country who are losing the team. Burlington is one of them. We've come to do a story on how The Boys of Summer aren't going to be here anymore and how it's going to affect the town," Tibbles said, moments after arriving in Burlington from Chicago. "The 'Today Show' producer in New York is the one who chose Burlington. I don't think it's gone unnoticed that 'If you build it, they will come' took place here in Iowa. I'm sure there will be a few lame puns along those lines in the script when I right it. This is Midwest small-town America. Why not go to the heart of the country to see what's going on."
   
 Burlington has been a member of the Class A Midwest League since 1962. Burlington has had baseball since 1889 with the inception of the Burlington Babies.
   
 Hall of Famers Billy Williams, Paul Molitor and Larry Walker all played in Burlington. The Bees won Midwest League championships in 1965, 1977, 1999 and 2008.
   
 While there has been no Minor League Baseball this summer at Community Field, Parker and her staff have opened the facility to allow local high school teams to play games there, something that has gone over well.
   
 "The cool thing is all of the players have come up to myself and the staff and thanked us and said how great of an experience it was," Parker said. "We do have some high school games sprinkled in our normal schedule, but there is so much wear and tear on the field that we don't have too many. This year we were able to have 14 different games during the month of July. It's worked out really well and there's a lot more kids who are getting to experience the field.
   
 "Since we are not having a 2020 season, not having any revenue for 18 months is a huge blow to any business. So having the high schools come out -- they want to highlight that, that we're giving back to the community by that aspect, as well."
   
 On Monday, the crew got plenty of shots of the field and Barr, who was busy watering the field, keeping it in pristine condition.
   
 "We're typically an all-hands-on-deck crew where everybody helps with everything. But his job is the field. He is very, very detailed-oriented when it comes to his field," Parker said of Barr. "We did hire a new groundskeeper. He loves the field and he keeps it in immaculate shape. We are really lucky. He has a lot of experience and a lot of education in it. We're lucky to have him. We don't have all the bells and whistles a lot of the other stadiums have. We always focus on cleanliness and keeping the facilities sharp. That's what we're known for."
   
 "You have a beautiful field. We're going to talk to the G.M. and touch on what kind of memories this town is going to have with the Bees," Tibbles said.
   
 Parker said that, because of COVID-19 restrictions in place, the film crew was not able to go inside the offices and clubhouses.
   
 But putting Burlington and the Bees in the national spotlight was just the kind of news Parker and the rest of the Bees' staff needs.
   
 "We really do need some positive news. But it's been great to have the high school games out here. We love baseball. That's part of our life. That's part of who we are. So not having any type of baseball was really weighing on all of our emotional spirits," Parker said. "We're trying to create awareness as to what is going on in these 42 communities that could potentially lose minor league baseball."
   
 Parker noted that while baseball is on hiatus and the future of the Bees remains in limbo, there are activities planned at Community Field in the near future.
   
 "We're looking at possibly doing some kind of concert or karaoke night or something here are the ballpark in August," Parker said. "We hope the community will come out and support us in any venture we may have. We're looking forward to the future."
   
 Tibbles, for one, can empathize with Parker and the Bees. As a baseball fan, he enjoys taking in an occasional Minor League Baseball game during the summer. It is a cheap, relaxing way to spend a lazy summer evening.
   
 "It's funny. I travel all over," Tibbles said. "Lots of times in the summer if I'm in a small town, I'll often go in and get a five-dollar ticket and a hot dog and go in grab a cold beer and sit outside and spend my evening watching a baseball game. It's a shame that you guys won't be able to do that here anymore."


--DocBreak--
He added: "It wasn’t really being talked about because, as players, we have a job to do and that is on the pitch. Anything behind the scenes is completely out of our department.
 "It is obviously fantastic news for the club. I feel that everyone from the kit men, to laundry staff, to us as players, work extremely hard to qualify, at minimum, for the Champions League each year and I think that is what we deserve.
 "We are second now in the league and so we should play in the Champions League next year. I am glad it has been overturned and roll on next year."

County treasurers began accepting antlerless deer license applications Monday from resident hunters.
 While purchasing my hunting license last week, the economic impact of hunting was noticeable. A number of hunters were already in the process of purchasing their license when I arrived at the hardware store, with more arriving as my transaction was completed. A large number of turkey decoys sat as a reminder to the difficulty retailers faced during the shutdown. Seasonal items such as spring gobbler hunting equipment and fishing gear were stocked just prior to many retailers shutting their doors.
 On July 20 nonresidents may apply for their antlerless license. Allocations for antlerless licenses are generous with WMU 2D offering 60,000 and WMU 2E offering 39,000. The first round of unsold licenses begins Aug. 3 with the second round starting Aug. 17.
 Hunters are permitted to possess up to three antlerless licenses, which should allow for some venison in the menu.
 Bears are on the move as berries ripen across the landscape. Sightings this month will be common despite the thick vegetation that largely impedes visibility. Last week on the outskirts of Indiana a nice-sized bear crossed the roadway in front of my truck. The bear was leaving a residential area quickly and I could see people out and about in their backyards.
 Living with wild-life is common in this area yet steps should be taken to avoid unnecessary conflict. It is important that people avoid providing food sources for bears as they can quickly learn where an easy meal is available. Bird feeders and garbage are two attractants to a bear that can easily be avoided by man. The bear season has been expanded this year, allowing hunters more chances at tagging a bear this year. Archery hunters should study the vital area of a bear as it differs slightly than a deer. Heavy arrows and broadheads should be used for hunting bears and now would be a good time to evaluate equipment.
 The drawing for elk licenses will be held Aug. 15 this year with the deadline for applying set at July 31. This year 164 licenses will be offered in the lottery with all applicants having a chance at drawing a tag. The elk herd offers much to the state in regards to recreational value and the hunt is an excellent way to manage the population. Visiting the elk range this summer for some sightseeing and exploration can make for an exciting trip. A visitor center is the focal point of the area with a number of businesses offering products and services geared towards the elk viewer. In the heat of summer, the bulk of wildlife movements occur in the early morning and late evening hours.
 Deer antlers are growing by the day and the buck in the area are beginning to show some serious head gear. Scouting during the summer months may reveal a buck in plain sight that will soon disappear into a nocturnal pattern. The use of magnification allows a hunter to set up at a distance and watch deer feed without risk of spooking them.
 Currently buck are hanging out with other buck and the chance to see several racked deer together is a possibility. While mature buck are elusive, the knowledge of one existing in an area can allow the hunter to be patient and wait for the perfect opportunity.

 Larry is survived by his wife, Linda Leavitt; his son and his wife Larry and Michelle Leavitt of Littleton; his grandchildren, Miranda and Ryan Daveau of Massachusetts, Jeremy Leavitt and Margaret Morlang of Barrington, N.H., Samantha Alfieri, Cameron Alfieri, and Gabrielle Leavitt all of Littleton, N.H.; his great-grandchildren Landon, Ella, and Cole Daveau of Massachusetts; Holden, Esme, and Braxten of Littleton, N.H.
 Larry was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He enjoyed being around family and was always telling jokes. He also enjoyed hunting, fishing, sugaring and going to camp with friends and family. He was often seen working around his house. He was described by his family as the most loving, hardworking, selfless, brave man you would ever meet. He had a sarcasm about him that would always make everyone around him laugh. He will be greatly missed by anyone who knew him.
 He is predeceased in death by his brother Donald Leavitt; his mother Arlene Leavitt; his father Donald Leavitt; and his grandson Brodie Leavitt who welcomed him with open arms on the second anniversary of his death. They had a plan and his family feels great comfort in knowing they are together.
 There will be no formal services per Larry’s wishes. There will be a celebration of life privately for close family and friends. In lieu of flowers Larry would have wanted donations made to the Brodie Leavitt Memorial Fund.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — With a months-long layoff, the attention surrounding Mike Fiers has significantly subsided.
 He can go about his business behind the scenes again just as he prefers it.
 As the whistleblower in the Houston Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, Fiers has reiterated he wants nothing more than to move forward with the season. Finally, he might be able to do that.
 The Oakland Athletics are on the cusp of starting the shortened 60-game season and ready to chase another playoff berth, knowing those mighty Astros likely stand in the way of an AL West crown.
 “Every game is huge. We know that," right fielder Stephen Piscotty said. "We know we can’t get off to a slow start.”
 Originally, the Astros were set to visit the Oakland Coliseum on March 30 for the reigning division champions' first road series of 2020. Now, they won't come to town until Aug. 7.

It has been three months since my daughter last stepped out, having hurried back home from the city where she studies just in time to beat the nat­ionwide COVID-19 lockdown enforced end-March. Though the stay-at-home has not ended her trademark tantrums, it has definitely put paid to her favourite pastimes such as long drives and dining out. My ability to do things has been severely limited too, including the umpteen coffee breaks in the company of colleagues. Unable to live life the way we are used to, the forced restrictions rankled. Chastised--one word comes readily to my mind when asked what I learned from the pandemic. We have been shown our place, robbed overnight of the simple pleasures. But nothing hurt me more than the suspension of the print edition of _Outlook_ once the country shuttered down.

Dear Dave,   What exactly is the debt snowball, and why is it such an important part of your plan?   Lee
 Dear Lee,   The debt snowball is Baby Step 2 of my plan for getting out of debt and gaining control of your finances. Specifically, it's the part of the plan where you sit down with your budget and look at all the money you owe. Then, list your debts from smallest to largest - except for your home - and pay them off in that order.
 I know, there are all sorts of arguments about paying off the ones with the highest interest rates first. But this is psychology class, not math. Personal finance is 80% behavior and 20% knowledge. Besides, if you were so great at math you wouldn't have debt, would you? Pay off your debts from smallest to largest, unless there's a huge emergency, such as you're facing foreclosure, or the IRS is banging on your door.
 The reason we pay off debts from smallest to largest is to build confidence and enthusiasm by notching quick wins. If you go on a diet and lose weight in the first week, you'll probably stay on that diet. If you go on a diet and gain weight, or go weeks with no visible progress, chances are you'll quit. When you start the debt snowball, and in the first few days pay off a couple of debts, it lights a fire underneath you, and you start to believe you really can do it.
 After you list the debts from smallest to largest, pay the minimum payment to stay current on all the debts except the smallest. Every dollar you can squeeze out of your budget goes toward the smallest debt until it is paid. Once the smallest one is paid, the payment from that debt - plus any extra "found" money - is added to the next smallest debt. Then, when debt number two is paid off, you take the money that you used to pay on number one and number two, and you pay it on number three. When three is paid, you attack number four and so on. A lot of folks get to the bottom of the list and find they can pay well over $1,000 a month on a student loan or a car. At that point, it won't take long to bust out and be debt-free except for your home.
 The main elements that make the debt snowball so powerful are budgeting, getting current before you start the debt snowball, the smallest-to-largest pay-off, sacrifice, discipline and focused intensity. If you think the debt snowball is just another trick, or something you might kind of try, it won't work. You've got to go all-in to win!

That decision may ultimately motivate the massive New York City school district to follow suit. New York remains on the far side of a brutal springtime outbreak that nearly brought the city to its knees, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration is overseeing various plans to reopen schools with a wary eye on the rising national infection rate. "We're not going to use our children as guinea pigs," said Cuomo during a Monday press briefing.

Immigration officials, however, argued that they told colleges all along that any guidance prompted by the pandemic was subject to change. They said the rule was consistent with existing law barring international students from taking classes entirely online. Federal officials said they were providing leniency by allowing students to keep their visas even if they study online from abroad.

If you’ve watched or heard the current riots, you’ve probably noticed that the “ ‘F-word’ is having a moment,” Conor Dinnison quips at Spectator USA. “Once the razor-sharp ‘Piss Christ’ of the English lexicon,” the F-word now seems “neutered of semantic utility or illicit charm.” Hard-left protesters are using the F-word as “a weapon against order, against beauty, against the conscionable.” Because of its overuse, now even the ability to desecrate is “irrevocably lost,” with the erstwhile counterculture unable to “rail against the status quo” because it “is the status quo.” The real counterculture these days stands for order, and it uses “lingo worthy of its high ideals.” It should keep on using high language: “Desecration requires little in the way of skill or investment,” after all, “but creation does, in spades.”

St. Johnsbury Public Works Director Steven Beauregard is purchasing a truck for his department that he’s already pretty familiar with.
 The Select Board on Monday approved Beauregard’s request to spend $8,500 to purchase a used, 2012 Ford F-550 work truck that until recently was owned by the public works department in St. Albans — which Beauregard ran as public works director from 2008-2016.
 “I got the truck brand new and set it up the way we used ‘em in St. Albans,” said Beauregard as he addressed the Select Board on Monday. “And honestly, that truck was about $100,000 back then … it has a plow wing, body sander, it’s all set up for liquid … it’ll do everything that we want it to do.”
 The town of St. Johnsbury bid unsuccessfully on the truck when St. Albans put it up for sale.
 The winning bidder was a private party who wanted to turn it around and re- sell the truck for a profit. Beauregard said the purchase price remains a good one for the town of St. Johnsbury.
 “It’s still a good enough buy,” said Beauregard. “It’s worth purchasing … I think it’s something we could use a couple, three years and at least break even on.”
 Beauregard said he plans to use money the department saved this year when it purchased a used excavator instead of a new one, as well as money saved on another truck purchase and the sale of some old equipment for the purchase.
 “We certainly have the money there to offset the cost of buying of this truck,” said Beauregard.
 Beauregard said the town will also benefit when it’s done using the truck in a few years because he plans to strip some of its specialized equipment for use on a new truck.

CHICAGO (AP) — Jake Burger just wanted to play again. Some real competition after a couple of major injuries.
 He found a spot — practically in his own backyard.
 Burger is going to play in a local league this summer in his hometown of St. Louis after the Chicago White Sox approved the plan for their first-round pick in the 2017 amateur draft. It's a chance for the third baseman to get back on the field after he tore his left Achilles tendon twice, sidelining him for each of the previous two seasons.
 “I want to get some live at-bats,” Burger told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. “I think that's the most important thing for me right now, is trying to simulate a full season, just by these at-bats and face some pro guys just off to the side, too. So that's kind of how it started.”
 The cancellation of this year's minor league season left prospects like Burger without anywhere to go for game action that could help continue their development. Some major league teams are keeping their top farmhands on their taxi squad, but there isn't room for everyone.
 Left-hander Garrett Crochet, the No. 11 pick in this year's draft, was among 16 players selected for workouts at the White Sox's auxiliary site in suburban Chicago. But Burger wasn't on the list when it was announced Tuesday.
 “I feel badly for these guys, you know, from top to bottom, that were going to be in the minor leagues this year,” said Chris Getz, the director of player development for the White Sox. “Every year is a precious year, certainly some more than others. But, you know, not to get the at-bats or the innings or just play games and compete, there’s a downside to that.”
