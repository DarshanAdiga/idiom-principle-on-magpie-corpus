Despite a drop in the unemployment rate and 661,000 more jobs added last month, the September jobs report shows the US jobs market still has a long way to go before recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.
 The number of long-term unemployed Americans is rising, as is the number of people who have permanently lost jobs rather than being temporarily furloughed. Meanwhile, the share of Americans working or looking for work declined last month.
 All of these suggest that many workers who lost their jobs are having difficulty returning to work.
 ## Long-term unemployment had the biggest spike on record
 The monthly change in the number of people who have been unemployed for at least 27 weeks was the largest increase since this number was first tracked in 1948. 781,000 more people were long-term unemployed in September than in August, with a total of 2.4 million. That is 19.1% of the total number of people unemployed in the US, per a chart from Axios.
 "Longer and longer durations of unemployment are a sign that the shock from the coronavirus is becoming more and more enduring and that the ability for people to quickly be recalled to old jobs seems to be fading," Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed told Business Insider.

KEYSTONE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota tourism officials estimate the Mount Rushmore Independence Day event last July generated $2 million in direct spending for the state's economy. Deputy tourism director, Wanda Goodman, recently told the state Tourism Advisory Board the July 3 event also generated $22 million in advertising value for South Dakota because of media coverage. President Donald Trump was present for the celebration in the Black Hills when attendees signed up for a ticket lottery. Based on applications for tickets, tourism officials say 10% of the event attendees were Black Hills residents and each spent about $54 per day; 22% of those present were from other parts of South Dakota and each spent about $115 per day; and 68% of those attending the event were from out of state, with each spending about $120 per day, the Black Hills Pionee r reported. The cost to stage the event, including $350,000 for fireworks, was about $1.5 million. Tourism officials said Google searches for Mount Rushmore reached an all-time high and web traffic for TravelSouthDakota.com saw an increase of 872% compared to July 3-4, 2019.

Tom Boyd was just 13 when some of the responsibility for running the family farm landed on his shoulders. Sixteen years later, he and his brother David are running the diverse Lakeside Farm enterprise at Carrickfinn in the Rosses along Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way. &lsquo;I take lots of photos which keeps people engaged and generates more traffic to our Facebook page&rsquo;We didn&rsquo;t have a start-up cost. We owned and inherited the land and sold old stock to pay for the new stock, so we didn&rsquo;t have to part with any money as such.Yes, it would have been, but in keeping with the ethos we were brought up with, we didn&rsquo;t apply. We like to own everything we have and don&rsquo;t like to borrow if we can avoid it.Yes, when you produce or sell food you have to register with the Health Service Executive.It was over a year. We bought the new ram as we wanted to diversify and always had the idea that we would produce our own lamb product.We did the majority of the research ourselves, online but we also spoke to Teagasc advisers and liaised with the Department of Agriculture.Yes, general farm insurance covers everything we do.We started advertising on Facebook and that&rsquo;s how our customers order. Social media has proven to be very effective. We have such a scenic setting so I take lots of photos which keeps people engaged and generates more traffic to our page.We are only up and running with lamb recently and everything has been going fine. I do think that by offering the full lamb, rather than smaller quantities, it did affect orders. We hope we will soon be in a position to offer smaller quantities.

Columbia, South Carolina, is trending noticeably warmer in recent decades. I took a look back at the weather records, which have been kept in Columbia since 1888. Incredibly, the top eight warmest years on record have occurred in the past 20 years. This point really hits close to home as I look into the October garden and see citrus ripening in a climate that's historically too cold for them. Columbia has broken or tied 17 warm temperature records in the month of October in the past 10 years, and 0 cold weather records in that time period.

The company is a company that wants to be on the right side of history and do the right thing. To have them step up in the way that they did was great for me as a Black man but then also to kind of be in support of projects like this that help drive the conversation forward,” he said. “It just became a special experience.”
