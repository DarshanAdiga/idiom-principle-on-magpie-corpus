Pose's lack of Emmy nominations is not sitting well with the fandom and cast. The show about the gender non-affirming ballroom culture in 80s New York has been a milestone in the trans and LGBTQ cultural narrative. Pose actor Angelica Ross also spoke out about the snub. "Ultimately, I need you to understand that I am so tired. Because those of you that know me know that I'm not just working in front of the screen or behind the lens or whatever. I'm working around the clock to get our society to value trans lives and Black trans lives. And listen, I feel what I feel because I feel like there is nothing we can do," she said on Instagram.

On an individual level, if you are travelling on a vacation and you are offered a chance to get up close to a sedated tiger or any wild animal for a picture - you should say no. These animals are almost always trafficked from the wild and transported halfway across the world and then exploited for wildlife tourism. Many wildlife tourism operations also have a sinister back- door nexus with wildlife trafficking syndicates - with many tigers ending up in the black market trade.

And you’re right. Streets, regardless if in the cities or out in rural areas…we’re always in the "car" mindset. Now we really need to be in a community mindset. And it's a challenge that we’re facing everywhere, but I’m going to go back to focusing on cities because we’ve seen a huge rise in pedestrian fatalities. We’re at an all-time high in the past 30 years and cars are safer, but streets have not been safer for pedestrians and that’s across the board. Most pedestrian deaths are taking place across cities and they are mostly taking place in lower income neighborhoods. And that gets back to what we’re seeing. A lot less safe sidewalks, a lot less lighting. The kind of investment and safe streets is not taken as seriously there as in wealthier neighborhoods. So regardless of what zip code you’re in Indiana, it’s something we really have to make sure the streets are safer for everybody, everywhere.

ISLAMABAD: The opposition has decided to give tough time to the government today (Thursday) in the joint sitting of Parliament's two houses when the seven bills will be placed before it for approval which have been either rejected by the Senate or have gone time barred due to non-approval of the upper house within ninety days of transmission from the other house after their adoption by the National Assembly.
 Well-placed parliamentary sources told The News here Wednesday evening that the session of the joint sitting will be held at 3 pm and adjourned later in the evening. The sitting could be adjourned till next week if the agenda business isn't transacted till the time of adjournment today. The House could meet again immediately after Eid holidays. It will be adjourned sine die today.
 Prime Minister Imran Khan will also attend the joint sitting while leader of opposition Shahbaz Sharif will take permission from his doctors on Thursday morning for travelling to Islamabad from Lahore.
 The sources pointed out that united opposition has already evolved its strategy regarding the upcoming bills which have been placed on the agenda. The opposition has decided to oppose the so-called Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) with full force. It will use every parliamentary weapon including filibustering to block the particular law since its firm view that the piece of legislation in question would jeopardise the national interests beyond imagination. The opposition is interested to consign the bills to the joint committee of the two houses for further consideration.
 Leader of the opposition in Senate and Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) Chairman Raja Muhammad Zafarul Haq, while talking to this scribe, said Wednesday evening that despite few members of opposition's leaving for their respective areas in the evening, the opposition will outnumber the government if headcount is made. He maintained that due to absence of these members margin of victory for the opposition could be reduced but it will succeed in defeating the government in counting.
 He was of the view that on one side the government is terming the bill's passage imperative for the national interest but at the same time exploiting indecent tactics for their adoption. The members belonging to the opposition in Parliament who have gone to their areas, informed their leadership that they could come back to Islamabad by making emergency arrangement provided they are asked to reach the federal capital at any cost.
 The government was busy in establishing contacts with its members who are not present in the federal capital till late in the evening so that it could win the contest. One of the major allies of the government could stay away from the House at the time of head counts and that could cause serious embarrassment for the government.
 The sources said that government's stalwarts were trying to contact all group leaders of the ally parties and hopeful to bring their groups in the House. The government has taken a bold decision by bypassing the opposition and instead having dialogue with it, opted to take risk of summoning the joint sitting. It will be an eventful day in the Parliament today.
 On paper the joint opposition has at least 14 votes superiority over the government in aggregate. In case the estranged allies of the government decided to vote for the opposition, the situation could become entirely different, the sources added. The opposition leader in the Parliament had their marathon meeting late in the evening for fine tuning their strategy since some government stalwarts have contacted them for rapprochement. They will continue their consultations today as well. It is difficult that the government and opposition could develop any consensus in the matter, the sources said.

Informed sources told The News that the government will agree to changes - far more than what it has suggested in its proposed draft shared with the opposition.
 The opposition parties are also in contact with the friends and feel assured that this time despite the initial hiccups, there would be a meaningful discussion between the two sides on the matter. A cabinet member confirmed to The News that this time the government has been told by the friends to engage opposition for much-needed amendments to the NAB law without achieving which neither political stability could be attained nor the bureaucracy and businessmen would feel secure.
 The cabinet member, who is a member of the government team that is negotiating the NAB law amendment issue with the opposition, however insisted that even friends do not want to make the anti-graft body toothless.
 He said that the government is willing to compromise on much-abused NAB power to arrest besides addressing other procedural issues like reducing the period of remand. He, however, said that excluding serious offences as suggested by the opposition’s draft is not acceptable.
 The government source said that it is also not acceptable to the government to restrict the NAB from going beyond five years in cases of corruption, as is the desire of the opposition parties.
 An important opposition leader, who is a member of the committee that was recently constituted to discuss the NAB law amendments, when approached told The News that the opposition had joined the discussions with the government on the issue after they were assured by friends that the government would be serious this time.
 Following the same assurance, the opposition had handed over its draft amendment bill to the friends. The opposition source said that even though in their initial interaction between government and opposition a deadlock hit the negotiations, yet there is a hope for meeting again on the issue because the friends are hopeful.
 On the NAB law amendment issue, the ruling party does not want to go too far insisting that weakening the Bureau would mean negation of PTI’s manifesto which promised ruthless accountability and zero tolerance for corruption.
 Opposition, however, views that NAB is an institution that has been repeatedly used for persecution and political victimisation of opposition voices. It is said that even if the NAB’s power to arrest is clipped, there would still be a lot that would be abused by the Bureau to harass and hound the opposition.
 Comparison of the draft bills of both the sides, however, show that the government and the opposition are at least on the same page as far as securing the civil bureaucracy and businessmen from the injustices of the NAB.
 According to a source, next month – August - will be critical for NAB law amendments, as the government would try to complete its FATF related legislation by end of next month. The government knows that consensus legislation on FATF related laws will require consensus related changes in the NAB law.

ISLAMABAD: In the backdrop of great public scrutiny over the matter of dual nationalities held by cabinet members, Tania Aidrus and Dr Zafar Mirza on Wednesday said that they have resigned from their posts as the Special Assistants to Prime Minister (SAPM) on Digital Pakistan and National Health, respectively.
 The resignations have been accepted by the prime minister. The announcement came amid criticism levelled against several special assistants over possession of dual citizenship and after the list of assets they own was made public by the government.
 Ex-Google executive Aidrus, in a post on Twitter, said she was resigning "in the greater public interest" after she faced criticism for holding a Canadian nationality.
 "Criticism levied towards the state as a consequence of my citizenship status is clouding the purpose of Digital Pakistan. In the greater public interest, I have submitted my resignation from the SAPM role," she wrote on Twitter.
 "I will continue to serve my country and the PM's vision to my best ability," she added.
 In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Aidrus said it had been an "honour and privilege" to serve him. "I returned to Pakistan with the singular intent to contribute and develop the vision of a Digital Pakistan, a concept which you have always voiced and I share.
 "I always was and shall be a Pakistani," she added.
 The former special assistant said that she believes that the recent discourse about her Canadian nationality -- which she said is a consequence of her birth -- "is a distraction to my ability to execute on the long term vision for a Digital Pakistan".
 "It is unfortunate that a Pakistani's desire to serve Pakistan is clouded by such issues," Aidrus remarked.
 "I shall continue to serve your vision and Pakistan through initiatives both in the private and public domain, where possible," she added.
 According to details released by the government earlier this month, Aidrus has four immovable properties held outside Pakistan -- two in the US and one each in the UK and Singapore.
 The properties, when converted to Pakistani rupees, have a value of Rs452.69 million. The ones in Singapore and the US are under mortgage.
 The premier's aide has no property within Pakistan.
 She has an investment in a venture capital worth Rs12.51 million and has declared remittances from foreign account to Pakistan worth $95,790.
 Aidrus also has a bank balance in various accounts both in Pakistan and abroad worth Rs34.39 million, whereas her husband has cash in the bank worth Rs9.29 million in foreign accounts, the documents revealed.
 Moments after Aidrus resigned, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said he has tendered his resignation from the post today.
 The SAPM did not divulge further details regarding his resignation but said he is "satisfied to leave at a time when COVID-19 has declined in Pakistan as a result of a grand national effort".
 In a subsequent tweet, Dr Mirza explained that "due to the ongoing negative discussion about the role of [special assistants] and criticism on the [government], I choose to resign. Pakistani people deserve a better health care."
 He said he has "worked sincerely to contribute to this cause" and expressed confidence that the country will "emerge out of COVID-19 with a stronger healthcare system".
 Dr Mirza owns assets worth Rs50.7 million, including a house worth Rs20 million and two plots worth Rs30 million. His wife has jewelry of approximately Rs2 million and the family owns furniture worth approximately Rs2 million.
 His cash at bank accounts exceeds Rs1.3 million.
 He has no other nationality.
 Separately, sources informed Geo News Wednesday evening that according to certain documents, Dr Mirza had played a role in illegally importing drugs from India despite a ban. He, alongside another adviser, were named during an inquiry carried out on the prime minister's orders.
 PM Imran wanted to end the power of pharmaceutical companies to independently raise prices, the documents indicated, adding that the SAPM had failed to appoint heads of hospitals and medical institutions in Islamabad.
 Dr Mirza had also withdrawn a summary curtailing the powers of pharmaceutical companies; however, it was submitted again on the premier's orders. The special assistant had opposed the summary in a Cabinet meeting earlier.
 PM Imran, however, had approved a summary pertaining to the pharmaceutical companies in the Cabinet, the sources added citing the documents. He had also wanted to remove Dr Mirza after the drug scandal but did not do so due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Earlier, on August 9, 2019, the Cabinet banned imports from India, the documents said. That decision was amended on August 25 by the Prime Minister's Office instead of the federal cabinet; however, the PM Office is not authorised to give such approvals in light of the Supreme Court's decision.
 Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce, Textiles, Industries, and Investment, Abdul Razak Dawood, then held a meeting with Dr Mirza.
 The commerce ministry had written a letter to the Cabinet Division on August 24 for an amendment to the decision, the documents showed. According to the rules, the Cabinet had to be approached within 24 hours for an amendment to the decision.
 An inquiry of Dr Mirza's communication with Muhammad Ashraf -- then the director general of the commerce ministry's trade policy -- was completed. When questions were raised in the Cabinet, Dr Mirza had expressed ignorance.

Tiger conservation is only possible when the people who live alongside tigers are a conservation priority. Tigers are huge drivers of the ecotourism industry in India, which employs large numbers of people from local communities - and with tourism shutting down, these communities have been hit the hardest. If you're a wildlife enthusiast, I would recommend donating to small-scale grassroots conservation organisations like the Last Wilderness Foundation, Tiger Watch or TRACT that are working tirelessly to protect wildlife and empower local communities that have been economically impacted by the pandemic. Find ways to support them financially, or otherwise. I think if we support organizations like on the frontlines of tiger conservation, then we can protect tigers in the long term.

There are some signs that emerging markets are outperforming, but we will have to wait and see whether that happens. In the 2003 to 2007 period, the dollar was in a secular bear market. It went down for five years on the trot and emerging markets went up five years on the trot. So, they did extremely well versus the SPX. We have not seen that outperformance as yet. Of course it is early days and I do not know whether we are in a secular bear market to the dollar, but the US stock market continues to be the leader of the pack. What is happening in the currency markets is not currently being reflected in equities.

The resignations have been accepted by the prime minister. The announcement came amid criticism levelled against several special assistants over possession of dual citizenship and after the list of assets they own was made public by the government.
 Ex-Google executive Aidrus, in a post on Twitter, said she was resigning “in the greater public interest” after she faced criticism for holding a Canadian nationality.
 “Criticism levied towards the state as a consequence of my citizenship status is clouding the purpose of Digital Pakistan. In the greater public interest, I have submitted my resignation from the SAPM role,” she wrote on Twitter.
 “I will continue to serve my country and the PM’s vision to my best ability,” she added.
 In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Aidrus said it had been an “honour and privilege” to serve him. “I returned to Pakistan with the singular intent to contribute and develop the vision of a Digital Pakistan, a concept which you have always voiced and I share.
 “I always was and shall be a Pakistani,” she added.
 The former special assistant said that she believes that the recent discourse about her Canadian nationality — which she said is a consequence of her birth — “is a distraction to my ability to execute on the long term vision for a Digital Pakistan”.
 “It is unfortunate that a Pakistani’s desire to serve Pakistan is clouded by such issues,” Aidrus remarked.
 “I shall continue to serve your vision and Pakistan through initiatives both in the private and public domain, where possible,” she added.
 According to details released by the government earlier this month, Aidrus has four immovable properties held outside Pakistan — two in the US and one each in the UK and Singapore.
 The properties, when converted to Pakistani rupees, have a value of Rs452.69 million. The ones in Singapore and the US are under mortgage.
 The premier’s aide has no property within Pakistan.
 She has an investment in a venture capital worth Rs12.51 million and has declared remittances from foreign account to Pakistan worth $95,790.
 Aidrus also has a bank balance in various accounts both in Pakistan and abroad worth Rs34.39 million, whereas her husband has cash in the bank worth Rs9.29 million in foreign accounts, the documents revealed.
 Moments after Aidrus resigned, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said he has tendered his resignation from the post today.
 The SAPM did not divulge further details regarding his resignation but said he is “satisfied to leave at a time when COVID-19 has declined in Pakistan as a result of a grand national effort”.
 In a subsequent tweet, Dr Mirza explained that “due to the ongoing negative discussion about the role of [special assistants] and criticism on the [government], I choose to resign. Pakistani people deserve a better health care.”
 He said he has “worked sincerely to contribute to this cause” and expressed confidence that the country will “emerge out of COVID-19 with a stronger healthcare system”.
 Dr Mirza owns assets worth Rs50.7 million, including a house worth Rs20 million and two plots worth Rs30 million. His wife has jewelry of approximately Rs2 million and the family owns furniture worth approximately Rs2 million.
 His cash at bank accounts exceeds Rs1.3 million.
 He has no other nationality.
 Separately, sources informed Geo News Wednesday evening that according to certain documents, Dr Mirza had played a role in illegally importing drugs from India despite a ban. He, alongside another adviser, were named during an inquiry carried out on the prime minister’s orders.
 PM Imran wanted to end the power of pharmaceutical companies to independently raise prices, the documents indicated, adding that the SAPM had failed to appoint heads of hospitals and medical institutions in Islamabad.
 Dr Mirza had also withdrawn a summary curtailing the powers of pharmaceutical companies; however, it was submitted again on the premier’s orders. The special assistant had opposed the summary in a Cabinet meeting earlier.
 PM Imran, however, had approved a summary pertaining to the pharmaceutical companies in the Cabinet, the sources added citing the documents. He had also wanted to remove Dr Mirza after the drug scandal but did not do so due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Earlier, on August 9, 2019, the Cabinet banned imports from India, the documents said. That decision was amended on August 25 by the Prime Minister’s Office instead of the federal cabinet; however, the PM Office is not authorised to give such approvals in light of the Supreme Court’s decision.
 Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce, Textiles, Industries, and Investment, Abdul Razak Dawood, then held a meeting with Dr Mirza.
 The commerce ministry had written a letter to the Cabinet Division on August 24 for an amendment to the decision, the documents showed. According to the rules, the Cabinet had to be approached within 24 hours for an amendment to the decision.
 An inquiry of Dr Mirza’s communication with Muhammad Ashraf — then the director general of the commerce ministry’s trade policy — was completed. When questions were raised in the Cabinet, Dr Mirza had expressed ignorance.

ISLAMABAD: The deadlock between government and opposition on the issue of NAB law amendments is not expected to prolong, as the influential 'friends' are keen to get the issue settled for much-needed political and economic stability.
 Informed sources told The News that the government will agree to changes - far more than what it has suggested in its proposed draft shared with the opposition.
 The opposition parties are also in contact with the friends and feel assured that this time despite the initial hiccups, there would be a meaningful discussion between the two sides on the matter. A cabinet member confirmed to The News that this time the government has been told by the friends to engage opposition for much-needed amendments to the NAB law without achieving which neither political stability could be attained nor the bureaucracy and businessmen would feel secure.
 The cabinet member, who is a member of the government team that is negotiating the NAB law amendment issue with the opposition, however insisted that even friends do not want to make the anti-graft body toothless.
 He said that the government is willing to compromise on much-abused NAB power to arrest besides addressing other procedural issues like reducing the period of remand. He, however, said that excluding serious offences as suggested by the opposition's draft is not acceptable.
 The government source said that it is also not acceptable to the government to restrict the NAB from going beyond five years in cases of corruption, as is the desire of the opposition parties.
 An important opposition leader, who is a member of the committee that was recently constituted to discuss the NAB law amendments, when approached told The News that the opposition had joined the discussions with the government on the issue after they were assured by friends that the government would be serious this time.
 Following the same assurance, the opposition had handed over its draft amendment bill to the friends. The opposition source said that even though in their initial interaction between government and opposition a deadlock hit the negotiations, yet there is a hope for meeting again on the issue because the friends are hopeful.
 On the NAB law amendment issue, the ruling party does not want to go too far insisting that weakening the Bureau would mean negation of PTI's manifesto which promised ruthless accountability and zero tolerance for corruption.
 Opposition, however, views that NAB is an institution that has been repeatedly used for persecution and political victimisation of opposition voices. It is said that even if the NAB's power to arrest is clipped, there would still be a lot that would be abused by the Bureau to harass and hound the opposition.
 Comparison of the draft bills of both the sides, however, show that the government and the opposition are at least on the same page as far as securing the civil bureaucracy and businessmen from the injustices of the NAB.
 According to a source, next month - August - will be critical for NAB law amendments, as the government would try to complete its FATF related legislation by end of next month. The government knows that consensus legislation on FATF related laws will require consensus related changes in the NAB law.

When you look at your portfolio, you cannot be just driven by momentum and what is in the thick of things, says the strategist and investor. As an investor, are you brave enough to contra buy right now? There is distress in the economy and segments like travel and tourism, hotels, aviation, multiplexes. Is this the time to buy? Whenever the economy recovers, these stocks are bound to do well?Absolutely. When you look at your portfolio, you cannot be just driven by momentum and what is in the thick of things because no matter what I see, I could be wrong and that is the nature of the world, the world transforms before we know. Every investor knows that there is something called reversion to mean. The question is whether the reversion to mean is going to happen in six months, one year or two years but since it is the nature of Nifty for example, or the Sensex to outperform, it is very difficult for an investor to keep coping with that in order to beat the market. There has to be a consequence in your portfolio that you believe will bounce back. Now the first criteria is that the business should not be destroyed. As an example, I turned bullish on the auto segment several months back and the argument was logical and I do not say it is illogical that there is a disruption there which among other things has to do with e-vehicles. Tesla has proven that what e-vehicles are doing but at the same time, because of the migration to rural areas, people use things like motorcycles and scooters to commute a lot. Some of the European countries for reasons of social distancing are also moving to scooters. Many parts of Europe are very fond of scooters and motorcycles. That balance will always be struck between the price of a company and the opportunity, if you believe that is going to be destroyed. When you come to hotels, the largest listed company is Indian Hotels. The Indian Hotels market cap is about Rs 6,000-7,000 crore and that seems to be ridiculous. But you know that they may not sell their hotels. They have at the same time comforted you with the fact that they are not going to buy more hotels. So, as and when they generate cash, it is not going to be put into buying assets. They are reinventing the model. Tata SATS which caters to all the airlines is now not doing so well because the airlines are not doing well and they are migrating that business into the equivalent of a Cloud kitchen and just developing an app which is called as Qmin which is quick minutes. Obviously, Tatas have the bandwidth of TCS and some of their other companies to understand technology well and now they have come and say we deliver the food to your home. The contra argument is going to be that some part of the business will come back, but it may be so expensive that I may occasionally do this and not frequently. But if the business moves towards Tata SATS and they come and say we are using our Cloud sort of business to deliver, then are you trying to say that the market cap of some of the QSR businesses will not get bridged if not equated because these guys will hopefully do a great job than their new businesses. So that form of innovation will always happen and at some point of time later you will come and say look I am so sick of sitting in my home that I am just waiting for Covid to get over and then I am happy to go into a hotel. They have rules in some parts of India that if you book a hotel, you have to book it for five days if you are going on vacation so they are guaranteed five days of stay no matter what! The other work from home beneficiaries if one can term them that is Zerodha and other platform companies because of the rise in hobby trading or Robinhood traders. But the other ones like the laptops, TVs, Netflix and other OTT platforms, telecom consumption and a lot of ancillaries stand to benefit from the work from home models?Absolutely and that is why I said that the market has got a dichotomy; there are businesses that are doing phenomenally well and there are businesses that are struggling and if you look at an entire pie and you reshuffle the money that exists in that pie, then you discover that it is clearly moving towards one side of the market vis-à-vis the others. But the moves appear to be a frenzy and only time will tell is also somewhat justified by the migration of a way of life. The very fact that we transact, watch Netflix. An ordinary housewife because of the need for her to reinvent the food and to continue to have a social interaction, we have seen the amount of innovation that is happening in food. That is exposing India to newer levels of food that they perhaps had not experimented with. All that goes well for the economy, for consumer companies because they have substituted some part of their eating out budgets into buying these newer kind of food, cheese, olive oil to experiment at home. At the end of the day, man is a social animal. We are going to have to bridge the gap between humanity and social at some point of time and we will again have new businesses -- whether they are entertainment, collaborative or preventive and whether we will allow somebody to come into your home and set up a nice entertainment but at a certain price!
