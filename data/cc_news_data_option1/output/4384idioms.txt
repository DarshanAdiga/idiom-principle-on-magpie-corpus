Brexit trade talks are set to continue into mid-November amid reports of progress, but there is a long way to go. Meanwhile, shrinking UK private sector and negative rates are set to weigh on GBP, economists at ANZ Bank apprise. Key quotes "The UK and EU are engaged in intense negotiations to break the deadlock in the bilateral trade talks. There is hope of progress emerging on level playing field arrangements and state aid, with both sides working towards a dispute resolution mechanism. Fisheries remain a barrier. Economically small, it is a very emotive topic." "Recent optimism does not obviate the fact that much progress still needs to be made in the talks and the outcome is uncertain. Irrespective of whether there will be agreement on tariffs and quota-free access, trade friction is set to rise. Border checks and bureaucracy will slow down the flow of goods and increase costs. Nontariff barriers are a significant risk in the absence of a comprehensive agreement." "In the UK, the COVID-19 economic shock is curtailing the government's earlier spending plans. Public sector debt is now 103.5% of GDP vs 80.8% at the end of 2019. The government has cancelled its three-year spending review. The risk is that a smaller private sector will carry the onus for re-engineering growth and containing debt. Disinflationary pressures are intense, and we expect the BoE to move to negative interest rates next year, which will weigh on GBP."

When children are adopted into a family, they are taken into the new household as they are – with all their physical features and their DNA intact. That’s what it means to adopt someone or something – to change the home, but not the one who is moving from one place to another.
 Societies, too, can adopt – not just children, but features from another culture. Power lines and electricity, for instance. Or shoes, or beer, or schools, or even new religions. The list of items adopted from abroad could go on and on, as we all know.
 Children may have been created and formed in their birth family, but they are capable of being changed in other ways to better fit into their new environment. Whether intentionally or not, kids find themselves making adjustments to accommodate their situation. Their mealtimes may change along with the food they’re given; they may dress differently; they might have to get used to a new round of activities. And so when they’re adopted they usually also adapt to fit into their new family.
 What is true of adopted children is even more true of customs and culture. I often hear people talk about adopting certain cultural features from the outside over the course of their history. It could be religious customs like the sung litanies or the novena. Or it could be other secular items such as cockfighting or making tortillas in the Spanish oven.
 What we don’t hear as much about is how these strange new customs are adapted as they enter a different culture. Take the Spanish oven, for instance. It might have been introduced by the Spanish in their early years in the islands, but it was made from island materials and was used so as to provide food for the family island-style. Moreover, it was also passed on from mother to daughter, as you would expect in a once-matrilineal society like this.
 Or take the example of the sung litanies to the saints. In early Spanish times, we are told, boys and girls would romp over the hills singing the litanies in harmony for recreation, just as they had once sung bits of their own island lore.
 I’ll never forget the gathering I attended years ago in Yona to celebrate the end of the novena for a deceased member of the family. There I was sipping beer chilled in an ice chest and chatting with other men in the two-car garage of a nice home, while the women were gathered in the living room drinking something a little milder. Just about everything within sight was adopted from abroad, we might say. Yet, there was something distinctively islandish about the gathering. Maybe it was the occasion – the end of the novena. But it could also have been the separation of the men in the garage and the women in the living room. What made it all islandish was the way in which these features had been adapted.
 Generally, the items or practices that are adopted into a culture are also adapted – that is, reshaped so that they fit into the cultural patterns of their new home. Sometimes, they might be plugged into the holes left for normal cultural features, just as the litanies were fit into a slot that boys and girls used to entertain themselves. But these litanies fit into another cultural slot as well when they were sung in church or in the fields to pray for a good harvest. Before litanies were introduced, other prayers to the guardian spirits were employed for that purpose.
 Whether it’s litanies, or ovens, or electric power, or television, or anything else you can think of, never underestimate the ability of a people to reshape what they’re taking in so that it conforms to their own cultural environment. This is what we call adaptation.
 This is not to say that new cultural items will leave the culture entirely undisturbed. It’s easy to see how features from the outside have had a great impact on island society.
 But the change goes both ways. Just as the new feature makes a mark on the society adopting it, so too it is changed by people to suit their own needs. The way in which this happened can be fascinating. I just wish the stories of adaptation were recounted more often.

The US political uncertainty kept the USD bulls on the defensive and assisted gold to gain traction. The uptick lacked any strong follow-through buying and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly. Investors now look forward to the release of the Advance US Q3 GDP report for a fresh impetus. Gold edged higher through the early European session and was last seen hovering near the top end of its daily range, just above the $1880. The precious metal managed to regain some positive traction on Thursday and recovered a part of the previous day's sharp fall to one-month lows amid a subdued US dollar demand. The uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election held the USD bulls from placing aggressive bids, which, in turn, was seen as a key factor lending some support to the dollar- denominated commodity. It is worth reporting that national polls have been indicating that Democrat rival Joe Biden has a lead over Republican incumbent President Donald Trump. Investors, however, remain wary on the back of a narrow gap in certain key swing states. Adding to the uncertainty is the possibility that the outcome being contested, which further drove investors towards the safe-haven yellow metal. Despite the supporting factors, the uptick lacked any strong follow-through amid a solid rebound in the US equity futures. Moreover, the overnight break below 100-day SMA support for the first time since March further warrants some caution for bullish traders. Hence, any subsequent move up might still be seen as a selling opportunity and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly. That said, investors might still prefer to wait on the sidelines ahead of Thursday's key release of the Advance Q3 GDP report. The US economy is expected to have grown by 31% annualized pace during the July-September quarter. Any meaningful divergence from the anticipated figures might infuse some volatility in the financial markets and assist traders to grab some meaningful opportunities.

Fady Abdel-Nour of Prosus and Naspers portfolio likewise offers some interesting potential acquisitions. Within the Prosus website, I find a few of their venture holdings to be quite compelling, including but not limited to: TakeAlot, Udemy, Remitly, Swiggy, Payu, and Creditas. TakeAlot has trailblazed the e-commerce revolution in South Africa and, currently, holds a sizable market share over its nearest competitors. Udemy is one of the largest open e-learning platforms on the planet, boasting over 35 million students and 57,000 instructors teaching in over 65 languages. Remitly is the new-age digital equivalent of Western Union, allowing customers not only to transmit payments wirelessly but also to send payments to one another (across borders) that are available for cash pickup at a number of locations. Swiggy has totally commandeered the food delivery space in India, boasting over 200,000 delivery staff across more than 100 cities, they dominate the marketplace. PayU is an India-based fintech solution that offers businesses (digital and brick/mortar) simple to use and easy to execute payment processing solutions across a plethora of gateways. Lastly, Creditas is South America's largest digital platform for quick and easy secured consumer loans.


  All in all, I think DSAC's advisory board brings a healthy number of exciting potential prospects to inject into the SPAC. Most have some very strong U.S. comparable and many also seem perfectly positioned to realize strong growth tailwinds as a result of shifting dynamics due to the global pandemic.


  ## The Bottom Line


  At the end of the day, regardless of the outcome on November 3, I think there is a high likelihood of a sustained period of uncertainty, and thus volatility, until the future president is sworn into office on January 20. A variety of fund managers I know are holding large cash positions to either A) buy a dip or B) hold out for re-*stabilization (never try to catch a falling knife). On the other hand, I believe if there is an opportunity to put a portion of my cash to good use during that 45-60 day period, why not? SPAC arbitrage gives you the chance to invest in a low risk vehicle that has a limitless (and "free") upside in the form of warrants. In particular, given the oversupply of U.S.-based SPACs, I think DSAC provides a more compelling opportunity given the less competitive geographical landscape and the innate fact that Asia still offers incredible growth metrics (especially in the TMT and fintech spaces). Furthermore, I believe the size of DSAC's offering is not only perfect given Asia's pool of available targets, but it is also perfect for the list of potential companies DSAC's advisors have in their own pipelines, which would result in a most expedient de-SPAC process. I plan to buy DSAC units on the first day of free trading (to ensure it is bought as close to $10), hold through the volatile post-election period, and then sell my common shares and hold my warrants.

Chinese and U.S. military chiefs held talks on crisis communication this week, amid heightened tensions between the two military superpowers this year in the South China Sea, with the United States denying a report on a possible drone attack.


  The exchange, days ahead of the U.S. elections, came as U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper toured Asia with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo where they had urged countries to cooperate with the United States to confront the security threats posed by China, a position China has criticised as a Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset.


  Chinese and U.S. militaries held a video conference meeting about crisis communication on Oct. 28-29, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said on Thursday.


  According to Wu, Esper denied a media report about the United States studying a plan to attack Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea using an MQ-9 drone in the event that the U.S. presidential election was not looking favourable for President Donald Trump.


  Esper said the United States "has no intention of creating a military crisis with the Chinese," according to Wu.


  "We urge the U.S. to walk the talk, keep its promise, and take measures to prevent provoking China military in the air and sea," Wu said, adding that China will resolutely counter-strike if provoked with an attack at sea.


  Both militaries will exchange views via video conferencing on humanitarian aid in mid-November and on maritime security before the end of the year, Wu said.

"With COVID-19 infections rising sharply, the ECB meeting has become much more interesting. This is not because much is expected in terms of actual decisions. In fact, we still think that there is only a chance of some changes to TLTRO-III modalities and tiering multiples. Instead, the meeting will give the ECB an opportunity to take stock of the recent data and COVID-19 news, and possibly offer some guidance about the December meeting when new staff forecasts will be available. We continue to think that the ECB will in December announce an expansion of PEPP by another €500 B and that it will have to follow this up in mid-2021 with another increase of €250 B. The ECB will obviously sound much more concerned about the economy, but there is still a huge amount of uncertainty about the near-term outlook and therefore the ECB may also play for time. The ECB may refrain from sending a very clear signal about December, even if it does suggest that some further support will come. In this context, the meeting will offer ECB policymakers a chance to discuss the fundamental policy strategy, given that there still seems to be a lot of disagreement about Philip Lane's two-step approach to inflation."

This effective ventilation system is further complemented by everyone on board wearing masks. According to researchers, a mask formed a critical part of keeping travelers healthy and credited the role of disinfection and passengers' self-screening for COVID-19 symptoms.Various studies from around the world have proven masks to be effective against further transmission of coronavirus.A study by the US Department of Defense supports the Harvard conclusions. According to its research, the ventilation systems on aircraft are effective enough to filter the air and eliminate the particles that can transmit the virus.However, this study did not consider other ways people could catch the virus, like someone coughing or breathing directly on them, especially in confined spaces such as restrooms.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also noted that &quot;most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on the planes.&quot;However, it also added that the lack of social distancing for prolonged periods might increase passengers' risk of catching the virus.Can it go wrong?On the other hand, Irish found through contract tracing techniques found 13 cases linked to a single passenger on a seven-hour international flight.In that case, the passengers were all wearing masks and sitting with a gap of five seats between them.Researchers attributed the reason for this spread to the passengers who were infected before they boarded the flights. One of the passengers in that flight had contracted the virus from a family member, while two others spent multi-hour layovers in the airport lounges.In another case, a woman had removed mask only during her time in the restroom, and she was later tested positive.To avoid such cases, Harvard University suggested the travelers minimize the time they spend without wearing masks. At the same time, they are focusing their attention on the parts of the travel experience where there is no ventilation system, such as airport lounges and security lines.Airports are looking at measures to avoid transmission through these touchpoints as well. There is an increased focus on sanitizing the aircraft after every trip and then again at the end of the day.

In the aftermath of Biden’s remarks on debate night, 52 percent of independent voters are in favor of phasing out oil in the long run, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll. Even among Republican voters, 41 percent said yes. And when all voters were asked which candidate is trusted to tackle climate change, Biden beat Trump by 30 points (59-29).
 Those stats are in sync with what the Pew Research Center found in June: “A broad majority of Americans (79 percent) say the more important priority for the country is to develop alternative sources, such as wind and solar; far fewer (20 percent) say the more important energy priority is to expand the production of oil, coal and natural gas. Views on this question are about the same as they were in October 2019.”
 In the stretch drive to election day, Trump will crank up the hyperbole (Sleepy Joe will destroy the oil industry!), particularly in fossil fuel- producing states like Texas and Pennsylvania, in the hopes of scaring a pivotal share of people to vote red. Granted, he may sway some (and a few Democratic congressional candidates in oil-producing states have tiptoed away from Biden’s debate remarks). But other voters — particularly young people — may be more energized by Biden’s stated determination to combat climate change.
 And, lest we forget, Trump has virtually no credibility outside his cult to score with any of his lies. Marinating in his climate change denial, he’s still ranting nonsense about wind turbines “killing all the birds,” and about how Biden supposedly would “knock down buildings and build buildings with little tiny small windows” — a twisted reference to Biden’s plan to retrofit buildings and make them more energy efficient.
 One other thing. Trump owns the most deadly pandemic of the last 100 years — with new record highs in America — yet he’s still telling voters that we’re “rounding the corner.”
 Nothing in climate policy that Biden foresees for 2050 can possibly trump the illness, joblessness, and death that the demagogue is sowing in 2020.

Being a $175mm SPAC based out of Hong Kong, DSAC also presents significant upside solely with regards to its geography and cleverly sized offering. If you've spent much time investing in Asia, you are aware that while Asian markets present more significant upside growth potential (when compared to their American and European counterparts), this largely comes from the fact that they are still developmentally less mature and thus do not have as many private market companies valued over a billion USD. As a seasoned SPAC investor, the general rule of thumb is that a SPAC's ideal target company's enterprise value (EV) should fall between 3x and 5x of the total funds raised (in this case $175mm). Therefore, this puts DSAC's ideal target company's EV between $500mm and $1bn (I've dubbed this EV segment 'pre-unicorns'). Given DSAC's geography and management experience, I find it less likely that this raise was an arbitrary selection and more likely an intelligible, albeit calculated, decision - not too large, not too small, but just right (Goldilocks approves).


  Last, but certainly not least, I find DSAC's advisory board and directors to perfectly compliment the sponsor management team. As I described earlier, while sponsor teams are most often led by Private Equity and Venture Capital types, this is not always the best fit. Naturally, however, these groups of investors do have great deal flow and are always looking for alternative routes to exit their portfolio companies. Unfortunately, all too often, they lack the true public market experience to select a public-market ready target company and ensure a properly optimized initial entry of said company into such markets. That is why I find DSAC's fusion so promising; they have a hedge-fund led sponsor team and an advisory board comprised of seasoned Asia Private Equity and Venture Capitalists. With this breakdown, you get the best of both worlds, Goldilocks approve once again. The Private Equity and Venture Capitalist led advisory board are able to supply a limitless deal flow to the sponsor team who can then properly assess which of these private companies is most public-market ready and shows greatest potential for re-rating and optimizing said companies' foray into the public market.

The demand for sulfuric acid is skyrocketing across the globe, mainly due to the soaring demand for sulfur-based fertilizers. Sulfuric acid is extensively used in the waste water treatment and oil & gas industry, which is likely to trigger the demand from the global sulfuric acid market size. Sulfuric acid is extensively used to manufacture fertilizers and chemicals and is used in metal processing. This is anticipated to accelerate the market growth across the globe. It is highly used as a catalyst, dehydrating agent, and reactant by the automotive sector. The increasing demand for excellent food quality and high crop yield from the agricultural industry are further anticipated to stimulate the market in the long run. Sulfuric acid is also used in automotive batteries, which is likely to act as a primary growth stimulant for the market.

Luigi de Magistris ha inviato oggi una lettera a Nunzia Catalfo, ministra del Lavoro e delle Politiche Sociali e a Giuseppe Provenzano ministro per il Sud e la Coesione Territoriale sulla delicata tematica del lavoro.   “Sono molto numerose - così inizia la missiva - le richieste e le sollecitazioni da parte di cittadini, associazioni, organizzazioni sindacali, gruppi e movimenti che, quotidianamente, vengono rivolte al Sindaco di Napoli, richiedenti servizi e misure dedicate al lavoro. La pandemia da Covid 19 oltre ad aver indebolito il sistema produttivo locale, ha anche provocato una grave crisi del sistema di coesione sociale del nostro territorio e della nostra comunità.”   Il primo cittadino prosegue sottolineando che “da diversi anni, l'Amministrazione Comunale di Napoli ha avviato una importante riflessione sul ruolo dei Comuni nella filiera integrata dei servizi Lavoro, Welfare, Sviluppo, che riveste una significativa e rilevante funzione economica e sociale di garanzia e di tutela dei diritti fondamentali delle persone.   Per tali motivi, accogliamo, sempre, con estrema responsabilità le richieste di incontro e registriamo, in queste periodo, maggiori domande che arrivano da gruppi di persone senza lavoro che - in forma più o meno organizzata - manifestano un disagio sociale che deve, sempre, essere ascoltato. Nelle scorse settimane, abbiamo tenuto diversi incontri con i disoccupati, i precari, gli espulsi dal sistema produttivo, i riders, gli operai di Whirlpool e di Hexyss, tutti finalizzati, non solo a condividere il senso di comune e civica solidarietà, ma con la responsabilità - insieme alle altre Istituzioni - di fornire risposte celeri ed adeguate”.   La lettera del sindaco de Magistris così si conclude: “Occorre ed è necessario un confronto teso a favorire la ripresa e il rilancio dei tessuti produttivi locali, attraverso il lavoro. La Città di Napoli e quella Metropolitana, di cui sono, di entrambe, il Sindaco, stanno facendo la loro parte, ma, ripeto, è indispensabile la cooperazione e la condivisione degli intenti che si può realizzare, solo, con un sereno confronto con il Governo Nazionale. Deve essere portato a termine ogni sforzo ed essere utilizzata ogni risorsa per impedire il tracollo del mercato del lavoro, con ricadute preoccupanti - come vediamo in questi giorni - sulla coesione civile e sociale del Paese. A tal proposito, chiedo, con cortese urgenza, un incontro per avviare quel confronto - a cui accennavo in precedenza - sul tema del lavoro a Napoli e nel Mezzogiorno”.

The same goes for Turtle Beach’s performance-minded audio mode, Superhuman Hearing. When paired with surround sound, it emphasizes gameplay-relevant tones, like footsteps, over general gameplay sound. Strangely, it also raises the volume across the board, so everything is very loud. It technically works – the “right” sounds come through more clearly than the rest – but the difference isn’t as significant as I’ve experienced in similar modes from other headsets. More importantly in my mind, the listening experience isn’t as pleasant with Superhuman Hearing on. The volume is too high, and sudden noises pop too aggressively.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Hurricane Zeta, which has been increasing in intensity and speed all day, is making landfall in southeast Louisiana as a Category 2 storm with 110 mph winds, according to the 5 p.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center.


  Zeta, which is traveling at a brisk 24 mph, is almost a Category 3 hurricane, which is considered a major hurricane. A Category 3 hurricane has winds between 111 and 129 mph. Zeta was 1 mph from becoming the fifth major hurricane of the year joining Laura, Teddy, Delta and Epsilon.


  Zeta made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, according to the NHC.


  Zeta became the record-breaking 11th named storm to make a U.S. landfall during the 2020 hurricane season, nearly all of them along the storm-ravaged Gulf coast.


  But Zeta's landfall strength wasn't predicted. Tuesday's forecast called for Zeta to make landfall at or near Category 1 status, which means winds between 74 and 95 mph.


  Zeta surprisingly underwent rapid intensification, which is defined as a wind increase of at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.


  The storm was a Category 1 hurricane when it made landfall in Mexico overnight Monday, but it dropped to a tropical storm after interacting with land.


  Zeta was located 65 miles south-southwest of New Orleans at Wednesday's 5 p.m. advisory. Hurricane-force winds extended 35 miles from the storm's center and tropical-storm-force winds extended 150 miles from center.


  This marks the seventh time New Orleans has been in the hurricane center's storm cone this year, according to The Weather Channel.


  "On the forecast track, the center of Zeta will make a second landfall along the Mississippi coast this evening," the NHC said, "and then move across the southeastern and eastern United States on Thursday."


  Zeta is expected to cause problems throughout the south and over to the East Coast.


  "A few tornadoes are expected this afternoon through tonight over southeastern parts of Louisiana and Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the western Panhandle of Florida," forecasters said Wednesday.


  Parts of the Panhandle could see storm surge of 1 to 4 feet, while areas outside Florida are in a forecast range of 1 to 9 feet.


  A state of emergency was declared Tuesday for Alabama and Louisiana ahead of the storm's arrival.


  The NHC said heavy rainfall, both in advance of and along the track of Zeta, is expected from the central Gulf Coast to the mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. The rainfall ventures into the southern to central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic Wednesday and Thursday.


  The NHC also said damaging winds, especially in gusts, will spread well inland across portions of southeastern Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia from Wednesday evening through early Thursday morning.


  Damaging winds are expected to go into the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia on Thursday. It said wind gusts could be especially severe across the southern Appalachian Mountains on Thursday.


  Zeta is predicted to eventually mix with the winter storm that's gripping the southern portion of the United States.


  "They'll be a little bit harder to tell apart by, say, Thursday or Friday," said Jonathan Belles, IBM meteorologist for Weather.com. "They'll basically become one big mass of rainfall as it moves into the mid- Atlantic and northeast."


  New Jersey could experience wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, according to Bob Smerbeck, senior meteorologist for AccuWeather.


  Although Hurricane Zeta traveled along a similar path as Hurricane Delta, it wasn't a candidate to undergo rapid intensification such as Delta.


  It's late in the hurricane season so the water is a bit cooler. In general, the water in the Gulf of Mexico is at its warmest in September. Plus, the jet stream has dipped farther south, providing more wind shear.


  Zeta proved all of that irrelevant.


  Interestingly, Zeta hit the only spot along the Gulf coast where cooler waters exist.


  "They're above average along the Texas coast and above average near the Florida coast," Smerbeck said, "but split right in between it's kind of average temperatures."


  Previous storms might be responsible for the average water temperatures because as they've come through Louisiana, they've brought up cooler water from lower in the ocean.


  Zeta also proved that to be largely irrelevant.


  Worse, Louisiana might not be in the safe zone yet because there could be more tropical activity as soon as next week.


  Meteorologists also are eyeing a system that could form in the southwest Caribbean.


  "This is exactly what we look for this time of year on the tail end of these colds fronts, they get down into the Gulf or the southwest Atlantic, the Bahamas and Cuba and places like that," Smerbeck said. "We are concerned next week there's going to be some potential for a tropical system to develop."


  Right now, it's too early to make a firm prediction but forecasters are paying attention.


  "Whether something would actually try to come up out of the Caribbean up into the United States, that I have no idea," Smerbeck said, "but there is potential for another tropical system in the northwest Caribbean or even into the Bay of Campeche perhaps into the southwest Gulf, that general area, and maybe east of the Bahamas."


  Zeta formed as a tropical storm in the predawn hours Sunday south of western Cuba, only the second time in history a hurricane season has produced 27 named storms.


  The only other storm named Zeta was in 2005, when a system developed on Dec. 30, a month after the official end of hurricane season, and lingered into the first week of 2006.


  If there is record-breaking next named storm, it would be assigned Eta from the Greek alphabet.


  Although both 2005 and 2020 had 27 named storms, a reanalysis of the 2005 season revealed a 28th system briefly became a subtropical storm far in the Atlantic on Oct. 4, 2005. That former unnamed storm is now called the "Azores sub-tropical storm," according to AccuWeather. Because of it, 2005 technically still holds the title of busiest hurricane season on record – for now.


  Even with five weeks to go, the 2020 hurricane season, a La Nina year that spawned four major hurricanes has been memorable for many reasons.


  A record 24 storms were the earliest of previous seasons to be given their names.


  A record 11 named storms have made landfall in the continental U.S. – Bertha, Cristobal, Fay, Hanna, Isaias, Laura, Marco, Sally, Beta, Delta and Zeta. The previous mark was nine storms in 1916, according to hurricane specialist Dr. Philip Klotzbach of Colorado State University.


  Never before has a hurricane named after a letter in the Greek alphabet made landfall in the continental U.S. This year, three hurricanes did just that: Beta hit just northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, on Sept. 22, Delta struck southwest Louisiana on Oct. 10, and Zeta hit southeast Louisiana.


  Hurricane Delta became the strongest storm ever named after a letter in the Greek alphabet and became the fastest storm on record to intensify from a tropical depression to Category 4 hurricane.


  Tropical Storms Arthur and Bertha formed before the June 1 start of hurricane season, marking only the second time in recorded history two storms have formed before the season began.


  September was especially noteworthy, producing 10 named storms – a record for that month. The previous record for September was eight named storms in 2002, 2007 and 2010.


  On Sept. 14, there were five tropical cyclones spinning at the same time, one away from the record established Sept. 11-12, 1971, according to Klotzbach. The Sept. 14 frenzy had Tropical Storms Paulette, Rene, Sally and Teddy as well as Tropical Depression 21, marking just the second time the Atlantic basin has had five or more storms at once.


  Four days later, on Sept. 18, a record-tying three named storms formed in a six-hour span – Tropical Storm Wilfred (Eastern Atlantic), Subtropical Storm Alpha (near Portugal) and Tropical Storm Beta (Gulf of Mexico). The only other day to have three storms form was more than 100 years ago, on Aug. 15, 1893, according to Klotzbach.


  October also has been active with four named storms (Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Zeta). The last time there were four or more named storms in October was 2005, when that month had six named storms, as well as that unnamed subtropical storm.


  The 2020 hurricane season was predicted to be above normal by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in May, but updated in August to extremely active.


  While Florida south of the Panhandle escaped virtually unscathed in 2020, Louisiana was brutalized by five named storms – Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta, and Tropical Storms Cristobal and Marco.

I’ll take a bath, make a hearty meal, read a book, watch a show or film — whatever I’m feeling called to do that’s somewhat mindless yet nourishing. Once I’ve allowed the space simply to chill, my energy recalibrates and I can then handle my tasks with clarity and excitement.”

If the "default" iPhone isn't your cup of tea, the new 12 Mini should appeal to those looking for the same power, but in a smaller device.

GREENSBORO, N.C. — More folks from North Carolina are standing up for their beliefs in this election.   After 13 days of early voting in 2016, about 2.1 million had cast their ballot either in person or by mail. In the same amount of time this year, 3.6 million people already voted.      But political scientists say using the surge in early voting to predict a winner, is like trying to read between the lines. It can get messy.      You could look at what party they are registered to: 39 percent are Democrats, 30 percent are Republicans and 30 percent are unaffiliated. So it may seem like Democrats have an advantage except that falls in line pretty much with how many people are registered to those parties in our state. And remember in 2016, there were more registered Democrats but Donald Trump still won North Carolina.      Plus there's a poll from ABC News/Washington Post which showed that the majority of people who planned to early vote supported Joe Biden but among those who wanted to wait until election day more picked Donald Trump.      This happened back in 2016 too. Records show Hilary Clinton won 51 percent of the early vote in our state, but only 41 percent on election day.

Airbus said on Thursday it expected to stop burning cash in the fourth quarter, giving investors the first glimpse of a path out of the coronavirus crisis after speeding up deliveries to cash-strapped airlines.The European planemaker said the first formal target since it halted annual guidance in April remained intact after France announced a new nationwide lockdown overnight.Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said Airbus had learned much about how to adapt during the seven-month-old crisis.But he also cautioned that airline traffic was taking longer than expected to recover from the dramatic hit seen at the start of the pandemic when airlines were forced to ground fleets.&quot;We believe we will have to live with the circulation of the virus for a long period of time,&quot; Faury said.Airbus shares fluctuated as concerns about the pandemic vied for attention alongside upbeat cash guidance and better-than-expected core operating profit, which excluded a 1.2 billion euro restructuring charge.Underlying third-quarter operating profit fell 49% to 820 million euros as revenue fell 27 percent to 11.2 billion, beating market forecasts on profit but falling short on revenue.Addressing concerns of investors across the aerospace industry, the focus of the quarterly update was on efforts to preserve cash, which depend heavily on aircraft deliveries.Airbus reduced an overhang of 145 aircraft that it had been unable to deliver during the crisis by 10 units to 135 jets.It has shored up deliveries partly by striking storage agreements with airlines unable to put jets directly into service. But some industry sources said a new lockdown in France raised new questions about its ability to deliver jets smoothly.Some airlines have already privately expressed reluctance to send staff to Europe to take delivery, though Airbus said it expected deliveries to stay broadly in line with production.It did not reintroduce delivery targets, but people tracking the schedule say it appears to be aiming for anywhere between 500 and 550 handovers in 2020, down from 863 in 2019.Production hikeFaury defended plans to ask suppliers to support a hike in monthly output of the A320neo family to 47 from 40 in third-quarter 2021 if demand permits. Such medium-haul jets are expected to lead the industry out of its worst crisis.Confirming a Reuters report, Faury said those plans already reflected the more tepid recovery because they had been delayed by three months from a previous, unannounced plan.But suppliers worry in case Airbus is unable to meet the new goal, leaving them with bills for investing in new capacity.&quot;Suppliers will draw their own conclusions,&quot; said one source involved in efforts to boost the fragile sector.With long-distance travel still hampered by border restrictions and weak business confidence, Faury said output of bigger aircraft like the A350 would not go up any time soon.Some analysts expect Airbus to cut wide-body rates again after halving A350 output to five a month. Insiders say Airbus has already dabbed the brakes to bring output to 4.5 a month.Airbus also shed more light on a recent bid to smooth a long-running trade row with Boeing and the United States over aircraft subsidies by resetting the terms of French and Spanish government loans, saying this had cost 236 million euros.The loans have been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization, leading to U.S. tariffs on European goods.The European Union this week won the right to put its own tariffs on U.S. goods over Boeing subsidies that the WTO has also ruled illegal. Both sides claim to have cancelled any past illegal support and are sparring over a possible settlement.Airbus is meanwhile steeling itself for an acrimonious divorce between Britain and the European Union as trade talks go down to the wire.Faury said Airbus had reactivated planning for a worst-case no-deal Brexit, though he did not expect this to be needed.It builds wings for virtually all its jets in Britain, where it employs 14,000 people. Its other main plants are in France, Germany and Spain, with outposts in China and the United States.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A fraternity at the University of Michigan is being sued by its national organization after accepting women as members. A federal judge is holding a hearing Thursday about whether to ease an Oct. 23 order that bars Michigan Sigma Phi from using the national fraternity's name and Greek letters. Since 2016, Michigan Sigma Phi has accepted dozens of members who aren't men or who are nonbinary, a gender identity that is not strictly male or female, said Stephanie Stoneback, a graduate who was president in 2017-18. \"It did feel sort of like we were pioneering something,” Stoneback told The Detroit News. “But honestly, it really just felt like I was joining a group of friends.” Sigma Phi Society, the New York- based national organization, said membership decisions in Ann Arbor are harming the group and its trademarks, according to its lawsuit in federal court in Detroit. “In a nutshell, defendants want to continue to operate as a Sigma Phi chapter, identify as a Sigma Phi chapter, and use the trademarks — without following the rules. Respectfully, defendants cannot have it both ways,\" the lawsuit states. Michigan Sigma Phi was struggling to find people to live in the fraternity house when it decided to expand membership. “These are progressive University of Michigan fraternity members,” said David Nacht, a lawyer for Michigan Sigma Phi. “That is not a phrase you hear often. These are people who are standing up for civil rights, inclusion and gender equality. And we just want to give them a right to do so and have a voice.”

FOR about six months, David Rodney Werner headed to the Quart Pot River in Stanthorpe with his fishing gear in hand, but the only catch he had on the line was the town’s meth addicts.
 The Toowoomba Supreme Court heard the 38-year-old man trafficked in meth from November 28, 2017 to June 12, 2018, making $1500 each day.
 The court heard he did so while disguised as a fisherman, selling between “a point” to bags containing of 3.5 grams.
 Police raided Werner’s home on December 22, 2017 and recovered 1.7 grams of meth, drug utensils, cash and a taser concealed as a mobile.
 Despite the police attention, Werner continued his trade.
 On May 21, 2018, police searched a vehicle he was sitting in and found a fishing bag that contained fishing equipment, a large-bladed knife, a tomahawk, 10.63 grams of pure meth, two mobile phones, $6525 in cash, a glass pipe and nine shotgun shells.
 Werner was arrested and held in custody for 221 days before he was again granted bail.
 However, the court heard he continued his illicit trade from behind bars, arranging for an associate to collect thousands of dollars’ worth of drug debts.
 “I understand that the reason you continued … to pursue payment of debts is that you yourself were indebted to your suppliers,” Justice Martin Burns said.
 “Your trafficking, although at a street-level, was sustained, persistent and profitable.”
 For the defence, barrister David Jones told the court Werner had a long history of mental illness and battled alcohol addiction.
 He added that Werner was only introduced to meth in 2017, after he lost his job as a demolitions contractor.
 Werner pleaded guilty to trafficking in methylamphetamine in a quantity exceeding two grams, burglary, common assault, attempting to pervert the course of justice, unlawful possession of a category R weapon, possess explosives and seven lesser drug offences.
 Judge Burns ordered a head sentence of six years in jail for the trafficking charge.
 Noting Werner’s lengthy pre-sentence custody, Judge Burns set Werner’s parole eligibility date at May 19, 2021.

QUINCY — Since contact days were first allowed by the Illinois High School Association in September, the Quincy High School boys basketball team has been meeting three times per week in Blue Devil Gym without a single coronavirus- related issue.


  The Blue Devils will meet again Thursday.


  Masked up. Socially distant. Curious what the future holds.


  “We’ll be following guidelines,” QHS coach Andy Douglas said. “And we’ll be answering questions they have.”


  The answers at this moment likely will be fuzzy.


  Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reclassified basketball as a high-risk sport and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during his daily briefing the winter sports season was being put “on hold.”


  Wednesday, the Illinois High School Association Board of Directors decided to defy the Governor’s orders and move forward with basketball season, releasing a statement explaining the decision and stance. But in the same statement, the board placed the ultimate onus on the schools themselves.


  “We will require all IHSA basketball teams to adhere to those (IHSA Sports Medicine Advisory Committee) mitigations and allow local school officials to make decisions related to participation,” the board’s statement read.


  That leads to possibly the biggest question of all: Will superintendents or school boards defy the state government and willingly accept any ramifications that come with it?


  The Illinois State Board of Education suggests they shouldn’t.


  In a letter sent to principals and superintendents Wednesday night, State Superintendent of Education Dr. Carmen Ayala wrote, “Defying the state’s public health guidance opens schools up to liability and other ramifications that may negatively impact school communities.”


  That would mean shutting the door on basketball season, something many administrators don’t want to do.


  “I think we should let the kids have a chance,” Quincy Notre Dame athletic director Bill Connell said. “If it doesn’t work out, then we can always say later that it’s not working or it’s not working at these two schools or it’s not working anywhere in the state.


  “To completely say at this point we’re flat out not going to play, I guess it’s kind of mind-boggling. I understand we need to be safe 100 percent. But don’t you want to go off some facts and not some things that might happen? Right now we’re going off a lot of mights.”


  That might not be good enough for kids who are seeking some sort of normalcy in their lives.


  “There’s nothing we can do right now that would affect the decisions being made above us,” Pittsfield boys basketball coach Brad Tomhave said. “You feel kind of lost at times. The one thing we can do and that the kids need and people need is a sense of normalcy.


  “The most important thing is to create an environment for those kids that is as normal as possible.”


  There’s nothing normal about looming litigation.


  The IHSA, ISBE and schools across the state are preparing for such a possibility.


  “The legal question remains in the unknown,” IHSA executive director Craig Anderson said. “I didn’t resource any of our legal counsel related to this. Honestly, when we went into the meeting, I was unsure of where our board was going to go with their decision making. Based upon (Illinois Deputy Governor) Jesse Ruiz’s response there could be ramifications, I shared that with our board.


  “The board thought those are going to have to be decisions that our local districts will determine if it warrants moving forward. ... At some point over the next month or whatever time frame, we will figure out if this is a legal issue for us as an association or if it is for our schools and we’ll have to pivot as we’ve been pivoting a number of times throughout this school year and beyond.”


  At some point, pivot fails to produce the right kind of opportunities students deserve.


  “I don’t know how many more times we can start over,” Connell said.

For years, the tradition always was that regular-season high-school football was reserved for Friday nights. Maybe an occasional Thursday game, such as the last week of the regular season if there was no school the next day.
 Of course, you have some places, such as Norfolk, O’Neill and Hartington, where multiple schools share the same field, and if both teams are scheduled for a home game, there’s no way both can play at the same time. So it’s understandable to perhaps have Thursday night games in those instances.
 In recent years, Friday afternoon games have become more prevalent — most of which is caused by a shortage of game officials. After all, you can’t have an official game without referees and umpires and linesmen to make sure the rules are enforced.
 All of this has come to a head this year for Lutheran High Northeast.
 The only Friday night home game for Lutheran High was in Week 2 against West Holt, its home opener. Since a Sept. 11 game at Beemer against Guardian Angels Central Catholic, the Eagles have played only one Friday night game — a trip to Plainview on Oct. 9.
 Of their four regular-season home games, the Eagles played Wakefield on a Saturday afternoon, Hartington-Newcastle on a Thursday night and Laurel- Concord-Coleridge on a Thursday night in the regular-season finale. There was also a game at Elkhorn Valley that was played on a Friday afternoon in Tilden.
 It’s a collaborative effort between the activities directors in the three high schools — Ben Ries at Norfolk High, Jeff Bellar at Norfolk Catholic and Darin Suckstorf at Lutheran High Northeast — to determine who gets what games when.

Willis has been managing the injury since last season, but the busy fixture schedule at this stage of the campaign takes its toll and he was also given an injection to ease the problem around 12 months ago.
 "Jordan has had a problem with his patella tendon ever since he has been here," said Parkinson.
 "Last year we got to the stage where he had an injection in it.
 "He had a scan yesterday and we are assessing whether we are at the stage now where he has the boost of an injection, is that the right thing to do at this point.
 "I need to sit down with him and the doctor and the physio to make that decision.
 "It's something he can get on with, but as the games have come thick and fast there are certain days when he does find it uncomfortable.
 "Patella tendon injuries are a problem because it's one of those things you just have to manage.
 "There are treatments and injections you can have to help, but you can only have so many of those injection into one tendon so you have to be careful.
 "We will be guided by the medical team on that."
 On-loan Wolves defender Dion Sanderson made his debut at Rochdale but he also picked up a knock, although he completed the 90 minutes and is not regarded as a major doubt going into this weekend's game at Gillingham.

Chinese and U.S. military chiefs held talks on crisis communication this week, amid heightened tensions between the two military superpowers this year in the South China Sea, with the United States denying a report on a possible drone attack.The exchange, days ahead of the U.S. elections, came as U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper toured Asia with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo where they had urged countries to cooperate with the United States to confront the security threats posed by China, a position China has criticised as a Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset.Chinese and U.S. militaries held a video conference meeting about crisis communication on Oct. 28-29, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said on Thursday.According to Wu, Esper denied a media report about the United States studying a plan to attack Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea using an MQ-9 drone in the event that the U.S. presidential election was not looking favourable for President Donald Trump.Esper said the United States &quot;has no intention of creating a military crisis with the Chinese,&quot; according to Wu.&quot;We urge the U.S. to walk the talk, keep its promise, and take measures to prevent provoking China military in the air and sea,&quot; Wu said, adding that China will resolutely counter-strike if provoked with an attack at sea.Both militaries will exchange views via video conferencing on humanitarian aid in mid-November and on maritime security before the end of the year, Wu said.

Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy is sticking with quarterback Nick Foles over Mitchell Trubisky and intends to keep calling plays on offense at least for now.
   
 He made that clear Tuesday, a day after an ugly 24-10 loss to the Rams. The Bears' poor performance at Los Angeles added more fuel to the idea that their sparkling record was more of a mirage than a reflection of how good they are.
   
 But if changes are coming, there won't be one behind center.
   
 "We have a lot of confidence and I have a lot of confidence in Nick right now with where he's at," he said. "Again, this is a process for us to work though, and it's not just one person. It's really not."
   
 The Bears (5-2) fell out of the NFC North lead with their first road loss. And their quarterback had a difficult time with the offensive line getting overwhelmed.
   
 Foles completed 28 of 40 passes for 261 yards without a touchdown. He was sacked four times -- twice by former Bears linebacker Leonard Floyd -- and threw two interceptions.
   
 Too often, Foles was unable to step into his throws with defenders bearing down on him. But Nagy dismissed the idea of going back to the more mobile Trubisky, who started the first three games before getting benched.
   
 "In regards to a mobile quarterback, I'm not so sure that that's the answer with that, with what we're talking about, with the drop-back of a quarterback and the tackle situation," Nagy said.
   
 The Bears are averaging a league-low 84.1 yards rushing, and rank 29th in total yards per game and 27th in scoring (19.7 points).
   
 Clearly, they have a wide range of issues. When it comes to who's calling plays, Nagy is open to handing off those duties. But for now, he is staying the course.
   
 "Right now, where we're at, that's not where we think it's at," Nagy said. "But at the same point in time, I'll always continue each week to look at it. I'll say this, too. When you're in a little bit of a rut like we are, a lot of bit of a rut like we are right now, you have to look at everything."
   
 By no means was it a great night, with the Bears allowing a season-high 161 yards rushing and 371 yards in all. But the defense produced Chicago's lone touchdown, when Eddie Jackson returned a fumble 8 yards in the fourth quarter.
   
 The line continues to be a big issue for the Bears. And they don't appear to have any real solutions on the bench. Unless they bring in outside help, any improvement will have to come from within.
   
 TE Cole Kmet. The second-round draft pick from Notre Dame is playing his way into a bigger role. He caught a touchdown in the win at Carolina last week, and he had a neat grab on Monday night. With Foles throwing across his body, Kmet turned, leaped and hauled in a 38-yard pass over Justin Hollins along the left sideline.
   
 "He's making plays," Nagy said. "There's a trust element there I think you're starting to really see and it's growing, and when you have a ball thrown your way when you're absolutely covered and you make a play, that's neat to see."
   
 PR Ted Ginn Jr. The 35-year-old Ginn simply hasn't been the steady hand the Bears needed once Tarik Cohen tore his ACL in Chicago's win at Atlanta in Week 3. Against the Rams, he looked helpless. Ginn did not run one back as Johnny Hekker buried the Bears inside the 10 on all five of his punts. He has five returns for 24 yards since Cohen went down. And with just three receptions for 40 yards, he's not giving the Bears much on offense, either.
   
 Center Cody Whitehair injured his calf in the second half, though Nagy said after the game he thought Whitehair was OK.

Looking at the quarterly data alone, GDP grew 7.4% from the second to the third quarter, compared with a 9% decline between the first and second quarter.
 The rapid growth reflects the restarting of the economy after the spring lockdown, but America is not out of the woods yet. Even though the third quarter's annualized growth rate was a larger number than the decline in the second quarter, it doesn't mean the economy has fully bounced back.
 The drop between April and June was so severe that even though the third quarter increase is enormous, it's starting from a much lower base. Comparing the size of the economy in the third quarter to the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of last year hammers this home: The economy is still about 3.5% smaller.
 The National Bureau of Economic Research said the pandemic recession started in February, defined as the period between the peak of economic activity and its nadir. Whether the recession is officially behind us isn't clear yet. If it is, it would have been much shorter than the average downturn.
 But economists worry that the econom is slowing down again in the final three months of the year. Meanwhile, Covid-19 infections are spiking again and worries about renewed lockdown restrictions that could deepen the pandemic recession. In Europe, rising infection rates have already led to tighter rules.
 Millions of people are still unemployed and rely on government benefits to make ends meet. As of September, the US labor market was still down 10.7 million jobs compared with pre-pandemic times.

It was like 15 or 20 years ago, I think. This woman was driving home along a country highway with dark woods on either side that were eerily lit now by a forest fire high up in the mountains that had been burning for several days. And there was a car behind her, the only other car on the road. And then, suddenly, the car flicked on its high beams. The woman was a little confused by this because he was much closer than he should have been to her, anyway (she'd actually thought he was getting ready to pass her), and so she slowed down thinking he wanted to get by. He slowed down, too, but didn't pass. Then he turned his high beams off. Then he turned them on again, then off. Then again. Then again.      Well, by now she was getting very scared. There had been a recent rash of gang attacks in the area where gang members would drive around deliberately at night with their headlights turned off, just waiting for someone to flick their high beams at them as a reminder. Anyone who dead got shot dead in a drive-by. So she was worried that this might be some new twist on that even though the gang had supposedly moved on. So she started driving faster and faster to get away, but the car behind her just kept up with her. And kept flicking its high beams. And then she remembered also that there had been a news flash earlier about a murderer escaping from the local prison -- he had murdered his entire family with a meat hook. And so she started fearing that this person following her might be him, and started driving even faster. Still, the car kept up. And then she remembered that as a child she had heard stories about a terrible man who haunted these very woods -- a very tall and thin man with no face and a black suit who would stalk and abduct children. And at that thought she drove even faster, recklessly now, crying as she tried to get away. But the car kept up. And she was still looking at it in her rearview mirror when something large and black suddenly fell from the sky and crashed through her windshield. She screamed, losing control as her car veered sideways, sailing over an embankment to crash into a gully below.      She thought she was dead, of course. But she survived. She lost consciousness for a moment, but when she came to she was wedged in the front seat, trapped by her seatbelt. Her car was upside down. And she could hear footsteps coming, cracking their way through the branches and leaves. Approaching her. Frantically, she struggled to get free but she could not -- she could only hang there, her terror mounting as the steady footsteps drew closer and closer. Finally, a man's bearded face appeared in her window. His hand clutched a knife. She opened her mouth and screamed, her piercing cry filling the air.      "I'm not going to hurt you," the man said. He bent forward with the knife and she screamed again.      "I'm here to help you," the man said. "Hold still and I'll cut you free."      She screamed again, but then fell silent as the man leaned in the window and began to saw at her seatbelt with his knife. "There was someone in your back seat," he said. "He was hiding. He kept poking his head up and I could see a hook in his hand, a meat hook." With one final stroke of the knife, the seatbelt came free. The man sheathed his knife and pulled her from the car. "He was going to kill you. But every time I turned on my high beams, he ducked down again. Look, there." He pointed to the back seat, and the woman saw a man's limp and bloody arm dangling from the window, a wickedly curved meat hook still clutched in his grip.      "Oh my God," the woman sobbed. "But...but...something hit me. Something from the sky."      The man nodded. He turned and pointed to the windshield, where another man's body was wedged into the nearly-shattered glass. He was dressed all in black, with webbed feet, and it took the woman a moment to realize he was wearing a wetsuit. "Who...who is he?" she stammered.      The man shook his head. "A diver. I'm guessing he was diving in the lake when one of the helicopters scooped him in its water bucket. He fell when they started their drop. What a terrible way to go."      "Oh my God," the woman said again. And suddenly everything that had happened to her overwhelmed her in a rush, and she sobbed and pressed herself against the man, and then they were kissing each other passionately, and they fell together on the ground in a carnal and hungry embrace as the smoke swirled around them and the forest crackled and burned.      When it was over, the man waited while she dressed and then helped her climb back to the road. "I'm going to drive and get help," he told her. "You wait here in case someone stops by. It won't be long." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box. "Here, I want you to have this."      "What is it?" she asked.      "Open it when I'm gone," he said.      So she nodded. And the man got in his car and drove away. She watched as his taillights vanished into the hazy air, then looked at the box in her hand. She turned its small latch and pulled it open. Inside was a folded piece of paper. She took it out and opened it. On it were written six words: Welcome to the world of AIDS.      I don't know what happened to her. Poor woman.

Charlotte tight end Bryson Nesbit (6-foot-6, 220 pounds) has been idle this fall as far as practicing and playing football games. He has been working out, and he will play football for South Mecklenburg this winter and spring, but he has been practicing basketball and preparing for that season. His football recruiting has slowed since he named his top five of South Carolina, North Carolina, UCLA, Ole Miss and Virginia Tech, and he's not able to take any unofficial or official visits. He said he is in regular contact with all five schools and two in particular seem to be coming at him harder than the rest.
 "I'd say right now UCLA and UNC are pushing the hardest," Nesbit said. "I haven't been able to take a football visit out to UCLA yet, but I've been on campus before for basketball. UNC, I've been on campus multiple times. The Tar Heels are definitely on an up trend. Recently they've been trying to do more with the tight end. I see they are trying to do more, it's just a matter of personnel for them."
 The Gamecocks are making regular contacts with Nesbit who is the son of former Gamecock star offensive lineman Jamar Nesbit. But he's so familiar with the Gamecocks, the program and the campus, there's not much more for the Gamecock coaches to sell him on.
 "Nothing much as really changed especially since I've been to the campus so many times," Nesbit said. "I've really seen everything they have to offer except for the official visit. We're kind of at a standstill there, but I still have constant contact with coach (Bobby) Bentley, coach (Will) Muschamp and coach (Joe) Cox."
 He has, of course, watched the Gamecocks closely this season, in particular, how new offensive coordinator Mike Bobo has engaged the tight end position in his play calling.

WARSAW – Thousands took to the streets across Poland on Wednesday for the seventh day of protests against a court ruling that further limits the country's highly restrictive abortion laws.


  Police warned demonstrators not to target churches again after some services were disrupted and buildings defaced in an earlier protest.


  Poland has been rocked by huge demonstrations, most of them peaceful, since its top court ruled last Thursday that abortion due to fetal abnormalities was not permissible under the constitution.


  The decision means only abortions due to incest, rape or a risk to the mother's health remain legal, setting predominantly Catholic Poland far apart from the European mainstream.


  Demonstrators have blamed the nationalist government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the Roman Catholic Church which has close ties to the ruling Law and Justice party for the court verdict.


  In a rare display of anger against the Church last Sunday, demonstrators in Warsaw, Poznan and Katowice disrupted church services and defaced church buildings.


  On Wednesday, organizers called for a nationwide walk-out for women at work. Some employers, including schools, announced a day off to allow people to join the protests.


  Chanting "hypocrites, fanatics," thousands marched through central Warsaw, some carrying posters that read "Revolution is a woman" and "I'd rather stay home but I have a government to overthrow."


  "In light of plans being announced by organizers for further acts of aggression and profanation, the police will take decisive action. The goal of the police is to ensure public order and safety for all citizens," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

And while in the neighborhood, Klubnik also got a look at Georgia. Clemson has not yet offered, and Georgia offered late last week. Klubnick and his parents visited on their own as the NCAA has banned all official and unofficial visits thru the end of this calendar year. So, Klubnik could walk around and buy a ticket for the Syracuse game, but he couldn't visit with or talk to coaches.
 "We went to the game on Saturday, and we walked around town for awhile and drove and walked around campus, ate dinner and some more on Sunday," Klubnik said. "We were just kind of own our own. We ended up slipping by the (football administration) facility, not going inside obviously, because everything was on our own. We couldn't do anything with the coaches, couldn't talk to them, couldn't go inside anywhere, but we still got a really good look at everything. It was really fun."
 Klubnik added that from the outside, the Allen N. Reeves football administration facility looked impressive.
 "It's huge. It's big," Klubnik said. "I've done some video tours with them just seeing the inside, and some tours around and seeing what's really going on day to day, and it's really, really, really good. Just great facilities, 21st century stuff. It's really good stuff, very unique and different. I really like it."

 Even in the playoffs, Lutheran High isn’t catching a break. All eight-man first-round games were last Thursday, and the Eagles host Weeping Water as part of Friday’s second-round action — at 3 p.m.
 That’s in part because 132 miles separate the visiting Indians from Veterans Memorial Park. But it’s also because Norfolk Catholic hosts David City Aquinas, which makes a 71-mile trek to Norfolk for their Class C2 first-round game at 7 p.m.
 “When it comes to the playoffs, you work with the opposing school,” Suckstorf said. “Weeping Water didn’t have school that day, and they wanted an earlier kickoff. Aquinas and Norfolk Catholic didn’t mind the later kickoff.”

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has opened up a slight lead over President Donald Trump in Georgia less than a week before Election Day, according to a new poll.
 The statewide survey of 504 registered Georgia voters conducted by New Jersey’s Monmouth University Polling Institute Oct. 23-27 found Biden’s support at 50% and Trump’s at 45%. The poll’s margin of error is plus-or-minus 4.4%.
 More than half (58%) of the voters surveyed said they had already cast their ballots. Among that group, Biden enjoyed a huge lead, 55% to 43%. Trump held a 48% to 44% advantage among those who had yet to vote.
 “Trump is likely to win the Election Day vote. The question is by how much,” said Patrick Murray, the polling institute’s director. “The Democratic voters left on the table at this point tend to be less engaged and thus harder to turn out. So, it is still possible for Trump to make up his deficit in the early vote.”
 In demographic breakdowns, Trump held a solid lead among voters ages 65 and older, 58% to 42%. That’s a bit less of an advantage than the 61% to 36% margin for Trump in a Monmouth poll released last month.
 However, Biden holds a 54% to 40% lead over Trump among voters under 50 years old, up from his 47% to 42% lead with this group last month.
 No Democrat running for president has carried Georgia since Bill Clinton won his first term in the White House back in 1992.
 Meanwhile, Democrats running for Georgia’s two U.S. Senate seats also fared well in the Monmouth poll.
 Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff narrowly leads Republican Sen. David Perdue, 49% to 46%, well within the poll’s margin of error. Perdue was six points up on Ossoff in two previous surveys Monmouth released last month and back in July.
 In the other contest, a blanket primary with 20 candidates on the ballot to fill the unexpired term of retired Sen. Johnny Isakson, Democrat Raphael Warnock holds a big lead with 41% of the vote. Warnock has gained steadily, up from 21% last month and just 9% in July, mostly at the expense fellow Democrat Matt Lieberman, who has fallen in the Monmouth poll to just 4% from a high last summer of 14%.
 Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp late last year, and GOP U.S. Rep. Doug Collins of Gainesville are in a close battle for second, with Loeffler holding the advantage 21% to 18%.
 “Loeffler and Collins are now battling it out for a spot in the runoff,” Murray said. “It may come down to who is seen as the stronger Trump loyalist among Republican voters.”
 With no one likely to win more than 50% of the vote, the margin needed to avoid a runoff, the expected second round between Warnock and either Loeffler or Collins would be held in early January, possibly determining whether Democrats take control of the Senate or Republicans keep their majority.

I grew up in retail — literally! Some of my earliest memories are playing Bloomingdale’s with my cousins- not just store, but always Bloomingdale’s specifically. I was very close with my grandma who had worked at the Short Hills, NJ location and I had wanted to be just like her- poised, polished, refined, and sophisticated. I was lucky enough to land a summer internship at Bloomingdale’s 59th Street in the summer of 1999 and never looked back! I spent about 15 years in retail total, 13 at Bloomingdale’s in store-line management, and 2 at specialty brands. When I left Bloomingdale’s, I felt a bit lost- it had become such a part of who I was and I was struggling to find a place I belonged. This is about the time that I discovered SoulCycle! Back then there were only a handful of locations in NYC and it felt like my secret oasis where I was part of a secret community. I felt like I belonged in that dark room with blasting music and that is where I realized I needed to be part of a community, but I also wanted to focus my career on building communities and giving that sense of belonging to others. I took my love for the fitness community and decided to pursue a career in fitness management and operations. I joined the Pure Barre Corporate Team in 2013, then transitioned to another barre concept but always had my eye on Xponential Fitness. You can’t work in fitness franchising and not follow the success and growth of Xponential Fitness. I admired Anthony Geisler and Xponential Fitness from afar, and when I heard about the AKT acquisition, I literally said, out loud: I NEED TO BE A PART OF THIS!! Searching the internet for clues on how to get involved became a part of my daily routine; and then a few weeks later I received a call from Michael Ruiz from Global Talent Solutions- and as they say, the rest is history! I truly feel like I put it out in the universe… and someone was listening!

A Scottish oil and gas company linked to the man behind the Democratic Unionist Party’s mysterious £435,000 Brexit donation owes at least £4.5 million to more than fifty investors, openDemocracy has learned.


  Glasgow-based businessman Richard Cook signed a deed of trust between the Scottish company, HGEC Capital Ltd, and a Texas oil firm run by a man described by a judge almost a decade earlier as “a repeat offender with criminal convictions for securities fraud”.


  HGEC Capital Ltd went into administration earlier this year. Documents produced by the administrators now reveal that the company owes at least £4.5 million.


  Known investors include elderly couples, small business owners, and one z-list Scottish celebrity.


  The firm’s director, Kenneth Campbell, could now be summoned to court for a ‘private examination’.


  Earlier this year openDemocracy and the Sunday National revealed Cook’s involvement in the HGEC Capital Ltd scandal. He made a number of visits to the US on the company’s instruction and also registered the firm’s website.


  Cook’s greatest claim to fame is his role as the chairman of the Constitutional Research Council, which made the record-breaking £435,000 gift to the DUP just weeks before the 2016 Brexit vote.


  Under the deed of trust signed by Cook, HGEC Capital Ltd – formed in Glasgow in 2018 – agreed to lend $14.3 million to Texas Gulf Coast Secured Lenders Joint Venture LLC in return for oil and land rights.


  In a brochure allegedly circulated to potential Scottish investors, HGEC Capital Ltd said the current downturn in oil prices presented an opportunity. It listed a number of oil and gas sites in Texas which, it said, were worth $89,360,000 at the time, but which it claimed would could be sold for $666,000,000 in twelve months’ time.


  It seems at least 56 investors handed over cash in the hope that they would see similar returns.


  Despite the millions invested, administrators say they have, so far, been able to find only one bank account, containing just £7700.88.


  Ayr Sheriff Court appointed Begbies Traynor as administrators in February this year following a petition submitted on behalf of an offshore fund registered in the Cayman Islands.


  In the administrators’ latest progress report, lodged with Companies House, Begbies Traynor says that around £1 million was transferred “to and from” a bank account in the US between April and June 2018. However, it has been unable to find “trace of any further transfers” to the States after this time.


  According to HGEC Capital Ltd's bank statements, all sums invested after June 2018 “were distributed shortly after receipt to various parties, including Mr Campbell”.


  The administrators have now written to the recipients of larger sums “seeking a clear explanation and entitlement to such monies”.


  Lawyers acting for Cook say he is not one of these recipients.


  The administrators have criticised Campbell, accusing him of ignoring requests for details of the company’s finances, and all books and records.


  They say Campbell's "failure to provide satisfactory cooperation” has made their work “significantly more difficult than would normally be expected".


  Begbies Traynor say it will ask Campbell to pay back more than £1 million in HGEC’s funds paid to him or “personal payments made on his behalf”.


  The real owner of the Texan properties, according to the deed signed by Cook, was a company called Houston Gulf Energy Corporation. This firm was run by John Ehrman, who at the time was being indicted by a grand jury over a $2.3 million lease fraud involving a series of oil wells in Texas.


  He was sentenced to 42 months in prison for fraud in August 2018.


  Cook made the news back in 2017 when he was named as the chair of the Constitutional Research Council, the mysterious organisation behind a record- breaking £435,000 donation to the DUP during the Brexit referendum.


  Most of the money was spent outside Northern Ireland, including a prominent wraparound advert in the Metro newspaper – which is not available in Northern Ireland.


  The identity of the CRC’s donors have never been made public due to donor secrecy laws.


  Campbell, meanwhile, has been involved with football clubs in the past, and is reasonably well known in the game. He sponsored shirts for Clyde FC in 2015.


  It is understood HGEC approached a number of high-profile footballers, including players for Rangers and Celtic, though none appears on a list of unsecured creditors that Begbies Traynor, lodged with Companies House earlier this year.


  However, the document does name Cheryl Dunn, who, according to recent media reports, is the partner of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. She is also a former business partner of Campbell.


  Asked about HGEC Capital, lawyers acting for Cook said he was “retained to report to HGEC on certain investments he was instructed HGEC wished to make”.


  They added: ”He visited the US on a number of occasions on HGEC’s instruction in relation to that.


  “Mr Cook had no involvement with any investor in, or in securing any investment in, HGEC.


  “At no time did Mr Cook ever have a mandate on or access to any bank accounts operated by HGEC, whether used for investor monies or otherwise.


  “Mr Cook has worked with Begbies Traynor and the Administrators of HGEC since their appointment and has cooperated fully with them.


  “He has been retained by creditors of HGEC to advise them with a view to securing recovery of funds. In the circumstances, where investigations and potential recovery are ongoing, any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.


  “Any inference or allegation that Mr Cook took decisions for or acted in any way as a principal of HGEC is entirely denied.”


  Campbell did not respond to requests for a comment. Dunn could not be reached for comment.

Georgia voters will decide whether to make it easier to sue the state and local governments as well as whether it should be harder for the state to spend fees collected for designated purposes on other things. A pair of proposed amendments to Georgia's constitution dealing with those issues appear at the bottom of the November ballot. There's also a referendum on whether to grant a tax break to one of Georgia’s most prominent charities. All three measures passed the state legislature, but also require approval by a majority of voters to take effect. Here's a look at the 2020 ballot questions. ___ TRUTH IN SPENDING Each year, Georgia collects millions of dollars in special fees that are supposed to pay for specific needs such as disposal of scrap tires, cleaning up landfills, educating new drivers and training law enforcement officers. But nothing in state law requires spending those fees on their intended purposes, and lawmakers have often diverted them to the state's general fund to cover other expenses. The first amendment on the ballot would allow lawmakers to set up dedicated trust funds that would make it more difficult to spend the earmarked money for other purposes. Lawmakers would have to vote to renew the trust funds every 10 years. In the past, some lawmakers opposed locking in revenues for specific uses, fearing they would be unable to tap into that money in a budget crisis. The amendment on the ballot authorizes the governor or the legislature to dip into designated fees if necessary in a financial emergency. The Association County Commissioners of Georgia supports the amendment. The group says the state over the past decade has diverted more than $147 million collected to clean up hazardous waste sites, dispose of scrap tires, promote recycling and...

Just about everything is different in 2020, and the November election is no exception. One of the biggest differences is that there may not be a clear winner on election night.


  It’s natural to feel on edge about not having all the answers on election night. But one of our most important rights as Americans is the right to vote, and election officials have a duty to ensure that every eligible vote is counted. We have to count and verify every ballot that is cast — from members of the military who send in their vote from overseas, to people with pre- existing conditions voting absentee because of the coronavirus, to people who vote on Election Day.


  It is going to take longer to count the votes and verify a winner in the election — and that’s OK.


  This year, more people are voting absentee than ever before. Absentee ballots take longer to count because of security measures to verify the accuracy of those ballots. Election judges go through every ballot by hand to ensure that each voters’ information is accurate. They make sure the Minnesota driver's license or ID number or Social Security number on the ballot matches exactly with the original absentee ballot application. The judges also check to make sure every envelope is signed and has the correct information. After the ballots are accepted or rejected, they're scanned into the state's system, with each voter getting their own barcode. This is when you can go to the online ballot tracker on the Minnesota Secretary of State's website, where it will tell you when your ballot has been received and counted. And just like many workplaces, election officials are being careful to stay socially distanced and are sometimes working with reduced staff or fewer resources.


  Minnesota has one of the safest and most secure elections systems in the country, and is well-known for leading the nation in voter turnout. More than one million Minnesotans have already voted early. We should be proud of our high voter turnout and modern election system. This year, we also need to be patient so election officials can take the time to make sure every eligible vote is counted accurately.


  When our election officials take the time to count and verify every ballot, that’s a sign that our democracy is working.

New Delhi [India], October 29 (ANI): Hitting out at Pakistan, India on Thursday said that the "whole world knew about "Pakistan's role in supporting terrorism" and that it should not even attempt to play the victim.   External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at the weekly media briefing that Pakistan provides shelter to the maximum number of UN proscribed terrorists.   "The whole world knows the truth about Pakistan and its role in supporting terrorism. No amount of denial can hide this truth. The country which provides shelter to the maximum number of UN proscribed terrorists should not even attempt to play victim," he said at the weekly media briefing.   He was responding to a query about Pakistan Foreign Ministry's accusations against India.   Srivastava also said that recent decisions concerning land laws in Jammu and Kashmir was an internal matter of India and no country has locus standi to comment on them.   "The government has taken a number of measures in recent times for the socio- economic development and for improvement of livelihood in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. Therefore, these decisions relate to the internal affairs of India and no country has locus standi to comment on this," he said.   He was asked about Pakistan's reaction on the recent changes in land laws in Jammu and Kashmir.   In another development, Pakistan Federal Minister Fawad Chaudhry boasted in National Assembly on Thursday that "Pulwama was achievement under leadership of Imran Khan" in an official acknowledgement of the country's role in Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.

You all also have credit (for it), Chaudhry told the Pakistan National Assembly.   Pakistan earlier this month suffered a major setback as Financial Action Task Force (FATF) declared that the country will continue to remain on it's Grey List. The anti-terror financing watchdog had also asked it to continue to work on implementing action plan to address its strategic deficiencies including demonstrating that its law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terrorist financing activity and demonstrating that prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.   It also asked Pakistan to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, identifying and freezing assets and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.

The treacle will set hard so be careful when it comes to breaking with a rolling pin. If you don't want pieces of treacle to fly everywhere when breaking up, place a kitchen or tea towel over the top before smashing. Or pop the treacle in a freezer bag and make sure it's zipped securely closed before smashing the treacle toffee. Though if you're going to do it this way be sure to squeeze all of the air out of the bag before closing, otherwise it might pop!

I would not say I am waiting for a black man, but the older I get, the more weddings I attend where my brothers or cousins marry a white woman, the seemingly intentional lack of eye contact I receive while black men sidle up to my non-black friends in the club, the more I feel it will never happen for me.

Jacksonville Mayor Johnny Smith several streets had been blocked by trees, but all had been cleared by sunrise. He said there was still debris all over the city, and cleanup efforts would likely take days.


  “They’re making good progress,” Smith said of the city’s cleanup efforts.


  According to Smith, one area in the city, from James Street to College Street, remained without power. Included in that area was City Hall, the Public Square and the public library, he said.


  Anniston Assistant Fire Chief Eric Arnold said via text message firefighters responded to numerous calls, mainly involving wrecks, fallen trees and downed power lines.


  In Oxford and Jacksonville, fire officials said that while the storm did result in fire calls, there were no major structure fires. Jacksonville assistant fire chief Randy Childs said there were some incidents in which trees caught fire after they fell on power lines. Childs said firefighters knew of at least three incidents in which trees fell on houses in Jacksonville.


  Smith said one family was trapped inside their home because of a fallen tree, but they were quickly rescued.


  Barton said there are no known serious injuries from the storm so far.


  Barton said some of this morning’s car accidents involved drivers striking downed trees.


  “If you don’t have to get out and about this morning, please do not,” he said.

Austin, Texas quarterback Cade Klubnik (6-foot-3, 178 pounds) came to Clemson Saturday to see the town, campus and program in person for the first time. And while in the neighborhood, Klubnik also got a look at Georgia. Clemson has not yet offered, and Georgia offered late last week. Klubnick and his parents visited on their own as the NCAA has banned all official and unofficial visits thru the end of this calendar year. So, Klubnik could walk around and buy a ticket for the Syracuse game, but he couldn't visit with or talk to coaches.


  "We went to the game on Saturday, and we walked around town for awhile and drove and walked around campus, ate dinner and some more on Sunday," Klubnik said. "We were just kind of own our own. We ended up slipping by the (football administration) facility, not going inside obviously, because everything was on our own. We couldn't do anything with the coaches, couldn't talk to them, couldn't go inside anywhere, but we still got a really good look at everything. It was really fun."


  Klubnik added that from the outside, the Allen N. Reeves football administration facility looked impressive.


  "It's huge. It's big," Klubnik said. "I've done some video tours with them just seeing the inside, and some tours around and seeing what's really going on day to day, and it's really, really, really good. Just great facilities, 21st century stuff. It's really good stuff, very unique and different. I really like it."

"One of the cool things that I've made that really grosses people out is what we call 'pus pockets.' And, so, it's a single piece of Bubble Wrap (and) a single bubble from large Bubble Wrap. We pull the air out of it, and we fill it with a mixture of lotion, yellow food coloring and a little bit of water. And we inject that into that bubble. And then we put it under a piece of fake skin. And so the learners can incise the skin. They can squeeze and drain the cyst. And they can actually remove the cyst wall because the bubble stays in there. But it's really funny because I know it's lotion, but the learners don't. And, so, it's one of those things that makes me laugh because it really grosses people out."

The second amendment on the ballot would essentially undo a 2014 ruling by the Georgia Supreme Court that decided the state and local governments could only be sued if they agreed to it. The legal concept, known as sovereign immunity, comes from English law and is commonly summarized to mean "the king can do no wrong."

QUINCY — After 24 hours riding the roller coaster of whether prep basketball will be played in Illinois, Andy Douglas realizes nothing definitive has been decided.


  Twenty days exist before practices can begin and 34 days remain before the first allowable date for games, should those things happen.


  Getting too elated or deflated at this moment isn’t worth the emotional torture.


  “I think everyone knows now, during this pandemic, things change daily and weekly,” said Douglas, entering his seventh season as the Quincy High School boys basketball coach. “There’s still plenty of time between now and then for things to go back the other direction. Keep the faith, keep working and it will take care of itself.”


  As pragmatic as that is, Douglas can’t deny he’s a little antsy for a resolution.


  “Our hands are so tied there is nothing else you can do but wait,” Douglas said. “We’ve had that conversation with our guys before. Playing the waiting game is very difficult to do. The older you get, the more you find that out. That’s kind of where we are now.”


  Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reclassified basketball as a high-risk sport and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during his daily briefing the winter sports season was being put “on hold.”


  Wednesday, the Illinois High School Association Board of Directors decided to defy the Governor’s orders and move forward with basketball season, releasing a statement in which it “has not been presented any causal evidence that rising COVID-19 cases make basketball more dangerous to play by the IDPH or any other health organization nationally or internationally.”


  In essence, it was the board taking a stand against a state government holding back on activities when nearby states continue to play sports without restrictions.


  “This was our board’s recognition we’ve reached the point where we really need to do something that is student-centered and get these students back competing,” IHSA executive director Craig Anderson said. “In their opinions, we can do it safely. Collectively, the board through their discussions landed on this is the time.”


  It created surprise and shock among coaches, athletes and fans.


  “I’m not going to lie, I got a sense of excitement for the sports it affects,” Pittsfield boys basketball coach Brad Tomhave said. “As we know, as this whole pandemic has created, you can’t help but ask yourself what’s coming next. That’s kind of been the process.


  “We will let it filter and see what the coming hours and coming days bring to try to process it.”


  What’s next could be litigation.


  In its statement, the IHSA board placed the final decision on whether to play on individual school districts, their superintendents and their school boards. Asked about it during his daily press briefing, Pritzker brought up the fact there could be legal ramifications for school districts that defy his orders.


  “School districts know what the rules are and it’s unfortunate but they would probably be taking on legal liability if they went ahead and moved beyond what the state has set as the mitigation standard,” Pritzker said.


  Anderson said there had not been an opportunity to investigate Pritzker’s comments and will review that will the IHSA’s legal counsel.


  “I really don’t know what is going to happen from now ‘til Nov. 30,” Anderson said. “It’s a big deal to say to government officials and health departments that we are going to go a different direction from how you are advising. I have no idea how that is going to play out for us.”


  For now, the IHSA trudges forward with its plans on how to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus while providing an indoor competition.


  Among the procedures the IHSA will follow will be requiring everyone in the gym, including players, to wear masks at all times and providing a timeout in the middle of every quarter for players and officials to go to the sideline, socially distance and catch their breath.


  The IHSA also will follow IDPH guidelines limiting groups to 50 or fewer. For basketball, players, coaches, trainers, officials and school personnel will be included in that group of 50.


  It likely means there will be no spectators.


  As Anderson noted and Douglas pointed out, there is more than a month until games will be played. That’s ample time for more changes.


  “Our approach is the same as it has been since the start of the school year,” Douglas said. “We were told November 16 is our start date, so everything we’re doing is in preparation for November 16 and the start of our season. Going about it any other way, at least from my standpoint, the kids are already on a roller coaster of emotion.


  “If you jerk them around and say, ‘We’re going to this, we’re going to that, we’re changing this,’ it messes with where their heads are at. So for us, no matter what is going on, we’re prepping for November 16 and the start of our season. All the work we are doing is in preparation for that.”
