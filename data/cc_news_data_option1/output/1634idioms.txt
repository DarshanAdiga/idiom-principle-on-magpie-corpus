Congressman Brian Mast, R-Stuart, and seven other GOP colleagues tried Tuesday to turn a brief meeting of the U.S. House of Representatives into a pandemic protest -- but they were quickly gaveled out of order.
   
 Mast said their goal was to argue that Congress should be debating legislation to extend the exhausted Payroll Protection Program that offers funds to small business owners suffering hardship because of the coronavirus economic shutdown. But Democrats, who are in control, refused to recognize them.
   
 "We were there to show that we were ready to conduct the business of the House," he said. "It is embarrassing that Speaker Pelosi has not called us into session to debate the PPP."
   
 Mast noted that it will take at least two days for House members to come to Washington.
   
 "We should all be here to act as soon as the Senate does," he said. "We cannot afford to let this go on for another day."
   
 Mast said he expected Democrats would not let him and others speak at the pro- forma session, which often lasts for a few minutes. Votes are not taken at such proceedings.
   
 The exhausted PPP recently distributed $350 billion in relief funds to small businesses. Congressional Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to earmark extra dollars to the program. On Tuesday, the stalemate seemed to have been broken with an agreement to add another $450 billion to the program.
   
 Mast drove to Washington. He left Sunday, stayed overnight in Georgia and arrived in the capital on Monday. Asked about the risks of traveling in the midst of a pandemic, Mast said it is his responsibility as a congressman to come to Washington to vote on matters of crucial importance.
   
 "We all belong here," he said.
   
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been negotiating with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to consider legislation that will be acceptable to Democrats.
   
 "She wants to do all this without talking to anyone," Mast said. "It is like she is saying, 'Everyone else just stay home and we will take care of it.'"
   
 That is not right, he said, noting that all of Congress needs to be part of the process.
   
 "By not being here, it amounts to a dereliction of duty," Mast said.
   
 Mast tweeted last week that Pelosi needed to show some "American grit like our first responders, nurses and doctors."

The labor behind a diaper drive was realized at a distribution event that Mendon Community Schools Superintendent Leasa Griffith dubbed "Fun Friday."
 Coordinated by an anonymous Mendon resident, the drive netted 6,000 diapers, which were included to those in need who also showed up for the district's weekly food distribution over a two-hour window early Friday.
 Griffith said the drive-thru event also featured Chromebook checkout and an opportunity for students to submit their schoolwork packets for the week.
 "With the exception of the week of spring break, the food distribution has been ongoing since March 20 and our food services director through Chartwells, Sarah DeLoach, has applied for a grant that would allow us to continue the food distribution through summer," Griffith said, noting the food kits comprise seven lunches and seven breakfasts per person.
 Distribution initially included 14 single-serve milks, seven for each meal. Griffith laughed as she recalled the struggle of trying to hand out so many cartons to larger families. Wisely, she said, the policy was changed to one gallon of milk per child per week.
 The food is offered through Chartwells, which has been contracted to provide food service to the district. In addition, Griffith said the district has done two separate distributions of food that would be better served for dinner.
 "The dinner foods we gave away were, in fact, from donations and they were for Mendon families specifically," she said. "But this food we give away Friday is for everybody."
 Griffith went out of her way to note that Harding's in Three Rivers has partnered with the district to provide vouchers that Mendon families can use to stock up on essentials at no cost.
 "Harding's has been awesome, just a really, really good business to work with," Griffith said.
 Regarding the diapers distribution Friday, Griffith said enough were on hand to provide bundles of 100 diapers per child to 60 families. That quantity, she said, is enough to last for about two weeks.
 Griffith said another diaper giveaway is planned and it also will feature wipes.
 Through challenging times wrought by coronavirus and the upsetting effects it has created, Griffith said many positives have risen to the surface. The diaper drive, she said, is a good example.
 "One hundred percent … it's been great seeing how people do rise to the occasion, and these weekly food distributions, we've had to hold back on who can come and help because the response is just so great," Griffith said. "What a great problem to have, right? The gratitude we see posted on social media does show that we really are making a difference, that people are being helped."
 Meanwhile, Griffith said the district has coordinated a delivery system and a work packet is delivered weekly to every K-5 student in the district, whether they live in Mendon or are a school-of-choice student.
 Friday's Chromebook checkout was for students in grades 6-12.

An experienced nurse who lives and works in the rural community of Montrose said the virus has taken him out of his comfort zone.
 Montrose is about 265 driving miles southwest of Denver.
 After traveling thousands of miles, through major international cities and foreign countries, the novel coronavirus is even putting people in intensive care units in rural Colorado.
 “Just small rural America,” Jeff Davis, a nurse, said over a Zoom meeting while describing the city of Montrose  “If you go to the grocery store, and you’re out and about, you’re gonna bump into people.”
 Davis, 54, will usually begin a 12-hour shift in the intensive care unit at 7 p.m. and walk out of the building when the sun is rising over the community of 19,500 people.  
 While his shift is busy, Davis said Montrose Memorial has the right equipment for nurses and doctors to handle the current patient load. There are 11 beds in the ICU, some of which have been full of COVID-19 patients living at the edge of death on ventilators.
 Montrose Memorial serves as a hospital, not only for the city of Montrose, but for surrounding smaller cities and towns in other counties.
 And unlike other mountain communities, Montrose didn’t experience a sudden influx of COVID-19 patients, Davis said.
 “We didn't get hammered, all at once," he said. "We had a slow entry into this, and it let us formulate our system and how we are managing our care for these people."
 There have been 89 confirmed cases and nine deaths in Montrose County, according to the state’s latest COVID-19 stats.

 The PFAS investigation in White Pigeon has come to a standstill due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home order, said Paul Andriaachi, environmental health director at Branch-Hillsdale-St. Joseph Community Health Agency.
 Letters were sent to 14 additional homes in an expanded investigation area. That came after 19 homes near GPI Midwest were tested for the chemical. Fourteen of the 19 had some level of contamination, Andriacchi said.
 Residents of the 14 homes were offered bottled water or a countertop filter until testing can be completed. That will not take place until COVID-19 restriction are lifted.
 A voucher program was set up with a local grocer to get water. In case water is not availible, Andriacchi said all would be provided with a filter for drinking water.
 The countertop water filter is capable of filtering one gallon of water at a time. Andriacchi delivered filters to seven of the 14 homes. He said it's possible the other residents have not returned from winter homes.
 Of the confirmed contaminated wells, nine of the 14 have had in-line water filters installed to remove the chemical.
 \"The remainder of those people have decided they would rather wait until after the restrictions are lifted before they would want to have people come in to install those filters,\" Andriacchi said.
 Groundwater from 16 of the monitoring wells tested at the plant was found to contain PFAS at concentrations exceeding the groundwater criteria.
 Based on confirmed test results, the company is listed as a PFAS-contaminated site on the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team's website.
 It was announced this week that Graphic Packaging International, which had purchased White Pigeon Paper last year, will close June 30. Reasons for closure are unrelated to the water-testing situation.

A: Biotechnology companies are very quickly trying to find therapies for the virus. One of the ways that we are getting more quickly to these engineered therapies is using machine learning. We're trying to understand the human immune system. So if you have like a read out of all of the T cells in your body and understand the distribution of those T cells in your bloodstream, you should be able to understand what diseases your body is actively fighting or that has fought in the recent past. The trick is to build mapping between that T cell profile and the actual illnesses. That's the thing that's sort of evaded biologists forever. We are now able to use the techniques of machine learning to build that mapping and a blood test that may be able to help us understand how the immune system is responding.

Yes, it’s better to have WiFi 6 gadgets to take full advantage of this (many premium smartphones are already onboard, so is the iPad Pro) but even those devices with older WiFi standards benefit because WiFi 6 distributes bandwidth around the home intelligently, adjusting it on the fly based on demand. It’s worth noting that WiFi 6 is a big factor in the cost of the Orbi 6 and it is absent from almost all cheaper rivals, including (perhaps surprisingly) Google’s second-gen Nest WiFi.

Power uprate (PU) is considered as a well-regulated and cost-effective technique of improving the net power output of nuclear power plants. The demand for power uprates has risen on the back of the attainable capacity of nuclear power plants and increasing need for electricity on a global platform. Ahead of the terms of their original license, such operating units require license modification in order to ensure a higher level of utility operation. Furthermore, with a view to examine the safety impact of power uprates, the plant modifications demand a safety analysis. In this regard, power uprates have emerged as a fine provider of solutions to battle all such issues.

Moreover, the introduction of crypto- currencies for ransom payments and the growing popularity of ransomware-as-a- service model are working in favor of the growth of the market.

FRANKLIN — Brooks Sturtevant grew up in the 'shadow of Katahdin' in northern Maine. No stranger to hiking and skiing, he tackled a new challenge nearly a decade ago when he decided to take up cycling.
 "It's a good sport for a pandemic when you have to stay close to home," said Sturtevant, "but it's also a great lifetime sport."
 Sturtevant chuckled as he recounted his introduction to biking.
 "Ferdinand Lauffer, a teacher at MVU, told me I needed a bike and he was going to ride with me. He also suggested that I could lose a little weight! I'm glad he did; it's been life-changing.
 "The biking has helped with endurance and being physically ready when ski season starts. I can really crush the mountain when it comes time."
 During the school year, Sturtevant bikes 22 miles round trip to work at MVU.
 Since the schools instituted remote learning, Sturtevant has adjusted his routine and now bikes 13 miles in the morning, usually leaving at 5 am.
 One event that Sturtevant looks forward to, the Kelly Brush Ride, takes place in Middlebury in September.
 Riders of all ages can participate in 10, 20, 50, and 100 mile rides through the Champlain Valley.
 The event began in 2006 by Kelly Brush's friends and members of the Middlebury College Alpine Ski Team after she sustained a spinal cord injury racing for the team.
 Money raised at the ride is used to purchase adaptive equipment to help people with spinal cord injuries live active lifestyles.
 "This is what I train for every year. My friend Dena St. Amour got me started with the ride, and now I'm on my 15th year," explained Sturtevant.
 One of his most memorable, non-competitve rides took place shortly after he began riding.
 "In 2014, Ferdinand and I rode to Maine and then hiked Katahdin," said Sturtevant.
 "I grew up in that area, but the fact that we road 300 miles in three days and then hiked Kathandin stood out.
 "We say a moose in Rangley, ME, and being from Maine, I knew that moose could be a little crazy. We got a couple of photos and rode past it."
 Last year, Sturtevant set a goal to ride 2,019 miles in 2019. He tracked his progress with the fitness app, Strava. He had someone else who also helped him reach his goal.
 "Brenna, my wife, has been so great. I could never do this without her."
 Sturtevant plans to bike 2,020 miles in 2020.
 "I just have to ride one more mile," said Sturtevant with a smile.
 All the biking has made Sturtevant more aware of the challenges cyclists face.
 "I try to make myself visible on the road, stay single file when I bike with a friend and ride early to get off the road before it gets busy," said Sturtevant.
 "Most drivers are understanding; as a cyclist, when you get a routine going, drivers anticipate your presence and are very considerate. I appreciate that."
 Biking has become a four-season sport for Sturtevant.
 "I made my mind up that I wanted to challenge myself and not just ride in great weather.
 "You have to get to a place where the weather doesn't control you, you're not making excuses, and you're sticking to your routine," explained Sturtevant. "Winter miles equal summer smiles."
 Sturtevant puts studded tires on his bike and wears wind and water-resistant clothing. The winter rides are some of his favorites.
 "People think I'm crazy, but I guess I love the challenge, and I love staying fit."
 In the summer months, Sturtevant carries plenty of water and snacks if he's taking a long ride.
 Trips to Canada, especially riding past the lovely vineyards, are some of his favorites.
 Taking up a new hobby always has initial expenses, but for Sturtevant, it's been worth the expense.
 "The long term benefits outweigh the cost, and cycling is a great way to start the day off," said Sturtevant.
 "I would encourage people to look into biking. If you live in the sticks, it's great to be able to bang out a quick ride, and it keeps you in shape."
 Sturtevant recommended that new cyclists get fitted at a bike shop to ensure they get a bike they're comfortable with.
 "You don't need a $3000 bike to do this. I spent $800, and I've been riding my bike for ten years."
 Sturtevant also recommended making use of RiseVT and the online site, the Global Cycling Network, to learn about the sport.
 "This is something you can do right around your area. It's perfect for a stay at home sport."
 Biking is also an excellent family activity. Baxter, the oldest of Sturtevant's children, got a new bike for his fifth birthday, and he just started riding with no training wheels.
 "I rode to the Riley Road and back," said Baxter, with an accomplished grin, "and I'm going to teach my sister how to ride!"
 Sturtevant and his son took their first ride together on Easter day.
 "We were missing so many things that day with COVID-19, but that ride was one of those things I'll never forget," said Sturtevant. "I cherish every moment I can ride with Baxter."
 The family invested in a trailer that attaches behind a bicycle to tow their daughter Lydia; this has allowed Brenna to bike more often.
 "Brenna supports me all year long, and I'm glad to support her. Biking is a good activity that we can do together."
 While Baxter showed off his bright orange bike helmet and blue gloves, Sturtevant smiled and mentioned another great reason to stay fit.
 "Once we had kids, I wanted to make sure I'd be around for a while, and I'm hoping this will help."

It turns out the predictions that had Ezra Cleveland going to the Minnesota Vikings were right.
 It just took a little later than most thought.
 Boise State’s star left tackle was selected by the Vikings in the second round of the NFL Draft at No. 58 overall Friday night.
 Many mock drafts had Minnesota taking Cleveland at No. 25 in the first round Thursday night, but he slid all the way to them in the bottom of the second round.
 “When I got the call it was absolutely unbelievable,” Cleveland told the Idaho Press late Friday night. “I can’t describe the emotions in the room. It was everything I dreamed it would be. I’ve wanted to play in the NFL forever so to finally have this happen, it’s unbelievable. It hasn’t fully hit me yet. But when it does I know I’m going to freak out.”
 The wait continues for his former Boise State teammate Curtis Weaver. The 2019 Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year was once thought to be a possible first round pick, but wasn't selected in the second or third rounds Friday.
 Weaver is the all-time Mountain West sacks leader with 34 sacks, and also had 47.5 tackles-for-loss in three years with the Broncos. But he apparently was hurt by an ankle injury suffered late in the season that caused his production to drop.
 The All-American had 13.5 sacks last year, but seven of them came in two games earlier in the season against Portland State and UNLV. With all predraft visits and workouts canceled, Weaver was unable to show teams what he could do when fully healthy.
 Rounds 4-7 are Saturday, beginning at 10 a.m. on ESPN. In addition to Weaver, Boise State's John Hightower, John Molchon and David Moa have a chance at being selected.
 It's a much different story for Cleveland, who is the third-highest offensive line draft pick in Boise State history behind only Ryan Clady (No. 12 overall, 2008) and Daryn Colledge (No. 47, 2006). Those two went on to make more than $75 million in their NFL careers.
 As a kid, Cleveland would dream with his mom about playing in the NFL, telling her he hoped to one day see somebody walking down the road wearing a jersey with his name and number on it. There figure to be plenty of people in Minnesota wearing his jersey soon.
 Minnesota badly needed offensive line help, and it’s possible Cleveland could compete for a starting spot as a rookie.
 "He’s a tough guy who’s athletic," Minnesota director of scouting Jamaal Stephenson told reporters. "We think he’s a guy who’s going to be able to come in and help us right away.”
 Cleveland was the fifth-best offensive tackle entering the draft according to ESPN, but wasn’t one of the six tackles picked in Thursday night’s first round.

 "(Buying) this calibre of player is difficult. I don't see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG," Klopp had said. "I don't see any club, that is how it is.
