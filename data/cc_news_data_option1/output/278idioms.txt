BRAINTREE -- Mayor Charles Kokoros said his proposed debt exclusion on a $63 million borrowing to pay for the town's share of a new South Middle School and other school projects would cost the average homeowner $192 in property taxes per year, and the amount which would decrease after five years.
 Kokoros shared some details of the proposal at Tuesday night's meeting of the town council. The council will vote on Feb. 4 on whether to place the package before voters at a special election on March 28.
 Included in the debt exclusion is $55.5 million for the construction of a new South Middle School with another $31 million coming from already approved state school building funds. Kokoros said that he has studied the town's finances since the day after he won the office, and said the town doesn't have the money in its operating budget to make the loan payments on the school.
 "The only way I see to do it in a fiscally responsible way is a debt exclusion," Kokoros told the council.
 He said the debt exclusion would also give him flexibility to take on other municipal building projects. Since taking office on Jan. 2, Kokoros said he has been touring all municipal and school buildings.
 Former Mayor Joseph Sullivan had proposed borrowing $85.5 million for the South Middle School, with the state money being used to repay the loans. Sullivan had said the town could pay for the new middle school out of the town's operating budget, as was done with the East Middle School expansion and renovation project. That proposal was withdrawn Tuesday night without discussion.
 The package also includes $5 million for the replacement of the roofs at five elementary schools and the Kindergarten center, $1.5 million for a feasibility study of the redevelopment of Braintree High School, and $1 million for security improvements at school buildings.
 All of the items would be subject to voter approval of the debt exclusion. The town would seek funding from the state school building authority for the school roof work.
 District 5 Town Councilor Lawrence Mackin Jr. said it was "disappointing to say the least" that voters are being given a little over two months to decide on the package, or risk losing state school building money. And, he wonders what has changed in recent months that has lead to the need for a debt exclusion.
 "The answer remains to be seen in that the information regarding the funding of this project was never attempted to be explained until now," he said.
 A debt exclusion is a temporary tax increase tied to specific projects and ends when a borrowing is repaid. It differs from a Proposition 2½ override, which is a permanent tax increase.
 The council voted Tuesday night to refer the package to its ways and means committee for a review. The committee has scheduled a meeting for 5:30 p.m. Jan. 29 to discuss it.
 District 5 Councilor Meredith Boericke, who chairs the ways and means committee, says residents who cannot attend the hearing should send their questions about the proposal to the mayor's office, the school superintendent's office or her at mboericke@braintreema.gov.
