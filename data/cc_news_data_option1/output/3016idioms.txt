"With his experience in leading roles on the international stage, Marc-André is the ideal person for the position. He possesses a remarkable ability to develop and maintain business networks, understand regional specificities while mobilizing diverse teams located around the world under a shared vision. Marc-André has a strong sense of public service and commitment that is perfectly aligned with CDPQ's mandate. I firmly believe that he will be a major asset in expanding the reach of our institution—and Québec—in international markets," he added.

This comes after Chinamasa blasted the USA, mainly its ambassadors to Zimbabwe, for allegedly interfering in Zimbabwean politics.      "We remind the US ambassador Brian Nichols and his coterie of gangsters and mercenaries disguised as diplomats that it's high time they get to know Zimbabwe is a sovereign republic and full state under the Montevideo convention.      "If he (Nichols) continues to engage in acts of undermining this republic, mobilising and funding disturbances, coordinating violence and training insurgency, our leadership will not hesitate to give him marching orders. Diplomats should not behave like thugs. … Nichols is a thug. Zanu-PF reminds Nichols that he is not a super diplomat in this country.      "There are several diplomats that are seconded to this republic from the African union member countries and world over.      "They have never masqueraded and pretend to be our prefects as … Nichols is doing. Zimbabwe is not one of the States or provinces that make the USA.      "We fought for this country to preserve it and protect it, not to surrender it to those from whom we tirelessly fought for it.      "Never in our lifetime. Christopher Dell tried it and the shoes proved too big for him. Don't dare," Chinamasa said.

"The one thing about over-the-air radio that really makes a difference is when you're in your car," Korach said. "You're on the road somewhere and you think, 'Hey, there's an A's game on.' So you can just hit the radio dial, and you're there. With some cars, it can be difficult finding the app. You don't want people fumbling around with their app while they're driving."

"I think it's a stark reminder that, you know, sometimes in Formula 1 we are a bit isolated and we all live in our bubbles anyway," said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. "And I think that when somebody like Perez, a veteran driver, is affected like that, it's a stark reminder that these procedures are here for a reason and the procedures we take as a team, the procedures we take as a collective in Formula 1, we do everything we can to ensure that as little unnecessary contact is made either at the race event, away from the race event, within the factory. "
 Horner added that this also shows that, despite the fact that Formula 1 has pulled off successful return races in Austria and Hungary, it's anything but a lock the rest of the season will be contested without interruption. Even an early termination still looms as a possibility down the road.
 "It's very, very difficult and it's a stark reminder that this thing hasn't gone away yet," Horner said. "It's still out there and we are going to be traveling to countries where obviously there are second waves and peaks that are still bubbling away. And that's where as a group, as Formula 1, we do need to keep that discipline with the procedures that are in place. I think that the whole thing was handled well and executed well by the FIA and by the team."

THE United States of America (USA) senate Foreign Relations Committee says Zimbabwe will remain its county's international partner despite Zanu-PF's hostile stance to it.      This comes after Zanu-PF acting spokesperson Patrick Chinamasa on Monday said USA ambassador to Zimbabwe Brian Nichols is a thug and funding a regime change agenda in Harare.      However, the committee said this would not affect the USA relationship with Zimbabwe.      "The US continues to be the strongest international partner of the Zimbabwean people, despite #Zimbabwe's governing party pursuing a policy of name-calling, deflection, and misinformation to justify their current economic and political crisis. Keep up the good work, Amb Nichols," the US foreign relations committee said on its official Twitter account.      On Tuesday, US assistant secretary for African Affairs Tibor Nagy revealed that his government had summoned Zimbabwe ambassador to Washington DC, Ammon Machingambi Mutembwa, to explain Chinamasa's utterances.      "Comments from #Zanu-PF \- while sadly not surprising - are deeply offensive. We have summoned the Ambassador of Zimbabwe to explain," Nagy said.
