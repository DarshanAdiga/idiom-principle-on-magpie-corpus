La Corporación SANOS anunció la campaña “Mantenernos sanos es permanecer Unidos. El virus es real, se contagia y mata” para la prevención del coronavirus, debido a la creciente cantidad de personas que han contraído la enfermedad en los pasados meses.
 “Hacemos un llamado a la ciudadanía a mantenerse alerta y enfocados en la prevención del Covid-19, el porciento de positividad es alto y el incremento en personas infectadas también, especialmente en poblaciones más jóvenes, en comparación con el inicio de la pandemia”, expresó el Lcdo. César Montijo, Director Ejecutivo de SANOS.
 Esta campaña persigue impactar a la población mostrando la gravedad de la enfermedad y las consecuencias letales que tiene el contraer el virus. Es un mensaje a todos los ciudadanos sobre la importancia de protegerse del coronavirus, siguiendo los protocolos del uso correcto de mascarillas, evitar las aglomeraciones y mantener la distancia social. “Exhorto a todos a protegerse y de esta forma evitar que se contagien los demás miembros de la familia”, enfatizó Montijo.
 Por otro lado, el Dr. Anstrong Figueroa, Director Médico de la Corporación SANOS afirma que persiste una alta incidencia de casos positivos tanto sintomáticos como asintomáticos lo que pone en riesgo al paciente de la tercera edad más vulnerable. También, están en alto riesgo pacientes con enfermedades crónicas (diabetes, enfermedad renal, fallo cardiaco, enfermedad pulmonar, enfermedad hepática e inmunocomprometidos).
 “Exhorto a todos a continuar con los tres pilares de la prevención: uso de mascarilla, lavado de manos y distanciamiento social; evitar actividades familiares en grupos y visitas a lugares cerrados concurridos. Puerto Rico, es de todos; seamos parte del frente para detener el coronavirus”, resaltó Figueroa.
 El alcalde de Caguas, Hon. William Miranda Torres, recalcó que "el Municipio de Caguas tiene el firme compromiso de apoyar a la Corporación SANOS en su lucha contra el Covid-19.
 “Mi mensaje a la ciudadanía es que no bajen la guardia. Todos tenemos que entender que enfrentamos a un enemigo invisible y depende de nosotros contrarrestarlo. Estamos ante una crisis global y adaptarnos a vivir tomando medidas como el uso de las mascarillas, el lavado de manos y el distanciamiento social deben ser parte de nuestra rutina diaria porque es nuestra mejor manera de luchar y evitar la propagación de este virus. Tenemos que parar los contagios e impedir el avance de esta enfermedad”, afirmó Miranda Torres quien recordó que la línea telefónica confidencial del Centro de Rastreo y Control del Contagio Covid-19 del Programa Apoyo Positivo Criollo es el 787-296-9292.
 Los objetivos de la campaña son invitar a la concienciación y a desarrollar el sentido de peligro ligado al riesgo de no respetar las medidas de seguridad para prevención de contagio. De igual manera se desea resaltar las consecuencias letales del coronavirus para el individuo y especialmente para su entorno cercano. La meta es reforzar el protocolo de salud así como recordar las medidas de precaución ante la pandemia.
 “La campaña debe sensibilizar y hacer que las personas tomen acción para reducir los contagios. Esta situación que nos aqueja es responsabilidad de todos y no podemos bajar la guardia”, destacó el director ejecutivo de SANOS.
 Al 2 de octubre de 2020, a nivel mundial, se han reportado sobre 35 millones de casos confirmados de Covid-19 y 1.02 millones de muertes confirmadas. Los datos estadísticos también revelan que estas personas infectadas pueden ser asintomáticas o solo mostrar síntomas leves, por lo que pueden creer que no es importante seguir estas recomendaciones. Por el contrario, quienes no tienen síntomas deben entender que, al llegar a sus casas, pueden contagiar a sus padres y abuelos. En la mayoría de los casos, las personas de edad avanzada pueden tener síntomas mucho más graves, requerir la asistencia en cuidados intensivos e incluso morir. De ahí que esta campaña llama a la reflexión de todos.
 El formato de comunicación tradicional ya no está siendo tan efectivo, por lo que necesitamos abordar el tema de manera realista para captar la atención del público”, indicó Montijo.
 SANOS es un centro de salud primaria 330 que brinda servicios de medicina primaria y salud mental en Caguas desde 2005. Actualmente opera desde Plaza Salud SANOS en la Avenida Rafael Cordero esquina Troche; en la Clinica SANOS en el Consolidated Mall y en SANOS Los Prados, en el centro comercial Los Prados. Ademas, brinda servicios medicos a las comunidades en sus dos Unidades Medico Moviles. Para mas informacion sobre SANOS puede visitar www.corpsanos.com

 # Five reasons why you need to bet at multiple sportsbooks
 By Steve Petrella, The Action Network

 It might feel easier to bet at one sportsbook. Your money is all in one place, and you know exactly where to go to find what you want to bet.
 But if you’re in a legal betting state, the quickest way to go from loser to break-even bettor (and hopefully beyond) is by using multiple sportsbooks.

The first important finding is that between the 1870s and the late 1960s a broad range of American social trends improved: Community activism surged, cross party collaboration increased, income inequality fell, social mobility rose, church attendance rose, union membership rose, federal income taxes became more progressive and social spending on the poor rose.
 Many of us think that the gains for African Americans only happened after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but Putnam and Garrett show that the fastest improvements actually happened in the decades before. Black school attendance, income gains, homeownership rates, voter registration rates started rapidly improving in the 1940s and then started slowing in the 1970s and 1980s.

Here are six takeaways from the night’s dueling town halls.
 ##  Trump stomped on his own message with his refusal to denounce QAnon.
 After Trump went through days of headlines and headaches as a result of his refusal to condemn white supremacy during the first presidential debate, he was ready on Thursday to offer a hedge-free denunciation. “I denounce white supremacy, OK?” he said to the moderator, Savannah Guthrie, almost before she had finished her question.
 The rare forcefulness on the topic made Trump’s mealy-mouthed refusal, minutes later, to disavow the false QAnon conspiracy theory all the more stark.
 “I just don’t know about QAnon,” Trump claimed, despite having amplified a discredited claim by the theory’s proponents just days ago.
 Guthrie swiftly walked through how the far-right movement falsely claims Democrats are a satanic cult that practices pedophilia. “Can you just once and for all state that is completely not true and disavow QAnon in its entirety?” she pressed.
 “I do know they are very much against pedophilia — they fight it very hard,” Trump said. Later, he repeated that line, almost with encouragement: “What I do hear about it is they are very strongly against pedophilia. I agree with that. I do agree with that.”
 Trump has long been wary of speaking ill of supporters, and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory are among his most ardent backers. “I understand they like me very much,” he said over the summer, after noting that they “love our country.”
 Guthrie might have delivered the most memorable line of the night when she quizzed Trump about a recent retweet of a discredited conspiracy theory that Biden had orchestrated actions to have SEAL Team 6, one of the country’s elite military units, killed to cover up the supposedly faked death of Osama bin Laden. Trump said with a shrug, “I’ll put it out there.”

Montana-Dakota Utilities made its case before state regulators Friday as to why it wants to raise electric rates, a proposal opposed by some customers amid the economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
 The company seeks a rate increase of $3.35 per month for a household, which adds up to about $40 per year.
 “The size of the increase is alarming,” said Josh Askvig, state director for AARP North Dakota. “Our members cannot afford another $40 per year.”
 Many members of AARP, which advocates for people age 50 and older, are on fixed incomes or have lost jobs during the pandemic, he said.
 His comments to the North Dakota Public Service Commission followed a hearing regulators held with MDU. The company seeks to increase its transmission cost adjustment rider, which appears as a line item on customers’ monthly electric bills and is separate from a general rate case.
 MDU wants to recover another $15.5 million, which is a $6.3 million increase over what it collected through the rider last year. The increase is to cover additional costs tied to a drop in transmission-related revenue received through regional grid operators, as well as new transmission projects, including upgrades near Heskett Station in Mandan and at the MDU substation on Sweet Avenue in downtown Bismarck.
 Commission Chairman Brian Kroshus said MDU is required to come before the PSC each year to adjust the rider. The rider increases some years and decreases in others. On average, the monthly rate has climbed 14 cents annually over the past five years.
 “2020 is certainly an outlier,” Kroshus said.
 Darcy Neigum, director of electric systems operation and planning with MDU, said the utility experienced “a bit of an anomaly this past year” with regard to reduced credits and higher rates through the Southwest Power Pool, a regional transmission organization that operates the power grid across many central states.
 A settlement reached with SPP and other transmission owners last week “will help offset, mitigate some of what we’ve seen,” he said.
 Kroshus asked whether MDU could potentially delay part of the rate increase or spread it out over multiple years.
 “We have to be cognizant that these are challenging times,” he said.
 Company representatives indicated that could be possible, though PSC staff cautioned that costs to customers could increase in the long term.
 “I realize that it kicks the can down the road, in effect,” Kroshus said. “It doesn’t mean the cost goes away, but it just bridges what could potentially be a gap between current conditions and better times. It’s just food for thought.”
 Commissioner Randy Christmann said that while he wasn’t completely against the idea, he has concerns about pushing the burden onto future customers down the road.
 “I think it’s only in the most extreme circumstances when we want to shuffle things off until later,” he said.
 Commissioner Julie Fedorchak asked MDU what efforts it had made to secure federal coronavirus relief aid to help mitigate the situation.
 MDU Director of Regulatory Affairs Travis Jacobson said the company looked into a number of programs, but “due to our size, we’re not able to qualify for anything specifically.”
 The company is seeking to implement the new rate on Nov. 1. A delay at the PSC could result in the need to increase rates further, MDU said.
 The PSC did not make a decision on the rate increase Friday.

Even before the fire, Chicago had captured the world’s attention, in part for its startling growth. The swampy patch on the edge of Lake Michigan had developed into a town of around 30,000 people by 1850. In the next 20 years, it grew more than tenfold. As Mr. Smith points out, Chicago’s boom reflected fundamental social changes—industrialization, urbanization, the advance of railroads and a surging influx of the foreign-born, who numbered almost half the city’s population at the time of the fire. In short, Mr. Smith writes, Chicago became “the central stage for the enactment of modernity.”

“We cannot say, ‘A CT value of 34 does not make someone infectious’ across the board,” Culbreath said. “It’s not a universal answer.”
 Tests like the BinaxNOW, on the other hand, are antigen tests, which search for bits of proteins, or antigens, made by the coronavirus. Unlike PCR-based tests, antigen tests do not include a step in which they amplify their targets, making them faster and more convenient but less reliable at finding the virus when it is in low abundance. Some PCR-based tests are thought to be many thousands times more sensitive than antigen tests.
 It’s thus very possible to be antigen negative but PCR positive, while still harboring the virus in the body, Culbreath said.
 The BinaxNOW has emergency clearance from the FDA, but only when administered within seven days after the onset of symptoms. Researchers do not yet know how the test will perform in people outside this window. Trump received several of these tests during his second week of illness, all of which returned negative results.

The White House also reported using two experimental approaches on Trump: a viral culture, in which researchers in a laboratory tried to grow the coronavirus from a sample taken from the president, and a test for subgenomic RNA, a proxy for the presence of actively replicating virus.
 Many types of PCR and antigen tests for the coronavirus have received a green light from the Food and Drug Administration. But viral culture and probes for subgenomic RNA are not currently part of the standard testing tool kit, Culbreath said.
 PCR-based tests are some of many among a suite of so-called molecular tests, which hunt for genetic material exclusive to the coronavirus. These tests include an amplification step, wherein the genetic material is copied over and over until it reaches detectable levels, revealing even very small amounts of the virus.
 Some PCR-based tests can also give an indication of how much virus is lingering in the body — a number called the cycle threshold, or CT, which increases as the virus becomes more scarce.
 A recent PCR test taken by Trump yielded a CT of 34.3, after steadily increasing for several days. Researchers have had trouble growing the virus out of samples taken from people whose PCR tests crest above the low 30s. But exceptions to this trend do exist, and cycle-threshold readings are often inconsistent among different types of PCR-based tests, and even among laboratories using the same test.

 # From The Left: Have faith. Fight for a place to stand. Believe in this promised land
 By Vicki Bush
 Guest columnist
 Upon seeing a recent campaign photo made to look like a decade’s past suburbia group shot of conservative Republican women, in my mind’s eye, I pictured the Proud Boys gang of bully misfits posing with them, as if they had their backs. Because, quite rightly, they are both on the same team – team Trump. And the notion that these thugs, whose hate, suspicion, and white supremacist extremist tactics have the approval of a national political party is a frightening thought – but one that is all too real.
 Donald J. Trump is not just a bad president, he is an unscrupulous person and an enemy of the constitution. I am being represented by those who only use the credibility of a democratic republic for its authority, doing nothing to uphold its ideals and beliefs. And as a citizen, I feel shame for what they have done to my country.
 What happens to all of us, to humanity, has nothing to do with who prays harder, or repents better. What happens to all of us has everything to do with who we are to each other. How we pick up the pieces of our fractured fragmented society and how we deal with the sacred responsibility revealed upon the faces of each of us, and for the other.
 We are but a thin layer in the stratum of the earth’s historical record, interconnected by common consciousness. Always moving forward in a continuous sequence of time. A full circle continuum from the tomb of the womb, to the womb of the tomb.
 In 1934, deep in the gut punch of the Great Depression when the American people were at their most vulnerable, there was, what came to be known as the Plot Against America. A plot involving dozens of right-wing American businessmen; financiers who planned to overturn the government of the United States and install a fascist dictatorship. Backed with corporate money; a sordid dark master plan, an inside game with connections to foreign fascist forces conspired a coup, betraying our country and its constitution.
 In 2016, unwavering in their corruption and content in their deceit, Trump’s Republican Tea Party pre-ordained a syllabus of avarice. A perverted curriculum to seize absolute power and absolute wealth.The rich would get richer. And the unemployed, the poor, and the infirmed; not unlike a fascist regime, would just disappear without a whimper.
 As America bears witness to thousands upon thousands of Covid-19 pandemic deaths, sicknesses, and possible irreparable long-term disabilities, this merciless biological airborne virus has, from its insurgency, been allowed to run rampant and untethered throughout our country. And those who repeatedly and defiantly lied concerning safeguard defenses of this deadly virus; with presence of malice decided to unmask the grim reaper onto innocent victims.
 From the lack of early Trump transition team preparedness, to equipment and testing failures, through the simple concept of wearing a mask for everyone’s protection — fault, most assuredly, lay at the door of the Trump Republican Administration. There is no philosophical Randian cream rising to the top moment; there is only a crime against humanity moment.
 Ask yourself, who do you really want in charge of the next climate crisis natural disaster, or the next pandemic? And what does it say about a political party who would destroy affordable health care for all at this point in time – especially for those with pre-existing conditions. And if the president is benefitting from single-payer, single-provider health care, we all should.
 Colonial America learned the lesson that under the injustice of oppression, fear, and intimidation, it could not thrive. Autocratic imperialism would divide us through dueling loyalties; making us weaker. It would envelop and consume the goodness of the human character; making us falter. And, it would cause us to lose our inception toward an indivisible spirit; the foundation of our democratic republic.
 America has shown the world how democracy prospers and succeeds. How we all deserve fair and safe elections. How we check and balance injustice. How we inquire and question ourselves with an independent free press. How our vision of an engaged and active citizenry keeps us moving forward toward our best days.
 In retrospect, if the iconic presidential political pledge of the buck stops here is truly a promised responsibility to the American people, then it appears that under the Trump Administration’s vulgar totalitarian bravado, not only did “the buck” not stop at the oval office – it melted away like the substance of a dream – a fading dream memory of normalcy; back to a time when an American president did not abuse the power of the office, and was respected throughout the world.
 Never forget, we’re the people, we go on. We are responsible for forming a more perfect union. And we have been given a constitutional right to reclaim those powers from those who abuse them — it’s called the vote!

But then at the beginning of the 1970s, everything got turned upside down with the Supreme Court decision of one man, one vote. And so in the blink of an eye, the East End lost everything. About 600,000 people lived in the West End, 80,000 lived on the East End. In the election of 1972, the western five towns got 23 legislators and the five eastern town got 3. And from that day on, the five western towns got to decide everything.

“Varoom! Screech!” he cried, as he leaned into a hairpin turn into the front- row pew and sat down next to his embarrassed mother. Unshaken, his father interrupted his sermon just long enough to say, “Park it, Philip, and give the keys to your mother!”
 When something goes wrong, our response to it determines the outcome. A bit of humor can often turn the corner from affliction to something more manageable. We usually don’t have to settle for “as is”. If we react with faith and courage, God can help us change our situation. Like Paul wrote, we may feel afflicted but we are not totally crushed, perplexed but not driven to despair.

Carl Smith, an English professor at Northwestern University, dives into this familiar material, and though “Chicago’s Great Fire” doesn’t exactly break new ground, it serves as a wonderfully thoughtful and concise retelling of the tragedy and its aftermath. More important, the book reminds the reader that many of the issues battled over today—the place of immigrants, the nature of poverty, the efficiency and reliability of a democratic government—have cycled through American affairs for more than a century and a half. Of course, some issues aren’t so much cyclical as constant—for example, the Chicago city council’s reputation as a haven for boodlers.

Simply put, there are limits to growth. And NVDA stock is about to hit some of them -- at least in the short run. The company already became one of the world's largest semiconductor firms earlier this year. From that high vantage point, it's worth asking just how much farther the stock can realistically go.

The euthanasia measure, which would also allow assisted suicide, would apply to people who have terminal illnesses, are likely to die within six months, and are enduring “unbearable” suffering.
 Countries that allow some form of euthanasia include The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Belgium and Colombia.
 The marijuana measure would allow people to buy up to 14 grams (0.5 ounce) a day and grow two plants. Other countries that have legalized recreational marijuana include Canada, South Africa, Uruguay, Georgia plus a number of U.S. states.
 Lara Greaves, a lecturer in New Zealand politics at the University of Auckland, said she thinks the marijuana referendum is destined to fail.
 “I think the problem is that we would be going from criminalization, and a bit of medicinal use, to full-on recreational use,” she said. “Probably what needed to happen to get the public on board was to have a phase of decriminalization.”
 She said a large turnout of younger voters would be necessary for the measure to have any hope of passing but that was far from certain.
 Another factor is that Ardern has declined to say how she intends to vote, saying she wants to leave it for people to decide. Greaves said that made a big difference, as people tend to follow their leaders. The prime minister did admit during the campaign to smoking marijuana when she was younger.
 One vocal proponent of the marijuana referendum has been former Prime Minister Helen Clark. A position paper from her foundation argues that indigenous Maori have faced disproportionate and excessive punishment from the legal system when caught with the drug.

Condi says that on that day in 1952, college-educated Reverend John Rice stood before the Democratic Party polling official and told him that he wanted to register to vote. The official pointed toward a jar full of beans, informing John Rice that if he could guess the correct number of beans in the jar, he could vote.

Hodláte-li skladovat sadbový česnek, mořte jej po dobu dvou až tří hodin Sulkou (kapalný sirný koncentrát s obsahem bezchloridového draslíku a dusíku), a to buď v srpnu či září, nebo výrazně později, těsně před výsadbou. V případě první varianty nechte po namoření česnek rychle oschnout, uskladněte jej až do výsadby na dobře větrané místo a těsně před ní pak stroužky namočte na půl hodiny do vody.

Voters also can turn their ballots over to someone else, and that person is supposed to print their name and signature on the ballot before turning it in. A much smaller number of polling places will be open on Election Day to try to limit potential spread of the virus.

Just like it was for Jesus, though, our faith was never supposed to be about us. Jesus said he didn’t come to be served, but to be a servant, so Christianity is not just about what God can do for me, but what God can do for the world through me.
 The purpose of medicine is not to provide comfort for the healthy but to cure the sick. Similarly, the purpose of eternal life is not to provide entertainment for the faithful but for the faithful to demonstrate God’s goodness to those who have been shut out. If at the end of the day, COVID-19 reminds us that faith and life are not about what I can gain but what I can give, then there is still more than enough reason for hope in the future.
