Eyewitness Jerry Kocharian, 62, said he was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and seeming to struggle.
 “It wasn’t sounding right,” he said, “and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy.”
 The craft vanished into the sheet of fog, and then Kocharian heard the boom and saw a fireball.
 “No one could survive that,” he said.
 Later, the L.A. Times confirmed that two of those on board were Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter.

The Lakers acquired the 17-year-old Bryant in a trade shortly after Charlotte drafted him, and he immediately became one of the most exciting and intriguing players in the sport alongside O'Neal, who had signed with the Lakers as a free agent. Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest as an upstart rookie, and the Lakers gradually grew into a team that won three consecutive championships.

"The rocks at those depths are saturated with fluids, although the quantities are minuscule," explained Professor Pascal Audet. "At a depth of 40 km, the pressure exerted on the rocks is very high, which normally tends to drive the fluids out, like a sponge that someone squeezes. However, these fluids are imprisoned in the rocks and are virtually incompressible; the fluid pressure therefore rises to very high values, which essentially weakens the rocks and generates slow earthquakes."

With assorted other in-form options – Exeter’s Sam Simmonds and Harlequins’ Alex Dombrandt – studiously ignored by Jones, it will be fascinating, and instructive, to see who does get the nod to replace Vunipola for a game which could shape England’s entire championship. If it happens to be Ludlam, who has never started a Test at No 8, it will be further reward for one of the more enthusiastic characters in the country.

Ludlam was involved in four games in Japan but started only once, against the USA in Kobe, a game in which he also registered his first Test try. If there are any mental scars lingering from England’s final disappointment against South Africa, they have not affected a player itching for another major challenge. “I probably wasn’t thinking at the start of the season of achieving any World Cup caps. At the end of the day we probably failed in what we wanted to do in winning the World Cup but there were a lot of positives to take from it.”

Luckily they clean your kit as soon as you get out here so it was all straight in the wash bag and ready to go.” Even the merest glimpse of his World Cup kit, though, still prompts a brief surge of pride. “It was a moment because I had all my World Cup shirts and my medal in there. To open that back up and remind me of where I had come from at the World Cup … was a boost for my confidence and brought back some memories as well.”
