ECE Certification refers to the regulation and testing parameters under which products are manufactured under various criteria like the toughness of the material, technology, safety measures involved, etc. to ensure the quality standards meet the safety requirement. Under the new regulation, a product has to undergo 18 safety tests to determine the safety of the product. Also, the new proposed revision to existing ECE specifications will also add new checks and design criteria, such as additional reflectivity, rotational test, modular helmets double code (P/J), new speed and limit for high and low energy impact, oblique impact test method to measure rotational acceleration, the introduction of new possible extra impact points and high-speed particle test to verify the performance of visor. Along with the previous measures like free-fall tests from a fixed height, the retention system test attached with fastened chin strap, a test that measures foam absorption and for reliable protection.

A customer adviser in a Devon branch, who specialises in skincare, said she was "flabbergasted" that she and her colleagues were expected to go in to work..
 "I went in on Monday morning and I witnessed staff hanging around doing nothing – chatting in the canteen because there’s nothing to do," she said.
 She said staff were counting packets of crisps and tidying the stock room to fill time.
 "This is people who are actually travelling on public transport to get into Boots to do these non-essential jobs," she said, adding that she had to take two buses to get to work.
 A sales assistant on the makeup aisle in a branch in north-east England said the store was mostly empty, but people still came in looking at mascaras while staff were "standing around doing nothing".
 "This puts us at extreme risk as it only takes one infected customer to enter the store and pass it on," they claimed.
 "The knock-on effect of this would be huge."
 He acknowledged that it was a "stressful" time for Boots, but added that shop floor staff had not received direct communication from the company and needed more "clarity".

Although the team is not in need of athletes, NAZ Elite is still considering expanding its roster come this summer.
 “I could see adding one to two athletes. I don’t think we need to bring on more than that, but one to two would be possible,” Rosario said.
 While the cancellation of the NCAA indoor championships didn't put a huge dent in how Rosario approaches recruiting, it might have had larger negative impacts on the athletes.
 Now, Rosario said, college runners who did not have an NCAA title to go next to their name -- and had one more chance to do so -- might not have quite the level of recognition that pro teams and sponsors in the running world would like to see.
