Dubai [UAE], September 13 (ANI): Chennai Super Kings (CSK) all-rounder Shane Watson on Sunday shared a glimpse of him and skipper MS Dhoni having a net session ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020.   In the video, both Dhoni and Watson can be seen practising big shots and hitting the ball over the boundary lines.   "At the ripe old age of 39, just two old guys doing what we love," Watson wrote as the caption.   CSK on Friday got a major boost on Friday as pacer Deepak Chahar started training going into their first game of the season against defending champions Mumbai Indians on September 19.   Speaking to ANI, CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan said that Chahar got an all-clear not just from the CSK side but also from the BCCI medical team, and as a result, he was ready to hit the ground running.  
 CSK will be without the services of Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh this year as both players opted out of the tournament due to personal reasons.   Asked about reports that CSK could be going in for another foreign player in Dawid Malan, the CEO answered in the negative.   "This is news to me as well because our quota of foreign players is already full. So I don't know how we can have another foreigner in the squad," he explained.   CSK was the last team to begin training as the side finally returned to the field last week after their third round of coronavirus tests. The team had a dodgy start to their campaign in the UAE as some members of the camp tested positive for COVID-19 and the entire contingent had to quarantine themselves for longer than expected.   The 13th edition of the league will be played from September 19 to November 10, across three venues in the UAE -- Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Dubai. (ANI)

"The stadium has been laid out with seating that will keep everybody physically distanced," Bratzler said, "even when you go to concession areas those areas will promote physical distancing to keep people safe...
 “We know that your risk of getting this infection is greatest when you’re in close proximity to somebody and you don’t have a mask on," Bratzler continued. "When somebody else is speaking or even breathing, droplets are coming out of your mouth, so that’s why we’re so strongly encouraging the wearing of masks. The only time we’re going to let people take masks off in the stadium is if they’re drinking something or eating something, but people need to stay in their masks."
 Castiglione said back in August masks were going to a be a requirement, and urged fans to follow suit in staying safe.
 "If we're able to have fans and have a game, there's going to be a masking requirement," Castiglione said back in August. "To come into the stadium, and to stay in the stadium, you'll have to be wearing a mask for the entire experience. That's just the way it's going to be.
 "I understand that might not be what people want to do. I respect that. I respect that they don't want to go to the game and wear a mask. But if you're going to come to the game in Oklahoma, it's going to be a requirement."

I thought I got more consistent and was able to get more comfortable with the offense. So, there’s obviously room to be better for this next year. And for myself, I’m just trying to be as consistent as possible and play at a high level.”
 Gase’s admission that “it just seems like everything’s a step faster this year” for Darnold, because “he seems way more comfortable” is promising.
 “Some of the throws that he makes…” Gase said. “It’s one of those things where you just shake your head like, ‘How did he make that throw?’”
 Darnold will have to make a lot of those types of plays for the Jets to be relevant this season. It’s a heavy burden to ask of a young quarterback without much help.

Abu Dhabi [UAE], September 13 (ANI): West Indies all-rounders Sunil Narine and Andre Russell on Sunday arrived in Abu Dhabi to join the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad ahead of the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).   Along with them, KKR coach Brendon McCullum and spinner Chris Green also arrived in Abu Dhabi to link up with the squad.   All these people will now be confined to their hotel room for six days as they undergo quarantine as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus. If the players return with three negative COVID tests in this time frame, then they will join their teammates in training ahead of the tournament.  
 All players and team personnel are required to undergo a six-day quarantine period after landing in the UAE and everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19 thrice. Once, they all test negative for COVID-19, the players can start training in the UAE with their teammates.   McCullum was the coach of Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and the side just won their fourth CPL title this year on Thursday night. Narine was part of the tournament winning side while Russell played for Jamaica Tallawahs.   The IPL 2020 will be played from September 19 till November 10 in the UAE across three venues -- Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah. Mumbai Indians will lock horns with Chennai Super Kings in the tournament opener on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.   Kolkata Knight Riders will take on Mumbai Indians in their first match of the tournament on September 23. (ANI)

As with other reggae stars, Hibbert’s following soared after the release of the landmark 1972 film, “The Harder They Come,” which starred Jimmy Cliff as a poor Jamaican who moves to Kingston and dreams of a career in music. The Jamaican production was a word of mouth hit in the U.S. and the soundtrack, often ranked among the greatest in movie history, included the Maytals’ “Pressure Drop” and “Sweet and Dandy.” Hibbert also appeared in the film, as himself, recording “Sweet and Dandy” in the studio while Cliff's character looks on with awe. Around the same time, the Maytals signed with Island Records and released the acclaimed album “Funky Kingston,” which the critic Lester Bangs called “the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.” (The album would eventually come out in two different versions).

Sure, Missouri State is an FCS opponent, but OU still resembled a well-oiled machine able to battle through adversity. Players are tested three times on game week, and the healthy guys are more than capable of filling the gaps.
 The fan experience was a different story. While there were many gaps – as required – in most of the stadium, fans in the student section often ignored OU’s mask mandate, and on a plethora of seats in the student section, there were stickers that read, “Please leave this seat vacant.” Spectators ripped those off and sat where they pleased. Per an email from a spectator sent to The Daily, security who tried to enforce mask wearing and socially-distanced seating were ignored and sometimes berated.
 Saturday night’s attendance of 22,700 – in a venue that seats 86,112 – experienced a new era of college football. In a sellout game, over 63,000 seats remained empty while cardboard cutouts lined the lower rows behind the team sidelines.
 In an interview recorded Friday and played on the radio broadcast at halftime, OU’s chief COVID officer Dr. Dale Bratzler listed the necessary safety measures for ensuring the safety of fans watching the game in person.
 "The stadium has been laid out with seating that will keep everybody physically distanced...," Bratzler said. "We know that your risk of getting this infection is greatest when you’re in close proximity to somebody and you don’t have a mask on. When somebody else is speaking or even breathing, droplets are coming out of your mouth, so that’s why we’re so strongly encouraging the wearing of masks.”
 That interview aired as those very precautions were being ignored in multiple areas in the stadium, especially the student section.
 OU Vice President and Athletics Director Joe Castiglione said in an interview with Chris Plank at halftime that “game day has gone as good as we could have hoped.”
 Only time – and test results, for both those on the field and in the stands – will tell what is ahead for the rest of the season.
 While on the field it was a success, there’s still at least nine more games scheduled. The Sooners host Kansas State on Sept. 26, a two-week gap the athletic department built into the schedule to gauge the aftermath of game one. And then face their first road game in the COVID-19 era — at Iowa State.
 Saturday night was both exciting and flawed, with highlights and worrisome moments. In short, perhaps a glimpse of what to expect the rest of the way.

BARBARA JEAN LONGI Barbara Jean Longi passed away Sunday September 6, 2020 in her home where all her loved ones were able to comfort her and she was surrounded by love. Barbara was born January 7, 1934 in Kings Mills, Ohio to John and Edna Price. She met her husband Michael Louis Longi Jr in Cincinnati, Ohio. She is survived by her 6 children; Monica Habart, Teresa Canfora, Michael Longi, Lisa Blankenship, Louis Longi and Peter Longi. Barbara was a great woman who instilled a strong work ethic and moral character in her children that will carry on as her legacy. Barbara and Mike moved to Hamilton, Ohio where they built, owned and operated the family roller skating rink for many years. In 1977, they moved the family to Las Vegas to be part of an exciting and fabulous city that was flourishing. In Las Vegas Barbara worked at Buster Brown Textiles and Dick Blick Art Supplies. Barbara became a widow in 1989 with the passing of her husband Mike at age 54 from cancer. In 1989 she was part of the opening team at The Mirage where she was a Cashier in the Buffet. She loved working at The Mirage and especially enjoyed the customers she would meet in her 20 years working there. In her retirement she lived for her 9 grandchildren; Zachary Habart, Jessica Mavrogenes, Rachel Carlin, Nicholas Longi, Christopher Longi, Sophia Longi, Brandi Spiller, Isabella Longi and Sarah Longi. In the circle of life, Barbara became a great- grandmother to Emilia Carlin a week before her passing. This made her so very happy. Barbara was a joy to be around and lived by the golden rule of treating others the way you want to be treated. She was the family matriarch and rock. She is also survived by her sisters Janet Lawson and Sandra Timberlake and brother John Price from Ohio. Graveside services are planned for Woodlawn Cemetery Tuesday September 15 at 10:00AM.

Trusting those around to follow social distancing guidelines was a concern expressed many who attended the game — especially those who are the most at- risk from COVID-19.
 Doug and Pam Evans, a season-ticket holding couple in their 60s from Sioux City, Iowa, drove nine hours to watch the Sooners open their season against the Bears. The couple received their tickets just a week prior to the game.
 “We’ve been coming to the games for years,” Doug said. “We were in a situation of if we got the tickets, great. If we don’t, that’s okay too. (But), we’re really happy to be here.”
 The Evans' were impressed to “see people adhering” to the OU’s mask policy, saying they saw about 75 to 80 percent of fans wearing masks prior to the game’s opening kick. Not having to worry too much about their health, both were saddened about how the capacity limit affected students.
 “We feel for the seniors,” Pam said. “And for the band members that were seniors. They always look like they’re having so much fun... We want to come back and hope that they expand seating and let more people come in because that part’s sad.”
 Nonetheless, despite a lot of fans abiding by the university’s masking protocol, not everyone was completely on board with it.
 Joshua Spear, a sophomore meteorology student at OU, was upset with the low concern shown by those visiting the campus he calls home.
 “I walked around campus for about 45 minutes before the game started just to see how many people showed up and what the new normal looked like for game days,” Spear said. “I was very concerned and angry seeing the huge crowds on campus corner and the lack of mask wearing.
 “The university says that masks are required on campus, yet I did not see a single OUPD or Norman PD officer enforce the policy. As a student it is very frustrating to see the lack of concern. It almost seems like OU is more concerned about football then education.”
 As Oklahoma’s season, along with the rest of the college football world, marches forward, the question of if it can truly adapt to a new normal will be asked time and time again. However, the answer to that question won’t come from on the field — it’ll have to come from the stands, too.

With the performance, Rattler became the first freshman quarterback in program history to toss four touchdown passes in a first career start. Aside from just three incompletions he was flawless, and as he said it would, his play spoke volumes on its own.
 “He certainly had energy and juice but he didn't let that consume him and he didn't try to do too much,” OU head coach Lincoln Riley said after the game of the player he offered as a freshman in high school. “That’s always some of your chief concerns (as a coach). I’m proud of the way he handled the situation. Your first start is always an experience and an emotion that you can't really duplicate or predict until you actually just go in there and truly experience it. His calmness and poise allowed him though, to have a clear mind and make a lot of good decisions.”
 Rattler's teammates echoed that, noting poise beyond his years.
 “(He) didn’t really panic or freak out too much, and he did a really good job of leading the team today,” redshirt senior wide receiver Theo Howard said. “He made a lot of good throws. He just took a lot of command and really controlled the offense well today.”
 Rattler already has the second best Heisman odds in the nation, which will likely skyrocket upon next release thanks to his efforts and the absence of one contender in Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, who resides in the dormant Big Ten.
 Those who bet on Rattler chose wisely, as he backed up his promises Saturday night. But though Rattler had a first start for the ages, the quarterback whisperer inside Riley wants more next time out.
 “He wasn't too high or too low for this one so I thought that was important,” Riley said. “And I thought our line did a really good job early of taking care of him and letting him settle in — which he did pretty quickly — and guys made a couple plays down the field for him. So you know, he did some good things, made a few mistakes like he was gonna make, so you know, all in all, a positive start but a long way to go.”

1]Loosely speaking, the ionosphere comprises the air above heights of 35-40 miles or thereabouts. That air is rarefied. For the sake of comparison, the air at the top of Mount Everest (five miles) is only a third as dense as air at sea level. Go up another five miles and the air is only a third of that again; essentially a tenth of the air density at sea level. The total air mass at _ionospheric_ levels is only a thousandth of the mass of the atmosphere as a whole. At or above those heights, the molecules of the air are not protected from the most energetic solar radiation, which strips electrons from the molecules. And still further up, above 200 miles height, virtually all the molecules are ionized, and their motions are constrained by the Earth’s magnetic field as well as the pressure forces familiar here on the Earth’s surface. This highest region is known as the magnetosphere; it extends out a few Earth radii sunward; in an extended tail, many Earth radii in the opposite direction.
