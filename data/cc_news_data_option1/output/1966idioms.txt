The Swimming Federation of India has requested the Sports Ministry to seek the home ministry’s consent for reopening of pools inside sports complexes so that elite swimmers can resume training.
 In the Ministry of Home Affairs’ guidelines for the fourth phase of the Covid-19 lockdown, sports complexes and stadiums have been allowed to open without spectators, clearing the path for at least the resumption of halted training camps.
 But swimming pools and gyms continue to be out of bounds, prompting the SFI to write to Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, the Indian Olympic Association and the Sports Authority of India.
 “Since the order has been given for reopening the stadia and sports complexes, we have written to Sports Minister, SAI, and IOA to request the Ministry of Home Affairs to let at least the elite swimmers to start training,” SFI Secretary General, Monal Chokshi told PTI.
 “It’s been more than two months since the swimmers entered the water,” he added.
 According to the SFI, opening swimming pools for elite athletes is not the same as “recreational swimming” that is still barred as per the MHA guidelines.
 “There is a difference between recreational swimming pools and the pools for elite athletes. It is in line with the MHA guidelines if these swimmers train in the pools of the sports complexes that are going to open,” Chokshi said.
 The SFI has asked permission for only those swimmers to resume training, who have achieved the ‘B’ qualification mark for next year’s Tokyo Olympics. The list includes the likes of Virdhawal Khade, Srihari Nataraj, Kushagra Rawat and Advait Page.
 Last week, the SFI, along with its various stakeholders, drafted a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) regarding the resumption of training, which was similar to what the US federation has adopted.
 “In the guidelines of the SOP we recommended a few measures like maintaining the chlorine level in the pools and also ensuring that there is only one swimmer per lane while training,” Chokshi said.
 However, since it is not possible to adhere to the guidelines in all the centres, the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool Complex (SPMC), which hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence in Bengaluru are the two sports complexes in the running.
 “These guidelines can’t be monitored across all centres. Only centre heads will be able to recommend where its possible.
 “SAI will decide which one it will be but tentatively we have discussed the SPMC pool at Delhi and the Centre of Sports Excellence at Bangalore,” Chokshi said.

Efforts will be made to re-open the state of California. Nevertheless, officials warn that the battle against the novel coronavirus isn’t over. It’s not possible to totally eliminate COVID-19 within its borders, at least not for the time being, which is why people can’t resume their normal lives. They risk succumbing to illness and even dying. Things won’t get back to normal until people get immunity or an efficient vaccine is discovered. Re-opening plans will be based exclusively on facts and data, not on hopes. This is what the governor announced on April 28. For the time being, there is some stability in the number of coronavirus cases, but there’s no way of knowing if the situation will escalate.

Pritzker has also suggested that non-essential businesses that open can be ordered closed or have their licenses pulled. And he’s said he might withhold federal stimulus funds from areas of the state that go their own way.
 News reports indicate that he is increasingly aware of public unhappiness. But while his temper has been tested, he has shown no public sign of modifying his approach.
 However, one part of his plan will speak volumes about what he is thinking — “contact tracing.” That’s a process where “public-health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact while they may have been infectious.”
 Illinois is in Phase 2 of Pritzker’s five-phase plan. Moving to Phase 3 at the end of May requires the initiation of “contact tracing and monitoring within 24 hours of diagnosis.” Moving to Phase 4 requires contact tracing “for more than 90 percent of cases in region.”
 The language is clear — no progress without a lot of contact tracing. But there’s a big implementation problem.
 “With only 11 days until the first possible ‘Phase 3’ date, and with only a two-county pilot program in place, how can the state be on track to meet its Phase 3 contact tracing requirement?” asks Elizabeth Bauer, author of the “Jane the Actuary” column. “And how does (Pritzker’s) verbal target of aiming for ‘the industry standard of 60 percent’ match up with the Phase 4 requirement of 90 percent?”
 There are 102 counties in Illinois, so dramatically expanding the pilot program in the blink of an eye would be a challenge for even the most competent bureaucrats.
 If the state sticks to Pritzker’s rules, residents will remain indefinitely in the current lockdown. But Pritzker will be there with them, and that’s someplace he doesn’t want to be.
 Bauer noted that the state has been releasing a variety of statistics related to the pandemic but offered “no updates on contact tracing.” She said bureaucrats act “as if they’ve forgotten about these requirements.”
 In other words, it’s the latest version of the pink-demic elephant in the corner of the room.
 “Were (Pritzker) to revise the contact-tracing component, he would further increase calls for revisions of other sorts,” Bauer said. “So long as no one with any particularly strong voice or much political power calls him on this, he continues to be enabled to insist that his plan is unchangeable, set in stone, rather than risking opening it up to the sort of negotiation which he insists is impossible because he is guided solely by ‘science’ and ‘data.’”
 There’s no question that Pritzker is insulated from public opinion. He’s not up for re-election until 2022. He and his fellow Democrats have the state wrapped up tight and his multibillion-dollar fortune to keep it that way.
 But a respect for public opinion places limits on the actions of even the most audacious elected officials. Will Pritzker acknowledge his limits if he thinks few people will notice?

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately, close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.      It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation and imitations.      But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.      These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.      But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.      The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" \- and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.      As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.      If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.      "The Trip to Greece" will be available on cable and digital VOD starting May 22.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

COVID-19 has impacted every aspect of our lives, including the 2020 elections. Although there are no plans to change the Aug. 4, primary election or Nov. 3, general election, election officials throughout Kansas are implementing additional measures to protect the health of voters and election workers while also maintaining the security of Kansas elections.
   
 Kansas voters will be able to cast their ballot in-person on Election Day, through advance in-person voting or by advance mail ballot. All Kansas registered voters may request an advance mail ballot without needing an excuse (K.S.A 25-1120). Voters with a permanent illness or disability may apply for a ballot to be mailed prior to every election.
   
 COVID-19 has also led to an increase in misinformation online and through social media. Election-related misinformation is especially prevalent, and we ask that you think twice before sharing. There will be no drastic changes to Kansas elections in 2020.
   
 Finally, the first election deadlines are approaching. The candidate filing deadline is noon June 1. The deadline for a voter to change their party affiliation is June 1 for the primary election. If you have not registered to vote, now is the time. The deadline to register to vote for the primary election is July 14. By acting now to register to vote, change your party affiliation or request an advance mail ballot, you will help ease the burden on our local election offices.
   
 Thank you for the privilege of serving as your Kansas Secretary of State. If you need assistance, please call 785-296-4561 or email election@ks.gov.

 Gale alludes to this on "Point the Finger" with the lyrics, "Dead witness, no coincidence," just as Ice issues a scathing rebuke in the form of the passage, "The fucking badge is the biggest gang we've ever had."
 Of course, police brutality is not a foreign subject to Body Count. The band provoked controversy following the release of their 1992 single, "Cop Killer." In another interesting nugget of local trivia, the Dallas Police Association responded to "Cop Killer" by calling for a boycott against Time-Warner for as long as its subsidiary, Warner Bros. Records, continued to back the single.

The number of COVID-19 deaths at long-term care facilities in Lake County rose by 16 during the past week to a total of 75, according to data released Tuesday by the Lake County Health Department.
 Long-term care facility deaths accounted for about 52% of the 144 coronavirus deaths reported Tuesday in Lake County, records showed.
 However, the total number of positive cases among residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities decreased from 434 as of May 11 to 338 as of Tuesday. The facilities, which self-report data to the county, remove cases from the total after patients are considered to have recovered.
 County data showed the same number — 123 — of COVID-positive staff was reported May 11 and Tuesday.

World number 14 Johanna Konta feels ATP-WTA merger was proposed a long time ago but getting backing from 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has drawn everybody's attention towards it.
 Earlier in April, Federer had proposed that tennis' men's and women's governing bodies should be combined to tackle the effects brought onto the circuit by coronavirus pandemic.
 "Billie Jean King beat him (Federer) to that a long time ago," Konta told reporters as per The Guardian. "So I think it is something that has been talked about for a long time but having Roger vocalise it drew attention to it.
 "I definitely think in the long run it makes sense for it to be one tour, it makes logical sense but I also know there are a lot of moving parts to it, and I know there will be a lot of people who won't want it to happen, but also a lot of people who do want it to happen," the British No.1 added.
 Former World No.1, Federer, had stated that he isn't asking for competitions being merged but only the governing bodies.
 "Am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?" Federer wrote on his Twitter handle.
 'I am not talking about merging competition on the court, but merging the two governing bodies (ATP and WTA) that oversee the men's and women's professional tours.
 "It's too confusing for the fans when there are different ranking systems, different logos, different websites, different tournament categories," he wrote further.

Mother’s Day was celebrated this year in ways not expected a year ago. The impact of the global pandemic has caused ingenuity to blossom along with the spring flowers as local churches and businesses explore alternative ways to keep families connected and served.
 One West Amory church has a long-standing Mother’s Day tradition that was altered due to restrictions imposed. Marty Polk, Harold Burns and Cedric Tisdale all serve in various capacities at St. James United Methodist Church and decided to take its annual tradition to the streets.
 “We normally have a big Mother’s Day event where we honor the mothers in our congregation and provide roses and a complete meal for them after church. Since they couldn’t come to church this year, we decided to come to them,” Polk said.
 It was like an old-time circuit riding minister traveling between preaching points.
 Tisdale has long been the financial underwriter of the Mother’s Day program and joined with Polk and Burns to organize a parade to travel to each mother’s house in their congregation to deliver greeting cards.
 Several cars were decorated with glittering posters and helium balloons for the parade. Other cars joined in as the convoy made its way through West Amory with horns honking. Burns, who is church board president, stepped out of the lead car at every stop along the way to deliver the cards.
 “We noticed other ladies coming out of their homes to see what all the honking was about. We had extra cards with us, so we made extra stops to give out cards. All the smiles were so heartwarming,” Polk said.
 Polk emphasized the outreach efforts of the church are all about ministry, and the efforts were blessed with a perfect day.
 Right down the road in Becker, the Longhorn Fish and Steakhouse, owned by Randy and Cindy Harmon, resurrected the old tradition of dinner on the grounds for Mother’s Day, which turned out to be a huge success, thanks to a picture perfect day with ideal conditions for enjoying an outdoor picnic.
 “It was Randy’s idea. It was all about the experience of helping people get together,” Cindy said.
 The pasture adjacent to the restaurant was divided into lots where patrons could drive out with their orders and set up a picnic.
 “It was a crazy hectic day. One of our girls called in sick, so we were short- handed on top of that,” Cindy said.
 Some families set up tents and tables. Afterwards, several families enjoyed activities such as catching balls and cornhole.
 Cindy estimated 36 families were served, coming from as far away as Tupelo and Vernon, Alabama.
 “Several stopped back by the restaurant to tell us how much they enjoyed the day. Some even called back expressing their thanks,” Cindy said.
 Scott and Laura Lindley and the sons, Joseph and James, were among the families who enjoyed the perfect Mother’s Day picnic.
 “We had drive-in church out in the parking lot this morning and came to enjoy a picnic in the pasture afterwards. This has been a Mother’s Day like no other,” Laura said.
 Other patrons all agreed it was a Mother’s Day that will be remembered.
 The Harmons rode out to the pasture to get a view for themselves after all the orders were filled.
 “It really warmed my heart,” Cindy said.

US births continued to fall last year, leading to the fewest number of newborns in 35 years. The decline is the latest sign of a prolonged national "baby bust" that's been going on for more than a decade, the AP notes. Some experts believe the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy will suppress the numbers further. "This unpredictable environment, and anxiety about the future, is going to make women think twice about having children," said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Emory University. The latest numbers were released Wednesday by the CDC. The report, which is considered preliminary, is based on a review of more than 99% of the birth certificates issued last year. The CDC found the number of births fell about 1% from 2018, to about 3.7 million. Birth rates continued to fall for teen moms and for women in their 20s.

When it comes to landing industries, restaurants and retail locations, there are franchise reps and site managers looking for locations far before communication is made with local representatives. That information begins with data derived from the census.
 “Populations. Households. The extensive data the census gathers, all of those things are what businesses and governments use to make decisions,” said Monroe County Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Chelsea Baulch. “With retail, they deal with local realtors on property acquisition. As far as going through economic development and cities, the only time they communicate with us is for incentives. Should x, y, z company locate somewhere, they’re using this type of data. If they’re wanting to put a certain business here, what stats will make them make that decision?”
 She said data dealing with percentages of families and certain age groups play into box stores, restaurants and companies locating in certain areas.
 “Whether it’s a fast food chain or a retailer, we may could get their contact information and get them marketing material to convince them, ‘You really need to locate your business here because of….’ I’m not saying that storytelling aspect isn’t important in economic development but as we always say, you have to get the first look to get them to come where you are in order to have the conversation, but the numbers don’t lie,” Baulch said. “If a fast food chain is wanting to locate here, they’re not going to give us the first look if our population doesn’t reach their threshold.”
 A subscription-based database listing certain retailers hoping to expand in certain areas is available, but each business has requirements such as population, traffic count and median household data.
 “Completing the census for 2020 is of utmost importance if you’re asking, ‘What can I do to help my community? What can I do to support my city? What can I do to support continuous growth?’” Baulch said.
 Baulch there is a census compilation of data for businesses released between 10-year census counts.
 Other information industries seek such as educational attainment rates, the civilian labor force, average growth rates and employment and wage trends are other examples of data available through U.S. Census Bureau resources.
 “It’s not just the 10-year census but those other sub-categories within the census,” Baulch said. “People are trying to get the numbers to understand who we are and what do we look like and back it up with a story.
 “When a site selector for an industry, a box box or a fast food company is going over all of this and looking at a desktop model and a spreadsheet of where they’d like to locate, before you even get started with land availability and tax incentives and resources, you start looking at population because that’s what categorizes us,” Baulch said.
 She said there’s nearly $5,000 per person that could be tied to the census count in a number of ways such as funding for infrastructure and police protection.
 “The chamber is trying to be an advocate to inform people of this being the time to do it. It’s hugely important for us for economic growth and even community development. We know that stems off of business location, retail location and business expansions,” Baulch said.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our lives and country as no other event has in recent history.
 Health care providers met the virus head on to care for those infected. Manufacturers pivoted their production lines to help provide the much need protection products and medical supplies. Other companies found new ways to provide goods and services. All acted without hesitation, amid a cloud of unclear and shifting rules and requirements placed on businesses, because it was for the good of our country and fellow Americans.
 While our country currently faces a health crisis in its battle against COVID-19, an economic crisis also has gripped our lives, largely because of government-issued orders that closed or restricted businesses and forced millions of Americans out of work.
 Cautiously, Kansas and other states are beginning to reopen their economies. During Gov. Laura Kelly's Phase 1 of her reopen plan, the state's business community proved its commitment to reopening and to safely bringing back their employees and serving their customers.
 There is no doubt it is in the best interests of businesses to keep their customers and employees safe. Unfortunately, it has become clear there are those who seek to penalize businesses with frivolous lawsuits.
 Current liability laws cover some aspects of COVID-19. At issue, however, is the lack of consistent expectations of what defines sufficient safeguards businesses should follow. Each day seems to bring new government guidelines. Don't wear masks. Everyone wears masks. Everyone closes. Some can open. Changing timelines to open, etc.
 The Kansas business community supports liability protection that uses government guidance to define the standard of care and provide some certainty that if companies follow the applicable guidance at the time, they will not be liable.
 Medical liability protection, premise liability protection and product liability protect are all crucial elements to this vital legislation.
 We ask the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Kelly to support the state's businesses and workers by passing targeted, commonsense reforms to protect against abuses of the legal system that would punish businesses who are working tirelessly to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and who are opening their doors after being shuttered by government orders.
 Companies that act in good faith to protect employees and follow available guidelines should not be exposed to costly legal fees for trying to do the right thing. Conversely, providing businesses with targeted and limited liability protections is not the same thing as shielding companies from liability for bad acts. We do not seek reforms that would protect businesses that operate in reckless or intentional disregard of available guidance.
 The Kansas business community is ready to get the Kansas economy growing again. Those businesses who carefully adhere to government guidelines and regulations for the safety of their employees, vendors and customers should not be subjected to the threat of frivolous lawsuits. This commonsense legislation is vital to Kansas economic recovery.

As scientists across the world work frantically to find a vaccine against Covid-19, which continues its rapid global spread, all eyes are on US-based company Moderna's encouraging early results on a small group of healthy volunteers.
 Cautioning that a vaccine is still months, maybe even a year away, experts said the US-based biotechnology firm's results have propelled it to a pole position in the race of 118, say experts.
 Eight candidate vaccines for Covid-19 are in the clinical evaluation, while 110 are in the preclinical stage, according to the WHO's latest draft landscape.  Preclinical development is a stage of research during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected, while clinical trials are research studies performed on people.
 Early data from its vaccine candidate "mRNA-1273" showed it produced protective antibodies in a group of eight healthy volunteers, Moderna said.
   
   
 The other closely watched Covid-19 vaccine is the one being developed by scientists at Oxford University. It appears protective in a small study of six monkeys, promising findings that led to the start of human trials late last month.
 "Because Moderna's is the only vaccine having demonstrated any kind of immunologic response in the Covid-19 field, we would consider this to be the leading candidate," said Michael Breen, associate director, Infectious Disease, at GlobalData, a UK-based data analytics and consulting company.
 "Of the vaccines in human trials, only two have demonstrated any kind of effectiveness," Breen told PTI, noting that the Moderna study proves that the platform can lead to the production of antibodies against a given virus.
 Moderna on Monday announced positive interim clinical data of mRNA-1273, from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
 The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March.
 The study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus, according to the company.
 "Globally, one vaccine candidate that is promising is Moderna's mRNA based vaccine that showed promising results in the early trials," Upasana Ray, assistant professor at CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology in Kolkata, told PTI.
 RNA is the genetic material of the viruses. While conventional vaccines are developed with an inactivated virus or using proteins made by virus, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines work by introducing a synthetic sequence of the viruses' genetic material that encodes the disease-specific protein to trigger the body's immune system, the experts explained.
 Discussing the Oxford University vaccine, she said the work "deserves applause but needs additional supportive information and experiments".
 The preliminary findings of the Oxford study appeared on the preprint server bioRxiv. A preprint is a full draft research paper that is shared publicly before it has been peer reviewed or published in a journal.
 British drug maker AstraZeneca teamed up with researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute in developing the vaccine.
 Breen described their "ChAdOx1 nCoV-19" candidate vaccine as a "standout". "While this vaccine has yet to demonstrate efficacy in humans, it was shown to be able to prevent infection and disease from Covid-19 in a primate model," he said. While this needs to be replicated in humans, it is one of only two vaccines to have demonstrated any effectiveness in reducing infection due to Covid-19, making it a "highly interesting candidate".
 Though the Moderna and the Oxford vaccines are in a leading position, there are several other vaccines, including those being developed in India, in the running.
 In India, eight organisations are in the fray with a vaccine candidate , half of which are companies and the other half non-industry, said Brooke Wilson, associate director, Healthcare, GlobalData.
   "These organisations are running or planning to initiate 12 clinical trials, one is ongoing, recruiting and the other 11 are planned," Wilson told PTI.
 He explained that six of these trials are specifically for a Covid-19 vaccine while the other six trials use a vaccine developed for other indications, such as tuberculosis, adding that the majority of the trials are in Phase I, followed by Phase 3 and Phase 2.
  Explaining the various phases in the development of a vaccine, E. Sreekumar, chief scientific officer at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in Kerala, said Phase 1 trials are small-scale, usually involving few participants, to assess whether the vaccine is safe for humans. Phase 2 trials often involve several hundred subjects, and mainly evaluate the efficacy. "The final phase involves thousands of people to further assess the efficacy of the vaccine over a defined period of time, and can last several months, Sreekumar said.
   Breen also mentioned China-based Sinovac Biotech's PiCoVacc vaccine which he said has demonstrated efficacy in non-human primates, similar to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
 However, he said Sinovac Biotech does not have the global marketing capabilities of AstraZeneca, which could impact worldwide availability of their vaccine.
 In another animal trial, researchers from Fudan University in China last week announced that a single dose of a  SARS-CoV-2 simulating particle vaccine induces potent neutralising activities in mice.
 "These results support further development of ShaCoVacc as a candidate vaccine for Covid-19," the researchers wrote in a paper that appeared in preprint platform BioRxiv.
 A vaccine is designed to protect people before they're exposed to a virus -- in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 -- according to the WHO.
 It basically trains the immune system to recognise and attack the virus when it encounters it, the world health body noted.
 "Vaccine development involves many steps starting from designing the candidate, mice immunisation studies and neutralising antibody repertoire testing, other animal immunisation trials like in ferrets, human safety checks, human trials of various levels before it is approved for general use," said Ray This entire process, she noted, takes at least 12-18 months.
 "However, the extent of worldwide effort been taken in this area is commendable and promising showing hope of a possible efficient vaccine in near future,'' Ray added.
 Umashankar Singh, assistant professor, biological engineering, IIT-Gandhinagar told PTI that the number of different approaches employed for Covid-19 are impressive.
 "My personal understanding is that all of these strategies will yield results that may suit different profiles of recipients and might end up providing immunity, not exclusively though, against different strains of this virus that will emerge, if not there already," he said. The number of Covid-19 cases is close to five million in 188 countries and region with more than 3,23,000 fatalities.

An extremely severe cyclone packing winds of up to 190 kmph roared into West Bengal Wednesday, dumping heavy rain and leaving a trail of destruction that left at least two people dead, officials said.
 After making landfall at 2.30 p.m. between Digha in West Bengal and and Hatiya island in Bangladesh, cyclone Amphan cut a swathe through the coastal areas, flattening fragile dwellings, uprooting trees and electric poles. At least 6.58 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and Odisha before the cyclone struck.
 "The forward sector of the wall cloud region is entering into land in West Bengal. The intensity of the cyclone near its centre as the landfall process started was recorded at 160-170 kmph, gusting to 190 kmph," the weather department said.
 Two women were killed in Howrah district and Minakhan area of North 24 Parganas district due to uprooting of trees, an official said.
 NDRF chief S N Pradhan told a press conference in New Delhi that 20 teams of the federal disaster response force had already begun road clearing operations in Odisha, while the 19 units deployed in West Bengal were shifting people to safety.
 Quoting figures made available by the two states, Pradhan said over 5 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and more than 1.58 lakh in Odisha.
 TV footage showed gigantic tidal waves crashing into a seawall in Digha, close to the landfall site.
 Thick sheets of rain blurred the vast coastline in the two states and surging waters engulfed mud-and-thatch houses, flattening them in a trice.
 Heavy machinery was moved in to clear the roads blocked by falling trees.
 India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra, who jointly addressed the media with Pradhan, said gale-strength winds speeding at 160-170 kmph were pounding South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts and could be gusting up to 185 kmph.
 He said the eye of the monster cyclone, the most explosive part of the cyclonic system, had touched the land, triggering copious rain in the three districts. The eye of the storm itself was 30 km in diameter, he said.
 Mohapatra said the intensity of the rain and winds accompanying it could deceptively look like ebbing away briefly, but will surge afresh once the rear sector of the storm has reached the landmass.
 The whole cyclonic system will have reached the land by 7 pm, he said.
 Reports arriving in Kolkata from North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore said roofs of thatched houses were blown away, and twisted electric poles and broken and uprooted trees bore testimony to the devastation. Streets and homes in low lying areas of Kolkata were swamped with rainwater.
 Mohapatra said the storm will reach Kolkata in all its fury later in the evening and winds blowing at 110-120 kmph, and gusting at 135 kmph, coupled with downpour, will batter the capital city.
 Despite losing its force a bit since Tuesday, the storm, which was categorised as super cyclone at one point of time, has left the two eastern states on edge as it hollered on its destructive path over the Bay of Bengal.
 Intense rainfall was recorded in several areas of Puri, Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Ganjam, Ganjam, Bhadrak and Balasore districts since Tuesday.
 The rains and high-velocity winds will ebb away in Odisha by late Wednesday night by when the cyclone will likely have caused massive damage to standing crops, plantations and infrastructure, Mohapatra said.
 He said tidal surge of up to five metres could occur in North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts that could submerge areas in a radius of 15 km.
 The strong winds and rain could continue till tomorrow in West Bengal, he said.
 The turbulence will likely extend to Assam and Meghalaya, triggering heavy to very heavy rain on Thursday.
 Mohapatra said since the time the depression formed over the Bay of Bengal on May 20 till the cyclone made the landfall, the IMDs predictions about the path it will take and the timing was accurate and helped the disaster response machinery strategise and execute the plans to minimise the damage effectively.

As local business owners are even more dependent on the support of customers following weeks of having their doors closed due to statewide orders, local municipalities are reliant on the sales tax revenue they generate.
 For Amory, 23 percent of the total revenue relies on sales tax.
 “When you shop local, you’re not just purchasing local. You’re helping fund a family, who then turns around and spends it back local. It’s such a good circle. Most of our places who are locally owned are families and they rely on it. It helps them pay their sales tax, their property tax, their real property tax. Maybe they sink more money into their business and when they do that, it helps with their assessed value of property, which helps us too,” said Amory City Clerk Jamie Morgan.
 Aberdeen’s budget relies on the roughly 16 percent derived from sales tax.
 “Sixty seven cents of a dollar stays in your hometown. Our businesses are the heart of our town,” said Aberdeen City Clerk Jackie Benson. “It’s your brick and mortars that sponsor events for the city and school functions. Support your local hometown. This is your hometown. You pay your taxes here. Your families live here. The tax dollars go to support police and fire protection.”
 Nettleton City Clerk Dana Burcham thinks surges of business at Dollar General, Piggly Wiggly and Hometown Market helped make up the difference for stores forced to close their doors to customers during the statewide shelter-in-place order. She added business is booming at retailers since they reopened.
 Morgan and Benson agreed grocery stores sales will help keep cities’ sales tax figures afloat.
 Morgan recently had a Zoom meeting with representatives of the Mississippi State Extension Service, the Mississippi Department of Revenue and economists guessing of how the pandemic will impact sales tax. A minimum 7.6 percent decrease in tax revenue is anticipated for the second quarter of 2020.
 Compared to April, May and June of 2019’s figure of $503,313.32, a 7.6 percent decrease for Amory equals approximately $38,000, or a fully equipped police vehicle.
 Whereas some cities have furloughed city employees in anticipation of sales tax revenue loss, no Monroe County municipality has taken the same action. However, Aberdeen and Amory are under spending freezes for the time being.
 For Amory, the purchase of two new police vehicles and much-needed extrication equipment for the fire department is on hold due to uncertainty of sales tax revenue.
 As local restaurants and retailers switched gears to curbside and delivery through the shelter-in-place order, many came up with creative ideas, which helped continue to generate sales tax.
 “Had it not been for our restaurants here doing that kind of stuff, it would’ve cut sales tax even more. They stepped up and did something different,” Morgan said.
 Benson agreed creative business tactics helped.
 “I think because we’re a small town, it’s not going to be as bad as some of these other cities since they live off their sale tax. Our biggest thing here is our grocery stores. The restaurants we have thought outside of the box to continue to operate,” Benson said.
 One factor contributing towards budgets is fines. Benson said in March, $4,500 in fines was sent to the state and in April, $739 was sent.
 March’s Mississippi Department of Revenue report is reflective of February tax money received by March 14. Out of the total of an approximated total calculation of $891,000, Amory received nearly $160,000.
 According to Aberdeen Comptroller Karen Crump, the city received approximately $830,000 in sales tax for the end of the 2019 fiscal year budget, which was a slight decrease from the predicted $835,000.
 “So far we’re at $472,000 through seven months of reporting,” she said. “It’s been running between $65,000 and $70,000 for the past few months.”
 Forecasting the next fiscal year
 Cities will begin hosting workshops in the summer months for their upcoming fiscal year budgets.
 Morgan expects a new line item for the Fiscal Year ‘20-’21 budget dedicated to personal protective equipment (PPE). Since March, the City of Amory purchased more than $7,000 for gloves, PPE, hand sanitizer, Lysol, bleach and wipes, which wasn’t budgeted.
 “That [budget] line that otherwise may have not existed will have to be created,” she said. “There’s no way you could’ve known it was coming. The only people who apparently knew it was coming, the World Health Organization, didn’t think to tell Amory.”
 She is applying for an Assistance for Firefighters Grant to provide equipment, adding a respirator kit is $1,400, and to equip all the members of the Amory Fire Department would be roughly $35,000.
 Several cities throughout the state, such as Aberdeen, have special diversions for tourism, park and recreation and economic development. Amory is on track to have a December referendum for a restaurant and lodging tax, with the extra sales tax going towards the city’s parks and recreation department.
 While shopping online doesn’t generate nearly the amount of revenue shopping local does, Mississippi cities and counties receive payments for infrastructure improvements through the Mississippi Infrastructure Modernization Act.
 Amory’s first payment in January was roughly $34,000 for six months, a small fraction compared to sales tax revenue for the first quarter of 2020.
 “Just make sure when you purchase things from Amazon, if it calculates based off your location, make sure it’s your address in Amory. If you ship it to your work and work in another city, use your home address,” said Morgan, adding online shopping isn’t nearly as impactful as shopping local.

Former J&K chief minister and National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah on Wednesday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for release of detained politicians ahead of the Eid festival.
 Since his release, Omar Abdullah has made frequent appeals for the release of detained political leaders and those under house arrest.
 "We are days away from Eid. @narendramodi ji should order the release of all detained politicians in J&K, whether under formal detention orders or informal house arrest. They have done nothing to deserve being locked away for as long as they've been," tweeted Omar.
 Omar Abdullah also questioned the J&K government for not replying to the petition challenging the slapping of the Public Safety Act (PSA) on NC general secretary Ali Mohammad Sager, who is under detention since August 5.
 "The J&K govt has had since the 3rd of April to file its reply to the petition challenging the PSA detention of Ali Mohd Sagar Sb & today again failed to do so. The court is happy to let the govt play for time & gave them till 1st June. Clearly they have no suitable reply to give," NC vice president said in another tweet.
 Ahead of August 5, most of the Jammu and Kashmir mainstream politicians including Srinagar MP and former J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti were detained.
 While most were released after their preventive detentions ended, five to six top politicians including NC general secretary Ali Mohammad Sager, former ministers, Nayeem Akthar, Sartaj Madni, Hilal Akbar Lone, Peer Mansoor and former IAS officer Shah Faesal were detained afresh under the PSA. Recently, PSA against Shah Faesal was extended by another three months by the J&K government.
 PSA was withdrawn against several politicians including Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone, but they have been put under house arrest at their official accommodation.
 The recently launched Apni party had also demanded the release of political leaders detained inside and outside the state.

After the reading of Cooper’s letter, several city council members stated that while they could understand Cooper’s viewpoint with concern to the value of his property, they didn’t feel the responsibility of building a wall fell to the Hansens.
 One council member stated that if Cooper was already developing, they could argue for having Hansen put up a fence but as Hansen is the first property to develop, they didn’t think they could force him to put in a fence.
 Council members then stated that if any problems arose that couldn’t be handled amicably between neighbors, then they could look at putting in new codes.
 After discussion concluded, the council then approved a motion to annex the Hansen property into the city as well as change the zone to a commercial area.
 “We’re excited to help the community and bring it together,” said Jordon Graham, General Manager for Squealers and the RV park. “We’re happy to be in Rigby and want to bring families together.”

An extremely severe cyclone packing winds of up to 190 kmph roared into West Bengal Wednesday, dumping heavy rain and leaving a trail of destruction that left at least two people dead, officials said.
 After making landfall at 2.30 p.m. between Digha in West Bengal and and Hatiya island in Bangladesh, cyclone Amphan cut a swathe through the coastal areas, flattening fragile dwellings, uprooting trees and electric poles. At least 6.58 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and Odisha before the cyclone struck.
 "The forward sector of the wall cloud region is entering into land in West Bengal. The intensity of the cyclone near its centre as the landfall process started was recorded at 160-170 kmph, gusting to 190 kmph," the weather department said.
 Two women were killed in Howrah district and Minakhan area of North 24 Parganas district due to uprooting of trees, an official said.
   
   
 NDRF chief S N Pradhan told a press conference in New Delhi that 20 teams of the federal disaster response force had already begun road clearing operations in Odisha, while the 19 units deployed in West Bengal were shifting people to safety.
 Quoting figures made available by the two states, Pradhan said over 5 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and more than 1.58 lakh in Odisha.
 TV footage showed gigantic tidal waves crashing into a seawall in Digha, close to the landfall site.
 Thick sheets of rain blurred the vast coastline in the two states and surging waters engulfed mud-and-thatch houses, flattening them in a trice.
 Heavy machinery was moved in to clear the roads blocked by falling trees.
 India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra, who jointly addressed the media with Pradhan, said gale-strength winds speeding at 160-170 kmph were pounding South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts and could be gusting up to 185 kmph.
 He said the eye of the monster cyclone, the most explosive part of the cyclonic system, had touched the land, triggering copious rain in the three districts. The eye of the storm itself was 30 km in diameter, he said.
 Mohapatra said the intensity of the rain and winds accompanying it could deceptively look like ebbing away briefly, but will surge afresh once the rear sector of the storm has reached the landmass.
 The whole cyclonic system will have reached the land by 7 pm, he said.
 Reports arriving in Kolkata from North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore said roofs of thatched houses were blown away, and twisted electric poles and broken and uprooted trees bore testimony to the devastation. Streets and homes in low lying areas of Kolkata were swamped with rainwater.
 Mohapatra said the storm will reach Kolkata in all its fury later in the evening and winds blowing at 110-120 kmph, and gusting at 135 kmph, coupled with downpour, will batter the capital city.
 Despite losing its force a bit since Tuesday, the storm, which was categorised as super cyclone at one point of time, has left the two eastern states on edge as it hollered on its destructive path over the Bay of Bengal.
 Intense rainfall was recorded in several areas of Puri, Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Ganjam, Ganjam, Bhadrak and Balasore districts since Tuesday.
 The rains and high-velocity winds will ebb away in Odisha by late Wednesday night by when the cyclone will likely have caused massive damage to standing crops, plantations and infrastructure, Mohapatra said.
 He said tidal surge of up to five metres could occur in North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts that could submerge areas in a radius of 15 km.
 The strong winds and rain could continue till tomorrow in West Bengal, he said.
 The turbulence will likely extend to Assam and Meghalaya, triggering heavy to very heavy rain on Thursday.

Kelly tipped the scale against science, common sense and the rule of law.
 If Karofsky had been on the high court, we are reasonably certain that the vote would have been 4-3 in favor of maintaining the emergency order. So it was an accident of timing, and the hyper-partisanship of Kelly and his cronies — as opposed to a thoughtful consideration of the law or a practical consideration of the science regarding the spread of the virus — that led to the upending of the governor's order.
 The majority decision was so convoluted that even its author, Chief Justice Roggensack, rejected efforts to maintain public safety and at least a measure of order while at the same time acknowledging "the concerns raised by COVID-19 and the possibility of throwing the state into chaos." Roggensack rejected a delay in enforcement of the decision in the majority decision and then wrote in a concurrence that she "would stay future actions to enforce our decision until May 20, 2020."

FLIPPIN – A walleye that could top 9 pounds was all that was keeping Roger Pyzocha from claiming catches in all eight of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission’s Master Angler Program categories, but it was proving elusive these past couple of years. Finally, after a few near misses on the weight scale with 8-pounders, Pyzocha recently landed a 9.2-pound walleye on Bull Shoals Lake to reach a goal he’d set out to achieve seven years ago.
 “I didn’t bring my cooler, I had to wait for my wife to come home, it was late and dark out when we finally got it home and we didn’t take the picture that night, but I weighed it the next day,” Pyzocha said, noting in the photographs that by the following day the fish had discolored. He forwarded the necessary paperwork and photos on the walleye, as well as a crappie that qualified for a Master Angler pin, to the AGFC late last week.
 And, though he had not seen the paperwork, Ben Batten, chief of the AGFC’s Fisheries Division, said Pyzocha’s achievement was impressive. The AGFC’s Sarah Baxter, Master Angler Program coordinator, said that, according to her records, Pyzocha is the first person to catch a qualifying fish in all eight categories. She said one other person has caught fish in seven categories and a few others have placed in six categories. Also, her records show that, before these last two qualifiers, Pyzocha had 37 total qualifying fish, far and away the most in Arkansas.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our lives and country as no other event has in recent history.
   
 Health care providers met the virus head on to care for those infected. Manufacturers pivoted their production lines to help provide the much need protection products and medical supplies. Other companies found new ways to provide goods and services. All acted without hesitation, amid a cloud of unclear and shifting rules and requirements placed on businesses, because it was for the good of our country and fellow Americans.
   
 While our country currently faces a health crisis in its battle against COVID-19, an economic crisis also has gripped our lives, largely because of government-issued orders that closed or restricted businesses and forced millions of Americans out of work.
   
 Cautiously, Kansas and other states are beginning to reopen their economies. During Gov. Laura Kelly's Phase 1 of her reopen plan, the state's business community proved its commitment to reopening and to safely bringing back their employees and serving their customers.
   
 There is no doubt it is in the best interests of businesses to keep their customers and employees safe. Unfortunately, it has become clear there are those who seek to penalize businesses with frivolous lawsuits.
   
 Current liability laws cover some aspects of COVID-19. At issue, however, is the lack of consistent expectations of what defines sufficient safeguards businesses should follow. Each day seems to bring new government guidelines. Don't wear masks. Everyone wears masks. Everyone closes. Some can open. Changing timelines to open, etc.
   
 The Kansas business community supports liability protection that uses government guidance to define the standard of care and provide some certainty that if companies follow the applicable guidance at the time, they will not be liable.
   
 Medical liability protection, premise liability protection and product liability protect are all crucial elements to this vital legislation.
   
 We ask the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Kelly to support the state's businesses and workers by passing targeted, commonsense reforms to protect against abuses of the legal system that would punish businesses who are working tirelessly to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and who are opening their doors after being shuttered by government orders.
   
 Companies that act in good faith to protect employees and follow available guidelines should not be exposed to costly legal fees for trying to do the right thing. Conversely, providing businesses with targeted and limited liability protections is not the same thing as shielding companies from liability for bad acts. We do not seek reforms that would protect businesses that operate in reckless or intentional disregard of available guidance.
   
 The Kansas business community is ready to get the Kansas economy growing again. Those businesses who carefully adhere to government guidelines and regulations for the safety of their employees, vendors and customers should not be subjected to the threat of frivolous lawsuits. This commonsense legislation is vital to Kansas economic recovery.

PITTSBURG -- Industrial hemp has seen rapid growth in Kansas since becoming legal in recent years, but could soon be given an even greater boost in the southeast corner of the state.
   
 The Pittsburg City Commission weighed the pros and cons last week of providing support to a new business that is looking to bring cannabidiol (CBD) processing to town, before ultimately holding off on making a decision about whether to help finance the operation.
   
 "In light of our current economic climate, it's nice that we're still bringing projects where people are wanting to start new businesses and create new jobs here in Pittsburg and Crawford County," said Blake Benson, director of economic development.
   
 CBD is a chemical that can be extracted from Cannabis sativa, otherwise known as hemp, which when grown differently with a focus on producing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is also known as marijuana.
   
 "CBD is non-psychoactive, unlike its cousin THC," said Colby Terlip, who grew up in Frontenac and owns Sunflower Hemp Co., in his presentation.
   
 Kansas has legalized hemp cultivation in recent years, first through a pilot program that began last year, and is now moving toward a commercial program, and while some of the state's hemp growing has been to produce fiber from the plant, much of it has focused on CBD production.
   
 Sunflower Hemp is investing about $1 million to get its operation up and running. Terlip aims to establish a 20,000-square-foot Good Manufacturing Practice-certified facility on North Rotary Terrace in Pittsburg, initially for refining crude CBD oil into such extracts as tinctures and topical applications.
   
 He said his facility will be able to comply with current federal, state and local regulations and he is prepared to comply with even further requirements that could soon be put in place.
   
 Terlip said his facility could also help area farmers interested in growing hemp.
   
 City Manager Daron Hall said the nature of Terlip's business probably had an effect on the discussion city officials were having about whether they should support it.
   
 "Obviously what we're all talking about is the subject matter," Hall said. "If Colby was making balloon animals, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation."
   
 The assistance from the city that Terlip is specifically seeking is a $110,000 grant, which would pay for a fire safety sprinkler system that the city requires for a facility the size of Sunflower Hemp, as well as other safety equipment, such as laboratory fume hoods and fire safety storage cabinets.
   
 Although Terlip is hoping to get his business up and running by June, several commissioners said they weren't comfortable making a decision and asked him to present to the EDAC again before approving city funding for the project.
