The Fairfield School Board approved attendance agreements, hired an administrative assistant and approved the salary negotiated with the business manager/clerk during its Sept. 14 board meeting.
 The Fairfield school district accepted 75 students from out-of-district in kindergarten through 12th grade for the 2020-21 school year. Superintendent Dustin Gordon said this is down slightly from last year but is in the ballpark for the five-year average. He said in 2019-20 the district had 82 students from out-of-district and 62 the previous year.
 “This speaks highly of the school district and the staff for the students and their families who make the choice to attend Fairfield Public Schools,” Gordon said.

"I've watched a few of their games, I was at their game against Bristol City on Sunday - I went and watched that one.
 "I know exactly how I think they will set up, their personnel could vary sort of slightly.
 "They're a decent side, and a big physical team - I think they have about eight six-footers in their team.
 "But equally, they've got some quality in there as well
 "They've added and spent money to bring the likes of Steven Fletcher, James Chester and guys like that in
 "They will be a strong outfit."
 Stoke was the venue for one of Scott Sinclair's first away trips as a PNE player last season.
 Having got off the mark last weekend at Norwich, the winger is looking to build on that as well as an impressive team performance.
 "The games are coming so fast, you have to prepare right and keep yourself fit," he said. "We should've beat Norwich but we need to move on from that and make sure we're prepared for Stoke.
 "I always find it is a physical battle against Stoke - you know they're going to have some good players and that it's going to be a fight.
 "We go into every game wanting to win and if we can get the three points on Saturday, we'll go from there having taken four points from two.
 "But obviously it's going to be a tough game, like every game is.
 "They're going to come here, they're going to battle, fight, and we've got to match that."

THELMA CHRISTINA HAYNES, age 91, passed away peacefully on September 21, surrounded by her family. She was born and raised in Charleston, W.Va., and lived in Cross Lanes since 1956. After a life of unfaltering devotion to her family, and as a faithful servant to the Lord, she always knew she would remain on earth until He was ready for her in Heaven.
 Thelma grew up on Charleston's West Side and graduated from Stonewall Jackson High School in 1947. She was a member of the planning committee for her class reunions for the past few decades. Later in adulthood, she attended West Virginia State College, studying elementary education.
 Her teenage years were filled with memories of working at her family's West Side grocery store (Smith's) on Maple Street and her early adult years working at Stone & Thomas (jewelry department) and Columbia Gas Transmission (records department). After her husband's death in 1971, she became a kindergarten teacher's aide for 18 years at Cross Lanes Elementary School, where she formed lifelong friendships with fellow teachers Carolyn Burton McCallister and Bobbi Hannah. Nearly every month until this year, they enjoyed going out to lunch together.
 During her teaching years, she became a part-time real estate agent. After retiring from teaching, she became a full-time Realtor and found tremendous success with many agencies, including Olde English Realty, Town and Country, Dobbins-Fisher-Pittman, Old Colony, Cornerstone Realty, and Real Estate Central, from where she ultimately retired in 2013 at the age of 84.
 In 2016 through March 2020, she was a participant in a respite program for caregivers offered by Kanawha Valley Senior Services at the former Tiskelwah Elementary School. The staff and volunteers at the program provided unconditional kindness, love, and support during Thelma's time there and kept her mentally engaged and physically active every weekday, which in turn gave family caregivers immeasurable peace of mind.
 For several years prior to 2016, she was a "foster grandparent" with United Way of Central West Virginia and was assigned to Nitro Elementary. She was a decades-long member of the Cross Lanes Woman's Club, enjoyed volunteering in the community to help children and families in need, delivered Christmas food baskets organized by Cross Lanes United Methodist Church, participated in Read Aloud programs, among numerous other community activities. During her teaching years, she was the chief organizer of the annual Cross Lanes Elementary School Carnival and a softball coach for various girls' teams in Cross Lanes.

They call it “medical marijuana” and appeal to people’s natural concern for the sick.
 Who could be against helping the sick? Well, no one, of course. That’s why it is all BIG MARIJUANA ever talks about, but the U.S. Surgeon General has stated there is no such thing as “medical marijuana” and emphasizes that it’s a “dangerous drug.”
 And here is more you need to know...
 Initiative 65 inserts marijuana permanently in our State Constitution. The Constitution rarely changes and is beyond the reach of the governor and legislature to regulate. In other words, it will take another statewide referendum to fix any oversights in Initiative 65. And there are plenty of problems.
 Initiative 65 would empower an un-elected group of 11 Mississippians to run this new industry with unprecedented taxing, spending and regulatory authority inconsistent with our system of government and not answerable to the State Legislature or any elected official.
 Doctors would be able to give Mississippians the legal right to smoke five ounces of marijuana per month. That translates to about 10 joints per day or 300 per month. Whoa!
 Think of the impact on our workforce, driving safety and young people.
 Physicians could certify patients with a broad array of medical conditions to use marijuana, including “pain”. It’s a mighty slippery slope other states have already slid down. Anyone, including teenagers, with a headache could be legally allowed to smoke marijuana.
 Mississippi needs to take a cautious and wise approach to marijuana. Adding it to our State Constitution is neither.
 Studies have shown that marijuana use negatively affects individuals’ processing speed, reasoning, executive function and memory. Furthermore, studies confirm young people who regularly use marijuana under the age of 25 lose measurable cognitive abilities permanently.
 They claim this is safe and healthy. It’s a lie from BIG MARIJUANA just like the lies BIG TOBACCO used to tell us.
 Initiative 65 is the wrong approach. If you think it’s time for “medical marijuana”, push to pass it through the legislature in 2021, but please don’t vote to add it to our State Constitution where not even an Act of Congress can change it.
 It's going to take a grassroots effort to beat back BIG MARIJUANA's millions of dollars to pass Initiative 65. We will have to win this campaign the old- fashioned way. We can do it! Visit www.MississippiHorizon.org to join the effort in preventing BIG MARIJUANA from permanently damaging Mississippi.
