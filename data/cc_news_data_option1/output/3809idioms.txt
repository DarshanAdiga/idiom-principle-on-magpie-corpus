North America is expected to display a strong growth on the back of increasing trend of homecare services combined with favorable healthcare reimbursement policies across the region. Further, the Europe market for nebulizers is anticipated to induce a budding growth on the back of growing number of smokers and rising geriatric population across the region. Asia Pacific is attributed to boost the nebulizers market during the forecast period on account of rising level of environmental pollution around the countries such as India, China and others accompanied with increased COPD incidences and significant rise in the percentage of population suffering from pulmonary diseases across the region.

“A really significant amount of people who call us are actually friends and family members saying, ‘I really want to get this person help,’” Moran said. “Other than that, a majority of our calls are the people themselves who are calling for help, and they’re usually at a point where they’re physically sick or desperately trying not to use drugs.”
 This phone line also allows people to speak with another person about their troubles, Moran said, because sometimes they just need an outlet to tell their story. This could also help the call center representative know what resource an individual needs, so they can best get them to the right place.
 “We’re available 24/7, call, text or chat, and when people call us, we get them immediately into some type of help,” Moran said. “We have a whole range, we have over 1,000 resources. Often people will say they want to go into detox, and if that’s what they need, we can usually get them in within 24 hours.”
 Moran and Hammond also said First Choice Resources is working on a hotline for youth that will provide resources relating to behavioral and mental health, rather than addiction aid.
 “Help 4 WV is currently working on an expansion that will include a children’s crisis component to it,” Hammond said. “It will be a little different than the Help 4 WV line, in that there will be a bit less focus on substance use and more focus on behavioral and mental health.”
 Although First Choice Services provides call lines for many different issues, Hammond said she doesn’t want people in need to be intimidated by all the options, and that the Help 4 WV number serves different problems.
 “It will just be great for there to be a central number to call that can connect people with whatever resources they are needing,” Hammond said. “It’s just an emotional strength line, so for anyone who is feeling down, depressed, stressed out, feels they need to talk to someone or that it may benefit them, they can call.”
 As a recovering addict herself, Hammond said the stigma some people associate with the issue can also be a roadblock for people who want to seek help, but she has seen some progress over the years of that stigma going away. She said the lessening of the stigma has coincided with the growth of recovery programs aimed at helping people through addiction, which makes the Help 4 WV line more helpful than ever.
 “I do think there is progress being made, and I think some people gained some understanding of it,” Hammond said. “But it’s always going to be one of those things that’s very hard to understand if they haven’t experienced it themselves.
 “But there’s a lot of things that haven’t changed, and that’s the disease of addiction and programs that have been around for a very long time.”

The Haitian American population in Sussex County, which is growing rapidly, has been on the front lines of the COVID-19 epidemic in Delaware.      “We lost so many Haitians,” said Nadya Julien, a Haitian-born nurse practitioner who owns Tabitha Medical Care in Laurel. “It was sad.”      Ms. Julien, who came to the United States 21 years ago and now works closely with Sussex County’s Haitian Creole-speaking population, said that five people she cared for at her practice have died from the virus.      “We probably lost more than 15 to 20 Haitians” at the facility overall, she said. “A lot of them were critically ill, on the ventilators.”      Pastor Elveus Solvens of the Milford Haitian Church of the Nazarene said six people in his congregation had contracted the virus, but luckily, they all survived.      “Most or all Haitians work in the chicken plants,” he said of the community in Sussex County. “During COVID-19, the chicken plants couldn’t close. … I think this is one reason they were affected.”      Ms. Julien estimated that 60% of working-age Haitian community members are employed in the poultry industry.      Emanie Dorival, another Haitian-born nurse practitioner who came to the U.S. in 1990, said many in the community were infected at work. Ms. Dorival’s clinic, Ephphatha Medical Care Services in Seaford, which opened in 2018, is focused in part on the Haitian Creole-speaking community.      “I would say a good 70% of the Haitians who were working in the chicken plants were affected by COVID because they tested positive,” she said.      But it’s hard to know how many Haitians in Sussex County have contracted or died from the virus. In fact, it’s hard to know how many people of Haitian descent there are in Sussex County in the first place.      “While (the Delaware Division of Public Health) tracks race/ethnicity, I don’t believe we track case data by country of descent,” said Jen Brestel, the DPH’s media relations coordinator.      This means that there is no data on how Haitian Americans in Delaware have been impacted by COVID-19, as they get lumped into the broader “non-Hispanic Black” category.      “When they test, they cannot differentiate African American and Haitian because there’s no other question there,” Ms. Julien said.      She said community leaders have been lobbying the government to count the Haitian community more effectively in the census.      “If we’re lumped together with the African Americans or other Blacks, you’re not truly going to know how many Haitians are here,” Ms. Julien said. “That’s why we cannot really give an estimate on how many are here. We just know there’s an increase.”      Pastor Solvens said the traditional Haitian attitude toward health care is very different from the American one, leading many to not seek treatment initially.      “We had a lot of people who got sick, but in our culture, when people get sick like that, they don’t want to go immediately to the hospital,” he said. “Sometimes, they want to stay home to see what they can do naturally.”      The language barrier also discourages many Haitian Creole speakers from seeking out treatment, as health professionals who speak that language are few and far between in many places.      “At one point, I can say at (TidalHealth) Nanticoke, you could see the whole range of the COVID floor was Haitian,” Ms. Julien said. “It was because of the language barrier.”      Pastor Solvens said his church has done a lot of work to educate the Haitian community in Milford.      “I have had several online conferences, just to inform them about COVID-19, to make sure they take care of themselves (and) they take all the precautions,” he said. “We try to give them the information.”      But he said there’s always more work to do.      “We do our best to translate things, like to make sure the information is available in Creole for them, but it’s never enough,” he said.      Haitian Creole-speaking medical professionals, like Ms. Julien and Ms. Dorival, have also taken on an important role in educating the community about the virus.      “As the leaders of the community, we’ve continued to inform them. We don’t want them to become complacent about it,” Ms. Dorival said.      “Once COVID started to really hit, I was affected,” Ms. Julien said. “I got it from one of my patients. I was very sick in the hospital.”      Once she healed, she began a “campaign of education.”      “I do presentations via Facebook Live and also through the churches on Zoom and educate them as far as prevention,” Ms. Julien said.

Nebraska Bucks and Bulls: The Greatest Stories of Hunting Whitetail, Mule Deer and Elk in the Cornhusker State is scheduled to hit bookstores Oct. 1 via UNL Press, but Helmer has already done signed copies at Chapter's Books and Gifts in Seward and at Barnes & Noble Bookstore in Lincoln.
 Helmer is an official scorer with the Boone and Crocket Club and used the records book, as well as records available at Game and Parks Commission in Lincoln, to get contact information for those he was interested in contacting for the book. What resulted is 68 chapters spread over 350 pages of hunting stories dating back to Nebraska's first organized hunt in 1945.
 Researching that story was one of many rewards for Helmer through the process. He passed by a mule deer head in the Game and Parks building dozens of times before stopping to read the plaque attached. The son of the man who shot that deer donated it. So Helmer contacted the son, who lived in Massachusetts. Through those conversations he discovered RA Wirz, who grew up near Halsey, shot the record mule deer in the first hunt contained to Halsey National Forest.
 “RA went out that morning and ended up shooting a really nice buck in 1945,” Helmer said.
 In addition to record books at Game and Parks, Helmer used online databases, social media, obituaries and word of mouth. He set up the NEGreatestBucksBulls Facebook page so people could get in touch with him and so he could get word out about the project.

HULL -- Residents and visitors are being asked to give comments on a draft open space and recreation plan for Hull, which will help guide the town in future land acquisitions, steer Community Preservation Act projects and aid in securing grants.
 The Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which is helping to craft the plan, set up a guided survey called a "virtual open house," for residents and nonresidents to give comments on the plan.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 In 2018, the town received a $26,680 grant to develop a new plan, which towns are encouraged to write every seven years. The last time Hull made a new plan was 20 years ago in 2000, said Courtney Lewis, regional land use planner.
 The process of drafting a new plan, getting public input and incorporating those comments started last September with a community forum.
 "We took the information from that meeting, compiled a community survey and allowed residents to give responses to that," Lewis said.
 They received about 400 responses to the survey from residents and visitors and incorporated those comments and concerns into the current draft.
 "We decided on a number of action items that fell under each specific goal under the plan," Lewis said.
 Four themes came out of the initial responses -- residents want a new a skate park, for Fort Revere to be restored, more Americans with Disabilities Act access to the town-owned portions of Nantasket Beach and the conservation and acquisition of open space.
 "The youth are really wanting a skate park," Lewis said, and most want it to be near the Paragon Boardwalk.
 The initial survey also made a lot of residents realize there are facilities and open spaces in the town they never knew about, which led to one more desire -- signage and promotion of the open and public spaces in Hull, Lewis said.
 There are currently six goals in the draft plan: beautify entry points and main roadways; preserve and protect natural resource areas; apply for grants to enhance the town's resources; acquire open space and create development regulations to protect recreational needs; improve accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities; and maintain, enhance and expand Hull's active recreation facilities and programing.

And we replaced them, those four vessels, with an average age of 14 years with four new vessels, three of them already delivered in spite of the very difficult circumstances that seafarers have been operating. So I need, first of all to thank our associated seafarers for their efforts, so the people there, but also our new building team and operation team for making sure that we were able to deliver best ships on time, maintain our very accretive charters.

"To put that into perspective, normally for a fire that size we'd have at least double or triple that number of firefighters," Mitchell said. At the time, many Southern California ground crews and a fleet of retardant- and water-dropping aircraft were assigned to multiple record-breaking blazes in the northern part of the state.
 By the time staffing was ramped up, flames had found their way deep into inaccessible forest. Embers floated across mountain ridges, igniting towering trees and creating an expanding wall of fire.
 "A lot of that old growth hadn't seen fire in 40 or 50 years. The fire had a lot of places to go," Mitchell said. The blaze had more than doubled in size over the past week to 170 square miles (440 square kilometers).
 As of Monday, the fire was still advancing at one to two miles (1.6 to 3.2 kilometers) per hour at times and threatened the desert town of Pearblossom after burning into the Antelope Valley foothill area, across the San Gabriel Mountains from Los Angeles.
 The blaze has destroyed or damaged at least 29 homes and other buildings, with the toll rising to perhaps 85 when damage assessment teams can complete their work this week, authorities said.
 Cheryl Poindexter lost her desert home.
 "That fire came over the hill so hard and fast that I turned around and I barely got my eight dogs and my two parrots out," Poindexter told ABC7. "You can see everything is ash."

Gabriel wasn’t willing to go down without a last fight. He reached DeVos and said, “We need to get a G4 in the air as soon as possible!” Armato was already in Atlanta with his girlfriend, the Olympic beach volleyball star Holly McPeak. DeVos hedged a bit at the request. Earlier that day he’d told an Orlando Sentinel reporter, “If they are trying to squeeze another million or two out of this, then the Lakers can pay it.” He was sick and tired of the whole back-and-forth. But, with DeVos’ grudging blessing, Gabriel and Bob Vander Weide, the team president, made the 1-hour, 25-minute flight to the Peach State and found Armato in the sand by a lake, decked out in T-shirt and sweatpants and collecting the errant balls his love hammered over a net. Gabriel was wearing a suit and tie. He walked across the beachy surface and told Armato the Magic would pay Shaquille O’Neal $115 million. The agent listened but didn’t really listen. It was too late.

Lewis and Clark identified almost 150 plants new to science on their expedition, many in Idaho. I will pick a few to represent those contributions, beginning with our state flower, Lewis’ Mock orange or Lewis’s Syringa (Philadelphus Lewisii.) The Latin name honors Meriwether Lewis, who discovered the plant in early May 1806 on the return trip, shortly after the corps had reached the Clearwater. This native shrub is highly adaptable and in late spring produces a profusion of white flowers with a slight orange fragrance. The bloom lasts for several weeks. The flower was chosen as Idaho’s state flower as it had been included on the Great Seal of the State of Idaho since the 1890s, where it was depicted, sprouting at the feet of a goddess. Lewis’s mock orange had also represented the state at the 1893 World Fair floral display in Chicago.

But in its heavy emphasis on the UDHR – and its relative neglect of subsequent treaties -- the commission seems to want to have it both ways. It offers a “pick and choose” approach that on the one hand emphasizes state consent, national sovereignty, and positive law. On the other hand, the commission regularly appeals to “unalienable rights” beyond positive law as it sees them, and it invokes its own particular stance on the “original understanding” of the UDHR as a limiting touchstone for “new rights.” The commission repeatedly characterizes rights to which it is less sympathetic as “contestable policy preferences” or “divisive policy issues,” and it seems to prefer a process of “bargaining” to a more transparent and forthright discussion of rights claims.

However in contrast to “Misplaced in Translation” or Coppola’s different finest movie, “Someplace” (which was like “Entourage” directed by Agnès Varda), there’s no additional degree of thriller to this one.

A much-needed weekend getaway for my husband John and myself confirmed some mysterious facts I instinctively already knew. The following is the crazy account of our weekend.
 We set up camp on the Clinch River at a friend’s property vacation home. Our small vintage Serro Scotty camper looked even more appealing next to the backdrop of the babbling brook coming down from the hillside rocks. And we even set up a massage table outside next to this beautiful water feature. Afterall, this weekend was all about relaxation. No other people around us and no cell phone service or internet to distract us from the peace and quiet.
 I guess this would be a good time to tell you that our English Mastiff dog, Bob, came with us. During the day Bob played in the creek or hung out by our side and at night he slept with us in our camper. Or I should say he slept with us in our tiny bed in the camper. Why not? For the last eight years he has slept with us every night at home in our king-sized bed.
 On the first night we managed to all squeeze together and make it work. Which was a miracle. After all, the bed in the camper is not even a full-size bed. I am a big woman; my husband is a full-grown man and our Bob weighs in at a whopping 160 pounds. Yet we fit.
 We woke up, cooked an amazing breakfast, gave each other massages, and played Scrabble. The score at the end of the first game was an exact tie with 222. It came down to having to subtract the tiles we each had left behind. I won that game by six points. Second game yielded similar results, but this time John won by six points. Talk about being evenly matched.
 We then went for a canoe ride together leaving Bob secured in our friend’s cabin home. The water was calm, and we spent two hours paddling peacefully down the middle of the beautiful Clinch River. As we paddled, we talked about how in sync we were in the canoe and in life. So evenly matched that even when playing games, our scores were the same.
 When we returned to the campsite, Bob greeted us by the camper, he was frantic. Turned out he had jumped through the window of our friends’ home and leaped over a gated deck, ran to the campsite and was in a complete panic looking for us. Seriously, he was completely out of breath and disheveled. I can’t imagine what he thought was happening. No more canoe rides for us.
 The second night we were not as blessed in the sleep department as we were the first night. Bob was relentless and was taking up so much space that my husband declared he was leaving the camper to go sleep on the couch of our friend’s home.
 When Bob woke up and realized John was gone, he got upset scratching on the camper door to be let out. I went to let him out, but he would not leave the camper until I went with him. Bob then led me straight to our friend’s vacation home and to John, who laid asleep on the couch.
 Thinking he just wanted to be with John, I left to go back to sleep in the camper. Within an hour, John and Bob were coming back in the camper. My husband, declaring as he opened the door, “We’re back! Bob would not let me sleep. He kept pulling my arm until he led me back to the camper.”
 They both crawled back in bed. Bob was finally content and slept like a baby. Us not so much.
 Truth be told, I have always known that John and I were meant to be together. Everyone who knows us knows that it is just a simple fact of life. Even John’s mother knew it before he and I ever met. She would tell me over and over again how I needed to meet her son and how perfect we would be for each other. But now even our dog Bob knows it.
 He simply would not let us be separated, not even for one night.
 Actually, when I think about it, Bob is as much a part of our relationship as we are. After all, he does sleep in our bed with us and he dictates what we can and cannot do. Furthermore, we spend more money on him than we do ourselves.
 Wait a minute. When I first started writing this column it was supposed to be about how evenly yoked John and I are. In fact, the original name of this story was going to be “Evenly Yoked” but as I have written it, I realize this is not the story I intended.
 Yes, this is a story about love, but it is not as much a story about John and I, as it is about Bob and us. Can a couple be soul mates with a dog?
 This is Bob’s love story. This is a dog’s tale. Life is mysterious.

I’ve been a Rashida Jones fan ever since “I Love You, Man” (2009), and that is the full-scale film function she deserves. She makes Laura keen, cautious, hilariously affected person (as when she’s enduring the psychobabble monologues of her school-parent chum, performed by Jenny Slate), and quietly teetering on the fringe of her world falling aside. Via all of it, her journey to redemption is pushed by the query: Is Laura’s father, in his flawed rapscallion manner, all-seeing? Or does he see what he needs to see? “Misplaced in Translation” was a few soul-to-soul connection that sidestepped romance. “On the Rocks” _is_ a romance, by which a father and daughter be taught who they're by the lens of what love and belief are actually about. The film cruises ahead on all of Coppola’s presents, but it’s simply adequate to make you would like it had been main.

The most prominent inclusion of yuri tropes in the series is lead characters Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami. Everything from the story beats of their developing romance to their character designs is directly copied from or heavily influenced by common yuri material. The standard narrative of the genre, which I call the “girl-meets-girl” story, details the courtship of two women. These works always begin with the two leads meeting and one falling for the other. After a fair bit of heartache, the affection becomes mutual, and the characters finally express their love through a soulful gaze into each other's eyes, a triumphant kiss, or, in more recent yuri titles, sexual intimacy. Yuu and Touko's courtship follows this format almost to a T. Their story is not only a near-textbook example of the “girl-meets-girl” structure, but various major and minor elements and events within it feature yuri tropes.

“Another factor that may account for Arizona’s lower percentage of instructional spending is class size,’’ she reported. In Arizona, there are an average of 18.4 students per teacher, compared with 16 in the rest of the country.
 Molera does not dispute Perry’s findings. But he insists that there are efficiencies that can be had to put more of each dollar in the classroom before simply putting more cash in the pipeline.
 He also said there are other alternatives, such as a proposal by several Republican legislators to increase the current 0.6-cent sales tax for education to a full penny.
 Legislative budget analysts said that could raise an extra nearly $473 million a year, versus the $940 million predicted by proponents of Proposition 208.
 But that idea, which has been around since last year, never got out of the Legislature, much less became a ballot proposal as an alternative to the income tax hike. That leaves Prop 208 as the only take-it-or-leave-it proposal for voters.
 Lujan defends the income tax proposal as being the fairest, given a series of tax cuts by state lawmakers in the past decade that he said have largely benefited business and the more wealthy. And this is designed so that 96% of Arizonans won’t be affected.
 This proposal relies on Arizona’s tiered income tax system.
 Everyone pays the same rate on the same earnings. So any individual is taxed at 2.59% for the first $26,500 of earnings, 3.34% on everything between that and $53,000, 4.17%, on income of $53,001 through $159,000, and 4.5% on everything over that.
 Proposition 208 would add a 3.5% surcharge on individual earnings above $250,000. All figures are double for married couples filing jointly.
 Put another way, a married couple earning $650,000 would pay no additional taxes on the first $500,000. But the rate on the balance would go from $6,750 to $12,000.
 Foes of the initiative said that would give Arizona one of the highest top tax brackets in the nation. But Lujan said that, given the tiered tax system, the overall burden on that couple making $650,000 a year would still be less than in 34 other states.
 As to targeting the wealthy to bear the burden, Lujan said that’s fair given other taxes, with sales tax hikes disproportionately affecting those with lower incomes. But he has conceded that having a tax hike that affects perhaps only 4% of Arizonans is more likely to be politically palatable at the polls than one which hits more.
 That, in turn, has led to dueling economic reports.
 One prepared by the Goldwater Institute says the higher top tax rate will make it harder to recruit new businesses into Arizona and result in “out-migration of high-income individuals’’ to states with lower taxes. Overall, its economic modeling predicts 124,000 jobs will be lost within 10 years, with a reduction of $120 million a year in state tax collections.
 It also questions whether the promised revenues will be there, saying that income tax collections on the most wealthy are the most volatile.
 But Enrique Lopezlira, an economics professor at Grand Canyon College, looks at the issue from a different perspective. That is based at least in part that, after accounting for inflation and student growth, prior cuts in education funding have resulted in the state spending less per student now than it did a decade ago.
 He predicts that restoring funds cut from public schools actually would grow the Arizona economy.
 On a deeper philosophical level, Lopezlira said the cuts in education funding were not due to the recession but instead part of an “ideological shift’’ to reduce investment in public education and enact tax cuts. That included a 30% reduction in corporate income tax rates.
 More generically, Prop 208 opponents argue that the initiative, in raising rates on individual income taxes, would harm small businesses.
 That’s because many are organized not as corporations, where the taxes are paid by the business at corporate tax rates, but as sole proprietorships, partnerships and under a section of the Internal Revenue Code, all of which are situations where the business owes no taxes and all earnings are ascribed to the owner or owners. That, foes argue, makes the earnings subject to the higher taxes.
 Lujan does not dispute the point. But he noted that state income taxes are due on the net profits, after a business owner pays all costs of employees, utilities, supplies, equipment and other overhead.
 It is only what’s left as the net profits to the business owner, Lujan said, that is subject to individual income taxes. And he said any couple netting $500,000 a year after paying all the costs of their business operations probably can afford to pay some extra taxes for education.
 There’s one other point that may be of interest.
 Anything approved by the voters is protected against legislative repeal or alteration. The Arizona Constitution allows lawmakers to make changes only with a three-fourths vote and only if they “further the purpose’’ of the original measure.
 From Molera’s perspective, that’s a bad idea as it locks the measure – and the tax and spending plan – in place unless and until the issue goes back to voters.
 Lujan, however, sees that as a plus against legislative tinkering.

PEKIN -- The first five holes of Dawson Woll's round Saturday in the Dragon Classic boys golf tournament at Lick Creek Golf Course were a nightmare.
   
 Starting at No. 14 in a shotgun start, the Pekin senior shot par on No. 14, then 7 on No. 15, 10 on No. 16 with two shots into the woods, and 6 on No. 17 with a shot into the woods.
   
 Then came No. 18. Woll dropped four shots into the water and shot 14.
   
 "I'd never had a double-digit score on a hole in a competition until those holes," he said.
   
 Woll wasn't in a good place as he left the green at No. 18 and headed to the tee at No. 1 on Pekin's home course.
   
 "I thought I wasn't going to help my team, my front nine was going to be just as bad, and I wasn't going to break 100 for the round," he said.
   
 But help was on the way.
   
 First, Pekin athletic director Barry Gurvey gave Woll some words of encouragement. Then, Pekin coach Jeremy Crouch tried to get Woll back on track.
   
 They each told Woll he could indeed help his team.
   
 How? In the Dragon Classic, a team's score is determined by the best four of six scores on the front and back nines.
   
 "To be honest, I didn't know that," Woll said. "Coach Crouch told me I needed to get those bad holes out of my head, so I did. When I got to the tee at No. 1, I was thinking I was starting a new round."
   
 Woll began the front nine with a bogey and a birdie.
   
 Crouch caught up to Woll after Woll finished No. 8.
   
 "Coach Crouch asked me if I had figured things out, and I told him I was driving better and making some putts," Woll said. "Then he told me if I shot better than 44 on the front nine, I'd be one of our team's scores."
   
 Woll shot par at No. 9. His 41 on the front nine counted for the Dragons, who won their second consecutive Dragon Classic team championship.
   
 "Dawson really battled on the front nine," Crouch said. "When we talked at No. 1, I told him he had to let go what happened on the last five holes and start over.
   
 "That's the beauty of sports. You're always given opportunities to be challenged and rise to the occasion."
   
 The Dragon Classic is a two-day, 36-hole tournament. Woll played at Parkview Golf Course on Friday as an individual and shot 77 with six birdies. That earned him an opportunity to be in his team's lineup Saturday.
   
 The 77 turned out be a blessing and a curse.
   
 "I was in 12th place in the individual standings after my round Friday, and I set a goal of being in the top 20 for the tournament," Woll said. "But the pressure of doing that got to me. I can't let that happen again."
   
 After he finished the front nine Saturday at Lick Creek, Woll had some fun on his final holes of the day, No. 10 through No. 13.
   
 "I knew I couldn't help my team on the back nine, so I just enjoyed playing the holes," he said. "I shot some pars and bogeys."
   
 Woll ended up shooting 104 for the round.

Central trade unions, including the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), have said the three labour codes passed by Parliament on Wednesday are anti-worker, with the BMS saying the Industrial Relations Code could “adversely affect industrial peace.”
 BMS general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay said none of the objections raised by it and other trade unions as well as the pro-worker recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour were taken on board.
 “It is further tilted in favour of the employers and bureaucrats; and the last minute mutilations will adversely affect industrial peace in the country,” he said in a statement.
 ## ‘No discussion’
 Mr. Upadhyay said some important changes to labour laws were made without discussion, which was a violation of the International Labour Organisation’s 144 convention ratified by India. Among the changes he mentioned was exempting companies with up to 300 workers from standing orders, increasing it from the current law of 100. This would allow companies with up to 300 workers flexibility to hire and fire.
 “There is a clear attempt to diminish the role of trade unions. The danger of bureaucrats replacing Parliament is very much apparent in the IR Code, which may lead to constitutional issues. Even Supreme Court’s directions on constitutionality of some provisions are violated,” he said.
 The BMS national conference from October 2 to 4 would decide on the union’s “future course of action on the anti-worker provisions in the labour codes,” he said.
 Meanwhile, 10 Central trade unions — the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the All-India United Trade Union Centre, the Trade Union Coordination Committee, the Self Employed Women’s Association, the All- India Central Council of Trade Unions, the Labour Progressive Federation and the United Trade Union Congress — held protests against the codes and other labour-related policies of the government.
 CITU general secretary Tapan Sen said the three codes had been taken up in Parliament in a hurry.
 “These codes, now passed, will throw more than 74% of the industrial workers and 70% of industrial establishments in ‘hire and fire regime’ at the will of the employers; even formation of a trade union will be extremely difficult; will impose virtual ban on workers’ right to strike and even collectively agitate on their grievances and demands to mention a few,” he said.
 He said workers’ unions and farmers would protest on September 25 against the policies of the government.

The Kewanee Dist. 229 school board accepted the 2020-21 budget following a public hearing Monday, with a wary eye cast toward the future.
   
 Supt. Chris Sullens said the district, after the end of the fiscal year, has $9.8 million in reserves in its education fund, $2.2 million in its building and operations fund and $952,000 in the transportation fund.
   
 The district is expected to take in $18 million in tax revenues for the coming year for its education fund, with estimated expenditures totaling $17.9 million. The building fund will take in $2.7 million and spend $2.5 million, while the transportation is forecast to be in the red -- with $840,000 taken in and $913,000 budgeted. Sullens said the transportation shortfall is due to expected late state payments. He said the overall budget is balanced.
   
 Sullens said the district has recently upped its reserve levels at the recommendation of state education officials. He said districts used to be told to hold enough money back to ensure 30 days of operation -- but that recommendation, because of late state payments and other financial uncertainties district's face, has been raised to six months.
   
 "That's the new model that's being recommended," he said.
   
 And while the district hasn't felt the brunt of the financial slowdown just yet, Sullens said perilous scenarios affecting the district's bottom line do exist.
   
 "For one, payments from the state government are still behind," he said, "and we don't think we'll get all the payments that should be coming to us."
   
 The state, facing budget issues resulting from the slowdown in economic activity because of the pandemic, has already backtracked on its promise of additional funding through a new formula adopted two years ago. Under that formula, Dist. 229 schools received $1.3 million in the first round and $831,000 in the next.
   
 But instead of the promised $350 million annually to bring up the state's overall education funding levels, this year the legislature only approved about $2 million in new funding.
   
 Kewanee's 2020-21 budget does not reflect any of that new money and Sullens said trying to gauge next year is akin to looking into a crystal ball.
   
 "We're flatlined," the superintendent said, "Otherwise, we'd be in the position to receive more money. Part of the concern is that during the shutdown, overall tax revenues to Illinois were way down."
   
 Two things could change that, but Sullens said neither is a given.
   
 One is that the federal government, if Congress does approve a second stimulus package, earmarks funding specifically for states struggling under the financial weight of the pandemic response. But as of now, both sides are still negotiating a new stimulus deal, with Republicans flinching over more direct state funding support.
   
 The second development that could boost the state's revenue stream is the graduated income tax proposal -- called the "Fair Tax" by state Democrat leaders -- which is projected to bring in more money to the state.
   
 Whether either scenario happens is a mystery, Sullens said, though both could have significant impacts on the local school district.
   
 In the first round of federal funding, Kewanee schools received nearly $700,000 -- more than half of which was spent on computers, the added building cleaning expense and other school equipment.
   
 "Will the federal government step in? Will the voters pass the graduated income tax? Who knows?"

Yeah. There's always a combination. I think we are repurchasing debt. We must be one of the very few companies in our peer group who have maintained a continuous clean sheet with our banks, never having any discussions on our repayment schedules, to say the least. And that's why, as Paul said, we are seeing right now -- I think we are discussing now we're getting our debt very close to the all time lows of just above 100 basis points, between 100 and 150. And so that -- this is our priority; dividend to our shareholder and growth of the company. But as we were able to portray during the first six months, we were able to sell the older ships. And from the cash that we took out of those ships, we were able to order the new vessels. So I think that has been a very good arrangement and very straight to the company's strategy about how to replenish and modernize the fleet. I mean, we generated $30 million of free cash. We repaid debt out of the sales. And we used part of this cash for the new acquisitions.
