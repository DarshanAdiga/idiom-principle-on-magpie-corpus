"Lots of cricketers are 70, 80, they are on the last leg (of their lives), how long can they wait? Anyway, the pension that is given to cricketers amounts to .54% of the overall BCCI expenditure for a year. Even if you double it, it's 1.08%. We are not asking for much. Of the five [ICA members - Hitesh Majmudar, V Krishnaswamy, Yajurvindra Singh and Rajesh Nayyar are the others] at least listen to one, for god's sake."


  Malhotra made his grievance known to the wider world via the video, where he stressed that "unluckily", the ICA has been dependent on the BCCI and the Apex Council, which hasn't worked out too well for it. And that - the public expression of his disenchantment - ended up irking the four other members of the ICA, some of whom have since spoken to sections of the media asking for issues to be dealt with internally.


  In the video, Malhotra had said, "Last meeting of Apex Council was held long way back and because of coronavirus, yes, they are having difficulties - conference calls, Zoom, whatever - but the fact is that BCCI will have to take a call. It is not in the hands of ICA. ICA can only request and plead, and Apex Council is the one which will have to take the decision. Although there are two ICA members who are Apex Council members, they are in Apex Council because of ICA. And it little bit becomes their responsibility.


  "I know BCCI has a lot of things on their agenda, like Bihar Cricket Association, they are talking about domestic cricket, a whole lot of things. [But], I as ICA president, ICA as a whole, we are not really concerned about it. We are more concerned about what we are asked to do. And that is the duty of Apex Council, to deliver. I am saying again and again because we are getting a lot of questions, we are answerable to the stakeholders. We are really, really answerable. And ICA members, who are Apex Council members, are answerable to ICA. So it is a chain reaction. If nothing happens, they have every reason to be disappointed with the ICA. And ICA in turn might be disappointed with their Apex Council members. It's a fact."

  According to Malhotra, he has received messages from his four colleagues since then, and they have also sent him an email asking him to "follow the process". Majmudar has also been quoted by the _Indian Express_ as saying, "We don't want to take on anybody. We want to work for the benefit of cricketers, but we need to follow the process."


  "After the video, all hell broke loose. Four directors started writing… one of them wrote to me saying we can't fight a big organisation like the BCCI, look at what happened to Lalit Modi. I said where is the question of fighting? Where is the comparison between us and Lalit Modi," Malhotra said. "Then the four of them got together and fired an email to me. On top of that, one of the directors, I don't know who, released the email to the press. I was being outvoted on everything, but I was keeping quiet. But now they are saying don't go public, but they are leaking emails to the media.


  "Then they sent an apology to the BCCI without consulting me. For that video. I just wanted to know if you have sent an apology why didn't you inform me? Am I not a board member? I am the president. If the four of you discuss and decide, it's not done, it's taking things too far. So I have now gone public too. It's a democratic set-up, we are answerable to our stakeholders. What is the role of the president? Am I the president or the _chapraasi_ (servant)?"


  Malhotra said that he would next take his point of view to the stakeholders, the former cricketers who fall under the ICA's umbrella. "The Supreme Court ordered the BCCI to have an ICA, it was compulsory, and it was compulsory for them to give us funds, which they have done - they have given Rs 2 crore," he said. "We have Rs 1.35 crore in our account. No problem there. But it's become very dirty. Once you go public, you open the Pandora's Box. Hopefully we come to a compromise."


  "We have been shoved down the BCCI's throat. But whether they love us or hate us, we are here to stay. Whether anybody likes it or not, whether we can do our work or not, whether I am there or someone else, we are not under BCCI, we are not in conflict with BCCI. We are an independent entity."

THAT'S WHY SOMEONE LIKE TRUMP CAN TRY THINGS LIKE SENDING IN GOONS AS A CAMPAIGN TACTIC. Whoever can't see that is just plain blind! People have to stop the destructive protesting in an area like this, there's no two ways about it. Or those suburban swings are going to switch back to GOP downticket even if they don't vote for Trump. Anarchist protest is absolutely THE WRONG ANSWER!!! People are going to chose law and order every time if their other choice is framed as anarchist chaos and year zero. SISTER SOULJAH MOMENTS DESPERATELY NEEDED if you don't want Biden having to work with a GOP majority House and Senate and blue states going GOP in their legislatures and other local government.

Which brings us -- in this truncated history -- to the 1960s. The social revolution of that decade was the illegitimate child of progressive education and the affluent society. Thanks to the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, my own generation was able to smoke weed, skip class, and raise Cain -- all while on the family allowance. Somehow along the way, these products of indulgence decided that America didn't live up to their high standards of social justice. They rejected the principles of rugged individualism and free enterprise and substituted their socialist fantasies. The Vietnam War gave them the perfect foil to foment civil unrest and to enlist most of their generation into a war on "the establishment," which meant a war on law and order, a war on religion, a war on the nuclear family, and a war on authority in general. These were the godchildren of John Dewey: Question everything, respect nothing.

El Festival Internacional de Cine de Toronto (TIFF) abrirá su 45 edición el próximo 10 de septiembre con el estreno mundial de “American Utopia”, la versión cinematográfica del director estadounidense Spike Lee del musical de Broadway creado por el que fue líder de Talking Heads, David Byrne. Los organizadores de TIFF, que este año sólo proyectará 50 películas en vez de las más de 300 que habitualmente presenta debido a la pandemia de COVID-19, dijeron que todavía no está decidido si el estreno de “American Utopia“ podrá realizarse en un cine y que dependerá de la autorización de las autoridades canadienses y la evolución de la pandemia. Byrne, uno de los músicos más creativos de las últimas décadas en Estados Unidos y ganador de un Óscar por la música de “The Last Emperor“ (1987), protagonizó “American Utopia“ en el teatro Hudson de Nueva York de octubre de 2019 a febrero de 2020 interpretando con otros 11 artistas las canciones del álbum que lanzó en 2018 con el mismo título que el espectáculo. “American Utopia“ contiene canciones como “Once in a Lifetime“ y “Burning Down the House“, dos de las canciones más populares de Talking Heads, el grupo que Byrne creó en 1975 y lideró hasta su disolución en 1991. TIFF señaló este martes en un comunicado que el film de Spike Lee, (“Do the Right Thing“, 1989; “Malcom X“, 1992, “BlacKkKlansman“, 2018) documenta el espectáculo de Broadway creado por Byrne a la vez que plantea temas sociales y políticos. Joana Vicente, director ejecutiva y codirectora de TIFF, señaló que “este alegre film transporta a las audiencias a un viaje musical de apertura, optimismo, fe y humanidad. Esto es especialmente conmovedor en un tiempo de gran incertidumbre en todo el mundo. Estamos ansiosos de compartir el entusiasmo de la apertura con las audiencias”. Por su parte, Cameron Bailey, director artístico y codirector de TIFF, afirmó que “Spike Lee de alguna forma siempre ha estado exactamente en su momento y por delante de su tiempo. Con “American Utopia“ nos trae las canciones clásica de Byrne y alegre técnica escénica justo cuando lo necesitamos“. TIFF, uno de los festivales de cine más importantes del mundo y considerado como el preferido para estrenar películas con opciones a los Oscar, anunció en junio que celebrará su 45 edición del 10 al 19 de septiembre con proyecciones en autocines, alfombras rojas virtuales y un pequeño número de proyecciones en salas debido a la pandemia de COVID-19. TIFF también anunció que el 15 de septiembre concederá el Premio Homenaje a la actriz británica Kate Winslet, ganadora del Óscar a la mejor actriz en 2009 por “The Reader”, en una ceremonia virtual.
