Ci sono addirittura servizi che sono completamente attivi grazie al 100 per cento dei dipendenti che sta lavorando presso la propria abitazione. Penso, per esempio, all'Ufficio stampa (62 su 62). Le attività relative a Verifiche e certificazioni raggiungono il 95 per cento, la Toponomastica l'85 per cento. Nell'ufficio dell'Assemblea capitolina 179 su 214 sono in lavoro agile, presso la Scuola di formazione 25 su 26, alla Ragioneria generale 240 su 290, nel Dipartimento servizi educativi e scolastici 120 su 130, al Dipartimento sviluppo economico e attività produttive 200 su 243, nel municipio I sono 221 su 350, nel municipio IV sono 279 su 317, nel municipio X infine 226 su 450". De Santis sottolinea che i "numeri" sono "in continua e progressiva evoluzione. Per noi il lavoro agile è un processo dinamico, in sviluppo costante, da affinare e migliorare sempre. Sarà un volano che si evolverà nel tempo per la nostra amministrazione. È la nostra filosofia. In quest'ottica abbiamo lanciato un percorso partecipato - conclude l'assessore -, aperto a tutti i dipendenti che possono inviare, in una mail apposita, segnalazioni, suggerimenti e impressioni. Roma Capitale si configura così come un laboratorio di innovazione, semplificazione e crescita strutturale per la pubblica amministrazione". (Com)
