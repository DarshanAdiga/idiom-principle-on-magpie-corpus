 Tia Walker, 24, is a Teutoplis native living in Atwood, Tennessee with her fiancé Jed Phillips, 24, formerly of Effingham. The two are planning a wedding in Effingham on June 13, but the widespread virus has already put a damper on some wedding festivities.
 “So far we have had to postpone our wedding shower and our second round of engagement pictures, which were both suppose to be on April 11; it is tentatively rescheduled for May 30. Luckily, we got a round of engagement pictures done in September that I was able to use for our invitations,” Walker said.

“We got a request today about the piers, if we could open them up,” said county commission chairman Mike Browning. “We had some discussion back and forth and in light of everything there was not much reason to keep them closed.”
 Given the breadth of businesses and activities the governor’s order allows the public to engage in — which includes grocery shopping, outdoor exercise and takeout, delivery, drive-through or curbside food service — he said county commissioners could not come up with a reason to keep people off the piers.
 “With the beach being reopened, even if you can’t sit on the beach, it didn’t make much sense for people not to go on the pier,” Browning said.

Shelby Hinterscher owns Vayda Jane Bridal, a shop that specializes in bridal gowns, bridesmaids dresses and accessories. Hinterscher opened her storefront in December 2019 but has recently had to shut down because the business is consider to be non-essential by the state.
 Hinterscher said that thus far, there have been no issues with gowns and dresses being shipped in time other than a slower arrival for the dresses.
 “So far, we haven’t seen any major issues when it comes to shipping with bridal gowns or bridesmaids (dresses). Of course, it’s been slower to arrive, but everything is still arriving in a timely matter before the dress is needed, Hinterscher said. “Our designers have asked us to examine incoming orders for any weddings that have been postponed or if the wedding is next year to push out ship dates. That way they can focus on shipping orders that are needed for an earlier date since they have had to scale back their workforce significantly as well.”
 Hinterscher said because she has only been open for five months, a majority of her brides have September 2020 weddings, so dresses will be ready in time for those weddings. Some brides have May and summer weddings, but Hinterscher said all of those dresses have arrived or been accounted for during the shipping process.
 Hinterscher has still been able to connect with brides and bridesmaids through social media and email and phone calls. She said on her website, brides can save their favorite styles in a virtual “closet” so when the store opens back up, Hinterscher has a better idea of what the bride might be looking for on her appointment.
 “We have also been able to take payments and order bridesmaids dresses over the phone or via email. I have not done this with bridal only because I don’t want them to lose that experience. It’s so important for a bride to be in the dress, feel the fabric, feel the comfort and experience that ‘yes’ moment,” Hinterscher said.
 Another bridal store in Effingham, Wild Rose Bridal, is also keeping in contact with brides, bridesmaids and mothers of the brides and grooms through social media. According to the shop’s Facebook page, as of the end of March, bridal gowns will ship withing 15 to 20 weeks while bridesmaids dresses will ship in mid- to late June and mothers’ dresses depend on the style.
 Tanya Pedersen is the owner of Design Pro located in the Lincolnland Building where Pedersen creates wedding stationery, favors and more. Pedersen said she, too, is still able to connect with clients through email and phone calls, but business has been slower because many weddings and events have been canceled.
 “Unfortunately, a lot of the couples I’m working with have had to postpone their weddings to a date later this year. Many of them had already sent out their wedding invitations and had ordered wedding favors such as can coolers and cups with their original wedding date printed on them,” Pedersen said. “Some couples are really struggling with making the decision about whether or not to postpone. We don’t know when all of this will end and when it will be safe to celebrate again, so it’s been really hard for couples with weddings this summer to know what to do regarding their weddings.”
 For now, Pedersen said she is working from home but has been able to drop off orders at her office for couples to safely pick up and is also offering reprint deals for weddings affected by the pandemic. The reprint deals are also extended to couples who ordered invitations from a source other than Design Pro.
 Pedersen’s advice to couples who are struggling with whether or not to postpone their wedding is to hold out as long as possible and to create a backup plan by checking with all vendors and venues for later available dates.
 “I know it might be hard to get all of your original vendors, but our wedding community is the best. I know other vendors are doing everything in their power to make things work. You might have to get creative by having a Friday or a Sunday wedding, but when all of this is over, everyone will be so excited to be together and celebrate that I’m sure your guests will make any day of the week work to be there for your big day,” Pedersen said.

Currently, Stephanie sees her daughter at least three times a week and her oldest son twice a week. In addition, her ex-husband and his wife host family events almost every other weekend — birthdays, holidays, game nights, etc., and she never wants to miss them. They are so close that there are no secrets and lots of “inside jokes.” I feel very much like an outsider at times.
 I love her family, and they have welcomed me with open arms, but I can’t seem to get used to this much “togetherness.” Once my kids were grown and out of the house, I wanted to enjoy my life while they pursued their own fun. I’m at the point that I’m tired of her family, especially since her ex always seems to be the organizer of these get-togethers.
 I don’t want to hurt her or her family’s feelings, but I would prefer more private time traveling or visiting with my friends and family, and we are not finding a good balance.
 They all attend the same church every week and even sit together as if they were still one big, happy family, even though it has been 20 years since their divorce. She tells me that I am No. 1 in her life, but her actions say otherwise. What do I do?

Developers have pledged to invest more than £800,000 into the community after permission was granted for them to build 65 new homes in Haughley.
 In March, Bellway received the green light by Mid Suffolk District Council to build a development of 65 homes on land off Fishponds Way in Haughley, near Stowmarket, as well as public open space and a children’s play area.
 Bellway have said the project, which will contain 23 affordable homes, is to commence construction in due course.

 Bellway’s outline plans for the development were approved last May.
 Haughley Parish Council were in favour of the proposals, though asked for cooperation with the developers around the removal of hedges to make way for a new footpath.
