MOSCOW: Russia´s Constitutional Court on Monday approved a package of amendments including a "reset" of President Vladimir Putin´s previous terms, giving him the possibility to rule into 2036.
 The approval came just two days after Putin signed the reform bill, which has faced fierce criticism from opposition figures who say it will allow the longtime Russian leader to become "president for life".
 The court published the ruling on its website, upholding a wide-ranging package of reforms first proposed by Putin in January and approved last week by Russia´s two houses of parliament.
 A public vote on the reforms has been scheduled for April 22 but it was unclear whether that might be delayed by the global coronavirus crisis. Putin first proposed the reforms in January, in a shock to Russia´s political establishment that was quickly followed by the resignation of his long-time prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.
 The reforms included granting more power to parliament and strengthening the role of the State Council, an advisory body, leading to speculation that Putin -- first elected in 2000 -- could hold on to power in a new role. Putin repeatedly denied he had any intention of staying on but then last week suddenly backed a last-minute amendment by the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, restarting the clock on previous presidential terms.
 His allies rallied behind the move, saying Putin, 67, deserved the chance to run for another six years in 2024, after his current term expires, and again in 2030. The head of the upper house Federation Council said Putin had "raised Russia from its knees", while others said he was the kind of stable leader Russia needed in turbulent times.
 Critics, including chief opposition figure Alexei Navalny, said Putin was securing himself at least another 12 years in power, potentially allowing him to rule longer than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.
 Opposition supporters have demonstrated in recent days in a series of one- person picket protests, the only kind allowed in Russia without previous permission. The opposition has called for mass demonstrations against the plan but gatherings of more than 5,000 people are currently banned in Moscow over coronavirus fears.
 In line with Putin´s strongly conservative views, the reforms also enshrine a mention of Russians´ "faith in God" and stipulate that marriage is a union between a man and woman, effectively banning gay marriages.
 The amendments ban giving away Russian territory and outlaw calls promoting such a move, as well protecting the "historic truth" about the country´s role in World War II.
 A number of social reforms are also included, among them a minimum wage that should not be below the subsistence level and state pensions regularly adjusted to inflation.

Momentary power glitches or long-term outages can cause equipment degradation or instantaneous loss of data, resulting in economic and operational setbacks. In the recent years, the need for power protection solutions has increased significantly, on the back of growing reliance upon high tech equipment and microprocessor-based systems which are highly susceptible to power issues such as high voltage spikes, brownouts, frequency variations, and others.

 Two events in close succession just before the 6th anniversary of the Willie Obiano administration on March 17, 2020, open a window into the resilient community that has been forging in Anambra State. It is an evolving society in which the government - citizen pact is growing roots. More importantly, the process has largely been driven by its participatory and transparent nature.
 On February 29, 2020, the 12th Nigeria Police Games kicked off in Anambra State. The eight day sports competition was widely adjudged a resounding success. But the crunch was whether to host the Games in the first place in the prevailing economic circumstance? Would the Obiano administration's policy of 'doing more with less' win again? Did the principle still resonate with the public? The two questions were answered in the affirmative. The huge task of providing the needed facilities and services for a successful hosting at short notice was understood by sections of the society. However, the conviction was strong that in the true tradition of rising up to the demands of time, the set targets would be met. And they were. Public support proved pivotal to successful hosting; in a competition involving over three thousand athletes and officials, there were no cases of injuries or brawls.
 In another historic break, Governor Willie Obiano on Thursday, March 12, 2020, commissioned the impressive NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp built by his administration at Mbaukwu/Umuawulu. It is a project with especial significance for the Anambra society. Since creation in 1991, Anambra had for 28 years operated a temporary, improvised NYSC camp at Umunya. The State received butt of derisive jokes from youth corpers and other concerned Nigerians for this act of omission. Obiano found this self relegation unacceptable and had on February 10, 2015 laid the foundation stone, restoring Ndi Anambra's sense of pride with delivery of the complex.
 It is partly correct to trace the making of this new Anambra State to the traumatic events of 2003 to 2006. However, the an attempt at a new consciousness by the Chris Ngige regime was circumstantial, narrow in objective and driven by the instinct of self survival. The radical shift came with the reclamation of Peter Obi's stolen 2003 governorship mandate. That democratic empowerment ushered in the season of citizen - centred governance. The APGA - driven change mission has received impetus from Obiano in a number of ways.
 The Willie Obiano administration's efforts to place Anambra State on the front row of Nigeria's developing States seems philosophically run on the legacies of leading lights of Anambra State origin in history. The quest to maintain the standards of heritage has often meant taking on challenges that break new grounds. It is a spirit that Ndi Anambra recognised in the realised dream of making Anambra a major food producing State; an investor choice destination; a system of functional institutions exemplified by the State road maintenance agency. It is a mission that Ndi Anambra has come to share.
 Rallying the people became easier by striking the right chord and regularly demonstrating the fitting spirit. From the outset, the invitation to participatory governance jettisoned officialdom and took on an affective appeal. In his addresses and interaction with groups, Obiano again and again uses the endearment expression 'umunnem.' The kindred compliment has a way of breaking the partition between governor and governed, affording the atmosphere for constructive engagement.
 Aside stakeholders' summit, the Obiano administration interfaces with the influential Anambra Elders' Council on a quarterly basis. The body comprises past governors of the State, retired Chief Judges, bishops of the Church, select captains of industry and such other outstanding citizens of the State. With the wide spread of members' constituencies, aggregate public opinion is conveyed through the Council's input in decision - making.
 The new Anambra State has come this far because the present leadership has put the people first in the consideration of choices open to it. Obiano stands out as a Governor who has kept fidelity to the principle of continuity in government. Obiano who inherited N9b cash, N35b investment and N109b debt from the Peter Obi administration has continued with the execution of uncompleted projects he met on assumption of office in 2014. Among the inherited projects completed are roads, hospitals, school blocks, government buildings, Agulu Lake Resort and Onitsha Shopping Mall.
 With its commitment to continuity and completion of inherited projects, the Willie Obiano regime saved Anambra State losses associated with policy inconsistency. It is a sad reality that projects are sometimes discontinued for new ones by successor administrations for the lure of taking political credit. The spectre of abandoned work sites is also about contractors absconding from site after collecting hefty mobilisation fees.
 As Catholic newspaper Fides observed in its editorial on commissioning of the Onitsha Mall [April 17 - 23, 2016], 'Obiano could have chosen to abandon the project and cite any reason for that.' Not only do incidences of arbitrary project discontinuation lead to investor flight, it introduces the element of instability in governance as well as stalling development. In 1983 the Lagos State Government had concluded arrangements to introduce the metroline transportation system in the State at the cost of $100m. Indeed, preliminary work had started at Yaba when the December 31, 1983 coup occurred. The new ruling junta unilaterally cancelled the project which action attracted a default penalty of $60m on the country.
 Consider also that the expatriate consultants who produced the road map to Nigeria's steel development had chosen Onitsha as the fitting site for steel industry. But this expert decision was discarded by small - minds in strategic government positions who changed the location to Ajaokuta. Four decades later, and trillions of naira into the bargain, Ajaokuta has neither grown into a town capable of hosting a modern industrial complex nor has it started producing quality steel.

As Simon Sinek says, “People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.” What that means is that people want to buy products or services from companies that they like and trust. Therefore, telling your story and creating affinity and brand loyalty over time will yield far greater results than making one transactional sale with the customer relationship based on an exchange of goods and services for a set price and nothing more, nothing less. Companies need to make sales to stay in business; it’s a critical piece but it cannot be the only one. They also need to pay close attention to how they articulate their brand and seek to build loyalty among their customers. Dig deeper into the Evan Nierman interview here.

Off course Palma is the heart of Mallorca, yet it isn´t everything there is … By car you can do many excursions, head into the spectacular Tramuntana mountain range and visit some of the enormously charming little villages there. Deia, Valdemossa or Puerto de Soller are just a few names you should remember. There is a very cute, over 100-year-old train that goes from Palma to Soller and from there you can take the equally quaint tram to the port. A recommendable trip on the water would be going on a guided tour to the island of Cabrera, which is also a nature reserve. On the way they will tell you a lot about the interesting history as well as the fauna and flora of this place. Go swim in caves with crystal clear water and soak up the Mediterranean sun. A day yacht charter, most likely on a motor yacht from Palma would be another option to go there. One of those motor yacht charter boats can fit up to 6 to 8 people and you get a skipper to take you to the island, where you can snorkel or dive and admire the unspoilt underwater world.

Dear Dave,   Should you still pay debts that are in collections, even if they have been dropped from your credit report? The one in question is from 2011, and I assume it isn't showing on the credit report anymore because it's 9 years old.   Sam
 Dear Sam,   There are two good reasons to go back and deal with this debt. One, even if it's off your credit report, you may still legally owe the money. Even if the statute of limitations has run its course, things like this have a habit of popping up and causing problems at the worst possible times. About the time you decide to buy a home, this is liable to raise its head again and mess things up. So, the fact that something doesn't appear on a credit report doesn't mean you're not legally liable, or that they won't bother you about it later.   The second thing to think about is a simple matter of fact - you owe the money. Regardless of what the legal system or credit report says, you morally owe the money. I'd contact the creditor, and begin negotiations to settle the debt. You might be able to reach an agreement where they'd accept less than the original amount owed. Regardless, get any type of settlement offer in writing. That way, you're truly cleaning up your life and getting rid of any financial skeletons in your closet!   Dave
 The simple thing is the right thing   Dear Dave,   I recently found out my former employer never stopped contributing to my health savings account (HSA). Apparently, this has been going on for about nine months, and they just sent me a form to sign so they can get the overpayment back. The amount totals a little over $1,000, so should I sign the papers or is there another way to handle this?   Ellie
 Dear Ellie,   You know, if I were as incompetent as your former employer, I'd be too embarrassed to ask for the money back. But hey, the point is it's not your money. Sign the forms, and let them take the money out. Keep an eye on your HSA balance, though, and make sure they take out only the amount they overpaid - not one penny more or less.   Keep it simple, Ellie. You didn't earn this money, and it wasn't expected or agreed upon. It was a mistake, so just do the right thing. Control the scenario, and stay on top of this situation until everything is resolved correctly.   Dave

NORTH HAVEN, Maine (AP) — People can't be blamed for wanting to find an island hideout as more people around the world become infected with the new coronavirus. But one island in Maine has made it clear that newcomers are not welcome. North Haven Select Board voted Sunday to ban visitors and seasonal residents immediately to prevent the spread of the coronavirus to the island in Penobscot Bay. Town Clerk Kathleen Macy said most residents are supportive and that time will tell whether town officials overreacted. She said the virus has put communities "into uncharted territory." The town, which has a year- round population of about 375, has an older population and it's so small that it could be overwhelmed if people become sick.

It is with heavy hearts and great sadness that the family announces the passing of Gordon Hunt at the great age of 91.

Loving father of Robert, Jean Schwab (Harry), and Darlene. Proud grandpa of Eric Schwab (Jessica Jenkins) and Kristi Schwab (Kyle Kent) and great-grandpa of Vada Rose and Xander Schwab. Not to forget his fur babies Ruby and Jordy. Predeceased by his parents Robert and May, brother Robert (Florence), and sister Dorothy (George). Gordon's greatest love was his family, he wanted to share nothing more than a home cooked meal with his family. He always had time to shoot the breeze, share a laugh or have a beer. His motto in life was the more the merrier. He had a sense of humour and was cracking a joke right up till his final days. He was an avid fisherman and loved being outdoors. He was in his element in spring when he could be outside, listening to the birds and puttering around, or just sitting enjoying the solitude of nature. Cremation has taken place. A celebration of Gordon's life will be scheduled at a later date. As an expression of sympathy, donation may be made to the or the Humane Society.

There are few entertainment companies started 25 years ago that are still around and relevant today; few heavy players from the past 25 years still relevant and influential today. And I do not know a lot of Nigerians more instrumental to the development of contemporary Nigerian music than Ayo Animashaun. Along with Femi Aderibigbe, Alex Okosi, Tajuddeen Adepetu, Keke Ogungbe, Dayo Adeneye, Nelson brown, Jimmy JATT, Emmanuel Ugolee, Joke Jaiyesimi, and few others, the hitherto sceptical Nigerian audience, gatekeepers, brands, regulators, and government were forced to pay attention and align. And we owe them more than a debt of gratitude.
 But I wish the business Ayo Animashaun built had become bigger than it currently is. I wish he would be able to raise some good investment, improve governance, take the company public, and if possible, go into other markets in Africa, Europe and America. I wish we would give the world our own Disneys and Viacoms and CNNs. And Animashaun is one of the few Nigerians who can make it happen.
 I wish also that he would suspend being a teetotaler even if only for today, so he can experience what he’s been missing. Just like Tee A, Ayo Animashaun is famous for not having ever tasted a drop of alcohol. Imagine that. Not having ever tasted the joys of Heineken, Star and 33. Not having had the privilege of cognac and cigars, or Whiskey and pistachios. He’s never even tasted champagne. Just imagine!
 What he lacks, in alcohol taste though, he more than makes up for in his impeccable taste and passion for gadgets, curves, squash, travelling, and cars.
 I had a family friend once, Sunday Ologbese. May God rest his soul. Anytime he walked up to us for some chit chat in front of our gate in Okokomaiko, everyone knew what he was communicating, even without saying much.
 ‘‘Omo I just saw one babe off. Omo yen fineeee gaan mehn…’
 Everyone proceeds to interpret ‘Fine’ in their brains as ‘dark, full-bodied, and tall.
 When I met Ayo Animashaun years later, it wasn’t long before I realized that when he tells you of a lady he’s just been smitten by, you wouldn’t be wrong to picture her as TDC – tall, dark, curvy. With an emphasis on the curves. But we shall not talk about that today, for I do not intend to embarrass a responsible father-of-four who may have his family reading this.
 So how about we replace the above paragraph with his love for his kids, other people’s kids, and how he’s raising some of the most brilliant and well- behaved kids I’ve come across in a while? You only need to meet his first child, Ayotomiwa, to have an idea of the good parenting I’m talking about.
 It’s easy to look at Ayo Animashaun and see a casual, playful, exuberant media and entertainment executive who’s been unable to take his business global even after 25 years.
 It’s easy to look at him as that guy who starts his awards shows late, who – insert whatever controversy you have heard. But I want to suggest an alternative view: This is a man who never attended business school, never raised any investments, built his company pre-social media and media tech, and who has stayed ahead of every technological evolution. How about looking at him as a pioneer, a visionary who walked so that many of us that came after could run and fly? If you like, you can even credit him as the guy who brought hip hop to Nigeria. I doubt anyone would argue.
 Whatever you decide, I truly hope you take a minute today and pay tribute to the man as he clocks 50. He’ll be drinking water or Maltina, but I can assure you that some of us will finish a bottle of Delamain on his behalf. It is possible.

 Trump also said the virus "is not under control" and acknowledged the economy may be falling into a recession.
 Uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in massive volatility on Wall Street in recent weeks. The VIX, one gauge of stock market volatility, spiked 43% on Monday. That takes out the previous record set on October 24, 2008, according to Refinitiv.

 Markets in Asia Pacific have been hammered by the virus, too. The Nikkei, Kospi, Hang Seng and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all fell into a bear market last week.
 Major indexes in mainland China have so far avoided following suit, though they have still recorded declines. The Shanghai Composite is down about 15% from its recent high, short of the 20% it would need to hit to enter a bear market.
 The Shenzhen Component and Shenzhen Composite indexes, meanwhile, are down 14% and 12%, respectively, from their recent peaks.

The International Olympic Committee has ruled out hosting the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games behind closed doors.
 According to a report in _The Guardian_ , it is learnt that IOC is not willing to stage the Games in empty stadiums as that goes against the basic principles of the Olympics.
 John Coates, the leader of the IOC’s coordination commission for the Tokyo Olympics said there is no May deadline to cancel the games and he remains confident the event will go ahead despite sports coming to a standstill globally amid the coronavirus outbreak.
 However, the IOC made it clear that it is not staging the quadrennial event behind closed doors.
 “It would go against everything we stand for. The Olympics is more than just a series of competitions, it is about bringing everyone together to celebrate sport,” a source told _The Guardian_.
 “An event with closed doors and no spectators is not an option,” another source said.
 If the Games are not held then it would have serious ramifications as it is estimated that the organisers would suffer $1billion loss in ticket sales.
 There are further reports stating that the IOC is willing to relax the qualification standards to allow more number of athletes to compete in the Games.
 Although a few qualifying events have taken place, events likes climbing, boxing, fencing and judo have been cancelled or postponed.

The approval came just two days after Putin signed the reform bill, which has faced fierce criticism from opposition figures who say it will allow the longtime Russian leader to become "president for life".
 The court published the ruling on its website, upholding a wide-ranging package of reforms first proposed by Putin in January and approved last week by Russia´s two houses of parliament.
 A public vote on the reforms has been scheduled for April 22 but it was unclear whether that might be delayed by the global coronavirus crisis. Putin first proposed the reforms in January, in a shock to Russia´s political establishment that was quickly followed by the resignation of his long-time prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.
 The reforms included granting more power to parliament and strengthening the role of the State Council, an advisory body, leading to speculation that Putin -- first elected in 2000 -- could hold on to power in a new role. Putin repeatedly denied he had any intention of staying on but then last week suddenly backed a last-minute amendment by the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, restarting the clock on previous presidential terms.
 His allies rallied behind the move, saying Putin, 67, deserved the chance to run for another six years in 2024, after his current term expires, and again in 2030. The head of the upper house Federation Council said Putin had "raised Russia from its knees", while others said he was the kind of stable leader Russia needed in turbulent times.
 Critics, including chief opposition figure Alexei Navalny, said Putin was securing himself at least another 12 years in power, potentially allowing him to rule longer than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.
 Opposition supporters have demonstrated in recent days in a series of one- person picket protests, the only kind allowed in Russia without previous permission. The opposition has called for mass demonstrations against the plan but gatherings of more than 5,000 people are currently banned in Moscow over coronavirus fears.
 In line with Putin´s strongly conservative views, the reforms also enshrine a mention of Russians´ "faith in God" and stipulate that marriage is a union between a man and woman, effectively banning gay marriages.
 The amendments ban giving away Russian territory and outlaw calls promoting such a move, as well protecting the "historic truth" about the country´s role in World War II.
 A number of social reforms are also included, among them a minimum wage that should not be below the subsistence level and state pensions regularly adjusted to inflation.

 All town board, commission and committee meetings, with the exception of Town Council meetings, have been canceled through the end of the month. The cancellations also include the municipal and probate courts. A Town Council meeting that had been scheduled for Monday was canceled last week but the one scheduled for March 23 was still being planned for, Rooney said.
 The Westerly Senior Citizens Center remains open but many regular events for large groups, such as bingo, have been canceled. Seniors can pick up lunches at the center, but the meal will not be served. The center's social worker will be available at the center. Lacey said he would explore whether 12-step meetings that occur at the center and elsewhere throughout the town can continue.
 "The governor has mentioned through all of this that it's essential to keep mental health services available," Lacey said.
 Similarly, Lacey and Rooney said they planned to speak with officials at the WARM Center to change their approach for the daily dinner the center offers for people in need. The center typically serves more than 25 people at a time.

Japan Olympic Committee's deputy chief Kozo Tashima said Tuesday he had tested positive for the coronavirus, as doubts increase over whether Tokyo can safely host the Summer Games.
 "Today, my test result showed positive for the new coronavirus," Tashima said in a statement, issued via the Japan Football Association, which he also heads.
 Tashima said he was on a business trip since February 28, first heading to Belfast to attend the annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board.
 From March 2, he visited Amsterdam for a UEFA meeting to give a presentation on Japan's bid for the 2023 women's World Cup.
 On March 3, he attended a general meeting of UEFA.
 "In Amsterdam and in Europe in early March, the level of nervousness against the novel coronavirus was not the same as now. Everyone was still doing hugs, handshakes and bises (cheek kissing)," he said in the statement.
 He then travelled to the United States to watch the Japanese women's team in action and to lobby for the women's World Cup, before returning home on March 8.

A key omission of the Intend to Publish draft London Plan was the commitment to the strategic Green Belt review recommended by the Planning Inspectorate. The Mayor had also refused to make changes to his Green Belt policy that would allow for release in exceptional circumstances, as allowed for in national policy. The Secretary of State's response was surprisingly silent on a strategic Green Belt review and it looks like the political ping-pong on the issue is set to continue, with no one wanting to take responsibility for one of London's fundamental development constraints - its restricted land supply. The Annex to the letter has directed the Mayor to amend Green Belt policy to reflect national policy. This direction is welcomed but it does fail to address the concerns raised by Savills in the Examination in Public (EIP), namely that Green Belt needs to be strategically reviewed in order to identify areas for housing and industry growth based around future infrastructure projects. It seems reasonable that a strategic Green Belt review will need to be conducted in order to inform the most sustainable strategy for any future London Plan.

Motion sickness is a common condition experienced by around 50% to 60% of the general global population. It is more common in children and elderly. Various prescription and over the counter (OTC) drugs and products are available for treat motion sickness. Adoption of prescription drugs such as scopolamine patches and tablets and promethazine tablets is increasing in developed markets as these provide long lasting relief, better efficacy, and fewer side effects. Higher prices of these products are likely to drive the motion sickness treatment market. Surge in number of travelers across the globe is estimated to increase consumption of motion sickness remedies. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2017, international tourist arrival grew by 7% as compared to 2016. Studies estimate that around 50% of travelers experience motion sickness in course of travel. However, recent introduction of generic transdermal scopolamine patches and over dependence on OTC and traditional medicines for motion sickness treatment are likely to hamper the global market.
