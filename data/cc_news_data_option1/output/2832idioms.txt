WASHINGTON — It stands as the biggest economic rescue in U.S. history, the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill swiftly approved by Congress in the spring. And it's painfully clear now, as the pandemic worsens, it was only the start.
 With COVID-19 cases hitting alarming new highs and the death roll rising, the pandemic's devastating cycle is happening all over again, leaving Congress little choice but to engineer another costly rescue. Businesses are shutting down, schools cannot fully reopen and jobs are disappearing, all while federal emergency aid expires. Without a successful federal plan to control the outbreak, Congress heads back to work with no endgame to the crisis in sight.
 "It's not going to magically disappear," said a somber Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., during a visit to a hospital in his home state to thank front-line workers.
 Lawmakers return Monday to Washington to try to pull the country back from the looming COVID-19 cliff. While the White House prefers to outsource much of the decision-making on virus testing and prevention to the states, the absence of a federal intervention has forced the House and Senate to try to draft another assistance package.
 It's a massive undertaking, hardly politically popular, but the alternative is worse. Experts predict an even more dire public health outlook for winter. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, says the U.S. needs to "regroup."
 As McConnell prepares to roll out his $1 trillion-plus proposal, he acknowledges it will not have full support. Already the White House is suggesting changes, Republicans are divided and broader disagreements with Democrats could derail the whole effort.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., already pushed through a more sweeping $3 trillion relief bill to bolster virus testing, keep aid flowing and set new health and workplace standards for reopening schools, shops and workplaces.
 She said recently she finds herself yearning for an earlier era of Republicans in the White House, saying tha despite differences, even with President Richard Nixon, who resigned facing impeachment, "At least we had a shared commitment to the governance of our country."
 The political stakes are high for all sides before the November election, but even more so for the nation, which now has more coronavirus infections and a higher death count than any other country. On Friday, two former Federal Reserve Board leaders urged Congress to do more.
 "Time is running out," Pelosi said.
 There were just a few hundred coronavirus cases when Congress first started focusing on emergency spending in early March. By the end of that month, as Congress passed a $2.2 trillion bill, cases soared past 100,000 and deaths climbed past 2,000.
 Today, the death toll stands at more than 139,000 in the U.S., with 3.6 million-plus confirmed cases.
 The virus that first tore into New York, California and America's big cities is now plaguing places large and small, urban and rural, burning through the South, West and beyond without restraint.
 Freezer cases that stored bodies outside New York hospitals are now on order in Arizona. The mobilization of military medical units to help overworked health care providers has shifted now to Texas.
 Lawmakers hardly wore facial masks when they voted in March as the Capitol was shutting down and sending them to the ranks of work-from-home Americans. Trump and his allies still rarely wear them. But at least 25 governors from states as diverse as Alabama to Oregon now have mask requirements. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this past week that if everyone wore a mask, iit could help "drive this epidemic to the ground."
 Just as the pandemic's ferocious cycle is starting again, the first round of aid is running out.
 A federal $600-a-week boost to regular unemployment benefits expires at the end of the month. So, too, does the federal ban on evictions on millions of rental units.
 With 17 straight weeks of unemployment claims topping 1 million — usually its about 200,000 — many households are facing a cash crunch and losing employer- backed health insurance coverage.
 Despite flickers of an economic upswing as states eased stay-home orders in May and June, the jobless rate remains at double digits, higher than it ever was in the last decade's Great Recession.
 Pelosi's bill, approved in May, includes $75 billion for testing and tracing to try to get a handle on the virus spread, funnels $100 billion to schools to safely reopen and sends $1 trillion to cash-strapped states that are pleading for federal dollars to pay essential workers and prevent layoffs. The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.
 McConnell hit "pause" after passage of the last aid package as Republicans hoped the economy would rebound and stem the need for more assistance. He now acknowledges additional intervention is needed.
 His bill centers on a five-year liability shield to prevent what he calls an "epidemic of lawsuits" against businesses, schools and health care providers. The bill is expected to provide up to $75 billion for schools, another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans and grants to child care providers. There is likely to be tax credits to help companies shoulder the cost of safely reopening shops, offices and other businesses.
 Unlike the other virus aid pacakges that passed almost unanimously, McConnell says this one will be more difficult to approve.
 In the two months since Pelosi's bill passed, the U.S. had 50,000 more deaths and 2 million more infections.
 "If we don't invest the money now, it will be much worse," Pelosi said.

"We have great chemistry, they really believe in what we are trying to do and you can sense that. They deserve it," Mikel Arteta said."To beat the best you need to take your opportunities and when you have to defend you have to put everybody on the line."I'm extremely happy and proud of our players, but it's very sad we cannot enjoy this moment with our fans."Just days after beating Premier League champions Liverpool, Arsenal offered further evidence that Arteta could be the man to restore them to the glory days of the Arsene Wenger era.Arsenal had lost their previous seven meetings with City, including a 3-0 drubbing in their first game after the coronavirus hiatus.But, thanks to Arteta's masterstroke, Arsenal handed Guardiola's side a first Wembley defeat in their last 10 visits."We've had an incredible week to beat the best two teams in Europe. It doesn't happen every day," Arteta said."I don't care who plays, I can trust them. We made changes and everyone was ready."We had to suffer in many moments. We had to be really well organised and minimise the spaces."City, unbeaten in their previous 22 domestic cup ties, were well short of their best and Guardiola had no excuses."We didn't play good. The only regret is not to lose the game, that can happen, but it is that we did not play the first half like we play the second," Guardiola said after City mustered just one shot on target, their fewest since 2018 against Liverpool in the Champions League."We started low and without the way you have to play. We are always ready many times but today we were not."I knew they play five at the back and with high pressing. They defended well. It happened against Liverpool too so we knew it. But we were not good."Rope-a-dope planWith second place in the Premier League secured, City have to focus on the resumption of their Champions League challenge in August, when they defend a 2-1 first leg lead against Real Madrid in the last 16."Now we have two weeks," Guardiola said. "We wanted to play the FA Cup final, one week before the Madrid game, to be in rhythm, but we missed this chance."Arteta knows City well after his time as Guardiola's assistant and he set out to exploit their weakness against counter attacks, using Aubameyang and Nicolas Pepe to get behind City's attacking full-backs Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy.Aubameyang made them pay in the 19th minute.At the climax of an 18-pass move, Pepe's deep cross caught Walker dozing and Aubameyang eluded him to slide a fine finish off the far post from a tight angle.It was the kind of incisive, imaginative attack that City usually torment Arsenal with, but for once it was the men in red celebrating.The Gabon striker's 24th goal of the season was a reminder why Arsenal are so desperate to get him to sign a contract extension.Defending deep, Arsenal were putting their bodies in the way of everything to keep City at bay.Arteta's rope-a-dope plan brought a rich reward in the 71st minute.City left themselves open at the back and Aubameyang beat the offside trap as he accelerated onto Kieran Tierney's sublime pass before slotting under Ederson.",

A fast-rising tide of new coronavirus cases is flooding emergency rooms in parts of the United States, with some patients moved into hallways and nurses working extra shifts to keep up with the surge.
 Patients struggling to breathe are being placed on ventilators in emergency wards since intensive care units are full, officials say, and the near- constant care they require is overtaxing workers who also are treating more typical ER cases like chest pains, infections, and fractures.
 In Texas, Dr. Alison Haddock of the Baylor College of Medicine said the current situation is worse than after Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston with floodwaters in 2017. The state reported a new daily record for virus deaths Friday and more than 10,000 confirmed cases for the fourth consecutive day.
 “I’ve never seen anything like this COVID surge,” said Haddock, who has worked in emergency rooms since 2007. “We’re doing our best, but we’re not an ICU.”
 Patients are waiting “hours and hours” to get admitted, she said, and the least sick people are lying in beds in halls to make room for most seriously ill.
 Around Seattle, which was the nation's first hot spot for the virus that causes COVID-19, a new wave of patients is showing up at emergency departments, said nurse Mike Hastings.
 “What’s really frustrating from my side of it is when a patient comes into the emergency department, and is not really having symptoms of COVID, but they feel like they need that testing,” said Hastings, who works at an area hospital and is president of the Emergency Nurses Association. “Sometimes we’re not able to test them because we don’t have enough test supplies, so we’re only testing a certain set of patients."
 In Florida, another state that is seeing surging case numbers, hospitals say they are in desperate need of remdesivir — a medication that has been shown to shorten average hospitalization times — to treat the coronavirus patients who are filling up beds.
 In response, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced 30,000 vials of the drug were being shipped to the state — enough to treat about 5,000 patients.
 On Saturday, Florida reported more than 10,200 new cases of the virus and 90 additional deaths, while Missouri recorded a pandemic-high 958 new cases in one day. Arizona, which conducts periodic reviews of death certificates, reclassified 106 deaths as having been from COVID-19, bringing the number of fatalities reported Saturday to 147.
 Confirmed coronavirus cases around the world have surpassed 14 million, and deaths rose above 600,000, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. On Saturday, the World Health Organization, which also tracks the virus, reported a single-day record of new infections — over 259,000 worldwide — for the second day in a row. The true toll of the pandemic is thought to be even higher, in part because of shortages in testing and shortcomings in data collection.
 The United States, Brazil and India top the list of cases, and South Africa — with more than 350,000 cases, roughly half of all confirmed infections in Africa — entered the top five this weekend.
 In the United States, where infections are soaring in many Sunbelt states, Megan Jehn, associate professor of epidemiology at Arizona State University in Tempe, said it's important to monitor emergency room visits since increases there can signal that the virus is spreading more rapidly.
 But it's difficult to get a complete picture of how emergency rooms are faring in many places. In Arizona, one of the few states that reports data on visits to the emergency room by people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, numbers started to spike in early June and peaked earlier this month. More than 2,000 people went to an ER with coronavirus symptoms on a single day, July 7.
 On Friday, COVID-19-related hospitalization figures for Arizona were near but below recent records set after the state became a national hot spot.
 Dr. Robert Hancock, who works at multiple hospitals in Texas and Oklahoma and serves as president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said some Texas emergency rooms are facing backups of patients awaiting ICU beds. And many of them are on ventilators, meaning they require more attention than other patients.
 "Unfortunately, because of the increased demand for personnel, there typically isn’t anybody free to come down to the ER to help a lot of times from a nursing standpoint,” he said.
 Burnout could await these health workers, as it did some in New York City, when it was the epicenter of the nation's outbreak in the spring.
 Emergency room doctors and nurses were caught off guard by the relentless stream of severely sick patients during shifts that often lasted 12 hours, said Dr. Bernard P. Chang of New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center.
 “You were on high alert the whole shift,” Chang said. “It was a brutal, sustained battle.”

The first thing you'll notice is the quiet. If Joe Biden wins this thing, there will be no disgraceful presidential tweets and no furious cable segments reacting to them on Inauguration Day.
   
 Donald Trump himself may fume, but hated and alone. The opportunists who make up his administration will abandon him. Republicans will pretend they never heard his name. Republican politicians are not going to hang around a guy they privately hate and who publicly destroyed their majority.
   
 But there will be a larger quiet, too. For two decades American politics has centered on a bitter culture war between the white working-class heartland and university-bred coastal elites.
   
 Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were all emblems of this university class, and it was easy for the Republican media wing to gin up resentment against them. In 2016, Trump beat Clinton among the white working class by a crushing 28 points.
   
 But Biden is not an emblem of this coastal elite. His sensibility was nurtured by his working-class family during the postwar industrial boom of the 1950s and 1960s. He graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 and missed the late 1960s culture war that divided a generation.
   
 It's very hard for conservatives to demonize Biden because he comes from the sort of background that Trumpian conservatives celebrate. He eludes all the culture war divides. He doesn't act superior to the "deplorables," because his family taught him to despise status games of all sorts.
   
 It will become immediately clear that in a Biden era politics will shrink back down to normal size. It will be about government programs, not epic wars about why my sort of people are morally superior to your sort of people. In the Trump era a lot of people who don't care about government got manic about politics.
   
 It will also become immediately clear that in a highly ideological age, America will be led by a man who is not ideological.
   
 This week a few of us columnist types spoke with Biden about his economic plans. His most telling sentence was, "I've kind of tried to shed the labels and focus on the nuts and bolts of this."
   
 I asked him to describe the big forces that have flattened working-class wages over the past decades. Other people would have spun grand theories about broken capitalism or the rise of the corporate oligarchy. But Biden pointed to two institutional failures -- the way Republicans have decentralized power and broken Washington and the way Wall Street forces business leaders to focus obsessively on the short term.
   
 Biden's worldview seems to come mainly from lived experience, not a manifesto somewhere. He has lived experience of a time when there were good manufacturing jobs, when unions protected workers, when the less affluent had a ladder to climb.
   
 His economic agenda, promoted under the slogan "Build Back Better," is about that, not some vast effort to remake capitalism or build a Nordic-style welfare system. The agenda is more New Deal than New Left.
   
 In the two speeches he has delivered so far there are constant references to our manufacturing base -- infrastructure, steelworkers, engineers, ironworkers, welders, 500,000 charging stations for electric cars. "When I think of climate change, the word I think of is jobs," he declared.
   
 The agenda pushes enormous resources toward two groups: first, African- Americans, who have been pummeled by deindustrialization for decades; and second, white working-class Trump voters. This looks like an attempt to rebuild the New Deal coalition and win back the white working class who should be a core of the Democratic base. Biden's populist "Buy American" messaging is just icing on that cake.
   
 Can he pull off this manufacturing revival and this political realignment?
   
 I'll be curious to see if it's possible to create millions of manufacturing jobs -- or if technology means there's only a need for relatively few workers. I'll be curious to see if he can tamp down the Democratic media and activist wings, with their penchant for wildly unpopular moral gestures like "defund the police" and "decriminalize the border."
   
 I wonder if the economic crisis will obviate all this. With mass unemployment the need will be to get money out the door immediately on Day 1. Launching infrastructure projects and clean energy industries takes a lot of time.
   
 But I do know that if he can win a chunk of the white working class (44% of the electorate, according to Ruy Teixeira), he will realign American politics. I also know that from that first day the Biden agenda will put the surviving Republicans in Congress in an awful bind. Do they cooperate and work with Biden's infrastructure and manufacturing plans? If they oppose him they give him a clear shot to win their voters while also inviting him to end the filibuster.
   
 Everybody says Biden is a moderate, and in intellectual and temperamental terms that is true. But he has found a way to craft an agenda that could reshape the American economy and the landscape of American politics in fundamental ways.
   
 Joe Biden may turn out to be what radical centrism looks like.

 With the Covid-19 pandemic forcing shutdowns and wreaking havoc on lives, livelihoods and economies, an “unprecedented education emergency” looms over the world, according to Save the Children’s recent report. Drawing on UNICEF data for April, which said that 1.6 billion children worldwide were out of school due to Covid-related school closures, the global child rights NGO warns that 9.6 million children are at risk of never returning to school. This is alarming as it means that Covid19 is reversing all the gains that the international community has made over the decades with regard to fighting illiteracy and bringing children to schools. Schools in many countries have shut down and while older children in some countries are still able to go to school, younger ones have to study online. For many, poverty and lack of internet connectivity stand in the way of accessing online education. Covid-19 has also forced children into employment. Since parents have lost their jobs or are earning little, children have to work. With the economic outlook bleak for the coming years, it does seem that many children will remain out of school. The battle to get children to come to school, not drop out, and to complete their education has been a tough one. However, the effort was worth it as the number of children receiving some form of education was growing. That is in danger of being reversed. Going to school is valuable not only to provide children with skills to read write and count and to access knowledge but it provided children with opportunity to meet and play with other children? They learnt social and other life skills in the process. Schools provided children with a space to be just children, have fun but also learn. With Covid-19 forcing children out of school, millions will be denied of this experience. The other requirement for distance learning - the internet - is still out of bounds.
 According to the National Sample Survey education report, just 20 percent Indians above the age of 5 could use the internet, and only 24 percent families had the facility. The trends vary across states, and are even worse for rural areas. The coming months and years will witness governments cutting back in budget allocations for education. Schools in remote areas could be shut and hiring of teachers reduced. Such education-unfriendly decisions will worsen children’s access to schools. Governments at the Centre and in the states must bear in mind that children are the future of the country. To not invest enough in their health and education will undermine their well-being and that of the country. Understandably, the government is preoccupied now with fighting the pandemic. Civil society needs to rise to the occasion. Experts in the fields of education and child development need to begin planning to prevent the looming “unprecedented education emergency.” Private colleges in India which were already offering online education for last two decades now have a massive surge in e-Learning demand to meet.

Born June 30, 1928 in Grand Rapids, Michigan to Otto and Josephine (Oleneack) Piereson, Audrey Riley's soul winged its way to celestial day on July 14, 2020, two years to the day of the passing of her beloved husband Robert Paul Riley. Audrey's early wanderlust led her to take a bus trip to Los Angeles in 1952, where she fell in love with Southern California and soon made it her home. She quickly made lifelong friends with some of her fellow telephone operators at Pacific Bell. While living life to the fullest and socializing at favorite haunts like the Dresden Room, she fell in love with Bob, originally of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, who she married on July 28, 1956. The couple adored their three daughters, raising their family in Canoga Park, where, with a backyard swimming pool and horses, they enjoyed the American dream. Audrey was fun loving, charming, spirited, and always had a smile on her face and an upbeat tone. Despite suffering from Parkinson's disease and macular degeneration in her later years, she never seemed to feel sorry for herself, instead delighting in the small pleasures of listening to movies, talking to her family and friends, or savoring her much loved Sees' candy. Her interests were myriad and eclectic and she was a romantic at heart. She was an avid reader and would often escape for days into the plot of a book. For her an ideal Friday night was spent with a bowl of popcorn and a murder mystery book set in an English village. A love of American history was sparked after reading the books of E.B. Knipe as a young girl, an interest that later led her to join the Daughters of the American Revolution. She loved the movies of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, as well as western epics like Lonesome Dove and Heaven's Gate. Her musical tastes were just as varied, loving classical, Dixieland jazz, Neil Diamond, and country music. Her interests in Native American cultures and Egyptology led her to take courses on anthropology and archaeology. Audrey and Bob found pleasure in international travel, especially enjoying their trips to the UK and Israel. For over 50 years she enjoyed driving cross country to visit her native Michigan in the summer months. Armed with a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, and a AAA triptik, her stops at interesting looking small towns along the way were frequent and often nostalgic. Finding an abandoned farmhouse on a country road would often prompt her to pull over to admire and daydream, and sometimes to sneak in to hunt for ghosts. She loved attending auctions and estate sales, and some of her collecting passions included antique linens, Manhattan and Jadeite depression glassware, vintage chenille bedspreads, Navajo turquoise jewelry and Hopi Kachina figures. She was a generous benefactor to the many charitable organizations she believed in, particularly those promoting educational opportunities for Native Americans. Audrey loved an occasional dry martini with a twist (no olive!), and would pick up the habit of smoking as quickly as she would quit. Although a frugal midwesterner at heart, she loved small luxuries, like her Chanel lipstick, Detchema perfume and her beloved Mercedes wagon. She would recount how when she had first moved to Los Angeles in the 1950s and was working as a telephone operator, she had skipped lunch for a month to save for a cashmere coat she had fallen in love with at I. Magnin's department store. Although a private person by nature, she enjoyed the company of guests and was a delightful hostess. Easter was her favorite holiday to host, and her egg hunts were epic. She was notoriously uninterested in cooking, but she had a wicked sweet tooth and enjoyed making holiday pies and cookies. Audrey was strong willed and held firm to her opinions, and Bob would confide lovingly that after sixty years of marriage she was still often an enigma to him. Her determination and stubbornness could move mountains. With all her many interests, she also whole heartedly engaged herself in the passions of her loved ones, helping to foster their own interests in life. She was an incredible listener and her thoughtfulness will be missed by all who had the pleasure to have known her.

"But I love sumo, so I want to watch this," he said.
 Only 2,500 fans were allowed inside the 11,098-seat stadium, unlike in normal times when bouts are performed in front of sold-out crowds.
 They were asked to refrain from cheering and stick to applause to express their passion.
 "It will be different," said Kazuo Aoki, 49, also a frequent visitor to the arena. "I will cheer in my spirit."
 Anyone with a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 F) or higher was denied entry.
 Spectators also had to wear masks, sanitise their hands, keep a distance from others and refrain from touching wrestlers or approaching them for autographs.
 One wrestler has died from COVID-19 since the epidemic first hit Japan, while several other fighters and officials have tested positive.
 Sumo was last held before live audiences in January, when Japan began to see its first cases of coronavirus.
 A March tournament was held behind closed doors before sumo authorities cancelled the May tournament altogether.
 The current tournament was originally due to be held in the central city of Nagoya, also behind closed doors.
 But officials decided to switch the event to Tokyo to minimise the travel of wrestlers and officials, as well as allow a small amount of fans to watch.
 Still, Tokyo's coronavirus infections have been mounting in recent days and on Sunday, city authorities are expected to announce around 190 new cases.
 Fans said the excitement of sumo was worth the risk.

FLAGLER BEACH -- The county may be forced to forfeit $25 million in state and federal funding if 13 property owners refuse to sign easements for the dune restoration project along Flagler Beach.
   
 The Army Corps of Engineers announced July 8 that it will not move forward with plans to improve the dunes along State Road A1A without full compliance.
   
 The 2.6-mile project requires property owners with a parcel east of State Road A1A from South 6th Street to South 28th Street, to provide easements to the federal, state and local agencies involved so they can add sand and natural vegetation to fortify the dunes.
   
 The county had until June 30 to submit all 141 signed easements.
   
 "We did submit to the Army Corps of Engineers our certificate of lands on June 30," Flagler County Attorney Al Hadeed told county commissioners at their July 9 meeting. "We have 13 property owners that have not signed easements. Two of the 13 have two parcels each. This does jeopardize progress of the project."
   
 Jason Harrah, senior project manager with U.S. Army Corp of Engineers in Jacksonville, told The News-Journal July 14 that there's no way around the guidelines.
   
 "We met with the county a few days ago to discuss a path forward," said Harrah. "They presented the facts of how many easements they still have not been able to obtain for various reasons. We told them that we couldn't move forward with the project constructed with those gaps throughout in the dunes."
   
 According to the county's Shore up the Shore website, the project will reconstruct the eroded dune to extend approximately 10 feet seaward of its present location, and then gently slope down to the surf, extending into the ocean to lengthen the beach.
   
 The project also includes planting native vegetation that has historically grown in Flagler Beach in order to stabilize the dune and provide more habitat for plants and animals.
   
 Harrah says building the dunes will give property owners the protection they need against a future storm.
   
 "We just cleaned up the damage caused by hurricane Matthew," Harrah said. "It could've destroyed people's homes. The Department of Transportation did their part. They built A1A back with the understanding that the Corp would come in and we were going to reinforce the oceanside of A1A with a dune. We want the waves to hit these dunes in a storm. Ultimately if they're washed out, A1A is going to protect it. We can rebuild dunes a lot easier than we can build a road."
   
 Harrah said if the dunes are not improved, everyone will be vulnerable to future storms.
   
 "We have 23 coastal projects in Florida of similar nature to this," said Harrah. "They're all very successful. The dunes we've built have prevented millions of dollars worth of damage from hurricanes. That's exactly what we're trying to do in Flagler County, but we're just not there yet."
   
 In an interview with The News-Journal on Thursday, Hadeed said he will continue working to get the last 13 property owners on board.
   
 "We still have 13 individual owners that we need easements from," said Hadeed. "After our deadline submittal to the Army Corps of Engineers, we did get three additional property owners to sign easements."
   
 Flagler Beach property owner Jere Scola originally held out because he believed signing the easement would limit his access to the beach. Once he received clarification that access wouldn't be affected, he signed the easement to help protect his vacation home.
   
 Attorney John M. Leroux is representing 10 of the property owners who refuse to sign the easement.
   
 "I have clients that are willing to sign the easement as long as the language is changed to communicate that the property owner will not have their rights taken away," said Leroux, who took on the case pro bono. "This has been communicated to Al Hadeed. His response was the language could not be changed."
   
 Hadeed said the project isn't dead yet.
   
 "They did not say, 'We're terminating the project,'" said Hadeed. "They are giving us time to try to bring these easements in. We're still full-court press with trying to persuade property owners to execute the easements."
   
 Hadeed says the county will continue to help move the project forward.
   
 "Our administrator said we'll try for two more weeks to try to get more people on board. I think that takes us to July 24," said Hadeed.
   
 Carol Fisher, who owns one of the homes involved in the project, said when she and her husband first learned about the restoration, they didn't hesitate to sign the easement.
   
 "I don't know the exact date that we signed the easement, but as soon as they sent us a letter saying this is what we want to do, we signed on," said Fisher. "We live right there in front of the ocean, we've watched our road wash out from Hurricane Matthew. This is going to protect our property."
   
 Fisher said she and her husband have reached out to the neighbors who are holding out.
   
 "We talked to about five of our neighbors that are holding out," said Fisher. "We've explained to them that this isn't goinig to cost us anything, it's a win-win."
   
 Fisher said some of her neighbors are under the impression that by signing the easement, they're giving over the rights to their property.
   
 "I've assured them that no one is taking their property away," said Fisher. "They're making your property more valuable. I think some of them don't fully understand the ramifications if the project doesn't move forward."
   
 Fisher told The News-Journal Friday that her husband was at the Flagler Beach City Hall helping a neighbor sign the easement.
   
 Should the county obtain the required easements within the next two weeks, hope may not be lost.
   
 "We have to have the authorization and funding to construct the project from Congress," Harrah said. "Right now we have both. So in two weeks from now, if the county received all the easements, we would then certify our plans and get the project awarded as soon as we could."
   
 Harrah says there are various reasons that residents are reluctant to move forward.
   
 "Some people have a natural distrust I guess for the federal government," he said. "They think that there's some secret agenda. There's nothing secret going on behind the scenes. The folks aren't giving up any of their property rights. They can still build walkovers. They can still utilize their property. All we're trying to do is protect the infrastructure and property."

CHICAGO - Not long into the coronavirus pandemic, the Rev. Sandra Maria Van Opstal, a pastor at Grace and Peace Church on the West Side of Chicago, began to hear from congregants who lost their jobs and were struggling financially as the city closed nonessential businesses to slow the spread of the virus.
   
 Some congregants were essential workers who were anxious about their exposure to the coronavirus and staying apart from family members so they didn't risk bringing the virus to them.
   
 Some had lost loved ones to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
   
 Others were unable to celebrate births or graduations.
   
 And all that was before the nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd, a reminder of the systemic racism that exists in the United States and the trauma that it has caused communities of color.
   
 "I don't think we can ever underestimate the level of trauma we're all experiencing," Van Opstal said.
   
 As Americans deal with the impacts of the pandemic and the country's reckoning over racism, many Christian leaders, organizations and churches are providing resources not only to care for their spiritual and physical health, but also their mental health.
   
 The Chicago pastor said churches have a key role in helping people deal with the fears and anxiety raised by the current crises.
   
 "It's giving people a sign of hope, not just through our words, but the church has an opportunity to give people a sign of hope by how we live," she said.
   
 Jamie Aten, director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, told Religion News Service that congregations now are helping people deal with a wide range of mental health challenges.
   
 And the challenges that existed before the coronavirus haven't just gone away, according to Aten.
   
 Those include depression, anxiety, grief and addictions, as well as child abuse and domestic violence.
   
 "The pandemic is compounding those mental health struggles and amplifying them, plus creating new mental health struggles that people may not have been experiencing prior to the pandemic," Aten said.
   
 The number of Americans reporting depression and anxiety symptoms has more than tripled since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data from an emergency weekly Census Bureau survey.
   
 Those numbers have spiked among Asian Americans as they've experienced increased racism in the months since the coronavirus first appeared in China, according to The Washington Post. The numbers have been highest among Black Americans in the weeks following Floyd's death, the Post reported.
   
 Black and Latino Americans across the country have also been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus, according to CDC data recently made available by The New York Times.
   
 "While we're experiencing this trauma of the pandemic, this trauma of institutional and systemic racism in this country, we're also being asked, 'Well, how does that make you feel? What's going on? How are you living with it? How do you digest it?'" said Tiffanie Henry, a licensed psychotherapist based in Atlanta.
   
 "And it really is too much."
   
 The pandemic, the racial divide and stories of police brutality can be re- traumatizing for many, said Henry, who is Black. Every headline or viral video can make people relive their past experiences, their losses and their fears. And discussions of racism also can be difficult.
   
 When white people ask people of color to explain their experiences of racism, she said, "what you are essentially asking them to do is to re-traumatize themselves for your benefit."
   
 Organizations like To Write Love on her Arms and the Humanitarian Disaster Institute have created and compiled a number of resources to help individuals cope and churches respond to the mental health challenges the moment brings with it.
   
 HDI's research has shown that positive spiritual support can reduce stress, trauma and anxiety amid crises, according to Aten. But that often happens face to face, he said, which is problematic when people are asked to stay at least six feet apart.
   
 "What we know is what helps people sometimes the most is what could also put them at risk," he said. "That practical presence can be difficult to do when we're isolated, but, at the same time, we still can help and still offer practical presence even when we're isolated physically from one another."
   
 Aten encouraged church leaders and others to get into a rhythm of checking in with others and watch for any changes in behavior or red flags that someone might be considering harm to him- or herself or others.
   
 He also encouraged people not to let their own self-care fall by the wayside, though that may mean joining a friend for coffee over Zoom rather than in person.
   
 And he pointed to research connecting spiritual practices like reading Scripture, journaling and meditating to better mental health outcomes.
   
 "Some of the research that we've done at HDI has shown that when something horrible and unexpected happens, it threatens our meaning. And when our meaning is threatened, it can start to turn our life upside down, where what we thought we knew about the world suddenly no longer makes sense," Aten said.
   
 Impact Church, a United Methodist congregation in the Atlanta area, already was having open discussions about mental health before the pandemic, according to the Rev. Olu Brown, its lead pastor.
   
 "One of the biggest things we do is to normalize therapy and not downplay the need or the benefit, while at the same time highlighting the spiritual discipline aspects of meditation and prayer and counseling and all of those kinds of things," Brown said.
   
 In May, Brown preached an online sermon that highlighted several tips on managing stress during the pandemic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): notice how you feel, take breaks from COVID-19 news coverage, make time for sleep and exercise, stay connected and reach out if you feel overwhelmed.
   
 In the sermon, Brown also shared that he was seeing his therapist more frequently because of the stress and anxiety of the pandemic.
   
 "I not only need the support of God, I need the support of God-credentialed people like therapists and counselors to talk me through, to walk me through," he said.
   
 After a virtual staff retreat with Henry, who attends Impact, the church has included her in conversations about reopening its building for services.
   
 "We became aware that we really needed her input in helping us think through the reopening because people have been through some form of trauma in this COVID-19 experience, from loss of loved ones to loss of space to loss of normalcy," Brown said.
   
 Grace and Peace Church, the Christian Reformed church where Van Opstal is a pastor, also can't assume any of its congregants are doing OK, Van Opstal said.
   
 Church leaders have been calling church and community members to check in, according to the pastor. They're praying for those who come pick up food from the church's weekly distribution and have put together lists of mental health professionals who specialize in treating people of color.
   
 Leaders also have asked members who have resources to help pay for counseling for members who can't afford it, she said.
   
 "I believe that churches can do a lot to remind people that they're seen, that they're not forgotten, especially those of us that pastor in communities where people feel afraid and forgotten," Van Opstal said.

CHARLES "CHUCK" WAYNE WHITE Bettendorf Charles Wayne White, known to family and friends as Chuck, passed from this life at his Bettendorf, Iowa, home on July 8, 2020. He was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on May 30, 1931, to Harold Howard and Clella Mae (Donelson) White. The family lived in Lamoni, Iowa, and that's where, the summer before his freshman year in high school, Chuck was offered a pretzel by a beautiful young girl as he mowed his grandmother's yard. He would go on to be class president and compete in football, basketball and track for Lamoni Community Schools. Five years after meeting on the lawn, Chuck and Kathryn JoAnn DeLong were married on July 22, 1950. Chuck attended Graceland College and later the University of Iowa, where he graduated with a degree in business, marketing and economics and solidified his lifelong love of the Hawkeyes. Following graduation, he joined the family business, White Motor Co., which served as one of the oldest Ford dealerships in the state of Iowa up to the time of its closing. Chuck and Jo lived for many years in Lamoni, where he was a respected community member. He always credited Jo with being the best influence on his life, and at age 27, he joined the priesthood of the RLDS (Community of Christ) Church, being first called as an elder and later as a high priest. He also served on the Lamoni Stake Bishopric group. Chuck served 14 years on the city council. In 1991, Chuck and Jo left Lamoni for Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Chuck worked for 23 years as a car salesman with Zimmerman Ford. An eternal optimist, Chuck was known to have a smile that lit up his sparkling blue eyes. His devotion to his wife and family never flagged, even when the pandemic required them to maintain physical distance. Chuck and Jo were finally able to meet again in person the day before his peaceful passing. Chuck was preceded in death by his parents; and his brother, Bill. He is survived by his wife of 70 years, Kathryn JoAnn White; two children, Pamela White of Davenport, and Laura Craft (Neil) of Unionville, Mo.; and grandchildren Les Wight (Hallie) of St. Louis, Mo., Brian Craft of St. Genevieve, Mo., Nathan Craft of Des Moines and Katie Hallman (Cavan) of Cedar Rapids. Other survivors include three great-grandchildren. Chuck will be remembered for his incredible commitment to faith and family, for his kindness, his generosity and for his warm laugh. A memorial service will be held in Lamoni at a later date. Those wishing to send remembrances may address them to Kathryn JoAnn White, in care of the Kahl Home, 6701 Jersey Ridge Rd., Davenport, IA 52807. Online condolences may be expressed to the family at www.sladefuneralhome.com.

TIVERTON -- Early birds may get the best parking spaces at Fogland Beach, but they're also going to be reminded by members of the Recreation Commission who will be there just as early that they have to pay up when the gatekeeper arrives.
 Recreation Commission Chairman Stuart Gilfillen said there will also be more of a police presence at the beach on weekends to enforce the rules, including no burning.
 Commission member Bob Sedoma estimates that the town is losing about $500 every weekend by people who think they're going to "beat the system by getting down there earlier."
 "We've got to run it like a business," Sedoma said, and that means everyone who is supposed to pay has to pay.
 The gatekeeper arrives at 9 a.m., but there is no gate to keep people from entering the beach before the gatehouse opens. There are homes at the far end of the beach so there is no gate across the road that can be locked at night.
 The beach has been busier than usual this season.
 Recreation Director Sarah Dwyer said they've already gone through 2,000 day passes at Fogland.
 Residents can get a free resident sticker for a car registered in town, but any non-resident is charged $10 on weekdays and $15 on weekends to park. Motorcycles are $5 and recreational vehicles are $25.
 Last weekend, the beach was at capacity. Cars were turned away because there were no more parking spaces, said Gilfillen.

They hated the cars that picked me up and dropped me off when I refused to ride the bus with the little Visigoths. They hated me singing in class. (Yes, I was that kind of nerd.) They hated the lobster-salad sandwiches in my fancy leather lunchbox. They had peanut butter in a paper bag. And riding my bike to school? Out of the question. There were parts of Railroad Avenue that presented a gantlet of bullies. I might have made it to school, but I and my chrome-plated Schwinn would likely be dripping with vegetal detritus.

Granbury, Texas- Barbara Locke Richards Stevens, 83, passed away July 9, 2020, in Granbury, Texas. Just like she planned it. In a comfortable room with a bookcase full of books, trail mix on the table, frig full of cokes, and her favorite pictures on the wall. (Of course she did.)She was born Barbara Locke in 1937 to two loving parents Carl &amp; Mae Locke, in Littlefield, Texas. Barbara attended Crescent Drive Church of Christ. She grew up on a little cotton farm knowing how to pick cotton, hoe weeds, pluck a chicken, and cook cornbread. But she would rather stay inside and read.Barbara was the oldest of three children (much to her delight). She didn't like having Carlene as a little sister. Barbara would get her caregivers laughing with the stories about her and Carlene. She adored her little brother Lloyd. She always wished Lloyd would come walking through the front door at Christmas unannounced just one more time. Barbara was later blessed with another sister, Nancy Dow. Barbara would organize family reunions around the holidays. (Of course she would.)Barbara graduated from West Texas State College with a Bachelor's degree (English) and marriage to Bill Richards in 1959. Barbara was blessed with two children Andy and Mark. She graduated from Texas Woman's University with a Master's degree in Library Science in 1966. They moved to Levelland, Texas, where Barbara was always organizing something. She was a cub scout leader and book club leader. (Of course she was.) She attended Cactus Drive Church of Christ and made many life-long friends.Barbara was the K-12 librarian for Sundown ISD for 27 years from 1975 to 2002. She did a little bit of everything from repairing books, running AV equipment, and directing one- act play. (Of course she did.) She often spoke of the teachers she counted as her friends. She had a real love-hate relationship with the coaches, especially Burnell Stevens. I don't think she ever got over them teasing her about the "Cheap Trick" concert tee ('81, All Shook Up Tour) she borrowed from Andy to wear for dress-up day. How was she supposed to know what the name meant? She tried her best to make a positive change in every student's life or at least warp them a little. When she found the occasional Playboy magazine, she would paste paper doll outfits on all the pictures and return it to the hiding place in hopes that someone would read the magazine articles. It was her library after all.She taught library sciences at Texas Tech University during the summer semesters back in the 1980s. She mostly used these classes to indoctrinate the next generation of librarians "the right way" to run a library. (Of course she did.)Barbara was preceded in death by her father Carl 1974, her mother Mae 2006, her brother Lloyd 1991, and her sister Carlene 2010.Survivors include her sister Nancy Dow Yandell, two children Andy Richards and Mark Richards, and two grandchildren, Seth Richards and Haden Richards. She was blessed to have Kathy as her best friend. Kathy was always there, through thick and thin, with every move, and who stayed with her every step of the way until she couldn't remember anymore.The family suggests memorials to your local library, Alzheimer's Research, or the charity of your choice.

Orange Peel Bakery. What’s funny is my cameraman and I were just reminiscing about some of this. (laughs) In the pie show we visited Woodruffs Pie Shop in rural Virginia. It’s an African American family and they’ve been running this little gas station and pie shop. First it was a gas station and the matriarch in the family, who’s now I think 103 and still alive, she sold sweet potato pie and now they do all kinds of pies. It’s just been really wonderful knowing them. When we got there, we were shooting and someone mentioned “Sometimes we sing.” It’s just one of those things, the luck of the Irish or something. I said, “What do you mean you sing?” It was amazing. It was three sisters and a mother and one extra employee, but the harmonies like that only exist within a family where the voices blend so perfectly and they sang a song called “I’ll Search Heaven For You.” It was just so wonderful, it was amazing. That’s in “A Few Good Pie Places.” That was really great. We look on that as one of our best days of shooting. But there were so many. We loved learning about bagels in Juneau, Alaska, too. But I think that place is closed.

CHARLES "CHUCK" WAYNE WHITE Bettendorf Charles Wayne White, known to family and friends as Chuck, passed from this life at his Bettendorf, Iowa, home on July 8, 2020. He was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on May 30, 1931, to Harold Howard and Clella Mae (Donelson) White. The family lived in Lamoni, Iowa, and that's where, the summer before his freshman year in high school, Chuck was offered a pretzel by a beautiful young girl as he mowed his grandmother's yard. He would go on to be class president and compete in football, basketball and track for Lamoni Community Schools. Five years after meeting on the lawn, Chuck and Kathryn JoAnn DeLong were married on July 22, 1950. Chuck attended Graceland College and later the University of Iowa, where he graduated with a degree in business, marketing and economics and solidified his lifelong love of the Hawkeyes. Following graduation, he joined the family business, White Motor Co., which served as one of the oldest Ford dealerships in the state of Iowa up to the time of its closing. Chuck and Jo lived for many years in Lamoni, where he was a respected community member. He always credited Jo with being the best influence on his life, and at age 27, he joined the priesthood of the RLDS (Community of Christ) Church, being first called as an elder and later as a high priest. He also served on the Lamoni Stake Bishopric group. Chuck served 14 years on the city council. In 1991, Chuck and Jo left Lamoni for Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Chuck worked for 23 years as a car salesman with Zimmerman Ford. An eternal optimist, Chuck was known to have a smile that lit up his sparkling blue eyes. His devotion to his wife and family never flagged, even when the pandemic required them to maintain physical distance. Chuck and Jo were finally able to meet again in person the day before his peaceful passing. Chuck was preceded in death by his parents; and his brother, Bill. He is survived by his wife of 70 years, Kathryn JoAnn White; two children, Pamela White of Davenport, and Laura Craft (Neil) of Unionville, Mo.; and grandchildren Les Wight (Hallie) of St. Louis, Mo., Brian Craft of St. Genevieve, Mo., Nathan Craft of Des Moines and Katie Hallman (Cavan) of Cedar Rapids. Other survivors include three great- grandchildren. Chuck will be remembered for his incredible commitment to faith and family, for his kindness, his generosity and for his warm laugh. A memorial service will be held in Lamoni at a later date. Those wishing to send remembrances may address them to Kathryn JoAnn White, in care of the Kahl Home, 6701 Jersey Ridge Rd., Davenport, IA 52807. Online condolences may be expressed to the family at www.sladefuneralhome.com.

Faith was a big part of the relationship between Earl Morris and Jimmy Moebes.
 Morris was the basketball coach at Austinville in 1958 who had the faith to play the inexperienced Moebes. Austinville went on to win the state championship that season, and Moebes was the state tournament MVP.
 “He hit a growth spurt in the summer before that season,” Morris said. “He had always been a good shooter, and I thought if he got the chance to play he could be really good.”
 What worked in 1958 worked again in 1959. Austinville won its third straight state championship. Moebes was again the state tournament MVP.
 Flash forward 46 years to 2005, and it was Dr. James D. Moebes, minister at the First Baptist Church in Mountain Brook, who stepped up for his former coach during a time that could have tested anyone’s faith. Morris’ son Joe died after a brief illness.
 “We were at Brookwod Hospital for four days, and Jimmy never left us except to go home and shower,” Morris said. “He helped Olga and I get through those horrible days. Plus he helped us prepare for the days after that.”
 Moebes died Tuesday at age 78 after a lengthy illness. A private service for his family was held Friday.
 While Moebes’ church mourns the loss of a man who led his congregation for nearly four decades, his family, friends and fans in Decatur mourn the loss of a basketball player who had a part in the history of the legendary Austinville Hornets.
 “My mother was good friends with his family, so I knew him growing up,” Austinville teammate Wayne Bowling said. “He spent a lot of time working on his game like everybody did in those days. We had a saying to never shoot if you don’t have it. Seemed like Jimmy always had it.”
 Moebes’ specialty was the set shot. There was no jump to it. It was get the ball, set up and shoot.
 Austinville won its first state championship in 1953 with Joe Jones as coach. Morris took over the program in 1956, and the Hornets won three straight state championships. This was back in the day when there were only two classifications.
 The final championship in 1959 was probably the most dramatic. Before the school year started, it had been announced that the high school students from Austinville would be going to Decatur in the fall of 1959. So on top of the pressure of going for a three-peat, there was the fact it was the school’s last season ever.
 “There wasn’t a player on that team that didn’t think we were going to win that third championship,” Bowling said.
 The Hornets were stacked with talent. Jimmy Wallace and Hamil Martin were the guards. Moebes, Bowling and George White were forwards. Billy Ray Howell was the center.
 Stories in The Daily described how the Hornets thrived on team play. There was no ego involved in who did the scoring. It could be any player on any given night.
 Austinville took a 28-2 record to the state tournament at Foster Auditorium on the University of Alabama campus. The Hornets whipped Straughn, Notasulga and Uriah to advance to the championship game vs. Corner. A big third quarter broke up a close game that Austinville won 62-51.
 Moebes would recall the final seconds of the game in 1995 when he was inducted into the Morgan County Sports Hall of Fame.
 “I lost track of time and I was just out there playing as hard as I could,” Moebes said. “The next thing I know, Jimmy Wallace is jumping on my back. I wondered why until I looked at the scoreboard. There were only 20 seconds left and we were up by 12.”
 According to Bowling, the hugs after the game were as much for relief as celebration.
 “We had a lot of people counting on us, and we didn’t want to let them down,” Bowling said.
 Austinville’s record during the three-year run was 96-5.
 Moebes picked up his second straight MVP award after scoring 80 points in the four games. His 31 vs. Straughn was just five short of a then tournament record.
 During the state tournament, Moebes told Morris that he had accepted an offer to play basketball at Vanderbilt. During the following summer he decided to instead play at Howard College (now Samford) and pursue a degree in ministerial studies.
 After four seasons at Howard, Moebes ended his playing career as the school’s all-time scoring leader.
 Through the years, Morris and Moebes remained close friends.
 “I have so many great memories of Jimmy,” Morris said. “He was a special person.”

Jared Gibble had an array of scholarship offers to choose from, including four Ivy League schools.
   
 The Oak Grove rising senior tight end eventually gave a verbal commitment to Charlotte on April 10 and let everybody know on social media.
   
 But in a world where everyone is dealing with COVID-19, nothing is certain these days. Gibble, listed as a three-star recruit, is planning to graduate early from Oak Grove in December and enroll in college next January to get a jump start on his career at the next level.
   
 Before that, there is the matter of his senior season. The status of fall sports is uncertain since the NCHSAA pushed the start back until at least Sept. 1 due to COVID-19.
   
 "As of right now, I still plan on graduating in Dec. 2020," Gibble said. "With so many unknowns due to COVID, I am unsure how or if my college plans will be affected. We are anxiously waiting to find out if we will have a fall season."
   
 Gibble and his teammates were able to resume summer workouts on July 6 and at present those sessions will continue.
   
 After a junior season that saw him gain 2019 Dispatch All-Davidson County and All-Central Carolina Conference honors, the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder's recruiting profile rose rapidly. Princeton, Dartmouth, Yale and Penn made him offers. So did West Point and the Air Force Academy. Furman, Alabama A&M;, Coastal Carolina, Holy Cross, Campbell, Lehigh, Western Carolina, Bucknell, Richmond, Fordham and Akron also made offers.
   
 Ultimately, the choice was close to home.
   
 "I have a great relationship with the coaching staff and I feel like they have a plan for me," Gibble said. "After talking with my family and high school coaches, I felt like it was the right decision to commit to Charlotte."
   
 The 49ers were 7-6 in 2019 and played in the Bahamas Bowl.
   
 "He has really liked them since they first offered," said Oak Grove coach Mark Holcomb. "He has been down there a few times and feels comfortable with their staff. They are getting a good one."
   
 At the same time, Gibble is preparing for whatever may come his way and the possibility things could change.
   
 "Right now I still intend on following the early graduation path," Gibble said. "But due to to so many unknowns in our future, I will not rule out any options."

Now, I need to tell you about my Saturday mornings. In the first and second grades, Saturday mornings took me back to a toddler’s sense of “what’s next.” I preferred my time to be unstructured, of course. I was free; free to rearrange the den furniture into a fort. Free to break a thermometer and experiment with the little balls of mercury. It was as if I intuited at age 8 that freedom to roam would make me a more creative, fulfilled adult.
 But, a confrontation loomed in the near future. I had a bull’s-eye on my back. And the people who ran Our Lady of the Midlife Crisis Catholic Church held the bow and arrow. My father had promised a priest that if they let him marry this Protestant woman, he would see to it that his children were instructed in whatever the Catholic Church had to teach. Alarm bells were going off.

PALM BEACH GARDENS -- Office space has been tough to find for the faith-based foster care organization Place of Hope.
   
 But after three years of negotiation and construction, more than 18,000 square feet of space is about to become available at the new Lane Center on Northlake Boulevard just west of Military Trail.
   
 Construction is nearly complete on the $6.6 million complex that will be used for executive offices for Place of Hope and a handful of other tenants.
   
 The nonprofit is building the complex on land previously occupied by a pair of blighted homes, said Charles Bender, Place of Hope's CEO.
   
 Palm Beach County commissioners changed the zoning of the land in 2018, clearing the way for Place of Hope to build its new office complex, which will include two buildings separated by a breezeway.
   
 The nonprofit will occupy a portion of both buildings, and will lease the remaining space to make money to pay for its programs for foster youth, homeless youth and families, Bender said.
   
 A handful of tenants already have committed to renting space at the complex, including Wall Private Wealth, Inc., and the Berlin Family Foundation.
   
 Those tenants, as with others that are considering renting the remaining space, are longtime supporters of Place of Hope, Bender said.
   
 Founded in 1999, Palm Beach Gardens-based Place of Hope provides family-style foster care, family outreach and intervention, adoption and foster care recruitment, and transitional housing and support services for abused, abandoned and neglected children and families in need.
   
 "We're going to be able to have our supporters engage with the community and with members of our team, and we really think that's going to generate interest in Place of Hope," Bender said. "It's the whole idea of a social enterprise.
   
 "We're a non-profit doing things like a for-profit type of venture, but at the end of the day, it just really funnels right into taking care of kids. That's really the most exciting part."
   
 With more than 345 abused children, homeless youth, pregnant teens and human trafficking survivors in daily residential care spanning six counties, Place of Hope has grown into the largest traditional foster home provider in the area.
   
 More than 90 full-time and part-time employees work on multiple campuses, and more space was needed for offices, training and other ancillary uses, Bender said.
   
 "Up in the Treasure Coast we rent some space, and we built a building in Martin County," Bender said. "And down here, we needed space for headquarters, and also for our Palm Beach County staff."
   
 The Lane Center will provide plenty of space when it opens next month.
   
 "We're at the point now where it's going to be 4, 5, 6 weeks just to get all the pretty stuff done," Bender said. "But the heavy stuff is just about done."
