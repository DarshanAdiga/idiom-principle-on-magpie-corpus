ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Roanoke City announced major changes to its back-to-school plan Thursday, August 6. Almost all students would now be online-only when class starts back later this month.‚ÄúWhen it comes to that data, we can‚Äôt be tone deaf,‚Äù Roanoke City Superintendent Verletta White said.According to White, this change all comes down to space.With substantial community transmission of COVID-19 in Roanoke, students and teachers would need to be six-feet apart at all times, something White says would have been too disruptive.‚ÄúMoving teachers out of their buildings, or moving students into other buildings that they‚Äôre not accustomed to,‚Äù White said.Under the new plan, almost all students - prekindergarten-through-12th grade - will be learning virtually for the first nine weeks of class. If conditions improve, prekindergarten-through-5th grade will be back in class two days a week for that second nine weeks. If they keep improving, all students will be back four days a week - the original plan - by January.‚ÄúHopefully when we get to the moderate range, or the low range, and we‚Äôre hoping that‚Äôs before the second quarter, we can bring more students into the school house,‚Äù White said.Parents would also be welcome to keep their kids virtual all year.White says the division‚Äôs Virtual Academy is up and running, and all students will have access to a laptop, and internet access through a partnership with Cox.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready. We‚Äôre ready for virtual instruction, that type of robust learning,‚Äù she said.Childcare options for parents are still in the works. Earlier in the week, city officials said hundreds of people still need to by hired to make that a reality.However, some students will still be in class in person later this month.‚ÄúWe are bringing in-person students with special needs who spend more than 50% of their day in the special education setting, as well as our level one English learners,‚Äù White said.White says there will also be an opportunity for students who may need remedial learning to have some face-to- face time with teachers.The plan is still preliminary. The Roanoke City School Board will vote on it Tuesday, August 11.Copyright 2020 WDBJ. All rights reserved.

Maxwell Murrell      Montgomery, TX - Maxwell Rogers Murrell, 91 years of age, of Montgomery, TX, died on July 28th, 2020. He was born in Coleman, TX, on December 8th, 1928, to Carl and Zelma Murrell. He lived in Sweetwater, Texas for most of his early years, and later moved to Dallas, TX, where he graduated from North Dallas High School. He then attended Southern Methodist University, where he graduated with BBA in Business Management. In 1949 he then received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, and graduated in 1953 with a BS Degree in Civil Engineering. He spent the next 3 ¬Ω years in the army, serving in Korea and Japan with the 82nd Airborne Division in Fayetteville, NC.      While there, in Fayetteville, NC, Max met and married, Jane L. Orcutt, on January 27th, 1957, and they began their married life in Hamlin, TX, where he began his career in the automobile business. In April 1963, he purchased the Chevrolet Dealership in Merkel, TX, and continued to manage and operate that business until he retired in March 1994.      While Max and his family were living in Merkel, TX, he was an active member of the First United Methodist Church, and participated in many local activities and civic organizations. He was a past President of the Merkel Optimist Club, the Merkel Lions Club, the Sun Water Development Board, and past Secretary of the Merkel Industrial Development Board. He was a member of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce. He was a director of Caballero Life Insurance Company and served several years as secretary for that company. During his years as a Chevrolet dealer he won many awards and received recognition many times for his various business achievements.      In 1995, Max and Jane moved to Walden on Lake Conroe, Montgomery, TX, where he continued to serve in his church, and on the Walden MUD 9 Water Board. Max was a life-long Methodist, and a member of the Montgomery United Methodist Church.      Max is survived by his wife, Jane, through 63 years of married life; his daughter, Kathryn, and her husband, Mark Deyo, of Montgomery, TX, and his daughter-in-law, Vicki Murrell, of Virden, IL, and grandchildren, Brandon, of Alvarado, TX, Lacee, of Spring, TX, and step-grandchildren, Tonya, of Midland, TX, Michael, of Little Elm, TX, David, of Searcy, AR, Mark Jr., of Odessa, TX, Jamie, of Virden, IL, Jeremy, of Virden, IL, and 14 great grandchildren, and 6 great great grandchildren.      Max was a man of tireless energy, optimism, enthusiasm, and good humor: a man who was always ready to lend a helping hand, and who made the world a kinder, better place for those with whom he came in contact. His greatest enjoyment in life came from his wife, his family, golfing with friends, and traveling to various parts of the world. God richly blessed Max with the ability to work and provide a comfortable living for his family, and with the good health to enjoy a long and fulfilling life.      A celebration of his life will be held later due to the Covid-19 Virus.

The most important part of the NEP is the expenditure on education. Currently India spends 3% of its GDP on education and ranks 62nd in total public expenditure on education per student. That amount will go up to 6%, but even that is not enough. If we want to become a "developed" nation, we must increase our allocation for education substantially. Finally, the implementation of this policy is left to the states, as education is a concurrent subject. I hope politics does not get the better of what is essential for our society.

NEW DELHI (AP) ‚Äî An Air India Express flight with 190 people on board skidded off a runway and split in two while landing Friday in heavy rain in southern India. Police said at least 14 people were killed and 123 others injured. Abdul Karim, a senior Kerala state police officer, said the dead included one of the pilots. He said at least 15 of the injured were in critical condition, and that rescue operations were over. Rajiv Jain, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Ministry, said no fire was reported on the Boeing 737 aircraft after it landed and broke into two pieces. The NDTV news channel said the plane flew from Dubai to Kozhikode, also called Calicut, in the state of Kerala in southern India. It was a repatriation flight carrying Indian citizens back to the country, officials said. Regular commercial flights have been halted in India because of the coronavirus outbreak. Jain said there were 174 adult passengers, 10 infants, two pilots and four cabin crew on board the aircraft. Amitabh Kant, who heads the government's planning commission, said the runway is on a hilltop with deep gorges on either side, making it difficult to land. ‚ÄúThe incident happened because of heavy rains and poor visibility. This is truly devastating,‚Äù he told NDTV. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he was ‚Äúpained by the plane accident in Kozhikode,‚Äù and that he had spoken to Kerala‚Äôs top elected official. Air India Express is a subsidiary of Air India.

The precise reason for the decision is not known. However, it is understood that EFL officials have been trying to get proof of funding from East Street Investments, the company that bought Charlton from Roland Duchatelet in January.


  ESI was originally owned by Tahnoon Nimer and Matt Southall but after the pair fell out and Nimer refused to put any more funding into the club, Elliott stepped in to buy it in June. However, in a court case the following month, Farnell admitted the sale had still not been completed.


  Farnell's status has been the subject of increasing scrutiny amongst Charlton fans.


  Police had to be called to his offices in Hale on Friday after a number of supporters gained entry and demanded answers about the running of the club. No arrests were made, although it was reported after the fans had been moved on that some pushing and shoving had taken place.


  Former Southampton manager Dave Jones was in the office at the time discussing a role at Charlton, although it is understood it would not involve replacing any current members of staff.


  BBC Sport has also established the Solicitors' Regulation Authority is investigating a complaint made about Farnell.


  It is understood that allegations have been made that Farnell has conflict of interest by acting on behalf of both parties in the potential sale of the club.


  Farnell has said on social media that the "accusation is not true". The SRA has indicated it could decide 'to commence a formal investigation which could lead to sanctions or restrictions' or it could choose 'to not take any formal action at this time'.


  BBC Sport has been told Farnell's stake in Charlton would be minimal, that he and Elliott regard the EFL's decision as being related to a technical breach and an appeal has already been submitted.


  Should the appeal not be successful, it would put Charlton and the EFL in a difficult position given the owners of the club would have no authority to run it on a day-to-day basis.


  In their statement, the EFL said: "Every submission under the Owners' and Directors' Test is reviewed by the EFL using a variety of sources including external databases, and in appropriate cases, the EFL commissions external providers to conduct more detailed research."


  Earlier on Friday, before the EFL decision was released, the Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust wrote to Elliot and urged him to "come clean" and explain why he had not met EFL regulations.


  "We don't demand the release of commercially sensitive detail but surely, we deserve better than the fog of bland and empty reassurance that is all we have been offered so far," the letter said.

Major cities across the country have seen a leap in violence this year as the stresses of the coronavirus pandemic and unrest over racial injustice build.
 Will New Jersey follow suit? That‚Äôs a possibility that drew worry last month from the acting superintendent of state police, Col. Patrick Callahan, who noted that as he spoke, New Jersey had seen a 19% increase in fatal shootings compared to the same time period in 2019.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre certainly concerned about it,‚Äù Callahan said at a July 15 news briefing. ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre seeing way too many shootings, and the likelihood of it continuing through the warm summer months gives us a tremendous amount of concern.‚Äù
 Statewide, a total of 104 people have been killed as of July 19, according to state police data released last week. Twenty-seven communities across New Jersey saw at least one person die of gun violence. Another 476 people were injured.
 The numbers were driven by New Jersey‚Äôs population centers, with three cities already recording killings in the double digits. Newark, the state‚Äôs largest city, had 21 deaths. Trenton had 19 deaths. And Paterson had 13 deaths ‚Äî including the bloodiest single event, a July 7 shooting in which four people were killed and three were injured.

Many historians, including respected American scholars, have verified that the atomic bombing of Japan had nothing to do with swiftly ending the Pacific War and ‚Äúsaving U.S. lives‚Äù. It was simply an act of unspeakable barbarism for political aims to do with winning the anticipated Cold War. The bombs were dropped just as the Soviet Red Army entered the Korean Peninsula to augment the fight against Japanese imperial forces, as was previously agreed by Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill at the Yalta conference of war-time allies back in February 1945. However, by the time of August 1945, Washington and London had moved considerably to adopt a more hostile position against Moscow, with a view to challenging the Soviet Union for spheres of influence in the postwar world.

Any presidential candidate, and particularly one who will be 78 on inauguration day, needs to choose someone ready to step into the job at a moment‚Äôs notice. That someone needs to have governing experience. She needs to have endured the pitiless spotlight of national politics. She needs to be broadly acceptable to swing voters. And she needs to be someone the president trusts completely.
 Among the women who meet the above tests, there are problems. Sen. Kamala Harris has been exposed to the scrutiny a campaign brings, but she forfeited some trust with Biden by aiming an insulting charge at him, suggesting that he allied with racists on busing decades ago.
 Susan Rice has a distinguished record of public service but has never run for anything. She is also, potentially, quite a lightning rod. She misled the country about what had happened in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, and Trump partisans believe she was part of a conspiracy to damage the incoming Trump administration. The latter accusation against her is mostly rubbish but could cause a needless sideshow in the fall.
 Rep. Karen Bass heads the Congressional Black Caucus. People like and respect her, even Republicans. But some troubling statements and associations have surfaced. In 2010, she spoke at the opening of a huge Scientology Center in Los Angeles. Questioned about this, she tweeted last weekend that she had appeared there because the center was in her district ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt much of an explanation. But that wasn‚Äôt even true. She tweeted on Aug. 5 that she ‚Äúregrets the error.‚Äù
 Bass eulogized Oneil Marion Cannon as a ‚Äúfriend and mentor‚Äù in 2017 without mentioning that he was a long-time member of the Communist Party USA. As a young adult, she was a member of the Venceremos (‚Äúwe shall triumph‚Äù) Brigade, a pro-Castro group, and traveled to Cuba eight times in the 1970s. When Castro died, Bass released a statement of condolences to the Castro family and the Cuban people: ‚ÄúThe passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.‚Äù
 Look, Donald Trump has said equally appalling things about Kim Jong Un. The Republican Party that stands with Trump is hardly in a position to throw stones at Bass.
 And yet, we are told that part of what made Trump possible was the tendency on the right to look the other way about the extremists, kooks and unsavory elements within their own ranks. The same rule should apply to Democrats. Besides, choosing such a confirmed leftist would alarm the centrist voters Biden will need.
 Time for a closer look at Senator Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Rep. Val Demings. Duckworth‚Äôs likability and story of heroism and sacrifice are powerful. Val Demings is a former police chief. The disadvantage is that there is no police department in which stories of wrongdoing will not surface. But the upsides are greater. Who better than an African American former cop to address questions of police brutality with sensitivity? And who can accuse the Democrats of being the party of ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù with Val Demings on the ticket?
 Biden is about to become the Democratic nominee because he was perceived to be safe. He should choose someone just as safe for VP.

Several other Boise State players followed in sharing the letter including cornerback Jalen Walker and quarterback Chase Cord.


  The Mountain West issued a response to the letter later Thursday night that said ‚Äúnearly all of the issues which have been raised are already being addressed.‚Äù


  The league went on to say ‚Äúthe Mountain West‚Äôs revised fall sports plan will align with the requirements set forth by the NCAA Board of Governors. In addition, the MW continues to develop comprehensive testing and reporting procedures‚Ä¶‚Äù


  The Mountain West statement added, ‚Äúadditional clarity will be provided via upcoming decisions of the NCAA Division I Board of Directors on August 14 and August 21, as well as on-going efforts by multiple groups within the Mountain West governance structure. The Mountain West and its member institutions value the input of our most important constituents, our student-athletes, and look forward to continued communication with our long-standing MW Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.‚Äù


  It's unclear if the players would be willing to boycott the season should all the demands not be met, or if the league plans to meet with representatives for the group like the Pac-12 did during a Zoom call on Thursday.

In separate letters, two Montana Republicans, Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte, also urged the Postal Service to reverse the July directive, which eliminates overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers and mandates that mail be kept until the next day if distribution centers are running late.
 And 84 House members ‚Äî including four Republicans ‚Äî signed yet another letter blasting the changes and urging an immediate reversal.
 "Delaying mail service is unacceptable," Gianforte wrote Thursday to DeJoy. "Do not continue down this road."
 In their letter, the 84 House members said it is "vital that the Postal Service does not reduce mail delivery hours, which could harm rural communities, seniors, small businesses and millions of Americans who rely on the mail for critical letters and packages.'' The letter was led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, who has called DeJoy to testify at a hearing next month.
 The flurry of letters came as the top Democrat on a Senate panel that oversees the Postal Service launched an investigation into the operational changes.
 Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said DeJoy has failed to provide answers about the service delays, despite repeated requests.
 Peters is asking the public to provide their stories about delays or other problems with deliveries.
 The Postal Service is reeling from mail delays and financial problems at a time when record numbers of mail ballots are expected in the November presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Trump, a vocal critic of the Postal Service, contended Wednesday that "the Post Office doesn't have enough time" to handle a significant increase in mail-in ballots. "I mean you're talking about millions of votes. .. It's a catastrophe waiting to happen."
 DeJoy met with Schumer and Pelosi Wednesday in a closed-door session that Schumer called "a heated discussion." Democrats told DeJoy that "elections are sacred" and urged him not to impose cutbacks "at a time when all ballots count," Schumer said.
 In his remarks to the postal board of governors, DeJoy disputed reports that the agency is slowing down election mail or any other mail. He called election mail handling "a robust and proven process."
 While there will "likely be an unprecedented increase in election mail volume due to the pandemic, the Postal Service has ample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on time in accordance with our delivery standards, and we will do so," DeJoy said. "However ... we cannot correct the errors of (state and local) election boards if they fail to deploy processes that take our normal processing and delivery standards into account."
 Democrats have pushed for $10 billion for the Postal Service in talks with Republicans on a huge COVID-19 response bill. The figure is down from a $25 billion plan in a House-passed coronavirus measure. Key Republicans whose rural constituents are especially reliant on the post office support the idea.

LeNissa Rivera, Corps Officer at The Salvation Army in Newport, has been promoted to captain. Rivera moved to Newport in July of 2019, following four successful years as the Corps Officer of the Meriden, Conn., Corps.


   


  Since moving to Newport one year ago, she has overseen The Salvation Army's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has provided direct support to more than 3,000 people in Newport County - including Newport, Middletown, Portsmouth, Jamestown, Little Compton and Tiverton.


   


  Rivera has also guided the implementation of the Pathway to Hope program in Newport, which provides support to families that wish to overcome intergenerational poverty. Rivera is a gifted musician, working with Newport young people in confidence building through the enhancement of their musical skills.


   


  "Captain Rivera's leadership is both inspirational and effective," said Major Roger Duperree, divisional secretary for The Salvation Army in Rhode Island, in a statement. "She has the unique ability to look beyond the bag of groceries or the clothing voucher she is handing someone and speak to the heart of the people she serves. We have profound respect and admiration for the compassion she serves with, as well as, her professional abilities!"


   


  Rivera has always been a part of The Salvation Army. She first started attending when she was 3 years old. She was able to make wonderful friends and memories because of the experiences and opportunities gained in the Army. As a child of a single-parent home, it was hard to be able to experience life outside of her immediate neighborhood. "The Salvation Army's Camp CONNRI was the place where I found myself and my identity in God," Rivera said in a statement. "It was where I made my first real commitment to accepting God in my life. It opened up my eyes as a camper to the beauty of creation, and as a staff member, it helped me to be a light and positive example to the young campers who were looking to experience the same things I did."


   


  Rivera truly did not realize what an impact The Salvation Army could make in a person's life until years later when she fell on hard times herself. Due to unforeseen circumstances, she found herself alone with her two daughters, without a home, car or employment -- nothing to call their own. She was devastated and did not know what to do next. It was then that she sought out The Salvation Army in a completely different way. "The Salvation Army helped me at one of the lowest points in my life," Captain Rivera said. "Ultimately, I was hired by the Army and one of my first assignments was to plan a music program at Camp CONNRI. Imagine my delight to return right back to the place where my life began!"


   


  Twenty years have passed since she began working for The Salvation Army and Captain Rivera's life has come full circle. Her eldest daughter, Tatyana, is following in her footsteps and is entering her second year at The Salvation Army College for Officer Training. Her youngest daughter, Julia, is entering her junior year at Salve Regina University and is majoring in social work.


   


  Rivera is eternally grateful for the ministry of The Salvation Army. "I feel like God, through The Salvation Army, has given me the opportunity to make a difference in this world," said Rivera. "I couldn't imagine doing anything else."


   


  Rivera holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Multidisciplinary Studies from Liberty University and is due to obtain her Graduate Degree from Asbury Theological Seminary in Pastoral Counseling in May of 2021.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The U.S. Postal Service says it lost $2.2 billion in the three months that ended in June as the beleaguered agency ‚Äî hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äî piles up financial losses that officials warn could top $20 billion over two years.‚ÄúOur financial position is dire, stemming from substantial declines in mail volume, a broken business model and a management strategy that has not adequately addressed these issues,‚Äô' Louis DeJoy, the new postmaster general, said Friday in his first public remarks since taking the job in June."Without dramatic change, there is no end in sight,'' DeJoy told the postal board of governors at a meeting Friday.Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is seen leaving meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.While package deliveries to homebound Americans were up more than 50%, that was offset by continued declines in first-class and business mail, even as costs increased significantly to pay for personal protective equipment and replace workers who got sick or chose to stay home in fear of the virus, DeJoy said. Without an intervention from Congress, the agency faces an impending cash flow crisis, he said. The Postal Service is seeking an infusion of at least $10 billion to cover operating losses as well as regulatory changes that would undo a congressional requirement that the agency pre-fund billions of dollars in retiree health benefits.The agency is doing its part, said DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser and former supply chain executive who took command of the agency June 15. DeJoy, 63, of North Carolina, is a major donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. He is the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who is not a career postal employee.In his first month on the job, DeJoy said, he directed the agency to vigorously "focus on the ingrained inefficiencies in our operations,'' including by applying strict limits on overtime. "By running our operations on time and on schedule, and by not incurring unnecessary overtime or other costs, we will enhance our ability to be sustainable and ... continue to provide high-quality, affordable service,'' DeJoy said.While not acknowledging widespread complaints by members of Congress about delivery delays nationwide, DeJoy said the agency will "aggressively monitor and quickly address service issues.''DeJoy‚Äôs remarks came as lawmakers from both parties called on the Postal Service to immediately reverse operational changes that are causing delays in deliveries across the country just as big volume increases are expected for mail-in election voting.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that changes imposed by DeJoy "threaten the timely delivery of mail ‚Äî including medicines for seniors, paychecks for workers and absentee ballots for voters ‚Äî that is essential to millions of Americans.''In separate letters, two Montana Republicans, Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte, also urged the Postal Service to reverse the July directive, which eliminates overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers and mandates that mail be kept until the next day if distribution centers are running late.And 84 House members ‚Äî including four Republicans ‚Äî signed yet another letter blasting the changes and urging an immediate reversal."Delaying mail service is unacceptable," Gianforte wrote Thursday to DeJoy.
