PLYMOUTH - The summer between junior and senior year is a crucially important time for a high school student. It's when you have the free time to visit a college campus or two, do some research on prospective colleges and begin to set down the path that will lead you into your adult life.
 If you're an elite athlete looking for the right place to continue on that road the summer before your senior year is also huge. It's the time when you want the most college eyes on you. You play in the Bay State Games, go to every possible invitational tournament, write multitudes of emails, send out highlight videos of your top plays and basically do whatever you possibly can to get the attention of the college coach of your choice.
 At least that's the game plan. But then you throw in the travel and safety restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and as they say, game plans sometimes change. Actual in-person visits by prospective athletes are replaced by virtual online school tours as well as Zoom calls with college coaches and their staffs.
 Plymouth North's Cam Shaughnessy and Plymouth South's Hunter Dean are both rising seniors. They compete against each other on the football field as well as the basketball court but one big thing they share together is the drive to play sports at the next level. Shaughnessy wants to play football while Dean hopes to continue to play both football and baseball or stick with one sport at a higher college level.
 Both young men say that they are willing to take their time while doing their homework about which college path is best for them.
 "The Zoom calls have been interesting. You need to come to the interviews prepared and know what questions you have for a coach when you get them on a call," said Dean, who has already talked with Bentley University, Franklin Pierce and Worcester State among other colleges. "I talk with the schools about where they see me fitting into their program. I've also watched a lot of virtual campus tour videos about the things that their school can offer, both for athletics and academics."
 While it's hard for the videos to replace the actual feel of being there in person on a college campus, Dean said they do offer a flavor of what he'd be walking into if he chose to attend there.
 Dean's now up to 6-foot-6, 220 pounds and has been working out with Atlantic Sport Performance to improve his strength and speed. He also hopes to get in some time on the diamond this summer with the Ocean State Makos AAU baseball team and play in a 7v7 football league as the Panthers prepare to defend their Patriot League title this fall.
 In baseball he plays first base and is growing by leaps and bounds as a right- handed pitcher. Dean was also the starting quarterback on last year's South football team that made it all the way to the Div. 4 Super Bowl title game.
 "I've got a good idea of what I'm looking for in a college," said Dean, an outdoor enthusiast who wants to major in Environmental Science. "I'd like to find a place where I can still play baseball and football unless I have to choose just one to play at a higher level. I'm looking for somewhere that's more of a small town rather than a big city. I'm also looking for a school that has a nice weight room and a place where I get a good connection with the athletic program."
 Across America's Hometown, you'll usually find Shaughnessy lifting heavy things in the weight room he has in the garage of his house or on the football field at Plymouth North working on his speed and agility.
 Shaughnessy has started on the offensive and defensive line for the Blue Eagles. He's looking to play nose guard or defensive tackle at the next level and at 6'3, 291 pounds with good hands and quick feet that come from his basketball training Shaughnessy checks a lot of boxes that college coaches are looking for in new recruits.
 What he's doing has worked so far as the 6'3, 291 pound lineman already has Division 1 college offers in hand from Air Force as well as Army-West Point. He was invited to attend a prospect camp with Boston College as a junior and has also had Zoom interviews with several other schools.
 "You want to get a flavor of the school campus by being there in person and walking around. That's tough to do from a video tour," Shaughnessy said. "But the Zoom calls with the coaches and the recruiters are good in that you can ask a lot of questions about the philosophy of the program, find out what their training facilities are like as well as where they see you fitting into the big picture.
 "It a process, so you want to take some time and do all your homework and look at all your options before you make a final decision on a college. I'm not going to rush the process. You have to take your time because that's where you are going to spend the next four years of your life," Shaughnessy said. "My parents (Dan and Lynn) have been awesome with helping me go through everything as we work to find the right fit for me."
 Alison Foley has been on both sides of the recruiting process for a while now. The Plymouth native spent 22 years as the winningest head coach in the history of the women's soccer program at Boston College and now helps guide talented athletes and their families through the recruiting process with her business, Foley Athletic Advising.
 "The college search process is different these days (with the Coronavirus pandemic) but it can still work on both ends, for the coach and the player, if it's done right," Foley said. "What a player does during something like COVID-19 as far as their training can actually tell a coach something about them in how well they can handle things when they don't go as planned and how they can adapt when some adversity is put in front of them."
 Foley's biggest suggestion to athletes preparing for the Zoom calls with prospective colleges is to "treat it like a job interview, because that's exactly what it is. Dress appropriately, be professional and above all you want to do your homework before you get on the call so you don't take up time asking questions that could easily be found on the college's website. Coaches will notice how prepared you are and appreciate that you took an interest in finding those things out.
 "Research the school and the athletic program you have an interest in to find out what they are all about," Foley added. "Ask the coach in-depth questions about their coaching philosophy, what their training set-up is like, what kind of academic support they have for their athletes as well as where they see you fitting into their program."
 Shaughnessy and Dean will have no bigger supporters in the college search process than their high school coaches as they navigate the sometimes choppy waters to their next destination.
 Plymouth South baseball coach Walter Fust said Dean "is just starting to reach his potential" on the diamond. "He's a high-ceiling player that has everything a college baseball coach is looking for on the field as well as off the field. Hunter's got tons of talent and he's a natural leader. Teammates are drawn to him as a team leader with the hard work he puts into everything.
 "Hunter was going to do a lot more pitching for us this spring (before the season was canceled) and I think he learns more about being a pitcher each day. He can throw in the mid-80's and he'll only improve with experience," Fust said. "The only thing that kept me from using him more as a pitcher before now is that he's an exceptionally good defensive first baseman and he was the key to our defense. He's got great footwork around the bag and he is really growing into his size."
 Incoming Panthers Head Football Coach Darren Fruzetti knows Dean very well from his time as offensive coordinator for the program.
 "We put him in at quarterback as a sophomore when Keven Paul was injured and Hunter took on the challenge," Fruzetti said. "Like they say, you can't teach size and athleticism and he has both of them. Hunter puts in the work and he gets better every day at things like reading defenses and anticipating what kind of schemes they are going to throw at him.
 "Hunter's growing into the job of being a starting quarterback and he has all the intangibles with the kind of work he puts in and the way his teammates naturally rally around him as a leader."
 Plymouth North Head Football Coach Chris Whidden said Shaughnessy has taken a liking to playing on the defensive side of football and college coaches are going to appreciate the total package that he could potentially bring to their program.
 "Cam has the size and agility to play at any level and the time he's spent playing basketball has given him great hand technique and footwork and strong overall athleticism. And when coaches talk to him they'll find out what a great kid he is," Whidden said. "He's a natural leader, a hard worker and his head is in the right place. He checks all the boxes."

Un très mauvais timing. Alors que la pandémie de Covid-19 avait relativement épargné le Portugal jusqu’ici, alors que l’UEFA a choisi d’organiser le « Final 8 » de la Ligue des champions à Lisbonne du 12 au 23 août prochain, alors que cette solution dans un pays « neutre » qui ne compte plus d’équipes qualifiées semblait épouser les contours de la solution parfaite, voilà que le virus progresse au Portugal. Face à la multiplication des contaminations, le gouvernement portugais a décidé de confiner certains quartiers de la périphérie de Lisbonne. A un peu plus d’un mois de ce qui devait clore en beauté la saison, la situation est plutôt inconfortable.   « Nous espérons que tout ira bien et qu’il sera possible d’organiser le tournoi au Portugal, a précisé l’UEFA à nos confrères de L’Equipe. Pour le moment, il n’y a aucune raison de prévoir un plan B. » Il est beaucoup trop tôt pour prendre des décisions définitives. Toutefois si la situation devait perdurer et s’aggraver, faut-il craindre une délocalisation, un report ou une annulation pure et simple de la compétition ? Du côté de l’organisation portugaise, il n’en est pas question et la ligne est la même qu’à l’UEFA. Les autorités estiment que sans public, il n’y pas de danger majeur. Le championnat portugais a repris son cours et il se déroule à huis clos. Le premier ministre portugais, Antonio Costa, souhaite la même chose pour la suite et la fin de cette Ligue des champions 2019/2020. Pour le moment donc, du côté de l’UEFA comme du côté des organisateurs, l’annulation n’est pas envisagée.

Bournemouth is a great spot. But they are 18th for a reason. They simply cannot score. But they have been off for close to a week while Newcastle played Sunday hosting Man City and now they make the longest trip in the PL - almost 300 miles - for a game against a team in Bournemouth who knows anything less than 3 points here will probably see them relegated at season's end. It would help the Cherries if they actually get a SOG - something they did not do in their last game and in 2 games back have 1 more SOG than I do. This one will not be pleasing to the eyes for purists but if the Cherries win - it will.

 12 Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now
 There are now more than 50 publicly-traded companies operating in the cannabis industry. Most of these companies aren't directly growing and selling marijuana themselves, but they do stand to benefit greatly as more states legalize the sale and possession of marijuana. Some of these marijuana stocks are media companies. Others are privately studying the medical uses of marijuana. Yet others are providing tools and software for marijuana growers. As more cannabis companies file IPOs and enter the stock market, it will become increasingly difficult for investors to identify which marijuana stocks will truly benefit from the cannabis boom.

"Using modulating reheat is one of the best things a dehumidifier can do from an efficiency and patron comfort perspective," said Johnson. "You don't have temperature and relative humidity bounces, and the various unit components experience less stress because they don't cycle on and off. It's a no-brainer but, unfortunately, is not standard in the industry."
