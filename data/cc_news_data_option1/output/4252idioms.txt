LIBERTY, Mo. (AP) — A western Kansas county was forced to suspend in-person advanced voting for three days after a ballot misprint incorrectly identified a Kansas Senate race as a U.S. Senate contest. Ellis County planned to resume in-person voting Thursday with extended hours after corrected ballots arrived Wednesday. The incorrect ballots labeled the Kansas 40th Senate race as a U.S. Senate race. The names of the candidates were correct. About 4,000 of the incorrect ballots were also sent to mail-in voters. Election officials say the incorrect ballots will be counted. The actual U.S. Senate race between Democrat Barbara Bollier and Republican Roger Marshall was correctly identified on the ballot.

Zlatan Ibrahimović is back to his best for the Europa League match at Celtic after recovering from the coronavirus. Ibrahimović returned to training last week and scored two goals as AC Milan beat Inter Milan 2-1 in a Serie A derby on Saturday. Milan is the early leader of the Italian league after winning all four of its opening matches. However, it only reached the Europa League group stage after a nervy 9-8 penalty shootout win over Portuguese club Rio Ave, having netted a fortunate last-gasp equalizer in extra time. Celtic comes into the game on the back of a 2-0 loss to fierce Glasgow rival Rangers in the Scottish league.

Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor at the Reserve Bank of Australia, who is speaking at the Global Foreign Exchange Committee and the FX Global Code - at FX Week Australia 2020, has stated thatone notable feature of this latest crisis was both how sharply market conditions deteriorated and how quickly they recovered. He adds that the actions by central banks and governments around the globe doubtless contributed to this rebound. By and large, he says that the conditions have continued to improve in recent months. ''Many indicators of liquidity are now approaching more normal levels, although the depth of market does remain noticeably below pre-pandemic levels. Conditions are more diverse in emerging market currencies, where more idiosyncratic factors tend to be in play, but overall, conditions have also generally improved in these markets but to a lesser extent.'' There has been no specific reference to the AUD or RBA policy. The full speech can be read here. AUD/USD update AUD/USD climbed to its best levels in a week overnight, 0.7137.

Archewell was originally supposed to launch this past spring but was delayed, like many other large-scale projects, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic affecting the globe. Shifting their focus at the time to COVID-19 relief efforts, the couple have seemingly been able to get back on track with the launch of their nonprofit.
 "Before SussexRoyal, came the idea of 'Arche'--the Greek word meaning 'source of action.' We connected to this concept for the charitable organization we hoped to build one day, and it became the inspiration for our son's name," said the Sussexes in a statement upon the original announcement of Archewell. "To do something of meaning, to do something that matters. Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon."
 Though the royal couple have remained mum on what type of projects are in the works for the Archewell launch, their recent public appearances and vocal support of the Black Lives Matter movement, gender equality, and building a better digital world all reflect the overarching mission of the new organization.

The people behind Topeka's Plug and Play accelerator program are preparing to announce the inaugural cohort of startup businesses that will participate in the program's virtual sessions this fall.
   
 On Wednesday, Topeka held its first Plug and Play selection day, albeit a virtual one, to hear from 10 startups in the running to be selected for the city's Plug and Play accelerator, which focuses on elevating viable startups in the animal health and agricultural technology realm.
   
 The selection day marked the official launch of Topeka's Plug and Play program, which was announced last year. It is the first accelerator program created in partnership with Plug and Play -- a Silicon Valley-based company and self-described "innovation platform," that seeks to find, invest in and advance startups -- that focuses specifically on animal health and agtech.
   
 Founders of 10 early- and mid-stage startup companies in that industry pitched their business concepts Wednesday to a panel of executives from Plug and Play and the local accelerator's founding partners. Those founding partners are Cargill Inc., Hill's Pet Nutrition and Evergy.
   
 Evergy's support for the program was announced during the virtual selection day event, which took place via Zoom. Along with Cargill and Hill's, Evergy will help select, from the 10 startups that presented, the final group of participants in this year's inaugural cohort.
   
 "With this selection day, we begin the first chapter of Plug and Play Topeka," said Katrin Bridges, the Greater Topeka Partnership's senior vice president of innovation. "Forging ahead alongside our influential and invaluable founding partners -- Cargill, Hill's Pet Nutrition and Evergy -- we are setting our sights on soon becoming a hub of innovation in the Midwest."
   
 The entrepreneurs that gave pitches Wednesday represented startups from several U.S. states and Australia, Spain, the U.K. and Sweden.
   
 Those startups were Ceres Tag, Rapid Genomics, Andes Ag, Peeva, Waggit, Volta Greentech, PitPat, Bond Pet Foods, ProAgni and Dinbeat. Their businesses focus on everything from wearable technology that monitors animal health to feed supplements that combat global warming by reducing cow methane emissions.
   
 Bridges said she expects six to eight of those startups to be chosen for Topeka's first accelerator program cohort. And she looks forward to engaging with them to show what Topeka can offer.
   
 "I want to start individual conversations with each of them to understand where there company is at this time, what the most pressing needs are right now, what their future plans are," Bridges said. "I think we need to do a lot of listening to understand exactly where we can add value. This is certainly not going to be a cookie-cutter approach."
   
 Once chosen, the startups will participate in a three-month-long program aimed at helping them get off the ground. Though the program sessions this year will be held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, Topeka in the future will look to welcome startups to the capital city about every six months for in- person sessions.
   
 The local accelerator was designed to capitalize on regional resources and could solidify Topeka's role in the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor, a region of the U.S. anchored by Manhattan, Kan., and Columbia, Mo., where more than 300 animal health-related companies are located.
   
 "As the animal health, agtech and bioscience industries come together, it is the ideal time to create this incredible innovation platform in Topeka," said Saeed Amidi, CEO and founder of Plug and Play. "With our wide grasp of technologies and solutions across different industries, we are very excited to explore and foster the animal health and agtech ecosystem here in Topeka."

The original Vermintide was released five years ago, introducing us to the Ubersreik Five and the joys of killing the mutant rat-people called skaven in large numbers. Developers Fatshark are celebrating the anniversary with an in- game event in its sequel Vermintide 2, which will run until October 26.
 First up, there's the return of A Quiet Drink, the map available during previous anniversary events. It's a pub crawl that leads from the Hungry Troll Tavern to the Obese Megalodon, with bespoke drunken dialogue and hordes of enemies along the way. Finish that or any other mission this week, and you'll get a grotesque free hat themed after the Obese Megalodon pub's mascot. It's a shark's head. A selection of hat bundles are on sale too.
 There's also a kill counter that will track every enemy slain between now and November 1. If it hits 300,000,005 everyone will be rewarded with a weekend of triple XP, and if it breaks 555,555,555 that'll be two triple-XP weekends. It's already at 19,800,062.
 Finally, there's a Twitch stream happening on October 23 at "roughly 4pm CET," they say, where Fatshark's CEO and narrative director will reminisce and "possibly share something new". Maybe some more info about the Chaos Wastes expansion? Or additional DLC careers in the vein of the Grail Knight? We'll have to wait and see.
 Both Vermintide and Vermintide 2 are outstanding co-op shooters: Vermintide 2 placed rather high in our list of every Warhammer Fantasy game, ranked.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry says the state has arrested five people for allegedly stealing unemployment benefits.Three of the five are accused of using someone else’s name and personal information to file on their behalf. Landry says fraudsters have stolen more than $300,000 since the pandemic began in March.It’s not yet clear if the accused will have to pay that money back if convicted.“Since the public health emergency was declared, many of our neighbors fell ill and unfortunately, thousands lost their lives. Others, who never contracted the disease, have also been impacted in numerous negative ways,” said Landry. “Hundreds of businesses were forced to shut down and their employees lost their jobs, leading to thousands of Louisianians filing for unemployment. With record unemployment and record amounts of government benefits being paid out, the fraudsters came crawling.”Landry cited several reasons as catalysts for the fraud, including multiple checks being sent to the same address or bank account, employers getting employment confirmation requests for people who never worked with them, and people filing in multiple states.“While others may have been asleep at the wheel, we are not. We are here, we will find you, and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law possible," said Landry.The state’s labor department says people have tried to gain as much as $300 million out of the system since the pandemic began. Landry says fraudsters have stolen about $300,000, meaning criminals are getting away with .1% of the money they’ve attempted to steal.The arrests come as lawmakers search high and low for money to refill the state’s unemployment savings account. Louisiana has already gone into debt to keep making payments.There is no long-term plan to pay all of the loans back, though a bill that would spend $85 million in savings on the fund is sitting on Gov. John Bel Edwards desk. The legislature halted an automatic tax increase on businesses that would’ve helped replenish the pot.Kayla Giles, 33, of Alexandria, and Teri Thibodeaux, 33, of Forest Hill, were arrested and charged with felony identity theft, felony money laundering, government benefits fraud, and criminal conspiracy. The pair is accused of using approximately 25 stolen identities to file fraudulent COVID-19 related unemployment claims (valued at approximately $300,000) in multiple states. In addition to the identity theft scheme, the two allegedly made fraudulent claims in their own names in multiple states, with Giles receiving approximately $13,000 and Thibodaux receiving $37,000.Kayla Giles, 33Teri Thibodeaux, 33Demarcus Evans, 30, of Bossier City, was arrested Monday, Oct. 19 and charged with felony identity theft and government benefits fraud. He’s accused of using a female acquaintance’s personal information to file fraudulent COVID-19 related unemployment claims. Evans allegedly defrauded the State of Louisiana of approximately $8,600.Demarcus Evans, 30Christina French, 41, of Florida, is a fugitive of Louisiana for an arrest warranted issued Thursday, Oct. 15 pertaining to felony money laundering, government benefits fraud, and computer fraud. She’s accused of hacking the Louisiana Workforce Commission’s (LWC) online account of a Shreveport resident. French allegedly redirected the victim’s benefits to an out-of-state bank account that she controlled and that French transferred approximately $6,000 into that fraudulent account.Christina French, 41Amanda Garner, 33, of Covington, was arrested and charged with government benefits fraud. She’s accused of filing fraudulent COVID-19 related unemployment claim and weekly certifications. Garner allegedly obtained approximately $5,200 in unemployment benefits fraudulently as she did not qualify for unemployment because she remained employed during the COVID-19 shutdown and was not financially impacted.Amanda Garner, 33Landry encourages anyone who knows of someone fraudulently receiving funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund or who believes he or she has been victimized to report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud’s hotline at 866-720-5721 or online here.Click here to report a typo.Copyright 2020 WAFB.

"We can't panic, man. Who said we were going to go 16-0 or 15-1 and win the Super Bowl? You don't have to win every game to win a Super Bowl. You have to win enough to get yourself in the playoffs. ... We're still in a good spot. We're No. 1 in the division and we have another division opponent coming up this weekend. ... We have the players here and we have the answers here. I feel like we're going to be fine."

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KAIT) - After the director denied the Old Country Store’s request for a retail liquor license replacement permit, the Alcoholic Beverage Control gave the store the okay to sell more than just beer and wine.The ABC overturned the director’s Sept. 17 denial decision during their meeting Wednesday.During the meeting, representatives for both Don Nicholas and the opposition to the reversal put their case to the board.Hayden Shugar represented Nicholas during the meeting and said the opposition put forward the same baseless argument on public safety that they have in the past.“You’ve been presented with the same baseless arguments of a public safety interest for denying this permit but we’ve had two witnesses here today that were quite capable of testifying if that was truly an issue,” Shugar said.Those two people, who were on the call for the opposition were Craighead County Judge Marvin Day and Greene County Chief Deputy Shanon Anthony, who was on the call on Sheriff Steve Franks' behalf.Chief Deputy Anthony said the department’s biggest concern is the location of the store and its distance from Paragould.Judge Day argued that the taxpayers of Craighead County could foot the bill when it comes to providing timely public safety assistance to the store.“Basically for me, it’s just the fact there is really not an ability for Greene County to adequately serve the safety interest of that facility, and he is relying on the taxpayers of Craighead County to provide that service in a timely manner,” Day said.In the end, the board voted to reverse the director’s decision to deny the permit, but Nicholas will have to remove the food services from the store and maintain the minimum required alcohol inventory to keep the license.Scott Hardin with the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration said the reason for Director Doralee Chandler’s initial denial was due to opposition expressed by local leaders.He said when there is opposition like that, the application is usually initially denied.He also said an ABC agent must inspect the store to make sure the requirements set out by the board are being met.Copyright 2020 KAIT.
