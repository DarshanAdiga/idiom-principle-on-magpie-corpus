"He just knocked him out," he said. "They knocked them out cold, and he was just walking down the road like nothing had happened, so I put the video out hoping to identify him and asked him why he did that, and he just shrugged at me and looked as if he did nothing. It was heinous."

A retired British shop clerk received the first shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program Tuesday, signaling the start of a global immunization effort intended to offer a route out of a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million.
   
 Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, got the shot at 6:31 a.m. on what public health officials have dubbed “V-Day.” She was first in line at University Hospital Coventry, one of several hospitals around the country that are handling the initial phase of the United Kingdom’s program. As luck would have it, the second injection went to a man named William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old who hails from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born.
   
 … The U.K. is the first Western country to start a mass vaccination program after British regulators last week authorized the use of a COVID-19 shot developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. U.S. and European Union regulators may approve the vaccine in coming days, fueling a global immunization effort.

He failed to haul in a deep pass from Roethlisberger on Pittsburgh's first drive and later dropped a pass in the red zone. Still, he drew a 36-yard pass interference penalty on Baltimore's Marlon Humphrey, something that's happening regularly as opposing defenses try to slow him down.

San Francisco, California.- Apple lanzo este martes al mercado la que sera su ultima novedad de hardware de 2020, unos auriculares de gama alta con cancelacion de sonido bautizados como AirPods Max y su precio sera de USD 549 (en Mexico se venderan a 13,699 pesos), una cifra muy alta que incluso supera la de algunos modelos de iPhone. La multinacional estadounidense explico en un comunicado que los AirPods Max funcionan sin cables, se coordinan facilmente con el iPhone, pueden recibir ordenes de voz y tienen una autonomia de bateria de veinte horas. Pese a venir equipados con tecnologia de cancelacion de sonido, los auriculares incluyen el modo transparente, que permite al usuario oir algunos ruidos externos para que este no se aisle por completo de su entorno si, por ejemplo, se encuentra caminando por la calle, y evitar asi posibles accidentes, y el audio, un audio espacial que permite detectar nuestros movimientos para adaptar los movimientos a estos; es capaz de reproducir sonido en 5.1, 7.1 y Dolby Atmos.  Los nuevos dispositivos de Apple, que usan sus microchips H1 de fabricacion propia, estan disponibles en gris, plateado, azul, verde y rosa, pueden encargarse a traves de la pagina web desde hoy mismo y llegaran a las tiendas el 15 de diciembre, justo a tiempo para la campaña navideña. La caida de los ingresos por telefonos iPhone, que ya se arrastra desde hace varios meses, lastro en octubre los beneficios de Apple para su año fiscal 2020, aunque estos crecieron un 4 % gracias al impulso de los servicios y productos accesorios como los AirPods. La facturacion aumento en todos sus segmentos de negocio (tabletas iPad, ordenadores Mac, servicios y tecnologia ponible y accesorios) salvo en el que sigue siendo el estandarte de la compañia, el telefono iPhone, por el que en los pasados doce meses ingreso menos dinero que en el ejercicio anterior. Aun asi, el iPhone constituye en torno a la mitad del total de ingresos de Apple (137.781 millones este año), seguidos muy de lejos por la que es la gran apuesta de futuro de la compañia, los servicios (53.768 millones) y la categoria Tecnologia ponible, para el hogar y accesorios, que incluye dispositivos como el Apple Watch, el HomePod y los auriculares AirPods (30.620 millones).

Kelly and the House's top Democrat, Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, already had described Coleman as being unfit to serve. Coleman posted tweets immediately after the November election criticizing Kelly, including a later-deleted one that said, "People will realize one day when I call a hit out on you it's real." He said later that he meant to use the phrase "political hit."
 Coleman was charged in May 2015 with a felony count of making a criminal threat against a high school student but later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of harassment. A police arrest report and investigative summary from the incident said Coleman threatened to go to a girl's high school, shoot her and turn the gun on himself.
 In June, he acknowledged in a post on Facebook that allegations of revenge porn and harassing middle school girls online were true but called them the actions of a "sick and troubled 14-year-old boy."
 The state Democratic Party disowned Coleman in August when an ex-girlfriend accused him of being physically abusive to her in late December 2019.
 Sawyer had said Democrats likely would seek to oust Coleman once he was sworn in by forcing a House vote on expelling him. But Sawyer said Tuesday that House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. discouraged such a move because it would involve conduct before Coleman took office.
 Democrats now are likely to monitor the new lawmaker's actions closely, Sawyer said.
 "I have a feeling he's not going to make it the two years, but we'll see," said Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat. "If he can behave for two years, yeah, then, we'll just get a primary."
 Ryckman said he told Sawyer only that overturning an election was a problematic "slippery slope."
 "I cautioned about undoing the will of the voters, who just knew who they voting for," said Ryckman, an Olathe Republican.
 Coleman has argued that the House can't expel him for conduct that occurred before he took office.
 "I'm focusing on governing," he said.

Many advisors– including Schoeder – praised Delta Air Lines for its protocols.
 “Delta is doing a fantastic job with blocking middle seats, limiting capacity, announcing boarding and deplaning rules, and enforcing mask-wearing,” said Sandy Pappas of Sandy Pappas Travel, a Travel Experts affiliate. “I flew Delta [during] Thanksgiving and several gate and ticket agents thanked us for our business.”
 Similarly, Sarah Klein of Time for Travel recently traveled to Los Cabos on Delta. “It was like business class to Europe,” she said. “I was blown away at the level of service and gratitude across the board. I will go out of my way to recommend Delta going forward.”
 Klein also had high praise for Southwest’s protocols. “I have flown Southwest a number of times, and as usual they did a great job – they’ve even taken it a step further with enhanced customer service and overall keeping a positive, upbeat experience.”
 On the destination front, many agents extolled protocols in Mexico and Jamaica.
 “I visited 12 resorts in Los Cabos in late October/November. All were doing a fantastic job with COVID protocols – taking temperatures upon arrival to the resort, taking temperatures as you enter resort restaurants, hand sanitizer stations throughout and signage stating masks required,” Pappas said.
 “Every resort had masks for guests who didn’t have them. Pool and beach staff kept chairs social distanced and didn’t allow guests to move the chairs at the Montage Cabo. Four Seasons as a brand is doing a great job with the program they’ve coordinated with Johns Hopkins.”
 Jamaica also received accolades. “I was in Jamaica just before Thanksgiving and felt very safe knowing that everyone on my plane had been tested, and thought overall they did a good job with the health screenings,” Klein said.
 Several agents were extremely impressed with the job Playa Hotels & Resorts’ Hyatt resort brand was doing on the health and safety front.
 My initial [post-pandemic travel] experience was Cancun at the Hyatt Ziva and Zilara, and they did an incredible job,” said Tom Brussow of Sunsational Beach Vacations. “Every base was covered [yet] they still ensured that it felt like you were on vacation.
 Domestically, Schoeder pointed to two properties with excellent sanitization protocols: the Venetian Las Vegas and Waldorf Beverly Hills.
 At the Venetian, guests are provided with welcome packs in rooms with masks, hand sanitizer and anti-bacterial wipes, she said.
 Common guestroom items that are hard to sanitize, such as magazines, were removed. “Breakfast was grab and go from several different dining options – so no lines,” Schoeder said. “Masks were enforced.”
 At the Waldorf Beverly Hills, guestrooms are left vacant for 48 hours.
 “Once the client is gone, removers take all linens out, and then use electrostatic spray to kill germs,” she said.
 “The next step is housekeepers clean everything with environmentally friendly sanitizing spray – getting all the touch points. Linens are plastic wrapped and only opened in the rooms to lessen the chance of any exposure to germs.”
 The piece de resistance?
 “Kennedy comes in. Kennedy is a pulse, high-intensity UV disinfecting robot most commonly used in hospitals. It zaps the entire room before guest arrival and then the room is sealed until the guest arrives.”
 In the final analysis, until the pandemic ebbs and a vaccine becomes available to a large swath of the population, agents are doing their best to keep their clients safe with judicious booking options.
 “Cleanliness is the top concern right now for many,” Schoeder said.
