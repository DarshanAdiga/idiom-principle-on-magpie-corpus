Still, awareness of the availability and effectiveness of values-based investing in general has a long way to go. As protesters take to the streets to topple systems that, in their view, have supported socially unjust practices, many of them unknowingly continue to financially empower those very systems by way of their investment accounts. Private (but publicly traded) prison companies, for example, rely financially on putting and keeping people in prison. It’s clearly counter-intuitive to protest social injustice or donate to criminal justice reformers while you’re financially supporting the private prison industry in your 401k. And yet millions of people across the country unknowingly carry out some form of this unfortunate irony every day and with every invested dollar.

To clean those surfaces use warm water, soap and a microfiber cloth to remove dust, dirt and grime particles. Rinse with clean water after washing to remove soap residue, which could attract dust.


  Be careful when using soap and water near electrical equipment, such as touchscreen monitors. Electrical equipment is sensitive to moisture, especially along monitor edges. Alcohol wipes may be a better option for some screens. Touchscreen monitors should not be disinfected with ammonia-based disinfectants because ammonia can damage the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings. Refer to a tractor or vehicle owner's manual for proper cleaning procedures for electrical units and touchscreen monitors.


  Once the dirt, dust and grime is removed, use a household disinfectant to kill bacteria and viruses on the surfaces. Do not use bleach or hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectants in tractors and vehicle interiors because they can damage upholstery.


  We recommend producers encourage everyone on the farm to wash his or her hands, and use hand sanitizers when washing is not an option. Stock the farm shop's wash station with soap and disposable towels, and provide hand sanitizer for employees to carry. Also clean workspaces often, and supply a garbage bag to throw away contaminated materials such as gloves or wipes that workers can remove easily at the end of each shift or task.


  In addition create a cleaning and sanitizing record sheet. Producers and employees can record the date, time, equipment or tools and how they cleaned or sanitized the items. Keep that paper record in a binder in a high-traffic area in the shop.


  Placing stickers inside equipment to remind operators to wipe the steering wheel, key-ignition switch, gear shift, door handles, radio and climate- control knobs before exiting the equipment also can be helpful.

Slip of the tongue after play-off final success
   *[FT]: Financial Times

Facebook has a long tradition of cloning competitive services. The Instagram “Story” feature, which lets people share photos and videos that expire in 24 hours, is similar to Snapchat. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced tough questioning about the company’s habit of copying rivals before a congressional hearing on July 29.


  Facebook earlier launched a TikTok knockoff called Lasso in 2018, but closed that down in July. It also tried services similar to Snapchat called Slingshot and Poke before Instagram Stories caught on. But those were separate apps — it might have more success with a feature built into Instagram.


  In fact, copying Snapchat’s features was successful for Instagram in part because Snapchat was difficult to figure out for new users. They were already comfortable with Instagram. But TikTok is very easy to use \-- easier than Instagram -- and part of its appeal is that you’re able to sit back and scroll endlessly with just swipes, without the need to follow anyone or post anything.


  For Reels to succeed, Facebook will have to lure video creators away from TikTok. This might be easier to do with Reels since many creators are already on Instagram. In response to published reports that Instagram is paying TikTok influencers to join Reels, Instagram said in a statement that the company “have a long history of reaching out to emerging creators and working to break new stars on Instagram.”


  “As with previous products, we remain committed to investing in both our creators and their overall experience, and in certain cases, we may help cover production costs for their creative ideas,” the company said.


  TikTok, in turn, launched a $200 million “creator fund” in July that it says will grow to over $1 billion in the U.S. in the next three years and more than double that globally, to pay video creators for their material.


  TikTok, however, is under fire, possibly opening an opportunity for Facebook.


  Microsoft is in talks to buy part of TikTok in what would be a forced sale, following threats from President Donald Trump to ban the Chinese-owned video app, which claims 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.


  Since early July, TikTok users have been posting videos urging viewers to follow them to other platforms like Instagram, reflecting the threat of a TikTok ban. Mary Keane-Dawson, Group CEO at influencer marketing agency Takumi, said the influencers she works with have been sad, angry and upset about the threat of a ban. Still, they’re “pragmatic,” she said, and the smart ones were already active on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.


  Reels is debuting in over 50 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Australia and others, as well as officially launching in the test countries — Brazil, France, Germany and India.


  Instagram has more than a billion users worldwide. TikTok says it has 100 million users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally.

People will need a small yellow card at airports to show immunization against the COVID-19 virus. Schools, restaurants and sports stadiums will be equipped with quick, inexpensive testing stations for students and customers.


   


  The world will be fighting coronavirus for the next three to four years as virus hot spots skip from nation to nation, and the pandemic's toll will linger for decades, said Dr. Larry Brilliant, a California epidemiologist who was part of a World Health Organization team in the 1970s that helped eradicate smallpox.


   


  But it's "not all doom and gloom," with effective vaccines likely to emerge from dozens of candidates worldwide and effective treatments, including convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies, to help people recover more quickly, said Brilliant, who chairs Ending Pandemics advisory board.


   


  "We will still be chasing the virus four years from now. But it won't be like (today)," Brilliant told the USA TODAY Editorial Board on Monday afternoon. "It will be like the smallpox eradication program. The polio eradication program. Having yellow fever in some countries and not in others."


   


  Still, before vaccine trials weed out contenders from pretenders, the U.S. likely faces a substantial increase in cases and deaths. As of Monday, the nation had 4.7 million cases and 155,165 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.


   


  The immediate challenges are Labor Day get-togethers, the return of schools, flu season in the the fall and winter and long election lines in November, said Brilliant, who was an adviser for the 2011 film "Contagion" and team doctor for the rock band the Grateful Dead.


   


  Schools are fraught with transmission risks, he said, from bus rides to indoor crowds that can hasten spread - cafeterias, gyms, locker rooms, theaters and indoor swimming pools. And schools often spark respiratory disease and influenza season with infected children bringing viruses home. This will allow COVID-19 to grow and spread to areas where it's caused little disruption so far.


   


  "We're in for a bad and rocky ride," Brilliant said.


   


  He said the virus will continue to spread until something stops its growth, possibly the combination of effective vaccines with annual boosters and immunity among those who've developed antibodies to halt or limit future infections.


   


  A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine estimated COVID-19 cases ranged from six to 24 times higher than official counts. The large federal study relied on antibody testing data in 10 cities to gauge whether individuals previously were infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibody tests are different than diagnostic tests, which detect whether someone is currently infected.


   


  Brilliant said that if about 10% of U.S. residents have been infected so far, there's a long road ahead until the population reaches herd immunity and new transmissions burn out. By his estimate, there are "300 million more customers for this disease who have not bought it yet."


   


  The best way to halt the virus' march to herd immunity is for 50 states to adopt a uniform approach of masks, social distancing, hand-washing and limiting crowded indoor places such as bars and restaurants.


   


  He said combining those actions in a coordinated way would be as effective without the need for a total shutdown, which would create "political and emotional and economic hell if we close everything down in the same way we did before."


   


  He wants the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take a stronger role in urging coordinate action to slow the virus. In the absence of federal leadership, governors could coordinate and act.


   


  Brilliant said federal health officials have navigated past outbreaks of Ebola, Zika and the swine flu pandemic in 2009-2010, which caused far fewer deaths than COVID-19.

Matthew Stafford does not have COVID-19.


   


  The Detroit Lions took their starting quarterback off the reserve/COVID-19 list Tuesday, saying he was the victim of a "false positive" test.


   


  "Today we removed Matthew Stafford from the COVID-IR list and onto the Active Roster," the Lions said in a statement. "As a result of a False-Positive test result, he was forced due to NFL/NFLPA protocols to sit out until he received two negative tests."


   


  Stafford tested negative for COVID-19 in his first two tests upon reporting to training camp last week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Lions said in their statement.


   


  After testing positive Friday, Stafford had three consecutive negative tests, the Lions said.


   


  "To be clear, Matthew does NOT have COVID-19 and never has had COVID-19 and the test in question was a False-Positive," the Lions said. "Also, all of Matthew's family have been tested and everyone is negative."


   


  False positive tests have been a concern of teams and players, and with no easy answer on how to solve the issue.


   


  Had Stafford's positive test appeared in season, he likely would have had to miss a regular season game.


   


  "It's one of those things that are going to be questionable for sure," Lions linebacker Jarrad Davis said. "But at the end of the day we knew coming into this that there were going to be situations like this and just knowing that we've got to hope the NFL and NFLPA can continue to work at it to knock things out, knock situations out that are going to come up like this. Because, yeah, this might be the first one that we've heard about but I'm sure there's more that are going to happen. Hopefully they come up with a better way or continue to work on the way that we're doing it to test everybody and I'm confident that everything will work out."


   


  The Lions have placed eight players on the COVID-19 list in their first week of camp.


   


  And along with Stafford, the team removed cornerback Justin Coleman from the list, too. Coleman was asymptomatic when he tested positive.


   


  On Monday, they removed tight end Isaac Nauta from the list after a five-day stay.


   


  Players who test positive for the novel coronavirus but are asymptomatic can return per NFL guidelines once five days have passed from their initial positive test so long as they post consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.


   


  Symptomatic players who test positive for COVID-19 can return as soon as 10 days after their symptoms first appeared, provided their return is cleared by team doctors.


   


  Wide receiver Kenny Golladay, tight end T.J. Hockenson, cornerback Amani Oruwariye, safety Jalen Elliott and punter Arryn Siposs remain on the reserve/COVID-19 list.

South Effingham graduate Chloe Strickland already had plans for her freshman year of college. Then Brewton-Parker College added something to sweeten her post high school experience -- a chance to play softball.


   


  Now Strickland's packing for Mount Vernon after signing a letter of intent July 30 to play with the Barons.


   


  "Coach (Madison) Herrin saw me at a travel softball tournament and asked me if I was interested in coming to Brewton-Parker," said Strickland, who originally considered attending Georgia Southern. "At first, I didn't know, but I liked the campus and thought about it a little more. I'm excited about it now."


   


  Strickland joins an NAIA program that appears headed in the right direction. Brewton-Parker, which plays in the Southern States Athletic Conference, was 8-6 in the spring before the season ended because of COVID-19 concerns.


   


  The Barons had a 16-35 record in 2019 and 9-41 in 2018.


   


  Strickland, a third baseman, hit .244 in her first season as a starter at SEHS a year ago. She was a member of the Mustangs' 2018 squad that advanced to the Class 5A Elite Eight in Columbus and finished fifth.


   


  "At South Effingham, I always had to work hard to prove I was worthy of playing time," Strickland said. "That taught me working for everything is rewarding."


   


  Strickland said she plans on majoring in business management at Brewton- Parker.


   


  Bradwell, Liberty Co. suspend fall sports


   


  Effingham County and South Effingham recently plugged holes in their football schedules but like a worn inner tube a few more holes seemingly sprang out of nowhere.


   


  On July 31, the Liberty County school system announced on its website that its schools would suspend fall sports until further notice because of concerns of COVID-19.


   


  The announcement read: "After careful review of COVID-19 trends in and around the surrounding areas in the state of Georgia, we have determined that it is no longer feasibly safe to continue fall athletic activities. As a result, all Liberty County system fall sports and extra-curricular activities are suspended until further notice.


   


  Bradwell Institute, in Liberty County, competes in Region 2-6A where Effingham County and South Effingham reside. ECHS had a non-region home game scheduled with Liberty County on Sept. 18 and region home game scheduled with Bradwell on Nov. 6.


   


  "These are tough times and everybody is checking schedules all over, but it's tough to fill exact dates," Rebels coach Buddy Holder said.


   


  SEHS, which moved into the region this year, was slated to travel to Bradwell on Nov. 20.


   


  It wasn't the first time SEHS and ECHS had 2020 opponents drop out. South Carolina high schools whittled their football schedules to seven games and the Mustangs and Rebels had to replace lost games with Beaufort, S.C.


   


  SEHS added Windsor Forest, and ECHS added Benedictine.


   


  The Liberty County school system's decision also negates softball and volleyball games and takes its cross country runners out of regular-season and post-season competitions.
