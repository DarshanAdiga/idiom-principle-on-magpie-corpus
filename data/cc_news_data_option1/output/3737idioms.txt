PORTLAND -- Each year, volunteers from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network take to Washington to call on members of Congress to support increased cancer research funding.
   
 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year's lobbying had to take place over the phone -- but that didn't stop over 700 people from across the country from lobbying members of Congress Tuesday.
   
 Among those participating in the calls was Beth Trierweiler, a native of Portland in Ionia County. Trierweiler was in contact with a legislative assistant of Rep. Justin Amash, L-Cascade, urging the Congressman to support legislation to boost research funding.
   
 Trierweiler herself is a survivor of cancer, and has been participating in the CAS' day of lobbying since 2012. She said it's imperative that Congress includes provisions to keep those currently battling cancer safe during the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "Of course, we want (Congress) to work on getting the next COVID package moved forward to put those protections in place for people that are currently going through cancer and their families and caregivers," Trierweiler said. "That's very important.
   
 "Cancer didn't stop because of COVID. So what's most important is that we make sure that cancer patients can get those treatments that they need and move forward with their cancer journey."
   
 All 14 House representatives from Michigan were contacted Tuesday. Trierweiler said CAS advocates have good relationships with Congressional members, but will continue to call on them to support cancer research legislation, like the Henrietta Lacks Enhancing Cancer Research Act.
   
 The bill would require the federal government to examine how barriers, such as access to transportation, impact the treatment of cancer.
   
 Amash is not seeking re-election this November, and will be replaced by either Democratic candidate Hillary Scholten or Republican candidate Peter Meijer.
   
 Trierweiler said she's prepared to advocate to either candidate.
   
 "I haven't worked with anyone else in my congressional unit in the house since I started, because Rep. Amash has been in that seat since I started," she said. "I think we're super excited to get in there from ground zero from the beginning of this person's term to introduce ourselves and bring important cancer issues to the forefront."

EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — The leaves are starting to change color around the NHL playoff bubble, and, at most, seven games remain before the Stanley Cup is handed out.
 On Saturday night, two of the league's southernmost teams begin a Stanley Cup Final like none other in the great white north when the Dallas Stars and Tampa Bay Lightning face off in Game 1. The Texas and Florida heat that would have been around in late May and June has been replaced by a chill in the air with teams from nontraditional markets vying for hockey's biggest prize in the northernmost city in the NHL.
 "We don't know what the temperature is outside because we're never outside, so it doesn't come into play," Stars general manager Jim Nill said from the confines of the bubble. "We're 75, 80 degrees here all the time, so it's perfect — perfect environment."

Less than a month after his sudden announcement that he would step down due to health reasons, Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, 65, has passed on the baton to his long-term associate, Yoshihide Suga, 71. Mr. Suga promises continuity rather than change as he takes the reins. His choice is itself an indicator of that continuity: he has been Chief Cabinet Secretary since 2012, as well as the top spokesperson and a key implementer of Mr. Abe’s policies. An elected MP since 1996, Mr. Suga was Minister of State for Internal Affairs and Communications during Mr. Abe’s previous tenure in 2006-07. In his press conference after winning the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party this week, Mr. Suga said his goal is to continue with Mr. Abe’s policies and complete his goals, particularly the tasks of reviving the economy and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. He has also retained Mr. Abe’s key cabinet choices which include the Finance, Foreign and Environment Ministers. Despite his best intentions to stay the course, he has taken charge at a crucial moment in a rapidly changing world and will need to steer through the outcome of the U.S. elections in November, China’s growing aggressiveness, and a worldwide economic downturn. A main challenge will be to ensure the success of the Tokyo Olympics, now rescheduled for July 2021 due to the pandemic.
 For India, Mr. Abe’s exit is a loss, given his game-changing moves on India- Japan ties, which included upgrading the relationship to a Special Strategic and Global Partnership, instituting the annual Prime Ministerial summits from 2006, spearheading both versions of the Quadrilateral with the U.S. and Australia, and personally moving the India-Japan civil nuclear partnership through the Diet (parliament), Japan’s first with a non-NPT country. One of his last meetings as Prime Minister was a telephonic summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announcing the signing of the Acquisition and Cross- Servicing Agreement, a significant step in defence cooperation. His close personal relationship with Mr. Modi, both seen as “strongmen” leaders, built on his earlier partnership with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom he shared his famous “three arrows” economic strategy called ‘Abenomics’. Mr. Suga would be well aware of the big shoes he must fill and the importance of the relationship with India for Japan. It is significant that one of the new government’s first engagements is likely to be the Foreign Minister-level meeting of the Quad countries in Tokyo next month, which will also give New Delhi insight into how much has changed and how much will stay the same in Japan’s view of the world with the change at the helm.

Event coordinator Michael Humphrey said the people shouting “fascist,” “racists” and “screw you” out of their windows were merely contributing to the growing polarization in America.
 “They don’t want to listen to [the] other side, talk or have a dialogue about it,” Humphrey said.
 According to Humphrey the police budget decreased at the beginning of this year, and he — along with the rest of the crowd — didn’t want to see any further budget reduction. In approving the town budget earlier this year, the Town Council cut department budgets across the board in anticipation of lost revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 While the voices supporting funds for the police seemed mixed with those voicing support for President Donald Trump’s reelection, attendee Robert Wachter explained the connection.
 “If you’re a Trump supporter, you are also a police supporter,” he said. “You’re a law-and-order individual.”
 Disheartened by the resignation of Lt. Roger Schultz in August, after Schultz made what many believed was an inappropriate joke on social media regarding police responding to a reported statutory rape, Wachter said taking funds away from the police would bring Americans one step closer to anarchy.
 “I wish [policemen] didn’t have to be armed but, unfortunately, there are a lot of criminals out there that dictate that they are armed,” Wachter said.
 Unlike Wachter, who directly correlates support for President Trump with police support, Suzy Dawson came to share her message that mistakes people make need forgiveness, not harsh punishments.
 “We’re dehumanizing each other,” Dawson said of Schultz’s situation. “There’s nobody that’s perfect, and so, for me, this is about this officer who was wrongly forced out of a situation.”

ALFRED, Maine -- County officials had spoken with a sense of cautious optimism this past week about the trajectory of a major coronavirus outbreak at York County Jail, saying they could reopen the intake area to new inmates as soon as next weekend.
   
 But that timeline is again up in the air now that the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has linked a new case to the jail outbreak, according to York County Manager Greg Zinser. Maine CDC notified county officials Thursday night that the latest positive, a vendor with ties to the jail, is being considered part of an outbreak at the jail building, Zinser said Friday.
   
 Sheriff Bill King and Zinser told the York County commissioners Wednesday about the vendor's positive test. King and Zinser said public health officials were still working at that time to determine if the virus was contracted at the jail or elsewhere.
   
 This latest determination by Maine CDC means the state's outbreak investigation at jail will remain open until at least mid-October, Zinser said.
   
 "We are discussing how this affects our resumption of new intakes and have no further information as we need to discuss this with the CDC," he said.
   
 For the past two weeks, the jail has been diverting all new arrestees to Cumberland County.
   
 Maine CDC closes its outbreak investigations when four weeks have passed without a new case, spokesperson Robert Long said. That 28-day timeframe is based on two 14-day incubation periods, he said.
   
 The CDC identified a total of 86 cases linked to the York County Jail, as of Thursday. That includes 48 inmates, 19 people who work in the building that houses the jail and 19 household members of people who work in the building, Long said.
   
 Of the 19 workers who have tested positive, 17 are correction officers and two are other York County government employees, Zinser said.
   
 The jail outbreak is part of a broader series of interconnected outbreaks Maine CDC has tied to an Aug. 7 wedding and reception in the Millinocket area. The business that hosted the reception, Big Moose Inn, lost its license briefly over violations of the state's pandemic-related occupancy rules.
   
 The broader wedding-related outbreak includes Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center in Madison and the Calvary Baptist Church in Sanford, Maine CDC Director Nirav Shah said Thursday. A total of 177 coronavirus cases and seven deaths had been associated with the wedding events and subsequent related outbreaks, Shah said Thursday.
   
 None of the deaths have been linked to York County Jail. Zinser has said only a few inmates and staffers have showed any symptoms, and no one at the jail has required hospitalization.
   
 Long declined to comment on any individual case of COVID-19, citing patient privacy laws.

 Strength in our lower bodies is not only good for us but is a necessity for everyday life. In addition to walking, we sit and stand, bend and squat, lean and lunge, and everything else in between. All of those motions require leg strength, and to attain that, variety is key.
 Our move today is a step back lunge. This exercise will be working your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. All you need is a smooth surface for lunging.
 To begin this exercise, start by standing tall with your feet placed about hip-width. Holding your chest up, and engaging your abdominals for added balance, step back with your right foot.
 Keeping the weight on the ball of your foot; proceed to sit into the extended leg by bending in that knee. Your front knee will be bending as well but be mindful to keep the positioning behind the front foot.
 Continue to bend and sit into this step back lunge as low as you are comfortable doing then proceed to push back up to your starting position. Stand tall, with both feet returned to level ground. Then repeat the same movement on the left side.
 Keeping your hands positioned just on your hips, shoot for at least eight to 10 lunges on each side for three sets each.
 If you need intensity, you can hold a set of hand weights in each hand. And if you need a little help with balance, you can hold a broomstick just in front of you.
 If you have issues with knee pain, you can keep the lunge shallow. Just be mindful to engage the muscles you are focusing on.
 This step back lunge is great added into any lower body routine, and is also a great move to help with balance and stability.

Novak Djokovic said he was "pushed to the limit" by fellow Serbian Filip Krajinovic before booking a quarter-final place at the Internazionali d'Italia in Rome.
 The world number one advanced to the last eight for a 14th straight year at the tournament with a 7-6 (9-7) 6-3 victory over Krajinovic.
 Djokovic had not faced Krajinovic in more than a decade and said it was difficult facing off against one of his closest friends.
 "It was one of the longest sets of my career," he said of the first set which lasted an hour and 27 minutes. "It is never easy to play against one of your best friends of so many years.
 "We have only played 10 years ago in Serbia and he has changed as a person and as a player. It is rare that we have not played against each other in this decade. We trained several times together and we have played the Davis Cup together; it was good to play against him.
 "Janko Tipsarevic [Krajinovic's coach], a Serbian tennis legend, is doing a great job with him. He's in the top 30; I know he's in shape.
 "I did not start the game as I wanted. I made many unforced errors, but we must congratulate him for pushing me to the limit."
 Djokovic saved five of six break points to seal the win after two hours and seven minutes, setting up a quarter-final clash with Dominik Koepfer.
 He attacked Krajinovic's forehand with gusto and delivered a string of drop shots throughout the first set, but that game plan did not come off when holding two set points at 5-4 on his opponent's serve.
 Krajinovic then started the tie-break strongly, storming into a 4-1 lead, before Djokovic powered back and took advantage of an error from his opponent to seal the set at the fifth time of asking.
 Djokovic wasted little time moving through the gears at the start of the second set, driving forehands down the line to break serve at 1-1. He maintained his advantage to reach 5-3 before breaking serve again to seal the win.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. is one of the first places in the world to use a mouth rinse gargle test for the new coronavirus.
 "Unlike the [nasal] swab, this is a new saline gargle where you put a little bit of saline water, that is sterile water, in your mouth, you swish it around and spit it into a little tube," she said at a news conference Thursday.
 "This test is kind of cool and something we've had in the works for a while. This new method is more comfortable, particularly for our younger children."
 It is developed by a B.C. company, which reduces the province's dependency on the global supply chain, she said.
 Henry described the test as more efficient, which shortens the long lineups and wait times.

But even orbital data can’t tell us the whole story. To fully get a handle on what’s happening at Venus, we have to actually get into the atmosphere. And that’s where aerial platforms come in. Capable of operating above much of the acidic cloud layer – where the temperature and pressure are almost Earthlike – for potentially months at a time, balloons or flying wings could take detailed atmospheric composition measurements there. These craft could even carry the kinds of instruments being developed to look for life on Europa. At that point, humanity might finally be able to definitively tell if we share our Solar System with Venusian life.

_We are concerned by indications that Attorney General Barr might depart from longstanding DOJ principles to take public action related to U.S. Attorney Durham’s investigation that could impact the presidential election. Under longstanding DOJ policy, the Attorney General is expected to refrain from commenting on an ongoing investigation. Attorney General Barr and U.S. Attorney Durham have made several public comments that could violate this Department policy and related guidelines.[1]Attorney General Barr has signaled repeatedly that he is likely to allow DOJ to take prosecutorial actions, make public disclosures, and even issue reports before the presidential election in November.Such actions clearly appear intended to benefit President Trump politically.Specifically, Attorney General Barr has indicated that he would consider taking such steps in the Durham investigation—including the issuance of a report or other summary—within 60 days of the upcoming election. These concerns are even more pressing in light of the resignation of Assistant U.S. Attorney Nora Dannehy, who reportedly resigned due to political pressure from Attorney General Barr on the investigative team to produce a report before the election.[2]_

For decades after the end of World War II, the Holocaust conjured up horrifying images and memories. Names like Auschwitz and Dachau were stinging reminders of a genocide that sought to eliminate the Jewish population in Europe. “Never again,” was both a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust and an admonition to never again allow such hatred to take root.

“We really did feel that there would be an opportunity to have a glide path,” Gordon said, “and a transition that wouldn’t have the precipitous cliff at the end of it.”
 Gordon brought a light touch to the first legislative session of his tenure, which began within a month of his inauguration. He pushed limited initiatives as Senate and House leadership fought another battle in a long-running war over education funding.
 Coal bankruptcies dominated the following summer’s headlines — first Wyoming staple Cloud Peak Energy and then the dramatic collapse of Appalachian-based newcomer Blackjewel.
 For his second session, Gordon doubled down on coal. He gave a rousing speech on the topic to open the Legislature, and his administration pushed a number of measures for coal research and carbon capture. Lawmakers took up the call and passed a slew of coal-boosting bills.
 But by the session’s final week, the bottom was falling out. Caught up in the finale of a packed month of lawmaking, the Legislature did not act on ever- worsening pandemic news or an oil price war breaking out between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
 Days after lawmakers left Cheyenne, Gordon began issuing orders closing schools and many businesses. The state and national economy lurched to a halt.
 In May, the economists that write the state’s revenue projections met for their first emergency meeting since 2009. Surveying shattered oil markets and global financial instability, the economists wrote the state’s revenues down by a range of $1.8 billion to $1 billion.
 Just like that, the two-year budget lawmakers had just passed was untenable. The crisis was at hand.
 “I had no idea that it would become so imminent so quickly,” Gordon said.
 Analysts say an economic slowdown and subsequent deceleration of electricity demand likely accelerated coal’s decline and made a reversal all the more unlikely. Meanwhile, Wyoming’s increased reliance on the oil industry for tax revenue ensured the price war pummeled state coffers.
 But if a virus that emerged in Asia and an international oil price war were the sparks, but the fuel for today’s conflagration had been stacked for years at home. Decades of inaction on the state’s energy dependence by past leaders suddenly mattered.
 Is Gordon frustrated to have inherited an old problem at just the wrong time?
 “I don’t really know how to respond to that,” he said. “Do I rue that? Yeah. But it’s also … it feels good to have to make really monumental decisions. And I think some of these really are. You’re talking about the health of the population of the state of Wyoming and health both in terms of real health and economic health.”
 Gordon tries to balance the urgent demands of the moment with contemplation of Wyoming’s eventual future, he said. In recent press conferences he has talked often about opportunities the pandemic might provide — people are seeking open space, low populations and safety. Many see it here, Gordon says, and there is some very early evidence backing that idea.
 “Keeping people thinking about the future, thinking about … the opportunities that Wyoming provides, having to do that sort of makes it worthwhile getting up in the morning,” Gordon said.
 People who work for or with Gordon describe a cautious decision maker who seeks consensus before taking any leaps.
 “He’s a very classic Wyoming type in that he’s a moseyer,” Rep. Sara Burlingame (D-Cheyenne), said. “He doesn’t gallop, he moseys.
 But in Wyoming’s current political climate, full consensus is unattainable, she said. That’s particularly true when it comes to right-wing activists and politicians who have often rejected and denounced him, she said.
 In April, when Gordon came down the Capitol steps to pray with protesters demanding an end to health orders, his attempts to explain his reasoning were shouted down. One of the protesters referred to him as a secret Democrat.
 “He believes that, ‘if I can just talk to you and look you in the eyes that I can bring you around by the force of my goodwill,’” Burlingame said. It’s a “misplaced belief” that “if we just sit down at the table long enough, take enough calls, … we’ll reach consensus,” she said. “I just think that’s inaccurate.”
 Before the pandemic, Gordon made strides with the hardline conservatives who today run the Wyoming Republican Party.
 A government transparency task force, a bold set of vetoes on his first budget bill and his signing of legislation limiting abortion had all earned Gordon praise from state GOP leadership and conservative lawmakers.
 Right-wing stalwarts like Clem, however, think the virus response may hurt Gordon with the Republican voters he needs to win another primary election.
 Voters resent the public health measures, Clem argues. “I think there’s a growing gulf between main street public Wyoming and the media and government,” he said. “They’re going two different directions.”
 Much of the state party’s messaging also suggests that health orders are overblown and intrusive. A recent post on the party’s Facebook page was flagged by fact checkers as misinformation. It’s unclear if the label diminished its influence.
 The cuts he’s made will impact public safety and Wyoming’s most vulnerable residents, Gordon said.
 He’s discussed the outrage he’s received from some residents over closing some highway rest areas — a cut that barely scratched the surface, Gordon says. However, cuts to government services may not hurt him with many Republican voters who believe state budgets are inflated.
 The other side of the budget equation, raising new revenue through tax increases, for example, are far riskier.
 At his Aug. 26 press conference, Gordon was asked again by reporters if he would push the Legislature to take up taxes. (The question has become a staple of the governor’s press briefings.)
 A day earlier, the Joint Revenue Committee had rejected bills to remove sales tax exemptions and add an additional 1% to the sales tax. Gordon has asked lawmakers to examine the state’s sales tax exemptions on a wide variety of business and personal services. Such an action, taken alone, could add $140 million to coffers over two years.
 “I don’t think it’s a big surprise that they didn’t take any actions,” Gordon said. “Part of it comes back to me, to indicate that ‘sure, we can spend [savings] down over the next two years … then what?’”
 Democrats like Schwartz and others want more. The governor knows what needs to be done, and should use his platform to push the Legislature for tax reforms, they say.
 “He’s the only person who can stand up in a situation like this and say, ‘I hate taxes too but if we don’t do this we’re gonna be in worse trouble,’” Schwartz said.
 “But I’m a Democrat so that’s easy for me to say,” he added with a chuckle. “He will probably want a second term,” Schwartz said. “And he doesn’t have to worry about someone running to the left of him in a Republican primary. The threat to him … is the strength of the extreme right.”
 Gordon might have inherited big problems, but Schwartz doesn’t let him off the hook so easily. Picking up past governors’ fixation on a carbon capture solution for coal is a harmful crutch, he said: “We spent $25 million on carbon research in [the 2020] budget. We’re throwing this money in a raffle and we’re kicking the can down the road.”
 “Mark is part of that school of thought,” he continued. “It’s a Wyoming school of thought that if we can find a way to burn coal with less carbon Wyoming is saved.”
 Picard, the political strategist, does not think Gordon should launch a campaign for tax reform. The governor is constitutionally required to deliver a balanced budget, he said. Long lasting fiscal reform will require legislative buy-in and cooperation. “There’s a team effort here that we’ve gotta get serious about,” Picard said.
 Gordon himself often cites the limits of his office when discussing how to address the fiscal crisis.
 “One of the great things about being governor is you really don’t have … that much power,” he told WyoFile. “You’re given the revenues you have and you have the budget you do.”
 At several points in his political career, Gordon has taken stands on the separation of powers. As treasurer, he sued legislative leadership and the other statewide elected officials over a constitutional dispute. His budget vetoes have also cited constitutional grounds.
 “He has been consistent in that regard,” Clem said.
 However, nowhere in the Wyoming Constitution does it say a governor can’t drive the Legislature in the direction he or she thinks the state should go.
 “If we need anything in Wyoming right now it’s leadership,” Clem said. “… If the Legislature isn’t giving a clear signal about where we’re going, and the governor isn’t, then who is?”
 Gordon has made cuts, and has told the public they will have dire impacts on the state’s most vulnerable residents. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle question if that’s a strategy to force the Legislature’s hand on taxes. Gordon has refuted that suggestion and said the size of the deficit leaves him no choice.
 To critics, that can seem a cop-out by the state’s most powerful leader, and not one reflective of the loftier ideals oft-voiced by the governor. But Burlingame doesn’t think Gordon wants to just “hold on” through this bust either.
 “Mark Gordon is a good man and I don’t think he wants to punt,” Burlingame said. “I think he would feel that is a failure of his stewardship.”
