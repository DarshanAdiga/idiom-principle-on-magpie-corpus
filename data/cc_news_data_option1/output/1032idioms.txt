"But you did realise he was an escapee and could have told the police but for whatever reason chose not to.


  "You are a mum to an 11-year-old child and if I send you to custody that child would be taken into foster care."


  In 2014 Harvey was jailed for 12 years at Leicester Crown Court for committing a robbery at a property in Narborough Road, Rowley Fields, Leicester.


  He and two accomplices burst into the house armed with metal bars while the couple inside were asleep.


  They then punched the victims to the face and stole £3,500 of jewellery from them.


  Mark Achurch, prosecuting, said Harvey had been transferred to HMP Sudbury with a view to him being released halfway through his sentence when he absconded on August 31 last year.

 On its website, OpenTable _shared strategies_ that restaurants could use to cope with downturns in business: reaching out to guests directly, preparing staff and encouraging diners to reschedule rather than cancel.
 The company also recommended ways consumers could support local restaurants without necessarily dining out, including ordering delivery or takeout, purchasing gift certificates or booking prepaid reservations far in advance.

During a news conference on Friday, President Trump showed us just how difficult it is to follow the recommended steps to help curb the spread of coronavirus.
 Appearing at the White House Rose Garden with members of his coronavirus task force as well as the chief executives of several major corporations, the president declared a state of emergency over the pandemic. But, far from practicing any social distancing, those assembled at the podium stood close together, shook hands and freely touched objects that had been handled by others.
 Because the virus is thought to be mainly spread via person-to-person contact, health officials have emphasized the importance of simple, everyday steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. This includes thoroughly washing your hands, staying six feet away from others and not touching your face.
 As seen during the news conference (and the video above), much of this is easier said than done.

  Driver, 47, of Great Thornton Street, befriended the 80-year-old man at Castle Hill Hospital.


  When the laptop was returned, a nurse who knew of Driver's status as a sex offender asked to see its search history and saw what he had been up to. He was sentenced to a two-year community order, and was ordered to register as a sex offender for five years.

This triggered yet another shift in perception — he was now viewed as a career bottom-six player, despite being only 23 years old. His strong work ethic and versatility earned him the trust of then-coach Dave Hakstol heading into the 2018-19 season.

For passengers flying the national carrier Air India, the differences it highlights against the competition are more baggage allowance and legroom and a complete meal experience. And on Friday, March 13, the 138 passengers on board its Hyderabad-Chennai flight (AI 546) got all these and more. As one of them remarked, the airline was indeed living up to its marketing tagline, “A feeling called India”.


  The experience began shortly after boarding commenced at Shamshabad airport before the scheduled departure time of 9.15 p.m. using the aerobridge at Gate 26. As the cabin crew welcomed the travellers on board, an unmistakeable odour began to assail them, literally wafting through the floorboards. When some passengers began to make small talk about the air quality, the crew were seen hurriedly using air fresheners which only masked the dank smell temporarily. The stench was soon back during the dinner service.

The Seahawks did indeed find their quarterback of the future in 2012. Only, they did so in April in the draft with Russell Wilson and not in free agency in March, when they signed Flynn to a three-year deal worth up to $26 million with $10 million guaranteed. Give the Seahawks credit that they didn’t stop adding quarterbacks after signing Flynn, who had famously made just two career starts in four years before signing with Seattle. He made more than $1 million a pass attempt with the Seahawks, traded by Seattle in 2013 after losing the job to Wilson and throwing just nine passes in 2012.

One recent afternoon, clutching a spray bottle as a prop, Winder demonstrated hygiene to an attentive class of fourth-graders at Grangeville Elementary. Most of the kids were aware of the coronavirus, and several said they were already touching elbows instead of doing hand shakes or high fives. Some also boasted they knew to sing most of the popular Baby Shark song while washing their hands.
 "And when you cough, cover it with your elbow," Winder reminded them.
 Many of the prevention protocols are similar to what health experts already push during bad influenza outbreaks. Winder left the class feeling encouraged.
 "The kids already know a lot," he said. "You can tell they want to do the right thing, they want to not spread the germs, they don't want to get sick, they've all been sick."
 But hospital officials say this may be the easiest demographic to convince that there is a serious health crisis looming. Like in a lot of rural America, Grangeville's population skews older. You'll also tend to find an inherent mistrust toward institutions and the government in rural Idaho, where there are already lower than average vaccination rates.      Conspiracy theories and misinformation are said to be spreading like wildfire on social media. And it's clear some people just aren't that worried.      Outside Cloninger's Supermarket, Jennifer Rogers said she sees the coronavirus as just another bad flu with inconvenient symptoms.
 "To me, it feels political," Rogers says. "It's an election year and there's always something big that happens during an election year."
 For now, Rogers said she isn't doing anything out of the ordinary to prepare.      "I mean, if it were close to home and I knew somebody and I could see their reactions and it was super bad, then it would obviously heighten my awareness," she said.
 But nearby, Gail Solveria traded a handshake for an elbow bump and said she was stocking up with a two-week supply of groceries and medicine should there be a need to isolate. People around here are used to having to be prepared for things like bad weather, she said. And Solveria works as a caregiver for a 93-year-old man.
 "We're trying not to fear, you know, and stay level-headed and trust in God," she said.

 The summer before college was a bittersweet one since we were going to school on opposite ends of the state. One evening, after a couple of beers and episodes of “Scrubs,” we made the mistake of sleeping together even though I was in another relationship. Soon after, I decided we had wasted enough drama on each other and it was best to end things for good.

What can Congress do about silencing a bunch of mouth-breathing yahoos? I think any normal person would steer clear of anyone wearing a mask whether they were white, black, or Asian.

How that plays into charges of "racism" isn't exactly clear to me. I mean, the yahoo didn't call her a "diseased Asian" (substitute your own racial epithet).


  I'm sure that those who are already predisposed to hate Asians (or anyone not of their "tribe") have gone out of their way to insult Asian-Americans. They'd do that without the Covid-19 threat. They do it because they're ignorant.

Sheikh claimed that other repair store owners he speaks with in a WhatsApp group are pivoting to the food industry instead. Whereas others are importing face masks and antibacterial hand gel en masse to capitalise on the fear around the outbreak.

Ragland stressed the importance of small town community hospitals like Citizens. He said they are critical for residents.


  “In a small community like ours, having a place where citizens can get treated, whether it be for something simple like a bruise or a broken bone up to gastroenterology, is very important,” Ragland said. “To have a hospital this close is really a benefit for our community.”


  Ragland said he had received treatment at the medical center during his life, remembering how he once ended up in the emergency room after breaking his finger at a church.


  “My mother was very upset, but I came here and got everything fixed,” he said.


  Thomas said providing services like that is a point of pride for the hospital staff.


  “We take pride here in providing access to high-quality health care to the community,” he said.


  That service is becoming more and more rare in Alabama.


  Pickens County Medical Center, near the Mississippi State line, announced earlier this month it will be closing, and in the story regarding that announcement, al.com quoted the Alabama Hospital Association as saying "88 percent of rural hospitals operate in the red, and 75 percent of all Alabama hospitals operate in the red.


  “In all, 13 hospitals have closed in the last eight years, seven of which were rural … Researchers at the health care analytics firm Chartis Group say that 12 of Alabama’s 45 rural hospitals are ‘most vulnerable’ to closure based on several factors — including revenue, system affiliation and the lack of Medicaid expansion.”


  Despite this recent bad news, Citizens continues to provide care in specialties such as cardiology, family practice, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, nephrology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, otolaryngology, pediatrics and diagnostic radiology.

An updated systematic review published by the Cochrane Collaboration found that AA leads to increased rates and lengths of abstinence compared with other common treatments. On other measures, like drinks per day, it performs as well as approaches provided by individual therapists or doctors who don’t rely on AA’s peer connections.


  What changed? In short, the latest review incorporates more and better evidence. The research is based on an analysis of 27 studies involving 10,565 participants.


  The 2006 Cochrane Collaboration review was based on just eight studies and ended with a call for more research to assess the program’s efficacy. In the intervening years, researchers answered the call. The newer review also applied standards that weeded out some weaker studies that drove earlier findings.


  In the last decade or so, researchers have published a number of very high- quality randomized trials and quasi-experiments. Of the 27 studies in the new review, 21 have randomized designs. Together, these flip the conclusion.


  “These results demonstrate AA’s effectiveness in helping people not only initiate but sustain abstinence and remission over the long term,” said the review’s lead author, John F. Kelly, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Recovery Research Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital. “The fact that AA is free and so widely available is also good news.


  “It’s the closest thing in public health we have to a free lunch.”


  Studies generally show that other treatments might result in about 15% to 25% of people who remain abstinent. With AA, it’s somewhere between 22% and 37% (specific findings vary by study). Although AA may be better for many people, other approaches can work, too. And, as with any treatment, it doesn’t work perfectly all the time.


  Rigorous study of programs like Alcoholics Anonymous is challenging because people self-select into them. Those who do so may be more motivated to abstain from drinking than those who don’t.


  Unless a study is carefully designed, its results can be driven by who participates, not by what the program does. Even randomized trials can succumb to bias from self-selection if people assigned to AA don’t attend and if people assigned to the control group do. (It may go without saying, but we’ll say it: It would be unethical to prevent people in a control group from attending Alcoholics Anonymous if they wanted to.)


  Despite these challenges, some high-quality randomized trials of Alcoholics Anonymous have been conducted in recent years. One, published in the journal Addiction, found that those who were randomly assigned to a 12-step-based directive AA approach, and were supported in their participation, attended more meetings and exhibited a greater degree of abstinence, compared with those in the other treatment groups. Likewise, other randomized studies found that greater Alcoholics Anonymous participation is associated with greater alcohol abstinence.


  Alcoholics Anonymous is often paired with other kinds of treatment that encourage engagement with it. “For people already in treatment, if they add AA to it, their outcomes are superior than those who just get treatment without AA,” said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University professor and co-author of the new Cochrane review.


  Alcoholics Anonymous not only produced higher rates of abstinence and remission, but it also did so at a lower cost, the Cochrane review found. AA meetings are free to attend. Other treatments, especially those that use the health care system, are more expensive.


  One study found that compared with Alcoholics Anonymous participants, those who received cognitive behavioral treatments had about twice as many outpatient visits — as well as more inpatient care — that cost just over $7,000 per year more in 2018 dollars. (Cognitive behavioral treatments help people analyze, understand and modify their drinking behavior and its context.)


  Another study found that for each additional AA meeting attended, health care costs fell by almost 5%, mostly a result of fewer days spent in the hospital and fewer psychiatric visits.

 Henry has been one of the best players from the Mission League for several years. He was a travel ball teammate of McDonald’s All-American Ziaire Williams of Chatsworth Sierra Canyon.

He helped St. Francis come back from a devastating 61-39 defeat to Santa Clarita Christian in the Southern Section 2AA final.
 “Just to be able to play in a state championship game is a dream come true,” he said before the CIF announced the tournament had been canceled. “We’re going to be in an NBA arena, which every player dreams of. The last time we were in a championship game it didn’t end well. We’re going to try to make this memory last forever.”
 Wolfson, who won a state title coaching West Hills Chaminade in 2014, said Henry ranks among the best players he has coached on and off the court.
 “When he was a freshman, we had to clean up after serving the homeless at a soup kitchen,” Wolfson said. “He made sure the place was spotless. He was the last to finish cleaning. That’s Andre.”
 Said Williams, “Andre is like my brother. He’s a great player but even better person. He’s a team-first guy. He’s going to do great things at Irvine.”
 Henry has many days of playing basketball ahead, and all those touched by his humbleness and leadership will be rooting for him long after this week of turmoil and uncertainty passes in our minds.

When Freight and Rail Brewing Co. opened in Downtown Calhoun earlier this month, it was not only a celebration of a two-year journey for the company’s owners, but also, they hope, the beginning of something brand new in the area.


  Andrew Tierce, Justin Childress and Dakota Rasbury, the partners in the enterprise, said that while making high quality craft beer that lures traffic to South Park Avenue is the main priority, they also want the space to become a destination where folks look to spend hang out and spend time talking with their neighbors instead of focusing on their devices.


  “We want the brewery to be a destination area and a meeting place for everyone. In today’s society everyone always has their phones or electronics in hand. We want friends and families to be able to come and have a conversation with each other, play a game, listen to good music, and spend quality time together. We also hope to create more foot traffic in downtown Calhoun, which would create more interest in people investing in businesses downtown,” said Childress.


  Childress and Tierce met two years ago as members of the Calhoun-Gordon County Leadership program hosted by the Gordon County Chamber of Commerce. He said Tierce had this idea to start a brewery and Childress, who works in real estate, said he ought to open it in Calhoun.


  Tierce added that changes in Georgia law helped make the idea a reality, when the legislature in 2016 allowed breweries to begin selling their product directly to customers. Before that, he said, breweries were only allowed to sell to distributors.


  The brewery officially opened during the first weekend in March, and business has been good since.


  “We have been getting great feedback on the beer and the place in general,” said Tierce. “I think the most significant feedback we have received is overwhelming support of ‘Calhoun really needed something like this.’ I love hearing that because we really wanted to be a huge part of bringing some modern entertainment to our area.”


  Childress and Rasbury both work in real estate, and while searching for potential commercial building rehab projects, they came to the South Park building that had previously been owned by Jimmy Payne.


  Rasbury said the buildings had been unoccupied his entire life, mostly used as storage, and were in poor shape, but he saw potential. However, Payne was reluctant to sell.


  “After three or four visits, he finally agreed to sell them,” said Rasbury.


  The buildings include five store fronts — four on South Park Avenue and one on Oothcalooga Street.


  Freight and Rail Brewing Co. operates the brewpub in the corner space and the one on Oothcalooga, and the other three spaces will be filled by Trackside Pizzeria and Pub. Work is currently underway to rehab the space next door to the pizza restaurant.


  ## Making beer


  While Tierce had done some home brewing in the past, scaling up to a microbrewery was a challenge, and the team learned a lot along the way.


  “We have learned a ton about not only the complexities of the beer-making process but the complexities of the licensing process. There is so much more to opening and owning a business than most people think,” Tierce said.


  Paul Trail, head brewer at the Freight and Rail Brewing Co., said he first discovered the world of craft beer after moving from Gordon County to Montana and attending a beer festival.


  Trail said the event changed his whole world and inspired him to attend the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago to learn how to make beer. Since then he’s worked doing just that back in Montana, Tennessee and Virginia, but he’s glad to now be home.


  “I never thought it was going to be possible. I thought if I was ever going to come home I would have to give up brewing,” he said.


  The Sonoraville High School graduate has been busy lately, brewing a variety of Indian pale ales, a brown ale, an oatmeal stout, a red ale, a blonde ale and more. The plan is to slowly build up a good supply for their taproom based on customer feedback and then begin offering to-go services like growlers and eventually cans.


  Childress said long term, they may consider a second location, but short term, Tierce said, they are focused on Calhoun.


  “We definitely want to concentrate on our local market and community at first. We want to focus on making beers that people love. Once we establish some brands we will push into distributing draft beer. We want our beer in places that people go to specifically enjoy great beer,” said Tierce. “The taproom model continues to dominate in the craft beer industry and as long as that stays true we will look to expand into a second location at some point.”


  The other main goal to be create a space that is family friendly and comfortable, with live music, board games, televised sports and other offerings. Childress said the business is making folks happy and the future looks bright.


  “The feedback has been nothing but positive,” he said. “We think people have been waiting for something like this for a long time.”
