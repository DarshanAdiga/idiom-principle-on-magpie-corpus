A 31-year-old Warroad woman was arrested early Thursday after attempting to escape pursuing law enforcement officers aboard a stolen John Deere 4320 tractor.
 According to the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded to a theft report of a tractor at 3:38 a.m. that had just occurred in the area of 100th Avenue and 250th Street South, north of Hawley.
 The caller reported that his tractor and trailer was being driven through a soybean field by the woman.
 When deputies arrived and located the tractor and attempted to conduct a traffic stop on it. The driver refused to stop and the deputies continued to follow the suspect for approximately a half-hour. The driver continued through fields in the area and deputies were able to maintain sight of the tractor. Eventually the deputies were able to direct the path of the tractor out of the field and into a swampy area, where it became stuck.
 Nicole Rae Cloud was taken into custody for motor vehicle theft, fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle, criminal damage to property and two outstanding warrants for her arrest. She was transported to the Clay County Jail in Moorhead.
 Members of the Hawley Police Department and Barnesville Police Department assisted with the capture.

I love a good story.
 Who doesn't?
 Even the contrivances employed to make a good story work can be fun.
 I mean fiction in this case, not journalism.
 In journalism, acting on the precept, "Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story" can get you into serious trouble - or a job offer from FOX News.
 But in fictional stories, you can start off with a rousing line to get your reader's attention.
 Something like, "It was a dark and stormy night …"
 Now, who can resist reading further?
 And, of course, an unbelievably evil villain can be contrived, as well - Snidely Whiplashes, for instance, tying fair damsels to the train tracks.
 This is a villain so vile, so willing to promote his own self interest that he would affix the object of his affections to the local Amtrak line to demonstrate the sincerity of his devotion.
 People like that can't truly exist.
 And that contrived behavior, of course, gives the hero - Dudley Do-Right in this case - the opportunity to save the fair damsel in the nick of time.
 And there's always plenty of time to round up the bad guy before the end of the episode.
 Clever contrivances utilized to push a fictional story along can actually be implemented in journalism, as well.
 Though inventing villains would get you in trouble - or that aforementioned job with FOX.
 But there are many journalists - or writers attempting journalism - who employ novelistic techniques.
 An easy example would be "In Cold Blood" by Truman Capote, which he termed a non-fiction novel because of his use of novelistic techniques to tell the true story.
 Not that I'm saying Capote led the book off with, "It was a dark and stormy night …"
 I just like that opening.
 All of which brings us to a current story you might have some familiarity with, the pandemic.
 Is it possible that a true story can be so vast as to defy the use of techniques employed in fiction, that the scope is too great?
 Kurt Vonnegut once wrote something about the power of writing - where you can create all manner of cataclysmic scenarios with nothing but imagination and a page to fill.
 I tried to find the exact quote but couldn't. So I'll have to trust my memory.
 But the point was you didn't need all manner of special effects or whatever as you would to create a movie.
 And Vonnegut did write about such topics as the end of the world and mankind's evolution into a slightly dolphinesque species, among other things.
 So what happens when the story is of such an unbelievable scale that even clever contrivances from the fiction world are overwhelmed by the facts?
 Or, in other words, which applies,
 Art imitates life
 or
 Life imitates art?
 Aristotle held to the former while Oscar Wilde posited the latter.
 What would they have made of the pandemic affecting the entire planet and how to portray it appropriately?
 How the hell do I know?
 However, another classic contrivance in the world of fiction, old enough to have been corny in Aristotle's day, cannot come to the rescue of this story. And that's even though it's been used with less plausibility in thousands of cases to get a writer out of a difficult yarn:
 "It was all a dream …"

Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said the president preferred to emphasize the positive. “Despite Democrats and the media’s coordinated attempts to criticize this president for providing hope and optimism throughout this pandemic, President Trump has delivered a message of comfort, unity and strength while taking bold actions,” he said.
 Mr. Trump’s reticence to talk about the human toll of the pandemic conflicts with his occasional willingness to describe the personal impact of America’s wars, visiting Dover Air Force Base to greet the bodies of slain troops and telling audiences later about “crying mothers and wives.”
 In those cases, however, the tragedy fuels his policy positions, bolstering his eagerness to pull American forces out of what he calls the “endless wars” of the Middle East. In this case, focusing on the grief from the coronavirus could be politically damaging if the public blames him for playing down the threat of a deadly virus that he had boasted was “something we have tremendous control of” and would “miraculously” disappear on its own.
 Instead, he would prefer to talk about China’s mishandling of the original outbreak or how the economy will, he hopes, roar back to life once stay-at- home orders are lifted. On Thursday, the day after the death toll hit 60,000 in the United States, he spent much of the day railing against prosecutors and defending his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, whom he himself fired for lying about his contacts with Russia.
 Other presidents considered the mourner in chief role to be part of their presidential duties, a responsibility to help a nation grappling with tragedy by acknowledging its grief and finding a path forward. Craig Shirley, a longtime Republican operative and Reagan biographer, said he and other presidents like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt could connect with everyday people because their self-confidence “gave them the power to exhibit compassion and empathy.”
 “It takes a strong man to open his heart,” Mr. Shirley added. “But it also makes a very good and memorable president.”
 Few had more experience with that than Roosevelt, who came to office at the depths of the Great Depression when millions were out of work and hungry, then presided over World War II with hundreds of thousands of young men sacrificing for their country.
 “In virtually all of F.D.R.’s talks, he played a pastoral role,” said Susan Dunn, a Williams College professor and an author of several books on Roosevelt who cited a series of speeches and fireside chats. “He was always empathetic, and even when he was talking about economic dislocation, unemployment, etc., he introduced spiritual notes.”
 In more recent times, Mr. Bush found himself repeatedly called to comfort a nation beset by terrorism, war, natural disaster and financial collapse. Only three days after Sept. 11, he stopped by the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York to meet with relatives of those killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center. He was supposed to visit for a half-hour but stayed for two hours and 20 minutes, hugging and talking with hundreds of people in encounters that were so heart-wrenching that aides and even Secret Service agents cried.
 “He was really passionate about connecting with people especially because he took this type of tragedy so personally,” said Eric Draper, the White House photographer who accompanied him that day. “He used that passion to express his remorse and sadness, but also to connect with people to make them feel better. He would say it wasn’t about him. It was about the presidency and he wanted to share the presidency with them.”
 Mr. Obama never had to cope with a tragedy as horrific as that, but he presided over a series of mass shootings and racial episodes that tore at the country. After the children were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Jon Favreau, his chief speechwriter, found the president in the Oval Office struggling to hold his composure, a grief that Mr. Obama then displayed moments later on camera in the briefing room with tears streaming down his face.
 “In five years of watching him, I’ve never seen Trump display a shred of empathy or grace towards another human being,” Mr. Favreau said. “I’m not sure he has that capacity, at least he’s never shown it in public.”
 Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide to Mr. Trump, said that sort of display does not come naturally to him. “The president does prefer promoting a public image of strength,” Mr. Nunberg said.
 Any contacts with grieving relatives have remained out of sight. When Mr. Trump received a thank-you letter from someone he knew mentioning that the writer’s mother had been told she had the coronavirus, the president called to express concern, according to an official who asked not to be identified.
 The only time Mr. Trump has made a point of publicly meeting with victims of the coronavirus came in mid-April when he hosted several survivors in the Cabinet Room, an event that seemed aimed at least in part at proving he was right in promoting hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment, since a few of them had taken it.
 Since then, a study has cast doubt on the drug and Mr. Trump has stopped mentioning it as often. But David Mangan, one of the survivors invited to the session, said in an interview this week that the president seemed genuinely interested in his guests and made sure that one of them who had Lyme disease saw a White House physician afterward.
 “The part of the day that was not captured by any of the media was the personal connection he had with us before the cameras were let in and after the cameras were dismissed from the room,” said Mr. Mangan, 57, a pharmaceutical sales account representative from Hot Springs, Ark., who was joined by his wife, Rachel Mangan, who was also infected by the virus and recovered. “He came across, I think, compassionate. I think he wanted to hear our stories.”
 Mr. Mangan said Mr. Trump should do more to show that side of him. “His role should show hope and inspiration, but I also think it should show compassion,” he said. “There are a lot of people that are experiencing a lot of fear, so I do think it has a time and a place.”

Some, most notably women, say they are paying close attention to the allegations, which gave them pause.
 Alex Sink, a donor and former Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, said she was “not happy” to read about the allegations against Biden. While she still plans to vote for him, she worried his campaign was too quick to categorically deny Reade's story.
 “They put themselves immediately out on a limb by saying, ‘It didn’t happen, we categorically deny it, it’s not true,’” Sink said.
 Some female Democratic operatives expressed concerns the allegation is particularly damaging because it’s an indictment of Biden’s central campaign rationale: that he provides a moral counter to Trump and that the election is a “battle for the soul of America.”
 “The stakes could not be higher for defeating Donald Trump — but at the same time, I think we have to apply a consistent standard for how we treat allegations of sexual assault, and also be clear-eyed about how Donald Trump will use these allegations in the general election campaign,” said Claire Sandberg, who worked as Bernie Sanders’ organizing director.
 The silence from the Biden campaign has given Republicans an opening on an issue that was, in 2016, more fraught for the GOP, when Trump was asked to answer for the more than two dozen women who alleged varying levels of sexual assault and harassment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News on Thursday that Biden will “have to participate in releasing all the information related to” the allegation, a stance he didn't take when Trump faced misconduct accusations.
 The GOP argues Democrats aren't being consistent, pointing to aggressive questioning and coverage of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he faced an allegation of sexual assault.
 Speaking about the allegation for the first time on Friday, Trump said Biden “should respond” before proceeding to criticize the treatment of Kavanaugh as “an absolute disgrace to our country.”
 Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said “the left, and their media allies, has one standard for Republicans and another standard for Democrats like Joe Biden.”

In an ideal and pragmatic situation, Savannah Development Policy Think Tank would have thought that the proper utilisation of the said money would have been the involvement of various radio stations within the jurisdiction of all the MMDA’s in the preparation of jingles with messages on Covid 19 to be run in the local languages of the people for effective and efficient utilisation of the allocated resources for public education in the fight against the Covid 19 pandemic. Savannah Development Policy Think Tank is also of the opinion too that the best approach would have been the active involvement of the NCCE as a constitutionally mandated body charged with the responsibility of mounting public education to the generality of Ghanaians to carry out public education in the fight against the Covid 19 pandemic.   Savannah Development Policy Think Tank is still of the opinion that all is not lost in the fight against the Covid 19 pandemic especially with the allocation of one hundred thousand Ghana cedis each to all the MMDCEs across the country. Savannah Development Policy thinks tank, therefore, demands nothing short of judicious use of such scarce resources for the direct benefit of the people as that is the desired effect for which it has been intended for as any short of this would not be acceptable and would be challenged to the hilt for the benefit of the people with the intended purposes of mounting public education on the Covid 19 pandemic.

“I don’t know what will happen to the kids we care for,” Egge said. More than 70% of the clinic’s patients come from low-income families.
 Hospitals, clinics and physicians’ offices across the country have seen a steep drop-off in business during the coronavirus outbreak as medical centers limit nonessential procedures and patients stay away, fearful of getting ill.
 That prompted Congress to earmark $100 billion in emergency assistance for medical providers in the most recent aid package. But it left the distribution of this funding to the Department of Health and Human Services.
 The department initially allocated money based on providers’ Medicare revenues, a calculation that favored hospitals and physicians that care for large numbers of elderly patients.

Officials in five states have accused the White House of hijacking supplies they scrambled to obtain given the lack of federal support. In just one example, the federal government seized 500 ventilators ordered through a private company by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, as his state was staring down its peak surge in coronavirus cases.
 According to Gabriel Sherman’s reporting in Vanity Fair, it’s Kushner who all along has urged Trump to ignore Democratic governors. Kushner insisted that he had his “ own projections” and knew better about the needs of various states than public health officials. This from a guy whose idea of getting up to speed on infectious disease was to ask his brother’s father-in-law, an ER doctor, to solicit advice about the pandemic on Facebook.
 Kushner also claimed to have set up a deal with Google to create a disease- screening website, which Trump crowed about. That was pure fantasy. On the other hand, Silicon Valley luminaries did build crucial software to match hospitals and suppliers, only to have Kushner ghost them and instead tell the hospitals to stop complaining.
 All in all the crisis has presented Kushner with a stellar opportunity to do what he’s best at: Tell the opposite of the truth. Ignore real expertise. Treat a ghastly threat to our lives and livelihoods primarily as a danger to the stock market and thus to Trump’s reelection.

MADISON – Gov. Tony Evers has directed the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) to issue guidance on adjustment service companies and encouraged Wisconsinites to take care before hiring a company to help them tackle their debts.
 “Adjustment service companies with strong ethics can play an important part in times of economic hardship,” said DFI Secretary Kathy Blumenfeld. “People need help making budgets, developing strategies to reduce debt, and negotiating with creditors, and they need it from organizations that will treat them fairly and keep fees to a minimum. Adjustment service companies can fill this role, provided they act with the character this moment demands of us all.”
 In light of the financial distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, DFI encouraged Wisconsinites to work with licensed adjustment service companies that have agreed to comply with Wisconsin law requiring low fees, honest advertising, and character and fitness. “Doing so will better ensure that you end up working with an organization whose primary focus is helping people in need, rather than taking advantage of them,” DFI Secretary Blumenfeld added.

Secondly, it should go without saying that our hospitals and medical personnel should be given everything they need in order to ready themselves as our first line of defense against this pandemic. Tragically, what we have seen is the exact opposite, with heartbreaking reports that health workers continue to work without Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and that from an initial one million dollars in disbursements, less than 6% have been allocated to hospitals, as a lion’s share has gone to government institutions that do not even deal with disease management. In fact, we are dismayed to learn that the Minister of Finance has written to commercial banks asking for a moratorium on loan repayments for parliamentarians, yet it did not occur to him to extend this relief to nurses and doctors, who ought to even be exempted from income tax until this storm passes. Understandably, it is these acts of neglect towards health workers that have caused them to stage sit-ins and suspend health services across the country, and what government needs to do is simply act on their demands, not dismiss them as unreasonable. If any of our medical facilities and personnel are overrun by Covid-19 cases, it will be because the Mutharika Administration refused to attend to their needs.

You're not even positive where they are anymore.
   
 That box of pictures is surely in storage, but nobody's looked at them in ages; you meant to scrapbook those childhood photos and pics of your sibs but you never quite got to it.
   
 In a century, will someone even want them? Unlike the brothers in "Tombstone" by Tom Clavin, nobody's made movies about you.
   
 Wyatt Earp had not been looking for a long-term place to live.
   
 Once, he thought he had that sewn up, but then his young wife and their baby died and by 1876, he'd forgotten about family life and was just looking for a job with a salary.
   
 He'd been kicking around out West and had met his best friend, Doc Holliday, while on the job as a bounty hunter, but Earp was ready to move on and up. When Dodge City officials called on his peacekeeping expertise, he leaped.
   
 Somewhere in him, though, he had wanderlust. He wasn't in Dodge City long before he left, a little bit disgusted by the town's politics. He'd heard that the place to be was a new town in lower Arizona, so Earp headed to Tombstone, along with some of his brothers and their womenfolk and "wives."
   
 That, as it turned out, was good for Doc Holliday, too.
   
 For much of his adult life, Holliday had suffered from consumption (tuberculosis) and was quite frail by the young age of 27. By the fall of 1881, however, Tombstone gave him a fresh lease on life; he'd even harked back to an earlier career as a dentist by taking on clients.
   
 While it was true that Tombstone had a wild reputation, that fall, it appeared things were settling down. Earp's brother, Virgil, was the town's marshal, and Wyatt and Morgan Earp helped keep the peace when needed.
   
 Virgil was no fan of Holliday, but he put up with him for Wyatt's sake. What Virgil couldn't abide, though, were the cowboys who came to Tombstone to rabble-rouse. The Clanton Brothers, and the McLaury's, for instance. They were real trouble ...
   
 If it seems as though you've heard most of this before, well, yeah, you probably have. Or, much of it, anyhow, but not all. There's a lot of backstory to what happened at the OK Corral, and "Tombstone" sets it up.
   
 Here, you get more than the usual history as author Tom Clavin often turns his focus on the people who surrounded the Earps in Arizona, giving readers a keener you-are-there feeling and counterbalancing everything Hollywood's ever said.
   
 That view gives this almost-140-year-old story a fresh perspective, as if you're seeing everything from a saloon rooftop, from the back yard of a brothel, or from next to a water trough. It helps that Clavin's style is light and easy to enjoy.
   
 Be aware that there are a lot of individuals in this story, most of whom demand attention, but you won't mind giving it if you're a history buff or fan of the Old West. For you, then, "Tombstone" is picture-perfect.

Boy, do I miss the good old days.
 I know I haven’t been here very long but in my short time here I have gotten to experience a bit of normalcy before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown.
 What am I talking about? Government meetings.
 When I first started covering these meetings for the Index-Journal, I was getting immersed in being right in the action — or lack thereof — of the public meeting.
 Seeing each member face to face and getting to read the reactions of the room give context to what is happening.
 Since most public meetings have been postponed indefinitely or moved to teleconference, much of this is lost in technology.
 Now, don’t get me wrong. I am a huge fan of technological advances and I think some of the options for moving these meetings to the virtual world are pretty cool.
 Not to mention it opens up access to more people to get involved in what their government is doing.
 But, if you can’t attend one of these meetings, I’ll be there to let you know what happened.
 Another thing that is lost in these virtual meetings is discussion. Often times, it is really informative when councilmembers or attendees get to ask questions and discuss topics.
 Most of the time during these virtual meetings, discussions are limited with troubles over muting/unmuting as well as poor audio quality at times. A number of these problems could be fixed with the right equipment but the quick descent of COVID-19 had many entities scrambling to get the basic necessities accomplished.
 I have a feeling we will be getting back in the same room pretty soon. I hope.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said Thursday his office will audit the business waiver program implemented during the coronavirus pandemic as tensions flare among Republicans over the administration’s unwillingness to reveal more information about the process itself.
 “The question we need to find out is, could more businesses have been open in light of staying safe with social distancing, and were they essential to make sure we were providing services that were needed – and was this done in a fair process,” DePasquale said during a news conference. “This may not be the last time Pennsylvania has to confront something like this. We want to make sure we as a state and as a country are better prepared moving forward.”
 The announcement comes – somewhat coincidentally, he said – two days after Senate Republicans asked for an audit of the process as complaints from shuttered businesses continue mounting.
 "I had said when the pandemic was done … there were certain things we’d review. This is something that is certainly in our wheelhouse,” DePasquale said. “But I’m not going to sit here and tell you that [letter] had no impact on our office doing it. The question was always about timing.”
 Last month, Gov. Tom Wolf said businesses forced to close amid the coronavirus pandemic could apply for an exemption through the Department of Community and Economic Development. DCED Secretary Dennis Davin said the agency received more than 42,000 requests in the two-week window that closed April 3 and approved – or clarified no exemption was needed – more than half of those who applied.
 Senate Republicans have pushed – repeatedly – for the administration to publicize the list of waiver applicants after complaints about unfair and illogical denials flooded their district offices. Sen. Mike Regan, R-York, in his capacity as majority chairman of the Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committee, set an April 29 deadline for the DCED to produce the list and about a dozen other documents detailing the agency’s process for approving and denying waivers – an ultimatum that went unanswered.
 “Legislative action may be necessary to correct these inequities, both as part of the ongoing pandemic, as well as for any future emergencies,” Regan said during a committee meeting Thursday. “In order to determine the necessity, scope and terms of any legislative action, it is essential that the legislature have access to relevant information regarding the requests for waivers and the administration’s response.”
 “The governor even mentioned that maybe this may be the best way to go,” Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, later told reporters. “All we are looking to achieve in this was what was the criteria used to determine that some businesses were allowed to be open and some were not.”
 DePasquale reiterated that Wolf has signaled his administration will cooperate with the audit.
 “He made it very clear that his team is going to very open and that his team would give us everything we need to do an independent, thorough investigation,” he said.
 Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, R-Allegheny, criticized Republicans for going forward with the subpoena despite the impending audit, calling it “an incredibly wasteful, offensive and political.”
 “A duplicative review of the same program and information is a waste of taxpayer resources and takes our administration’ s officials away from fighting COVID-19,” he said. “As the United States crossed 60,000 deaths from COVID-19, Senate Republicans called a last-minute Senate Committee meeting to try to attack the Governor who has decisively and steadfastly led our state through this outbreak.”
 Regan signed two subpoenas — one for the governor and a second for DCED — after his committee voted 7-4 on Thursday to move forward with the process. No Democrat supported the motion.
 "This subpoena is not about transparency,” said Sen. Lindsey Williams, D-Allegheny. “It is about a political stunt. It is about driving up to Mount Wolf and serving a subpoena on the Governor with a camera crew in tow.”
