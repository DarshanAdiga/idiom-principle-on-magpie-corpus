WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. government advisory panel endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Thursday, putting the country just one step away from launching an epic vaccination campaign against the outbreak that has killed close to 300,000 Americans.Shots could begin within days, depending on how quickly the Food and Drug Administration signs off, as expected, on the expert committee’s recommendation.“This is a light at the end of the long tunnel of this pandemic,” declared Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.In a 17-4 vote with one abstention, the government advisers concluded that the vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech appears safe and effective for emergency use in adults and teenagers 16 and over.That endorsement came despite questions about allergic reactions in two people who received the vaccine earlier this week when Britain became the first country to begin dispensing the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.While there are a number of remaining unknowns about the vaccine, in an emergency, “the question is whether you know enough” to press ahead, said panel member Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He concluded that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.The decision came as COVID-19 cases surge to ever-higher levels across the U.S., with deaths setting an all-time, one-day record of more than 3,100 on Wednesday.Pfizer has said it will have about 25 million doses of the two-shot vaccine for the U.S. by the end of December. But the initial supplies will be reserved primarily for health care workers and nursing home residents, with other vulnerable groups next in line until ramped-up production enables shots to become widely available on demand — something that will probably not happen until the spring.Next week, the FDA will review a second vaccine, from Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, that appears about as protective as Pfizer- BioNTech’s shot. A third candidate, from Johnson &amp; Johnson, which would require just one dose, is working its way through the pipeline. Behind that is a candidate from AstraZeneca and Oxford University.U.S. health experts are hoping a combination of vaccines will ultimately enable the U.S. to conquer the outbreak.Still, experts estimate at least 70% of the U.S. population will have to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the point at which the virus can be held in check. That means it could be several months before things start to get back to normal and Americans can put away their masks.All eyes now turn to the FDA staff scientists who will make the final decision of whether to press ahead with large-scale immunizations with Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine. FDA’s vaccine director Dr. Peter Marks said a decision would come within “days to a week.”Dr. William Moss of Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the expert panel’s review, welcomed the outcome, saying, “Given how bad the pandemic is now, we need to move.”The independent review by non-government experts in vaccine development, infectious diseases and medical statistics was considered critical to boosting Americans’ confidence in the safety of the shot, which was developed at breakneck speed less than a year after the virus was identified.Regulators not only in Britain but in Canada have already approved the vaccine for use in their countries, and President Donald Trump and White House officials have complained for weeks that the FDA was moving too slowly.“Americans want us to do a scientific review, but I think they also want us to make sure we’re not wasting time on paperwork as opposed to going forward with the decision,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said before the meeting.FDA scientists issued a glowing review of the vaccine earlier in the week. Agency staffers said data from Pfizer’s ongoing study of 44,000 people showed strong protection across different age groups, races and health conditions with no major, unexpected safety problems.The Pfizer- BioNTech shot remains experimental because that final-stage study isn’t complete. As a result, the expert panel wrestled with a list of questions that have yet to be answered.For example, while the vaccine is more than 90% effective in blocking the symptoms of COVID-19, the FDA’s advisers stressed it is not yet clear whether it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for up to half of all cases.“Even though the individual efficacy of this vaccine is very, very, very high, you really as of right now do not have any evidence” that it will lower transmission, said Dr. Patrick Moore of the University of Pittsburgh. He urged Pfizer to take additional steps to answer that question.Several of the dissenting panel members objected to authorizing the shot for 16- and 17-year-olds, given their small numbers in the study and the low risk they face from COVID-19.Members worried, too, that Pfizer will lose its opportunity to answer critical questions once it begins offering the real vaccine to study participants who had been getting dummy shots up to now.The company proposed gradually moving those patients to the vaccine group, with priority based on age, health conditions and other factors. Under that plan, 70-year-old participants would cross over before healthy 30-year- olds.Pfizer must still show whether the vaccine works in children younger than 16 and in pregnant women.On the safety front, as widespread vaccinations begin, the first recipients will be closely tracked by government health authorities, since studies in tens of thousands of people can’t detect side effects that strike 1 in a million. Hanging over the meeting were the British allergic reactions and a warning from authorities there that people with a history of serious reactions shouldn’t get the vaccine for now.Pfizer representatives said they have seen no signs of allergic reactions in their trial. But some of the FDA advisers fear the British warning will deter millions of Americans with allergies who might benefit from the COVID-19 vaccine from giving it a try, and urged additional studies to try to settle the issue.“This issue is not going to die until we have better data,” Offit said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Ryan’s defensive tackles coach Aaron De La Torre found himself watching film of junior Mason Davis during some downtime before practice on Monday. He pointed to two of Davis’ three sacks from the Raiders’ 35-21 win over Frisco Lone Star, but it wasn’t to brag about his instincts, how quickly he got off the ball or that he manhandled everyone.
 All of those things were true, of course. But that wasn’t the point De La Torre was trying to make with his film study.
 “This is what I mean. Watch what he does — sack; everyone is celebrating. But not Mason,” De La Torre says with a chuckle as he points at the screen. “He just got a sack and is like, ‘OK … back to work.’ No reaction.”
 Davis is one of the more dominant, under-the-radar players the Raiders have on their defensive line and arguably turned in his best performance of the season that night.
 He tallied 11 total tackles, including four for loss, to go with three sacks, five pressures and three quarterback knockdowns. Ryan (9-0) held Lone Star to 150 total yards and 11 first downs while winning its sixth straight district title. But whether you were watching the game live or catching highlights in slow motion on De La Torre’s computer, you’d be hard-pressed to see Davis show an ounce of emotion.
 “It’s like he’s just clockin’ in for work,” De La Torre said. “He’s a hard worker.”
 Davis agreed that he has a long way to go in the showing emotion department. But he admits if there is anything that gets him juiced mid-game, it’s that he gets to play with his twin brother, Michael.
 Michael Davis, who is one minute older than Mason, is a starting wide receiver for the Raiders and shares a similar blue-collar approach to making big plays. It is that team-first attitude and hard-work mentality that the No. 1 Raiders want to emulate as they begin their postseason journey on Friday against Dallas Bryan Adams at C.H. Collins Athletic Complex.
 “I want to celebrate [when I make a play], but I can’t bring myself to do it,” Mason Davis said. “It’s just not my personality. But when I’m on the sideline, I’m watching Michael and getting excited over his big plays. It’s a special experience. Not many people can say they get to play with their twin while also playing for a program like Denton Ryan.”
 His brother agreed.
 “I don’t celebrate much either now that I think about it — unless it’s when Mason makes a big play,” Michael Davis said. “It actually helps that he’s on defense, and I’m on offense. There’s nothing more exciting.”
 Other than winning a state title, of course. The Davis brothers were on last year’s team that lost to Alvin Shadow Creek in the state title game. They also watched as Ryan came up short in the state semifinals in 2016, 2017 and 2018. This year, Ryan has been the No. 1 team in the state since the preseason and has maintained that perch courtesy of a regular-season schedule that has it looking far more battle-tested than in years past.
 The Raiders opened the year with back-to-back wins over Class 6A teams Arlington Martin and Guyer. While they weren’t tested much after that, they closed the year with solid wins over Frisco Independence and Frisco Lone Star, both of whom are playoff-bound. The Lone Star game was a rematch of last year’s state semifinal, a game Ryan won 35-7.
 While the Davis brothers made their mark on last year’s team, they’ve seen their production increase tenfold this year. Mason is a key cog in an extremely disruptive pass rush that includes five-star recruits Keithian “Bear” Alexander and Texas commit Ja’Tavion Sanders along with Jay Sheppard and Michael Gee.
 Through nine games, Mason Davis has 47 total tackles, 17 for loss, and six sacks.
 “I just trust that if I go out there and do my job for this team, then the rest will work itself out,” Mason said. “I take a lot of inspiration from guys like Earnest Brown and Mario Edwards Jr. [who came before me]. I want to be like them.”
 While Mason has turned into a defensive star, Michael made the leap from being a back-up linebacker to taking on a more significant role on offense. He comes into Friday’s game with 10 catches for 183 yards and two touchdowns despite missing some time with an ankle injury. Fully healthy, he represents a deeper receiving core than in years past. And as a result, Ryan has the No. 2 offense in the area among Class 5A teams with an average of 496.67 yards per game.
 They are No. 4 in scoring with just shy of 47 points per game.
 “There are a bunch of guys like me who can step in and help this team,” Michael said. “I enjoy being one of them.”
 Ryan coach Dave Henigan agreed.
 “[Michael and Mason] are good football players, but they are also good kids,” Henigan said. “They bring character to our program. They do the right things. They are good students, and they work hard. They are also team oriented. They are bringing a lot of intangibles in addition to the fact that they are really good players.”
 Mason and Michael Davis say it’s all in a day’s work. They rarely argue about anything, and they almost always pick up on what the other is thinking.
 And right now, their singular focus is on helping Ryan finish what it started.

“Coach Bloesch has been trying to get me for a while, ever since my sophomore year,” Blair said shortly after committing. “The relationship we have had over the years was the big thing for me.”
 Bloesch joined UNT’s staff in the offseason as the Mean Green’s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach.
 Blair, a 6-foot-3, 303-pound senior, has 15 scholarship offers from teams that compete on the Football Bowl Subdivision level. Blair said Colorado was his top choice but ran out of scholarships in its class for offensive linemen.
 Blair quickly turned to UNT after finding out that Colorado was out of the picture. He visited UNT before the coronavirus pandemic forced the school to postpone recruiting visits.
 “The facilities are nice,” Blair said. “I have been living here all my life and know North Texas.
 “It will be neat to play for the hometown team. When I was little, I played for a Mean Green flag football team.”
 Blair was a first-team All-District 5-6A selection last season and an honorable mention pick on the Class 6A Associated Press Sports Editors All- State team. He is rated as a three-star prospect by 247Sports. The website lists him at No. 17 on its list of the top center prospects in the 2021 class.
 Blair plans on signing with UNT on Wednesday, the first day of the early signing period.
 Blair said UNT’s coaches have told him they believe he is capable of contributing as a freshman. UNT’s staff projects Blair as an interior lineman who could play guard or center.
 “North Texas is a great fit for Gabe,” Guyer coach Rodney Webb said. “He’s a huge get for them. He’s a national recruit who had opportunities at Power Five conference schools all over the country.
 “He decided to he wanted to be close to home and play in front of family and friends. It says a lot about the direction UNT is going and the kind of kids they can attract.”
 Webb believes Blair has all the tools to be an impact player on the college level.
 “He’s the most athletic big guy I have coached in 30 years,” Webb said. “He’s a 6-3, 303-pound kid who moves like a skill kid. He has a level of tenacity that you can’t coach.”
 Guyer is one of the elite programs in the state and will face Coppell in a bi- district playoff game on Saturday at C.H. Collins Athletic Complex. The Wildcats played in the 6A Division II state title game against Austin Westlake last season.
 UNT has been trying for years to establish a recruiting pipeline to the talent-rich Denton ISD schools.
 Blair credited UNT’s success under coach Seth Littrell for making the program more appealing. The Mean Green played in three straight bowl games beginning in 2016 before a tough 4-8 season last fall.
 UNT is 3-5 heading into its regular season finale at Apogee against UTEP on Friday. The Mean Green are holding out hope that a win against the Miners will land them in a bowl game.
 “It could open up doors,” Blair said of his decision to play for the Mean Green. “Guyer could start funneling players into UNT. They have started to turn it around the last couple of years. That made me consider them more.”
