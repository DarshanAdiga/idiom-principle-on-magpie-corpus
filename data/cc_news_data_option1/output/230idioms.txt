DOVER, Del. (AP) — It looks like some kind of a crazy laboratory straight out of the future. It turns out that Dover’s Doug Wood is the mad scientist behind all those large blue barrels bubbling with water and fish that are the key ingredients to growing four types of organic produce. Inside the warm environment of a greenhouse that sits just off Del. 1 and the Simms Woods Road overpass in north Dover, Mr. Wood is in the process of starting up his 302 Aquaponics business, which will eventually harvest four types of organic lettuces, tilapia (fish) and local honey from beehives. While Mr. Wood also has a traditional farm that sits just down the road, it is his new business that focuses on producing greens in water that has him excited. With more than 15,000 square feet of available space inside his greenhouse, which will make his business the largest commercial Aquaponics greenhouse in Delaware, things are really starting to take off. “I bought a greenhouse from a guy who used to sell flowers in Smyrna. He just got out of it. It was a hoop building,” Mr. Wood said. “I put it out on my farm up the street and was doing hydroponics — working with tubing and building all kinds of stuff myself, drilling holes in four-inch pipe, and I did it that way and introduced fertilizer in a liquid form. That’s straight up hydroponics. “Then I was messing around and said, ‘I want some fish,’ because I didn’t want to use synthetic fertilizer or man-made products, so I got interested in the fish (tilapia) being the fertilizer and it was a hobby that kind of turned into, ‘Let’s try this as a commercial venture.’ It was a hobby that will hopefully become a big commercial business.” Mr. Wood, a Milford native, is a lifelong resident of Kent County, and he wants the fruits — well, vegetables — of his...

 “I believe Madeleine was the victim of an opportunistic criminal whose act was random – she wandered out of the apartment and into the path of this person.

I caught the houseplant bug early on, and have enjoyed the fever ever since.
 Interest in houseplants has proven cyclical. Indoor plants can trace their beginnings to Ancient China and Babylon, but it wasn’t until the 1800s, with the development of central heat in homes, that houseplants became easy to grow, and interest thrived in Victorian times.
 Activity ebbed and flowed in the following decades, and revived strongly with the hippie movement of the ‘60s and ‘70s, when houseplants were in high demand to fill the macramé plant hangers that were suspended from most living room ceilings. Bottle cutting became fashionable, and homemade glass terrariums created plant demand.
 Now comes another surge in houseplant activity, with an intensity that hasn’t been seen in a generation or two, and millennials are to thank. They’ve been blamed for dooming all sorts of things, like beer and golf, but they’re credited with reviving a slagging U.S. houseplant market that has surged 50% in the last three years to over $1.7 billion annually, according to the National Gardening Association.
 Why the houseplant fever? I’m a generation or so beyond millennial, so I’m depending on what’s being said by others who have assessed the situation.
 It’s well-known that millennials are delaying major milestones like marriage, buying a home and having children, largely for financial reasons, and home prices keep millennials renting. Because connections with other living things seems a natural human instinct, millennials seem to be turning to plants for part of that connection.
 Plants usually require less immediate attention than other living things, such as pets. In fact, plants are becoming substitutes, at least temporarily, for both pets and kids. Houseplants don’t die or soil the rug if you’re gone for several days.
 Renters don’t have to worry about their landlord’s pet policies, and having indoor plants is usually a non-issue.
 But there’s a greater force driving the current craze. Millennials’ desire for houseplants has collided with their engrossment in social media. Plant photos and care tips are everywhere, especially Instagram and Facebook. Never has a generation had such a wealth of information at their fingertips.
 New friends are made, and new terms coined, like “plant parent” and “plant coach.” Social media has introduced houseplants to an entire generation, and they’re sharing what they learn.
 Although social media creates the spark and fans the flames, millennials are taking it a step further and seeking in-person plant gatherings, cutting swaps and houseplant seminars. Like-minded plant enthusiasts feel they have a support community, sharing knowledge and experiences.
 Houseplants also mesh well with the health philosophies of the millennial group, which is nicknamed the “wellness generation.” They value the physical and mental health benefits that plants provide.
 What types of houseplants are trending with millennials? For their plant purchases, millennials would rather visit locally owned garden centers than national chains. Houseplants with colorful foliage are popular, as are succulents with unique shapes and textures.
 Rare, collector-type houseplant varieties are becoming sought after, often fetching premium prices. Such plants are displayed and enjoyed as one might splurge on a higher-priced piece of art.
 How long will the current houseplant popularity cycle last? Time will tell, but speaking from personal experience, once the bug bites, you’re bitten.

So don't use anything to stir it up. Instead, don't be shy about pouring your hot water -- go ahead and dump it in there. Just be careful not to overfill.
 Most toilet backups aren't total clogs, so there's a good chance yours will drain slowly at first. Keep an eye on the water level and, as it drops, continue to add more hot water to keep it full. If the clog isn't too stubborn, the added pressure of a full toilet bowl should help usher the backed up matter through pretty quickly.
 ## If all else fails, time is on your side
 The worst-case scenario is that the clog is wedged too tightly in place and the above steps don't push it down right away. If that happens, you don't have to call a plumber or head to the hardware store just yet.
 Try giving it some time to let that hot soapy water work on breaking up the clog. Walk away, close the bathroom door, and wait 30 to 60 minutes before you check on it again. When you do, you may be pleasantly surprised to find your problem has been flushed down the drain.

As the National Finance Chair for the Ted Cruz for President Campaign, Langston helped raise more than $92 million, the most in a Republican primary up until then.
 Cruz, a Republican U.S. senator from Texas, regards Langston as one of his closest friends. “I love him like a brother,” Cruz said. “He’s truly a Godly man, with a heart for Jesus and wisdom that is truly uncommon.”
 Cruz said Langston exemplifies integrity.
 “In every instance, he endeavors to do the right thing, and he does so with a quiet humility,” Cruz said. “He lives in the Word of God; he’s a man of prayer. In times of trouble, I rely on his judgement.”
 “He’s brilliant, and he can impress the savviest Wall Street investors, but he has kept his small-town East Texas roots and common sense. Willie is a good man, with a good heart, making a profound difference in Texas and our nation.”
 Langston graduated fifth in his PHS class of 1977. He was captain of the football team and most valuable player in baseball, receiving All District Honors in both.
 Langston was student body president and president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. His classmates voted him “Most Representative.”
 Langston graduated Summa Cum Laude from Texas A&M University in 1981. He was president of the Business School and Baptist Student Union, and led the founding of the Annual Business Career Fair in 1980, now one of the country's largest college career fairs. He received his master's degree from Stanford Business School in 1985.
 Langston was born in Palestine in 1959 to Willie and Vaude Langston, making his first home in a garage apartment near Memorial Hospital.
 Currently, he is a board member of Breakaway Ministries, a Bible study ministry at Texas A&M University; a member of the Mays School of Business Advisory Board at Texas A&M University; chairman of the Deacons, a 1,000-plus organization at Second Baptist Church in Houston; and chairman of Glorieta Christian Camp, a 3,000 bed, 2,400-acre camp near Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he and his wife met in 1979.
 Langston is a former board member of The Star of Hope, the fourth largest homeless shelter in the United States; former chairman of the board of Houston Christian High School; a former outside investment advisor to the Texas A&M Foundation; and former Trustee of the 12th Man Foundation. He is also past president of the Houston Children’s Educational Opportunities Foundation, and a past president of the Houston Chapter of the Stanford Business School Alumni Association. Additionally, in 2007, Langston received the Outstanding Businessman of the Year award from the Mays College of Business.
