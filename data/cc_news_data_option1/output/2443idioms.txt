China reported 22 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, including 13 in Beijing, a day after a city government spokesperson said containment measures had slowed the momentum of an outbreak in the capital that has infected more than 200 people. Another nine cases were brought by Chinese travelers from outside the country, seven of them on board a flight from Riyadh in Saudi Arabia that arrived in the western city of Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, according to a notice from the provincial government. While the situation in Beijing is headed in the right direction, “the prevention situation remains grave and complex,” city spokesperson Xu Hejian said at a Monday news conference. The Beijing outbreak took hold in a huge wholesale food market crowded with workers and buyers. Additional cases traced to the same outbreak have been found in neighboring Hebei province and nearby Tianjin city.

Ramesh Kymal, former Chairman and Managing Director of wind turbine manufacturer Siemens Gamesa India, has taken the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
 Kymal, a doyen of the Indian wind industry, was at the helm of the company since it was set up a dozen years ago.
 While Kymal refused to comment on his move, sources told _BusinessLine_ that he has sued the company over unpaid dues to him.
 In turn, Siemens Gamesa has filed a case against him on the grounds that he has initiated corporate insolvency resolution proceedings against the company on fraudulent grounds.
 “Ramesh Kymal has initiated proceedings against Siemens Gamesa basis certain illegitimate and wrongful claims, which is being strongly contested by Siemens Gamesa before the National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai,” Samudra Sarangi, Siemens Gamesa’s lawyer, told _BusinessLine_ on Sunday. “The matter is currently sub judice and, as such, it would not be appropriate to comment on the same at this juncture,” he said when pressed for details.
 Kymal is an industry doyen who began his career as an executive at NEPC Micon Ltd, the first company to set up wind turbines in India. Later, he was the CEO of another wind turbine major, Vestas, between April 1996 and February 2009.
 He is credited with building Gamesa India from scratch. Under him, the company grew to become one of the top wind turbine sellers in India, selling machines worth 6,200 MW since it began its operations in 2009. It has two blade factories, in Nellore (Andhra Pradesh) and Halol (Gujarat), a nacelle factory in Mamandur (near Chennai) and an operations and maintenance centre in Chennai. In November 2019, Siemens Gamesa India bagged the Deming Prize for quality.

In the middle of the Ladakh saga, India quietly passed an important economic milestone. The nation’s foreign exchange reserves crossed half a trillion dollars, and are now among the top five in the world. Thirty years ago, on the eve of the historic 1991 reforms, the country’s reserves had dipped to below one billion dollars. It was a foreign exchange crisis which precipitated the emergency, pledging and airlifting of gold to London, in exchange for a rescue. No one was willing to provide imported goods to India on credit due to its low reserves. That led to the historic reforms, opening up the economy, effecting deregulation in industry, trade and banking, and the rest is history.

PLAINVILLE -- For nearly 80 years, there were countless comings and goings from the building at 142 South St. in the town center, from firefighters and the fire department's dalmatians to elected officials, municipal employees and residents stopping in to do business with the town.
 Now it's the building itself that has come and gone.
 After a few weeks behind a chain-link fence while asbestos was removed from its aged frame, the building known most recently as "the old town hall" has been demolished. The last of the walls came down just last week, leaving the building's life-long neighbor -- the historic Humphrey House that is home to the Plainville Historical Commission and town museum -- to preside over the entrance to Telford Park alone.
 The building's removal comes a little more than a year since town offices moved from the cramped World War II-era facility to the new town hall just down the street at 190 South St.
 Town Administrator Jennifer Thompson said the town had a study performed to determine whether it would make more sense to keep and renovate the building for parks and recreation use, or build new.
 "The study revealed it would be more cost effective and feasible to build something new rather than renovate," she said via email. "Town Meeting then approved the demolition of the old town hall."
 Given the town's current financial situation, she said, "there are no immediate plans to build a parks building," though that is the hope for some future point.
 "For now, the lot will be cleared and gravel will be placed in the lot where the town hall once was," she noted.
 Bittersweet moment
 For those who spent many years working in the building -- either as elected officials or town employees -- the demolition is bittersweet.
 "I have mixed emotions. It's another piece of Plainville history that's no longer with us," said Town Clerk Ellen Robertson, who worked in the building for 11 years before the move to the new town hall.
 But it was a building that had stopped being useful to the operations of a growing town in the 21st century, and one that, after being used constantly -- and for more than one purpose -- since 1941, had nothing further to offer.
 Robertson recounted her visit to the building back in 2008 when she went to pick up nomination papers to run for town clerk.
 "I remember the first thing that hit me was the smell," she said. "It smelled musty and moldy and I thought, 'what am I doing?' I thankfully followed through."
 While the building itself "was terrible" -- in its last years the toilets were constantly overflowing, the roof frequently leaked, the heating was wonky, the air was stale, and the space was overcrowded -- Robertson said "the great group of people that worked in that building" made up for the shortcomings until the town was finally able to invest in new facilities.
 Former long-time Selectman Robert Fennessy said the building was "quaint" and "had the feel of a small town, where everyone watched out for each other."
 But there was very little separation between those who worked in the building and those who dropped in on town business "because the quarters were so tight." The selectmen's "meeting room," for example, was also the town administrator's office space for many years, and a half door was the only thing that separated the town clerk's office from a closet-sized hallway space in front of it where residents stood to conduct business with members of the staff.
 "It definitely had a warm feeling, although the warmth did not come from the 50-year old-burner in the basement," Fennessy quipped.
 He said he will miss seeing the old building, "but I feel good that we now have a new building that will take us through the next 50 years."
 Assistant town accountant Annemarie Eisele, who worked for many years in the building, also said it's bittersweet to see the old building gone. When she saw photos of the pile of rubble showing up on social media recently, she admitted, "I kind of teared up a little bit."
 "But it was more like, 'wow, that's 19 years of my life just sitting there, going down," she said. "It was a strange feeling, but it needed to come down."
 For the future, she said, "personally I would love to see a rec building for the park department there, so they have a place to go on rainy days and they don't have to go running to buses to go over to the schools."
 Fennessy agrees.
 "I always thought that the location was ideal as a teen center, as it borders the town park, and maybe in better fiscal times the town can look at developing it for a new program," he said. "But right now, I'm sure the park commissioners will appreciate the added parking space as they bring in more and more participants in their activities."
 From fire station to town hall      At the end of the day, the town got quite a bit of use out of the old building.
 Its first purpose was as a fire headquarters, replacing the original fire station on Spring Street known to some today as "the Scout House." It was built in 1941 on the site of the former waiting station for the local trolley, next to the then Plainville Library inside the Humphrey House, according to Historical Commission Chairman Kristine Moore.
 Construction began in late spring of 1941, with the foundation laid and walls taking shape by July 13, 1941. It was nearly complete by Aug. 5, 1941, just about four months before the U.S. entered World War II.
 Then town offices would eventually occupy a small section of the fire station closest to the town park entrance. In 1973, the town built a combination police and fire building just down the street to meet the need for more adequate and updated space for the departments -- the now former public safety building that is presently up for sale by the town.
 Once the fire department exited 142 South St., the building was renovated and re-purposed solely for town offices.
 Moore noted that as the building was being taken apart recently -- an operation that had to be done carefully so as not to potentially damage the Humphrey House -- "the ghosts of the old fire station were observed throughout the building" -- from the outline of the old garage bays, to the outline of the windows the hoses would be draped from, and the mount for the old fire pole still present on the second floor. There were even the names of former firefighters etched into the walls and door frames.
 From an historical standpoint, she said, "it is very difficult to see yet another building of Plainville's past become only a memory."
 "It was sad to learn that the building could not be salvaged due to the asbestos and would meet the same end as   the old Wood School. It will certainly be strange from now on, looking at the Humphrey House and not seeing its neighbor," she said. "I have lived in Plainville my entire life, and like the Wood School and Falks Market, the (old) town hall has always been around; it was as familiar and recognizable as my own home and will be missed."
 The Historical Commission, she said, has an "abundance" of photographs of the old fire station/town hall from its construction to its demolition. Many of these are available to see on the commission's Facebook page and are also on display at the Humphrey House.
 A documentary exploring the history of Plainville's town offices and public safety is available on the commission's YouTube Channel: Plainville Historical Commission PHC.
