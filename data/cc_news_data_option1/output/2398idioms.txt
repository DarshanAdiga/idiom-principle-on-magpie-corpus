Campfires and marshmallows go hand in hand, but did you know you can poke your thumb (or a spoon) into a toasted marshmallow to create a hollowed marshmallow shooter glass that you can fill with Bailey's (or other liqueur) and eat/drink the entire thing in one glorious gooey gulp? Now that is camping, Camp Cocktails style!

“David Luiz had a shocker at Manchester City because there were no fans in the ground, but unless he is asking for huge wages Arsenal should keep him,” Merson told the _Star_. “His contract is up and I’d be shocked now if he got another one, but if he’s not asking for a lot of money and it’s not going to break the bank, I’d keep him all day long.

Moreover, watery fun is on its way soon to Dunbar neighborhoods, the mayor noted.          "City Council last Monday approved us purchasing the equipment for a portable sprinkle park," Cunningham said. "The components are all movable, so we'll be taking the sprinkle park through the neighborhoods in the city day to day and week to week.          "It'll give kids the opportunity to get out and have some fun. It's quite simple and not extremely expensive, especially compared to setting up a full-fledged sprinkle park."          Cunningham said the equipment for the sprinkle park has been ordered and should be operational sometime this month.          "We also made arrangements with the water company to obtain a hydrant meter so we can monitor the water being used and reimburse them for it," he said.          Cunningham was appointed as mayor three years ago by the Dunbar City Council, to replace Terry Greenlee, who resigned the mayoral post to take a position with the West Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Administration.          At the time of his appointment, Cunningham said he would not seek re-election. As a result of June 9's primary election, Dunbar City Council member Greg Hudson won the Republican mayoral nomination. Former Dunbar City Police captain and current City Works Director Scott Elliott won the Democratic nod to face Hudson in November's General Election.          Cunningham said he believes the city will be well served by the candidates who are on the General Election ballot.          "Everybody on the ballot who made it through [the Primary Election] has been invested in Dunbar for years," he explained, "and active in what goes on in the city. I think they'll be an asset in the future.          "Both candidates running for mayor are very active in the city. Each has their strengths, both are great men, and either one will do a great job for the city. Their hearts are in it and they're committed," Cunningham said.

Ring out the church bells for Juneteenth.                           Let them be bells of joy because on June 19, 1865, a U.S. Army officer stood on the balcony of a stately Galveston, Texas, residence and read General Order No. 3: "The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free."                           Gen. Gordon Granger was referring to the Emancipation Proclamation, by which Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves of the Confederate States.                           But ring as well a mournful bell. General Order No. 3 also informed Texas' ex-slaves "that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere." Though destitute -- even their clothes belonged to their former masters -- Uncle Sam wouldn't extend a helping hand.                           A step forward, followed by a step back. That has been the story of race relations in America from that day until President Donald Trump's aborted choice of Juneteenth for an election rally in Tulsa, Okla., the site of a 1921 mass murder of blacks.                           So ring a bell of praise for Harriet Tubman and Sarah Grimke. Tubman escaped from slavery, found refuge in Philadelphia and returned to Maryland to free upward of 80 enslaved people. Born into a slaveholding South Carolina family, Grimke secretly taught enslaved children to read until her father caught her, then she also moved to Philadelphia and became a prominent abolitionist.                           But ring a bell of shame for Lincoln's successor, President Andrew Johnson. More sympathetic to former slaveholders than to former slaves, he sabotaged the plans of congressional Republicans for a reconstructed South with equal rights for blacks and whites.                           Ring a bell of praise for congressman Thaddeus Stevens. It was his idea to confiscate the estates of the largest Southern property owners and distribute the land in 40-acre allotments to former slaves. He blocked the South's attempt to bar ex-slaves from voting. "This is not a white man's government!" he thundered.                           But ring a bell of shame for the bureaucrats of the Freedmen's Bureau, the federal agency that transferred the confiscated land. They gave the bulk of it to wealthy Southerners.                           Ring that bell again for the unsavory deal the two parties cooked up after the disputed presidential election of 1876. The Republican candidate got the White House and the Democrats got white supremacy restored in the South, their base of support. Army units enforcing Reconstruction were withdrawn, and blacks were resubjected by Jim Crow state governments.                           Ring a bell of sorrow for the thousands of black people lynched and a bell of shame for U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. He is holding up federal anti-lynching legislation because he claims it could send perpetrators of minor injuries, a cut or a bruise, to prison for 10 years.                           Ring a bell of joy for W.E.B. Du Bois. A co-founder of the NAACP, in 1894 he became the first black person to earn a Harvard Ph.D.                           Then ring a bell of shame for the U.S. Supreme Court's 1896 decision allowing "separate but equal" public accommodations. By legitimizing segregation, the justices completed the destruction of southern blacks' civil rights.                           Ring a bell of joy that school segregation was outlawed by the 1954 Supreme Court decision that separate could never be equal. Ring a bell of thanks for Dorothy Brown's parents who fought for her right to an integrated classroom.                           Ring it again for Rosa Parks. Her refusal to sit in the back of a Montgomery bus triggered the civil rights movement and made Martin Luther King Jr. its prophet.                           Ring a bell of sorrow for the black schoolgirls -- Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair -- killed by the 1963 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., church. Ring it again for King and all the other martyrs of the fight for civil rights.                           Ring a bell of joy for the election of President Barack Obama and the eight years of hope it gave that the death of racism was at hand.                           Ring it again for the massive, multiracial protests that followed the killing of George Floyd whose last words -- "I can't breathe!" -- provided the rallying call for the Black Lives Matter crusade.                           And finally, ring a bell of hope that renewed activism will finally make racism abhorrent to all Americans, be they Republicans or Democrats, liberals or conservatives.

Dunbar Mayor Bill Cunningham is seeing some some exciting developments throughout his city in coming days and weeks, signs of progress and renewed optimism after months of COVID-19 concerns and cancellations.          The ability to conduct business in the city is returning incrementally back to normal in the "new normal," for example.          Dunbar City Hall reopened for walk-in business on June 11. "We have been been semi-open for quite a while, but we were doing by appointment only then," the mayor said.          Social distancing requirements and restrictions remain in effect for City Hall employees and visitors. "City Hall prepared inserts into the doors of the clerks' offices so that no one has to enter any of the work areas to access the personnel to pay bills or get information or anything at all," Cunningham said. "Thanks to DuPont, we have a more than adequate supply of sanitizer. All of that's in place."          The mayor said repairs to the Dunbar Senior Center have also resumed recently.          "Right when COVID-19 hit, we were in the process of doing a renovation to the Senior Center, stripping asbestos tile flooring," Cunningham said. "The contractor we had scheduled had to hold up on the project because he didn't have the workers [during the COVID-19 shutdown]. Since the lifting of some of the restrictions, he has his people back in. The tile has been stripped out and they're preparing the floor for painting. In the next couple of weeks, we should have all of the furniture back in, and we're working on having limited programs in place in the Senior Center."          New opportunities for work and play are taking place throughout Dunbar, too, he noted.          The city announced recently that a Taco Bell restaurant will be constructed in the near future. It will be located between the TLC Lube & Wash Car Care Center and the Subway restaurant on Dunbar Avenue, near the Dunbar Shopping Plaza.          "From the plans we've seen, it's going to be a 50-seat Taco Bell. I don't know any other Taco Bells in the area that seat that many people. It's pretty exciting," said Cunningham.          "A lot of things like this are due to the traffic Dunbar is getting from the Shawnee Sports Complex. We get a tremendous amount of business when they're in operation. Numerous people have come and talked to us the past couple of years about coming to Dunbar. The Sports Complex is definitely a shot in the arm for the City of Dunbar for business and traffic.          "Our overall sales tax revenue has increased since they've been open," Cunningham added. "Those are the things that you can measure the success of something by."

Murphy's deprived us of our rights
   
 I social distance. I wear a mask. I stay home. I avoid crowds. I wash my hands. I sing Happy Birthday. I do this because it is smart and I want to stay safe. I urge my fellow citizens to be smart and stay safe.
   
 However, I am troubled by the governor's emergency COVID-19 declaration. The governor has unilaterally deprived me of my constitutional rights. Freedom of assembly and the freedom of association have been suspended for an indefinite period. No governor should be able to suspend constitutionally guaranteed rights without some sort of oversight. It is unfair to allow Walmart and Target to sell clothing while Boscov's was forced to close. RiteAid sold cosmetics while J & M Beauty Supply was shuttered. All businesses should be allowed to open if they meet health safety guidelines or only essential products should be allowed to be sold. The government should not be picking winners and losers. I am retired and do not rely on a paycheck. Most folks are out of work and are struggling. Governor Murphy's hair is always neatly trimmed. I thought barber shops were closed. The pain is not being shared equally.
   
 I call upon the legislature to limit all emergency declarations to 28 days unless extended by the legislature. I call upon the legislature to require that all businesses and all citizens in the affected area to be treated equally.
   
 I plan to practice safe social interaction even when the declaration is lifted. I want to protect myself and those around me. I urge you to follow suit. Stay well.

 Pence's lies
   
 To say something erroneous from ignorance or stupidity is something that should be challenged and confronted. But to lie knowingly is criminal when it causes others to suffer disease and death.
   
 Vice President Pence violates his so-called "pro-life" position and his own profession of the Judeo-Christian faith when he openly and brazenly lies about testing causing the rise in COVID-19 coronavirus infection rates. Shameful.

 North Wildwood's illegal dune destruction
   
 The City of North Wildwood was caught illegally destroying dunes and developing along the coast. In the past few months alone they destroyed at least 8 acres of vegetated dunes. This is a serious problem because dunes help hold our beaches in place and prevent erosion. More importantly, they act as a natural defense against storm surges and storms. By taking down dunes and building restaurants, North Wildwood will increase impacts from flooding and storm surges, putting more people and property in danger.
   
 It is extremely short-sighted of North Wildwood to destroy huge swaths of important dunes while building a bulkhead and restaurant that will only make things worse. The city didn't have any required permits because it wouldn't have been able to get them. This shows flagrant disregard for the environment and public safety. Vegetative dunes and coastal marshes are one of the best ways to protect homes from flooding, sea-level rise, and storm surges. The city is opening areas up for more damage and flood impacts, which could impact people's flood insurance.
   
 It is important that DEP is holding North Wildwood accountable for violating important coastal protections. There were a lot of complaints about them illegally destroying dunes, so it is good that they finally acted. At the same time, the state still needs to fix Christie's rollbacks to many of these permits like the CAFRA loopholes. We also need to integrate climate change into every rule and regulation while changing flood maps to mitigate disaster. Restoring dunes, natural systems, and moving buildings back from harm's way should be the priorities right now.

Last month, WalletHub did a study on the effects of COVID-19 on working mothers. This month, in light of Father’s Day, they’ve released a similar study on working dads.          “Traditionally, dads have been the breadwinners and moms have been the caregivers,” Hofstra University Assistant Professor Nicholas Salter, Ph.D. said. “Nowadays, though, more fathers want to be active parents and push back against this old-fashioned idea.”          According to Salter, people sometimes look down on dads for taking time off work to be with their children.

Campaigners have said this "inclined plane" would be the only one of its kind in the UK and that the boat lift would be the most modern one "in the world".
 The project is expected to cost between £12m and £15m, and predicts annual visitor numbers of around 60,000-90,000 a year initially, but its ambitions go further and aim to kickstart a cycle of regeneration, economic development and the creation of a vibrant, thriving independent retail sector.
 Construction could take two to three years, meaning it could be up and running within around four years.

With a constantly evolving style, Harris strives to paint light with beautiful brushstrokes in each of her paintings. She loves the feeling of putting the paint on the canvas using a “wet in wet” technique and adores layering and creating unusual textures. As a child, Harris spent many long summer vacations with her grandparents and cousins in the countryside of western North Carolina where there were cows, chickens, horses, birds, as well as many dirt roads, forests, and fields. Much of her art now reflects her fond memories of those bygone days and disappearing landscapes.          Harris was selected as this year's Featured Artist of the Old Homes Tour. Unfortunately, the Beaufort Historical Association had to cancel this event. However, her work may be viewed online at https://beauforthistoricsite.org/honor-old-homes-tour, on the Mattie King Davis Art Gallery Facebook Page, or in person at the Mattie King Davis Art Gallery located at 130 Turner Street, Beaufort, N.C. The gallery is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. Harris will be the Featured Artist for June and July. Be sure to take a peek at her beautiful work, as it is already flying off the walls!
