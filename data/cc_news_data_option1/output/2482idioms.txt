So, the mortality rate, instead of being a fixed number that distills the true essence of the virus’s danger, is actually a protean, organic, fluid metric. The rate of fatalities among COVID-19 cases “is not a biological constant,” according to a team of Oxford researchers. “Instead, it reflects the severity of the disease _in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population_.” Even with perfect data, the mortality rate is a living number, changing all the time, that is in part a reflection of ourselves. With these limitations in mind, we should be wary of using any one estimate of mortality in shaping our response to the pandemic.

 After ending last week as road warriors, the Van Meter High School softball team kept it going Tuesday night as they traveled to battle non-conference foe Clarke High School.
 Despite a rough start, the Bulldogs ended up pulling things together late to end their losing skid and win 7-5. Van Meter came off of a three-game losing skid and put an end to that courtesy of five runs scored across the final two innings of play against the Indians. Van Meter returned back to normal form, being rather efficient with their scoring efforts as they touched up seven runs on just eight total hits. Despite the outcome, the battle began quite inauspicious for the Bulldogs as the watched the visiting Indians post up a 3-0 advantage following the third inning of play.
 Van Meter ended up answering with offense of their own, plating two runs in the fourth inning to cut the lead down to one heading into the fifth inning. Overall, there were only two scoreless innings across the whole game, and for both teams, they came in the first two innings of action. Following Van Meter's answer in the fourth, the host Indians added two more runs in the bottom of the fifth, widening the Bulldogs' deficit 5-2 as the sixth inning approached. From there the Van Meter offense seemed to step it up a notch. They kicked off the sixth inning by plating three runs to even out the score at five runs apiece. When Clarke couldn't answer in the bottom half of the sixth inning, Van Meter took advantage by posting up two more runs in the top half of the seventh inning. That gave the Bulldogs their first and only lead of the game 7-5 which they would then ride out to their fifth overall victory of the 2020 campaign.
 Overall there was plenty of offense to be happy with for coach James Flaws and the Bulldogs. That included a highlight performance by sophomore Shea Rhodes who went 1-for-3 on the night with that one hit exiting the playing field for a three-run home run. The trio of Maia Abrahamson, Lilly Thompson, and Mac Blomgren also had games to remember, all striking two hits for the contest. Aside from Rhodes and her home run, the other Bulldogs who drove in runs were Thompson, Macy Blomgren, and Molly Blomgren.
 Inside the circle, the pitching duties belonged to Macy Blomgren who once again showcased her skill very well. The freshman pitched the full seven innings and 151 total pitches while dishing out a season-second best mark of eleven strikeouts. Blomgren also issued just three walks and two earned runs for the contest.
 Next up for the newly minted 5-5 Bulldogs will be a return trip back home where they will battle conference foe ACGC in a doubleheader beginning with game one first pitch at 5:30 p.m.

It was a rocky start that just could be overcome as the ADM High School softball team faltered Tuesday night at home, watching their comeback bid fall short in a 5-4 defeat to Bondurant-Farrar.
   
 The game for ADM was inauspicious from the get-go as the fourth-ranked Tigers found themselves in a 3-0 hole following the third inning of play. All together ADM came out of the gates a little sluggish compared to their normal production and that included the hit total. ADM struck just a pair of hits through the first three innings of action. The visiting Lady Jays were able to gain two more runs over the host Tigers for a 5-0 lead heading into the bottom of the fifth inning. That's when the host Tigers came alive on the scoreboard as ADM plated three runs courtesy of four hits from Emily Hlas, Olivia Tollari, Emily Kay, and an Abbie Hlas double that plated a pair of runs.
   
 That sparked new life into the Tiger lineup that struck for four more hits across the final two innings of play. Unfortunately for ADM, the only thing that equated to runs was a Brylee Person RBI single in the seventh which did cut the Bondurant-Farrar lead by one, but it wasn't enough to equalize the game. Despite a flurry of activity in the final frame, ADM ended up suffering their second straight loss.
   
 "I have to give the girls kudos for that comeback (but) we began the game super flat," began head coach Jodi Doty. "We know Bondurant is a team that will come out and gives us their all. Hopefully, the girls will learn from this and can use this for the rest of the week."
   
 Inside the circle, it was a split effort with Abbie Hlas and Aliya Yanga tossing the ball. Yanga took the start and did run into some hot water, giving up six hits and three earned runs. On the plus side, Yanga did toss six strikeouts in the contest. It was a strong test for Yanga that coach Doty talked about following the game.
   
 "Aliya is going to be pretty amazing, it's just trying to give her the opportunities to give her that pressure and to learn how to work through that," said Doty. "Could I have pulled her and not have two girls walk home? Yes, but you can't win a championship today and we've got the team to be 100 percent supportive regardless of who's in the circle. We win as a team and we lose as a team."
   
 Overall, the Tigers struck for eight hits on the night, now giving them 35 for the 2020 season so far. Next up for the Tigers will be another home match up Wednesday, June 24 as they welcome in Boone for a 7 p.m. showdown. The Tigers are 12-9 against the Toreadors since the 2007 campaign.

It may not have been easy, but the ADM High School baseball team churned out yet another win Tuesday night, using a walk-off effort to defeat visiting Carroll by a narrow 2-1 final.
   
 ADM junior Grant Garton was the one to perform such a walk-off honor, giving the Tigers their fourth straight win on a single to left-center field. What started out as an attempt at a squeeze play blossomed into the game-winning hit that now presents ADM with a 4-1 record.
   
 "I just needed to make sure to calm myself down and make contact, luckily I hit it hard and it went through," said Garton. "We really had to fight and grind it out the whole game here tonight."
   
 Watching the ball make its way into the outfield officially marked yet another winning outcome for head coach Jason Book and his squad, an outcome that he himself was not surprised within the slightest.
   
 "I knew these guys had it in them to have this strong of a start to the season," began Book. "These guys are capable of producing a win night in and night out. They've got the talent and they work really well together."
   
 As for Garton's night, his game-winning hit helped to cap off what was a very strong contest for the junior, reaching base safely in all three of his trips to the plate courtesy of three singles. Garton's night officially gives him two RBI so far and six hits which ties Tate Stine-Smith and Zach Fuller for second on the team in total hits (6). Garton effectively produced half of ADM's total hit count on the night with the Tigers striking six hits across all seven innings played. The rest of the hits for ADM came courtesy of Zach Fuller with his sixth hit of the season along with juniors Ethan Juergens and Tate Stine-Smith.
   
 As for the scoring efforts, it was the visiting Carroll Tigers who jumped on the scoreboard first when a passed ball in the top half of the fifth allowed a runner to cross the plate and give hometown ADM fans a slight scare. The host Tigers didn't stand with that deficit for long, as they too produced scoring efforts in the fifth inning. An early hallmark of ADM baseball so far this season has been taking what they've been given and turning it into something big. Within the confines of the fifth inning Tuesday night, ADM equalized the game courtesy of a Carroll error and a passed ball that sent Jordan Green screaming across the plate for ADM's first run of the game before Garton's heroics in the seventh.
   
 "These guys did a great job of staying in the game and making the plays they had to make to win," said Book following the victory.
   
 If anything could overshadow the fireworks by Garton and the Tiger offense, it would have been the pitching performance put forth by fellow junior Cole Williamson. In his first start of the season, Williamson went the distance as the only pitcher coach Book would use through all seven innings Tuesday night. Through 96 total pitches thrown, Williamson allowed just four walks, three hits and one earned run while striking out four batters. Williams allowed Carroll batters to hit just .130 against him and found a way to keep the visiting Tigers off-balance for most of the game.
   
 "I'm used to starting my slider middle-in but it was moving more than I thought," began Williamson. "They were also a little behind my fastball tonight."
   
 Regardless of any rough patches, coach Book himself had confidence in his junior hurler to go the distance and potentially aid in another win.
   
 "It was such a great game and really it was his to win or lose," began Book. "He said he felt good (late in the game) and I trusted him and I wanted to let him do it on the mound and not from the dugout."
   
 The win for ADM continues the good trend by the Tigers as of late, who rested with a 4-1 mark following Tuesday's action. Next up for the Tigers will be another home contest as they will welcome in a stingy conference foe in Boone. As with Carlisle and Indianola, the Tigers will be looking to change the tides as of late against the Toreadors. ADM has not captured a win over a Boone team since the 2014 season and they have not won by more than two runs since they posted 12 runs against Boone back in the 2012 campaign. First pitch is slated for 7:30 p.m.

Housing sales are estimated to decline by 81 per cent to 12,740 units during April-June period of this calendar year due to COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, property consultant Anarock said on Thursday. As many as 68,600 units were sold during April-June 2019 across seven major cities - Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region MMR, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata, Anarock said in a report. New launches may plunge by 98 per cent to only 1,390 units as against nearly 69,000 units in the corresponding period of 2019. A massive drop in both new launches and housing sales were, of course, expected on the back of a complete lockdown for most of this quarter, Anarock Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said. The nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 to curb the spread of coronavirus disease, bringing the construction as well as sales activities to a grinding halt.
