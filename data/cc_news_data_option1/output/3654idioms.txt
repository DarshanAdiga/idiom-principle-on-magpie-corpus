"Broad lawlessness, property destruction, looting and cop-free zones," says Osterwell, serve the revolutionary goal of reducing "the value of whiteness to zero."
 The panicky reaction on the left to PBS' kid-gloves treatment of "In Defense of Looting" drove the "public" broadcaster to issue an apology of sorts.
 PBS acknowledged that its interview had been meek if not milquetoast in failing to challenge Osterwell on some of her more nutty notions.
 Meanwhile, regarding the street hellions of BLM and Antifa, voices fretful of a Trump victory are saying that in the aftermath of the flap over "In Defense of Looting," the Biden campaign is more desperately in need than ever of a "Sister Souljah Moment."
 You'll recall that smarmy Bill Clinton -- infamous horn-dog paw-er of females and Oval Office intern diddler -- was the master of the calculated political gesture now known as the Sister Souljah Moment.
 The Sister Souljah Moment (hereinafter SSM) is the scripted repudiation of an extreme figure or extreme movement in quest of political advantage for oneself. The concept is somewhat akin to the diversionary "straw man" attack.
 Clinton's handlers in 1992 decided he needed to put some distance between himself and certain menacing-sounding militant black figures. He chose a Jesse Jackson Rainbow Coalition gathering for the occasion and hip-hop performer Sister Souljah as his foil.
 Sister Souljah was notorious for her combustive racial commentary.
 She had said, for example, that since "black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?"
 With flawless thespian skill, using the Rainbow Coalition as his stage, Clinton condemned the hip-hopstress for being a black version of Klansman David Duke.
 So spectacularly successful was the stage-managed SSM event that it had Clinton's aides high-fiving and chest-butting over their dramatic triumph.
 Now Biden is being urged to do likewise.
 But can the fumbling, bumbling candidate pull off his own SSM?
 It seems, at a minimum, doubtful.
 Among his noted political qualities, Biden's never been regarded as slick, as in the Bill Clinton "Slick Willie" mold. And it takes a degree of slickness to pull off a successful SSM.
 Furthermore, Clinton's SSM had the advantage of seeming to be spontaneous, although of course it wasn't.
 Might not a SSM II by Biden, at this late point, risk the danger of being perceived as transparently phony politics?
 Quite possibly so, especially since Biden's backers have been openly badgering him for weeks now to go the SSM route.
 Some of our most sagacious, chin-stroking pundits suggest, however, that a Biden SSM would risk alienating the Bernie Sanders/Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faction of the party, a faction now widely regarded as the tail that's wagging the party dog.
 And, as punditry's wise men further note, there are also the volatile street forces of BLM and Antifa to take into account. What effect might a Biden SSM have on them? Would it prompt them to redirect their fury on Biden to his disadvantage?
 On the American far left today, BLM and Antifa are the equivalent of what the Muqtada Militia was back in the days when Baghdad was something like Portland is today.
 But BLM/Antifa's anarchic antics have helped Trump whittle down Biden's big lead in the polls in battleground states. Therefore, might it not be said that maybe, just maybe, the best thing that could happen to Biden at this point would be for him to have these Black Shirt-style agitators turn against him?
 In regard to the "demonstrations" that have convulsed Portland, Seattle and other places, the Democratic Party has taken the classic position up to now that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
 In light of Biden's slipping poll numbers, however, this is looking more and more like it might be a colossal political miscalculation.
 Might not the BLM/Antifa street militias be more useful to Biden as his enemy than as his friend -- if only he could entice them to start trashing his candidacy instead of Trump's?
 Might not a Biden SSM be worth the risk after all?
 It seems an imponderable question. In any event, if the Biden campaign is going to go the SSM route, it had better get the cue cards in place and the stage directions drawn up. And do so ASAP.
 Tick tock, tick tock. Time's running short and the lead is dwindling.

Brazil's largest private bank, Bradesco, is one of   several large financial institutions that are wading heavily into Brazil's pay TV and   communications businesses.
 In December, Bradesco paid nearly $200 million for   one-third of the voting shares in Multicanal, one of Brazil's largest cable MSOs,   with 640,000 subscribers. Following a flurry of share transactions leading up to the deal,   Bradesco bought the equity stake from Globopar, holding company for MSO Globocabo, which   now owns the remaining two-thirds of Multicanal's voting shares.
 The Bradesco investment is part of the growing trend of   Brazilian banks entering the pay TV arena, said Walter Longo, president of pay TV trade   body Abraforte and of Unimark/Longo, a marketing and distribution company. In addition to   the Bradesco deal, he also mentioned a string of banks interested in the country's   ongoing pay TV franchise auction.
 'Grupo Safra is bidding, and Bank of America is   creating a consortium,' he said.
 There's also interest from the Bozzano Simonsen bank,   he said. Some 1,500 licenses in hardwire and wireless cable are expected to be awarded   over the next few years.
 The ability of cable networks to provide data-transmission   services has lured interest from the banking sector, Longo said.
 'Banks want to be in the superhighway business. They   want to be involved in cable, telephony and the Internet, and they want to be leaders in   the new wave of home banking services,' he said
 Bradesco's investment in Multicanal was motivated by   its desire to become a 'data-transmissions provider,' he added.
 Industry analyst Douglas Oaten, however, viewed   Bradesco's motivation as purely financial.
 'It's a company interested in good business, and   this business [pay TV] is a good business,' he said.
 Bradesco has a track record of investing in companies,   building them up and fattening their share-price, with a view toward selling, Oaten said.   Globocabo's decision to increase its stake in Multicanal came as little surprise, he   added.
 'It likes to take control of major operations,'   he said.
 Bradesco and Globopar, which together own 100 percent of   Multicanal's voting shares, have also been strategic partners in several other   ventures. These include Vicunha Comunicaçóes, a consortium that won the B-band   cellular-telephony licenses in Bahia and Sergipe; and TT2, a consortium that plans to bid   for a B-band cellular license in Rio de Janeiro.

The brilliance of Russell Wilson is no longer a revelation but rather an expectation. Given encouraging latitude to spread his wings, the quarterback delivered on cue Sunday in the Seahawks’ season-opening win over Atlanta.
 But there was a new wrinkle in this game, an energy, a vibe, that fairly rippled across the field. Jamal Adams was acquired to be a difference-maker for a team that had slowly but steadily lost the defensive verve that once made the Seahawks special. And in their utterly convincing, not-really-that- close 38-25 triumph over the Falcons, Adams was the revelation.
 As coach Pete Carroll said afterward, “Defensively, you couldn't help but watch Jamal Adams. I mean, he’s all over the place.”

SALEM, Ore. -- Diminishing winds and rising humidity helped firefighters battling deadly blazes in Oregon and California, but with dozens of people still missing, authorities in both states feared that the receding flames could reveal many more dead across the blackened landscape.
 Oregon's emergency management director said officials were preparing for a possible "mass fatality event."
 In California, smoke that painted skies orange also helped crews corral the state's deadliest blaze of the year. The smoke helped blocked the sun, reducing temperatures and raising humidity, officials said.
 Nine people, including a 16-year-old boy, have been confirmed dead in California since lightning-caused fires that started weeks ago fused into a monster blaze that largely destroyed Berry Creek, a tiny hamlet in the Sierra Nevada foothills northeast of San Francisco.
 Oregon authorities have not released an exact death count, but at least eight fatalities were reported from the blazes that have taken a toll from one end of the state to the other. Gov. Kate Brown said Friday that tens of thousands of people had been forced to flee their homes.
 Two large blazes threatened to merge near the most populated part of Oregon, including the suburbs of Portland.
 More than 40,000 Oregonians have been evacuated and about 500,000 are in different levels of evacuation zones, having been told to leave or to prepare to do so, Brown said. The governor dialed back a statement late Thursday by the state Office of Emergency Management that said a half-million people had been ordered to evacuate statewide.
 Scores of people were missing in Jackson County in the southern area of the state and in Marion County east of Salem, the state capital, Brown told a news conference. Authorities also announced that a man had been arrested on two counts of arson in connection with a fire in southern Oregon.
 Searchers found two victims of the so-called Beachie Creek fire near Salem. A 1-year-old boy was killed in wildfires in Washington, authorities said.
 Improved weather helped efforts on the ground after days of high winds, heat and low humidity. "The wind laid down quite a bit for us yesterday," said Stefan Myers of the state's fire information team.
 Almost 500 firefighters were working on the fires near Portland, which were just a few miles apart. The rugged terrain between them limited efforts to contain the flames, Myers said. If the fires merge, they could generate enough heat to send embers thousands of feet into the air, potentially igniting other areas.
 More than 1,500 square miles have burned in Oregon during recent days, nearly double the size of a typical year and an area larger than Rhode Island, authorities said.
 The land burned in just the past five days amounted to the state's second- worst fire season, after 2015, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee noted. He called the blazes "climate fires" rather than wildfires.
 "This is not an act of God," Inslee said. "This has happened because we have changed the climate."
 Jackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler said a 41-year-old man was jailed on two charges of arson for a fire that started Tuesday in the Phoenix area in southern Oregon. The fire that burned hundreds of homes had an ignition point in Ashland, near a spot where a man was found dead. Authorities said the man denied starting the fire.
 Officials were working to locate about 50 missing people, Sickler said.
 California crews made progress Friday in chopping or bulldozing brush-free lines to control the North Complex fire. Gusting winds that whipped up the flames days earlier eased while smoke blocked out the sun and lowered previously scorching temperatures. Saturday's high temperature was expected to top out at 80 degrees or less.
 Nearly 15,000 firefighters were battling 28 major wildfires across California, although 24 were sparked Thursday and quickly contained.
 The North Complex remained the deadliest this year. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea had said 10 bodies were found but on Friday lowered the figure. Remains found in a burned storage shed turned out to be from a resin model of a human skeleton that was used by an anthropology student, he said.
 A search continued for 19 missing people.
 Back in Oregon, evacuation centers were open across the state.
 Kim Carbaugh fled her home Monday in Lyons with her husband, two children and two horses.
 "When we were driving away and I could see actual fire, the red and orange flames, at the time I didn't feel scared, I had so much adrenaline -- we just had to leave," she said Friday from the livestock stables of an evacuation center at the state fairgrounds in Salem.
 The site also housed hundreds of animals -- dogs, llamas, horses, pigs, cows and chickens. Many people chose to camp or stay in RVs.

 "He's OK," Legg said. "He's not eating as normal. He knows something is going on."

He said: "The college does not want to see general practice become a totally, or even mostly, remote service post-pandemic.


  "However, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. We need to consider infection control and limit footfall in GP surgeries - all in line with NHS England's current guidance."


  He said most patients had understood the changes and that clinical commissioning groups had been asked to work with GP practices where face-to- face appointments were not possible - for example, if all GPs were at a high risk from coronavirus.


  "Any implication that they have not been doing their job properly is an insult to GPs and their teams who have worked throughout the pandemic, continued delivering the vast majority of patient care in the NHS and face an incredibly difficult winter ahead," he said.


  Research from the college indicated that routine GP appointments were back to near-normal levels for this time of year, after decreasing at the height of the pandemic.


  "Each and every day last week an estimated third of a million appointments were delivered face to face by general practices across the country," added Prof Marshall.

Michael Armstrong, chairman and CEO of AT&T, said TCG   'will become the foundation for a new unit with accountability for our local   services.'


  Robert Annunziata, chairman and CEO of TCG, will become an   executive of AT&T, reporting directly to Armstrong.


  The TCG merger will immediately transform AT&T into a   facilities-based carrier, thereby allowing it to circumvent an Eighth Circuit Court of   Appeals ruling last year that benefited such entrants into the local loop, but that left   the long-distance carriers out in the cold.


  Analysts have been expecting a blockbuster announcement   from AT&T, which has lagged behind its competitors in formulating a strategy for   getting into the local loop.


  The need for a strategy was given added impetus in   November, when WorldCom Inc. announced that it was acquiring MCI Communications Corp. --   which was already in 25 local markets.


  Analysts believe that the TCG deal, along with any   agreements with TCI, will meet with little opposition from federal regulators, who are   expected to approve the WorldCom/MCI deal.


  AT&T, which still has the world's most recognized   brand name, may be picking the ideal time to get back into the local loop.


  The effects of the TCG deal on cable's future role in   telephony depend on the current status of each cable operator.


  Cox said it will 'stay the course' in its drive   to become a full-blown CLEC (competitive local-exchange carrier), while analysts said TCI   and Comcast are more likely to act as distributors of AT&T local-exchange service.


  'We're not all in lockstep,' conceded Cox   vice president of public affairs David Andersen. Andersen said the TCG deal will have   little effect on Cox's plans.


  Cox is already providing switched telephone service in its   Orange County, Calif., and Omaha, Neb., markets, with plans to roll out service in its   seven remaining major clusters, he said.


  'What Teleport did for us was give us lines and   switches in areas where we didn't have them,' Andersen said. 'It also gave   us a nice return on our original investment of $207 million, which is now $2.4   billion.'


  One industry watcher, speaking on condition of anonymity,   said Hindery was discouraging talk of future deals with AT&T because of TCI's   history of not delivering on its promises.


  'TCI has stepped on itself repeatedly by promising   things that didn't come to fruition,' he said. 'Leo doesn't want to   announce anything until the fat lady sings.'


  AT&T will use TCG to gain immediate access to the   CAP's top 66 markets, 9,000-plus fiber route miles, 41 local switches, 5,000   connected buildings and 300,000 access lines of service, Armstrong said.


  'Cable will expand AT&T's reach beyond   TCG's commercial accounts to the residential markets,' said one financial   analyst, who asked not to be identified.


  Meanwhile, one analyst asked what the TCG deal would do to   the Sprint PCS partnership, which includes the same cable operators that controlled TCG.   Most likely, he said, the partners are preparing to jettison that investment.


  'You can kiss that partnership goodbye,' he said.   'They were suppose to market Sprint long-distance service. But Cox cut a deal to   offer long distance in California with another carrier. That was the first sign of   dissension in that partnership.'

When Lanto Griffin, 32, and Maya Brown, 28, of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, suddenly found their careers on pause this spring, Troy, their new shar-pei- lab rescue, helped them weather the downswing. (Research suggests that dogs can affect one’s physical and emotional well-being, from cardiovascular health to happiness.) Brown lost her job as an attorney and Griffin, a professional golfer, was idle when the PGA Tour temporarily suspended its season.
 “When you’re used to being on the road almost every week and all of a sudden you’re home for three months, Troy helped get my mind off everything that was going on,” Griffin said.
 Golf has resumed and, although dogs are not allowed at tournaments, Troy has driven with the couple around the Eastern United States, with stops in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; and elsewhere.

 “Troy has a pretty bad case of FOMO” — fear of missing out — “and he has to be right beside us so he can know what’s going on,” Brown said.

INTERFERENCE


  Defensive pass interference penalties had a considerable effect on the game. The Saints were flagged four times for 101 yards, with all of those calls occurring during the Bucs’ first three scoring drives. A 33-yard interference penalty against Tampa Bay at its own 6-yard line set up Kamara’s second touchdown of the game. Officials called defensive pass interference six times for 149 yards on both teams combined.

Denver -- Divicom Inc. is set to take the wraps off a new   digital video encoder today, targeted to optimize transmission bandwidth for broadcast,   satellite and cable operators.
 The new MediaView MV40 encoder, based on MPEG-2 DV silicon   from Divicom's parent, C-Cube Microsystems Inc., includes a 'look-ahead'   capability that distinguishes it from other video encoders, said executives during a   briefing here Feb. 13.
 Tom Lookabaugh, president of Divicom, said the new feature   means that potential customers 'can save money by increasing the efficiency of their   transmission bandwidth and increasing their revenue streams by offering more channels of   programming over the same amount of bandwidth.'
 The 'look-ahead' technology works by harnessing   the power of two complete encoding chips, one of which keeps looking at the complexity of   incoming content so that it can predict exactly how much bandwidth will be needed, said   Ben Stanger, marketing manager of Divicom. The second chip actually encodes the material.
 'Other encoders work by reacting to digitized content   and taking more of an averaged approach to bandwidth prediction,' he said. 'This   way, you optimize and manage available bandwidth by tracking it precisely.'
 Stanger said analog or digital content enters the encoder,   it is processed by an adaptive field-frame decoder and it then moves through an adaptive   preprocessor and noise reducer.
 After that, about 16 frames of video at a time flow into a   buffer, so that the first encoding chip can 'look ahead' and determine the   required bit rate. The second encoding chip then performs the actual encoding, with the   appropriate bit rates, and the content is then passed off to a transport- stream-formatting   and control chip before exiting the encoder.
 The MV40 encoder is designed to work with Divicom's   'MediaNode' statistical multiplexer, so that up to 32 encoded bit streams can be   placed together.
 Users of the encoder can specify minimum and maximum bit   rates, from 700 kilobits per second up to 8 megabits per second, Stanger said.
 The encoder will be commercially available early next   month, at prices ranging from $55,000 to $70,000, executives said.

If anyone in the industry forgot that this is an electionyear, last week's 'Annual Competition Report' from the Federal Communications Commissionis an unpleasant reminder of the politics at play.


  Last week the FCC delivered its fourth report on the stateof competition of video programming to Congress, a body that in 1992 froze cable rateincreases with the passage of its Draconian 1992 Cable Act.


  Blithely ignoring many facts within its own report, the FCCdeclared that there was not widespread competition to the cable industry and something hadto be done about it and cable's rising rates.


  For example, the FCC duly reported that high-power DBSsubscribership grew 46 percent, while cable grew about 2 percent. That's not competition?


  Tele-Communications Inc. president Leo J. Hindrey Jr.joked, 'I couldn't disagree more. I am the only person in the world who knows how to losesubscribers to the competition.'


  The FCC said that as a result of that lack of competition,cable operators had rammed through an average 8.5 percent rate increase on the Americanpublic.


  It's odd, as Steve Effros, president of CATA, noted, thatat the very same time the FCC was bellyaching that cable's rate increases were well abovethe Consumer Price Index of 2 percent, that the National Football League pushed through ahike that was 50 times the rate of inflation.


  And ESPN's $4.4 billion bid for the cable chunk of the NFLpackage was 135 percent higher than the last NFL cable package price.


  Furthermore, the FCC said that because competition to cableis not imminent, it was necessary for the agency to do something about that before thesunset of cable rate regulation goes into effect March 31, 1999.


  Many industry executives were surprised at the harshnesswith which FCC chairman William E. Kennard attacked the industry last week, although theywere relieved to hear that he was not talking about a rate freeze, especially because ofthe volatility of an election year where several elected officials have already beenmaking noises about cable rate hikes.


  'When confronted with allegations of price gauging, cableoperators reflexively point to additional programming costs,' Kennard charged, whileacknowledging that the commission's 'own rules and policies may be a source of thisproblem.'


  So having said that, Kennard has now directed the CableServices Bureau to begin an inquiry into programming costs, looking for the sources ofthose increasees, the variance in costs among various distributors and to find out ifexisting relationships among vertically integrated companies that have programmingservices and own cable systems may be impacting the prices charged.


  'This inquiry will require the cooperation andforthrightness of the industry,' Kennard added.


  Last week many cable operators said that they would welcomethat conversation with the FCC, especially after the agency had explored the ramificationsof the NFL contract, and the anticipated rate increases from ESPN, which is own by Disney-- which is not a vertically integrated company with cable system holdings.


  But why should any cable operator or programmer allowhimself to be subjected to such intrusive regulatory steps and encourage governmentmicromanagement, less innovation and investment, as Decker Anstrom, president of theNational Cable Televesion Assocation asked.


  Unfortunately, when you cut through all the rhetoric, whatthe FCC and Congress really wants is lower cable rates and not the 'unreasonable rates,'as mandated by law, said CATA's Effros.


  So who is to judge what is a reasonable rate increase?Effros argues that the CPI is not an appropriate yardstick and we agree.


  The Simon Legrees of corporate America learned that quicklyin an era of low unemployment, when they tryed to justify paltry 3 percent salaryincreases and as a result saw their best employees, particularly in highly competitiveindustries, move to greener and more lucrative pastures.


  Where all this goes with the Cable Service Bureau's newmandate is anyone's guess.


  But at least one industry executive was worried that theFCC would recommend extending the sunset on cable rate regulation beyond 1999. Were thatto happen the outcome would be devastating.


  Kennard, a proponent of digital television, would seecable's investment and innovation dry up before his eyes.

There is ample reason for concern. Coronavirus outbreaks — like one in East Lansing, Michigan, this summer that infected 187 people — have been traced to superspreading gatherings at bars and restaurants. And a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that one difference between people who contracted the virus and those who did not is that infected individuals were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant in the two weeks preceding their illness. The study, however, did not distinguish between outdoor dining and indoor seating, which most experts consider more hazardous.
 But while health officials have endorsed masks and social distancing as effective measures for curbing the spread of the coronavirus, some experts scoff at fever checks. Taking temperatures at entry points is nothing more than theater, they say, a gesture that is unlikely to screen out many infected individuals, and one that offers little more than the illusion of safety.
 Cuomo has allowed businesses to demand that patrons undergo temperature checks and to deny admission to those who refuse or have a fever, and he is requiring restaurants in New York City that resume indoor dining to check customers’ temperatures. The CDC defines a fever as a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher; some reports have questioned the accuracy of thermometer guns, however.
 While temperature checks may identify people who are seriously ill, those are the people who probably won’t be socializing much or going out for meals. And a growing body of evidence suggests that many of those who are driving transmission are so-called silent carriers — people who have been infected but feel fine and don’t have a fever or any other symptoms.
 Last week, the CDC — which in May told employers to consider checking workers daily for symptoms like fever but appeared to reverse itself in July — said it would stop requiring airport health screenings beginning Sept. 14 for international passengers from China, Iran, Brazil and other countries because the checks can’t identify silent carriers.
 “We now have a better understanding of COVID-19 transmission that indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms,” the CDC said in a statement.
 Temperature checks are akin to “getting the oil checked before you go on a long car trip,” said Dr. David Thomas, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "It makes you feel better, but it’s not going to keep you from wrecking the car or prevent the tires from falling off. It’s not going to make your trip any safer.
 “It’s something you can do, and it makes you feel like you’re doing something,” he said. “But it won’t catch most people who are spreading COVID.”
 Most people who spike a fever feel lousy and presumably would cancel their dinner plans, said Dr. Thomas McGinn, Northwell Health’s senior vice president and deputy physician in chief. Temperature checks might pick up a few individuals who are unaware of their fever, he said.
 But the absence of fever “means nothing,” he said. “It’s not a very sensitive test.”
 It does, however, convey a strong public health message, serving as a reminder that people must take precautions, and that itself may be of benefit, McGinn said. “It makes people think twice and reminds them that this is a big deal, we still need to be careful, you need someone to stand by the door to do that,” he said.
 But here’s the rub: While fever can be a symptom of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, not everyone infected with the virus develops a fever — or many other symptoms, for that matter. Physicians writing in the New England Journal of Medicine have called the phenomenon of symptomless spread the “Achilles’ heel of COVID-19 pandemic control.”

Trump, however, had a louder megaphone than his health experts, and in public he was playing down the threat. Three days after delivering his “deadly” assessment in a private call with journalist Bob Woodward, he told a New Hampshire rally on Feb. 10, “It’s going to be fine.”
 Trump’s acknowledgment in Woodward’s new book “Rage” that he was minimizing the severity of the virus in public to avoid causing panic has triggered waves of criticism that he wasn’t leveling with the American people.
 The White House has tried to answer that criticism by pointing to selected comments from U.S. health experts to suggest they were on the same page with Trump all along.
 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany highlighted comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, to try to make the case that Trump didn’t lie to the public. She cited a Feb. 17 interview in which Fauci focused his concern on the seasonal flu then playing out.
 But a day later, Fauci had spoken of alarming potential implications from the new virus, saying, “Not only do we not have an appreciation of the magnitude, even more disturbing is that we don’t have an appreciation of where the magnitude is going.”
 Mixed safety messages added to confusion. There was considerable discussion about mask-wearing in the early days of the pandemic, with leading experts advising the public against it, saying to leave the masks for health care workers.
 “Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted on Feb. 29. Officials later recommended that people wear face coverings in public and around people who don’t live in their household, based on a review of the latest evidence.
 People could find different takeaways within Fauci’s pronouncements. He told the USA Today editorial board on Feb. 17 that the CDC would be testing people for the coronavirus in five major cities when they showed up at clinics with flu-like symptoms.

Fall can be a dangerous time to be a farmer.
 With corn silage harvest already weeks underway in parts of the state and other parts of the fall harvest rapidly nearing, more and more hazardous situations are liable to pop up.
 From perhaps relatively minor slips and falls while getting on or off equipment to often seriously dangerous roadway collisions or tractor rollovers, farm-related injuries can cost operators time, money or, in worst- case scenarios, even their lives.
 And these farm accidents are by no means an uncommon occurrence.
 “I don’t know of a farm family that doesn’t have some kind of story of injury,” said Shelly Mayer, a dairy farmer and executive director of the Professional Dairy Producers of Wisconsin.
 Mayer relayed her own family’s farm accident story during the Sept. 9 PDPW Dairy Signal webinar, talking about an accident she remembered from her childhood of seeing her father come into the house with a missing index finger — able to be reattached — and two other injured fingers after an incident while working with a blower during chopping season. Mayer helped her father wrap dish towels around the injury before helping him get to her mother out in the field, who took her father to the hospital for care.
 While Mayer’s father’s case was “just a matter of some digits,” the recovery was still a long process, she said.
 One in five Midwestern farms will have injury in 2020, said John Shutske, professor, agricultural health and safety specialist and director of the UW Center for Agricultural Safety & Health. Of those injuries, 80% will require medical care.
 The bad news statistics don’t stop there.
 Farmers also have a workplace death rate of 22 per 100,000, a rate that is seven times higher than that for general industry, Shutske said during the Sept. 9 webinar.
 While they may be jarring, statistics aren’t the whole story either, though.
 “This is not just about data or statistics or numbers,” Shutske said. “We’re talking about people.”
 Implementing key safety steps on the farm can help protect those people, both on and off the farm.
 Roadway collisions, which are becoming quite prevalent, Shutske said, are one of few ag safety items that is also a public safety issue.
 Farmers can do their part to help avoid these generally “catastrophic” collisions by making themselves as visible as possible and when possible, avoiding or minimizing being on roadways in low-light situations, Shutske said.
 “It’s almost impossible to light yourself up too much,” he said.
 Farmers are advised to check with their state department of transportation for minimum requirements, as well as be aware of any applicable national requirements, especially as they apply to newer machinery.
 Tractor rollovers are another major farm safety issue and rank high on the list of causes of death for farmers, Shutske said.
 Most at risk for rollovers are older machines, those with narrow front ends and those with a bucket loader or other high center or gravity, Shutske said.
 Experienced drivers are also at higher risk when it comes to rollovers, Shutske said, noting that the “experienced” descriptor was not a typo and suggesting that complacency or a slower reaction time could be responsible.
 Limiting exposure on pre-rollover-protection-structure machinery, using care when loading onto a trailer, retrofitting older equipment with ROPS when possible and considering a myriad of factors when determining the level of risk when driving on a slope can help prevent deaths, Shutske said.
 Equipment fires can also prove to be dangerous, especially in the midst of chopping and combining.
 Shutske recommended that farmers go into the engine compartments, where most fires start, of their equipment, especially choppers and combines, daily to clear out any material that may have accumulated and to remedy any fluid leaks before doing anything else. He also recommended that equipment have not one but two ABC dry chemical fire extinguishers, weighing at least 10 pounds, on hand.
 Not every farm accident is as “dramatic” as roadway collisions or rollovers, but even so, they can still cause a considerable amount of difficulty for farmers to deal with, Shutske said.
 Injuries resulting from fatigue, mounting or dismounting equipment, lack of training or mistaken assumptions can also happen quickly and result in potentially life-long consequences, whether they’re financial, physical or otherwise, he said.
 Taking breaks; making equipment modifications, such as extra step, when needed for stability; and creating open lines of communication are ways to decrease those kinds of risks.
 Among the best steps farmers can take right now as harvest season gets underway is to do a walk-through with anyone who is going to be using equipment on the farm to make sure everything is safe and everyone is clear on their responsibilities, Shutske said.
 Still, while taking steps to prevent mishaps on the farm can go a long way toward decreasing the likelihood of one occurring, farmers will continue to be faced with the fact that not every accident is going to be 100% preventable.
 “Things do happen,” Shutske said.
 National Farm Safety & Health Week is Sept. 20-26, following the theme "Every Farmer Counts." For more information on ag safety in Wisconsin, visit fyi.extension.wisc.edu/agsafety. Shutske can also be reached with questions at shutske@wisc.edu.

The Colts may find they have a QB controversy on their hands sooner rather than later. Philip Rivers has been a turnover machine for years, specializing in the first quarter and fourth quarter variety, which is why the Chargers were ready to move on by last December. The Colts should have put the Jags away early, scoring a quick TD, getting stuffed on downs near the goal line and then, driving again, Rivers got picked, which led to the Jags' first score. And, trailing by a score with less than five minutes left, Rivers got picked again. Defenders can undercut his throws too easily, as arm strength has long seemed an issue. But he is still pretty quick to heave the ball up for grabs. Head coach Frank Reich goes way back with him, and with his $25M salary I doubt we see a quick hook. But Jacoby Brissett is the better QB and he is already seeing the field in certain packages and that could prove to be a damning loss for Indy …

Upon his arrival in Seattle, Adams remarked that joining Wagner on the Seahawks’ defense was like “a cheat code.” On Sunday, Adams compared the pairing to Batman and Robin. Either way, it's a combination that few teams can match.
 “But it’s even just Bobby, man,’’ he added. “Just so many guys out there. The whole defense was flying around the ball. Talking noise, just having fun. We had a lot of mistakes, but at the end of the day, we were creating stops and trying to create turnovers, so that’s what it’s about.”
 Since his arrival, Adams has been eager to make clear, whenever asked (and even when he’s not), how content he is to be in Seattle. It cost the Seahawks two first-round draft picks to acquire him from the Jets, to the disapproval of many, and will cost them immensely in cash when it’s time for a new contract after the season.
 But when you have a dynamic talent who is fully comfortable in his surroundings with a life-changing contract to play for, it can be a recipe for great things. The Seahawks have needed a jolt, and Adams looks equipped to give it to them. And speaking of jolts, count him among those marveling at Wilson’s nearly flawless performance.
 “For Russ to go out there and do what he did and what he's always done, I'm just happy to be a part of this organization, man,’’ he said. “These guys are telling me they're happy I'm here, but I'm really happy _I 'm_ here, man.

With the passage of the Cable Act of 1992, Congress   embraced a vision for the future that would bring competition to the cable- television   industry.
 But several weeks ago, the Federal Communications   Commission released its study on competition, which reported that progress on this front   has been slow. Meanwhile, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are talking about delaying the   scheduled termination of expanded-basic cable-rate regulations in March 1999.
 In this context, are cable operators having much success   convincing subscribers and the cities that the rate increases are necessary? In this tale   of three cities where operators raised rates last year, the results are mixed.
 Even as MediaOne is seeking to back out of its agreement to   sell its St. Paul, Minn., system to Charter Communications Inc., that action has generated   as little interest as MediaOne did when it raised its equipment rates last summer.
 MediaOne currently offers a $35.92-per-month standard   service to its 52,000 St. Paul subscribers, part of a Twin Cities-area customer base of   about 300,000.
 'I don't know that cable is a real hot consumer   issue in St. Paul,' said Holly Hansen, the city's cable communications officer.   'We haven't had huge rate issues here. We have had a couple of complaints with   the equipment hikes. I don't think [that customers] care, as long as they get good   service that's reasonable and courteous people on the phone. I don't think that   the city cares, provided that we get good quality and good service.'
 Hansen said the city's arms are tied because of the   so-called social contract that MediaOne's predecessor, Continental Cablevision Inc.,   signed with the FCC. Only the FCC can review certain rates, and that agency is so backed   up, she said, that 'they haven't reviewed last year's rate hike, let alone   this year's.'
 Although Continental refused to give up the financial   information that the city had requested, Hansen said, 'Our frustration is with the   FCC' and its backlog.
 'We're prohibited by the social contract from   [reviewing rates], so nobody does it. That, to me, is not a good solution,' she said.
 The bigger hurdle in the franchise-renewal process is the   disposition of a franchise-required institutional network, which currently provides about   70 schools and 30 other institutions with a closed loop for data and video transmissions.
 In Minneapolis, the operator is different, and the   situation is far from identical. Paragon Communications, a Time Warner Cable company,   serves about 190,000 customers in Minneapolis and its environs. Its rates have increased   about 45 percent since January 1996, with standard service now priced at $35.45.
 But the increasing rates have not soured Paragon's   relations with its subscribers, perhaps because the company coupled the increase with new   services and a system upgrade. Paragon's former 'Added Value Package' --   which included ESPN2, The History Channel, Turner Classic Movies and Cartoon Network, and   which sold for an additional $1.95 per month -- is now part of its standard service. The   operator has just completed a plant upgrade to 750 megahertz in five southwestern suburbs,   and it is proposing similar upgrades in its discussions with other franchising   authorities. said Kim Roden, Paragon's vice president of public affairs.
 'We feel more comfortable making the size of   investment for upgrades because there's some recognition that we can be competitive   with others,' Roden said.
 Most of the cities recognize that if they want   state-of-the-art cable technology, there's a price that has to be paid.
 'They want to maintain the goose that's laying   the golden egg,' Roden said about cable's payment of franchise fees.
 One factor in the relatively amicable relations is the   presence of what Paragon calls viable competitors. Although the local-exchange provider   does not offer video service, wireless cable and direct-broadcast satellite are legitimate   competitors in the area, the cable company insisted.
 As of December, Roden estimated that competitors have   plucked off 20,000 customers in the Minneapolis market. She said the company has seen an   increase in its percentage of basic-service-only customers -- a possible indication that a   growing number of full-service subscribers are switching to DBS and maintaining basic   cable only.
 All of this has helped Paragon to persuade its communities   to retreat from onerous franchise requirements -- which have included 30 public-access   channels, 120 customer channels and studio equipment and a $275,000 annual fee for public   access -- and to work as partners for a competitive future.
 Such is the case in the five southwestern suburbs -- Edina,   Eden Prairie, Hopkins, Richfield and Minnetonka -- encompassing 60,000 customers, where a   joint cable commission and Paragon hammered out a new, 15-year franchise agreement last   year.
 In exchange for a system upgrade, the communities will   allow Paragon to consolidate all public-access operations in a single facility in Eden   Prairie, to dramatically reduce its annual fee for public access and to turn over   operation of a public-access van to the communities.
 The agreement also contains a most-favored-nation clause:   If a franchise with another provider doesn't require it, Paragon won't have to   do it.
 Adrian Herbst of law firm Fredrikson & Byron, who   serves as franchise administrator, noted that the commission agreed to the new franchise   only after studying Paragon's proposal at length.
 Herbst praised Paragon for its cooperation and willingness   to rebuild the system 'at an early date.' He said relations between Paragon and   the cities are good.
 'People do have concerns about rates. You're   always going to have people react to a rate change. For the most part, the amount of   complaints is very little, and the cable company is very willing to discuss these things   with the cable commission,' Herbst said.
 While regulators in the Minneapolis area are marching with   their operator to the drums of a competitive future, in Providence, R.I., John A. Notte   III is listening to music of another kind -- the cacophony of customer complaints about a   rate hike that Cox Communications Inc. pushed through last year.
 Cox implemented its rate changes -- which raised the   expanded-basic rate by nearly 5 percent, to $27.91 per month -- in November. Reaction may   have been intensified by simultaneous changes in channel lineups and the relocation of   broadcasters 'on channel' -- activities that, whatever their ultimate benefit to   customers, tend to generate confusion.
 'It's ruffled a lot of subscribers'   feathers,' said Notte, whose formal title is associate administrator of the Division   of Public Utilities. He said he will file a complaint with the FCC on the increase.
 Part of the confusion may stem from the multiplicity of   systems and channel lineups in the state. While Cox is the dominant provider, serving 92   percent of the state, it operates five separate channel lineups for systems with varying   capabilities.
 In Cranston, where Cox is rebuilding the plant to 750 MHz,   it introduced an expanded channel lineup. In northern and southern systems acquired by Cox   from Tele-Communications Inc., it offered no new channels at the time.
 'I think that it's important to put this in   context,' said John Wolfe, Cox's vice president of government and public affairs   for New England. 'It used to be that when a Rhode Island cable operator changed   prices, it would affect a small area, because there were seven or eight operators. Now,   because we have 92 percent of the state, you're going to see significantly higher   [complaint] volume, because more people are affected on the same day.'
 To minimize confusion about the multiplicity of rates and   channel lineups, Cox 'used just about every communications vehicle,' Wolfe said,   including newspaper articles, local television, on-air spots, infomercials and   'transactional messages.'
 In Minneapolis, active and effective competition is serving   as a catalyst for cooperation between the regulators and the regulated. In Providence, the   competitive threat appears much further down the road.
 The local-exchange provider, Bell Atlantic Corp., has no   immediate plans for video delivery, while DBS providers, according to Notte, have made   what appear to be modest inroads.
 'I don't see any great exodus at this   stage,' Notte said about cable subscribers to DBS.
 Cox's Rhode Island customer total grew by about 3.6   percent, to 264,665, over the first three quarters of 1997. However, Notte did not   interpret this as a measure of customer satisfaction or of the effectiveness of the Cable   Act of 1992.
 'You have groups screaming for a freeze or a   moratorium on rates, and you've got a congressman who introduced a bill to do   that,' Notte said. 'I'm assuming that they're getting the same kind of   reactions across the country. You may see some action on that. Our U.S. congressman,   [Sen.] Jack Reed [D-R.I.], is in touch with us a couple times a week.'

The wireless-broadband sector last week remained a study in   contrasts, with the LMDS auction getting off to a tepid start amid a surge in vendor   support for the new technology that included Lucent Technologies Inc.


  All but a handful of the major telecommunications players   passed on a chance to acquire licenses to the biggest block of spectrum ever offered by   the Federal Communications Commission. It was clear that the growing enthusiasm for the   potential of wireless broadband among vendors had not convinced most operating companies   that they could peg their future in local broadband communications to LMDS (local   multipoint distribution service).


  Instead, after the first day's first round of bidding,   the overwhelming leader -- with $135.8 million bid on about 110 million 'POPs'   (units of population) -- was a nonoperating entity backed by major venture- capital firms   and former Providence Journal Co. president and chief operating officer Trygve Myrhen,   known as WNP Communications Inc.


  U S West Communications -- one of two Baby Bells in the   running, along with SBC Communications Inc. -- was a distant second, with $7.9 million bid   on the 150-megahertz B-block spectrum, covering about 35 million POPs. SBC wasn't in   the top 10.


  In all, the first round drew bids of $192.6 million, 89   percent of which went for the 1.15-gigahertz A-block segments. Continuing uncertainty   about the new technology was reflected in Comcast Corp.'s last-minute decision to   pass on the bidding after having initially filed as a potential participant.


  'After looking further at the options, we were all   pretty well convinced that the technical capabilities were still to be determined,'   said Joe Waz, vice president of external affairs and public-policy counsel at Comcast.


  While it's still early, it was clear that the bidding   had a long way to go if it was to live up to various projections suggesting that the   spectrum was worth as much as $4 billion.


  For example, WNP was the top bidder for the 1.15-GHz   A-block in the top eight BTAs (basic trading areas), offering $1.23 per POP. But the   company with the most high bids -- Teligent LLC affiliate AUCO Inc. -- was first in 74   markets with total bids of only $2.9 million, representing only seven cents per POP.


  While such numbers may not bode well for a big government   take, they don't necessarily spell trouble for LMDS, said Dan Ernst, analyst with The   Strategis Group. That company has been bullish on LMDS, with projections suggesting that   the sector could generate annual revenues of $7 billion by 2007, with cumulative capital   spending by that time of about $8 billion.


  A press release issued by Strategis in October said total   bids for the 493 BTAs 'should bring in over $4 billion,' with dense urban   markets going for as much as $25 to $30 per POP. But Ernst insisted that the   company's research had only suggested that the value of the spectrum was $4 billion,   and not that $4 billion would be bid.


  'The real success of LMDS will depend on whether the   markets get built out,' Ernst said. 'The less that's paid for spectrum, the   higher the probability is that this will happen.'


  Moreover, Ernst noted, the real state of affairs won't   be clear until about two months after the auctions are completed and the winners begin to   form partnerships. Also, he said, it would take a while to determine the true ownership of   some participants, which could well turn out to be shell companies with major backing from   large telecommunications players.


  This possibility was on the mind of FCC chairman William   Kennard. FCC rules bar local-exchange carriers and cable companies from holding more than   20 percent interest in A-block spectrum in their territories. But he's afraid that   those companies will find loopholes in the FCC's rules to wield power over how LMDS   licensees use the spectrum.


  'If, for example, an incumbent [operator] holds 20   percent-ownership interest and, in exchange for financing an LMDS venture, it also holds   options to acquire additional equity of up to 80 percent more, the investor's ability   to affect the competitive nature of the venture would not be significantly different than   if it had direct control,' Kennard said.


  A United States Telephone Association spokesman said the   group was leaning against appealing a federal appeals court decision upholding the ban.


  But Mary McDermott, the USTA's vice president of legal   and regulatory affairs, noted that the group had circulated a letter among key members of   Congress in hopes of generating support for its position that those restrictions are not   consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996.


  'We're resigned to the fact that where LMDS is   concerned, we're really out of it,' McDermott said. 'Our goal now is to   prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.'


  The emergence of Lucent as a system supplier in LMDS and   other wireless-broadband segments should help to ensure that LMDS systems will get built,   with or without big telecommunications players, Ernst said, noting that such suppliers   traditionally have supplied financing to their customers.


  Gary Bonhan, a spokesman for Lucent, said such financing   was a possibility, depending on 'the particular situation.'


  Lucent said it had agreed to acquire the LMDS wireless   business of Hewlett-Packard Co., and that it would launch a new   wireless-broadband-networks division in Milpitas, Calif.


  'We're not ready to announce a product at this   point, but we expect to be able to meet market needs as they develop this year and   beyond,' Bonhan said.


  Other vendors that have shown enthusiasm for wireless   broadband include Nortel, Ericsson Inc., Siemens Telecom Inc. and Bosch Telecom Inc.


  Nortel, which recently acquired wireless-broadband   technology supplier Broadband Networks Inc., has taken an early lead in the market as the   end-to-end supplier for many of Teligent's 700 markets, in a deal valued at $700   million.


  Sources said Teligent was seeking a second major supplier,   which was said to be a factor in Lucent's decision to jump into the market.


  Also joining the supplier lineup last week was Ericsson,   which said that it decided to develop its own system, rather than acquiring someone   else's. Like the other suppliers, Ericsson said it was tapping the big breakthrough   in monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit radio design of the past two years that has   allowed developers to make very small solid-state transmitter/receivers for use in   transmitting interactive broadband signals on a point-to-multipoint basis over distances   of two to three miles.


  Lucent -- also using the MMIC technology and, like many   others, relying on over-the-air adaptations of ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) as the   transport-and-access method -- will be able to quickly integrate the radio- access   technology into its other transport-and-switching components, Bonhan said.


  'There's nothing that has to be invented here to   allow our customers to make use of all of the equipment that you need to build a complete   network,' he said.


  Some smaller vendors were joining the field, as well,   including radar-systems supplier BEL-Tronics Ltd. of Mississauga, Ontario, and   PCS-wireless-systems (personal communications services) company Wytec Inc. of Santa Clara,   Calif. BEL-Tronics, which has been acquired by San Diego-based investment firm Akcess   Pacific Group, believes that it has found a way to deliver lower-cost transceivers than   other suppliers, said Drew Smith, a consultant to the company, who declined to go into   details.


  Wytec, unlike most suppliers, is focusing its initial   product on one-way delivery of video services, while offering a migration path to two-way   later on, said Margarate Ralston, executive director for North American programs. The   company is also developing gear for other spectrum tiers all the way to 42 GHz, she said.

MARLBOROUGH -- The calmness and relaxation of casting a line into the waters at the Marlboro Fish & Game Association is quite a contrast from the battlefields on which many veterans have fought.
 But on Monday 20 Marlborough veterans will do just that, in hopes of reeling in a big fish during a morning of fishing and sharing stories at the Marlboro Fish & Game Association. Mike Hennessy, Marlborough director of Veterans Services, organized the morning of fishing and socially distanced fun to safely get city veterans active and together during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Hennessy said Jason Grimes at the Marlboro Fish & Game Association jumped at the idea of holding the event.
 "They have cabin fever," Hennessy said.
 Hennessy, an avid fisherman, said fishing is a socially distanced activity. If people do get too close while fishing, they can cross lines or even get hooked.
 "You can do it socially distanced," he said.
 The event, which is free to Marlborough veterans, will be limited to 20 participants. Eight spots remained as of Thursday morning, said Hennessy. Veterans can sign up by calling the city's Veterans Service office at 508-485-6492.
 The Marlboro Fish & Game Association will provide fishing poles and bait, and will teach veterans to fish.
 A light breakfast and lunch will be provided by the Fish & Game Association and the Italian Americans Veterans Club. A volunteer from Serv Safe will be on hand to ensure food is distributed safely.
 Hennessy has striven to gather city veterans together since he took over as director of Veterans Services in February, but said it has been challenging due to the pandemic. He hopes to hold more events in the future to create a stronger camaraderie among Marlborough's veterans.
 "That bond will never ever go away," Hennessy said of the brotherhood and sisterhood of veterans.
 With several major issues facing the country and world, Hennessy said a morning of fishing will be relaxing and healing for the veterans.
 "Why don't we forget about all that and fish, have fun and shoot the breeze," said Hennessy.
 The fishing outing will run from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Marlboro Fish & Game Association at 1 Muddy Lane.

Most people who spike a fever feel lousy and presumably would cancel their dinner plans, said Dr. Thomas McGinn, Northwell Health’s senior vice president and deputy physician in chief. Temperature checks might pick up a few individuals who are unaware of their fever, he said.
 But the absence of fever “means nothing,” he said. “It’s not a very sensitive test.”
 It does, however, convey a strong public health message, serving as a reminder that people must take precautions, and that itself may be of benefit, McGinn said. “It makes people think twice and reminds them that this is a big deal, we still need to be careful, you need someone to stand by the door to do that,” he said.
 But here’s the rub: While fever can be a symptom of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, not everyone infected with the virus develops a fever — or many other symptoms, for that matter. Physicians writing in the New England Journal of Medicine have called the phenomenon of symptomless spread the “Achilles’ heel of COVID-19 pandemic control.”

There were no preseason games, so no one really knows what to expect out of the gate from these Giants — a young team with 27 new players and 16 new coaches. Teams now have 16-man practice squads instead of 10 and they can promote two of those players to the active roster on game days, effectively giving teams 48-man rosters at kickoff.
 The Giants also had personal offseason affairs, as starting left tackle Nate Solder, who has a 5-year-old son battling cancer, was one of 67 NFL players to opt out of the season because of coronavirus concerns. Meanwhile, cornerback DeAndre Baker and kicker Aldrick Rosas lost their spots on the team because of arrests that few could have seen coming.
 “We’re working to build a tough, smart, fundamentally sound football team,” Judge said Saturday of his message to Giants fans. “That’s where our emphasis is going to lie and that’s where we’re going to consistently work towards getting to. These guys have been working hard. There’s a lot of energy, there’s a lot of urgency in what we’re preparing to do, and we’re going to go out there and work to make the area proud.”
 I picked the Giants to go 6-10 when the schedule came out in May and see no reason to veer from that.
 In the long run, Judge has the potential to be a savvy, outside-the-box hire. It should be rewarding for the Giants to have a head coach who intends be a CEO on game day again as opposed to predecessors Pat Shurmur and Ben McAdoo, who had their faces stuffed in play sheets to call the offense and clearly weren’t cut out for the job.
 But the compromised offseason will probably hurt the Giants more than most teams. The inexperienced roster learned new schemes without a preseason, and there are sizable question marks at offensive line, linebacker and in the secondary.

Infomercials are here to stay as an advertising-revenue   source for cable networks and operators, but the future course of the business may find   these program-length commercials becoming more like entertainment programs than like   hard-sell spiels.
 While infomercials -- more formally known as   direct-response advertising -- have grown steadily as a presence on cable over the last   few years, programmers and operators offered differing visions of the next phase of their   relationship.
 Infomercial suppliers predicted a steady rise in the number   of hours and channels devoted to infomercials, thanks in part to the advent of digital   tiers. They also envisioned becoming closer partners with cable operators, with   revenue-sharing becoming a more common deal structure.
 But cable operators, while happy to sell off   'remnant' airtime that would otherwise go begging (especially during the early   morning hours), appeared hesitant to fully embrace the infomercial industry.
 Dan Gold, president of Century Communications Corp.'s   cable division, said he did not think that revenues from infomercials would become   'very much more prominent' in the next two years.
 Gold also said Century was in no rush to move away from   selling airtime to partnering with infomercial suppliers and taking a percentage of the   sale of individual products.
 'That's not a business that we particularly want   to be in,' Gold said.
 John Collins, general manager of Time Warner Direct, an   advertising division of Time Warner Cable, praised infomercial programmers for adding   revenue and 'delivering value' to cable systems, but he agreed with Gold that   Time Warner would rather structure a deal based on guaranteed revenue per subscriber than   on a percentage of the sale.
 'We don't want to be partners,' Collins   said. 'We're not in the infomercial-production business. And the upside [of   revenue-sharing] is negated by the downside.'
 Nor should infomercial producers count on digital channels   to provide a cornucopia of distribution for their products -- at least not yet.
 At MediaOne, for example, Ed Dunbar, the MSO's new   vice president of advertising sales, said infomercials will have to wait in line for   digital time. 'There are a lot of other things that we have to focus on before   [infomercials] become a key part of our strategy,' he pointed out.
 Operators are hardly turning their noses up at the   sometimes tacky, sometimes wacky world of psychic friends, abdominal flexors, skin-care   products and something-from-nothing real estate fortunes, however.
 NIMA International estimated that infomercials pumped   approximately $300 million into cable last year. GRTV, the cable subsidiary of infomercial   giant Guthy-Renker Television, alone spent $70 million on buying advertising time on   cable.
 'This is found money for cable, and a lot of it,'   said Ben Van De Bunt, executive vice president of Guthy-Renker. 'Cable fragments   media more and, therefore, it gives us a more direct opportunity to deal with our   customer. Cable's size of the [infomercial] pie is increasing, and we see business   growing 10 percent to 15 percent annually.'
 Elissa Myers, president of NIMA, called cable 'the key   driving force' propelling the growth of the infomercial industry.
 In particular, infomercials on local systems provide   'an ideal testing ground' for new products, Myers said. 'Local buys,'   she said, 'are affordable, and they can be very targeted.'
 In fact, Access Television Network -- a major infomercial   producer that employs celebrity pitch people such as Dick Clark, Victoria Principal and   Dionne Warwick -- estimated that local cable accounted for 25 percent of the   cable-infomercial business last year, up from only 5 percent in 1994.
 Access president Bill Bernard said business, fueled by   local growth, is 'wonderful,' pointing to an estimated $22 million in revenue   for the company for fiscal-year 1998, which concludes at the end of this month, up 37   percent from $16 million in 1997.
 In fact, the infomercial business is so appealing that for   the past year-and-a-half, Jones Intercable Inc., Cox Communications Inc. and Adelphia   Communications Corp. have been joint-venture partners in Product Information Network, a   leading cable-infomercial supplier and a dedicated infomercial channel with approximately   9 million subscribers.
 According to PIN chief operating officer Jon Shaver, the   network is on 24 hours per day in 60 percent of its homes, and demand from cable operators   is growing.
 Shaver contended that the infomercial business has turned a   corner with the demise of 'fly-by-night' companies. 'The 'Wild   West' days are behind us,' he asserted. 'The stigma is going away.'
 Jack Olson, vice president of Media Partners,   Adelphia's ad-sales division, agreed.
 'Infomercials are widely accepted now,' he said.   'The products that they sell are better, and people have more confidence in what they   see advertised.'
 In fact, the infomercial industry hopes that more   'mainstream' advertisers will begin to increasingly use the medium to convey   information about products and to generate leads, and not necessarily to sell products   directly, thereby taking the programming further away from its   traveling-salesman/hard-sell roots.
 Michael Wex, president and CEO of GRTV, which produces   infomercials featuring such celebrities as Fran Tarkenton, said he expects more Fortune   500 companies to use direct-response programming this year.
 'The quality will continue to get better,' he   said. 'This is a business that's growing up fast.'
 Shaver said recent infomercials by major corporations like   Sony Corp. and Toshiba Inc. pushing their digital versatile disk players will prove to be   the prototype of the kind of mainstream programming that he expects to become more   prominent on PIN.
 'There's an element of direct sell in these   programs,' Shaver said, 'but they're used more to create awareness, to   educate the consumer and to generate leads.'
 Infomercial producers also said they plan to produce more   'entertaining' programs that are closer to regular shows on cable than to   infomercials.
 For example, PIN is working on a travel show with Robin   Leach where content would be provided by travel companies, and on a program produced with   drug companies that will dispense medical advice.
 Bernard agreed that programming in the future will evolve   further away from the traditional half-hour infomercial model.
 'The lengths of the programs will be shorter,' he   predicted, 'and the positioning will be much more entertainment-oriented than it is   now.'
 Infomercial programmers are also convinced that the   industry will expand their business beyond television into areas such as direct-mail,   catalogs and even retail, perhaps with the help of cable operators.
 'I think that there are new ways for operators and   direct-response marketers to work together,' Wex said. 'There are a lot of   possibilities.'
 He cited Cablevision Systems Corp.'s recent purchase   of the bankrupt Nobody Beats the Wiz consumer-electronics retail chain as just such an   opportunity for synergy with cable operators.
 'I'm looking forward to talking with them,'   he said.
