 Nearly 1 in 10 Americans lives with diabetes, including more than 272,000 here in Maine and New Hampshire.
 Many rely on insulin as part of their daily treatment, and virtually all of those with Type 1 diabetes rely on it for survival.
 COVID-19 poses unique risks to people with diabetes which makes affordable access to insulin all the more important. Unfortunately, insulin prices have reached record highs in the United States. When you scan the pharmacy market today, the most popular insulins have prices that exceed $300 per vial - and most people with diabetes need more than one vial per month.
 While health insurance can help prevent some patients from paying that full sticker price, other patients who are in high deductible plans and people who are uninsured bear the crushing cost of those insulin prices. Sadly, much has changed since the inventors of insulin sold the discovery to a university for just $1 with the intention that everyone who needed the medication could afford it.
 As co-chairs of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, we work very closely together to improve the lives of patients with this disease. Last summer, we visited Wentworth-Douglass Hospital's Portsmouth Outpatient Center and witnessed the urgent need to address insulin prices firsthand. One patient from Franklin, New Hampshire, told us that he maxed out his credit cards to pay for the insulin he needs to stay alive. Another described the paralyzing fear he experienced being without insurance for a short period of time, when he went from paying $40 per month for insulin to more than $250 per month. These accounts echoed what we've heard in the Senate. In 2018, at a Senate Aging Committee hearing on the cost of insulin, a father from New Gloucester, Maine, testified that insulin for his 13-year-old son had tripled in price, forcing him to purchase from Canada at lower cost.
 Earlier this year, we made some headway in lowering the cost of insulin when a provision we fought for to increase competition in the insulin market was signed into law. This change will help prevent insulin manufacturers from blocking lower-priced competitors from coming to market by gaming the FDA regulatory process. The law will also help lower costs by improving and streamlining the FDA's approval process for new forms of insulin. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has also taken action by implementing a promising new model that will cap Medicare beneficiaries' insulin co-pay at $35 per month beginning in January 2021. The average beneficiary in a plan participating in the model could see out-of-pocket savings of $446--or 66%--for insulin.
 This is important bipartisan progress, but more needs to be done to lower costs. That's why we also introduced the bipartisan Insulin Price Reduction Act that would hold pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), pharmaceutical companies, and insurers accountable for surging insulin prices by incentivizing reductions in list prices. Our bill targets rebates, a key driver of insulin price hikes. Under the current system, manufacturers pay rebates to PBM middlemen and insurers in order to get their insulin covered by insurance. This creates a perverse incentive that drives up the price of insulin. Our bill would create a new insulin pricing model where the use of rebates would be restricted to any insulin product for which the manufacturer rolls back its price to what it cost in 2006. For the most popular insulins, this would result in a 75 percent decrease in prices on average. Whether you are insured or pay out of pocket, you would see a significant improvement in affordability.
 We know bipartisan progress to help patients with diabetes is possible. Together, we have successfully urged Congress to make greater investments in diabetes research and recently secured $2.1 billion -- an $81.8 million increase -- for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. These resources will advance efforts to discover a cure for the disease.
 This increased research funding comes at a time when we are also continuing our bipartisan push in the Senate to ensure ongoing support for the Special Diabetes Program, which benefits children and adults with Type 1 diabetes and Native Americans, who have a disproportionate incidence of Type 2. The program is also responsible for remarkable technological advancements to improve quality of life for patients with diabetes, including the artificial pancreas system, which tracks blood sugar levels and automatically delivers insulin when needed.
 We have also worked across the aisle to expand Medicare coverage for the use of continuous glucose monitors, so patients can track their blood sugar without needing to prick their fingers constantly. Through our efforts, Medicare now permits patients to connect these devices to their smartphones, improving patients' ability to track their blood sugar.
 These successes mark tremendous progress for those living with diabetes, but our work on behalf of patients and families in Maine, New Hampshire, and across America remains ongoing. Insulin is still too often priced like a luxury good, despite being the difference between life and death for millions of Americans. It will remain one of our top priorities to reduce this onerous burden for patients and their families.

Did you know that there is absolutely no one in this world that knows everything there is to know about grief?
 Not a single scientist, educator or physician clearly understands all aspects of what it means to grieve, nor do they know with 100 percent clarity how grief is displayed across the board because we simply cannot generalize grief.
 Why? Because we all grieve differently, and even though there are similarities and even though we have books, studies and lectures on how it is evidenced, we are still hard pressed to understand something that touches each and every one of us in our lifetimes.

CADILLAC — On June 24, 2020, just before noon, Robert Earl Sheats passed away at his Cadillac home. He was 85 years old.
 Robert was born September 29, 1934 to Ola (Cook) Sheats & Erick Sheats Sr. in Evart, Washington. He was raised by Ola (Cook) Haye & step-father Lucian Haye. He was the sixth of eight children.
 Robert (Bob) was a very lucky man. He had the love of a lifetime with his wife, Nancy, 63 years worth. He was a Jack of All Trades but a master of none. In my eyes that is better because he truly experienced life. He experienced a great loss over the last two weeks of his life. His youngest sister passed away 11 days before him and his wife passed away nine days before him.
 He was an incredible wood-worker. He spent many hours making clocks and many other beautiful projects. He loved making people smile and laugh. He was someone who could walk into a room with 100 people and come out with 99 new friends.

He presented pictures and other information to the council regarding the burning issues at the facility.
 “I know a lot of you have been around a campfire, and what usually happens, the wind changes, smoke starts to blow in your face. You find it difficult to breath, and what do you do? You start to choke. Your eyes start watering. Do you stand there and choke, or do you move?
 “Well, what if you can’t move? Many people in this town cannot move out of the smoke,” he said.
 “The city, according to the ordinance they made back in 2003, state that they are only going to burn by city employees at the city landscape area at times when the wind and other conditions are appropriate for such burning,” he said.
 He presented photos that show smoke going toward many residences in the area, including the hospital.
 He said with the locate of the yard waste facility it is going to be difficult to find a time when the wind is not coming out of the southwest.
 He said campfires are usually seasoned wood, not green wood. “That produces more smoke, abundant odor and various carcinogens,” he said. “Wood smoke is especially harmful to children, the elderly and people with lung and heart disease. Smoke can seep into your house even when your doors and windows are closed, so even if you don’t use a wood stove or fireplace, you still will be breathing the smoke.”
 Crowley said the wood and leaves that are at the yard waste facility is green, so it doesn’t burn well, it smolders.
 “I know because in the 30 years I’ve been this town, I’ve had weekends where I’ve had to smell this smoke all weekend long in my house,” he said.
 He said last year at Halloween the burning was going on while children were out trick or treating.
 “I was told last year after the meeting on the 24th that I as to come in here and talk to my alderman,” he said. “I talked to my alderman. He said he would take care of it.”
 He said the problem has not stopped.
 He also noted that the city allows residents to burn the first weekend of the month, but the yard waste facility burns more often than that, and that when the burning happens, even if it’s on the allowed burn weekend, the yard waste facility burning continues into the weekdays.
 He said in 2017, the Watseka population was 4,919.
 “According to the breakdowns of diseases in cities, there are 472 with asthma, 172 with emphysema, 157 with chronic bronchitis and a152 with congestive heart failure,” he said.
 “Approximately 1,140 citizens, or about 23 percent, are suffering from illnesses that are aggravated from breathing smoke. These numbers do not include pregnant women or children. So basically you’ve got over 25 percent of the people in this town susceptible to burning from the pile,” he said.
 “June 5 I was leaving the hospital and smelled smoke,’ he said, noting that he went to investigate the yard waste facility and found burning going on. “You see, it’s not burning very well,” he said of the photo he produced. “You don’t see any flame. That’s green wood. That’s what’s going to happen.”

PORTSMOUTH -- In spite of many city councilors' concerns about the configuration of the Middle Street bikes lanes, a modified version will continue this summer, in part because a $223,764 grant would have to be refunded.
   
 The City Council on Monday discussed the lanes at length after receiving a report from the Parking and Traffic Safety Committee which recommended modifications. The PTSC suggestions include reducing the speed limit on Middle Street to 25 miles per hour, reducing the number of bollards by 30, to about 40, and removing on-street parking at intersections to improve visibility. It also recommended researching aesthetic alternatives to the bollards, evaluating additional crosswalks and collecting ongoing usage data.
   
 During the Monday meeting, City Attorney Robert Sullivan confirmed that because the council previously accepted minutes from the PTSC meeting, in which the alternatives are suggested, the council therefore accepted the recommendations. Councilor Esther Kennedy said she has asked over the years about that and was told only the minutes were being accepted, not the actions cited within.
   
 Kennedy said she was glad to learn she had been correct, but she, Mayor Rick Becksted and counselors Paige Trace and Petra Huda said they will not accept future PTSC minutes as a result.
   
 Kennedy said she wanted parked cars, along a portion of the bike lane, to be moved back to the curb. She said she once damaged one of one of her auto mirrors, as well as one on a car parked along the bike lane, because she had nowhere else to go when another driver turned onto Union Street.
   
 "So this poor man, whose mirror I hit, I was the second person to hit it," she said. "I find it very narrow there and I find it dangerous."
   
 Kennedy said the bike lanes were one of the issues she campaigned on and she wants to improve them for the residents who live there.
   
 Becksted said he's "witnessed close calls," rarely sees a cyclist use the lanes and wants parked cars back along the curb.
   
 "I never liked this project from the beginning because there isn't another street in the city of Portsmouth that mimics this street," Becksted said. "I think it's time to make a serious change.'
   
 Councilor Deaglan McEachern noted minutes from the PTSC meeting quoted police and fire officials who said the road is safer now, the lanes make drivers pay attention and accidents have been less serious. He said he trusts the opinions of the public safety officials and does not want to have to refund $223,764 the city received in a Safe Routes to School grant to design and make the bike lanes.
   
 Planning Director Juliet Walker said Department of Transportation officials instructed the grant would have to be refunded if the bikes lanes were reconfigured with cars parked back along the curb.
   
 McEachern added that he'd like to see how this summer's modifications work before taking "drastic action."
   
 Councilor Cliff Lazenby called the PTSC recommendations a good compromise that won't "cost the taxpayers a couple hundred thousand dollars."
   
 Councilor John Tabor said he spoke with residents who live near the bike lanes and, during a recent visit, observed the 1,600-foot stretch where cars are parked in the road, with the bike lane between the cars and the curb. He said anyone who parks there has to open their driver's side door into traffic, he called it dangerous and said users have to "run for your life" to get to the other side.
   
 Tabor said he also has concerns about refunding the grant money, so "the least miserable option" is to keep the bike lanes and the money, then revisit it all in the fall.
   
 Councilor Paige Trace said drivers have to pull too far out to see if there's oncoming traffic, which she called dangerous and "playing a game of chicken." She also agreed with Kennedy that the inbound bike lane ends at a law office and doesn't continue to the middle school.
   
 "Maybe it's time to look at a safer route that takes them to school," she said.
   
 City Manager Karen Conard noted that if the bike lanes were removed, the city would also have to pay for engineering and paving to restore the conditions.
   
 "Do you realize this is more controversial than the budget?" asked Assistant Mayor Jim Splaine, who said he has safety concerns, thinks there should be more bike lanes, but doesn't want to have to return the grant money.
   
 In a convoluted vote whether to suspend rules, to allow a vote whether to undo its prior action accepting the PTSC minutes, a majority of the council voted no. The vote killed further action on the bike lanes for this season.

There have been two significant legal developments this week related to glyphosate use.
 First, a Ninth Circuit justice rejected California’s local labeling requirements under Proposition 65 for glyphosate, issuing a permanent injunction.
 A day later, Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, announced it will settle 125,000 lawsuits that allege its popular herbicide caused non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
 California's Proposition 65 has come under fire before in the court system. The state lists 900-some substances as causing problems from cancer to birth defects, and requires any product containing them to include warning labels.
 Among substances on the list is acrylamide, a potential carcinogen formed in trace amounts whenever food products like potatoes are fried or, in the case of coffee beans, roasted.
 As a result, California had been requiring a warning label on coffee beans. Eventually, through litigation, this was clarified to say that roasting coffee beans is not considered significantly carcinogenic by any federal regulatory agency.
 Glyphosate, meanwhile, was listed as cancer-causing by California in 2017. That would have triggered a warning label, but Ninth Circuit Justice William Shubb issued a preliminary injunction against that in 2018, pointing out the wide disparity between California’s position and that of most other regulatory bodies in the world.
 “It is inherently misleading for a warning to state that a chemical is known to the state of California to cause cancer based on the finding of one organization when apparently all other regulatory and governmental bodies have found the opposite,” he said at the time.
 Developments since have not changed his mind, the judge said this week in issuing the permanent injunction.
 National Wheat Growers Association was the lead plaintiff in the case.
 “From the beginning we made our case based on facts and science and this is a great win for wheat growers and farmers across the United States,” said Dave Milligan, NAWG President and Cass City, Michigan wheat farmer. “Backed by more than forty years of safety data, glyphosate is one of the most studied and closely monitored herbicides in the world.”
 NAWG was joined by a variety of other farm groups in the suit, including the U.S. Durum Growers, National Corn Growers Association, and the North Dakota Grain Growers Association.
 ““This has been an ongoing battle, and we’re pleased Judge Shubb agreed the science does not support the claim Proposition 65 is trying to make,” NDGGA President Dennis Haugen said in a media release. “The use of safe herbicides and pesticides is vital to sustaining American agriculture, and we’re hoping this decision will set a standard for practical policy going forward.”
 Haugen was recently named to the EPA’s Farm, Ranch and Rural Communities Committee.
 “It’s crucial we communicate to the EPA the effects not having access to certain chemicals would have on our fields so they understand how to best regulate these products in a way that’s good for the environment and farmers,” he said.
 Bayer’s announcement, meanwhile, follows recent verdicts against it in three separate cases, all of which the company said are under appeal, and that it will continue to defend.
 The three cases won’t be covered by the settlement, which itself does not admit to any liability or wrongdoing, the company said, but simply acknowledges the significant costs and risks associated with defending thousands of suits.
 The company continues to argue its product does not cause cancer if it is used properly, according to the label, and said it will continue to sell the popular herbicide.

In the Axios/Ipsos polling, you can clearly see how much ahead of the curve New York (among the 28 states for which we had at least 75 respondents) and the Mid-Atlantic (see here for all Census division subsets) portion of the Northeast are when it comes to mask wearing. Of the over 750 Mid-Atlantic respondents, 64% say they are always wearing masks when they go out. As Ipsos did in a recent poll with the Washington Post, they were able to drill down to the state level in some instances too.

Rai says Oura is in talks with other leagues about using the technology once they follow suit and resume playing. He says he envisions a broader future for Oura than strictly being used in sports settings. The company has developed a health risk management platform to be used in the workforce. Members can share data with a “coach” who can work with people to better understand their health or work with groups to identify patterns.

When given the go-ahead for the mosaic, Goodman and BSU put out the call for students to submit words that “capture their feelings about their time at Bemidji State University, or your feelings about the end of your time at BSU and the impact that COVID-19 has had on your experience.”
 Both English and Ojibwe words will be incorporated in the mosaic -- a total of about 12 will make it into the final project.
 “Because a mosaic is really about being pieces of a whole and it’s the whole that needs to be really magnificent and beautiful and tell a story,” she said. “In a way when we are talking about community, creating a mosaic is a wonderful metaphor, and it’s a great way to use this artwork to rally this community.”
 One of the reasons Goodman was chosen as the artist to complete this project was her initial design’s appeal to BSU’s connection with the land and its desire to provide a sense of place.
 “What sold the committee on her was her concept of an installation with a very local natural theme -- but not one that was too over the top with pine trees and loons -- her very evident knowledge of and comfort with mosaic materials and installations, and above all her express desire to interview and gather information -- and eventually actual objects -- from faculty, staff, and students to inform her work and actually be installed in it,” Blessing said.
 ## The process
 First, came the planning process and initial designs. Then, students submitted words, and objects were collected to incorporate into the piece.
 Now, Goodman is beginning to fabricate the mosaic in her studio in Minneapolis.
 She plans to document this over the course of the summer. In a recent Facebook video, she showed the pieces of the mosaic laid out on the floor of her studio. Goodman has been updating the mosaic’s progress on her Instagram account, @staciagoodmanmosaics.
