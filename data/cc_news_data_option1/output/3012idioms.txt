After months of preparation, the Voluntary Action Center will serve its first dinners on Tuesday as part of its highly-anticipated dinner meal program. Hot meals will be served every Tuesday from 5 to 6:30 p.m. as part of the program, with a second night of meals to be added in October.
 “We’re so excited to finally do this. It’s a blessing for us. It’s a blessing for the clients and the folks who come out and serve. The volunteers for our lunch program love it and look forward to doing it,” said Executive Director Stacy Long. “Our goal is to make sure no one in Gordon County goes hungry, and providing dinner is going to make a big difference.”
 Long said those seeking meals will be asked to check in at the VAC office. They will then receive a special card that they can exchange for a dinner plate. For now, all meals will be to-go in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19, but she said the center hopes to start serving in the dining room soon.
 VAC employees and board members will be prepping and serving to-go plates to clients on Tuesday, however the center is actively looking for volunteer groups and organizations to help with cooking and serving in the coming months. So far, four churches — Trinity Baptist Church, Belmont Baptist Church, Rock Bridge Community Church and Calhoun First United Methodist — have agreed to take on the task for a day or more every month.
 “We would love to get more groups who are committed to that one day a month,” Long said. “We’re especially looking for a group that can volunteer on the first and fifth Tuesdays in September.”
 Volunteer groups can opt in at different levels of involvement. Some choose to purchase food and ingredients, cook the food, serve the meals and do clean up afterward. Others choose to come in and cook a meal with ingredients provided by the VAC, serve the meal and provide clean up. Others choose to come in, heat up a meal cooked by VAC employees, serve the meal and clean up afterward. All of these different ways of getting involved are greatly appreciated, Long said.
 “In a nutshell, volunteers come in, they heat the meal up or cook it, put it in plates and hand it to the folks who are coming in to eat. We ask that they clean up afterward, but that’s it,” she said. “We want this to be as easy as possible for our volunteers.”
 Those interested in volunteering should contact Long at stacy.long@voluntaryactioncenter.org.
 The roll-out of the VAC’s dinner program was made possible thanks to donations made to the center since January. In particular, Long credited the anonymously-funded $25,000 match grant that began in May with providing a large chunk of the funding necessary to get the initial phase of the program off the ground.
 “We are so thankful and appreciative of the support, both from our donor and the community,” Long said. “Everyone who made a contribution made a difference for families here in the county.”
 Included in that matching grant was a $5,000 donation from myDOCTORplan.
 “myDOCTORplan’s generous donation will help ensure individuals and families continue to receive support through our hunger and homeless outreach programs. Together, with other donations like myDOCTORplan’s, we were able to raise $60,000, $10,000 more than our original goal,” said Long.
 The VAC is located at 343 S. Wall St. in Calhoun. Dinners will be served on Tuesday, beginning at 5 p.m.

At least once per day, the newsroom’s phones ring or we’ll receive an online message informing us of one case or more of novel coronavirus at a local business, retail store or restaurant.
 Early in the pandemic, when cases were first creeping into Northeast Tennessee, it made sense for the Press to investigate such tips and report those based in fact.
 But now that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through the region, especially here in Washington County, specific situations are only news if they represent a cluster of cases, force a business to close or result in an official health alert.
 That’s because at this stage of the pandemic, if you go anywhere in public, the probable presence of COVID-19 is growing. The latter is certainly true in such urbanized centers as the Nashville area where about 5,000 known active cases stand in Davidson County alone — emphasis on the word known.
 Here in these upper eight counties, known active cases have grown by 60.31% in the last seven days alone. In Washington County, that rate is at 79.26%. Again, the emphasis is on the word known.
 That tells us that if you’re anywhere in public on a frequent basis — whether visiting a grocery store, the mall, a restaurant, a pharmacy, a home improvement store, a church or all of the above — COVID-19 could be in the mix. You are likely to be within close proximity of someone with the virus at some point during the week. If that’s not an absolute now, it will be soon.
 So rather than worry about which location might have a case or two, treat every public setting as if COVID-19 is right in your face.
 That also applies to the homes of family and friends. Your guard must be up anywhere except in the privacy of your own home, and even there, it’s wise to practice frequent cleaning and hand-washing to protect family members and vice versa.
 Limit the frequency of your trips out when possible. Buy a week’s worth of groceries and other goods in one trip. Use pick-up lanes or delivery services where available. If you dine out, take advantage of restaurants that follow social distancing practices. Choose businesses that enforce the local mask mandates and have strict precautionary compliance among employees. Avoid at all costs those businesses who don’t.
 If you manage or own a business open to the public, enforce compliance at the door and throughout your location — both for employees and the public. If your business has a host of cases, shut it down.
 Above all, everyone should wear a mask in public. You “freedom fighters” out there may not care about your own safety, but if you can’t treat your fellow citizens with enough respect to simply cover your mouth and nose, just stay home.
 This country — and more specifically this particular community — cannot economically endure another widespread shutdown. That’s unlikely to occur, but certain sectors and individual businesses may find themselves back in that boat if people do not treat this critical juncture in the pandemic with the necessary seriousness.
 Doing the right thing is a lot easier than living through a perpetual health and economic crisis.

If this experience sounds foreign to most Americans, that's because it is. Hamann lives in Paderborn, a city of 148,000 in north-central Germany, and she is benefiting from that country's trademark approach to economic downturns. Instead of leaving employers to lay off workers en masse during hard times, and then have the workers apply individually for unemployment benefits, the German government subsidizes employers' payrolls directly. Workers at a given firm or business agree to all work fewer hours, to spread what work remains among the whole staff instead of having some people laid off. But through government subsidies, they continue to receive a sizable share of their usual pay, as high as 87%, even if circumstances have them working few hours for the time being. When the economic crisis passes, they return to work full time, without the upheaval of losing a job and filing for unemployment on their own.
 Some 10 million Germans are currently benefiting from Kurzarbeit, as it's called there -- literally, short-work. It has been adopted in similar form during the pandemic crisis by several other countries, including France, Spain, and the UK.
 But in the US, despite half-hearted efforts in some states, the workshare approach, as it's typically referred to here, is barely a blip on the horizon. Americans have filed more than 40 million claims for unemployment benefits in the past 10 weeks. Meanwhile, there are fewer than 200,000 Americans benefiting from workshare payments while remaining employed, according to a tally by Susan Houseman, an economist with the nonpartisan W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Michigan.
 It might be tempting to view workshare as a luxury of the stronger safety nets in Europe and the high taxes that pay for them. But the lofty tax rates in Germany mostly fund generous coverage for illness, disability, and pensions. When it comes to unemployment, according to Houseman and other economists, the US and Germany spend comparable amounts per person. Both approaches are costing governments on either side of the ocean tens of billions of dollars. If anything, the US is now spending _more_ , proportional to the size of its population, on its safety net for the unemployed. (More on that later.)
