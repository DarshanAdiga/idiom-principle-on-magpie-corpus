Grosshans' appointment, the latest effort by DeSantis to shift the court in a conservative direction, was praised by some in Central Florida’s legal community who described her as well-qualified and fair-minded, but criticized by others as an act of political patronage.
 “You can trust that I will bring a fidelity to the law and an unyielding respect for the separation of powers to my service on the court,” said Grosshans, 41, after she was appointed Monday.
 ##  Ex-JNC chair: ‘Obviously qualified’
 Christopher Carmody, a lobbyist and attorney with GrayRobinson, said he was chair of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Nominating Commission when fellow commission member Joshua Grosshans told him his wife, Jamie Grosshans, wanted to apply for an empty spot on the Orange County bench in 2017.
 After speaking with the governor’s general counsel, Carmody said they decided Joshua Grosshans would recuse himself from the process, which includes candidate interviews, to “avoid any impropriety.”
 “She’s obviously qualified,” Carmody said. “... I know I went out of my way to make it clear to the applicants and to the members of the JNC that Mr. Grosshans was recused from the process and was not going to be engaging in any form.”
 Neither Grosshanses responded to a request for comment.
 Grosshans was among six candidates the JNC sent to then-Gov. Rick Scott, who appointed her to the bench.
 A year later, Grosshans was appointed by Scott to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, chosen ahead of 14 circuit judges who applied for the position and had more experience on the bench — including one candidate who had been a judge for 15 years at the time.

Steve è passato a trovarci quando abbiamo spostato le prove sul palco che avremmo usato in tour. Eravamo in una specie di hangar. Lo conoscevo tramite i Lone Justice. Bruce all’epoca voleva concentrarsi sulle canzoni di _Human Touch_ e _Lucky Town_ , Steven continuava a ripetergli che avrebbe dovuto suonare _Prove It All Night_ o _Badlands_. È una delle poche volte in cui ho visto Bruce dubitare di sé.
 Steve ha assistito a un giorno di prove. È stato strano per noi nuovi nella band sentire che c'era la possibilità che si unisse al tour. Ho sempre avuto belle esperienze con Steven, ma allo stesso tempo ci sentivamo messi in dubbio, come se non avessimo conquistato la fiducia di Bruce. Forse sentiva la mancanza di Steven e Clarence.
 Alla fine è stata Crystal Taliefero a prendere il suo posto sul palco. Bruce aveva deciso di lasciare le cose com’erano. È interessante, perché un anno dopo mi ha invitato alla sua festa di compleanno e c’era anche Steven. Era un po’ in crisi, non faceva nulla. Poi, dopo poco tempo, sono arrivati i _Soprano_ e la sua carriera è decollata un’altra volta.<span

The 32-year-old, who always considered basketball as an outlet for his emotions, wrote: "I'd only played 18 games with the Timberwolves that season, breaking my right hand twice, and that was when this whole … I guess you'd call it a facade or a character that I had sort of built up …. it all started crumbling. I was in a cast. My identity was gone. My emotional outlet was gone. All I was left with was me and my mind."

In her resignation letter, Harsimrat Kaur Badal maintained that it was impossible for her to perform her duties as a Union Minister as the SAD could not go against the interest of the farmers. She lamented that the Centre did not take farmers on board despite her best attempt to persuade the Union Cabinet in this regard. The SAD wanted the bills concerning the marketing of farmers' produce to be referred to a Select Committee. Badal stated that her decision to resign was guided by the tradition of her party to always defend the national interest.

It let me off the hook while letting Black citizens be shot in the back and blamed for their own murders. Its toughness on crime imprisons them for any infraction or none at all and then blames them for not prospering. The current system oppresses by violence and by policy, by a closed fist and a closed purse and a brutally closed heart.
 I ran from them, I ran at them, my dad grabbed them, and I yelled at them, and I am still alive and uninjured and free. And I never worried about the other possibilities until years later.
 That is an enormous privilege, one that doesn’t come with being Black in America.

1\. Why are you running for school board? I feel strongly about the importance of a good education and the impact it has on the student’s ability to have a successful life. I have enjoyed serving on the board and find that it’s very fulfilling to be able to work with other board members and administration to develop and implement policies that will help all our students to achieve at their highest level. I thought very seriously about whether to run, but when I see the COVID 19 crisis that we are in, I felt my experience on the board is important at this time and chose to run again. Not that I have all the answers for this situation, but I do have experience.
 2\. What are the biggest challenges facing Pine City Schools at this time, and how will you address them? Before COVID 19, one of the things the board was concerned with was that some of our test scores were not where we want them to be, so we were looking at ways to improve those scores. I realize that test scores are not the whole picture, but they really are a barometer about where we are at as a school. The data we receive, compares us to other local school districts. Where we used to be at the top in comparison, now we are not. That is a concern. Another challenge we have is that we are in an information age where information is available at your fingertips. However, the problem is that all information is not accurate. What we need is to instill in our students is the ability to be critical thinkers, examining the information to determine if it is true. Our most important thing as a school district is to educate, not indoctrinate. Another challenge because of COVID 19 that we need to be at least thinking about is the financial situation when all this shakes out. The reality is a lot of revenue was lost and how will that be made up? This will affect our school.

When I was 25, I ran at a pair of Los Angeles police officers with a large stick in my hand. The stick wasn’t meant for them; they showed up while I was (stupidly) storming around the block looking for whomever had just broken into my apartment — but they didn’t know that. They didn’t shoot me. They laughed. They also laughed at the not-yet-legal pot my roommate left out. We didn’t get our stuff back, but I didn’t get shot, and we didn’t go to jail.
 When I was 26, I got in the face of a cop from L.A.’s Rampart Division, where in the late ’90s more than 70 officers were implicated in unprovoked beatings and shootings and planting and covering up evidence. I yelled at him for not wanting to write a report after I was the victim in a hit and run. He didn’t lay a finger on me.

"The boards are empowered to create rules and policies to reasonably manage health and safety for kids and staff," she said.
 However, she acknowledged there may be circumstances that allow flexibility in the dates.
 "Students whose parents aren't able to cope with learning from home because of a learning disability, and they realized it's not an appropriate tool for the child to learn. You could imagine there will be exceptions here. But for parents who are just uneasy, that's harder for them because of sanitization and resource issues."
 As the school year presses on, Molyneaux said she expects she will be getting calls from parents about this.
 "I think they are being put between a rock and a hard place," she said.

Moore and Sheyi Ojo have been brought in to bolster the attacking ranks so far in this transfer window, however Neil Harris on Thursday revealed he was still keen to add further quality at the top end of the pitch.
 And Morrison is sure there will be "a few" more signings before the domestic window closes on October 16.
 “We have got a settled squad, a fairly small squad, but a great group," he added.
 "I’m sure come October, when the transfer window shuts, there will be a couple of new faces, but with the amount of games coming from that October period until Christmas we are going to need the squad.
 “If there are a few new faces they will be welcomed and if they hit the ground running then that's fantastic for us.
 “But at the moment, the squad looks welcomed, but I’m pretty certain there will be a few faces come the end of the transfer window, for sure.”
