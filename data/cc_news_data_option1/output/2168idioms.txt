The news came a day after the Bay Area News Group published an article about the encampments, which formed earlier this year and marked the first time in recent memory that Cupertino has had a visible homelessness problem. The camps -- a cluster of fewer than a dozen tents next to the Vallco construction site, and one make-shift shelter across from the Apple campus -- were created by residents who had previously been living out-of-sight along Cupertino's highway on and off-ramps and creek beds. Since then, the city and the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office have been flooded with complaints about the new, more high-profile camps.

The NBA is finalizing details of a plan which is expected to be approved by the league's Board of Governors on Thursday, paving the way for a return from the coronavirus shutdown.
 The board is poised to give the green light to commissioner Adam Silver's return of basketball which would begin July 31 with a 22-team format, and end in mid-October with a champion being crowned, ESPN reported.
 The plan requires support from three quarters of the league's 30 teams in order to be approved.
 The NBA suspended its season on March 11 because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Nets and Orlando Magic currently hold the playoff spots in the Eastern Conference.
 The Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies occupy the postseason positions in the Western Conference.
 Under the plan, each of the 22 teams will play eight regular-season games for seeding purposes for the postseason.
 The 16 teams currently in the playoff picture will be joined by the New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference.
 In the East, the Washington Wizards are also included.
 The Pelicans (28-36), Kings (28-36) and Trail Blazers (29-37) are 3 1/2 games behind the eighth-place Memphis Grizzlies (32-33) in the Western Conference.
 The Spurs (27-36) are four games adrift of the Grizzlies, while the Suns (26-39) are six behind.
 Washington (24-40) is six games behind the seventh-place Brooklyn Nets (30-34) and 5 1/2 back of the eighth-place Orlando Magic (30-35).
 All games are expected to be within the confines of Disney's ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando Florida, with all teams remaining on site to minimise risk of COVID-19 outbreaks.
 Once it becomes official, the format would bring an abrupt end to the season for eight teams languishing outside the top 22.
 The restart is also expected to include a two-week quarantine for players in their home cities, one to two weeks of workouts at team facilities followed by two-week training camps.
 The league wants to have daily testing and if a player tests positive he would be isolated and quarantined. The others would carry on playing while still being tested on a daily basis.
 The regular season was halted abruptly after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive. Gobert, of France, was given the all-clear about two weeks later.
 So far, less than a dozen NBA players have been confirmed as testing positive for the coronavirus although not all have been identified.

"We want to convey our strong encouragement for people who participated in some way in a demonstration or in any large gathering in any way —such as a vigil, clean-up events, folks providing water or foods to protesters, anyone who participated in these large gatherings — we are strongly encouraging you to get tested for COVID-19," said state Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm on a press call Wednesday, June 3.
 The announcement comes two days after health officials said Monday that they would wait a few days before offering guidance, in recognition of the need to allow those who may have been exposed to develop a testable presence of coronavirus.
 Malcolm advised people seeking tests to visit their primary care provider, and if they do not have a primary care provider, to consult the state COVID-19 website for directions to a testing center nearby.
 Also Wednesday, Malcolm addressed a question by a caller during a radio interview who asked if the use of tear gas and pepper spray by law enforcement — weapons causing the shedding of tears, runny nose and coughing — likely worsened the transmission of COVID-19 among protesters .

The Dallas Mavericks would be virtually assured of clinching a West spot, holding a seven-game lead over eighth-place Memphis. That would mean the Grizzlies, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix all would be in the running for the No. 8 seed out West.

A former president of United Auto Workers faces up to five years in prison after pleading guilty Wednesday to embezzling more than $1 million dollars in union funds and evading taxes.
 Gary Jones, 63, who served as UAW President from June 2018 until resigning last December, admitted to one count of conspiring to embezzle union dues money and conspiring to use a facility of interstate commerce to aid racketeering crimes.
 He also pled guilty to a separate count of conspiring to defraud the United States by evading the payment of taxes on embezzled funds and filing false tax returns.
 During a video conference, Jones admitted that while serving as the director of UAW's western region, he deliberately falsified expense reports filed with union headquarters in Detroit for personal gain.
 He also said he failed to pay federal taxes on the money he illicitly diverted from the union, and collected kickbacks from another union official who was embezzling from the UAW via expense reports.
 Reading from a prepared statement, Jones said he was sorry for betraying his "UAW family... wife and daughters and their families."
 According to court documents, Jones admitted to conspiring with at least six other union officials to embezzle money from the UAW by concealing it in the costs of regional union conferences.
 As part of the plea deal, Jones also agreed to cooperate with the government in prosecuting other union leaders and forfeit about $119,000 in union funds, a set of golf clubs and $32,377 in cash seized by the government last August.
 Jones is the fourteenth defendant to be convicted in connection with the ongoing criminal investigation into corruption within the UAW and illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles executives.
