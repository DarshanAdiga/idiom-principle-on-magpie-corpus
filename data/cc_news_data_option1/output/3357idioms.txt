If there is a better community supporter (and community creator) in Shoreline than Megan, I don't know who that might be. So, please do visit this vibrant Ridgecrest hub (outdoor seating only for the time being).

His Facebook posts are the only thing that I know of him. He stated that “he just 'reposted' someone else’s statement.” Reposting means one accepts the responsibility for that statement and that you want others to see it.

On the same page, reporter Dorothy Aiton interviewed women on Montgomery Street who didn't seem to be very involved in the strike or the protest -- although not opposed to its aims. One working woman eating her lunch on a bench told Aiton she was supportive of more child care.
