In 2017, Griffith’s Park Board and Parks & Recreation Department began implementing a five-year master plan to make the town's facilities more inviting to community members of all ages.
 Now in its fourth year, the ambitious plan based on information gathered from public meetings and community surveys has seen significant upgrades, renovations and new attractions in parks, says Tim Diamond, president of the Griffith Park Board.
 Among finished projects are an upgraded playground at Central Park, 698 N. Broad St., playground with a soft surface and Americans with Disabilities Act compliant equipment, Al Markut, superintendent of Griffith Parks & Recreation Department says, making it a major draw for children with disabilities.

The weather service also confirmed two tornadoes in southern Wisconsin and two in northern Indiana, including an EF-1 that swept the rural community of Wakarusa, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of South Bend, leaving behind smashed grain bins, damaged barns and farmhouses.
 Crews throughout the region have been working around the clock to restore electricity, but they've been hindered by large trees that are blocking many roads and sitting on top of power lines. Those trees must be removed before power can be restored.
 Iowa's three largest metropolitan areas of Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport still had widespread outages as of Wednesday morning.
 Alliant Energy said about 176,000 of its customers are without power, about half of which are in the Cedar Rapids area. MidAmerican Energy said about 139,000 of its Iowa and Illinois customers remain without power, half them in the Des Moines area.
 As of late Wednesday morning, ComEd reported that about 200,000 of its Chicago-area customers remained without power. Northern Indiana Public Service Co. reported about 18,500 of its Indiana customers were still in the dark.
 Mediacom said Wednesday that it has restored internet service to about half of the 340,000 customers that were offline a day earlier in Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. But many others may be without service until their power is restored, a process that could still take multiple days in places.
 The storm caused extensive crop damage in the nation's No. 1 corn producing state as it tore across Iowa's center from west to east.
 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Tuesday that about 10 million acres of Iowa’s nearly 31 million acres of agriculture land sustained damage. About 24 million acres of that is land typically planted primarily in corn and soybeans.
 In addition, tens of millions of bushels of grain that were stored at co-ops and on farms were damaged or destroyed as bins blew away.
 The only known death in Iowa was a 63-year-old bicyclist who was hit by one of several large trees that fell on a bike path outside of Cedar Rapids. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, the storm killed a 73-year-old woman who was found clutching a young boy in her storm-battered mobile home.
 Many businesses, including banks, restaurants and a major corn processing plant in Cedar Rapids, remained closed Wednesday due to power outages.
 The Cedar Rapids school district reported that over 20 of its buildings had roof and other structural damage, ranging from minor to significant, and that it was considering pushing back this month’s start date.
 State Sen. Liz Mathis said she took cover in the basement of her suburban Cedar Rapids home Monday as the storm battered her neighborhood for 45 minutes. She said pictures fell of the wall, water seeped in through windows and she worried the glass would blow in and hurt her.
 Mathis said the devastation is widespread across her district, and the “tree damage is unreal.” People are waiting an hour or longer at gas stations to fill up their vehicles and get fuel for chain saws, as some are closed or have run out of gas, she said.
 Residents are clearing out their refrigerators and freezers after their food has spoiled. A local utility official told Mathis on Wednesday that it could be a week before everyone’s power is restored.
 “The cities are going to look much different without the trees and it’s going to take a while to recover from this,” she said.

Christina Klespies said she is able to see in retrospect how she let her guard down in allowing her son free rein in going to high school graduation parties and an out-of-state camping trip amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But like so many other parents, she felt badly that her son, Ryan, was missing out on so much of his senior year at Chesterton High School.

As we’ve shifted into a new normal amid the COVID-19 pandemic, only time will tell what parts of our new world stick and become part of the regular landscape of life.
 In the health care arena, there have been immense changes, including a swift and massive move from seeing doctors in person to visiting them virtually.
 Community Healthcare System started offering virtual visits in early April shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak. “Since that time and continuing today, we offer patients the ability to have a visit in-person or virtually,” said Dr. Alan Kumar, senior vice president of medical affairs and chief medical officer at Community. “At the peak, we were probably doing 60% of outpatient visits virtually. As the number of cases have fallen in Lake County, we are now probably down to about 20% of visits being done virtually on a weekly basis.”

Viking has endeavored to be as proactive as possible in terms of increasing storage capacity and lowering production rates of certain wells to avoid selling oil from certain leases at prior low prices. For example, in May, Viking, through various subsidiaries, rented approximately 44 portable storage containers to situate on certain properties to store product until commodity prices increased. Viking also reduced production rates and/or ceased producing hydrocarbons from approximately 13 wells, with a view to re-activating the wells when pricing improved.

Imperial Beach put $150,000 into its COVID-19 business relief program. But so far, businesses have only gotten $40,000.
 To help get more money in business owners’ pockets, the City Council last week expanded both eligibility requirements and the amount of money businesses can receive.
 The original business relief program, passed by the council in June, allowed businesses with 25 or fewer employees to receive up to $2,500. The money was a reimbursement, not a loan, so businesses had to submit receipts of COVID- related costs they had accrued during the pandemic.
 City officials quickly realized the $2,500 limit was not enough.
