That was a defining moment in post-war international relations. For the first time, Nato intervened not in response to a threat against a member state but to avert a humanitarian emergency – out of a duty to protect.
 Subsequently, military interventions were sanctioned to protect no-fly zones in northern Iraq and in Sierra Leone.
 With the Iraq war, much of the moral authority of using force to protect human rights was dissipated.
 France and the UK later intervened to prevent the annihilation of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Benghazi in Libya in 2011. But as in Iraq, regime change followed with all the unintended consequences that have made western government recoil from such interventions ever since.
 Even in the face of chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime, or systematic human rights violations in Yemen, the West has failed to act.
 Where is there now a western government which will rise to stay the hand of the executioner, or stem the slaughter of innocents?
 In Myanmar we have witnessed the morbid paradox of a Nobel Laureate defend her country against allegations of genocide over its treatment of its Rohingya people.
 Closer to home, just a few hundred kilometres from Srebrenica, Kosovo president Hashim Thaci and nine other former separatist fighters have just been indicted on a range of crimes against humanity during and after Kosovo’s 1998-99 independence war with Serbia.
 Although Thaci is no longer considered part of the talks on account of the charges, the EU-facilitated Kosovo-Serbia dialogue is about to restart.
 Outside Europe, the big power brokers of world politics seem uninterested in the rule of international law. The “responsibility to protect” was finally adopted by the UN in 2005 in the wake of the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda. Will it be of any consequence to leaders such as Xi Jinping, Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin?
 As Europeans, who value respect for the rule of law and human rights, we should nevertheless take courage from the progress that _has_ been made. Since the Srebrenica genocide, there has been a growth both in the range of international criminal courts and in the war crimes cases. Much of this has been driven by lawyers and institutions from the EU and EU member states.
 Twenty five years on, the witness we bear to the Srebrenica genocide must make us continue to fight for all who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity to be brought to justice – whoever, and wherever they may be.
 We must also work continuously to restore respect for international law and to give life and effect to the responsibility to protect. It is a part of Europe’s mission in the world that must never be abandoned. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?

Leandro Bacuna has also played for Reading and Aston Villa
 "It's not all about playing long balls anymore. We try to play from the back as well," he said.
 "Since we've been back from lockdown, we haven't really scored from a set- piece, which was one of our strengths.
 "We have been scoring goals from open play. It's a different way we have been playing but it's successful."
 Warnock was Cardiff manager for just over three years, and guided the club to the Premier League - the eighth promotion of his career - in 2017-18.
 The club were relegated the following season and were 14th in the Championship when he departed.
 He returned to football at struggling Middlesbrough last month and has won three of his six games to put the Teesside club on the brink of securing Championship status for next season.
 Nevertheless, Bacuna is confident Cardiff can claim a victory which would seal their top-six spot if Millwall and Swansea City fail to win their weekend games.
 "I think it will be nice playing against someone who signed me, but now I'm not really thinking about it," Bacuna said.
 "It's all about us. If we do the right thing, work hard and play the tactics the manager gave us, I don't think we have got any trouble beating Middlesbrough."

I'm sure you've all heard the expression "I think, therefore I am"; it was first coined by the philosopher Rene Descartes in 1637 and it describes, succinctly, the limits placed upon human cognition and on the whole idea of 'knowledge'. It points out, essentially, that the only thing you can know with absolute certainty is that your consciousness exists in this precise moment in time. Everything else, including your own physical form, the entire universe around you and all your memories, could be a figment of your imagination. It probably isn't, but there's no way of proving it. Your mind exists and it exists right now; everything else is debatable. I forget when I was first introduced to this concept by my philosophically-minded father; probably when I was rather too young, as I've never been able to shake off the feeling that it might be true. That everything actually could be an illusion, and that to choose to believe otherwise is an act of will. But while Descartes was right in that there is no way definitively to prove that the universe is in fact real, one can at least prove it to one's own satisfaction. In my case, all I have to do is to remind myself that if everything I think I've experienced really were just a figment of my imagination, that would mean that it was in fact me who wrote the complete works of Shakespeare, Beethoven, The Beatles and Douglas Adams. And I'm just not that good. I'm okay, but I'm not that good. Solipsism - the belief that one is the only real person in existence and that everything and everyone else is imaginary - may be an interesting philosophical notion but it's no way to live your life and it's certainly no way to run the world's last remaining superpower. Which is a shame, because Donald Trump shows every sign of believing it wholeheartedly. Now as I've said before, I'm uncomfortable with people, even trained psychologists, trotting out pat diagnoses of the mental states of public figures with whom they've had no personal contact. However, this week sees the publication of Too Much and Never Enough, the memoir of Trump's niece Mary, who has a great deal of personal experience of the president and is also a clinical psychologist. She broadly concurs with the general consensus that her uncle is a narcissist who is barely capable of feeling any concern or sympathy for anyone other than himself. But I think, in the light of some of his recent statements, that it seems to go beyond that. In particular, consider Trump's repeated assertion that if only people would stop getting tested for the coronavirus then there would be fewer instances of that virus. His 'people' tried to pass this off at a joke when he trotted it out at the disastrous Tulsa rally but he keeps reiterating it. Now the cognitive functions of anyone over the age of about four will tell you that something doesn't go away just because you don't know about it, but what if one were an actual solipsist? What if one believed that the only thing that's real is your own consciousness and that as such, the only things that exist at any given time are you and the things you're aware of? Might you not therefore express the desire that people should stop finding out about this disease (and, moreover, stop telling you about it) because it's only the fact that you know about it that's making it happen? What's perhaps the most alarming thing to contemplate (apart from the fact that the guy who has the nuclear codes to destroy the world might be less than entirely convinced that the world actually exists in the first place) is that Trump is not, in this, massively out of step with a great swathe of the population as a whole, on both ends of the political spectrum. The idea that one can 'believe' something into existence (or indeed ignore something else out of existence), that faith and fervour alone are sufficient to bend the fabric of reality, has been driving a lot of the political energy on both the left and right wings over last few years. Not much else can explain the Corbyntologists' eagerness to go into last year's general election confident of victory despite their beloved leader's personal polling barely scraping into double digits at the time (I remember reading tweets by devout Corbynians back in November making casual reference to "when we win the election"; not "if"; "when"). There may have been factors other than sheer belief (and wilful ignorance of the facts) propelling the momentum towards Brexit back in 2016 but there's literally nothing else which explains the continuing enthusiasm (such as it is) for the doomed project in the present day, now that even the government's own spokesbeings are cheerfully acknowledging the massive economic and social toll it will take (while insisting, of course, that they'd been saying this for five years). Just because the leader of the free world doesn't understand how reality works is no excuse for the rest of us.

"AFC Fylde now looks forward to building both on and off the field ahead of a new campaign," a club statement said.
 "Whilst the club remains disappointed on a number of areas, such as miscommunication provided by the National League at already uncertain times, we wholeheartedly accept as a club that overall it has been a disappointing campaign at Mill Farm and we wish to move forward now and plan ahead for a successful 2020-2021 league season."
 The club's statement comes two days after Ebbsfleet, who were also in the drop zone, said they would not proceed with a legal challenge against their relegation.
 Fylde, who had games in hand on Ebbsfleet and Maidenhead, the two teams immediately above them when the season was halted by coronavirus, said they had considered joining that challenge, but ultimately decided against it.
 "The reason we are not pursuing any legal action is because it would adversely affect the continuation of the game we love," the statement continued.
 "Teams are looking to be promoted, so with that comes relegation and we reluctantly accept our fate on this."

Srebrenica is a small town in Europe, located in the easternmost part of Republika Srpska, one of the two entities which make up Bosnia-Herzegovina, near the border with Serbia. As the crow flies, it lies just about halfway between Bologna and Bucharest.
 Over a handful of days, from July 11, 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically killed there by the Bosnian Serb army under the command of Ratko Mladic, on the direction of Radovan Karadžic, in what was at that time a UN ‘safe haven’. It was the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust.
 Twenty five years on from the massacre, what do we see?
 Mladic and Karadzic (who received part of his medical training as a psychiatrist at Columbia University in New York) are serving life sentences following their convictions by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. And what of the region itself?
 Serbia is applying to join the European Union. Bosnia-Herzegovina is an independent state, still under partial international oversight, comprised of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – home mostly to Bosniaks and Croats – and the Republika Srpska, which is made up mostly of Serbs.
 Despite the Dayton Peace Accords, the two entities have not grown closer together. Bosnian Serb leaders often refer to Bosnia-Herzegovina as a failed state and raise the possibility of secession.
 Srebrenica has the look and feel of a ghost town. A popular spa town when it was part of Yugoslavia, the city’s economy and tourism has not recovered from the war. Only 5,000 of its former 36,000 inhabitants now live there.
 For my generation, shaped by the sight of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the West’s failure to act in Bosnia left a powerful legacy even though we were powerless to do anything about it at the time.
 It drove some of us, including me, into the frontline of politics.
 I was selected as a candidate in 1996 and entered the House of Commons as the Labour MP for Wimbledon in 1997.
 When I arrived, like many of my parliamentary colleagues elected at that time, I took a much more interventionist stance to world politics, starting with our support for the Nato air strikes in Kosovo.
 Three years after Srebrenica, Europe was again hosting a war, this one pitting the Kosovan Liberation Army (KLA) against the Serbian regime of Slobodan Miloševic. Nato’s intervention – without the backing of a UN Security Council Resolution – protected 1.8 million Kosovan Albanians who Miloševic had vowed to drive from their homes.

As the wartime background to the Arts Council illustrated, it’s difficult to disentangle cultural policy from other areas. Many of the policies most salient for cultural activity don’t always refer directly to it, education being a core example.
 Lee also expanded the parameters of the Arts Council, bringing forward the role of culture in tackling social exclusion and producing in 1966 the first White Paper on the arts, also the last for another 50 years.
 Wilson the tactician was alive to the political potential of popular culture, and this too prefigured an approach to valuing culture that would become increasingly prominent.
 The MBEs bestowed on The Beatles in 1965 provoked the ire of former recipients, several of whom returned their medals. War hero George Reed said that giving the award to the band meant “its meaning seems to be worthless”.
 But amidst the debate it was noted that The Beatles were a major export for Britain, at a time when its industry overall was struggling somewhat. Wilson’s office referred to “the work these young people have done to diminish juvenile delinquency – especially on Merseyside”.
 Economic contributions and social cohesion, then, emerged alongside a more explicit strand of ‘cultural policy’. In the end, John Lennon also demonstrated the limits of politicians’ capacity for corralling pop culture and in 1969 sent back his own MBE “in protest against Britain’s involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam and against _Cold Turkey_ slipping down the charts”.
 The tensions between the patrician and the popular may have taken a little longer to unwind, but instrumental values of culture percolated through national and local government, even as the post-war consensus ran into the sand in the late 1970s and Margaret Thatcher’s government of the 1980s turned towards free-markets and away from direct intervention.
 Local authorities, many of them in conflict with the national Conservative government, turned to culture as a means of regeneration – to provide employment, and drive local industry.
 Glasgow leveraged the European Commission’s City of Culture award in 1990 to similar ends while John Major’s government formed the Department of National Heritage in 1992.
 After 18 years in the wilderness – and battling the Conservatives from town halls – Labour’s return to power brought the instrumental approach more fully into central government, presenting it as less a matter of subsidy than of investment.
 This turn from ‘culture’ to ‘creative industries’ was made explicit by the re- tooling of the Department for National Heritage as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
 This has played out through the detailed hashing out of policy and fraught debates about the limits of the market – in ticket touting, for instance – and concerns about the intrinsic value of art for art’s sake. The glitzier end of the process has had its ups and downs as well, from the soft power synergy of Cool Britannia to the awkwardness of Chumbawamba emptying a bucket of ice over John Prescott at the Brit Awards, and the lengthy travails of the Millennium Dome, ultimately resurrected as the O2 venue.
 For all these difficulties, and although deindustrialisation means that issues of access and disparities between major cities and smaller towns remain salient, the New Labour years helped to embed culture within the broader economy. The apotheosis of this trajectory was perhaps the 2012 Olympic Ceremony foregrounding the UK’s popular culture, alongside the likes of the NHS, as emblematic of its national achievements.
 As political scientist John Street has put it, “cultural policy – like all policy – is about allocating scarce resources and resolving competing demands”.
 Navigating this in a crisis as simultaneously far-ranging and acute as Covid-19 remains fraught. “I guess everyone’s a Keynesian in the foxhole,” conceded economist Robert Lucas – usually a sceptic about government intervention – in 2008.
 And so it has proved, with industries across the board turning to the state. Cultural industries are no exception and, from ballet to rock to panto to stand-up comedy, rely on both venue infrastructure and a workforce heavily characterised by self-employment.
 So the furlough scheme pertains as well as Sunak’s arts package. In one sense, Covid-19 has rendered Sir Humphrey and Jim Hacker’s debate moot. All of culture needs support at the moment. It has also shown, though, that economic and intrinsic value in the arts are hard to unpick, and that distinctions between social, economic and cultural policy are more diffuse than ever.

 As for masks, Kurtz said everyone needs to be respectful of the agency of individuals, whether or not they choose to wear a mask.
 “Right now I think as long as we honor peoples’ social distancing, and I know I’m going to get push-back on this, but everybody is not in the same spot right now,” Kurtz said. “I get calls from people who say we need to be in full mask, I get calls from people who say no mask, and I guess what I tell people is that is somebody’s individual choice. If someone wants to wear a mask, let them wear a mask. Don’t make fun of them because they’re wearing a mask. My wife wears a mask. She went into a grocery store and some guy made fun of her for wearing a mask, and that’s defenseless, that truly is… People need their space, and if you’re in a grocery store or a (a different) store, and they have those lines on the floor, follow them.”

In 1982, an episode of Yes Minister featured a debate about arts funding between civil servant and establishment paragon Sir Humphrey Appleby and his more technocratic and demotic political counterpart, Jim Hacker. "Subsidy is about education, preserving the pinnacles of our civilization," stresses Sir Humphrey. "Let us choose what we subsidise by the extent of popular demand," counters Hacker. "It's democratic." Covid-19, of course, has pulled the rug out from under Sir Humphrey's beloved opera and Hacker's preferred option of cinema alike, along with all points in between. As the role of the state in all aspects of national life has been reconfigured on a historic scale, it has also thrown the broader role of cultural policy into stark relief. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's rescue package of £1.57 billion is large by any measure (more than 20% of the total departmental spend by DCMS in 2016-17, including the BBC and lottery funding, for instance). Such is the size of the crisis that this still won't prevent losses within the cultural sector. The threat to cultural activity, on top of the way people have turned to cultural outputs to see them through the lockdown, are in one sense unprecedented. But they also reveal tensions and debates in debates in cultural policy that long predate Yes Minister. Prime minister Boris Johnson is fond of referring to Britain's capacity for "world beating" responses and, notwithstanding that this general tendency has older roots, at least some elements of this view can be traced back to the Second World War, especially given Johnson's Churchill fixation. As it happens, the cultural industries are a sector where Britain really does excel - it's less easy to make that case for some of Johnson's other claims - and elements of our current arts support infrastructure has its origins in the war, also the last time there was such a wholesale reshaping of the public provision. While the BBC had obtained its Royal Charter in 1926, with a radio license in effect from 1923, the war brought the government into the arts themselves, as well as the means of broadcasting them. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts was founded by a charity in 1939 to boost morale and provide work for touring artists during the war and when the treasury of the wartime coalition government agreed to fund it in 1940, the rationale included the "preservation in wartime of the highest standards in the arts of music, drama and painting". It also spoke of "widespread provision" and support for more general enjoyment of the arts. But the emphasis was rather patrician - leaning towards Sir Humphrey over Jim Hacker. The focus on bringing the 'fine arts' to the population at large carried through into the post-war Arts Council of Great Britain, the forerunner of today's Arts Councils and chaired initially by John Maynard Keynes, who had been in post as the chair of CEMA since 1942. The foundations of modern arts funding, then, were part of the post-war settlement, if perhaps more for the people than of them. The preference for high art over entertainment prefigured the future terms of ideological debate in cultural policy - how to balance fostering 'excellence' (and how to define that) against promoting access to the arts, and encouraging a plurality of voices. The 1960s saw the accelerating breakdown of deference within post-war society, and popular culture making a grab for high-art status as the likes of The Beatles breached boundaries between mass commercial appeal and serious critical acclaim. This was of a piece with the Harold Wilson's government overall, with Jennie Lee as the first minister for the arts and the introduction of the Open University. As the wartime background to the Arts Council illustrated, it's difficult to disentangle cultural policy from other areas. Many of the policies most salient for cultural activity don't always refer directly to it, education being a core example. Lee also expanded the parameters of the Arts Council, bringing forward the role of culture in tackling social exclusion and producing in 1966 the first White Paper on the arts, also the last for another 50 years.

The glitzier end of the process has had its ups and downs as well, from the soft power synergy of Cool Britannia to the awkwardness of Chumbawamba emptying a bucket of ice over John Prescott at the Brit Awards, and the lengthy travails of the Millennium Dome, ultimately resurrected as the O2 venue. For all these difficulties, and although deindustrialisation means that issues of access and disparities between major cities and smaller towns remain salient, the New Labour years helped to embed culture within the broader economy. The apotheosis of this trajectory was perhaps the 2012 Olympic Ceremony foregrounding the UK's popular culture, alongside the likes of the NHS, as emblematic of its national achievements. As political scientist John Street has put it, "cultural policy - like all policy - is about allocating scarce resources and resolving competing demands". Navigating this in a crisis as simultaneously far-ranging and acute as Covid-19 remains fraught. "I guess everyone's a Keynesian in the foxhole," conceded economist Robert Lucas - usually a sceptic about government intervention - in 2008. And so it has proved, with industries across the board turning to the state. Cultural industries are no exception and, from ballet to rock to panto to stand-up comedy, rely on both venue infrastructure and a workforce heavily characterised by self-employment. So the furlough scheme pertains as well as Sunak's arts package. In one sense, Covid-19 has rendered Sir Humphrey and Jim Hacker's debate moot. All of culture needs support at the moment. It has also shown, though, that economic and intrinsic value in the arts are hard to unpick, and that distinctions between social, economic and cultural policy are more diffuse than ever.

The problem of course is that NAD tends to be more decorative than substantive protection against false industry claims. As a self-regulatory apparatus, the organization is used by industry as a form of wrist slap theater to justify regulatory apathy at the FCC and FTC. Most penalties for false advertising are negligible, and by the time these complaints wind their way through the dispute process, the ads in question have often already had their intended impact. So while Verizon has agreed to pull these latest ads, there's nothing stopping them from doing it all over again a few months down the road with a few tweaks, starting the cycle all over again.

Srebrenica is a small town in Europe, located in the easternmost part of Republika Srpska, one of the two entities which make up Bosnia-Herzegovina, near the border with Serbia. As the crow flies, it lies just about halfway between Bologna and Bucharest. Over a handful of days, from July 11, 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically killed there by the Bosnian Serb army under the command of Ratko Mladic, on the direction of Radovan Karadžic, in what was at that time a UN 'safe haven'. It was the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. Twenty five years on from the massacre, what do we see? Mladic and Karadzic (who received part of his medical training as a psychiatrist at Columbia University in New York) are serving life sentences following their convictions by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. And what of the region itself? Serbia is applying to join the European Union. Bosnia- Herzegovina is an independent state, still under partial international oversight, comprised of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - home mostly to Bosniaks and Croats - and the Republika Srpska, which is made up mostly of Serbs. Despite the Dayton Peace Accords, the two entities have not grown closer together. Bosnian Serb leaders often refer to Bosnia-Herzegovina as a failed state and raise the possibility of secession. Srebrenica has the look and feel of a ghost town. A popular spa town when it was part of Yugoslavia, the city's economy and tourism has not recovered from the war. Only 5,000 of its former 36,000 inhabitants now live there. For my generation, shaped by the sight of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the West's failure to act in Bosnia left a powerful legacy even though we were powerless to do anything about it at the time. It drove some of us, including me, into the frontline of politics. I was selected as a candidate in 1996 and entered the House of Commons as the Labour MP for Wimbledon in 1997. When I arrived, like many of my parliamentary colleagues elected at that time, I took a much more interventionist stance to world politics, starting with our support for the Nato air strikes in Kosovo. Three years after Srebrenica, Europe was again hosting a war, this one pitting the Kosovan Liberation Army (KLA) against the Serbian regime of Slobodan Miloševic. Nato's intervention - without the backing of a UN Security Council Resolution - protected 1.8 million Kosovan Albanians who Miloševic had vowed to drive from their homes. That was a defining moment in post-war international relations. For the first time, Nato intervened not in response to a threat against a member state but to avert a humanitarian emergency - out of a duty to protect. Subsequently, military interventions were sanctioned to protect no-fly zones in northern Iraq and in Sierra Leone. With the Iraq war, much of the moral authority of using force to protect human rights was dissipated. France and the UK later intervened to prevent the annihilation of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Benghazi in Libya in 2011. But as in Iraq, regime change followed with all the unintended consequences that have made western government recoil from such interventions ever since. Even in the face of chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime, or systematic human rights violations in Yemen, the West has failed to act. Where is there now a western government which will rise to stay the hand of the executioner, or stem the slaughter of innocents? In Myanmar we have witnessed the morbid paradox of a Nobel Laureate defend her country against allegations of genocide over its treatment of its Rohingya people. Closer to home, just a few hundred kilometres from Srebrenica, Kosovo president Hashim Thaci and nine other former separatist fighters have just been indicted on a range of crimes against humanity during and after Kosovo's 1998-99 independence war with Serbia. Although Thaci is no longer considered part of the talks on account of the charges, the EU-facilitated Kosovo-Serbia dialogue is about to restart. Outside Europe, the big power brokers of world politics seem uninterested in the rule of international law. The "responsibility to protect" was finally adopted by the UN in 2005 in the wake of the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda. Will it be of any consequence to leaders such as Xi Jinping, Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin? As Europeans, who value respect for the rule of law and human rights, we should nevertheless take courage from the progress that has been made. Since the Srebrenica genocide, there has been a growth both in the range of international criminal courts and in the war crimes cases. Much of this has been driven by lawyers and institutions from the EU and EU member states. Twenty five years on, the witness we bear to the Srebrenica genocide must make us continue to fight for all who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity to be brought to justice - whoever, and wherever they may be. We must also work continuously to restore respect for international law and to give life and effect to the responsibility to protect. It is a part of Europe's mission in the world that must never be abandoned. If not us, then who? If not now, then when? Roger Casale, Labour MP for Wimbledon from 1997 to 2005, is the founder of the pro-EU campaigning group New Europeans.

The idea for the Glades has actually been around longer than many Houstonians have been alive, part of the park's first master plan in the 1920s by the landscape architects Hare and Hare. They conceived the area as a "garden" with an oval-shaped path around a building that could have been a plant conservatory. Had that plan been carried out, Memorial Park would be a much different space today.

Krause must hide his anxiety from young men studying him for signs of it. We see it, though, like the quick burst of sobbing when he gets a couple of seconds alone. In his cabin, far beyond the point of exhaustion, Krause is bemused at the breaking of a pencil point on a notepad, when trying to compose a last message to his convoy. Even the demonstration of Krause’s prime characteristic, his Christian-soldiering — or rather, sailoring — isn’t boring. There’s mildness in the way Krause rebukes the crew hurraying over the successful depth-charging of a Nazi sub. He isn’t a starchy preacher. Hanks’ voice is quiet to the brink of inaudibility, when he reads that noble passage from the Book of Common Prayer meant for burial at sea. (The scene is not too noble to watch, though; there’s grim pathos in the way the third body dumped over the side becomes tangled in the American flag that shrouds it.)

She broadly concurs with the general consensus that her uncle is a narcissist who is barely capable of feeling any concern or sympathy for anyone other than himself. But I think, in the light of some of his recent statements, that it seems to go beyond that.
 In particular, consider Trump’s repeated assertion that if only people would stop getting tested for the coronavirus then there would be fewer instances of that virus.
 His ‘people’ tried to pass this off at a joke when he trotted it out at the disastrous Tulsa rally but he keeps reiterating it.
 Now the cognitive functions of anyone over the age of about four will tell you that something doesn’t go away just because you don’t know about it, but what if one were an actual solipsist?
 What if one believed that the only thing that’s real is your own consciousness and that as such, the only things that exist at any given time are you and the things you’re aware of?
 Might you not therefore express the desire that people should stop finding out about this disease (and, moreover, stop telling you about it) because it’s only the fact that you know about it that’s making it happen?
 What’s perhaps the most alarming thing to contemplate (apart from the fact that the guy who has the nuclear codes to destroy the world might be less than entirely convinced that the world actually exists in the first place) is that Trump is not, in this, massively out of step with a great swathe of the population as a whole, on both ends of the political spectrum.
 The idea that one can ‘believe’ something _into_ existence (or indeed ignore something else _out_ of existence), that faith and fervour alone are sufficient to bend the fabric of reality, has been driving a lot of the political energy on both the left and right wings over last few years.
 Not much else can explain the Corbyntologists’ eagerness to go into last year’s general election confident of victory despite their beloved leader’s personal polling barely scraping into double digits at the time (I remember reading tweets by devout Corbynians back in November making casual reference to “when we win the election”; not “if”; “when”).
 There may have been factors other than sheer belief (and wilful ignorance of the facts) propelling the momentum towards Brexit back in 2016 but there’s literally nothing else which explains the continuing enthusiasm (such as it is) for the doomed project in the present day, now that even the government’s own spokesbeings are cheerfully acknowledging the massive economic and social toll it will take (while insisting, of course, that they’d been saying this for five years).
 Just because the leader of the free world doesn’t understand how reality works is no excuse for the rest of us.
