With the clock ticking and despite understandable reservations about Balotelli’s previous behaviour, Rodgers came around to the idea of signing the then 24-year-old who put pen to paper on this day in 2014.
 Rodgers was renowned for his man-management skills and so it was hoped he could get Balotelli to toe the line - despite the player's rather chequered history which included lighting fireworks in his bathroom, throwing darts as Manchester City trainees, fighting with team-mates on the training ground and breaking club curfews during a two-and-a-half year stay at the Etihad.
 And at 6ft3in, Balotelli was blessed with pace and strength, had the ability to torment defenders, score incredible goals and play with a real swagger. He cost just £16million from AC Milan too and on paper he looked like everything Liverpool needed.
 "It was pretty clear to see that, strikers I've always worked with, Mario Balotelli didn't fit my style," Rodgers said back in June.
 "But one thing I will say about Mario is that he has all the talent, and he genuinely has.
 "He should be one of the top three strikers in world football. He has everything. It's the difference between talent and working talent."
 In 2012, City manager Roberto Mancini also said: "If Mario is not one of the best players in the world it will be his fault because he has everything."
 Ultimately, Liverpool gambled on their belief that Rodgers would unlock Balotelli's potential, get him to work hard and showcase his outrageous abilities.

This design heats the air in a giant enclosed canopy that surrounds a gargantuan central tower. The tower acts as an escape chimney for the hot air created in the canopy. Since heat rises, the hot air will push its way out of the canopy and up through the tube-like central tower. Turbines are placed within the tower to harness the energy of the updraft and generate electricity. While these towers and their canopies need to be built on a massive scale--think larger than most New York City skyscrapers--it is important that they serve a dual purpose, and since the canopy that heats the air acts as a gigantic greenhouse, hundreds of acres of cash crops can be planted within, increasing the power plant's overall utility. Australian company EnviroMission Limited is on track to develop the first large-scale solar tower project in the deserts of Arizona in the United States.

Brisbane will part ways with head coach Anthony Seibold as soon as Wednesday with the embattled boss agreeing to leave the NRL club.
 The Broncos are expected to confirm Seibold's departure once a severance package can be finalised.
 Assistant coach Peter Gentle is expected to once again lead the club for Friday's match against the Sydney Roosters, as he has done for the past two games with Seibold in isolation after leaving the club's COVID bubble to deal with a personal matter.
 The 45-year-old made a brief return to Red Hill on Tuesday morning after his isolation period ended, in what may well be his last appearance at the club's headquarters.
 AAP has sought comment from Seibold's management and the Broncos.
 Seibold's reign at the Broncos lasted less than two seasons of a five-year contract.
 The 2018 Dally M coach of the year was given the lengthy deal by the Broncos board after his maiden NRL campaign as South Sydney coach.
 He led the Broncos to the finals in 2019 but a 58-0 hiding by Parramatta ended the club's campaign in turbulent fashion.
 In 2020, Seibold found himself increasingly isolated in Brisbane as the club went on a run of 12 losses from its last 13 matches to slip to second-last on the ladder.
 On Monday the club's biggest private shareholder Paul Murphy said the Broncos' fall from grace under Seibold had been tough to endure.
 "It becomes like a disease. If you get cancer, you've got to treat it, but they haven't cut it out," Murphy told reporters.
 Off-field dramas have also plagued the once-mighty club which has come under fire for its recruitment and culture.
 Club legend Kevin Walters and former North Queensland coach Paul Green are the frontrunners to replace Seibold.

In either case, the "Domestic Energy Promotion Act of 2011" seems like the better option of the two bills being pursued.

Yes, oil is tried and true, and we would all like to see prices at the pump come down.  But the U.S. is at a critical crossroads where alternative energy infrastructure must be implemented NOW, not later.  By continuing to favor the oil industry over alternatives, in a few decades, pump prices will be out of the price range of most average Americans, and alternative fuels will hold price advantage.  Unfortunately, if the fueling infrastructure isn't in place, then the transition will be anything but smooth, and with energy infrastructure historically being a public sector endeavor, that means our tax money should be funding alternative fuel infrastructure development, instead of subsidizing antiquated oil infrastructure and companies that don't even need the subsidies!

__Carla Qualtrough is sworn in as Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion during the cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa. November 20, 2019.//Carla Qualtrough est assermentée comme ministre de l'Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l'Accessibilité durant la cérémonie d’assermentation du Conseil des ministres à Rideau Hall, à Ottawa. 20 novembre 2019.
 The federal government is focused on getting Canadians back to work.
 MyTriportNow had the opportunity to speak with the Federal Minister of Employment, Workforce Development, and Disability Inclusion Carla Qualtrough this morning about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Canadians.
 We also spoke with her about what the federal government is planning to do to help recover from the financial crisis and hardship the country has seen this year.
 Qualtrough says the main focus of parliament right now is to get as many Canadians back to work as possible.
 “We do want people working. We want you to go work if you can and if you have the opportunity.”
 “We've learned from the CERB and we learned from the challenges we faced in March getting everybody into Employment Insurance and we think we've come up with the right balance of support and getting people to work, by getting many people into EI into the end of September and creating a kind of parallel benefits for people who despite the changes to the EI system, won't get in.”
 Qualtrough also says one of her main focuses has been to support the more vulnerable people during the current health crisis.
 “It's a personal passion of mine that we don't leave people, particularly vulnerable behind in this pandemic. We're now at the point where we have legislation in place that creates a supplement for about 1.7 million Canadians with disabilities, whether you're getting the disability tax credit, you're on Canada Pension Plan Disability, you're a veteran receiving disability benefits. If you're in one of these federal programs, you'll receive a one- time payment of 600 dollars which is non-taxable and non-reportable.”
 She says while the country has taken some good steps forward when it comes to getting people back into the workforce, there’s still a long road ahead.
 “We've got a long way to go to get back to pre-COVID unemployment rates. We've had some success as a country in getting people back to work. At its highest, there were about 8.5 million people on the CERB and now there's about 4 to 4.5 million on CERB. So we have evidence to show that about 4.1 million people have left the CERB and gone back to work or had more hours of work,” explains Qualtrough.
 She adds that the federal government has heard concerns from citizens about a possible tax hike to help recover financially, but adds that isn’t something that’s on the agenda.
 “Canadians are justified in wanting to know what the plan is and so we're going to layout that plan on September 23rd and just share our vision for building back better and really signal how we are going to do this. The Prime Minister has said it won't be done through tax hikes so we're going to look at how we can do that in a responsible way.”
 “The reality is people have to pay their mortgages and their bills and we didn't want people losing their homes because we asked them to stop working. We didn't want bankruptcies, we wanted to help as many businesses as possible.”

Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley wasted no time upending the disastrous foreign policy enforced during the Obama administration. When compared to the successes under President Trump's watch, Haley argued, former Vice President Joe Biden shouldn't stand a chance.
 "Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first," Haley said. "Donald Trump has always put America first. He has earned four more years as president."
 Having fought to defend America's interests and push back against the UN's anti-Israel bias, Haley knows firsthand that the UN is a place "where dictators, murderers, and thieves denounce America…and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills."
 Trump, she noted, put an end to all that.
 "With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do," she said. "We stood up for America…and we stood against our enemies."
 The same can be said of North Korea and Iran. Where Obama and Biden appeased, Trump stood his ground.
 "Obama and Biden let North Korea threaten America. President Trump rejected that weakness, and we passed the toughest sanctions on North Korea in history."
 "Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash," she continued. "President Trump did the right thing and ripped up the Iran nuclear deal."
 Haley predicted that a Biden-Harris administration would be "much, much worse."
 "Last time, Joe’s boss was Obama…this time, it would be Pelosi, Sanders, and the Squad. Their vision for America is socialism. And we know that socialism has failed everywhere."
 Biden, she said for emphasis, "would be a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain, and abandon our values."
 His track record would be just as bad here at home. Just look at the riots that have erupted across the country in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. Democrats, she argued, have turned a "blind eye" to the riots and rage infecting the U.S.
 "The black cops who’ve been shot in the line of duty – they matter," Haley reasoned. "The black small business owners who’ve watched their life’s work go up in flames – they matter. The black kids who’ve been gunned down on the playground – their lives matter too. And their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets."

PARIS — At BP, 10,000 jobs. At Lufthansa, 22,000. At Renault, 14,600.
 When European countries ordered businesses to shutter and employees to stay home as the coronavirus spread, governments took radical steps to shield workers from the prospect of mass joblessness, extending billions to businesses to keep people employed.
 The layoffs are coming anyway.
 A tsunami of job cuts is about to hit Europe as companies prepare to carry out sweeping downsizing plans to offset a collapse in business from the outbreak. Government-backed furlough schemes that have helped keep around one-third of Europe’s workforce financially secure are set to unwind in the coming months.
 As many as 59 million jobs are at risk of cuts in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, especially in industries like transportation and retail, according to a study by McKinsey & Co.
 Governments are warning that millions will soon lose paychecks, and the European Central Bank last week said unemployment was likely to surge and stay high even when a recovery from the pandemic unfolds.
 “Europe has been successful at dampening the initial effects of the crisis,” said John Hurley, senior research manager at Eurofound, the research arm of the European Union. “But in all likelihood, unemployment is going to come home to roost, especially when the generous furlough programs start to ease off,” he said.
 “There’s going to be a shakeout,” he added, “and it’s going to be fairly ugly.”
 Compared with the United States, which lost more than 20 million jobs in April alone, the furlough programs in the EU have prevented unemployment from going off the charts. Germany, France, Denmark and Britain are among countries that have employed so-called short-work schemes, effectively nationalizing the paychecks of about 60 million private-sector employees.
 But even before a recent resurgence of coronavirus cases, the pandemic’s economic damage was growing, and it now appears those expensive government programs only postponed the pain for some workers. Corporate giants and retail companies operating well below capacity since the start of the crisis will now pivot to slashing tens of thousands of positions in autumn and through next year. Some companies figure the disruption is the best time to move forward on long-contemplated downsizing.
 Airbus, BP, Renault, Lufthansa, Air France, Debenhams department store chain, Bank of Ireland, retailer W.H. Smith and even McLaren Group, which includes the Formula One racing team, along with countless smaller businesses, are among those planning cuts that will sweep factory workers, retail employees and high-paid white-collar workers into the ranks of the unemployed.
 The layoffs are mounting even as Europe has flashed signs of recovery amid a historic contraction in growth rates. In Germany, business and consumer confidence is growing, while manufacturing activity across the eurozone bounced back to growth in July. The euro is strengthening against the dollar as investment flows into Europe.
 The scale and speed of the cutbacks underscores the challenge facing leaders as they recalibrate their approach to limiting the pandemic’s damage.
 For one thing, the cost of Europe’s support programs has been mounting. European leaders recently agreed to a landmark 750 billion euro stimulus package on top of hundreds of billions spent since the start of the crisis, ballooning national debts and deficits.
 About 9 million European workers, up to one-fifth of those currently enrolled in the short-work programs, are in what German bank Allianz has dubbed “zombie jobs” — positions in the auto and airline industries, restaurants, shops and hotels and other sectors ill-equipped to confront shifting consumer behavior. Many of these jobs are still on the books almost solely because of government subsidies, the bank said.
 “The programs in Europe are more generous than in the United States, but they won’t last forever,” said Simon Tilford, an author of a Center for European Reform report on the economic risks of the pandemic.
 In the meantime, governments “are going to face a difficult choice about continuing to subsidize workers in sectors where there is a question about the long-term future,” including autos and aerospace, he added.
 Employers will soon face other financial pressures as emergency benefits adopted when the virus was raging in the spring come to a close. In Britain, a moratorium on forfeiture of commercial properties because of unpaid rent — effectively allowing firms to delay rent payments — ends in September. In Germany, a rule allowing companies in distress to avoid filing for bankruptcy will also begin phasing out in September.
 Among the U.K. businesses that have already announced cuts, British Airways, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic will shed a total of nearly 20,000 jobs. Boots, Pret a Manger and a phalanx of other high street retailers and food shops will lay off at least 15,000 in the coming weeks and months. At BP, 10,000 office- based positions will go, most by the end of the year. Millions of others on precarious temporary and “on-call” contracts are also at risk.
 Governments are moving to ensure that rising joblessness doesn’t turn into a quagmire of long-term unemployment. Britain and other countries are expanding access to benefits and investing billions in programs to train workers in industries that are hiring, whether in chemical engineering, truck driving or home care.
 Britain will invest $1 billion into job centers and double the number of work coaches to 27,000 to help benefit claimants back into work. France is recruiting thousands of new counselors to give job seekers what the government says will be more personalized direction.
 Adecco, Europe’s largest temporary employment agency, has been amping up its retraining.
 “We see a huge wave of restructuring coming, especially in Germany, France and the United States,” said Christophe Catoir, Adecco’s president for France and Northern Europe. “In September, October and November we will probably register an additional 1 million unemployed in France alone — not just people in short- term work, but high-skilled people.”

Africa is a prime location for generating geothermal energy. "For a long time, Kenya was dependent on hydro energy," stated James Kiiru, Commercial Attache, Embassy of the Republic of Kenya. "The challenge is if there is no rain, the supply can't be guaranteed, so the government is looking into alternative sources of power." Kenya was the first African country to really expand on its geothermal resources. With three plants, built by the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), further expansion at all locations are in the works. Kenya received a $293 million loan from Japan and a $94 billion loan from China for plant expansion.

Moksh Chitkara had been living in California with his parents for the past five months, but Sunday he boarded a flight to Austin to return to the University of Texas.
   
 Like many UT students, Chitkara will have most of his classes online this semester because of the coronavirus, but one is in-person. His parents asked him repeatedly not to go, even calling the university to request that it move all classes online to keep him at home. He plans to stay in Austin until in- person classes are supposed to end around Thanksgiving. But right now, that seems like a best-case scenario. Chitkara is prepared to return to California if classes move completely online -- which he sees as a strong possibility.
   
 "I feel like within three weeks of the semester starting, they're going to make, if not all classes online, a significant number of classes online," he said.
   
 Classes begin Wednesday, and many will be online. But extenuating factors -- such as a high number of COVID-19 cases, lack of coronavirus testing supplies, or a student or faculty death -- could force the university to close all classroom doors as it did in March when the pandemic arrived in Texas.
   
 But much has changed since the spring, said Dr. Amy Young, vice dean of professional practice for UT's Dell Medical School and chief clinical officer for UT Health Austin. When the school moved to remote instruction in March, only three coronavirus cases had been confirmed by city officials, including the wife of then-UT President Gregory L. Fenves. Now, although the city is reporting anywhere from 150 to 300 positive cases per day, UT officials feel confident about reopening classrooms on a small scale, Young said.
   
 "We know a lot more about the disease," she said. "We know how quickly it spreads. We know the preventive measures that have been shown to be effective, and I think that where we are as a community, and where we are as a country and as health providers, is really understanding how to go about our work and our business and our lives while trying to maintain the safest possible environment."
   
 Administrators have been planning all summer for how to do just that. By limiting in-person activity, requiring face masks on campus and preparing to test up to 5,000 people a week, officials hope the university can continue to function, at least partially, in-person.
   
 Officials have mapped out five levels of campus operations, with one being totally open and five being closed. UT had hoped to open the fall semester at level three, with campus buildings open and many classes online. But Arthur Markman, a psychology professor and head of the university's fall semester planning committee, said the university is at level four -- with most classes temporarily online and careful operation of residence halls and dining facilities.
   
 "The real focus was on delivering those parts of a UT education that really needed to be in person and not necessarily trying to jam as many students onto the campus as possible," Markman said. "We recognize that we're in the middle of a pandemic. And so we want to do a great job of educating our students and making sure that they are able to get the skills that they need and the access to the equipment that they need, while at the same time doing the best job we can of keeping everybody safe."
   
 At Texas A&M; University and other public universities across the state, administrators have similar plans to offer students a menu of classes online, in-person or in hybrid formats, while also requiring masks in public spaces, gearing up for on-site coronavirus testing, and limiting classroom capacities to allow for social distancing.
   
 In Austin, St. Edward's University plans to conduct most classes virtually, with certain experiential courses -- such as research, sports medicine and the arts -- conducted on-campus in a physically distanced manner. Concordia University Texas will offer most upper-level courses online until mid- September, with many lower-level courses still meeting in a physically distanced way on campus.
   
 Most schools have issued their plans for the fall semester with the caveat that things could change based on local health conditions. But some, like Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, hope to avoid another sudden change by offering all instruction online for the entire fall semester. In a letter to the community in June, Huston-Tillotson President and CEO Colette Pierce Burnette said the risks are too great to host an in-person semester, and all students would receive a tablet computer to allow them to continue their education online.
   
 Expecting cases
   
 It's highly unlikely that any school in the U.S. will come out of the fall semester without any coronavirus cases, said Scott Schneider, an Austin-based attorney with the Husch Blackwell law firm and a consultant on higher education issues.
   
 "There's not a place in the country where the virus is under control," he said. "So if the fantasy is, 'we're going to reopen; we're not going to have cases,' despite everything that's going on in both the local community of the institution and where these young people are coming from, that's a complete fantasy."
   
 Some universities will do better than others, Schneider said, adding that smaller campuses might be better equipped to handle the pandemic than large ones.
   
 "Maybe some of it might just be dumb luck, but some of it is because they've been super, super thoughtful over the course of the summer and have developed really robust protocols, and they will succeed in this space, and then some won't," he said. "For the most part, everyone I've been talking to has a plan. But to quote Mike Tyson, 'Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.' "
   
 That was the case at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which moved classes online last week after initially beginning in-person instruction Aug. 10. The school reported at least four clusters of COVID-19 cases in student living spaces. The school, which has an enrollment of about 30,000 students, reported 130 positive cases over the past week.
   
 Flexibility
   
 UT epidemiologists project between 82 and 183 students could arrive on campus infected with the coronavirus.
   
 The projection, released Friday by UT's COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, estimated that the prevalence of the virus, or the percentage of a population estimated to be infected, among returning students will be 0.5%, higher than the prevalence in the Austin-Round Rock area. But it would be expected to be lower if students follow university guidance to self-isolate for two weeks before arriving in Austin.
   
 The report estimated that slightly fewer than half of the university's 51,000 students will come to campus and surrounding neighborhoods.
   
 Markman said a UT advisory group will constantly monitor the coronavirus situation and suggest adjustments to operations as needed. Circumstances that could trigger a discussion about a change in operations include local government action, a lack of virus testing supplies, areas to isolate, an increasing number of community cases, or the death of a student, faculty member or staff member from COVID-19.
   
 No one event will trigger a closure of UT, Markman said. Rather, officials have recognized nearly 20 areas to monitor both on campus and in the community. Based on the circumstances, UT could increase cleaning or social distancing measures, temporarily suspend classes, reduce occupancy in buildings, or close residence halls in response, though Markman said the university could keep residence halls open if classes move all online.
   
 UT's planning committee is watching what is happening at other universities as well, Markman said. He hopes the planning UT has done will diminish the chances of widespread disruption because of the virus.
   
 "I think that gives us a good chance," he said.

He was searching for an elite option to challenge Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert, however the manager suffered a blow when Alexis Sanchez spurned Liverpool's advances and went to Arsenal.
 Next the focus turned to Queens Park Rangers’ Loic Remy with the Reds triggering his £8.5million release clause.
 It looked like a smart piece of business for a proven top-flight goal scorer but the deal for the Frenchman collapsed on medical grounds.
 Suddenly, Liverpool were back to square one.
 Third on their list was Swansea City’s Wilfried Bony with the Ivorian frontman keen to make the move to Anfield.
 Chief executive Ian Ayre held talks with his representatives but the £19million asking price – coupled with wage demands in excess of £100,000 per week – meant it went no further.
 Aston Villa’s Christian Benteke also came under consideration before Liverpool made ambitious enquiries about the availability of stellar names such as Radamel Falcao, Edinson Cavani and Karim Benzema who were playing for Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid at the time - but nothing came to fruition.
 With the September 1 transfer deadline looming and Liverpool running out of options, they considered Samuel Eto’o as a possible stop-gap signing in the knowledge that Belgium international frontman Divock Origi, a £10million purchase from Lille, would be arriving at Anfield the following summer.
 However, snapping up the veteran Cameroon striker was always going to be a last resort with Rodgers wanting a younger and more mobile frontman to compete for a first-team spot at the time.

Riese, who is skilled at detecting water quality and taste, has them try a number of different waters from different places in the world and of different qualities. They talk at length about something called TDS, which stands for "total dissolved solids." On his website, Riese explains that TDS "measures the mineral composition of any given water, which results in creating its own specific flavor profile and character. TDS levels determine how much sodium, magnesium, calcium and other minerals are present."
 According to Riese, TDS can determine how your water of choice will pair with your food of choice. On his “water menus,” TDS levels begin at under 10 milligrams on the low end and go all the way to 3,000 milligrams on the high end. The higher the TDS, the more minerals and taste the water will have.

 Dear Editor,
 As a new resident of the Arkansas Valley - and someone who relies on access to quality pharmaceuticals to treat a pre-existing condition - I was a bit nervous about moving so far away from the urban source of the drugs I rely upon. After living here for a month, I am increasingly grateful there has been no disruption at all when it comes to the medicines and prescriptions I needed. And that is because the distributors who supply and deliver medications and medical products from manufacturers to pharmacies and doctors - all over the state - have been working around the clock to make sure the supply chain won't break during the crisis. Thanks to these distributors, I am able to access the medicine I need to stay healthy.
 This recent experience showed me that there are more essential health care workers than just the ones you see in a doctor's office or hospital. Wholesale distributors are responsible for some of the most critical steps in our health care supply chain, and they've kept hospitals and pharmacies supplied during the pandemic. I saw firsthand what it looks like when they do their jobs well -stocked shelves in the pharmacy and doctors equipped with the supplies they need despite unprecedented demands. I hope they'll continue to make getting medicine seamless for us all, from our nation's biggest cities to Colorado's more remote, rural communities.
 Sincerely,
 Charlie Richardson

Landowners across NSW will be obliged to conduct more hazard-reduction burns on their properties and take an active role in bushfire preparation after the NSW government accepted all 76 recommendations of an independent bushfire inquiry.
 A trial will also be conducted of first-response aerial firefighting, which involves water bombers being deployed ahead of firefighters to reduce the intensity of blazes.
 Premier Gladys Berejiklian in January established the inquiry amid an unprecedented bushfire season in which 25 people died, almost 2500 homes were razed, more than 5.5 million hectares were burned and billions of animals perished.
 The inquiry leads, Professor Mary O'Kane and Dave Owens, handed the report to the NSW government in late July and it was published on Tuesday.
 Ms Berejiklian's government has agreed to support all 76 recommendations from the inquiry, including an enhanced role for landowners in the firefighting process.
 Landowners in fire-prone areas of NSW will be required to do their own hazard- reduction burns, and the NSW RFS will be permitted to intervene if they fail to do so.
 The report also recommends more hazard-reduction burns in closer proximity to endangered communities and the performance of hazard-reduction burns and water bombing at night.
 Indigenous cultural burning techniques will also be examined in greater detail.
 Firefighting authorities will also trial military-style water-bombing tactics and buy more medium-sized water bombing aircraft, while they have also been encouraged to update equipment, training and mental health support for firefighters.
 Targeted training for fire behaviour analysts in local weather effects, the training of more meteorologists in bushfire behaviour and weather training were also advised.
 "The release of this report is timely - we know our job is not done in recovering and rebuilding in the aftermath of those horrific bushfires," Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Tuesday.
 "We think of those who experienced the trauma and pain every day, and those who are still in recovery mode, recovering from that horrific bushfire season."
 Ms Berejiklian also admitted climate change had played a major role in the summer's fires, with authorities seeing things "they have never seen before in decades of firefighting".
 Among other recommendations are the establishment of a bushfire research facility in NSW and the creation of a bushfire-fighting technology fund.
 The government has also been advised to commission research into the efficacy of cattle grazing on vegetation as a hazard-reduction technique and to implement a police on injured wildlife, including guidance for firefighters on handling animals.
 Emergency Services Minister David Elliott told reporters the government had already tipped an additional $45 million into the state's firefighting response for the upcoming season, while the Rural Fire Service NSW had purchased 120 new fire trucks.
 He said he would enact further reforms ahead of this year's fire season if necessary and had six weeks to determine the rollout of the 76 inquiry recommendations, with some requiring the consent of federal government and others already in place.
 The government was open to purchasing more water-bombing aircraft.
 "Aviation has come of age when it comes to firefighting," Mr Elliott said.
 "What we have seen in NSW is that we've embraced it - when we talk about military tactics, that's all about making sure aviation assets can fly over a fireground quickly, early, with a maximum amount of retardant and water to drop."

POTTSVILLE — To try to make Schuylkill County Prison more bearable for employees and inmates, the county prison board voted Thursday in favor of installing a new heating-ventilating-air conditioning system in the facility.
 McClure Co. will do the work for $770,900, and do it quickly, county Engineer Lisa Mahall told the board.
 “They will have it installed” by Thanksgiving, Mahall said.
 The rapid work is partly due to the discovery of valves that will enable McClure to ensure connections more quickly, she said.
 County Administrator Gary R. Bender said the system will improve conditions in the prison. Since the humidity is high in the facility, which was built in the 1800s, although it has been modernized, the walkways are slippery, he said.
 President Judge William E. Baldwin, who chairs the board, said the new system will help protect employees and inmates from contracting the coronavirus. He said that prevention makes the system well worth its cost.
 “If we were to get the virus over there ... that would look cheap,” Baldwin said of the system’s price tag. “We need to protect the prison ... right now.”
 Warden David Wapinsky, whom the board promoted to the top position at the prison, said there are no coronavirus cases at the prison at this time.
 The recommendation will be made to the commissioners, whose next meeting will occur Wednesday. Since all three commissioners — Chairman Barron L. Hetherington, George F. Halcovage Jr. and Gary J. Hess — also are members of the prison board and voted to make the recommendation, passage is not expected to be a problem.
 Wapinsky said the new system should make the facility a better place for employees and inmates alike.
 The board also promoted Corrections Officer Corey Sabol to lieutenant and announced the sale, for $42.40, of scrap metal to Weiner Iron & Metal Corp., Pottsville.
 With respect to repair work, the board announced the following companies are performing the indicated jobs:
 ■ Johnson Controls had replaced numerous faulty smoke detectors.
 ■ Houck Services still is working on the wall repointing project. Crews are working on the interior wall on the north side of the prison and the exterior wall on the west side.
 ■ Albarell Electric Inc. converted a defective fluorescent light to an LED one in D Block and installed floodlight fixtures for the stairs in C Block.
 ■ Garland Communications Systems replaced two defective cameras and three intercom speakers.

Dear Editor,
   
 As a new resident of the Arkansas Valley - and someone who relies on access to quality pharmaceuticals to treat a pre-existing condition - I was a bit nervous about moving so far away from the urban source of the drugs I rely upon. After living here for a month, I am increasingly grateful there has been no disruption at all when it comes to the medicines and prescriptions I needed. And that is because the distributors who supply and deliver medications and medical products from manufacturers to pharmacies and doctors - all over the state - have been working around the clock to make sure the supply chain won't break during the crisis. Thanks to these distributors, I am able to access the medicine I need to stay healthy.
   
 This recent experience showed me that there are more essential health care workers than just the ones you see in a doctor's office or hospital. Wholesale distributors are responsible for some of the most critical steps in our health care supply chain, and they've kept hospitals and pharmacies supplied during the pandemic. I saw firsthand what it looks like when they do their jobs well -stocked shelves in the pharmacy and doctors equipped with the supplies they need despite unprecedented demands. I hope they'll continue to make getting medicine seamless for us all, from our nation's biggest cities to Colorado's more remote, rural communities.
   
 Sincerely,
   
 Charlie Richardson
   
 Olney Springs

While the natural heating and cooling from the earth's core is the oldest source of energy in history, the use of geothermal energy has been experiencing significant global growth within recent years. According to a report by the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA), the overall growth was 20 percent from 2005 to 2010. Another 70 nations have geothermal projects currently in the works, which is a 52 percent growth over the last three years.

A few days earlier, one of the agents, Nico Figueroa, had visited the retirement community and met Nguyen, who introduced himself as a security supervisor and a Homeland Security agent, Figueroa told investigators.
 The morning of the takedown, Nguyen greeted the State Department agents in “tactical raid gear, a thigh holster with a weapon and ballistic vest displaying an HSI badge,” Jones’ affidavit said. Nguyen told the agents he was assigned to a terrorism task force and had “worked all night,” but he “still wanted to show up to help execute the warrant,” Figueroa recalled him saying.
 Nguyen accompanied the State Department agents and was the first one through the door of the home they searched, the agents told Jones.
 “Agents would never allow an employee of a private security company, even if the company worked security at the facility being searched, to participate in executing a warrant in that manner,” Jones wrote.

The repatriation of one million displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar is still in the dark. All attempts to repatriate them safely to their homeland since they fled the Myanmar military's crimes against humanity and possible genocide three years ago have yielded no results.   The Myanmar government has failed to ensure that the nearly one million Rohingya refugees can safely return home.   On August 25 in 2017, the Myanmar military began a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against Rohingya Muslims involving mass killing, rape, and arson that forced over 740,000 to flee, most to the neighbouring Bangladesh, which was already hosting an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Rohingya refugees who had fled persecution dating back to the 1990s and after.     According to Human Rights Watch, The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in January 2020 imposed provisional measures on Myanmar to prevent genocide while it adjudicates alleged violations of the Genocide Convention. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in November 2019 began an investigation into Myanmar's forced deportation of Rohingya and related crimes against humanity. Myanmar has not complied with these international justice measures, has not permitted the United Nations to investigate grave crimes inside the country, nor conducted credible criminal investigations of its own into military atrocities.   "Myanmar's government should recognize that the terrible suffering it has caused the Rohingya won't disappear even amid a global pandemic," said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch said.   Some have been stranded at sea for weeks or months, with hundreds feared dead on boats that disappeared after Malaysia and Thailand illegally pushed them back using the Covid-19 pandemic as a justification.   Malaysia has detained arriving Rohingya refugees, denied them access to the UN refugee agency, and prosecuted some for illegal entry. Despite pledges, the Bangladesh government has not yet allowed UN officials to assist the over 300 Rohingya refugees rescued at sea and currently detained on the insecure silt island of Bhasan Char.   Myanmar has failed to address the root causes of widespread abuses against the Rohingya and has refused to create the necessary conditions for their safe, dignified, and voluntary return.

Bloomberg) -- The rally in gold, which surged to an all-time high two weeks ago, is showing signs of losing steam with hopes for a coronavirus treatment and signs of improving economies undercutting the metal’s appeal as a haven.
 Bullion posted back-to-back weekly losses for the first time since June, and on Monday headed for its third decline in four sessions. Gains in holdings of gold exchange-traded funds, a key driver of the metal’s surge this year, have also slowed. Inflows into SPDR Gold Shares, the top ETF backed by the metal, have been flat for four straight sessions, the longest run in two months.
 Gold has slipped about 7% from a record on Aug. 7, buffeted by improvements in some U.S. and Chinese economic indicators and speculation that efforts to expedite virus treatments could soon yield results. Investors are awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech Thursday at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Last week, Fed policy makers panned the yield-curve control idea that had helped bolster bullion.
 “Gold is continuing to consolidate following its rapid rise until the start of August,” Commerzbank AG analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note Monday. “‘This can also be seen in the wait-and-see attitude of ETF investors. The gold price is likely to find it hard to make further gains without any impetus in the form of ETF demand.”
 Bullion has risen about 27% this year, making it one of the best-performing commodities, on massive liquidity injections from central banks and governments trying to help economies to recover from the virus pandemic. But risk-on sentiment in broader markets is now eroding those gains, with equities surging to new highs and Treasury yields starting to recover this month.
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed Sunday that it had cleared a coronavirus treatment that involves blood plasma donated by people who’ve recovered from Covid-19. Separately, the Financial Times reported that Trump is considering whether to bypass normal U.S. regulatory standards to fast- track an experimental vaccine from the U.K. for use in the U.S. before November’s election. Meanwhile, Moderna Inc. said it plans to provide 80 million doses of its experimental coronavirus shot to the EU.
 The news on possible treatments “should be bullish for the dollar and bearish for gold,” Edward Meir, an analyst at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York, said by phone Monday.
 Meir expects the metal will trade will trade from $1,870 an ounce and to $2,000 for the time being, with markets weighing Jackson Hole, coronavirus cases and the dollar.
 “This is just sort of a brief setback, but we need to consolidate for a while” he said. “You do need to get some consolidation as investors evaluate what’s next.”
 Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1,929.06 at 1:51 p.m. in New York. Futures for December delivery fell 0.4% to settle at $1,939.20. In other precious metals, silver, platinum and palladium also declined.

Brunson returned to the U.S. from Turkey in October 2018, after imprisoning him during the purges in 2016 that followed an unsuccessful coup.
 'We had to get you back,' Trump said.
 American tourist Sam Goodwin, who was held for 63 days in Syria, sang the praises of Robert O'Brien and said he was happy that Trump promoted him to national security adviser. 'I can't say enough nice things about him,' Goodwin said, crediting O'Brien with his July 2019 release.
 Michael White spoke about being jailed by the Iranian regime.
 'It was a major, major trap. I was apprehended there,' he said. 'But what you did sir, is you were able to get me out of that prison in record time, it was amazing,' White said.
 And then Josh Holt, along with his wife Thamara, who had both been jailed in Venezuela, talked about how it was a 'great honor' for Trump to immediately welcome them to the White House in June 2018, when they got back.
 'I don't really remember a whole lot of it,' Holt admitted. 'It's nice to meet you again.'
 Pastor Bryan Nerren, who was detained as he was traveling through India to get to Nepal.
 'The darkest moment of our whole time together, your letter to my wife came, and it really gave her the hope and the peace,' Nerren said.
 Overall, Trump boasted that he had freed 50 American hostages from 22 countries.
 Earlier in the first night of the RNC, Trump thanked a group of frontline workers from the White House.
 'There are my friends, these are the incredible workers that helped us so much with the COVID - we can call it many different things, from China virus - I don't want to go through all the names because some people may get insulted but that's the way it is,' Trump said jumpstarting the conversation.
 'These are great, great people. Great job, thank you!' he continued.
 The president then went around and found out he was spoking to two postal workers, including a Post Office custodian.
 'That profession will never be out of business,' Trump commented.
 He had also invited to the White House a trucker from Ohio.
 'Well, congratulations, I love the truckers,' Trump said. 'They're on my side.'
 Two nurses were in the room, along with a police officer from Colorado who had contracted - and recovered from - COVID-19.
 'We jsut have to make this Chian virus go away, and it's happening,' the president said.
 The two Trump-helmed segments were part of more than two hours of programming that marked the first night of the Republican Pary's own 'virtual' convention.
 Most of the mainstage speeches were being filmed several blocks down the road at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C.
 While others, like that of Rep. Jim Jordan, were filmed from home.
 Earlier Monday, Trump had traveled to North Carolina, which had been the original site of the 2020 RNC, before the president called it off and tried to move the major speaking portions to Florida.
 The Jacksonville, Florida portion had to be cancelled as well due to a spike in the state's coronavirus cases.
 The president is due to speak Thursday from the White House to officially accept his party's nomination.

STOP TREMBLING, YOU LOOK LIKE A CRACKHEAD’ | Picking up where “Would You Like to Know the Sex?” left off, Arabella spotted her attacker, David, across the bar looking like he hadn’t a care in the world. In the blink of an eye, she pulled Terry into the loo and revealed her plan to drug him and give him a taste of his own medicine. “F--k, it’s a lot,” said Terry. “It’s been a lot, though, hasn’t it?” Bella replied. That, it had been. So they disguised themselves and returned to the club, using Terry as a decoy with David’s friend, Michael, so that Arabella could introduce herself to her attacker — sorry, “Patrick,” is it? — while Theodora swiped from the predator’s pocket the leftovers of the sedative with which he'd dosed his would-be victim's drink. Playing drugged (since, obviously, she didn't drink the cocktail), Arabella allowed David to lead her to the bathroom and remove her panties before revealing that not only was she conscious, but she knew that a criminal always returned to the scene of the crime. In other words, busted, bastard. Under the stall, Theo managed to stab David with a syringe full of his own date-rape drug, after which the women allowed him to leave. But, um, what if Theo had given him too much of the drug? “He could die for all I care,” said Terry. Except for the fact that he had Bella’s undies — evidence. So the trio followed David. And followed him. And followed him. Finally, the drug took its toll, and he collapsed in the street. At that point, Arabella retrieved her skivvies. But she wasn’t ready to leave him just yet.

On Tuesday morning, Australian terrorist Brenton Tarrant showed clear signs of emotion as he awaits sentencing for the Christchurch mosque shootings he carried out last year.
 A procession of his victims have presented heartbreaking testimony to the High Court this week, describing the loss of their loved ones and their still-raw traumas.
 Several have said they have still trouble getting to sleep, more than a year after the attack.
 Many have described ongoing financial difficulties, trouble socialising, and of course, the grief of losing husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters and friends.
 Very few have elicited emotion from Tarrant, sitting roughly five metres away in the dock.
 That was until Zahid Ismail took his place in court, standing stoically and eyeballing Tarrant while his pre-recorded video played on large screens erected in the court.
 Mr Ismail lost his twin brother Junaid, who died of a gunshot wound to the chest at Al Noor mosque.
 "While my pregnant wife and I were parking, a shooting was coming into reality," he said.
 "My brother is now not able to see his children grow and see their development into adulthood."
 Ms Ismail then described Junaid's "passion for cricket and pride in his long beard".
 Tarrant turned his gaze from the screen and looked towards Mr Ismail, chuckling in acknowledgement.
 Mr Ismail, his nose flared and his cheeks pulsing in and out, increased the intensity of his stare.
 "I wanted to see if there was any empathy," he told AAP outside court.
 "There is definitely a human being in there."
 For much of the sentencing, Tarrant has sat largely still.
 Sometimes the 29-year-old will rest his hand on his desk, tapping one finger repeatedly while the rest of his cross-legged body remains motionless.
 The terrorist is not inattentive.
 He has maintained his gaze on speakers during their statements, or the large screens when pre-recorded statements play.
 He has occasionally nodded to victims as they have concluded their statements.
 Mr Ismail was followed by his sister, Raesha Ismail, who described her non- Muslim community's embrace of her Islamic faith in the wake of the attack.
 "After the events of March 15 I don't think I have to hide my faith in the workplace. This has been positive," she said.
 "I've put up a Muslim calendar at work ... I was asked to host an Eid party which was well attended.
 "i have strengthened my voice to be able to speak up for when it matters."
 Both Mr and Mrs Ismail displayed the defiance that has characterised so many of the victims through the court this week.
 "Since the passing of my brother ... I've had visions of what his future would have been like, with his wife and children," Ms Ismail said.
 "Our family will bring them up to be proud New Zealand children ... it is a source of healing to be able to help out when I can."
 Mr Ismail told AAP his testimony was "a healing moment".
 "My brother is now not able to see his children grow and see their development into adulthood. But they will become confident proud Kiwis that live in the same place as their Daddy lived," he said.
 "My family and I have always been strong individuals. I continue to attend (Al Noor mosque) and pray with passion and strength."

As expected, Persoon started the first of the 10 two-minute rounds aggressively, bombarding former Olympic champion Taylor. Taylor opted for the counterattack and avoided as many of Persoon’s blows as possible. As the fight went on, Taylor managed to land more accurate blows than her opponent.
 The three judges awarded Taylor the win 98-93, 96-94 and 96-94, compared to the 95-95, 96-94 and 96-94 judgement handed out in New York last summer that led to calls for a rematch.
 Persoon, who is also an officer with the federal police, has suggested she might now consider switching to the featherweight category. “I had to eat a lot to gain weight, and because of that I was lacking power,” she said. “You need power to get Taylor down, otherwise it will be technical and she cannot be beaten on that.”
 The match was part of the Matchroom Fight Camp series, taking place in the grounds of boxing promoter Eddie Hearns’ Essex mansion throughout the summer. No fans were present because of Covid-19 regulations.
 “I knew I would have to dig deep,” said Taylor, 34, who is undefeated in her last 16 matches, winning six of them via knockout. “The fight went as planned, and I thought I boxed a lot smarter this time. It was a better performance. We’ve had two fights, put in 20 gruelling rounds. It’s great to have that rivalry in women’s boxing.”
