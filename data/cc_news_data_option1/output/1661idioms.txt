The meeting also saw the council’s capital strategy for 2020/21 adopted, but Cllr Christopher Edmonds, Lead Member for Resources & Performance, admitted that it would have to be reviewed in light of the financial difficulties the council faces as a result of COVID-19.
 Lisa Buckle, the council’s head of finance, added that frequent budget monitoring reports would be presented to members and done on a monthly basis, rather than quarterly as traditionally has been the case.
 Cllr Neil Jory, leader of the council, added that they have been trying to impress of Central Government the contribution that Local Government is making and how financially they are being affected by the crisis and the restrictions.

 “My first day back in the hospital was April 24,” Duvernay-Tardif, who holds a doctorate degree in medicine, told Sports Illustrated. “I felt nervous the night before, but a good nervous, like before a game, and I packed everything neatly: scrubs, white coat, extra pens, even a second pair of shoes that I could leave in my locker, knowing they were clean. I wasn’t aware the Chiefs had drafted a running back that night in the first round, even though I will block for my future teammate, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, from LSU.”
 Duvernay-Tardif said there has been one positive COVID-19 case at the long- term care facility near Montreal where he has been working.
 In 2018, Duvernay-Tardif made headlines when he asked the NFL if he could include M.D. on the back of his jersey after he got his medical doctorate from McGill University. The NFL denied his request.

"Meghan said they made it seem like this is the way it is, deal with it. Harry had been dealing with it far too long," the source added. "She said he wasn't going to let this destroy her life and their marriage."
 The source also claims that "Meghan said Harry made it crystal clear that they could not function in good faith under the current system... and that if it wasn't revised and updated to their liking, they would have no other choice than to break from the royal family. She said no one took his pleas seriously, so they had to take the issue into their own hands. This was about protecting the family and doing right by Princess Diana. She said the British tabloids have haunted Harry since childhood and should have been kicked out of the media pool long ago. The system is broken and Harry wanted to fix it. She said he needed to take a stand and now they are doing it together."
 Source quotes should always be taken with a grain of salt, but there's no denying that Meghan's treatment by U.K. media was incredibly harsh--and the fact that she left England because of it? More than understandable.

"Let's put it this way. We are living in a world where everybody wants to know everything. I completely understand why everyone asks about it. Everybody I meet asks me about it, in some roundabout way. I just feel like, I'm doing work because of that character. Before Kalinda, I was always coming in for a few lines and it was hard to get roles. If people always want to know what happened, OK, it's a small price to pay for all the wonderful things that show has given me. It sounds diplomatic, but it's how I feel," Panjabi said when asked if she was surprised people are still interested in knowing what happened.
 In Panjabi's final episode, she appeared to film a scene with Margulies-- appeared being the key word. They shot it separately and it was put together with CGI. Panjabi said feels "the Alicia and Kalinda scenes were one of the highlights of the show," and she is "very proud of them." But that's all she's saying about what happened behind the scenes. "I've said what I'm going to say," she told _The New York Times_.

"Everybody in the family lived until at least 95, except one uncle," Merola said. "My mother is a survivor. She is not human. She has superhuman DNA."
 Friedman, a resident of the North Westchester Restorative Therapy and Nursing Center in Lake Mohegan, New York, was taken to the hospital March 21 for a minor medical procedure but received a COVID-19 diagnosis. She spent a week in the hospital then returned to the nursing home, where she was isolated in her room.
 After running a fever on and off for several weeks, Friedman finally tested negative for coronavirus April 20.
 Merola hasn’t been able to visit her mother since February, due to back trouble, and because Friedman is nearly deaf, they can’t speak on the phone. But the nurses have kept Merola updated with her mother’s progress.
 “They tell me she’s doing great. She’s up and about as much as possible. She’s looking for wool to crochet with,” Merola said. "If my mother could see this, I’d tell her, ‘You keep going, Ma. You’re gonna outlive us all.’”

COVID-19’s untimely appearance has thrown a wrench into everyone’s career plans. After all, many are being forced to work from home, and that’s if they’re lucky enough to still have a job at all. You’d be forgiven, then, for feeling uneasy about the future. But, good news, there are things you can do to mitigate the risk to your situation. And, with most of us shuttered inside, there’s never been a better time to explore options.
 According to the Project Management Institute, demand for professional project managers is expected to grow by 33 percent in the coming years. That translates to millions of new jobs, and a lot of those are poised to earn top salaries. So, if your current career track seems less clear now than it did a few weeks ago, then project management is a field that’s worth exploring. The Complete Project and Quality Management Certification Bundle can get you up to speed with the essentials right from home.
 The Complete Project and Quality Management Certification Bundle includes eight courses, valued at $1,170, that’ll get you prepared for an enduring career. You’ll get acquainted with popular project management methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and Six Sigma. And you’ll walk away with the skills required to earn industry-recognized certifications such as your Six Sigma Green and Black Belts, so you’ll have an easier time finding a job when the time comes.
 Best of all, you can take the courses in this bundle from the comfort of your own home. There is no in-person component to this training. All you need is a desktop computer or mobile device, an internet connection, and the willingness to work hard. And, since you’ll enjoy lifetime access, there are no course deadlines to meet. You just go at your own pace and complete them at your leisure.
 At some point, life will return to normal. And, when it does, you won't want to be left out in the cold. Even if you don’t wind up changing careers, The Complete Project and Quality Management Certification Bundle — discounted to just $29.99 — is a near risk-free resource that could make a sizable impact later on, no matter what kind of field you're in.

WESTCHESTER COUNTY, New York (WPIX/CNN) - A New York woman born during the Spanish flu pandemic has the distinction of surviving a second pandemic, more than 100 years after she survived the first one.
 Angelina Friedman, née Sciales, came into the world in 1918 on a passenger ship bringing immigrants from Italy to New York City. It was during the second wave of the Spanish flu pandemic, which is sometimes compared to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “Her mother died giving birth on the ship, and she was taken care of by her two sisters, who were also on board,” said Joanne Merola, Friedman’s daughter.
