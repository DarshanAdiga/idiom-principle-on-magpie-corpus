Did you know batters once requested whether they got a low or high pitch? Or that pitchers had to throw underhand until 1883? Or that, until 1930, ground- rule doubles were counted as home runs? I'm sure there were folks in the early 1900s complaining that baseball wasn't the way it was intended to be, but baseball is constantly evolving.)


  Or worse — the reflexive diatribe amongst anti-DH folks about "strategy" with no DH. It's not "strategy" to work around the pitcher in your lineup, and what "strategy" there is involved isn't exactly a big surprise anyway, whether it's bunting a runner up a bag or another measure designed to get around the gaping hole in the No. 9 spot in the lineup. Most of the "strategy" in non-DH games is more like an obligation.


  At my core, I want baseball. Let the Chicago White Sox wear red socks and the Boston Red Sox wear white ones. Give me thousand-hour-long Yankees-Red Sox games that slobbered over by the national TV outlets. I don't care. I'm not going to be fussy if baseball is back in my life again.


  • Red Streaks solved? — One of my Daily Top 5's featured my favorite Vigo County high school nicknames of lore. I mentioned in the column that I didn't know the origin of Terre Haute Wiley's Red Streaks, surmising that it had to do with the fact that Wiley's color was red and that when the ran, they streaked by you.


  I wasn't too far off, according to reader Bernie Carney, who sent me a letter explaining the origin as he understands it.


  Carney explained that Wiley's track team in the early 1920s was elite level. Indeed, Wiley won state championships in the old 880-yard (re: half-mile) relay in 1923 and 1924. According to Carney, three of the runners were Herb Laffoon, Sylvester Laffoon and Dick Grey.


  They also played football for Wiley, and playing off of their fame as track state champions, Carney explained how the nickname came about.


  "The two Laffoons and Grey played football. Of course, they were running backs in their red and white uniforms. One day in the Terre Haute Tribune, sports editor Robert White called them the 'Red Streaks' because they were so fast. Sports reporters played around with 'Red Streaks' for years. In the late 20s, 'Red Streaks' was officially adopted as the school's nickname," Carney said.


  Very cool information, Robert, thanks for reaching out! If you ever want to drop me a line about area sports history, send us a letter or hit me up at sports@tribstar.com. I love learning about this stuff.


  • Florida Tech eliminates football — A Division II Florida school making a decision to eliminate a sport is not usually newsworthy here in Terre Haute, but Florida Tech's elimination of its program on Monday — a decision made due to the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis — has local ties.


  The program was helmed by Terre Haute native Steve Englehart at its outset in 2013. The former Terre Haute North and Indiana State football player (and assistant coach) and former head coach at Rose-Hulman was the only boss Florida Tech ever had. He led the Panthers to two Division II playoff berths and had a record off 44-35 at the school, pretty good when you consider the school was starting from scratch.


  Englehart also employed several former ISU players and Rose-Hulman personnel as assistant coaches. Former ISU linebacker Aaron Archie and former RHIT assistant and interim coach Jayson Martin were on Englehart's current staff. Several others with area connections were also on-staff there in the recent past too.


  I know Englehart and Archie well after covering both during their time as Sycamores and Engineers. You hate it when bad things happen to good people. I hope everyone lands on their feet, and sadly, this is likely not the first story we'll read like this. Athletic departments are going to have hard, and once unthinkable, decisions to make as the financial impact of this crisis hit home.

The government has outlined its plan to phase children's return to nurseries and primary schools from next month.


  And while the move towards some sort of normality has been welcomed by some, it has also sparked huge concern among parents, grandparents and those working in education and childcare settings.


  Providing the rate of coronavirus transmission remains low, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed on Sunday that schools will reopen on June 1, with Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes the first to go back.


  Nurseries and childminders can also reopen from that date and older pupils in Year 10 and 12, who have key exams next year, have been told to prepare for 'some face to face contact' with their secondary school and college teachers.


  Its wider plan is to get all primary school children back in for a month before the summer holidays, but again it's dependent on the transmission rate and how well it goes with the first intake.

Sure. Clearly, we are sharing with you our view on EBITDA, but we are not in this instance sharing an actual guidance range. But if I can give a little bit more color around what we see on the back of the prevailing view of the economic assessment, I think you move from what I would call the top end. Stable implies a degree of recovery on the travel patterns and therefore the roaming trends in the second half of the year. So better than the minus 70% we see now. And at the lower end, if you want, on the slightly down side of the equation, what you would have is no significant roaming recovery and the combination of pressure from a broader negative economic outturn if this is what we will see. So that's a little bit how we have been thinking about the 2 extremes. From a cost perspective, we have factored in obviously our transformation numbers as well as a degree of stability in our capital intensity, which is what Nick was explaining earlier, and no major volume changes.

DEAR DR. ROACH: My 18-year-old daughter has had digestive problems on and off for a few years now. Her appendix was removed in March 2015. She had brutal abdominal pain, but the ultrasound scan didn't show anything wrong with her appendix. Summer 2018, she started having bad digestion problems. She could hardly hold anything in. The food came back out, either by diarrhea or vomiting.


  Our family doctor sent her to a pediatric gastroenterologist. She had a complete workup, including stool cultures, the entire thing. They found nothing wrong with her. Now she has noticed that eating anything warm makes her feel "wobbly." She often eats a popsicle when that happens, and the "wobbliness" magically disappears.


  Do you think it could be a problem with her vagus nerve? Our family doctor is not taking this possibility seriously at all and will not investigate it. She now has diarrhea only once or twice a month, which starts with pain or discomfort. She occasionally still has vomiting. The abdominal discomfort gets somewhat better after a bowel movement, but it's really the popsicle that makes it get better. -- J.M.

In Saudi Arabia, the death in prison last month of leading rights defender Abdullah al-Hamid, reportedly for lack of medical care, triggered international condemnation.
 Last year, public pressure forced the reversal of a death sentence imposed on peaceful activist Israa al-Ghomgham. And Western media repeatedly reference jailed Saudi women activists like Loujain Halhoul, tarnishing the image of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
 Such is the work of Sayed Alwadaei.
 After taking part in pro-democracy protests in Bahrain during the Arab Spring, Mr. Alwadaei was assaulted by government agents, tortured, and imprisoned for six months; he still bears scars on his forehead. In 2012, he fled to the U.K.
 From London, Mr. Alwadaei founded the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), a network of citizens and activists in his home country and abroad working to pressure Bahrain’s rulers to release activists, improve prisoner conditions, and challenge Western governments’ unwavering support for Manama.
 BIRD carries the voice of prisoners and survivors to the international media and to the United Nations, sharing recordings of prisoner phone calls and firsthand testimonies of torture, abuse, and prison conditions. It has swayed public opinion at home and in the U.K., a key Bahrain supporter.
 Mr. Alwadaei has changed the conversation, linking the monarchy to rights abuses, and inspiring people to question Western backing for the king. During a 2018 U.K. parliamentary debate calling attention to “continuing human rights abuses in Bahrain,” MPs criticized London’s “failed” policies and singled out Mr. Alwadaei for his “bravery and tenacity.”
 “The moment they see their names mentioned in a report on torture or their image portrayed as torturers, they will think twice before they commit an abuse again,” Mr. Alwadaei says from London.

LONDON -- Sterling extended Monday's losses on Tuesday, hitting a 20-day low versus the euro, as continued confusion over government plans to ease lockdown measures, the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe and revived Brexit risks all weighed on the pound.


  Britain extended its job retention scheme, in which the government pays 80% of furloughed workers' wages, by another four months until the end of October.


  The announcement did little to move the pound, which is the worst-performing G10 currency so far this month, held down by concerns about the government's handling of the crisis.


  Official data published on Tuesday showed Britain's death toll from COVID-19 topped 38,000 as of early May, having overtaken Italy as the worst affected country in Europe. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans for easing the lockdown have meanwhile been widely criticized as unclear.


  Rabobank's head of FX strategy Jane Foley said international investors were likely to have been deterred by that lack of clarity and the government's slowness to carry out COVID-19 testing and provide protective equipment for healthcare staff.


  "Insofar as we do have a current account deficit in the UK I think we always have to consider how the UK appears from the point of view of an overseas investor," she said.


  "From a political point of view in the UK, there really hasn't been anything particularly positive."


  The United Kingdom is racking up new debt at a furious pace: it is due to issue 180 billion pounds of government debt between May and July, more than previously planned for the entire financial year.


  The country's debt mountain exceeds $2.5 trillion and its public sector net borrowing could reach 14% of gross domestic product this year, the biggest single-year deficit since World War Two.


  The pound extended Monday's losses against both the dollar and the euro. Versus the dollar, it was last at $1.2314, down 0.2% from New York's close.


  Against a stronger euro, the pound fell to its lowest since April 22 and was last down around 0.7% at 88.228 pence .


  "STAY ALERT"


  Johnson outlined the government's changed advice about the lockdown in a televised speech on Sunday. A 51-page document published on Monday detailed the plans, followed by a series of sector-by-sector documents for employers and workers.


  But the new measures were widely criticized for leaving it unclear whether Britons should return to work.


  Adding to the confusion, leaders of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland made clear they did not share Johnson's approach and rejected his new core message of "stay alert," instead sticking to the previous "stay at home" slogan.


  The market has turned increasingly short on the pound over the last 10 weeks, as the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic -- likely to be the worst recession in 300 years -- is compounded by the risk Britain will end a post- Brexit transition period on Dec. 31 without a deal with the European Union.


  Commerzbank FX strategist Thu Lan Nguyen said the government's struggle to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic did not bode well for its handling of trade talks with the EU, and advised clients to be cautious on sterling.


  Britain and the EU started their penultimate scheduled round of trade talks via teleconference on Monday, having made little progress on any major sticking points.


  Rabobank's Foley said the fact investors were becoming more alert to the looming risk that Britain will fail to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU could be another reason for the pound trading at levels largely unseen since late 2016.


  "There's got to be a very significant risk that, on top of the worst recession for three centuries, you're going to have confusion potentially at the border (in January)," she said.


  "The UK government desperately needs some positive headlines."

Details are still sparse about this new remaster. (Oneal said Robomodo had nothing to do with it.) But Oneal was willing to speak at length about gameplay specifics. In terms of the revert, the essential combo mechanic missing from _THPS HD_ that allowed players to string vert tricks to street maneuvers, she said, "My finger just automatically hits that trigger button. It's just second nature, so of course we had to include [the revert]. So that's basically our approach to how we've been remastering this game."
 Tony Hawk, the former _Esquire_ intern (wink wink) who tweeted in 2018, "I am no longer working with [Activision]," was apparently "very much involved" with this production. "He's not just a great skater," Oneal said. "He's also good at playing this game... I've got to tell you, one of the most gratifying things I've ever heard was him saying, 'You guys got this.'"

Nellie passed away peacefully with her daughter Catherine at her side at The Wynfield LTC, in Oshawa, on Saturday, April 25, 2020. She was one month shy of her 97th year. Her son and daughter were both able to be with her and comfort her. In her final days she was also surrounded by all the special caregivers on the Purple Woods Unit who cared daily for her and lovingly remember her smile and her character. Daughter of the late Wasyl and Mary Tkatch of Canora, SK and Oshawa, ON. Beloved wife of the late Jacob Dennis and loving mother of Ron Dennis of MacArthur Mills, ON and Catherine Meunier (Dennis) and her husband John of Orillia, ON. Loving sister of the late John Tkatch (Jane) and Aunt to her nieces Jan Foell (Werner) and Pat Suddard (Neil). Special "Aunt Nell" to Jim and Kathy Shermeto of Oshawa. Nellie had a life well lived. Family and friends were important to her and in all she did, whether it was the weekly Sunday family dinners, summer camping at Balsam Lake, working at Sears at the Oshawa Centre, home baking, making Ukrainian Easter Eggs or travelling, Nellie was inquisitive and liked to see new places and try new crafts, and made friends wherever she went. She was a long-standing member of St. Stephen's United Church, Oshawa. Nellie encouraged her children to be the best they could be and instilled her values in them. In her retirement years, Nellie spent winters in Poinsettia Park, Fort Myers, FL with her husband Jacob. These were special times for her and Jacob. She was so involved with all the activities in the park. She loved Florida and the sunshine. She painted, rode her three wheel bike, played shuffleboard, danced, sang, played bingo, went on day trips and had her own orange trees! She was truly the Snowbird. One of her paintings was donated in her memory to The Wynfield - Purple Woods. Nellie's last home for the past eight years was on Purple Woods in The Wynfield LTC in Oshawa. The care she received there from all the caregivers, rec. staff, nurses, hairdresser, social workers, therapists, was beyond exceptional. They were family to her. She played bingo, went on day trips, shopping trips, lunch, and outings with her family, celebrated special family dinners for holidays and, above all else... loved watching her Blue Jays on TV. Cremation arrangements were entrusted to McINTOSH-ANDERSON-KELLAM FUNERAL HOME LTD., 152 King St. E., Oshawa (905) 433-5558. There will be a private family interment due to the Covid pandemic. We encourage relatives and friends to express their sympathies and condolences online at makfuneralhome.com.

Yes, Emmet. That's an excellent question. Actually, you're sort of reflecting, in a way, the whole conversation we were having at the Board. Because at the Board we were talking about our strategy process and in what way would we do it differently this year. And one of the things that we were talking about was -- I think it's the moment where you step back and say, "I think there will be behavioral changes, structural changes to society across the board over the next 10 years as a result of this." And therefore, what are the opportunities for us as a business to, if you like, get stronger through a recession? Clearly there's going to be recession, maybe very deep, maybe very prolonged. We don't know. There are many different views. If I park the recessionary impact to one side and sort of look at it from a structural perspective, I'd say probably 3 points. First is you've got a situation where there has definitely been an appreciation for quality. People are understanding the quality of networks now.

Antonelli mulled over the different ways she could host a second free-throw marathon this spring. The current health crisis limited her options.


  Her inspiration came from Frankie. She’s watched him find different ways to cope with the lack of social interaction during this quarantine. Frankie loves people. She knows there’s bound to be countless others like him longing for stimulation once the social restrictions have been lifted. That’s going to cost money to facilitate.


  “Special education is always the least funded and the first cut,” Antonelli explained. “It’s not going to all of a sudden resume when we start to get back to normal. It’s going to take the proper resources to get things moving again, to get everyone moving again.”


  Frankie will tell you he’s the best shooter in the Antonelli family. He’s honed his form on the family’s home court: the driveway out front of their Mount Pleasant home. Wars have been raged over games of HORSE out there on the pavement.


  The family driveway has been a proving ground for Antonelli before. Eight years ago, she challenged six women’s college basketball teams, one each week, to make 100 15-foot jump shots. She did it first and then sent out the videos to the teams. Sometimes it was windy. Sometimes it would rain. She did it every day anyway.


  So now she’ll do it every hour. Even if it rains. Even when it gets dark. The 24 Hours of Nothing But Net is continuing on. Antonelli will start with 100 free throws at noon on May 16 and then make 100 more at the top of every hour after.


  “As long as I’ve been playing basketball, we’ve always gone to the driveway,” Antonelli said. There’s something pure about it, she explained. “It resonates all the way back to my childhood. It’s where I fell in love with this game.”


  The marathon will be live streamed on YouTube and Facebook. There will be prizes given away. Dr. Dish has donated a shooting machine valued at $3,000. There will be entertainment in between her free throws. Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney has already recorded an interview to be broadcast on the live stream and several other well-known sports figures are on board as well.


  Antonelli shot 94% during last year’s event. Impressive enough that even she was surprised, especially considering she shot around 72% from the free-throw line through her four-year college career at N.C. State.


  Well-known personalities from all over the sports world —even CBS Sports’ leading broadcaster Jim Nantz — made large contributions last year. Countless other people whose names you would never recognize, who just wanted to be a part of a good cause, pledged their money as well.


  The event raised $50,000 before it even began last year, and $10,000 more even after it ended. Antonelli’s expectation to match that amount is realistically cautious. That doesn’t mean the success of the event, its impact, can’t be matched or even exceeded.


  “There’s no question that my competitive sprit is my greatest strength and my very weakness,” Anteonlli said. “It’s not about whether I can finish anymore. It’s about whether we can raise this event to a higher level.”


  Sam Mungo will never play college basketball. He may not play much more of any kind of basketball. But for a day, he was part of a team. He ran. He competed. He sweated. He was triumphant with his teammates. Win or lose, they celebrated together. He even has the purple No. 4 jersey hanging up to prove it.


  “That’s why we’re doing this. Stories like that are why this is important,” Antonelli said. “It’s not really the free throws. It’s what they represent.”


  Antonelli sees a future for this event that one day might be nationwide, including other public figures in other states — a sort of national torch run from free-throws lines across the country.


  For now, though, for this summer at least, the family driveway will have to do. Stories like Mungo’s and countless others who’ve been impacted by last year’s event make it clear why, even if the rest of the sports world has stopped this spring, 24 Hours of Nothing But Net must continue.

Dax has to wear a cast and can really only do one-handed tasks now thanks to his injury, but he did manage to handle one gross chore recently.


  "He did clean out the drain in our shower the other day," Kristen admits. "He pulled out the biggest wad of fur that I have ever... it was like the size of a small purebred dog... That was a week ago and even now our girls won't shower in that shower because they're scared that the hair monster's going to come up and suck them down the drain."


  Kristen and Dax are parents to daughters Lincoln, 7, and Delta, 5, and Kristen jokes that she "gave up" on homeschooling her youngest.  

  "I attempted to give her some math problems in the beginning of this quarantine and I handed them to her and she answered the first and second one and then she got real sassy and in the answer grid for the rest of the questions, she just wrote, 'No, no, no,'" Kristen quips.

A number of improvement projects are taking place this year along the Raccoon River Valley Trail.


   


  Starting May 12, 2020, a bridge lighting project in Adel will begin. Crews will close this bridge during the day, but hope to reopen it for trail users in the evenings and on weekends. Impacts from this Adel bridge lighting project are expected from mid-May through mid-June.


   


  Maintenance work continues along the Raccoon River Valley Tail as contractors are conducting overlay work and bridge repair projects between Adel and Redfield. For the safety of trail users and workers, segments of the Raccoon River Valley Trail will be closed between Adel and Redfield through mid- summer. No detour routes are available.


   


  "While we recognize this is a short-term inconvenience, the trail improvements will help us maintain this world-class trail," said Mike Wallace, Dallas County Conservation Board Director.


   


  "The safety of trail users is our highest priority," Wallace continued. "Even with the necessary trail closures, Dallas County offers up dozens of miles of paved path along the north loop of the Raccoon River Valley Trail and High Trestle Trail."

While the top three positions in WoodMac's ranking were held by Western companies, the immensity of China's wind market allowed three Chinese suppliers to claim the next three spots: Goldwind, Envision and Mingyang.


  Unlike the solar industry, China's wind turbine manufacturers have largely failed to break out of their home market, with just 600 megawatts of Chinese turbines exported last year. Goldwind, China's most important wind company on the global stage, is currently delivering turbines through the Port of Vancouver to a 200-megawatt project in the Canadian prairies, a potentially significant breakthrough for the company in the North American market.


  ## Big get bigger in global wind market


  Amid a growing global wind market -- expected by WoodMac to average around 77 gigawatts of new annual installations during the 2020s -- the number of major turbine makers is on the decline.


  "Smaller regional players, including Senvion, Suzlon, Inox, XEMC and WEG, lost market share due to challenging market conditions," said Shashi Barla, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie. "This resulted in financial difficulties that will jeopardize their future participation in the wind sector."


  Rounding out the top 10 list of leading wind turbine suppliers in 2019 were Nordex (Germany), Windey (China), Enercon (Germany) and Sewind (China).


  Despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to temporary factory closures, logistical bottlenecks and financial losses at the industry's major manufacturers (including Vestas and SGRE), WoodMac expects only a modest hit to the global market this year -- having previously shaved 4.9 gigawatts off its previous forecast for the 2020 market.


  That leaves the global market on track for 73 gigawatts of total installations in 2019, a significant step up from last year as China and the U.S. remain on track to add record volumes this year.

We have seen a strong response in Germany to our higher-speed offers of up to 1 gig per second. This has enabled clear differentiation of our offer on both speed and reliability, something we are focused on across our markets. We have also streamlined and simplified the range of plans available to customers, starting with second brands in the value segment through to speed-tiered unlimited plans. We now have more than 4 million unlimited mobile customers across 6 markets, with increasing demand in a world where everyone is relying on fixed and mobile communication. This year, mobile data per user was up to 5.7 gig, which is 55% up year-over-year.

The county total now includes 76 cases in Michigan City and 55 in La Porte after those figures were updated over the weekend. It also shows 14 cases in Westville, 3 each in Trail Creek and Union Mills; 2 each in Rolling Prairie and Kingsford Heights; and 1 each in Wanatah, Hanna and Mill Creek.


  La Porte County Commissioner Sheila Matias issued a statement on Facebook saying she was “Feeling sad that we have 14 new CV-19 cases [Sunday], 9 deaths now in our county ... one more death at Westville Correctional.


  “It’s the equal opportunity virus in all of our communities ... and in our hospitals, nursing homes and prisons. Bless the people who work there who are our neighbors and family members. They go in to work and then come back out to live with all of us. They’re pretty darn heroic in my book.”


  Over half of the county cases were reported at the Westville Correctional Facility, a figure the county placed at 170 cases. Another 4 cases were reported at the Indiana State Prison.


  Figures released by the Indiana Department of Correction show 175 inmate cases and 84 staff cases at Westville; 3 offender and 11 staff cases at ISP; and 1 staff case at the La Porte Juvenile Facility.


  Matias remains troubled by the prison situation.


  “The prisons are really troubling because they’re testing so few. Someone shared that the inmates have a sentence to serve, but for most, it wasn’t mandated to be a death sentence,” she said.


  “At Indiana State Prison in MC, they have tested 6 inmates out of 2400 – 5 were positive. And at Westville Correctional, where there are 5 deaths [6 according to IDOC], they tested 238 staff with 79 positives and tested 201 inmates with 170 positives,” she said.

GRIFFIN, Ga. (WGCL/CNN) - Police in a Georgia city say a 12-year-old boy is dead after his 5-year-old brother shot him with an abandoned gun in the bushes.Authorities in Griffin say the two boys and their 7-year-old sister were playing outside Saturday evening when the deadly shooting happened. The gun used in the shooting may have been discarded Saturday afternoon during a police pursuit when three men got away from the scene, leaving behind drugs.“The children were out here peacefully playing in the backyard on the trampoline, neighbor Tom Whitehead told WGCL, describing the scene just before the shooting.The 5-year-old told police he thought the gun was a toy when he found it and shot his older brother in the chest. The gun was found near where the drugs were recovered.Police are now turning their attention toward finding out who is responsible for discarding the gun.“We will leave no stone unturned as we search for the individuals responsible for the abandonment of this weapon,” Griffin Police Chief Mike Yates said.

"Taking advantage of near record-low interest rates is the No. 1 benefit," Gounaris told Business Insider. "How that translates to a borrower depends on their individual financial situation."
 For example, Business Insider contributor Eric Rosenberg was able to drop his interest rate by a full 1%, saving more than $50,000 over the life of the loan. His original rate of 4.25% on a $250,000, 30-year loan meant his total payments would be $442,746. Lowering the rate to 3.25% dropped that total amount to $391,686.
 Gounaris added that borrowers will want to make sure they're keeping the loan for long enough to break even on closing costs, too.
 Jerry Koors, president of Merchants Mortgages, said rates are currently lower than previous lows seen in late 2012 and early 2013, so homeowners should jump at the chance to refinance.

These stones from outer space are referred to as meteors as they flash across the sky.


   


  The fragments that manage to make it to the earth before burning up in the atmosphere are called meteorites.


   


  Even in this day and age, the sight of a meteor streaking across the sky is awe inspiring.


   


  It was even more so for the American Indians, as they did not have science to explain these mysterious events. A bright flash of light, perhaps accompanied by a loud boom or thunder, could only be explained as a religious or spiritual occurrence.


   


  Furthermore, Native Americans often found unique "rocks" in the wake of one of these mystical events. Iron and nickel meteorites had utilitarian significance as they could be forged into excellent tools.


   


  They were the only form of iron available to the American Indians. For this reason, and due to their supernatural origins, American Indians deemed meteorites, and the tools made from them, sacred. As such, they worshipped these objects in religious ceremonies.


   


  American Indians often built their villages in the vicinity of meteor strikes where they mined these mineral-rich meteorites for decades or centuries after they struck earth.


   


  The origins of Boot Hill Museum's specimen pictured here are unknown. There is a good chance it came from a significant meteor strike which occurred about 20,000 years ago 50 miles east of Dodge City in Kiowa County near the town of Haviland.


   


  The meteor which fell fragmented into pieces large and small. Called the Brenham fall, the fragments which struck are a rare type of nickel-iron meteorites which scientists refer to as "pallasites." Trade by the American Indians took some of these meteorites as far east as the Hopewell mounds 1000 miles away in Ohio.


   


  The largest known meteorite from the Brenham fall is on display nearby at the Big Well in Greensburg, Kansas.


   


  It was found in 1882 and weighs 2.4 tons. Over the decades, more than two additional tons of meteorite fragments have been unearthed from this meteorite "farm" which is on private property.

These providers have been "very focused on the cost reduction of these core pieces of technology, but less on system integration and even less on load controls," Rao said.


  Span's ability to monitor and analyze how much power is consumed by various household loads, and to preconfigure and adjust which loads are powered during blackouts, could offer a significant advantage on that front, he said.  

  ## Under the hood of Span's home power control system


  The upfront cost of a Span panel is on par with or cheaper than the cost of upgrading a typical household panel and integrating the automated transfer switches and isolation transformers required with battery or EV charger installs, Rao said. The company also claims its product offers "significantly more functionality," he said.


  Mainstream electrical panel makers like Eaton and Schneider Electric have yet to tackle this kind of advanced functionality, most likely because they sell into highly cost-competitive global markets. There wasn't much need to alter otherwise reliable products before the era of household batteries and EV chargers.


  But customers with these devices want more control over how they interact with household energy use, Rao said. Even absent the threat of blackouts, customers want to manage loads to maximize the value of self-generated solar against time-of-use rates or to ensure their EVs are charging during off-peak hours, for example.


  Span's new funding round was led by new investor ArcTern Ventures (formerly MaRS Cleantech Fund) and joined by Capricorn Investment Group and Incite Ventures, the investment platform co-founded by Nest co-founder Matt Rogers. Some of its previous investors in a $3.5 million seed round in 2018, including Wireframe Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Energy Foundry, Ulu Ventures, Hardware Club, 1/0 Capital and Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, also joined the new round.


  Rogers, who is advising Span, said in an interview that Incite's investment was informed by his experience with the whole-home energy control technologies now on the market. "There are a lot of companies that give you charts and graphs" of home energy usage via circuit metering or energy disaggregation, he said. But in his view, "there needs to be some automation and control with the data that's done behind the scenes, without the user worrying about it."
