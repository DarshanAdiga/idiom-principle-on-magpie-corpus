VISTA, Calif. — On Sunday Nov. 8, Avery County native Blake Stanley became the newest member of an elite club of Avery natives to compete on the world stage when he looked to lift his way to gold in the United States Powerlifting Association Drug Tested North American Championships.
 Joining the likes of fellow Avery County legend and Olympic competitor Tommy Burleson, Stanley stepped onto the world-caliber stage, competing in both the 125 kg (275 pound) weight class full power and deadlift only competitions.
 The day started off rough for Blake, as he only went 1-for-3 in squats, posting 180 kg (396.8 pounds). Stanley regrouped, however, and was able to go 2-for-3 in bench press, posting 145 kg (319.6 pounds). In his deadlift competition, he went 2-for-3 and once again pulled 250 kg (551.1 pounds). Stanley then was able to lock out 275 kg (606.2 pounds), but did not receive credit for the lift due to hitching, or bouncing of the bar.
 Stanley totaled a cumulative 575 kg (1,267.6 pounds) for the day, which earned him a silver medal. He also claimed a bronze medal in the deadlift-only competition. Stanley’s performance qualified him to compete at next year’s USPA Drug Tested National Championship (currently scheduled for July in Palm Springs, Calif.) in the full power, bench press only and deadlift events. He also qualified to compete in next year’s International Powerlifting League (IPL) Drug Tested World Championship, with location and date to be determined.
 Stanley expressed deepest thanks to all of his friends, family and supporters. To learn more about Stanley’s accomplishments and career, as well as to follow his training and journey to the World Championships, follow him on Instagram @thecarolinaforklift.

It was also on these roadtrips that Lomax started interviewing musicians about their lives, communities, and personal travails; he would later ghostwrite for Lead Belly a brief autobiography based on such sessions, and his encouragement of Jelly Roll Morton resulted in a monthlong recitation of the jazz pioneer’s life story. Lomax embraced a romantic notion of selfhood--not just his own but that of the performers, too--and began to appreciate how “singers draw on their own experiences, use their bodies and their faces to register meaning and sincerity,” writes Szwed. Himself a college dropout, Lomax nonetheless felt closely associated with the intellectual trends of his era. Between the wars, Americans were in the midst of discovering their own national selfhood and beginning “to think seriously about the culture they had developed, and about where they stood among the nations of the world.” The new generation of anthropologists, including Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, who sought to meet this challenge by collapsing the distinction between high and low culture, helped propel Lomax’s emerging vision of a folk-based national identity. As Szwed writes: “The country was hungry for a vision of itself in song.”

Iowa officials have closed the books on an investment they once hoped would produce millions of gallons of ultra-green ethanol and millions of dollars in revenue for the state’s farmers.
 The Iowa Economic Development Authority approved a settlement with Poet DSM Advanced Biofuels on Oct. 16, ending a contract of incentives that helped enable construction of a massive plant to produce cellulosic ethanol — a fuel produced from crop waste like corncobs, husks and stalks instead of from corn, which could be put to other uses.
 Poet, the nation’s largest ethanol producer, announced last November that it would “pause” production at the plant in Emmetsburg. The company had partnered with Netherlands-based Royal DSM, an enzyme manufacturer, on the project, At the time, it said it planned to continue on-site research. But Poet idled the plant completely in July, leading to a total of 52 layoffs since the end of last year.

Szwed, a friend of Lomax, retains his personal sympathies as his biographer. He shies away from the harshest criticisms and seeks to rebut controversies, notably those surrounding ownership. The very idea of copyrighting folk songs remains contentious, but Szwed shows that Lomax’s aims were as a rule benevolent. His hand-to-mouth existence was all in the service of his “vision of turning folklore into national art”--which included a steady stream of books and commercial releases of his field recordings, together with later projects for radio and film, concerts, and festivals (he was an organizer of the renowned Newport Folk Festival).
