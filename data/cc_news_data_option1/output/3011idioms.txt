Before making your child begin their timeout, explain clearly why they have to do one. For instance, you could briefly say, "You hit your sister, you're going to a timeout." Then walk your child to the timeout chair. I recommend using a quiet, boring location, rather than a room with lots of toys, filled with people or where a TV or another distracting device is on. It helps to use a sturdy chair suitable for grownups, rather than one designed for children because kid-sized chairs can be easily pushed over or even thrown by upset children.

 The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on Friday said it employs state of the art technologies to safeguard the IT infrastructure, information generated by them, and the digital identities that access such information. "Maintaining privacy of details is of utmost priority at NPCI and we assure all our customers that data processed at our end is completely secured and not accessible by any unauthorised person," the payments service provider said in a detailed statement. The statement comes a day after news agency Reuters reported that a government audit found more than 40 security flaws in NPCI's systems, several of them falling under 'critical' and 'high risk' categories. For example, the government audit in March 2019 found, according to Reuters report, NPCI stored 16-digit card numbers and other personal information such as customer names, account numbers and national identity numbers in 'plain text' in some databases. Subsequently, those observations were resolved by NPCI, according to National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC), Rajesh Pant, whose office co-ordinated the audit, the story said. NPCI, in its statement, also quoted Rajesh Pant saying, "NPCI has provided higher levels of access to NCSC that are not normally made available to any stakeholders during regular course of business, as an effort to strengthen its cyber defense. I wish to compliment the top leadership of NPCI and their chief information security officer (CISO) for inculcating a culture of strong cyber security governance with a robust infrastructure which meets global security standards." NPCI processes about 2.5 billion transactions on a monthly basis using its indigenously developed platforms like RuPay, UPI, IMPS, AePS, NETC, Bharat Bill Pay etc. NPCI said in its statement that in order to thwart cyber-attacks, it has implemented technologies such as perimeter security controls, including various kinds of firewalls, micro- segmentation of network, routing controls, secured switch configurations, proxy servers and other latest technologies. The information gathered is protected through data leakage protection, digital rights management, tokenisation and encryption of sensitive data elements and active monitoring of both structured and unstructured data. The communication channels are encrypted, while the agency also employs various detective controls including deceptive technologies (decoys) as early indicators to identify cyber-attacks. "With the sophisticated security threats that our environment faces in the current times, NPCI's objective is to continuously fortify our security layers. In addition to steps that we take, we welcome and invite experts, including relevant authorities, for regular reviews and audits to keep our controls sharp and best in class," NPCI statement read. The statement said NPCI faces many inspections in line with regulatory and government compliances, while audits and inspections of various nature are conducted periodically to enhance and strengthen corporate governance. It reviews its codes and application security assessments, conducts regular internal audit across information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, and undergoes through external audits as well as regulatory inspections or audits from both, regulator and government nodal agencies, periodically. The agency said it also encourages surprise cybersecurity drills by third party experts, and all findings are elaborately reviewed and remediated to the satisfaction of the auditors. Highlights NCSC had found 40 security breach in NPCI in March 2019 NPCI says data security lapses found in audit remediated Data processed is secure and not accessible to anyone unauthorized NPCI says it employs state of the art technology to protect data NCSC gives clean chit to NPCI on data security

LeBron James scored the go-ahead basket as the Western Conference-leading Los Angeles Lakers returned to NBA action with a 103-101 victory against rivals the Los Angeles Clippers.
 James' layup with 12.8 seconds remaining ensured the Lakers topped the Clippers to move a step closer to clinching the number one seed in the west in Orlando, Florida on Thursday.
 The Lakers – led by Anthony Davis' 34 points and a 16-point, 11-rebound James double-double – are six-and-a-half games clear of the Clippers in the Western Conference.
 Paul George top scored for the Clippers with 30 points, while Kawhi Leonard added 28 of his own.
 The Lakers-Clippers showdown was the second game in a doubleheader as the NBA resumed with the Utah Jazz outlasting the New Orleans Pelicans at Walt Disney World Resort.


 COVID-19 forced the 2019-20 season to be postponed in March, but the league restarted behind closed doors, with all four teams kneeling in unison during the United States national anthem.
 Four-time MVP James and the Lakers dusted off some early rust to earn bragging rights against Leonard and the Clippers.
 The Lakers raced out of the blocks to lead 35-23 at the end of the opening quarter, but the Clippers moved ahead by 11 points midway through the third period.
 In the final quarter, George nailed a three-pointer with less than two minutes remaining to reduce the Lakers' lead to 99-98 before hitting another shot from beyond the arc to level the game at 101-apiece 29 seconds from the end.
 Three-time champion James, however, came up big with the late layup and a strong defensive effort on George, who missed a buzzer-beating three.

The European Commission has given its go-ahead to the acquisition of the rail business of Canadian engineering firm Bombardier by French train maker Alstom.
 Alstom, which makes the French TGV high-speed trains, said this year it had signed an agreement with a view to buy full control of Bombardier Transportation, for a price 5.8-6.2 billion euros ($6.3-6.7 billion) paid via a mix of cash and new Alstom shares.
 The Commission launched an investigation and initially found that the transaction raised serious competition issues. The bloc’s competition authorities cleared the acquisition on Friday after Asltom offered “significantly improved” commitments.
 “Alstom and Bombardier are leading providers of state-of-the-art trains used every day by millions of passengers across the European Union,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU commission vice-president in charge of competition. “Thanks to the comprehensive remedies offered to solve the competition concerns in the areas of very high-speed, mainline trains and mainline signalling, the Commission has been able to speedily review and approve this transaction.”

First and foremost, Thank you. Thank you to each and every individual who has prayed for me, thought of me, sent me their love and has showered me with their support. In this present moment, it is my only responsibility to be real with myself and to be real with the ones who truly love me and care for my healing. I have without fail, shared with you my brightest days, and I know that sharing with you what has been my darkest will be the light for any man or woman who is feeling the same defeat I felt just only a week ago. Every one of us has a desire, whether small or big, to make it out of where we come from to an ideal future place that includes, freedom to be who we choose, security for our children and families, and fortune to share with the ones we love. We believe these things can co-exist with just being happy. I believed that, that as a black woman, as an artist, an influence, a personality I could shape my world, and with whom I believed to be my partners, they could help me share my world. Over the past 11 years there were promises made to protect and portray my story, with the authenticity and honesty I gave. I was betrayed, taken advantage of, overworked, and underpaid. I wrote a letter over 2 months ago asking to be freed from what I believed was excessive and unfair. I explained in personal detail the demise I was experiencing. My cry for help went totally ignored. However the demands persisted. It was my spirit, and my soul that was tainted the most. There are a few things I count on most to be, a good mother, a good daughter, a good partner, a good sister, and a good person. Who I was, begun to mean little to nothing, because it would only be how I was portrayed on television that would matter. It was witnessing the slow death of the woman I became, that discouraged my will to fight. I felt like I was no longer living, I was existing for the purpose of a corporations gain and ratings, and that killed me. Mental illness is real. We have to normalize acknowledging it and stop associating it with shame and humiliation. The pain that I have experienced over the past 11 years has slowly ate away at my spirit and my mental.

 "Swimming in an uncontrolled environment such as a lake or river is much more dangerous than in a controlled environment, such as a pool, because of the currents, sudden temperature changes and drop points, and unpredictable weather."
 Nearly 50 per cent of people have gone into the water under the influence of alcohol or marijuana and of those, men are 30 per cent more likely to be under the influence than women when swimming, says the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus four per cent, 19 times out of 20.
 It says 20 per cent of those surveyed admitted to swimming out of bounds and men were 70 per cent more likely than women to venture into those areas.
 "This is especially dangerous at BC Hydro's recreation sites," the report says. "Many of these sites are located on working reservoirs, meaning there are dam structures that can be dangerous if signage is not obeyed and distance is not maintained."

 Tanto el presidente Donald Trump como su rival demócrata Joe Biden han prometido que, si ganan las elecciones de noviembre en Estados Unidos, emprenderán un avance radical durante los próximos cuatro años, aunque a través de caminos totalmente distintos.
 Trump, quien busca la reelección por el Partido Republicano, insiste en que los remedios económicos será la reducción de impuestos y regulaciones. Se muestra a sí mismo como un paladín conservador en un conflicto de valores aparentemente interminable, pero el presidente ofrece pocos detalles sobre cómo accionaría las palancas del gobierno en un segundo periodo de cuatro años.
 Por su parte, Biden, actúa como el abanderado de todo demócrata al catalogar al gobierno federal como la fuerza colectiva que podrá combatir al coronavirus, reconstruir la economía y enfrentar un ancestral racismo institucional y un sistema de inequidades sistemáticas. Un veterano de la política nacional, a Biden le encanta considerar su pasado negociador como prueba de que lo podrá hacer de nuevo desde la Oficina Oval.

Parma Hts. Police Chief Steve Scarschmidt said, “When a person receives a citation whether it is for traffic or non-traffic misdemeanor offense and the citation is ignored or unpaid, most often it is because the person did not have the money to pay the court fines/costs. Once they miss court and a warrant is issued or their license blocked, it can cause a snowball effect to play catch-up trying to do the right thing. Sometimes the person cited may live out of state and not want to come home to visit family because of the possibility they could be arrested. Other people live worried about the possibility of lights and sirens behind them because they know they have a warrant. This program offers them a way to begin a fresh start by eliminating their outstanding obligation with the Parma Heights Mayor’s Court. In essence, we are giving an incentive during tough times for compliance. But once the August Absolution event is over, officers will seek out the outstanding offenders again, so we are hoping all 495 names on that list are crossed off as complete.”

On the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, when Iraqis visit loved ones' tombs and take children to the funfair, the coronavirus pandemic put both cemeteries and Ferris wheels off-limits on Friday.
 The virus has cost almost 4,700 lives and infected over 121,000 people in Iraq, but it has also sharpened an economic crisis born of a slide in lifeline oil revenues.
 "Civil servants' salaries are being paid late, taxis or day labourers no longer have work, this has an impact on everyone," said Ahmed Abdel Hussein, an official in Basra, a port city near the southern tip of Iraq.
 "I'm thinking of all the children who this year will not get any presents because of the crisis," he said on the first day of the feast, being celebrated with the country under curfew.
 "Eid used to be the happiest day of the year before, now it's a burden," said another official, Falah, 35, who has two children and an elderly mother to support.
 Shopkeepers and traders, who rely on Eid al-Adha for a large part of their annual turnover, are also affected.
 Abu Hassan al-Bazouni, who owns a sheep farm in Basra, has seen sales decline despite the tradition of sacrificing a lamb for the feast.
 Apart from high unemployment, "this year, confinement has prevented trade from one province to another, so sheep prices have increased," he told AFP.
 In a survey by the International Rescue Committee, 73 percent of Iraqis said they were eating less to save money, while more than 60 percent had taken loans to make ends meet.
 Said Attiya, who runs a clothes store, said business was down 95 percent on last year.
 For Eid in 2019, he hired eight vendors. This year, he is on his own, opening the store only five hours a day.
 Many other stores in Basra, he said, have closed "because you can't import anything and many can't even pay the rent".
 For Ahmed Nejem, another resident, it's hard to stay at home during the holidays, traditionally a time for family gatherings.
 "This year, we're not going out and we can't even buy for presents for the kids," he said.
 Animated messages, most decorated with flowers, others jokes, sent on social media apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook have taken the place of family visits.
 In one such animation, a sheep, spared the slaughter because of costs, merrily sings: "We are celebrating with our masks. It's Eid, I'm wearing my gloves. It's Eid and I won't kiss anyone."

Congress gets nowhere on stimulus — Seems certain now that expanded unemployment benefits will expire at the end of the day just as the labor market is showing new signs of slumping with the second week in a row of higher initial jobless claims after months of declines. There is no question allowing these benefits to expire will deliver a further blow to the economy, as our Rebecca Rainey and Eleanor Mueller report. The expiration will mean less spending on food and other items and higher default rates.

Browne’s basketball career quickly took off. In 2018, the 16-year-old made her debut for the Canadian national team at the U18 FIBA Americas Championship in Mexico City, averaging 8.8 minutes, 4.0 points and 3.0 rebounds per game en route to the silver medal.
 Last August, Browne led Quebec to the U17 national championship, earning MVP honors. It was a preview of the high school season that would follow.
 School ends at grade 11 in Quebec, so Browne left E.S. Saint-Laurent in search of a chance to play in the United States for two years in preparation for college.
 “I decided the best way for me to get exposure for colleges and play with girls I would be playing with and against at the college level would be to play in the States,” said Browne, who was ranked No. 75 in the class of 2021 by ESPN HoopGurlz.
 She landed at Winston-Salem Christian in North Carolina, which offered visas to international students, playing for former Wake Forest standout Delaney Rudd.
 “We’d played against Coach Delaney a lot, and he coaches hard and smart, so that was the kind of coach I wanted to play for,” Browne said.
 She would go on to earn MVP honors as Winston-Salem won the Independent School National Championship, expanding herself and her game in the process.
 “I feel like I was able to learn a lot more about different dynamics on different teams off the court,” Browne said. “The way you interact with teammates off the court has a huge impact on chemistry on the court. It allowed me to grow as an individual and really know this girl I need to talk to this way, not that way. This girl likes to be pushed, this girl needs to be shown instead of talked to.
 “I grew off the court as well as on the court. Defensively, I learned the art of taking charges, and offensively stretched out my game more, knocked down some 3s, attacked off the bounce and didn’t just focus on the inside game, which I’m continually working on.”
 Browne was still pointing toward the class of 2021 until the pandemic and did not make the decision to reclassify to 2020 until the last three weeks. It was, admittedly, driven by the circumstances.
 “It was due to the fact I would not be covered by insurance to return to Winston-Salem due to COVID, and that was a risk I wasn’t willing to take,” she said. “I didn’t want to risk my health plus the spread of COVID, so being able to go to college where things are more controlled with NCAA regulations, I felt that was the safest decision and best decision for me.”
 In a way, Browne will still be a part of IU’s 2021 recruiting class, as she plans to redshirt this year.
 “By redshirting, I’ll able to gain experience on and off the court, get stronger and smarter as far as basketball is concerned,” Browne said. “I can get acclimated to college life, essentially. Hopefully, it will give me a lot of advantages.”
 On the court, Browne sees herself as a power forward for the Hoosiers, a complementary piece to Big Ten All-Freshman Team member Mackenzie Holmes. Holmes and fellow rising sophomore Hannah Noveroske were among those speaking to Browne regularly.
 “I see myself more of a four or a stretch four,” Browne said. “Can I play the five? Yes. Will I at the next level? Well, I’m 6-2 on a good day, so I have to accept these 6-6 girls don’t want this 6-2 girl hanging around. I’ve accepted that if I want to excel, I need to get more ball handling in, be quicker, get more shots up from outside and 3, and I hope that IU will help me with that.
 “I’ve watched a lot of film on Mackenzie and Coach Rhet (Wierzba) and Coach Box have shown me a lot of her games. She’s a very good player, and I feel like I’ll learn a lot from her.”
 Browne hopes to get to do that in person once some of the logistics in leaving Canada for Bloomington are worked out, but she’s confident in the homework that’s been done.
 “The way IU so far has opened their arms and has welcomed me is amazing, and I haven’t even met them in person,” she said.

Following the shooting, police searched a wooded area nearby where one suspect had apparently fled. A police helicopter police helped in that search while police dogs scoured the area in the city about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Chicago, WLS-TV reported.
 Hammond detectives used a fire truck to search the roof of an apartment building for evidence, while the FBI assisted police at the shooting shooting scene, where police had marked at least 10 shell casings.
 Neighbor Ariel McBounds called the shooting was “devastating” and said she feels for the girl’s mother.
 “I can only imagine what she’s going through and how she’s feeling,” McBounds told WLS-TV.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska - An infamous bus appears headed to a new home at a museum in Fairbanks after being removed from Alaska’s backcountry to deter people from making dangerous, sometimes deadly treks to visit the site where a young man documented his demise in 1992.
 The state Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that it intends to negotiate with the University of Alaska’s Museum of the North to display the bus, which was popularized by the book “Into the Wild” and a movie of the same name and flown from its location near Denali National Park and Preserve last month.
 “Of the many expressions of interest in the bus, the proposal from the UA Museum of the North best met the conditions we at DNR had established to ensure this historical and cultural object will be preserved in a safe location where the public could experience it fully, yet safely and respectfully, and without the spectre of profiteering,” Natural Resources Commissioner Corri Feige said in a statement.
