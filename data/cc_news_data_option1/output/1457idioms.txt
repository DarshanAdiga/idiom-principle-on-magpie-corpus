We end up alone on the couch on a Monday evening, eating chocolates and bingeing Netflix because it "didn't work out" again, all while blaming ourselves for it. But in doing so, we are also blinding ourselves to the millions of possibilities that are out there, simply because we were too focused on the ideal love to see the other types of love that were there all along.

“The important thing for New Yorkers to know is that in the city currently, their risk is low and our city preparedness is high,” Barbot said. “We know that this virus can be transmitted from one individual to another, but that it is typically people who live together. There is no risk at this point in time…about having it being transmitted in casual contact.” Earlier in the month, Barbot encouraged residents to attend the Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown. The neighborhood had seen a sharp drop in business as the coronavirus engulfed the city of Wuhan, with China subsequently locking down much of the country.

Those pushing for deeper change may have an ally in Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane, a 10-year SMART board member. Zane, who in March lost her own reelection bid, is calling for additional oversight of the agency, greater transparency to meet voters’ demands and an end to what she called the board’s “rubber-stamp” leadership.
 “The board looks like it’s been too much of a rubber-stamp board. It has, and it’s been frustrating,” Zane said. “We need people to ask tough questions. And staff has to be more transparent, no doubt about it. You can’t ask tough questions … if you don’t have facts about what they’ve done.”
 The Measure I vote came in the wake of a monthslong stand last year by SMART officials, led by Mansourian, to withhold daily ridership data, information they contended they did not have and were not required to produce. In late December, SMART reversed course and disclosed the detailed ridership figures.
 Lucan acknowledged before the March 3 election that the stance had done damage to public trust in the agency.
 Since the election, however, the coronavirus shutdown has proven the more immediate emergency, with shelter-in-place orders that have suddenly reshaped public transit. SMART canceled weekend service and last week cut its weekday service by half to account for a loss of more than 90% of its ridership.
 Between forgone fares and slumping sales tax receipts during the shutdown, SMART projects revenue losses of $11 million, or about a quarter of its annual budget, through the summer, according to an agency spokeswoman. The recent federal stimulus package, will make up some of those losses with roughly $1.3 billion in emergency aid for Bay Area public transit. An announcement about SMART’s share of that package is expected later this week.
 On Wednesday, board members are slated to meet online and begin making decisions that will affect future service and management. The process will take time and be painful, directors said, but they acknowledged it is necessary.
 “We just lost by more than 10%, so obviously something needs to change,” said Santa Rosa Councilman Chris Rogers, a SMART board member. “A lot of these reforms we’ll be looking at should be geared toward an honest assessment about what transit can do and what it’s going to take to get there. ‘So was this pie in the sky?’ And then be honest about what we can deliver and when we can deliver it as soon as possible. Voters deserve that and voters expect that.”
