Harry Maguire admits there was an air of crisis around Old Trafford following the devastating defeat to Tottenham, but the Manchester United captain is certain things are now back on track. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side were under immense scrutiny during the October internationals in the wake of their shock 6-1 defeat at the hands of Jose Mourinho's Spurs.But players kicked on rather than wilted, with United hitting the ground upon their return to action by winning at Newcastle before Marcus Rashford sealed victory at last season's Champions League finalists Paris St Germain. A week on from that triumph in Paris - and days after drawing 0-0 with Chelsea - the 22-year-old again starred, grabbing his first senior hat-trick as RB Leipzig were stunned 5-0 at an empty Old Trafford. &quot;After Tottenham, we were all devastated,&quot; United captain Maguire said. &quot;We were three games into the season but it felt like we were in a big crisis. &quot;It was quite a strange feeling, but we don't expect to lose games at Old Trafford - and we definitely don't expect to lose games like we did. &quot;The first three games we were conceding far too many chances, so as a defensive unit, having kept the most clean sheets in Europe last year, we knew we had to improve, we had to be more solid. &quot;We've worked hard on the training ground and I think since the international break we have gone back to not conceding chances like we wasn't last year - we were a solid unit and we played from a solid base. &quot;It has been really important - as a defender especially - to make sure that we give the front lads every opportunity to go and win the game. &quot;They score one, two, three goals, it should end up in a win and we're doing that at the moment. &quot;It's a start. It's still early on this season. It is going to be a long journey but we've got to improve. We know that and we are doing so at the minute, but a long way to go.&quot; United have certainly ended the month in a way few could have foreseen when Jose Mourinho's men ran amok at Old Trafford on October 4. Similarly, nobody would have predicted the 5-0 thumping of last season's Champions League semi-finalists Leipzig, especially with Solskjaer's side only a goal up when Rashford came off the bench. &quot;Marcus has been brilliant,&quot; Maguire said of the hat-trick hero on a night when Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial also scored. &quot;Obviously the manager has put him on the bench tonight, maybe a little rest and it's worked wonders in the end. &quot;Obviously bringing him on when you're up against it as a defender, you've got Anto to deal with throughout the night and then you see Marcus lined up to come on. &quot;It must be a defender's nightmare for them and he's come on and he's made a big impact in the game and he's thoroughly deserved his three goals.&quot; Wednesday was also a particularly-memorable night for Champions League debutant Maguire, who admits he would never have dreamt of playing on this stage five years ago, never mind leading United out at Old Trafford. But the 27-year-old is not content to just be part of Europe's elite. &quot;We want be successful in the knockout stages, that's the standards and expectations we have set,&quot; he said - and is looking to end this frantic period with more positive results,&quot; he said. &quot;It is going to be a strange season, where games are coming every three, four days and it's really important that you rest, recover,&quot; Maguire told MUTV as United prepare for matches against Arsenal and Everton either side of the trip to Istanbul Basaksehir. &quot;It's nice obviously for the gaffer to have such great squad depth to choose from. &quot;You've seen tonight he's made five changes and it hasn't altered us. &quot;Credit to the boys and the boys who haven't been playing, keeping themselves fit and fresh and working hard day in, day out in training because it's a group effort. &quot;We are going to need everyone this year if we want to be successful and win games. It is really important.&quot;

At least 140 Europe-bound migrants drowned off the coast of Senegal when their boat caught fire and capsized, marking the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year, the U.N. migration agency said on Thursday. The boat carrying 200 people sank a few hours after leaving the fishing town of Mbour, 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital Dakar, on Saturday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.Video shared on local media showed a rescue boat of local fishermen approaching a thick column of dark smoke in the open ocean, as people swam frantically towards them.The Senegalese and Spanish navies and fishermen rescued some 60 people, but &quot;at least 140 people have drowned&quot;, IOM said in a statement.Migrant arrivals in the Canary Islands from West Africa have more than quadrupled so far this year to around 11,000 compared with the same period in 2019, IOM said.The surge has happened as other more favoured routes through Libya or Algeria, and across the Mediterranean Sea to southern Europe, have become blocked off by tougher controls.The perilous sea passage to the Canary Islands was once a more popular route. Attempts became scarcer when Spain stepped up patrols in the mid-2000s.But with fewer options, migrants seeking an escape from poverty or conflict are again taking the longer, 1,400-km (870-mile) sea route to the Spanish islands off the Moroccan coast, often in rickety, overcrowded boats with unreliable engines.Fourteen boats carrying 663 migrants left Senegal for the islands in September, over a quarter of which experienced an incident or shipwreck, the IOM said.

Nitish Kumar, Bihar's Sushan babu, the poster child of good governance, credited with engineering a governance miracle that delivered rapid growth in Bihar, faces his electorate today a diminished man, with his governance miracle a thing of the past.The shifting dynamics of political party competition, a potential churn in existing social equations, and Kumar's political missteps have excited much commentary. Missing in the analysis of his fading political star is any serious engagement with Kumar's now fading good governance, itself a product of a complex political economy. Embedded here are important lessons in the dynamics of politics and State capacity, and the limits they place on governance reforms. The success of Bihar's new government (even with Kumar at its helm) will depend on its ability to navigate this political economy.To understand the emergence (and subsequent stagnation) of Kumar's governance reforms, it is important to go back to Lalu Prasad and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) years. Prasad's politics of caste empowerment paid scant attention to governance. In fact, as Jeffery Witsoe has argued, the governance breakdown was by design, part of the political project of lower caste empowerment that sought to challenge the dominance of upper caste bureaucrats in State institutions.In an insightful paper, former bureaucrat Santosh Mathew and co-authors, offer systematic evidence of how this was achieved. RJD governments carefully avoided appointing upper caste officials, preferring to leave positions vacant if suitable candidates from the Yadav electoral coalition could not be identified. Central funds for implementing government schemes were under-claimed and unspent. For instance, between 1996 and 2006, a mere 30,000 primary school teachers were recruited, despite central government pressure and financing to fill 90,000 sanctioned teacher positions. Power was transferred to local politicians through the chief minister, stripping bureaucrats of significant decision-making authority by deploying complex red tape and encouraging political interference. The result was the creation of new networks of Yadav patronage at the grassroots and an administration stripped of capacity. Both governance and State capacity were collateral damage in the politics of empowerment. Kumar rode to power in 2005 on the back of a new social alliance and a promise of governance and redistributive development. His unique alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s upper caste supporters and the disparate group of non-dominant lower castes (the extremely backward classes and mahadalits) freed him from the constraints Prasad faced. Witose argues that the alliance with the upper castes enabled him to wrest power back from politicians to bureaucrats with relatively little resistance and aggressively pursue a governance agenda. Kumar, thus, was able to concentrate on recapacitating the administration. Fiscal transfers from the Centre increased. The administration was slowly repopulated, albeit never to full capacity -- in key areas of administration Bihar still has very high vacancy rate. This has now become the basis for the RJD's one million government jobs election promise. In his first seven years in power though, Kumar recruited over 300,000 primary school teachers and strengthened the police force (which contributed to restoring law and order). The results were palpable. In education, for instance, in 2005, Bihar reported among the highest percentage of girls who were out of school. By 2011, the proportion of children out of school was lower than the national average and the gender gap had all but disappeared.But this strategy of recapacitating administration and engineering an early governance miracle had inherent limitations. Like Prasad, Kumar centralised power within the Chief Minister's Office, but unlike the RJD, relied heavily on a set of top bureaucrats. His strategy sought to remove politics from governance and free senior bureaucrats from political patronage. But in doing so, it failed to mobilise a political constituency that could challenge patronage networks at the grassroots. Corruption and patronage remained entrenched and schemes like MGNREGA suffered. Crucially, this model by design could not engineer deep structural grassroots administrative reforms, necessary for long-term change.I witnessed this first-hand, while studying the education reforms in the 2010-2015 phase. The top-down bureaucratic approach successfully managed to expand the primary school network and innovate. The Mukhyamantri cycle yojna to incentivise girls to go to secondary school has now been widely replicated across the country. But when it came to building on these gains -- ensuring teacher accountability and improving learning outcomes -- the system found itself flailing, despite the CM's commitment. His model for good governance was not designed for structural change. This is why his third term has been bereft of new ideas and serious change. The governance miracle stagnated.Crucially, this bureaucrat- led approach undermined Kumar's ability to mobilise a political constituency around his development model and leverage his early success to widen his political base. The importance of political mobilisation is what the BJP has understood well. Every new scheme, every governance tool is deployed politically. Ironically, this is a model Modi developed after the 2015 Bihar debacle.In seeking to rid governance of politics, Nitish Kumar has arguably lost his only significant political weapon. The rise and subsequent stagnation of Bihar's governance model is also a reminder that ultimately the quest for good governance and State capacity is about politics, even if politics is the reason governance in India suffers.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive, Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal

NEW YORK (AP) — Exxon Mobil is slashing 1,900 jobs from its U.S. workforce as the pandemic continues to sap demand for fuel. The Irving,Texas-based oil giant said the reductions will be both voluntary and involuntary and will largely come from its management offices in Houston. The oil industry has been struggling all year after prices fell well below what producers need to break even. As the pandemic gripped the U.S. economy and demand for fuel plummeted, Exxon announced in March that it would cut expenses by 30%. The company recently announced it would cut about 1,600 jobs in Europe and it began a voluntary staff reduction program in Australia. It is also evaluating potential job cuts in Canada.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Jerry Falwell Jr. has sued Liberty University, alleging the evangelical school founded by his late pastor father damaged his reputation in a series of public statements that followed his resignation as president and chancellor in August amid a series of scandals.The lawsuit filed in Lynchburg Circuit Court on Wednesday includes claims of defamation and breach of contract. It alleges that Liberty officials accepted what Falwell says are false claims about his involvement in an extramarital affair between his wife and a business partner of the couple’s and “moved quickly” to destroy his reputation. “When Mr. Falwell and his family became the targets of a malicious smear campaign incited by anti- evangelical forces, Liberty University not only accepted the salacious and baseless accusations against the Falwells at face value, but directly participated in the defamation. This action seeks redress for the damage Liberty has caused to the reputation of Mr. Falwell and his family,” the lawsuit says. K. Todd Swisher, Circuit Court clerk for the city of Lynchburg, provided The Associated Press with a copy of the complaint, which contains a limited number of redactions in sections pertaining to Falwell’s employment agreement. Swisher said there would be a hearing within a week for a judge to consider whether an unredacted version of the complaint should remain sealed. Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb said the school, which had not yet been served with the lawsuit, would have a formal statement in response later Thursday. The school’s board of trustees has been meeting this week.An attorney for Falwell did not respond immediately to a telephone message left Thursday, and Falwell did not respond to a voicemail and text seeking comment. Falwell left Liberty in August after Giancarlo Granda, a younger business partner of the Falwell family, said he had a yearslong sexual relationship with Falwell’s wife, Becki Falwell, and that Jerry Falwell participated in some of the liaisons as a voyeur. Although the Falwells have acknowledged that Granda and Becki Falwell had an affair, Jerry Falwell has denied any participation. The couple allege that Granda sought to extort them by threatening to reveal the relationship unless he was paid substantial amounts of money.Before his resignation, Falwell had already been on an indefinite leave of absence after an uproar over a photo he posted on social media of him and his wife’s pregnant assistant, both with their pants unzipped. Falwell said it was taken in good fun at a costume party during a vacation, but critics saw it as evidence of hypocrisy by the head of an institution that holds students to a strict moral code of conduct.Shortly after Falwell’s departure, Liberty announced it was opening an independent investigation into his tenure as president, a wide-ranging inquiry that would include financial, real estate and legal matters.Earlier this month, the school identified Baker Tilly US as the firm handling the investigation and announced the launch of a website to “facilitate the reporting of potential misconduct to the investigative team.”Falwell has declined to answer questions from the AP about the size of the exit package he received from the university but has discussed the issue with other news organizations, which reported that he was set to receive $10.5 million. However, Liberty said in a statement last month that it paid Falwell two years of base salary and disputed “media reports regarding the size and terms” of Falwell’s contract.In an August interview with the AP, Falwell said that the school’s board had been “very generous to me” but raised concerns that they were “being influenced by people who really shouldn’t have a say” about the future direction of Liberty.In the lawsuit, Falwell claimed that Liberty “turned on” him after Granda went public with his allegations, forcing his resignation. The lawsuit also says Liberty rejected Falwell’s attempts “to reach an amicable resolution,” forcing Falwell to turn to court to “restore his reputation.”The lawsuit says Liberty’s statements have harmed not only Falwell’s reputation but also his future employment prospects and business opportunities. Falwell now has a “drastically reduced ability” to attach his name to business and charity organizations, and he has stopped receiving previously frequent invitations to appear on TV to discuss Liberty, evangelicalism and politics, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit further alleges that “Liberty’s actions are antithetical to the teachings of Christ.” Falwell’s attorneys charge the university with hurting its own standing and that of the broader evangelical community “by playing right into the hands of sinister operatives with ulterior motives.”Falwell’s acrimonious departure from Liberty came four years after his endorsement helped burnish the reputation of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump among conservative evangelical Protestants. That group has since become a critical part of the president’s political base. The public Falwell-Trump alliance that marked 2016 is not visible in this year’s election, as the president looks to other prominent evangelical surrogates.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

The HSE revealed today that attendances at emergency departments are down again and the number of patients admitted to a ward through this route has also fallen by 7.7pc.It comes amid continuing worry that there could also be a lag in the numbers of patients with Covid-19 who need to be hospitalised.They could potentially rise significantly despite signals that the national outbreak may be starting to get under control.More older people are being infected with Covid-19 and they are at most risk of complications.Covid-19 hospitalisations are predominantly among middle aged and older patients.There are currently 330 Covid-19 patients in hospital and 42 are in intensive care.HSE clinical director Dr Colm Henry said overall the hospital system is &ldquo;stable and coping&rdquo; with Covid-19 cases and surge capacity has not had to be used so far.But we are ever only &ldquo;two weeks&rdquo; from being overwhelmed..Referring to the drop in A&amp;E attendances – which may have been impacted by the bank holiday – he reassured people that emergency departments are &ldquo;safe places.&rdquo;He appealed to the public to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo; as the impact of restrictions start to kick in.Earlier, HSE chief Paul Reid said despite the apparent reduction in Covid-19 spread it is too early to say that it is a &ldquo;sustainable trend.&rdquo;There has been a reduction in the positivity rate for the first time in months and it is now at 5.9pc.Of the 346 patients admitted to hospital between October 13 and 26, 19 were admitted to intensive care.The 14-day incidence of the infection has fallen and there has been a larger reduction in the past seven days.Meanwhile, HSE executive Liam Woods said that around four or five residential centres,including nursing homes are in the red zone which means they are getting intensive support.Another 35 are in an amber zone where they are getting a lower level of support.Over 80pc are managing fine, he added.

His other project for Fox also scratches that itch — a scripted series he describes as a country version of "Empire meets Desperate Housewives" that will be more "over the top" than the ABC/CMT drama Nashville. "I wanted to create [a series] that was not so inside-baseball like Nashville was," says Owen, who adds that the soundtrack won't follow Nashville's template of original songs but rather interpret country hits of the Eighties, Nineties, and 2000s. "It will be older country music, but reimagined a little bit like Glee."

NEW YORK (AP) — Exxon Mobil is slashing 1,900 jobs from its U.S. workforce as the pandemic saps demand for fuel. The Irving, Texas, oil giant said the reductions will be both voluntary and involuntary and will largely come from its management offices in Houston. The company had about 75,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2019. The oil industry has been struggling all year after prices fell well below what producers need to break even. As the pandemic gripped the U.S. economy and demand for fuel plummeted, Exxon announced in March that it would cut expenses by 30%. In a meeting with employees last week, CEO Darren Woods said the company is exceeding the spending reductions it announced in March, deferring more than $10 billion in capital expenses and cutting 15% of cash operating expenses. The company recently announced it would cut about 1,600 jobs in Europe and it began a voluntary staff reduction program in Australia. It is also evaluating potential job cuts in Canada.

"Arable gives me everything I need, all hours of the day, to stay in touch with our crew and make data-driven decisions," says Charles Dietzel of Carolina Heritage Farms, in North Carolina. As a seventh-generation family farmer, Dietzel is always on the lookout for technology that optimizes their operation. “We reduced our watering by more than 50% compared to last year, which also reduced our risk of fusarium from overwatering. Arable has a tremendous advantage over others in the Ag IoT space—from integration with industry leaders like Netafim and Sentek, to technology, to customer support, to ease of use—and I'll tell anyone that, hands down."
