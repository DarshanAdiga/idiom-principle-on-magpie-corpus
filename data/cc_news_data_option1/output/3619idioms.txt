JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Paul Rusesabagina sounded strained. The man who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda” for saving people from genocide but is now accused of terrorism in Rwanda was speaking to his family for the first time since being paraded in handcuffs on Aug. 31. But something was wrong.With Rwandan authorities listening in, it was clear Rusesabagina wasn’t allowed to speak openly on the phone call, said Brian Endless, part of the international team trying to defend him.It remains a mystery how Rusesabagina disappeared from a trip to Dubai late last month and appeared in custody in a country his family says he would never return to voluntarily.“Paul briefly mentioned boarding a plane on the call, but this was strained and he cut off the discussion immediately after. We have no idea if this was Paul speaking freely or coerced,” Endless told The Associated Press. In comments to the BBC, he said Rusesabagina mentioned waking up on the plane to find himself in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali.Endless said Rwandan officials also attended a meeting between Belgian officials and Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen and U.S. permanent resident.The uncertainties around his arrest have led Human Rights Watch to assert that the 66-year-old Rusesabagina, long an outspoken critic of the Rwandan government, was “forcibly disappeared.” In a statement released late Thursday, the organization said Rwandan authorities should urgently explain how he was apprehended and taken to the East African country.“The fact that Rwanda did not pursue Rusesabagina through lawful extradition proceedings suggests the authorities do not believe their evidence or fair trial guarantees would stand up to scrutiny before an independent tribunal, and so opted to circumvent the rule of law,” the group’s Central Africa director, Lewis Mudge, said.Rusesabagina’s legal team, which has not been able to speak with him, believes he boarded a private plane operated by GainJet, which has been used by the Rwandan government and has an office in the capital, Kigali. The legal team points to publicly available flight records.It is not clear what the flight plan or passenger list say, and GainJet’s CEO Ramsey Shaban has not responded to a request for comment. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates, home of the Dubai city-state, have not responded to questions.Human Rights Watch asserted that “Rusesabagina was in the custody of the Rwandans or their proxies as of the night of Aug. 27 but his detention was not acknowledged by the Rwandans until Aug. 31.”Rwandan President Paul Kagame in a nationally televised interview Sunday indicated that Rusesabagina might have been tricked into boarding a plane to a country he hasn’t lived in since 1996. “It was actually flawless!” Kagame said, suggesting that “he brought himself — even if he may not have intended it.”Rusesabagina became famous for protecting more than 1,000 people as a hotel manager during Rwanda’s 1994 genocide in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. For his efforts he was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.But Rwandan authorities accuse him of supporting the armed wing of his opposition political platform, which has claimed responsibility for deadly attacks inside Rwanda. They point to a video posted online in 2018 in which he expresses support for the National Liberation Front and says “the time has come for us to use any means possible to bring about change in Rwanda, as all political means have been tried and failed.”Rusesabagina in the past has denied funding rebel groups and said he was being targeted over his criticism of Kagame’s government and alleged rights abuses.Rwanda’s government has changed its account of Rusesabagina’s arrest and has not allowed him access to legal counsel of his choosing or any confidential consultations, Human Rights Watch said. The group for years has documented cases of critics of Rwanda’s government being killed overseas, apprehended under unclear circumstances or dying behind bars.“In Rwanda, history over the past 20-plus years shows that there is unfortunately a wide variety of things that the Rwandan government can do beyond prison,” said Endless, a U.S.-based professor. “We are very concerned that Paul could be disappeared at any time or could suffer a health crisis manufactured by the Rwandan government.”Rwanda’s government has long denied alleged abuses, and its supporters point to the country’s widely praised development and stability since the genocide.Rusesabagina has not appeared in court. His file was handed over to prosecutors on Wednesday. Rwandan law says a suspect can be in provisional detention for 15 days, renewable for up to 90 days.Rwanda’s prosecutor general, Aimable Havugiyaremye, told the AP that Rusesabagina is still being interrogated and a court date is yet to be announced.Rusesabagina’s legal team has filed a complaint with the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, and the office is “moving forward with their procedures,” Endless said. The office told the AP it could not comment.___Ignatius Ssuuna in Kigali, Rwanda, contributed.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Andre Kajlich doesn't have any recollection of what happened. He remembers having breakfast with his friends and then getting on the subway train. Three weeks later, he woke up.
 It was December 2003 and Kajlich was going to school in the Czech Republic when a night out partying changed his life forever. He had breakfast before getting on the subway for the trip home, but fell asleep during the ride.
 "I woke up three weeks later in the hospital," Kajlich said.
 He apparently stumbled off the train and missed a step, falling down into the tracks, he said, "and the whole train ran over me."
 "I was in the ICU for two months," Kajlich said. "I lost both my legs, had a lacerated liver, broke all my ribs on the right side, punctured my lung, was on a ventilator and a breathing tube and was in a coma for three weeks. It was a pretty close call."
 Kajlich survived with a new outlook on life, choosing to do all he could with what he had. Despite one leg requiring amputation at the hip and the other above the knee, he immediately sought to challenge himself in whatever way possible.
 That quest continues this week when Kajlich and three other athletes from the Challenged Athletes Foundation attempt to finish the Idaho Smoke 'n' Fire 400, a grueling 400-plus mile self-supported mountain bike route through the Idaho wilderness.
 The race started early Wednesday from Hyde Park in Boise, and competitors will finish at the same spot sometime between Friday and Sunday.
 "We're always looking for things to train and to extend our range and capabilities and something off road and on bikes is something none of us really have a ton of experience with," said. "We're certainly up to the endurance challenge that is involved, but it's new terrain and that got us excited about it."
 Mohamed Lana (single leg amputation due to a pelvis, hop and femur disorder), Lucas Onan (underdeveloped left arm due to anthrogryposis) and "One Arm Willie" Stewart (lost an arm in a construction accident) will compete alongside Kajlich. The four will ride as a group and attempt to make history together.
 Other competitors in the race don't face the same challenges as the four from CAF and many of them still struggle to finish the course. Kajlich faces the toughest road due to his 3-wheeled hand cycle.
 "There's not a good vehicle for me for off road and that much climbing and that much distance," said. "On a hand cycle, the 'hike a bike' section where people get off and walk their bikes will present a big challenge. I'll definitely lean on my team for that. The steep dirt will also make it hard to get traction because a hand cycle has front wheel drive as opposed to a regular bike that has rear wheel drive and better traction going up."
 An adaptive athlete has never even attempted the race, let alone finish it. The course is 90-percent off road on either fire roads or single track paths. It's all self-supported, meaning every racer will bring with them what they need in terms of food and water and supplies. They have just five days to ride more than 400 miles.
 "It far exceeds perseverance," the foundation's Idaho director Jenn Skeesick said. "The fascinating thing about our athletes is what they've already pushed through in their life and do on a daily basis; it really kind of prepares them for the mental piece of trying to take on something like this.
 "Whatever success looks like, whether it's doing it in five days like the race says or just showing up at the starting line and giving it a good shot, it's the same for everybody," Skeesick said. "They are all trying to finish it, but the mental tenacity that is ingrained in our athletes, they've done hard. They do hard every day. And this is something they love doing."
 The course must be completed in five days, but the group hopes to make it in as little as three days. That will mean rest stops of less than two hours to eat and nap.
 "We want to really see how quickly we can do this," Kajlich said. "We want to push 24 hours off the front, maybe lay down for 90 minutes, get up and do it again, and see if we can squeeze this into three days. The 'hike a bike' sections are just going to be slow. We're just going to face what we face and get out there and figure out. The plan is when we hit those sections Mohamed and Lucas will take their bikes across and then come back for my bike and I'll just start my crawl. I'm not worried about the terrain, it's more about the speed that we can pull it off. Some parts will be slow."
 The Challenged Athletes Foundation provides support for those with physical limitations through a grant program that provides the equipment, coaching and travel expenses to make it to the starting line. The rest is up to them.
 CAF partnered with Mission 43 for this year's race. Mission 43 is based out of Idaho and focuses on empowering veterans as they transition from military to civilian life. Two active members of the Idaho National Guard will tackle the race with the CAF athletes and be there to assist if needed during hard parts of the course such as a boulder pass or the "hike a bike" section.
 "They will only help if its needed, but otherwise its on every person to get themselves through the race," Skeesick said. "It's the first time for all six of them. None of them have ever attempted this race before so there's a lot of unknowns out there. I'm really excited for them and to hear the stories about it when they get back."
 Kajlich has done similar challenges in the past. In 2017 he rode 3,100 miles across the country in 12 days, taking just a few short hours off at a time. He also did a 62-hour straight off-road race in Brazil in an off-road wheelchair that included a 33,000-foot elevation climb in just 135 miles.
 He's in the middle of a journey to become the first person to cross every continent from the lowest to highest points of elevation.
 It's all part of his goal to make the most of things and not let his physical limitations hold him back.
 "I'm just trying to maximize the ability I still have," Kajlich said. "The accident taught me that I'm capable of so much more and seeing the unknown and the fear and the uncertainty of the situation and coming out the other side left me with some important life lessons and really a better understanding of myself and how my mind works.
 "This won't be easy. It's difficult. But if me being out there rubs off on anyone else then that's great. I think by living your life to the fullest that's the best way to set an example."
 Kajlich and the CAF team are hoping to reach the finish line at Hyde Park Saturday evening, but they have until Sunday to complete the course. Their progress can be tracked at trackleaders.com/smokenfire20.

The Branson Board of Aldermen voted to extend the city's face-covering ordinance Tuesday evening until Oct. 14, but not before more than a dozen people spoke against the mandate.
   
 All aldermen were present for the 5-1 vote.
   
 Prior to voting, the board heard from about 13 people who opposed the face- covering ordinance and two in support.
   
 Bill Large was the first to speak, calling the board's decision to pass the mandate "draconian."
   
 "COVID is not the big bad wolf everyone says it is," Large said. "This (mask) is a joke to me. It does not prevent COVID-19."
   
 Audrey Richards, who is running as an independent candidate in the 7th District Congressional race, spoke in support of a mask mandate.
   
 "As a Branson resident, I feel safer," Richards said. "This is about public safety."
   
 Joshua Pope also spoke in favor of the face-covering mandate. Pope said he was diagnosed with COVID-19 a few weeks ago.
   
 "Everyone who supports this knows these are not 100 percent invincible," Pope said. "COVID was not bad for me, but what wasn't bad for me might be bad for you and you."
   
 Entertainer Clay Cooper said folks in Branson were more afraid of losing their livelihood than they were of catching COVID-19.
   
 Then, in an apparent effort to show how little he feared the virus, Cooper told the board he would kiss alderman Bill Skains "in the mouth" if Cooper thought Skains had COVID-19.
   
 "And I don't even like men," he added.
   
 Russell Eugene said he was "forced into early retirement" because of the ordinance.
   
 "I was having hallucinations at work because of a lack of oxygen to my brain," Eugene said. "You have destroyed the economy of this city."
   
 One woman said she knows of people who have died from wearing a mask, but said she doesn't know anyone who has died of COVID-19.
   
 "This is not a pandemic," the woman said. "This is a forced-upon-America lie."
   
 Another man told the board they would be responsible for all of the deaths caused by masks.
   
 Glen Meyer asked the board if any of them were being compensated for passing the face-covering mandate.
   
 "It's not your job to oversee my health," Meyer told the board.
   
 In preparation for the vote, the board heard information from the Taney County Health Department and a tourism market researcher at a special study session last week.
   
 Before voting against extending the ordinance Tuesday, Alderman Larry Milton took off his mask and accused Mayor Edd Akers of not inviting experts who oppose mask mandates to the study session.
   
 According to information presented at the study session, most Branson travelers (84 percent) say they are more likely or just as likely to visit places with mask mandates. Those who are more likely to (46 percent) outnumber those less likely (16 percent) by a margin of nearly three to one.
   
 Lisa Marshall, director of the Taney County Health Department, also presented information at the study session.
   
 Marshall told the board that Taney County has a higher number of cases per 100,000 people than Greene County. Through Wednesday, Taney County had 1,775 cases per 100,000 residents while Greene County had 1,433.
   
 The highest rate in the state is McDonald County, with 4,379 per 100,000 and the lowest is in St. Clair County, with 319.
   
 As of July 30, 70 percent of Taney County's cases were Branson residents, Marshall said. As of Sept. 3, that number has dropped to 61 percent.
   
 At the study session, Marshall presented the board with a graph that shows the number of new cases reported from July 1 to Aug. 25. The date the mask mandate went into effect (July 31) is marked and an orange line indicates the seven- day rolling average, which has been declining since July 31.
   
 "This shows you what has happened since that ordinance took place," Marshall said last week. "Anecdotally from what my office has seen, at one point we were seeing 40 cases a day. We are now down to maybe 10 or 15."

OLYMPIA — Benton County Sheriff Jerry Hatcher’s request to stop the recall effort against him will be considered Nov. 5 by all nine justices of the Washington state Supreme Court.
 The high court’s deputy clerk notified attorneys for both Hatcher and Jason Erickson — a sheriff’s sergeant who is petitioning to remove his boss from office — and Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller by email letter Thursday saying the court granted an accelerated review of the sheriff’s appeal.
 Erickson and his attorney, Alan Harvey of Vancouver, were asking for the quick turnaround, citing state law dealing with recall efforts of elected public servants.
 At the same time, the court denied a request by Hatcher’s lawyer George Telquist of Richland to allow oral arguments in the matter.
 Thursday’s letter from Deputy Clerk Erin L. Lennon gave Telquist and Harvey deadlines in the coming weeks to file their legal briefs. It was noted that the Nov. 5 conference is a tentative date.
 “In light of this schedule, it is unlikely that extensions of time to file briefs will be granted,” Lennon wrote.
 Erickson seeks to remove Hatcher as sheriff on allegations of criminal misconduct, tampering with physical evidence, discrimination, intimidation and retaliation. He is backed by nearly the entire membership of the Benton County Deputy Sheriff’s Guild.
 In August, Judge M. Scott Wolfram decided Erickson’s petition is legally and factually sufficient to proceed to a special election.
 The judge approved the entire proposed ballot synopsis prepared by Benton County prosecutors, which includes charges of misfeasance, malfeasance and violations of Hatcher’s oath of office.
 Wolfram, of Walla Walla County Superior Court, presided over the matter because of a conflict with Benton-Franklin Superior Court judges.
 Following the judge’s decision, Telquist vowed to appeal it to the state Supreme Court and filed the notice earlier this month.
 Hatcher has been sheriff since May 2017 when he was picked to take over the position after the resignation of Steve Keane.
 As an elected official, Hatcher can only be removed from office in a county election. He also can step down voluntarily before his term is up at the end of 2022.

Analysis
 Steelhead numbers are up this year, but don’t call it a rebound. At least not yet.
 Dam counts and passive integrated transponder, or PIT, tag analysis indicate fish returning to the Snake River this fall and next spring will post their best return in more than three years.
 Through Tuesday, more than 81,400 steelhead had been counted at Bonneville Dam. That is ahead of the 55,800 counted at this time last year and better than the returns of about 66,600 in 2018 and 77,400 in 2017.
 But some context is required. Steelhead returns have been abysmally poor the past three years. While the run is showing improvement in 2020, its projected performance still falls well below the 10-year average of about 173,000. More context: The 10-year average has been shrinking because of the recent poor return years replacing more robust years in the data set. Just four years ago it was 270,000.
 “The last three years are the worst three years since we have seen since collecting PIT tag data,” said Joe DuPont, regional fisheries manager for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game at Lewiston.
 Many steelhead are implanted with the tags that allow fisheries managers to track their progress during their juvenile and adult migrations. In the Fall, DuPont monitors adult PIT tag data as the fish pass Bonneville Dam. For the A-run, he concentrates on steelhead bound for the Sawtooth and Pahsimeroi hatcheries on the upper Salmon River and those bound for steelhead trap at Hells Canyon Dam on the Snake River.
 He said about 13,000 A-run steelhead bound for the hatcheries have been detected passing Bonneville Dam.
 “That is plenty to meet our broodstock needs,” he said. “That is why we went with a two-fish limit.”
 Returns were so poor that bag limits on the Snake, Salmon and Little Salmon rivers were cut to just one hatchery steelhead in the falls of 2019 and 2018. The normal bag limit on those rivers is three per day.
 The A-run, as measured at Bonneville Dam, is about 85 percent complete, based on historic run timing. DuPont said between 14,000 and 16,000 A-run steelhead could ultimately return to hatcheries in Idaho.
 “That is more than we have seen in the previous two years, and it’s pretty close to what we had in 2017 (17,600),” he said. “The big difference is this year is 70 percent are two-ocean fish.”
 The A-run is generally dominated by steelhead that spend just one year in the ocean. This year’s dominance of two-ocean steelhead is unusual, but a boon to anglers and hatchery operators alike. The two-ocean fish are bigger, thus they put up more of a fight. The hens also carry many more eggs because of their size, meaning fewer are needed to meet spawning collection goals.
 Predictions for the B-run that returns mostly to the Clearwater River and is made up of fish that usually spend two to three years in the ocean, is a little more tentative. That is because the run, as measured at Bonneville Dam, is just over 20 percent complete, based on historic run timing.
 DuPont noted with 80 percent of the run still to come things could change, but “to date things are looking fairly promising. There is some indication the run may be a littler early or it could just be strong.”
 He said as many as 20,000 to 30,000 hatchery B-run steelhead could eventually pass Bonneville Dam.
 “Last year we had about 5,000, in 2018 we had 18,000 and in 2017 we had 11,000 come over,” he said. “If you look back to 2010 that 20,000- to 30,000-fish run is kind of average. It’s not a great year, but it’s a fair bit above the bad years. It falls within the range of years when we did not have to apply special restrictions to meet broodstock.”
 For more context, in 2016, 37,000 B-run steelhead were counted at Bonneville Dam, and in 2010 45,000 were counted.
 He said if the numbers hold, it’s likely steelhead fishing rules for the Clearwater won’t include size restrictions.
 There also is some promising news for fall chinook and coho. DuPont said it appears the fall chinook run may exceed expectations “but we are not sure if the run is early or just above forecast. Even if they are early, it looks like the run is going to come in at forecast or better.”
 The coho run looks as though it could exceed preseason expectations as well.

_Love Island_ star Zara McDermott and _Made In Chelsea's_ Sam Thompson are the latest celeb couple to call it quits after their relationship reportedly struggled in lockdown. The pair started dating 16 months ago after Zara slid into Sam's DMs, and it looked like things were getting pretty serious, with Sam only recently saying he planned to propose by the end of the year.
 But apparently it wasn't meant to be, as it's being reported that they ended things following a trip to Mykonos at the end of July. A source told Mail Online that their relationship became strained after they moved in together during lockdown.
 "They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them," the source said. "Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Just about the only thing that looked familiar about the NFL’s long-awaited return Thursday was the sight of Patrick Mahomes effortlessly leading the Kansas City Chiefs up and down the field.
 The Super Bowl MVP threw for 211 yards and three touchdowns, and Clyde Edwards-Helaire ran through the rain for 138 yards and another score as the Chiefs began defense of their first championship in 50 years by beating the Houston Texans 34-20 before a physically distanced crowd of about 16,000 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Travis Kelce, Sammy Watkins and Tyreek Hill each caught scoring passes for the Chiefs. They have won 10 consecutive games dating to last season. That run includes a come-from-behind 51-31 victory against the Texans in the AFC divisional round of the playoffs.
 “I’m proud of our players but I’m also proud of our fans. They came out there. They were loud,” said Chiefs coach Andy Reid, who claimed he didn’t notice some booing from fans during a pregame moment of unity involving both teams.
 “Obviously, our players, both sides of the ball and special teams, I thought they were solid. For the first game there were some good things that were done, some great individual performances.”
 The Texans’ Deshaun Watson threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score, but he also was under relentless pressure and was intercepted once. David Johnson provided the biggest bright spot for Houston, running for 77 yards and a score.
 “There’s a lot to fix,” Texans coach Bill O’Brien said. “It’s only one game. We have to improve pretty quickly. But it’s only one game. We have to get back to work pretty soon and fix these things.”
 The world dramatically has changed in the seven months since the Chiefs hoisted the Lombardi Trophy in Miami.
 Within six weeks, the term COVID-19 had become a part of everyday life, the disease killing more than 900,000 people around the world, including almost 190,000 here in the U.S.. The death of George Floyd at the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer in May touched off the Black Lives Matter movement, which in turn has led to a summer of social unrest that has gripped the country.
 Against that backdrop came an NFL opener unlike any other: masks worn by everyone from fans to the coaching staffs; a series of videos raising awareness of social justice initiatives and encouraging the public to vote; and ultimately both teams locking arms in a display of unity prior to the coin toss.
 To the relief of many, kickoff finally brought four hours of normalcy.
 The Texans, who blew a 24-point lead against Kansas City in the playoffs, struck first when they marched 80 yards for a touchdown. The elusive Johnson finished it off by scampering 19 yards to the end zone for a 7-0 lead.
 But just like that cold January day, the red-hot Chiefs quickly overcame their slow start.
 They tied it moments later when Mahomes threw a short touchdown pass to Kelce, then took the lead when they forced a quick punt and Mahomes found Watkins in the end zone. Harrison Butker capped the first half by kicking a chip-shot field goal that sent the Chiefs to the locker room with a 17-7 lead.
 Edwards-Helaire, their first-round pick, padded the lead in the third quarter. After ripping off an 11-yard gain early in the drive, the pint-sized dynamo out of LSU unleashed a wicked stutter-step before running 27 yards for another score.
 “H’es just another weapon I have in this offense,” Mahomes said.
 The Chiefs put the game away when rookie L’Jarius Sneed picked off Watson’s jump ball in the closing seconds of the third quarter. Mahomes was bailed out of a fourth-down interception by pass interference in the end zone, then he zipped a dart to Hill streaking across the field for a 31-7 lead early in the fourth quarter.
 “We just trust whatever coach Reid is dialing up,” said Kelce, who finished with six catches for 50 yards. “They do an unbelievable job preparing us and scheming up defenses and we just trust what they’re doing.”
 Watson threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score later in the quarter to make the final score a bit more respectable.
 “It was a little different but the fans did what they did for their home team and that was pretty much it,” Watson said. “We just got to continue to do our job, find the rhythm, get guys on the same page and that’s pretty much it.”

It could also make it easier down the road for tech companies to obtain industrial loan charters or become full-service banks, which would allow these companies to gather deposits, cheap sources of funding. This would be bad for banks, which would face increased competition, and good for fintech companies that are already -- for the most part -- better at building technology than the banking industry.

Fighting misinformation has, frustratingly, been half the battle during this health crisis. Transparency is vital. Especially when it involves parents who are concerned about their children and educators who must worry 24/7 about their own health and families.
 Last month, we criticized the state over its failure to provide requested information about the state’s dealings with nursing homes, which have been at the deadly epicenter of the pandemic in Pennsylvania.
 Again, it’s a public safety issue.
 And again, state officials pointed to the 1955 law as their shield.
 Terry Mutchler, who was the founding director of Pennsylvania’s Office of Open Records, sees a flaw in that reasoning.
 “I think a lot of people read the statute, see the word confidential, and call it a day,” Mutchler told Spotlight PA last month. “But based on the actual language of the law itself, coupled with previous case law, there is substantial room for the department to err on the side of transparency.”
 That approach should apply to district-by-district data on COVID-19, too.
 The state is erring there, and it's not on the side of transparency.
 We should demand — in the name of school safety — more openness.
 Accurate and timely information is everything right now.
