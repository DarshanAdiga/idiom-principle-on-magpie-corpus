2005 was not a queer-friendly time, so for Ang Lee to go out on a limb and create a movie as remarkable and open as _Brokeback Mountain_ caused a stir in the fairly heterosexual nature of Hollywood. The LGBT representation in mainstream media was not as progressive as it is in this day and age. In a way, the love and critical acclaim gained by _Brokeback Mountain_ pushed the idea of mainstreaming queer culture into the green zone, since the film was not only approved by critics but also worked its magic on the box office, earning a whopping $178 million worldwide against its $14 million budget. The movie attained 71 awards and had an additional 52 nominations.

Las hermanas Andrés decidieron crear la campaña al oír un anuncio de Cáritas para recaudar fondos. De este modo, con la contribución del '@reto1euro' ellas, junto a todos los donantes, colaborarán en el objetivo solidario de la entidad.
 Marina Andrés ha explicado que la movilización ciudadana en las redes sociales para mostrar de una forma amena su solidaridad, como subir una foto de la propia niñez o vídeos con el rollo de papel higiénico, las empujó a "crear un reto de verdad con el verdadero significado de compartir". Para que sea un paso entre todos, las hermanas han animado a subir al Instagram una foto en ropa de casa, donar 1 euro e invitar a otros a que se sumen al reto.
 Las donaciones del @reto1euro pueden realizarse por los sistemas de pago como Paypal o Bizum y a través de la plataforma GoFundMe para cantidades a partir de 5 euros. Las hermanas aseguran que, aunque parezca un paso pequeño, "es importante creer en que con solo un poco, pero entre todos, se pueden hacer cosas muy grandes estos días".

Many struggling with mental illness are living on the streets and coming into close contact with people with substance abuse disorders and other conditions that put them at risk, he said.
