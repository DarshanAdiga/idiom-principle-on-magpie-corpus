BALTIMORE (AP) — The lawyer for the wife of Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas said she is being subjected to an “unfounded ongoing investigation" by Texas police after she allegedly pointed a loaded gun at her husband's head upon finding him in bed with another woman last month.

However, the growth of the market is likely to negatively impacted by the by limited capacity of power generation, high operating and maintenance cost, and rise in transmission and distribution expenditure. The players in the market are further likely to face challenges from the rise in captive power plants, improving energy storage systems, and strict government regulations. However, players can capitalize on the opportunities arising from electrification of remote and rural areas in developing countries and the introduction of inverter and bi-fuel generators.

That marked the state’s highest annual number of suicide deaths since 2009, the first year the office began providing data.


  Michael, of Spofford, and Devin initially wanted to raise $20,000 by August — through their GoFundMe page and community fundraisers — to donate to local suicide-prevention group The Samaritans of Keene, with some dollars used to help pay for their ride.


  But their Keene Family YMCA-sponsored fundraiser was canceled due to COVID-19, and other fundraising efforts have been put on the back burner, Deb said.


  "We pulled back on fundraising," she said. "We felt it wasn’t the time to ask businesses for money; it wasn’t appropriate."


  The campaign still has the same fundraising goal, Deb said, but the boys will be accepting donations until they leave in summer 2021. As of Wednesday, their GoFundMe page had raised just over $6,000, and Michael said the campaign has collected more than $15,000 total.


  Their new trip across the Granite State is expected to take 10 days and cover about 700 miles.


  From Keene, the boys will head up toward the Canadian border and then come down to the Kancamagus Highway in the White Mountains.


  They will then go to the Seacoast, where a 140-mile bike trail will bring them to Hampton Beach before they head back to the Monadnock Region.


  Throughout the trip, the boys will be leaving informational flyers and brochures about suicide awareness — provided by The Samaritans — at public places. Next year, assuming businesses and schools have reopened, they will stop at locations across the country to speak about the cause.


  Michael and Devin plan to reach out to other cyclists about whether they should wear masks or other personal protective equipment during this summer's ride, Deb noted.


  And though it's a much smaller journey than they'd envisioned, the pair is still preparing by riding their bikes daily, Deb said.


  Similar to their original plan, the boys will carry camping gear and food on their bikes to stay as self-sufficient as possible.


  Their parents will meet up with them each night to check in, and, in case of an emergency, will also be following their ride using a tracking device, Deb said.


  "We will use this extra year to train hard and raise as much awareness and money for suicide prevention as we can," Michael said in a text. "We are very [grateful] for the support we have been shown, and encourage everyone to get outside and enjoy the great outdoors."

"It was originally difficult to accept the fact of the matter, since we have put so much work in to prepare for the trip," Devin said in a text. "... we are excited that this means we [will] be able to contribute more to prevention in the long run."


  The idea for the ride — which they're calling Pedaling for Prevention — came from Michael, who lost his older brother, Nathan, to suicide two years ago.


  And as Michael's best friend and an avid cyclist, Devin, of West Chesterfield, wanted to be part of the cause.


  Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in New Hampshire, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports. A total of 276 suicides were recorded in 2018, 16 of them in Cheshire County, according to data from the N.H. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan was right to reopen the beach, Boardwalk and Inlet parking lot as a first step toward more liberties. It's time the reopening process enter the early stages as livelihoods depend on it.
 We feel the critical aspect of the COVID-19 crisis has shifted from health to economic. Lives are being forever damaged by the government shutdown of private enterprise. There was a time in mid-March when the health crisis merited mandatory business closures due to the unknowns of the mysterious virus. That time has come and gone. We now know the vulnerable among us must make difficult choices as to how they want to live in this time.
 For the majority, however, this is a matter of choice and personal responsibility. The financial stress and pressure has led many to believe the cure - crippling livelihoods through eight weeks of social isolation - has been indeed worse than the disease. Let's be clear here - the economic ramifications of the government's shutdown of the marketplace will be felt for many years. The efforts toward recovery will take months to bear fruit. This is going to be a slow rebound for commerce.
 This summer is not going to be challenging for Ocean City. It's going to be weeks before all businesses are open and maybe months until they can operate at capacity. For restaurants and bars, everything will be different, as new health and sanitary regulations will likely result in them spending more money while sales are limited in scope in some fashion. For retail stores, restrictions will be lifted first with the expectations of restraint and safety measures but the general populace's financial wherewithal is much in doubt. For real estate, the market was hot pre-COVID-19 and there's no reason to believe it cannot regain steam, but the big question is how much financial damage has been done to prospective buyers and how will lenders react in these uncertain times.

La temporada de la Bundesliga se reanudará el 16 de mayo en estadios sin público, retomándose la actividad con el mismo calendario que tenía hace dos meses al interrumpirse por la pandemia de coronavirus. El anuncio el jueves fue dado a conocer al día siguiente que los clubes recibieron la luz verde para reiniciar el fútbol tras una reunión de la canciller Angela Merkel y los gobernadores de los 16 estados federados del país. “La decisión significa la supervivencia económica para algunos clubes“, dijo el director ejecutivo de la liga alemana, Christian Seifert. El ejecutivo también advirtió que el virus no deja de ser un peligro. “Todo el mundo tiene que tenerlo claro. Estamos a prueba. Espero que todos estén a la altura de la responsabilidad. Nuestro plan es el detectar temprano los contagios“. Seifert señaló que la temporada se retomará con los partidos de la 26ta fecha, destacándose el derbi del Ruhr entre Borussia Dortmund y Schalke el sábado. Ese partido pondrá a prueba a las autoridades locales, que tratarán de evitar que grupos de aficionados se reúnan cerca del estadio o en bares para verlo por televisión. Seifert indicó que la vuelta del fútbol obedece al éxito de las autoridades gubernamentales y sanitarias en la respuesta al brote. Alemania ha registrado un elevado número de contagios del Covid-19 — casi 170,000 casos reportados al jueves, según la cuenta de la Universidad Johns Hopkins — con 7,000 decesos, una cifra menor en comparación con otros países. El relativo éxito del país en el combate del virus se atribuye a que pudo hacer muchas pruebas al inicio del brote, un robusto sistema de salud y estrictas medidas de confinamiento que recién ahora empiezan a relajarse. “Que se nos permita volver a jugar tiene que ver con la respuesta del liderazgo político de Alemania frente a la crisis, y el sistema de salud que tenemos en Alemania“, dijo Seifert. “Cuando me preguntan sobre la cantidad de pruebas en las teleconferencias con otras ligas profesionales, con las ligas de Estados Unidos, los clubes de la NFL, la NHL, las Grandes Ligas del béisbol y otros, yo les menciono cuántas pruebas se pueden hacer en Alemania, entonces ellos revisan, y hay silencio, porque la situación que tienen es inconcebible”. Apenas un tercio de la masiva capacidad de pruebas de Alemania, de casi 1 millón por semana, se está usando actualmente, dijo Lars Schaade, el subdirector del Instituto Robert Koch. Aunque la liga francesa fue cancelada, el regreso de la Bundesliga alienta la esperanza de los directivos del fútbol en España, Italia e Inglaterra de que quizás podrán completar sus temporadas. “Estoy confiado en que Alemania sea un gran ejemplo para que el fútbol — con todo su entusiasmo, emoción y espontaneidad — vuelva a nuestras vidas“, dijo el presidente de la UEFA Aleksander Ceferin. La Bundesliga fue suspendida el 13 de marzo, cuando le restaban nueve fechas por disputar. Seifert mencionó que la última fecha se jugará el fin de semana del 27 y 28 de junio. Añadió que la segunda división también comenzará el 16 de mayo. Sky, el servicio de televisión de paga, informó que algunos de los partidos de los dos primeros fines de semana, se emitirán gratuitamente en Alemania. Seifert, quien habló desde Francfort tras una videoconferencia con representantes de cada uno de los clubes, advirtió que todos los involucrados en la liga deberán mantener estrictas medidas de higiene para evitar otra suspensión. Seifert informó que se han detectados 10 casos positivos del Covid-19 en las primeras dos rondas de pruebas entre los 36 clubes profesionales, y dos positivo en la tercera ronda. Se contempló inicialmente que los equipos pasen dos semanas en cuarentena previo a la reanudación de los partidos, pero se alcanzó un compromiso de tener una pretemporada en aislamiento más corta por parte de cada equipo debido a que los jugadores se han sometido a varias pruebas. Seifert señaló que la decisión sobre el uso de cinco cambios por partido dependerá de un dictamen de la FIFA. La entidad rectora hizo la propuesta para que los jugadores puedan lidiar con el trajín de muchos partidos. Pero ello depende de la aprobación de la International Football Association Board, el organismo que regula las normas del fútbol mundial.

Although there are specific issues (such as contact tracing and reopening strategies) that clearly require some level of informal cross-jurisdictional coordination, most local and state governments will not have any capacity to engage in governance reform efforts until the situation stabilizes.
