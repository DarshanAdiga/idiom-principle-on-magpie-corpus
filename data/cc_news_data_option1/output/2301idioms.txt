Major League Soccer is resuming its season amid the coronavirus pandemic on July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament in Florida that won't include fans in the stands.
 The league's 26 teams will be divided into six groups for the opening round of the tournament at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex at Walt Disney World.
 Sixteen teams will advance to the knockout round, with the winner earning a spot in the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League. The group matches will count toward the regular season, the league said.
 Teams had played just two games to start the season when the league suspended play March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 While in Florida, players will be sequestered in a resort and be subject to a rigorous testing protocol. Each team will have three group matches, played over 16 consecutive days with multiple games a day. Games will be played in the morning and the evening to avoid the heat.
 Players will be tested for COVID-19 before they leave for Orlando and when they arrive, as well as during the competition. Staffs will also be tested.
 Commissioner Don Garber noted on a conference call with reporters Wednesday that it will be impossible to test everyone who might come in contact with players, like hotel staffs.
 "We do need to manage social distancing. We will have that in place. We will need to manage facemasks and other PPE. For anybody that is involved in this project, we will have sanitizing and other things like temperature checks and the like for those that are involved in hotels and involved in housekeeping and the like. But those are not our employees," Garber said. "We're confident, having gone through this protocol, both with our own infectious disease doctor but also in sharing that with the MLSPA's infectious disease adviser, and also with the state authorities."
 Garber could not say whether a certain number of positive tests would stop the tournament.
 Atlanta United goalkeeper Brad Guzan remained concerned, especially when it comes to hotel staffs. Florida continues to see rising COVID-19 cases.
 "That's certainly a question because there's obviously going to be a lot of hotel staff that are coming and going. The parks are going to be open. You know, somebody can easily be asymptomatic, not realize they have it, and ultimately be what some officials have described as being called the superspreader," Guzan said. "We don't know. And so, I guess we're all taking this leap of faith."
 He also noted that it was hurricane season in Florida and it was unclear whether there were contingency plans for the weather.
 The announcement of the tournament comes a week after the league and its players reached an agreement on a contract that runs through 2025, clearing the way for the event.
 The prize pool for the MLS Is Back Tournament is $1.1 million, the league said. The title match will be played Aug. 11.
 Sporting Kansas City coach Peter Vermes said the tournament was the best option for the league in the short term and players are looking forward to it.
 "The whole idea is we have to get ready for them, do the best we can to prepare ourselves, we have to win them," Vermes said "At the same time, it's not something we've dealt with before, we're going to be part of history in regards to this, so let's take advantage of it if we can."
 Following the tournament, teams will likely resume the season in their home markets. It was unclear whether those games would be played with fans in the stadiums.
 Teams can begin arriving in Florida for training on June 24. Those that have already been training must arrive no later than seven days before their first match.
 The draw was held on Thursday and as hosts, Orlando City will be the top seed in Group A.
 Nashville will move to the Eastern Conference for the tournament and the rest of the season.
 "I mean, obviously, it makes sense for us to be in the Eastern Conference for a variety of reasons. Other than the teams in Florida or Atlanta, we're the farthest southeast in MLS. So it just makes a lot of sense to do that," Nashville GM Mike Jacobs said. "The hope is whether it's rivalries that develop naturally because of proximity I think it's a good thing for us in general and time will tell where the league determines where we play in the future."

Track regulars continued to see red as Gypsum Racing speedster 'Lightning' Larry Wight dominated the Tuesday Night Special to score his first career Pepsi Big-Block Modified victory at Land Of Legends Raceway.
 Defending LOLR points champion Kevin Root avenged a weekend heartbreaker, notching his first win of the 2020 Canandaigua campaign in the companion Speed Connection Sportsman main to complete the first mid-week show of the season.
 Both drivers appeared to have the quickest cars on the track Saturday yet right-front flat tires proved costly when it counted most; Root dropping from first to third-place on the final lap while Wight vacated third and turned pitside with less than 10 laps to go en route to posting a disappointing DNF (did not finish) on opening night.
 "Nice to be able to rebound from Saturday, think we definitely had the fastest car here then and had a tire go down and take us out of contention," said Wight, 27. "Tonight we rebounded just like it was Saturday, track was phenomenal, a little bit of dust with the new surface but I'm sure Paul (Cole, promoter) will be able to figure out what he's got to do with it."
 Matching the total of 26 entries signed in for Saturday's Spectacular, top traveling stars Matt Sheppard, Stewart Friesen, Jimmy Phelps, Billy Dunn and Wight's Gyspum teammate Billy Decker joined the fray Tuesday, turning the event into a mini Super DIRTcar Series showdown. Return appearances by opening day race winner Pat Ward, Erick Rudolph, Tim Fuller and Pete Britten made it eight of the Top-15 point chasers from the 2019 SDS in competition.
 Starting 11th on the 26-car grid, Sheppard methodically worked his way to the front, on two occasions lifting his front end completely off the ground as he bounded low out of the second corner holding nothing back in tracking down the leaders. 'Super Matt' grabbed third from Britten on lap 21 yet needed 10 more circuits to slip under Friesen for the runner-up slot.
 With the final 15 laps run caution-free, Wight rolled on to open a dozen car- length advantage under the checkers followed by Sheppard, Friesen, Alan Johnson and Britten. Twelve of the 18 finishers completed all 40 laps.
 "With all that moisture up top in 3 & 4 you could run in there just about on the deck," said Wight, after running the extreme high side of the speedway the entire distance. "We were pretty much flat-footing it all the way around. So to shut it down and try it on the bottom, it just wasn't gonna work. Especially restarting on the middle of the back stretch like its done here."
 Oval track action opened Tuesday night with the Land Of Legends coming to life as Sportsman racers chased a $1,000 payday in 30 laps of feature racing.
 Saturday winner Matt Guererri started on the point yet a lap eight restart was all Root needed to dispose of his front-row partner and the Geneva pilot remained relentless the rest of the way to post his first win of the season in Ontario County.
 "Went to the top that one time and it stuck pretty good, and I didn't think we were any good at all up to that point," said Root, 41, who captured his first Canandaigua points crown last season with four wins to his credit. "(Matt) was running the bottom so I just had a good opportunity on that restart to go to the top and that's all she wrote."

 Advocates have details they can act on in campaigning for improvements in oversight, care and staffing. City and county officials have fresh insights into how to direct health department resources.
 Statewide, DHSS says 176 long-term care facilities have at least one COVID-19 case. Nationally, The New York Times reports, based on available data, more than a third of COVID-19 deaths have been linked to long-term care facilities.
 Yet Missouri officials will not give citizens the bare minimum of information that would let them know if the facility where a loved one lives has been affected.
 There is a better way, beginning with DHSS and reluctant local officials understanding that, as much as we all wish it were not true, the pandemic remains a serious concern — especially for those living in care facilities. There is still time to do the right thing.
 Citizens have reason to question whether state law in fact bars the naming of the nursing homes and providing other relevant data. Appointed and elected officials at every level should rise to the moment, revisit these questions and consider what more the government can do to provide details the public wants and needs.
 For starters, this should include a review of how officials have interpreted the language of the Sunshine Law calling for it to be “liberally construed” in the public’s interest.

“We’re by no means back to where we want to be, but we hope the future will be bright,” Brunell said.
 Not every boat on Winnipesaukee can get to the docks at the Wolfetrap, as they have to be able to fit beneath the Main Street bridge in order get to the restaurant on Wolfeboro’s Back Bay. But those that can pull it off will find a newly expanded patio, said Amy McDevitt, manager of the Wolfetrap Grill and Raw Bar.
 McDevitt said plans for enlarging their outdoor dining started last year, before “novel coronavirus” became a household term. The addition came at a fortuitous time, because now, she said, “We have as much capacity as if we had our inside seating.”
 The Wolfetrap has added the ability for patrons to call ahead for seating, which they never did before, and they can’t seat guests at the bar. Other than that, 2020 has been not much different for the business, McDevitt said.
 “For us, it’s not really different. Having the bar not open is difficult, but other than that it’s been pretty seamless,” said McDevitt.
 It’s been similarly similar at Liliuokalani's, a coffee and ice cream shop on Paugus Bay in Laconia. Frank Pasquarello, the owner, said they moved the tables on their deck apart, bought masks for employees and hired an extra helper to keep up with cleaning. Aside from those changes, it’s been a typical spring. Better than typical, in fact.
 “Business has been good, actually. I was surprised, I thought I would be quiet, but it’s been very good. May is usually a quiet month for us. (But) we opened up and it was pretty busy all along,” Pasquarello said.
 Liliuokalani's has a couple of docks for people coming from the lake, and a deck for people to enjoy the view while they work their spoons. Guests are welcome to bring their dogs, too, and Pasquarello said there’s even something on the menu for the furrier of the family members.
 At this time of year, it’s usually only busy on the weekends, he said, but that's not been the case this year.
 “We’ve been pretty busy during the week, we’ve been surprised,” Pasquarello said. “People are saying, hey, we’re up here, we might as well enjoy our boats.”

BUFFALO -- Josh Allen has hardly spent this coronavirus pandemic-altered offseason in self-isolation.
 The Buffalo Bills quarterback, instead, kept himself busy in seeking advice from Peyton Manning and Brett Favre on Zoom calls, to gathering his teammates together for workouts on both coasts.
 It's all been done with an intent to continue developing into a team leader entering his third season, and smooth the inconsistencies that have hampered Allen and the offense's production.
 What fuels Allen is the still stinging memory of his up-then-down performance in a 22-19 overtime loss to Houston in an AFC wild-card playoff, in which the Bills squandered a 16-0 third-quarter lead.
 "I was talking about it last night, so I'm definitely not over it," Allen during a Zoom conference call with Buffalo-area reporters Thursday.
 He was efficient in the first half by going 13 of 20 for 131 yards and catching a touchdown pass, before unraveling in going 11 of 26 for 133 yards and a lost fumble the rest of the way.
 "I know that we had opportunities to win that game," he said. "That's something that continues to drive me in knowing I could've played better and I could've done more, and I could've eliminated a mistake here or there that could've been super easy to eliminate and given us a better chance to win that game."
 It was a performance which encapsulated the best and worst of Allen, the Bills 2018 first-round pick, who has yet to shed his pre-draft reputation of being a strong-armed, but raw product with accuracy issues.
 "I've got personal goals set out for myself," Allen said, noting his 11-0 career record when completing 60% or more of passes in games he starts and finishes.
 "So I think that's the goal every game to at least hit 60%," he said. "I'm not going to try to force things and I'm not going to be Captain Checkdown either."
 The test for Allen this offseason has been finding ways to improve without the benefit of on-field practices, with the pandemic wiping out the NFL's entire spring schedule.
 He began by seeking advice from former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, whom he met at the Super Bowl. It continued with offensive coordinator Brian Daboll inviting Favre -- Allen's childhood idol -- and Manning to provide tips during the Bills' virtual quarterbacks meetings.
 Allen then took it upon himself to organize a workout with Bills offensive rookie draft picks in California in early May, followed by bringing together 19 offensive players for workouts in Miami a few weeks later.
 Allen's take-charge approach drew praise from Daboll and coach Sean McDermott.
 "He's our quarterback, but you can't force leadership. You can improve it, you can learn about it. You can grow from it," Daboll said. "But Josh has innate leadership qualities that guys gravitate toward, and he understands his role on the team."
 Added McDermott: "It's a critical step that he took it upon himself and his own initiative to put this together."
 The Miami workouts were particularly important because they marked the first time Allen was able practice throws with receiver Stefon Diggs, the dynamic threat acquired in a trade with Minnesota in March.
 "It was very, very awesome to see just the amount of detail he puts into his craft, how communicative he was, how willing he was to learn," Allen said of Diggs, noting they first got to know each other from afar by playing video games. "He's such an explosive player and a great player, and he's going to add a lot to our offense."
 Scoring more points was general manager Brandon Beane's objective behind acquiring Diggs, who joins a well-established group of receivers rounded out by John Brown and Cole Beasley. Despite a 10-6 finish, the Bills scored 21 or more points just six times and ranked 23rd in the NFL in scoring and 24th in yards offense.
 Allen made significant strides from his rookie season by showing poise and patience in the pocket, rather than sprinting off at the first sign of pressure. He did benefit from playing in front of a sturdier and rebuilt line, which featured four newcomers, including center Mitch Morse.
 Allen doubled his touchdowns passing total to 20 and threw only nine interceptions (down from 12 the previous year). Though he enjoyed a six-point jump in completing 58.8% of his passes, Allen still ranked last among NFL starters.
 Allen particularly credited Romo for providing tips that have improved his throwing motion, which he saw pay off during the Miami workouts.
 "I felt like it's the best I've ever thrown," Allen said, noting the next step is reproducing that motion once the Bills can begin practicing. "I feel good where I'm at right now."

Further, American cinema helped to spread the fictional “lost cause” narrative that has attempted to rewrite history while transforming the terrorism of slavery into something much less real, though much more palatable to certain white audiences. The idea of a “lost cause” originally emerged in the period after Reconstruction. An overt attempt to erase the savage brutality of slavery during the age of Jim Crow white supremacy, a revisionist history began to emerge which suggested that though the south had lost the civil war, the fight itself had been a noble cause that was predicated on an attempt to preserve a cherished way of life. That “way of life” might also be known as slavery.

Country in crisis seeks change and leadership
   
 Will 8 minutes, 46 seconds change our society?
   
 I don't know the answer to that. As someone who was in law enforcement for 30 years, I do know that the actions of those four officers charged in the death of George Floyd were totally out of line.
   
 In the midst of a pandemic, there have been protests all over the world. Most were peaceful and those who violated the law should be held accountable.
   
 In the midst of all of this, people are looking not only for answers and change, but leadership. This country has failed on that account.
   
 The president is busy "inspecting" the White House bunker and planning campaign rallies. I will give him credit, however; he did build a wall. Not on the border but around "The People's House."

 Local school district run by incompetents
   
 Why am I not surprised by the article June 5 telling us that some Sarasota County School District administrators released possible reopening plans without the participation of the School Board and, more importantly, the teachers union? In my 31 years as a public educator, I have never seen or experienced a school system run by such incompetent, teacher-hating folks.
   
 We had a number of requirements when we were shopping for a retirement location. One was that the schools must be good because that affects home and property values. We thought that Sarasota County's system was good -- for Florida.
   
 As I have learned, whatever credibility the district has is due to the teachers and support staff, and to the tenacity of their union. Since the retirement of highly able former superintendent Lori White, I have seen the decline of the system under the rule of a buffoon and a politically partisan state Board of Education.
   
 And now I know that this infected culture reaches deeply into that administration building on the Tamiami Trail.

 Change law enforcement, don't eliminate it
   
 In your June 10 edition, the writer of "Black communities will suffer without police" mistakenly assumes that "defunding" the police means eliminating them all together.
   
 Rather, most of those who are calling for defunding are suggesting that police officers are too often called upon to resolve issues for which they are neither trained nor qualified, and that some, but not all, police funding should be diverted to hiring additional professionals whose specialties are conflict resolution, mental health and social work.
   
 This would relieve a great burden from existing police departments, and leave them to do what they do best -- protect and serve.
   
 The letter further cites Chicago shooting statistics, which only go to prove that what we are doing now is not working.
   
 Finally, the writer's reference to George Soros, Holocaust survivor and billionaire philanthropist, is an old and tiresome anti-Semitic, right-wing meme that really needs to be put to rest.

 Remember good police save lives every day
   
 The death of George Floyd was a tragedy and protests calling for change are justified.
   
 But most people do not know what a policeman sees and does every day. They save lives every day regardless of skin color, deliver babies, rescue drug addicts and run toward danger when we run away.
   
 There are bad cops, just like there are bad people, everywhere. We should remember that good policemen and policewomen are necessary to maintain order in our communities.
   
 I have a grandson who is a good cop and I am proud of him and pray for his safety.

Em um dos arranjos experimentais, o pesquisador pegava bebês resos que já haviam criado laços com suas mães e os colocava em uma câmara vertical de aço inoxidável – um “poço do desespero”. E lá eles ficavam por meses e meses, às vezes, um ano inteiro. “Durante a sentença prescrita nesse aparato, o macaco não tem contato com nenhum animal, humano ou sub-humano”, escreveu Harlow, num artigo publicado em 1965 descrevendo os resultados.

One can see the resonance of the ahistorical propaganda of films like The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind in the current popularity of a more contemporary version of the lost cause narrative as represented by 2011’s The Help, a film that became the most watched title on Netflix as the recent backdrop of street protests dominated the news. Viola Davis, who received a best actress nomination for her role in The Help, stated in 2018 that she regretted doing the film, while Bryce Dallas Howard, who appears as the cartoonish racist villain in The Help, responded to the film’s renewed popularity by describing it as “a fictional story told through the perspective of a white character” which was “created by predominantly white storytellers”. While The Help is not Gone With the Wind, it is another in a long line of more recent films where the trope of the white savior is celebrated, while the black characters on screen are used as racial props so as to bolster themes of benevolence, generosity and overall white goodness.

Gone With the Wind is a descendant of DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation from 1915, the foundation that American cinema is built upon, a film that screened at the White House, prompting President Woodrow Wilson to declare it “history written in lightning”. It was celebrated for its technological mastery of visual storytelling, yet its narrative is nothing more than racist propaganda. The heroes of the film are the Ku Klux Klan who ride in at the appropriate climactic moment to save the day. The Birth of a Nation is at the root, so if racism is at the root, the fruit that emerges from this tainted root can only be the fruit of racism.

Blues singer Lady A has challenged the stars of Lady Antebellum to rethink their name change, because she's not about to give up her moniker.
 Anita White, who has been performing as Lady A for two decades, was stunned to learn the country trio had dropped 'Antebellum' from their name due to racial sensitivities this week and intended to perform and record as Lady A.
 Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood explained the 'Antebellum' name had too many links to the American Civil War.
 A statement read: "We are regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word referring to the period of history before the Civil War, which includes slavery."
 The other Lady A is not a fan of the name change and in an interview with Rolling Stone, the 64 year old reveals she's upset that the country trio didn't reach out to her at all.
 "This is my life. Lady A is my brand, I've used it for over 20 years, and I'm proud of what I've done," she tells the publication.
 "This is too much right now. They're using the name because of a Black Lives Matter incident that, for them, is just a moment in time. If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before. It shouldn't have taken George Floyd to die for them to realise that their name had a slave reference to it."
 "It's an opportunity for them to pretend they're not racist or pretend this means something to them," she adds. "If it did, they would've done some research. And I'm not happy about that."
 Lady A is planning to take legal action to protect her business trademark for Lady A LLC.
 "I'm not about to stop using my name," Lady A says. "I'm not going to lay down and let this happen to me. But now the burden of proof is on me to prove that my name is in fact mine, and I don't even know how much I'll have to spend to keep it."
 Representatives for the country trio insist the stars were unaware of White, but were planning to contact her.

Long before Viola Davis’s Oscar nomination in The Help, though, Hattie McDaniel would be the first black actor in Hollywood to be nominated and win in 1940 for her role as the dutiful servant Mammy in Gone With the Wind. McDaniel was not allowed to attend the film’s 1939 premiere in Atlanta because of her race. And though she would make history at the 1940 Oscars ceremony at the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles she was forced to sit in a segregated “colored section” separate from the white actors in an area created specifically for her during the evening’s event. McDaniel’s role in the film was such a fundamentally stereotypical representation of white society’s desired way to see black women that her character’s name, Mammy, came to be descriptive of that particularly pervasive stereotype. The sassy, cantankerous, asexual Mammy was a caricature of black womanhood and McDaniel was made to endure the implications of this caricature in the racist treatment she received on and off screen.

NEW YORK -- Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred says there is a "100%" chance of big league ball this year.
 Major League Baseball will make another proposal to start the pandemic-delayed season in empty ballparks, but Manfred vowed Wednesday to unilaterally order opening day if an agreement is not reached.
 "I can tell you unequivocally we are going to play Major League Baseball this year," he said.
 Manfred insisted the chance of playing this year was "100%."
 The players' association made its second proposal Tuesday, asking for an 89-game regular season and 100% of prorated salaries. MLB's plan a day earlier was for a 76-game season, would guarantee 50% of prorated salaries and hinge 25% in additional money on the postseason's completion.
 "It will be a another significant move in the players' direction in terms of the salary issue that has kept us apart," Manfred said during an interview with ESPN before that network's coverage of the amateur draft.
 "We're hopeful that it will produce reciprocal movement from the players' association, that we'll see a number other than 100% on salary and some recognition that 89 games, given where we are in the calendar in the course of the pandemic is not realistic," he said.
 MLB has threatened a shorter schedule if players insist on 100% of their prorated salaries. The union likely would file a grievance, contending a longer schedule was economically feasible and asking arbitrator Mark Irvings to award damages.
 There has not been a big league schedule of fewer than 80 games since 1879. Both MLB and the union have proposed expanding the playoffs from 10 teams to as many as 16 this year and next, but that enlarged postseason is contingent on a deal.
 "I would prefer to negotiate a new agreement with the MLBPA that gets us more games and resolves the issues that have separated us amicably," Manfred said. "But at the end of the day, we negotiated for the right in March to start the season on a number of games that we select in these particular circumstances. And if we have to, we'll exercise that right."
 A March 26 agreement called for prorated salaries in exchange for $170 million in salary advances and a guarantee of service time even if no games were played.
 Manfred wouldn't divulge when he would order a shorter schedule. MLB initially proposed 82 games and the union responded with 114. While players want to extend the postseason deep into November, teams fear a second wave of the coronavirus would jeopardize the postseason. The playoffs alone generate $787 million in broadcast revenue -- before selling any games caused by an expansion.
 "Each and every day that goes by, we lose the capacity to play at least one game, and that's really the time pressure that's significant at this point in time," Manfred said.
 The players' association declined to comment on Manfred's remarks.
 MLB claims each additional regular-season game in empty ballparks causes a $640,000 loss because 40% of revenue is tied to gate. The union has disputed MLB's figures but claims it has not been given the data it needs to make a full evaluation.
 "Some owners have mentioned that owning a team isn't very NET profitable.. You know what other company isn't very NET profitable? Amazon," tweeted Washington pitcher Max Scherzer, a member of the union's eight-player executive subcommittee.
 Manfred told MLB Network the sides were "very, very close" to agreement on health protocols.

That said, these older images from Hollywood’s past do represent an actual history. And this is a history that should not be suppressed. Yes, America’s business is “all out in the street”, as they say, currently exposed for the world to see. There is value in people seeing just how overtly racist Hollywood was at one time so as to understand what that means both then and now. Attempting to erase the past is never a good thing. On the other hand, hiding behind weak arguments about how the film can be enjoyed without indulging the racism of its time is especially disingenuous. Films like Gone With the Wind – and to be clear there are decades of racist films maybe not as popular but which have also contributed to America’s especially problematic depiction of black people – need not be banned, but these images do not need to be elevated either. To watch Gone With the Wind without this knowledge is to miss the necessary context that is needed to properly understand the film’s reprehensible role in furthering racism far beyond 1940. To add important information about the racial legacy of this and other films is a step in the right direction.
