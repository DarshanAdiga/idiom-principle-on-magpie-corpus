Last but not least, children's clothing retailer The Children's Place rounds out the list of risky stocks to watch. Shares have lost nearly 60% this year as the pandemic forced temporary store closures and virtual learning struck at the back-to-school season. At the same time, prudent cost reductions -- the company aims to close 300 stores by the end of fiscal 2021 (The Children's Place currently has 920 locations) -- alongside a huge boost in digital sales (up 118% last quarter) offer some light at the end of the tunnel. Although 2020 will doubtlessly be an awful year, analysts expect PLCE to return to convincing profitability in 2021. If the pandemic continues to hold back the economy for longer than is currently expected, PLCE will continue to struggle. But the stock trades for just 12 times forward earnings, offering compelling potential if the pandemic's impact wanes as expected in 2021.

General public tickets for 2020 PBR World Finals went on sale Oct. 5.
 Also leaving Las Vegas this year for Texas, the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, is moving to Arlington’s Globe Life Field, the home baseball park of the major league Texas Rangers team. Set for Dec. 3-12, organizers with the PRCA confirmed the event will comply with all health and safety protocols for attendees. Tickets are on sale.
 “We are committed to delivering a spectacular event for our fans and we are thrilled to be in Texas for it,” PRCA CEO George Taylor said in a statement.
 Safety measures will include a mask requirement at all times while inside Globe Life Field. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will be available throughout the building.
 The National Finals Rodeo started at the Dallas State Fairgrounds in Texas in 1959. Years later, it moved to Las Vegas and held at the Thomas & Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas since 1985. That venue is not available for live entertainment with fans this year due to coronavirus restrictions in Nevada.
 Globe Life Field is encouraging all guests to check the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services websites for any guideline changes prior to the event.
 Meanwhile, the WRCA organizers say they are thrilled to be able to still hold the World Championship Ranch Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas Nov. 12-15, especially since it’s the 25th anniversary. As of Sept. 17, the popular rodeo is “still on” with working ranch competitions, cowboy musicians, a historic cowboy documentary of the WRCA, and a trade show featuring handmade cowboy gear, tack, furniture and art.
 “2020 has been a challenging year to say the least with all sorts of events having to cancel or postpone. We worked closely with the city of Amarillo,” WRCA manager Leman Wall said. “This virus thing was kind of new and spiking at a higher level, but we’re into a time of year now that people got a handle on it, and we were able to move forward.”
 This year’s rodeo will still be a four-day event, but there will be six performances making it a “three-go-round” rodeo. The venue will stagger visitors throughout the different rows and sections at the Amarillo Civic Center complex. Masks are encouraged. All local and state recommended guidelines will be followed.
 Ranches will compete in five events including: ranch bronc riding, stray gathering, team penning, branding and wild cow milking.
 Panhandle Tickets will be in touch with current ticket buyers to re-ticket them into 50% capacity, then remaining seats for any performances will be opened for purchase. Tickets were expected be back on sale by Oct. 15.

The Tritown meetings of officials from Bolton, Lancaster and Stow and the Nashoba School District tend to be sparsely attended events.
 Wednesday night likely broke attendance records as over 60 residents came out, virtually, to fill the cyber room, Oct. 14, primarily to discuss the schools, including hybrid versus remote learning at the high school and concerns about communication.
 The almost three-hour meeting can be watched on Stow's YouTube channel.
 "The chat is saved and is a public record and will be posted on Stow and Bolton sites," Stow Selectman Megan Birch-McMichael said.
 Birch-McMichael chaired the meeting.
 The Tritown discussion offered an opportunity to discuss the issues, district decision making and plans going forward, a process many in the chat stated they were not getting from the School Committee meetings.
 "It's important people felt they had their issues heard or starting to be heard," Birch-McMichael said at the end of the meeting.
 In the interim, the discussion got animated, with school officials taking criticism over the communication, what some felt were inadequate plans for moving forward with hybrid education at the high school and even questions about it seeking town COVID funds.
 "Most people are just expressing frustration at not understanding what's going on or what the school district is doing," Bolton Selectmen Chairman Bob Czekanski said. "I've been listening for an hour and have no concise idea what's going on."
 He added, addressing the schools, "your biggest problem isn't the air conditioning; it's the mounting frustration that the School Committee in particular has to figure out how to address. It's like the dam is going to burst and you have to let the steam out of the steam kettle before it blows up," mixing some metaphors in an already jumbled discussion.
 Addressing discussion of why there was not yet a hybrid return at the high school, School Committee member Stephen Rubinstein said, with four weeks of school so far, "we would love to have full in-person learning, but there are certain proscriptions and caveats that we really are doing to keep your kids safe."
 "I would love to get people back before Christmas," Superintendent of Schools Brooke Clenchy said. "Nothing can replicate good solid teaching in a classroom. I feel the remote model is as close as it can get."
 But she held out a potential path to in-person schooling.
 "If parents suggest they are willing to forego the 6-foot distance and go to a 3-to-6 foot," which state education officials have said is a safe distance, Clenchy said, "we have some hybrid models in our back pocket ready to go. If that's where parents really want to go, we'll do that."
 She said probably 30 percent want to remain fully remote. "Parents want choice; we fully hear that."
 Lancaster Selectman Jason Allison, who took the better part of an hour asking questions of the administration, clarified that Clenchy was saying that if the next survey finds parents are willing to give up something, such as distancing, high schoolers could get back to the building.
 Communication is lacking, Bolton Selectman Stan Wysocki said. He noted a public records request that elicited a response from the district's law firm. It was not a difficult question, yet the district spent money to have an attorney respond, he said.
 "My impression from listening tonight is that the school district doesn't know what to do with input it gets unless it is in the form of a survey, very structured, at a time of the school district's choosing," Czekanski said. "And that's not going to foster good relationships in the community."
 Taking criticism, School Committee Chairman Kathy Codianne said she heard what was being said.
 "I agree about communication and it's a two-way street. If this has been an ongoing concern, why haven't you reached out to any of us?" Codianne asked.
 That prompted a burst of chat activity about emails that were not responded to.
 Birch-McMichael finally tempered the discussion. "I feel like tempers are getting really high now" and becoming unproductive and personal.

One of the first prominent high-flying SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, is Virgin Galactic, the first publicly traded commercial space company. It has virtually no sales -- SPCE had $4 million in revenue in 2019, yet is valued by the market at nearly $5 billion. The company is unprofitable and is expected to remain in the red in 2021. That said, many analysts think space tourism will be a lucrative industry at some point in the 2020s. An average target price of $25.75 for SPCE represents 25% upside from current levels. Virgin Galactic is ahead of the pack in its industry, but what makes it a risky stock to watch is its valuation, uncertain margins in the years ahead and a number of potential competitors, including SpaceX and Boeing (BA), among others.

Small biotech stocks are the primary residence of binary events. Oftentimes a company with no revenue will have a few drugs in development, with all the stock's value tied to the approval and commercial success of those drugs. That's a good description of Lipocine, which is worth around $100 million based purely on its pipeline potential (trailing revenue is immaterial at less than $170,000). LPCN's leading candidate is Tlando, an oral testosterone replacement therapy. Having already gone through years of clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to rule on the drug's approval within the coming weeks, and some analysts believe Tlando could bring peak revenue of $50 million annually.

The latest update for Brexit developments is not so positive for GBP, but there could still be light at the end of the tunnel. Reuters reports that Britain said on Monday there was still no basis for trade talks with the European Union to resume, following a call between British and EU negotiators David Frost and Michel Barnier. ''The UK continues to believe there is no basis to resume talks unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU," a statement from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said. "This means an EU approach consistent with trying to find an agreement between sovereign equals and with acceptance that movement needs to come from the EU side as well as the UK." However, the spokesman did describethe call as constructive and said that both sides had agreed to remain in close touch. "The UK has noted the EU's proposal to genuinely intensify talks, which is what would be expected at this stage in a negotiation," the statement said. GBP/USD remains in positive territory to start the week despite the hold-ups in talks. GBP/USDis trading at 1.2983, a touch below the highs of 1.3024, up 0.53% for the day and trades up from a low of 1.2889.

 Simply put, Newcastle were not brave enough on the ball. According to Wyscout’s data, they managed only one ‘smart pass’, which is categorised as a “creative and penetrative pass that attempts to break the opposition's defensive lines to gain a significant advantage in attack.”

GEORGIA – A local teacher was recently announced as a runner-up for this year’s Vermont Teacher of the Year award.          According to a news release from Vermont’s Agency of Education, Lauralee Wilson, a math coach at the Georgia Elementary and Middle School, was a “distinguished finalist” in the running for the Vermont Teacher of the Year award.          According to Vermont’s education agency, the annual teaching award celebrates “an outstanding teacher who represents the thousands of excellent educators in our state, demonstrating leadership to peers by defining quality and rigor and support by sharing collaborative professional knowledge.”          For this current school year, Colchester High School’s Susan Rosato was ultimately heralded as Vermont’s Teacher of the Year in an announcement that celebrated the Colchester teacher, who helped expand her school’s English Learner program, as a “passionate advocate for equity in education.”          Reached by email for comments late last week, Georgia’s elementary school principal Steve Emery responded by sharing quotes from the letter of recommendation he wrote for Wilson’s nomination.          According to Emery, Wilson “presents a culture that supports a sense of belonging for all.”          “It is the relationships she constructs that is the foundational practice of her work,” he said, adding that Wilson “creates student learning opportunities that enhance and promote engagement, fun and meaningful work, thus resulting in students deeply explaining their understanding and learning.”          According to the Agency of Education, Elizabeth Nolan, a music teacher at the Edmunds Elementary School in Burlington, was selected as the formal “runner up” to the Vermont Teacher of the Year award.          Joining Georgia’s Wilson as a “distinguished finalist” for the award was Rebecca Ebel, a special education teacher at the Vergennes Union High School.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers miss Christian McCaffrey, particularly in the red zone.
 While Mike Davis has been a solid fill-in for McCaffrey and helped the team to three wins, the reality is if the Panthers want to make a run at the NFC South championship they'll need their dynamic running back on the field — and soon.
 McCaffrey has missed the last four games with a high ankle sprain and should be nearing the end of his recovery period. It is generally considered a four- to-six week injury, although coach Matt Rhule wouldn’t say if the 2019 All-Pro running back will play Sunday at New Orleans.
 Carolina is 28th in the league in the red-zone offense, converting 47.8% of its trips into touchdowns. To put that number in perspective, the Seahawks lead the NFL in red-zone offense, scoring touchdowns 88.9% of the time.
 The Panthers were 1 of 3 in the red zone in a 23-16 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.
 “You’re not going to win games if you don’t punch drives in the red zone in for touchdowns and they’re always field goals,” Panthers coach Matt Rhule said.
