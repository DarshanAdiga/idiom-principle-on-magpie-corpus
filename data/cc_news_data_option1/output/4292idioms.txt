The role of a contractor is heavily discounted by customers as it is the name of the developer that attracts a prospective home buyer. Yet it is a role that is critical in the eventual finishing of the project. Contractors like L&amp;amp;T, Capacite, Shapoorji, Arabian Construction Company, etc are good names to have on board. The downside is that an incompetent or a fraudulent developer can make a fine contractor underperform.

In contrast, Cathy Rentzenbrink's Dear Reader: The Comfort and Joy of Books is as personal as it gets. It starts with her unpacking her books after moving to Cornwall, making piles of the most treasured ones, and reading through them in the reassuring knowledge that there are many more to come. In unpretentious and winsome prose, she then takes us on an odyssey through the milestones of her life, each one foregrounded by the books that accompanied her.

Parker's hosted their eighth annual Fueling the Community Charity Golf Tournament at The Westin Savannah Harbor Golf & Resort on Oct. 20.
   
 'Tis the season for car shows, farmers markets and golf tournaments! It is truly a hardship to drive up to the Westin's lush golf course, grab a cart with my favorite female Kentuckian Arra Riggs and cruise around smiling at over 144 avid golfers and Parker's supporters.
   
 Walking past me holding his walkie talkie is one of the reasons I love crossing the big bridge. Let me introduce you to Rheubin Lewis. For the past 15 years I have looked for this consummate professional and am more than delighted to share my love of this cool cat with new Westin General Manager Stuart Robinson. Hearing a little of his north England accent, I attempt a mini interview but get distracted when energizer bunny Brandon Hofmann zooms by.
            
 Parker's COO is the first and only person to flex a Superman pose with Rheubin and Orlando, Florida, native Austin Swanger. After trying to get Heather Davis to join the pic, I follow Brandon over to welcome Southern Eagle's golf team. Holding onto the possibility that a few Budweiser's may have been consumed by Sean Hogan, Frank Forsberg, Mark Drierzbinski and Carl Lesher, I giggle when the guys point to Frank as their best player and the one who drank the most.
   
 Pausing Stafford Media Group's Jillian Stafford with her director of operations and Buy Local President Courtney Rawlins, I tell her that I will miss their last Buy Local luncheon of the year but am positive that media maven Mia Mance will rock it. Before the ladies can leave to gather more content for Parker's social media marketing, I hear the man of the hour calling my name.
   
 Looking all kinds of suave, tan and fit, I pose Greg Parker between Jillian and Courtney and then get a chance to quiz him on Parker's winning the Convenience Store Decisions Chain of the Year and on his ever growing empire. "My goal is to be able to reach and influence everyone. Education and health care are the two things that make a difference in everyone's life." With a record donation to Georgia Southern's College of Business and endowment to Memorial Health University Medical Center's emergency room, I can say that we all feel the impact of Greg's commitment.
   
 After telling me that he is an avid tennis player, isn't a micro-manager and has plans to meet up with one of his besties, Susan Mason, for her 80th birthday at the The Olde Pink House, I get a clearer understanding of why Parker's has become the standard in convenience stores. It's not the business but the people.
   
 Greg tells me, "You see Brandon. He is the heart and soul of this company. He is a math genius, the life of the party, can be found dancing everywhere and has been with me since he was 19 and was working the night shift at my Hinesville store." Hearing the love and the pride he has for this zany guy gives me a glimpse into why this company is booming.
   
 Hating to drive away from this riveting conversation, Arra and I head back out onto the course and meet Steve Yawn, a dude that drives 18 hours from Temple, Texas, to play golf today and three uber tall Halo models, Lane Knight, Caroline McCoy and Bethany Cox, who pose with good-looking Aaron Brenner. Totally fine having a mini posing session with the ladies, Aaron happily shares, "This is my favorite part of the day!"
   
 When I say it's a perfect day for golf, picture clear skies, a slight breeze and a team of rascals from Coca-Cola. Missing Pete Gagne, but happy to see Mike Licausi teasing Arra about anything he can, I snap a pic of the guys before heading over to meet a trio of Parker's men Josh Cohen, Jeff Bush and Keith Harvin.
   
 After teasing Jeff for being a little GQ while posing Arra with the obvious good friends, I head inside and find Sterling Seacrest Partners David Paddison chatting with Hancock Askew's Mike McCarthy, Ryan Sewell snacking on some BBQ and Richard Papy ready to pose with my new 6-foot tall Halo model friends.
   
 It's raffle and award time! After everything from beach cruisers and ear buds to grill, coolers and a 55-inch TV given away, Brandon announces Imperial Dade as the tournament winner. I get chance to thank their public relations genius Allison Hersh for the invite out to see Greg and his team and to thank them for leaving a footprint of change in every aspect of our community.
   
 During these events, when people are wearing face masks, I suggest they remove the mask, I quickly take the photo, and they put the face mask back on.

The Jammu and Kashmir BJP on Friday demanded the arrest of PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti for her seditious remarks wherein she said she would only hold the national tricolour when the flag of the erstwhile state is restored. The BJP said no power on earth can either hoist the state flag again or restore Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing reporters for the first time since her release from 14-month detention following the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year, Mehbooba said she will only hold the national tricolour after the flag of Jammu and Kashmir is restored. In an act seen as defiance, the flag of the erstwhile state was prominently placed on a table in front of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president along with that of her party during the presser. I request Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to take cognisance of seditious remarks of Mehbooba Mufti, book her for the seditious act and put her behind bars, Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina told reporters. We will sacrifice every drop of our blood for our flag, country and motherland. J-K is an integral part of our country, so only one flag can be hoisted in J-K and that is the national flag, he said. Raina said the party will not tolerate such nefarious designs aimed at instigating the people of Kashmir. I warn leaders like Mehbooba Mufti not to instigate the people of Kashmir. We will not allow anyone to disturb peace, normalcy and brotherhood. In case anything wrong happens, she will have to face the consequences, he said. If Kashmiri leaders are feeling insecure in India, they can go to Pakistan and China, he added. During her presser, Mehbooba accused the BJP of looting the dignity of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. We had acceded to a liberal, democratic, secular India. Let me tell them we are not comfortable, we are incompatible with today's India where minorities and Dalits are not safe and where they tried to disrespect us by looting our dignity, she said. Referring to the Centre's move to abrogate Article 370 on August 5 last year, Raina said no decision taken by the government can be reversed. He said Article 370 gave rise to separatism, terrorism and was instrumental in killings of thousands of people. As the government has permanently scrapped Article 370, no power on earth can restore it. No power on earth can hoist any flag other than the national flag in J-K, he said.

“I took the stories, and wrote it for what works in front of the camera,” Scearcy said.
 Rather than use re-creations or b-roll footage, Scearcy positioned his actors to tell the stories as eyewitness accounts. Most of the stories came from people living in the Midwest, including many from Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
 Scearcy likes to joke that ghosts seem to be drawn to small-town America.
 “Small town people move a little slower, so I think they notice things more,” Scearcy said. “In my research, I learned that ghosts seem to have preferred zip codes. ... They like small town USA.”
 Ultimately, Scearcy said, “13 Midnights” is produced in such a way that the viewer’s mind creates the images — more than any reenactment could do — which last longer and cause the viewer to think about the story the next day.
 Filmed throughout the Kansas City-metro area, Scearcy looked for places which gave a hint of history and lent themselves to setting the mood for the stories.
 He hopes viewers find themselves experiencing the same adrenaline rush of the original experience, saying, “A good story moves you and encourages you.”
 More ‘Midnights’ to come
 Scearcy and his wife Melissa (Patchin), a Joplin native, have three adult children. Their youngest son, Zac, assisted his father on this show.
 Scearcy is already at work on season two of “13 Midnights.” He hopes it will be finished in time for a fall 2021 debut.
 “I love writing it and love working with the actors,” Scearcy said. “Standing behind the camera, watching the actors perform, I found my mouth opening and thinking, ‘Oh my gosh.’”
 While there are no blood and guts in the stories, Scearcy said people should consider it as carrying a PG rating because of the intense storytelling.
 ‘Midnights’
 The 13 stories include:
 • “The Hunt” — A tourist’s fun ghost hunt becomes terrifying when they follow her home.
 • “Who’s There?” — A bartender is stalked by a creepy reflection that leers at her through the mirror.
 • “Friends” — A man fears an unfamiliar presence that appears in his best pal’s eyes.
 • “Words” — A mysterious stranger awakes him every night to deliver an ominous threat.
 • “There’s Good and Bad” — A grandmother defends a child conned by a sinister imaginary friend.
 • “Piano Man” — His piano lessons become a command performance that endlessly haunts his life.
 • “Under The Bed” — A young mother protects her daughter from the monster that lived under her own bed.
 • “Time” — A salesman is startled when Time answers the door and invites him into the past.
 • “Workout” — A 20-something struggles with her identity when she is taunted by the impossible.
 • “4 Walls” — A college co-ed locks herself away to stop psychic visions of a ghastly future.
 • “Houses” — A real estate agent is fearful when past property owners make themselves known.
 • “The Protector” — A brawl with a poltergeist leaves a boyfriend branded by the supernatural.
 • “Night Light” — A veteran battles a ghostly attacker that is more frightening to him than war.

Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Ben Ray Luján and Republican opponent Mark Ronchetti traded barbs during another local TV debate in Albuquerque on Wednesday night, including Luján’s record in Congress and President Donald Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
 In an hourlong debate hosted by KOAT-TV and the _Albuquerque Journal_ , the two candidates jabbed each other at length and debated key issues such as the future of health care, climate change, and New Mexico’s high rate of violent crime and substance abuse.
 Ronchetti criticized Luján for not accomplishing more during his time serving as one of the top-ranking U.S. House representatives and slammed the congressman for supporting universal medical coverage and environmental policies the former TV meteorologist argues have hurt timber communities in New Mexico.
 Luján fired back that Trump, whom Ronchetti supports, has devastated the country by failing to offer a comprehensive, unifying federal plan to fight the coronavirus pandemic and failed to warn the public about the severity of the coming health crisis even when the president knew of its danger in January, according to a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.
 Either Luján, Ronchetti or Libertarian Bob Walsh will succeed Tom Udall, who is retiring from the Senate.
 “I’m not a politician and I have zero interest [in] the political fights that are now destroying Washington,” Ronchetti said Wednesday. “Our leaders now fail to hear the people they swore to represent, and sadly my opponent has climbed the ladder in D.C. and left New Mexico behind with nothing to show for it. Mr. Luján is the assistant speaker of the House. It’s a fancy title, but at the end of the day, it hasn’t meant anything for New Mexico.”
 Luján said he has worked on numerous pieces of legislation that saw bipartisan support and have helped New Mexico residents, such as the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief aid to the state and the rest of the nation.
 “This is serious,” the congressman said. “COVID-19 has already taken 225,000 lives across America. [And Trump] continues to shame people who wear masks, even after he was diagnosed with COVID.”
 During the debate, Luján stressed his New Mexico roots and longstanding love of the Land of Enchantment.
 Responding to criticism from Ronchetti, Luján argued that he has sponsored and co-sponsored numerous bills that the U.S. House has passed — including another coronavirus aid package with direct relief for small businesses such as restaurants struggling during the pandemic — that have not yet been taken up by the U.S. Senate.
 Luján argued that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stalled or killed much of the legislation House Democrats have tried to pass to help lower the cost of medical premiums, prescription drug prices and offer further pandemic relief to families and businesses struggling during a time of intense economic turmoil.
 Ronchetti responded that Luján and fellow Democrats included measures in the COVID-19 relief bill that they knew Republicans would never support and said they did it to score political points.
 “This is about D.C. politics,” Ronchetti said. “This is about not wanting to give a political victory to your opponent. When you’re asked about it, all you do is fire at the other side. We need real leadership and not excuses. The fact is, you’re in the middle of this. You’re the one that can help.”
 In a debate Sunday night, Ronchetti and Luján fought over the future of the U.S. health care system and the impact of potentially repealing the Affordable Care Act, as many Republicans want.
 The congressman said repealing the ACA would devastate New Mexico — a state with more than half of its residents on Medicare or Medicaid and a steady uptick in Medicaid applicants after many lost their jobs amid the economic crisis spurred by the coronavirus.
 The two candidates returned to that topic Wednesday, with Luján arguing that the Medicaid expansion and protections for people with preexisting conditions guaranteed by the ACA has been a boon for New Mexico residents.
 Ronchetti said he supports the ACA “until we can replace it with something better.”
 Luján, of Nambé, is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives. He’s considered by some to be the favorite in the race, with years in Congress and widespread name recognition throughout Northern New Mexico. Recent polls have shown him with a 9 percentage point lead over Ronchetti.
 But Ronchetti has raised an impressive profile for himself during the course of the campaign. The two have released numerous, expensive television ads during a campaign that has been largely online and televised.
 The two candidates have ramped up attacks in recent weeks and made numerous accusations of irresponsibility and ineffectiveness against each another.

Enbridge noted that it’s in good condition but has proposed running a new section of pipe through a $500 million tunnel that would be drilled beneath the straits.
 The public service commission has a say over the company’s plan because it would need to approve relocating Line 5.
 Enbridge argued that the commission’s scope was limited to the pipeline itself, not the proposed tunnel, which would be overseen by the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority, established in 2018.
 But in his ruling, Mack concluded that the pipeline and tunnel were “inextricably connected.”
 While the commission would not decide whether to approve the tunnel, it would question whether the pipeline relocation would serve a public need, is designed and routed reasonably, and would “satisfy applicable safety and engineering standards,” he noted.
 Mack agreed with Enbridge that the commission shouldn’t consider whether the entire 645-mile (1,038-kilometer) pipeline needs to continue operating, as environmental groups and tribes wanted.
 It’s appropriate for the commission to consider whether the pipeline relocation would comply with the Michigan Environmental Policy Act, relying on state and federal agency experts, Mack said.
 But he said there was no legal basis for making global warming caused by fossil fuels transported through the pipeline a factor in the commission’s decision. Environmentalists said they would appeal that part of his ruling.
 “There is no getting around the fact that building a new oil tunnel to operate for up to 99 years would exacerbate climate change,” said Kate Madigan of the Michigan Climate Action Network.

Yet now, more than two years since the United States officially shifted strategic priorities away from terrorism to focus on great power competition, there is a continued sense of uncertainty as to what exactly this means for counterterrorism. In light of the enduring, and in some cases escalating, terrorist threats across the globe, it is important to get this right.

BROCKTON -- In a place called The City of Champions, a housewife named Rae Zuckerman became a champion for the disabled, creating a comfortable gathering place for people who were otherwise shut-ins, confined to their homes every day with not much else to do.
 Zuckerman, now 85, established Living Independently for Equality Inc. in 1983 after being inspired by a story she read in The Enterprise, about the plight of a young man who became isolated and lonely as a disabled person, after suffering a paralyzing injury as a result of a car crash.
 While currently shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, the organization continues to operate three days per week at its L.I.F.E. Center in the community room of Hamilton Wade Apartments at 54 Haverhill St., where members socialize, play games, get a free breakfast and lunch and receive assistance obtaining medical services, public benefits, legal aid and housing.
 "She read that article and she said, 'There's got to be other people like this stuck in the house,'" said Bobby Zuckerman, her son. "So she wanted to make a place where they can go and mingle and have something to do. The thing is, there's no one disabled in my family. She was a stay-at-home housewife who raised two boys. It was really out of the blue that she did this after reading a story in the Brockton Enterprise. She said, 'How do I help this kid and other people?' She founded a nonprofit. She learned to write grants."

 The Brockton City Council recently approved a proposal to dedicate Brookfield Drive as Zuckerman Way, giving the road an alternative name and installing a street sign bearing the name of Rae Zuckerman, recognizing her for establishing Living Independently for Equality, which continues to serve disabled adults and provides them a sense of community.
 Members get transportation to the program through the Dial-a-BAT service offered by the Brockton Area Transit Authority. In addition to offering a place to hang out, Living Independently for Equality hosts guest speakers and brings members on outings to restaurants, bowling alleys, bingo games, museums and the circus.
 Bobby Zuckerman said a dedication ceremony is being planned for Oct. 29 at 2:30 p.m. at the intersection of Brookfield Drive and Elsie Road. A red street sign with white lettering was purchased by the city and will soon be installed under the green sign for Brookfield Drive, which is where the Zuckerman family lives.
 Speaking by phone, the 85-year-old said she was honored by the street dedication.
 Rae Zuckerman is retired from her longtime role as executive director running the day-to-day operations of Living Independently for Equality, which has a team of volunteers and has been managed for the past five years by Cindy DiScipio. Those volunteers have included Rae Zuckerman's husband, Bernie Zuckerman, who has done the weekly food shopping for the organization since it opened 37 years ago.
 "During all these years, we've helped a lot of people," Rae Zuckerman said. "It was wonderful helping them. It has been worthwhile. It was wonderful."
 This isn't the first time Rae Zuckerman has been recognized for her efforts to help the disabled. Back in the early '90s, the Brockton woman was honored in the nationwide Maxwell House Coffee Real Hero's Contest, featured in People Magazine for her work and flown to Washington where she and the other contest winners met first lady Barbara Bush.
 "She said to Barbara Bush, 'It's such an honor to meet you,'" said Bobby Zuckerman, recalling the oft repeated story. "Barbara bush looked at my mother and said, 'No, honey, it's an honor to meet you.' That stuck with my mom a long time. It really meant a lot to her. And it's nice that she's being recognized again by the city for all she's done for disabled Brocktonians. It's a well-deserved recognition, and we're all very excited."
 In 1997, Rae Zuckerman was named the first Champion of the City, an award that was once announced each year by The Enterprise, honoring city residents for their contributions to the community. Zuckerman got the inaugural award along with Arthur Paquin, who also coincidentally has a street named after him in the city.
 The L.I.F.E. Center was originally located at the meeting room of the National Guard Armory on Montauk Road.
 Bobby Zuckerman said that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, causing policy changes for federal properties, the L.I.F.E. Center was forced to relocate. Former state Sen. Thomas Kennedy, D-Brockton, who himself was a wheelchair user, was an early supporter of the organization and was "instrumental" in helping the group find a new home, Bobby Zuckerman said.
 "He was very involved helping my mother establish the center originally," Bobby Zuckerman said. "He was very gung-ho about it."
 Ward 1 Councilor Timothy Cruise, cousin of Kennedy, who died in 2015 while in office, confirmed the connection he formed with Rae Zuckerman before voting to support the street dedication.
 "He loved your mother," said Cruise, addressing Bobby Zuckerman at a recent city council meeting.
 Ward 6 Councilor Jack Lally said he went door-to-door to 30 homes in the Brookfield Drive neighborhood and people were supportive of the honorary street sign.
 "These people were all for it," Lally said to Bobby Zuckerman. "They have some very kind things to say. I think it's a testimony to our neighborhood. They all knew your mother. I think Mrs. Zuckerman is a pretty good case as someone who has done a lot for the city of Brockton and its residents and deserves such recognition from the city."
 Bobby Zuckerman said the center remains the only one of its kind throughout the state.
 "I can't tell you how many lives she's touched," he said. "It's countless. Our whole family is unbelievably proud of my mother's accomplishments. For somebody who never was affected by such a disability to have such a drive to help others with such problems is amazing. We're just glad that her legacy is going to live on."

ROSWELL, N.M. (AP) — A former Alamogordo police officer has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a 2019 wreck in Roswell in which one person was killed and two others were injured. Luke Maxwell Towner faces a Dec. 14 hearing after pleading guilty Thursday in state District Court to one count each of homicide by vehicle, aggravated driving while under the influence and great bodily harm, the Roswell Daily Record reported. Judge James Hudson said an agreement between Towner and prosecutors recommends a 15-year sentence, including 12 years in prison and three years suspended and served on supervised probation. Court documents indicate Towner the night of Dec. 5 was driving his pickup at 70 mph (112 kph) in a 35-mph zone when he rear-ended a vehicle stopped at a traffic light. Doug Annis, 26, of Roswell, was in the other vehicle's backseat and was fatally injured. That vehicle's driver and a second passenger were injured. Towner was an Alamogordo police officer from 2013 to 2016.

Halloween, more than almost any other holiday, is about fun. It's like New Year's, but with corn syrup instead of booze.      It began with the Gaelic festival Samhain, which celebrated the end of harvest while ushering in the dark half of the year, a spooky time when the boundaries between the living and spirit worlds were thought to become more porous. Brought to America by Irish and Scottish settlers, Halloween found footholds in the southern colonies, and developed a more playful, mischievous, and decidedly corny vibe.      Candy corn didn't start out as a Halloween treat but jumped on the bandwagon in the 1950s, as Halloween pivoted into a full embrace of processed sugar.      Corn officially became spooky with the release of "Children of the Corn," a 1984 movie about a Midwestern village where the kids took over and decided nobody was permitted to age beyond 17. In 1993, the world's first for-profit corn maze was built in Annville, Pennsylvania. Since then the tradition has taken off, and corn mazes now number in the thousands.      When I lived in New Mexico I learned about chicos, a type of Native American dried corn. "Chicos" means "little boys" in Spanish, as the kernels shrink when dried. The ones for sale at the store were dried to the hardness of popcorn, but when I make them at home I let them stay a bit chewy, like real- life versions of candy corn. Each batch of chicos has a unique character, with different levels of brown, crunchiness, chewiness and/or sweetness, depending on the corn and how long it's roasted.      Many Halloween corn mazes are closed this year, thanks to COVID-19. And door- to-door candy-begging is largely out, too. If treat-seekers are left to their own devices I'm fine with that, because processed sugar is poison, and a tradition that hinges on giving candy to kids isn't worth rescuing.      So allow me to tell you how I make chicos. I made about three dozen ears' worth, which won't last too long but is a nice stash. I will follow my chicos tips with a few recipes, one sweet and one savory, for how I used them.      Chicos   The only ingredient is corn, preferably with the husk on. Traditionally, the process involves a clay oven or "horno," but other ovens work, too. Ultimately, you're doing little more than drying out corn.      Although usually made with fresh corn, I've also made chicos with frozen corn, and the operation was surprisingly successful, even if the product lacked the soulful smokey flavor that a roasted corn husk imparts.      Turn the oven to 300 F and place the ears directly on the oven racks, not touching one another, and bake until the husks start to dry out and brown and even smoke a little, about three hours. When cool, peel off the husks. If using husked or frozen corn, skip this step.      Turn oven down to 225. Put the cobs on the oven racks, spaced so as not to touch one another, and bake until the kernels start to shrink and visibly dry out, about four hours. Let the ears cool completely, and rub off the kernels -- use the edge of a spoon if they are stubborn. Store in a plastic bag in a cool, dry place. The drier you get them, the longer they will store.      If making chicos from frozen corn, spread the kernels on a cookie sheet and bake at 225. They will take less time -- about two hours -- and will quickly turn brown and then black.      Chicos and Milk   Fill a bowl with chicos and milk, with sugar to taste. When the chicos are gone and you sip the sweet milk that remains, you may feel a distinct deja vu to a time, long ago, when you sipped the sweet leftover milk from a bowl of corn flakes or Frosted Flakes.      Beans with Chicos   A handful of chicos turns a pot of beans into something interesting and delightful. Served alongside rice, you've got a delicious meal with complete protein.   Serves 2   • 1 strip bacon (optional, recommended), chopped   • 1 tablespoon olive oil if skipping the bacon or if it's lean   • ½ cup minced onions   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or thyme   • ¼ cup chicos   • 1 can plain beans (pinto, white, black, kidney) including the liquid   • 1 can water or stock   • 1 teaspoon paprika or chile powder to taste   • Salt, if the bacon doesn't add enough   Fry the bacon on medium heat. When half-crispy, about five minutes, add the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry until the onions become translucent. Add the chicos, beans, water and paprika, and stir together. Season with salt, if necessary. Heat to a simmer, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking. Adjust seasoning and serve.

This suggests that looking ahead, the mutual relevance of counterterrorism and strategic competition is likely to increase. In some ways, the overlap between the two only deepens the strategic conundrum. However, this is not an argument to simply continue business as usual. The resources needed to shore up conventional warfare capabilities and deterrence needed for great power competition will not materialize out of thin air. Counterterrorism must indeed be de-prioritized, as mandated by the National Security and National Defense strategies. Nevertheless, rather than treat counterterrorism and great power competition as binary, either-or alternatives, it makes sense to acknowledge that counterterrorism is one of the many tools that are available to advance American influence as part of an overarching competitive strategy. Simply put, it is a form of currency.

Each story is based upon firsthand interviews with people; many of whom had vivid experiences with the paranormal.
 “The way it changed these people, they were no longer the same,” Scearcy said. “For one veteran, the experience was 40-plus years ago, but it was still vivid. His body still reacts to dark places because of what happened to him.”
 How it all began
 A graduate of Webb City High School, Scearcy attended then-Missouri Southern State College, planning to pursue a career in political science.
 By all accounts, Scearcy’s career trajectory was on track to meet the goal when a paper he wrote designing a marketing strategy for a political candidate landed on the desk of Sherman W. Tribbitt, then a gubernatorial candidate in Delaware.
 Straight from the classroom, Scearcy found himself embedded in politics on a high level. While his candidate won the election, Scearcy joked the experience taught him “very quickly” he did not want to pursue a political career or become a lawyer.
 So he fell back on his high school writing days under the direction of then- Webb City teacher Gene Schmidt, as well as his collegiate experiences in the Barn Theatre at MSSC working with Duane Hunt and Milton Brietzke.
 “(Schmidt) was very inspirational,” Scearcy said. “He inspired the idea that it was OK to be creative and what I wrote down had value. I learned through his passion.”
 Theater experiences, Scearcy said, “made my soul happy.”
 “Theater was a way I channeled my energy,” Scearcy said. “I learned a lot from Britzke and Hunt. What they taught me carried over into my political science degree because it taught me to speak with confidence when getting up in front of people. It was always such a joy doing theater.”
 So he traveled to Kansas City to obtain a master’s degree in theater. He now calls Kansas City, Missouri, home.
 A writer by nature, Scearcy began crafting scripts. His credits include two national playwright awards, organizing his own theater company — that performed at college campuses and military bases — and developing and running a dinner theater. He’s even spent time writing creatively for ad agencies.
 Ultimately, though, storytelling emerged as a passion. It helped him write and produce a family Christmas movie called the “Spirit of the Season” with Ernest Borgnine as well as comedy specials with comedian Marty Allen. Other credits include a series of sports-related films featuring legends Mohammad Ali and Hank Aaron, as well as two humorous books.
 “A lot of people look at a blank piece of paper and say, ‘Oh my gosh,’” Scearcy said. “I say, ‘Whoopie! Which way do I go?’”
 Developing ‘13 Midnights’
 Scearcy said he fell in love with scary stories while spending time with his grandmother. He remembers sitting down with her to watch the “Twilight Zone” with bottled Coca-Cola and popcorn. After the show, his grandmother would regale him with a variety of scary family tales.
 It was the same love for spine-tingling tales, that led Scearcy to the “13 Midnights” project.
 While in rural Grove, Oklahoma, researching another project, Scearcy found himself sitting at a table listening to a group of highly educated people talk about their experiences with the unknown.
 “To hear them tell what happened, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up,” Scearcy said, describing how a 30-minute road trip for a meal became something entirely different.
 He said the four were driving on back roads to get to a restaurant, when something appeared alongside the car and ran in front of the car.
 When they got to the restaurant, the four began to write down — without talking — what they saw, creating identical descriptions and pictures.
 As they began processing the information, the waitress came to the table asking them to order because the kitchen was about to close. Looking at the clock, the four realized more than four hours, which could not be accounted for had come and gone since they left for lunch.
 “It set me on a quest for the paranormal experiences,” Scearcy said, adding he put out the word — he was interested in stories.
 Initially, Scearcy thought the project lent itself to a written book. Then, as he sat listening to people, he realized the vocal storytelling aspect — especially through the timbre of the person’s voice and how they held their body — was vital to the tales.
 So Scearcy began to find and write 13 short stories, which each became a piece of the anthology now known as “13 Midnights.”

Con excelente pitcheo del derecho Walker Buehler y jonrones de Justin Turner y Austin Barnes, los Dodgers de Los Angeles vencieron 6x2 este viernes a los Rays de Tampa Bay, poniéndose en ventaja de 2-1 en la Serie Mundial de béisbol.


  Buehler (1-0) dio un recital de pitcheo con seis entradas completas, en las que esparció apenas tres imparables con una solitaria carrera y la friolera de 10 ponches propinados.


  El estelar lanzador, con apenas 26 años, ya ha hecho 11 aperturas en la postemporada. Pese a que ha estado lidiando con ampollas que le han impedido utilizar su recta cortada, ha estado super efectivo en cinco aperturas esta postemporada.


  En tanto, Turner, con el bate caliente, despachó vuelacerca en el primer inning y doblete, mientras que Barnes también se fue del parque en el sexto para sellar el marcador.


  La historia dice que un Juego 3 puede cambiar el rumbo de la serie considerablemente. El ganador del Juego 3 en una serie al mejor de siete empatada 1-1 ha salido airoso al final de las hostilidades en 65 de 94 ocasiones, para un 69.1%.


  El cuarto juego será este sábado en la misma sede del Globe Life Field de Arlington, con el mexicano Julio Urías en la lomita por los Dodgers, mientras que los Rays abrirán con el bullpen.


  \- Agresivos Dodgers -


  El recio toletero Turner salió agresivo en el mismo primer inning al conectar jonrón por al jardín izquierdo con dos outs al abridor Charlie Morton (0-1) -finalmente el derrotado-, quien también soportó sencillo al cuadro a Max Muncy pero después abanicó al receptor Will Smith.


  Para Turner fue su undécimo batazo de cuatro esquinas en postemporadas.


  En el tercero, a pesar de la buena colocación en sus lanzamientos Morton, permitió dos carreras más en ese capítulo por un desbol a Corey Seager, doblete de Turner y sencillo remolcador de Muncy al central.


  En el cuarto, los Dodgers continuaron descifrando los lanzamientos de Morton y con sencillo de Cody Bellinger, sacrificio con anotación de Barnes y sencillo remolcador de Betts, el conjunto de Los Angeles aumentó a cinco su marcador (5-0).


  Morton ponchó abriendo el quinto a Turner, pero otorgó boleto a Muncy y fue sustituido por el relevista John Curtiss, quien dominó a Smith en elevado y a Bellinger con ponche.


  El veterano Morton ahora tiene marca de 5-1 por los Rays en playoffs, incluyendo récord de 3-1 este año.


  Luego de cuatro innings en blanco, Buehler se equivocó en el quinto y permtió el primer hit a los Rays por dobletes consecutivos de los dominicanos Manuel Margot y Willy Adames, para aceptar también la primera carrera del conjunto floridano.


  Los Dodgers respondieron otra vez en el sexto por jonrón de Barnes contra el relevista Curtiss para aumentar la pizarra de 6x1.


  En el noveno, el MVP de la Serie de Campeonato de la Liga Americana, el cubano Randy Arozarena, despachó bambinazo ante el cerrador Kenley Jansen, su octavo de la postemporada y su hit número 23, records para novatos en las los playoffs.

 “Basically, what we did with data analysis is that we compared and contrasted (the catering business) before COVID-19 and after (businesses reopened),” Rao said. “We looked at volume of orders, and we wanted to see which clients were staying strong even through COVID-19 so that we could market based around them … and maybe see which ones were not doing well, so we weren’t focusing on places where we weren’t getting any profit.”
 He added, “After doing that, we kind of saw that the clients that we were having the best luck with were medical clients, because, obviously, they have to be in person to deal with the situation. They have to work more hours than they usually do, so they don’t have time to eat, so a lot of time they get a lot catering done directly to the hospital.”
 LocalData.ai, which was not compensated for its assistance, Kersala said, created a plan for medical clients, so food could be delivered when the clients had time to eat. It also promoted deals for clients who bought a certain level of food, Rao said.
 Besides City Kitchen, Kersala said, LocalData.ai has assisted some school- level clubs, and is now looking to consult with more businesses, particularly Black-owned establishments, in order to help them increase sales.
 “Recently, in light of the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other victims of police brutality, our team has started a unique project to raise money and awareness of systemic racism in our country. We plan to refocus our efforts to aid Black-owned businesses with their marketing. Our next steps are to create other computer science-related projects to support the cause,” according to a release from the trio. “In the works right now is a blockchain technology that leverages idle, crowdsourced processing power to mine cryptocurrency, which is exchanged for money that can be donated to various relief efforts to help Black-owned businesses and other charities, allowing individuals who may not be in a position to donate money directly still give a monetary contribution. Another is the creation of a web-based service that provides geographical information on the location of various black-owned businesses and protest locations.”

MIDLOTHIAN — Call it bad luck. Call it an off night. Maybe it was a little bit of pre-Halloween madness. Whatever you want to label it, the Pirates just didn’t have any luck Friday night.
 Though the Pirates dominated the stat sheet, Midlothian Heritage used friendly bounces and breaks to defeat No. 3 La Vega, 31-21.
 The loss pushed the Pirates out of first place in District 5-4A and into a tie with Stephenville for second place, though La Vega holds the tiebreaker with the Yellow Jackets. The Pirates travel to Alvarado for their final district game.
 La Vega controlled much of the first half, with its first points coming after back-to-back turnovers early in the first quarter.

The 116th Congress has already shown, on an ad hoc basis, how longer questioning periods can contribute to more coherent and decorous hearing exchanges. During the recent Senate hearings to consider a Supreme Court nomination, for example, each Senator was given a 30-minute period to question the nominee. The resulting respectful exchanges would have been difficult under a five-minute rule. On the House side, during the Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings, the majority and minority were each given a 45-minute block of time at the beginning of each session to question the witnesses. The longer periods enabled committee leadership to ask a series of questions to clarify the testimony provided and follow through on the points they wanted to make. The longer periods also made it easier to establish facts, explore important details, and prevent witnesses from engaging in evasive tactics. While the impeachment proceedings were marred by other problems, the longer questioning periods appear to have elicited better information and fewer uncomfortable moments than would have been possible using five-minute segments.

Updates with U.S. reaching one-day record for infections)
 By Maria Caspani and Dan Whitcomb
 NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - More than 84,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19 across the United States on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, a record one-day increase in infections during the pandemic as the virus surges again nationwide.
 The spike to 84,218 cases, breaking the record of 77,299 set on July 16, comes as University of Washington researchers forecast that the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 could reach a total of 500,000 by February.
 Sixteen U.S. states also hit one-day records for new infections of the virus that causes COVID-19 on Friday, including five considered key in the Nov. 3 presidential election: Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
 Health experts have not pinpointed the reason for the rise but have cited such factors as colder temperatures driving people inside, fatigue with COVID-19 precautions and students returning to schools and colleges.
 The latest estimate by the widely cited University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also reflects fears that cold winter weather will drive Americans indoors, where the virus is more likely to spread.
 "We are heading into a very substantial fall/winter surge," said IHME director Chris Murray, who co-led the research.
 The number of possible deaths could drop by 130,000 if 95% of Americans would cover their faces, the IHME said, echoing a recommendation by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
 VACCINES ON THE HORIZON
 "The good news on the horizon is that vaccines look promising," Fauci told CNN in an interview. "And hopefully by the time we get to the end of November, the beginning of December we will have shown that we have at least one or two - and maybe more but at least two - vaccines that are safe and effective."
 Health Secretary Alex Azar attributed the increase in cases nationwide to the behavior of individuals, saying household gatherings have become a "major vector of disease spread."
 Asked about an assertion by President Donald Trump during Thursday night's presidential debate that the United States is "rounding the turn" on the pandemic, Azar told CNN that Trump was trying to provide hope to Americans waiting for a vaccine.
 On Thursday there were 916 reported fatalities in the United States, a day after the country recorded over 1,200 new deaths for the first time since August.
 Eighteen states have reported their highest daily numbers of hospitalized COVID-19 patients since the pandemic started and on Friday, the number of COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals climbed to a two-month high.
 There are now more than 41,000 hospitalized patients with coronavirus across the country, up 34% from Oct. 1, according to a Reuters analysis.
 North Dakota, with 887 new cases on both Thursday and Friday, remains the hardest-hit state, based on new cases per capita, followed by South Dakota, Montana and Wisconsin, according to a Reuters tally.
 In Tennessee, hospitals in Nashville said they have experienced a 40% increase in patients admitted for COVID-19.
 Dr. Jeff Pothof, an emergency medicine physician at University of Wisconsin Health in Madison, expressed worry about a lack of compliance with public health measures in the state, where some groups have challenged Democratic Governor Tony Evers' COVID-19 restrictions in court.
 Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a curfew on nonessential businesses from 10 p.m. on Friday. She warned residents to avoid social gatherings of more than six people and end all gatherings by 10 p.m.
 Nearly 2,500 people were hospitalized in Illinois, the state's top public health official, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, told a news conference.
 The Northeast remains the one region of the county without a significant surge in cases, but infections are trending higher. Boston public schools shifted to online-only learning this week.
