WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of deep disruption, America is poised for a presidential election that renders a verdict on the nation's role in the world and the direction of its economy, on its willingness to contain an escalating pandemic and its ability to confront systemic racial inequity.
 But the two men on the ballot, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, offer more than just differing solutions for the country's most pressing problems. The choice before voters is a referendum on the role of the presidency itself and a test of the sturdiness of democracy, with the president challenging the legitimacy of the outcome even before Election Day and law enforcement agencies braced for the possibility of civil unrest.
 "There's more than just your standard ideological difference between the two candidates. There's a fundamentally different view of what the presidency is and what leadership means for the nation," said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.
 Voters appear to recognize the moment: More than 86 million people have already cast ballots, shattering records for early voting.
 A Trump victory would deepen the anti-establishment, inward-facing approach to the nation's challenges that he has ushered in over the past four years -- an approach enthusiastically embraced by the president's supporters and loathed by his critics. The courts, which have been stacked with a generation of conservative jurists during Trump's tenure, would veer further to the right.
 Victory for Biden would be as much a repudiation of the incumbent as it would be a win for the longtime Democratic politician, a former vice president and senator. Though Biden has outlined an agenda that envisions a more robust role for the federal government in American life and a more aggressive effort to combat the pandemic, the core of his campaign centered on him being a temperamental contrast to Trump.
 Control of the Senate is also at stake. Competitive races from Maine to Arizona give Democrats a chance to retake the majority from Republicans. Democrats are expected to easily maintain their grip on the House.
 The election is being held at a moment of bitter partisanship in America, and whichever candidate wins the White House will confront the challenge of governing through deep divisions. If anything, the campaign has clarified how stratified the U.S. has become, with Trump's base of support coming from overwhelmingly white voters at lower income and education levels. More highly educated Americans, particularly women, and voters of color, most notably African Americans, have all but abandoned the Republican Party during Trump's four years in office.
 Trump faced a particularly fierce outcry from Black Americans after his response to the largely peaceful protests that erupted across the country this summer over racial injustice in policing. The president highlighted the sporadic outbursts of violence and argued that white, suburban neighborhoods would be overrun by mayhem if Biden were elected.
 Biden has condemned Trump as racist. Biden also has made explicit appeals to Republicans, seeking to draw support from those who may have taken a chance on Trump but have been turned off by his divisiveness and fierce personal attacks on his critics.
 The Democratic nominee has proved to be an alluring alternative to some of those voters, given his more moderate record and campaign agenda, and his more traditional approach to foreign policy, including U.S engagement in the kinds of multilateral institutions such as NATO that Trump has flirted with abandoning.
 Dan Giesen, 56, of Minneapolis, said he was a conservative voter before Trump became the Republican nominee four years ago, leading him to vote for third- party candidate Evan McMullin. Last week, Giesen was waiting in line to cast his vote early for Biden.
 "I think we can deal with partisan differences when our institutions and our norms are in place, but I think that those are being seriously eroded under Donald Trump," he said.
 Biden heads into Tuesday's election with an edge in public polling, including a comfortable national lead and a narrower advantage in some of the battleground states that will decide the contest. He has multiple paths to victory and has devoted significant resources to the Upper Midwest states where Trump surprised Democrats four years ago, but also to states such as Arizona and Georgia that for years have been reliable Republican territory.
 Though Democrats are wary of overconfidence, given Trump's upset in 2016, party leaders see significant differences in this year's election. Biden is viewed more favorably by voters than Hillary Clinton was four years ago. And the pandemic, which has upended nearly every aspect of American life, saddled Trump with overwhelmingly negative reviews from voters on his handling of the crisis.
 "In the last 10 days of 2016, the story was, 'What's the FBI going to do about the newly reopened Hillary Clinton email investigation?'" said Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who was Clinton's running mate in 2016. Now, Kaine said, "they're talking about COVID and how it's affecting communities."
 The pandemic indeed turned Trump's plans for this election year inside out.
 The president opened 2020 in strong position, with a robust economic record and the GOP unified behind him after he survived an impeachment trial centered on his request for Ukraine's help digging up dirt on Biden.
 Since then, the coronavirus has gripped the nation, causing nearly 230,000 deaths and infecting more than 9 million Americans; both are the highest confirmed counts in the world. The U.S. economy cratered, and though it has recovered somewhat, the unemployment rate rests at 7.9% and businesses across the country are worried about surviving the winter, given that infection rates are on the rise.
 Trump himself contracted the virus in October and was briefly hospitalized. Since then, he's been barnstorming the country, holding large rallies with crowds that are not socially distanced and only sporadically wearing masks. His message to Americans has been that the U.S. is "rounding the corner" on the virus, despite the fact that cases are on the rise in most states and the U.S. is setting daily records for confirmed cases.
 Sixty-five percent of Americans said the president has not taking the pandemic seriously enough, according to a mid-October poll from The Associated Press- NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
 Despite the pandemic's toll on his political fortunes, Trump's campaign is banking on strategy similar to 2016. Advisers contend that Trump will draw out new voters who haven't participated in politics previously or in some time. His campaign is also banking on some voters ultimately looking beyond their personal qualms with the president to back his policies.
 That was the case for Tom Redford, 79, who cast his ballot for Trump on Thursday outside of Richmond, Virginia. Redford said he's the only Trump supporter in his family and doesn't much like the president personally.
 "But everything he's done is great -- everything, including what he's done on the coronavirus," Redford said as he waited in a line of more than 200 people.
 The president's pathway to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House is narrow. He needs to hold onto Florida, a perennial battleground, as well as nearly all of the territory he carried in 2016. He's spent the final days of the campaign on defense, making stops in states such as Georgia and Iowa, where he won comfortably four years ago.
 The challenge for Trump is engineering a late shift in the race when so many voters have already cast ballots. By Saturday, the early vote tally represented more than 60% of all the votes cast in the 2016 race.
 Associated Press writers Mohamed Ibrahim in Minneapolis and Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.

Millions of Americans have already cast their ballots ahead of Election Day, smashing mail-in and early voting records and raising election officials' hopes that the eye-popping early vote totals will ease the potential for problems, chaos and conflict at the polls on November 3.
 States have set records for early voting totals, many approaching and in some cases even surpassing the total number of votes cast in the 2016 election.
 Since voting began in September, there have certainly been issues at the polls, including hours-long waits, allegations of voter intimidation and suppression -- as well as incidents like one in North Carolina on Saturday, where police used pepper spray to break up a march to a polling place. But by and large, the worst fears of widespread problems or violence disrupting early voting did not materialize in what's arguably the most contentious election in recent memory.

LEXINGTON, Ky. -- UGA football put up its fewest points in a game against Kentucky in 25 years yet coach Kirby Smart didn't bite when asked if he felt his team is limited offensively.
   
 "I do not," he said after Saturday's 14-3 victory. "And I hope one day we get to show it. I hope we get an opportunity to. Because we get to go against a pretty good defense every day. I see them. I see them pass pro. I see them throw and catch the ball. I see them run. I see us play-action. I see good things out of our offense."
   
 Maybe it shows up in Jacksonville on Saturday -- it may need to-- because No. 9 Florida's style isn't a ball control offense like Kentucky's.
   
 Georgia's defense kept an SEC opponent out of the end zone for the second time this season and the fifth time in 14 conference games since the start of last season.
   
 Florida has a possible first-round NFL draft pick in quarterback Kyle Trask while first-year Georgia starter Stetson Bennett keeps having games that leave some fans wondering why the Bulldogs don't give someone else a chance.
   
 "I thought the guys came out here and played really hard and played really physical. I just have to fix the things I messed up on," Bennett said.
   
 Georgia's defense lost four starters Saturday to injury and a fifth, safety Richard LeCounte, was involved in a vehicle incident after returning to Athens after the game.
   
 Trask threw for 345 yards and four touchdowns Saturday night in a 41-17 win over Missouri.
   
 Smart continued to give every indication that Bennett will remain the starter. That seemed obvious given he stuck with Bennett after two more interceptions Saturday to give him five in the last two games, matching the number Jake Fromm had all of last season in 14 games.
   
 "There was no discussion about it," Smart said. "A batted ball on a pass that he's got to get around a guy is not a real struggle. I know you could say, 'if it happens once, shame on me. If it happens twice, shame on you,' but it's one of those things where he's got to wrap the ball around it, he's got to throw it away, he's got to get another opportunity."
   
 Bennett's two worst games in pass efficiency have come in the last two. Smart isn't judging Bennett on metrics like that but instead on things such as his second rushing touchdown of the season Saturday.
   
 "He also did a lot of good things in the run game," Smart said. "He pulled a ball and scored with it. He put us in the right run plays. He handled motion. He handled clock. He did some good things. He didn't get a chance to throw the ball an awful lot (Saturday) because we were able to run the ball."
   
 Smart and offensive coordinator Todd Monken haven't turned again to redshirt freshman D'Wan Mathis, the starter against Arkansas, or Southern Cal transfer JT Daniels, who has yet to play this season after a torn ACL last year.
   
 Making a quarterback change for Florida blew up on Georgia in 2015 and contributed to Smart ending up as Bulldogs head coach. The SEC Network broadcast crew said repeatedly Saturday that the impression they got after talking to Smart and Monken is that this is Bennett's team.
   
 Smart credited Bennett for his management of the offense -- handling shifts, motions and checks on a day Bennett said there were a lot of checks into run plays -- and Smart said Bennett really had just one "poor decision" when he didn't check down instead of throwing a pass he tried to toss out of bounds but didn't get it far enough.
   
 "I'm not going to overreact to one poor decision," Smart said. "It would be making those multiple times that gets concerning. At the end of the day we've got to play the guy that gives us the best chance to win."
   
 Georgia rushed for 215 yards Saturday, but even in a game where Zamir White had a career-best 136 rushing yards, the longest run of the day for the Bulldogs was his 22-yard touchdown.
   
 The Bulldogs have just one run of 30 or more yards this season.
   
 "We all know that in order to be the kind of team we want to be, the explosive team, we have to be able to run the ball for longer-yardage runs and we also have to be able to throw the ball effectively," Smart said. "We unfortunately didn't get much of a chance to do that today. Monken threw a couple of shots and he made a couple of plays with them."
   
 Smart wants more like the 46-yard pass play to James Cook and 33-yard catch by Darnell Washington.
   
 The Bulldogs 6.1 yards per play were still a season high. But the problem was the 57 plays run were the fewest for Georgia since -- you guessed it -- 55 against Kentucky last season.
   
 That was partly on the defense which had trouble getting the Wildcats off the field.
   
 Kentucky limited the ability of the Georgia defenses to make momentum changing plays by keeping it on the ground for much of the game.
   
 "If you watch them this year when -- they can overwhelm you and obviously turn the game or blow the game wide open with their defense with strip sacks, with interceptions for touchdowns, just creating havoc with their defense in predictable situations," said Kentucky coach Mark Stoops.
   
 Kentucky's 3.54 yards per rush was the highest against Georgia this season, just ahead of Alabama's 3.42.
   
 "I thought we were creative with keeping a really, really talented defense on their heels as far as some of the run game," Stoops said.
   
 "Definitely could have tackled better, a lot of things we could have done better as a defense," LeCounte said. "We've got to get back to the drawing board, because we're far from perfect. We have to fix some things and do better tackling."
   
 Georgia managed its fewest points against Kentucky since a 12-3 win in 1995 when Smart was a sophomore.
   
 The Bulldogs were missing two of their playmakers on offense Saturday in wide receiver George Pickens (undisclosed injury) and running back Kenny McIntosh (knee) who didn't make the trip but Smart said practiced last week.
   
 "They weren't well enough to be effective and play so we went with other guys," he said. "We wanted them to go. They wanted to go, they've worked really hard. They've spent a lot of time getting ready, and hopefully we get them back this week."
   
 Georgia could certainly use nose guard Jordan Davis, who had his arm in a sling after leaving the game, and defensive lineman Julian Rochester, who also left the game injured. He's started the last two games.
   
 Starting safety Lewis Cine, inside linebacker Quay Walker and cornerback Dominique Stevenson also exited injured.
   
 The losses on the defensive line forced Nazir Stackhouse, who was practicing on the scout team, to step in along with fellow freshman Warren Brinson while Christopher Smith again got the call at safety.
   
 "I don't know if all those guys were ready for that kind of physicality," Smart said, "but they better get ready because they're playing in the SEC the rest of the way."

The Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) understands that the campaigners’ concerns have been sent both to LTH and also the area’s MPs, all of whom have called for – and continue to back – the reopening plans. The politicians cite NHS England’s approval of the decision.
 The department was closed in March to allow for an increase in critical care capacity at the Royal Preston in order to cope with the expected influx in coronavirus patients.
 The unit had been operating for 12 hours a day since January 2017 following a complete closure for much of the previous year because of a shortage of senior staff – the reason given for its part-time status ever since.
 However, campaigners are concerned that the recent recruitment drive has been the result of a desire to launch a long-delayed consultation into the future of Chorley A&E – with the shortlist of options likely to focus on its permanent closure and replacement with an urgent treatment centre.
 As the LDRS revealed earlier this month, NHS England has ordered that the facility must reopen before the public can be asked for their views.
 LTH chief executive Karen Partington told the latest board meeting of the trust that the delay to the consultation risked “reputational damage” to the organisation, because of the length of time that it had been in the pipeline.
 It was first anticipated to begin in January 2019, but has been repeatedly put back because of clashes with local election periods and the emergence of several additional requirements as part of the pre-consultation process.
 The campaign group said that it is “greatly concerned that decisions are being made on a political and professional basis rather than the wellbeing and safety of residents, patients and staff”.
 “[We] will continue to bring pressure to have a full service A&E, 24/7, at Chorley & South Ribble Hospital – but we do not want this to the detriment of patient and staff safety.
 “Given that the long term plan for the service has yet to be finalised, we feel any move to reopen the A&E under unsafe conditions would be setting it up to fail and may ensure it’s permanent closure. We ask that the trust reconsiders its decision to reopen on 2nd November.”
 At the start of October, seven out of the required 12 “senior decision-maker” posts to enable the reopening of the A&E – 10 middle-grade doctors and two consultants – had been filled. LTH said that it was continuing its search for the remainder, but would use locums to plug any gaps come this week’s reopening.
 The trust was approached for comment on the campaign group’s concerns.

The Office of the Missouri State Auditor found — as first reported by Missourinet, a Jefferson City-based alliance of Show Me State radio stations covering state government — that at the time Parson called the Nov. 5 session, some $1.3 billion in federal aid dollars remained to be distributed. Locally, to date, the St. Joseph School District has received the largest independent amount of such funding. The bulk of the money received is represented by a $2.3 million relief payment ultimately signed off on by the Buchanan County Commission. The auditor’s office is held by Parson’s main re-election opponent, Nicole Galloway.
 Hegeman said that he understands Parson’s intent this time around as focused on governmental “housekeeping.” While school funding remains in question in the long run — particularly for Fiscal Year 2022 that begins July 1, 2021, but will be budgeted out in January — the Nov. 5 special session probably won’t feature weighty decisions on schools or other matters, per Hegeman’s prediction. Lawmakers are authorized to do whatever they collectively please; however, Hegeman said, the session is quite unlikely to last long.

 Republikanaren Donald Trump og Demokraten Joe Biden har lite til felles, sett bort frå høg alder.
 Medan 74-åringen Trump har brukt mesteparten av livet på å tene pengar og snakke om eigen stordom og rikdom, har 77 år gamle Biden vore folkevald heiltidspolitikar i snart 50 år.
 Begge kjenner dei rett nok Det kvite hus frå innsida, Trump etter fire år som president og Biden etter åtte år som visepresident under Barack Obama. Men der stoppar òg likskapen.
 ## Skjellsord og løgner
 Trump har under fire år som president vist fingeren til omverda og internasjonalt samarbeid, trekt USA ut av ei rekkje internasjonale avtalar og kutta USAs bidrag til FN-organisasjonar som WHO og UNRWA.
 Presidenten har òg late skjellsord og vulgære karakteristikkar hagle over alle som har ytra kritikk eller komme med innvendingar, noko som også har resultert i stor gjennomtrekk i hans eigen administrasjon.
 Tidlegare medarbeidarar har teikna eit bilete av han som impulsiv, ustabil og meir oppteken av sitt eige sjølvbilete enn eigne landsmenn sitt ve og vel. Sjølv har han hevda å vere «eit stabilt geni».
 Trump er òg teken i å framføre tusenvis av usanningar og har teikna eit merkeleg bilete av det amerikanske samfunnet og sin eigen innsats for å gjere USA «great again», som i beste fall må kunne kallast misvisande.

GBP/USD has dipped below 1.2865, a double-bottom recorded during October. While the break is yet to be confirmed, pressure is mounting after the UK announced a new lockdown, FXStreet's Analyst Yohay Elam reports. Key quotes "Reports about progress on the sensitive issues of fisheries - perhaps due to a compromise from Paris - have been holding the pound from falling. However, this temporary reprieve may fizzle out. EU and UK negotiators have had their bouts of optimism but these were often followed by reports of disagreements and occasionally break up in the talks. Yet even if a deal between Brussels and London are near, sterling grapples with other issues." "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in England. Parliament is set to approve the restrictions designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 on Wednesday, paving the way for a month-long lockdown from Thursday. If confirmed by the House of Commons, the shuttering will take place just as the Bank of England announces its rate decision on 'Super Thursday.' The BoE could follow through on its talk and set sub-zero borrowing costs, further weighing on sterling." "President Donald Trump continues trailing rival Joe Biden - yet the race is tighter in swing states than on the national level. Markets are eyeing a large stimulus bill, which would require not only a Biden victory but also for his party to win the Senate, where the race is closer." "Markets fear the prospects of a contested election - in which Trump declares victory before all the votes are counted and/or the race goes down to the wire or to the courts. Such concerns are boosting the greenback. While the greenback could fall in a relief rally, that would not happen until there is a clear result." "Below 1.2865, the next support lines were last seen in September and were stepping stones on the way up. These include 1.28 and 1.2770, and 1.2665. Some resistance is at 1.2880, which was a low point last week. It is followed by 1.2985, a wing high, and then by 1.3020."

LONDON (AP) - A British court ruled Monday against Johnny Depp in his libel case against the owner of the Sun tabloid newspaper, which labelled him a “wife beater.”In a ruling, Justice Andrew Nicol said Depp has “not succeeded in his action for libel.” He added that the defendants had shown what they published was “substantially true.”Depp sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that accused him of assaulting his wife Amber Heard. Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Heard’s U.S. counsel, said in a statement that the verdict is “not a surprise” for anyone who followed the trial in the summer.“Very soon, we will be presenting even more voluminous evidence in the U.S.,” she said. Depp is also suing Heard for $50 million in Virginia over a Washington Post story about domestic violence. The trial is due to be held next year.The Sun said the decision was a “stunning victory for press freedom” and that it had stood up and campaigned for victims of domestic abuse for more than 20 years.“Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced and we thank the Judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court,” a spokesperson for the tabloid said.Both Depp and Heard spent several days in the witness box during the three-week trial in July, giving irreconcilable accounts of their volatile relationship. The pair met on the set of 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in 2015. They separated the following year and divorced in 2017.Heard, 34, testified as the main witness for the defense, saying Depp turned into a violent alter ego he dubbed the “Monster” when under the influence of alcohol and drugs. She alleged 14 separate incidents between 2013 and 2016 in which he hit, slapped and shoved her, pulled her hair and threw bottles at her. The alleged assaults took place in glamorous settings including the couple’s luxury penthouse, Depp’s private island in the Bahamas and an executive jet. Depp, 57, branded the allegations “sick” and a “hoax” and claimed Heard was the aggressor during their relationship. He claimed that Heard hit him, even severing the tip of his finger with a thrown vodka bottle during an altercation in Australia during filming of a “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie.Depp acknowledged heavy drug use, saying he took marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and magic mushrooms, and became addicted to opioid painkillers. But he denied that drugs made him violent.“I am certainly not a violent person, especially with women,” he said.Heard insisted she was telling the truth and said she had spoken out reluctantly. “What woman has ever benefited from being a victim of domestic violence?” she asked in court.Depp’s lawyer, David Sherborne, accused Heard of wrongly donning the mantle of the #MeToo movement and called her “a wholly unreliable witness and frankly a compulsive liar.”Both sides offered testimony from friends and former employees to back their version of events, and the judge must decide which account is more credible.The decision is a big blow personally, and financially, to Depp.“The reputations of both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are tarnished irrevocably,” said Mark Stephens, a media lawyer at the law firm Howard Kennedy, ahead of the verdict. “I think that it’s going to persist, because whoever wins in this case, the way in which this case was presented, the issues that came up, particularly around gendered presentation of the case, I think that’s going to be studied for years to come.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
