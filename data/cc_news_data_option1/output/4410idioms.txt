With the electorate so divided, and so many issues swirling, it's hard to imagine who might've been swayed by a hypothetical stimulus passed in time to reach people's pockets. "My understanding is that much of the swing toward [Joe] Biden has come from independents" says Way. "And Biden is absolutely destroying Trump among independents. So that is a constituency that I think would've been affected by it. It goes hand in glove with the poor response to the COVID pandemic, which is hurting him among these constituencies. It's another thing that makes him look incapable of dealing with the crisis, either on a medical on an economic front. It may well have mattered for some number. It turns out that the election is not that close. If we were in 2016, and it was a matter of 75,000 voters in three states, it could've made a difference."

Nevertheless, many officials have resisted calls to enact measures like statewide mask mandates or stricter curbs on the size of gatherings, casting the response to the virus as a matter of individual decision-making.
 “At the end of the day, personal responsibility is the only way. People will either choose or not choose to social distance, or choose to wear a mask or not,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. “What we can do is to remind them is that personal responsibility can protect them.”
 Lee’s state is among those without a blanket mask mandate despite a study released this week showing that areas of Tennessee where people are not required to wear them are seeing the most hospitalizations.
 In Iowa, where a record 606 coronavirus patients were hospitalized Friday, one health expert said officials there had been too quick to reopen, along with several neighboring states.
 “If we follow the course that the other Midwestern states like Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota have, we’re going to have trouble keeping up,” said Dr. Ravi Vemuri, an infectious disease specialist at MercyOne hospitals.
 Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has rejected mask requirements and said Iowans must learn to live with the virus, continued this week to downplay efforts to contain it.
 On Wednesday, Reynolds, who has made frequent campaign appearances for Trump and other candidates surrounded by crowds of often maskless supporters, poked fun at Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat running in a tight Senate race, for suspending a campaign tour after a staff member was exposed to someone who tested positive.
 “Theresa didn’t get very far on her RV tour, did she?” Reynolds said. She went on to accuse Greenfield and other Democrats of “hiding in their basements.”
 The pandemic has put similar pressures on states with Democratic governors, but the politics have played out differently.
 Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, has repeatedly tried to impose restrictions but been stymied by the Republican-controlled legislature. She is considering calling lawmakers into a special session to impose a statewide mask mandate.
 In Wisconsin, where the virus has raged since September, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers pleaded with residents this week to shelter in place to slow the spread. Evers issued a formal stay-at-home order in March, but the state’s conservative Supreme Court struck it down in May. He was subsequently sued over a mask mandate and limits on gatherings in bars and restaurants.
 In Utah, which is also one of the nation’s worst hotspots, Republican Gov. Gary Herbert has ordered mask mandates and limited social gatherings to 10 people or fewer only in counties with the highest transmission rates, not the entire state. The latter measure includes exceptions for religious services and school events.
 “This is not an easy thing to enforce. As you drive down the road, you talk about people getting tickets for speeding, but how many are actually speeding?” Herbert said when asked about his resistance to broader mandates.
 Herbert said Friday he was “disgusted” after someone shot at a state health department office. The incident came a day after anti-mask protesters gathered outside the home of Utah state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn, who recommended that the state reinstate restrictions to avoid overwhelming hospitals.
 “It’s taken a really big toll on my family and myself,” Dunn said. “I think it’s really unfortunate we live in a state where people feel that it is OK to harass civil servants.”
 Herbert, who has not heeded Dunn’s recommendation, said protesters were within their rights to criticize him or other elected officials, but that they should leave state employees alone.
 “I know we’re asking a lot of the people of Utah to be patient,” the governor said. “We know that their time is valuable. I would hope that they would put that in a constructive effort.”

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked Chandigarh-based Super Multicolor Printers (P) Limited and its directors among others for allegedly causing a loss of over ₹125 crore to a consortium comprising Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and ICICI Bank.
 Among those named in the FIR are Sunil Guglani, Suman Guglani, Sahil Arora of S.A. Enterprises, Ketul Praveen Chandra Sheth and K.P.S. Enterprises. Super Multicolor Printers is in the business of offset printing.
 The company had availed itself of credit facilities to the tune of ₹190.07 crore from the consortium in December 2014. However, it is alleged that it did not repay the loans and the account turned into non-performing asset in December 2015, which caused the banks a loss of ₹125.40 crore plus interest.
 A forensic audit revealed that the funds were diverted by the accused for other purposes. The majority of the funds was directed through the current accounts of S.A. Enterprises and K.P.S. Enterprises, which are related to the borrower company. The firms were shown on paper as vendor or supplier.
 Huge quantities of raw material, ranging from 145 to 200 metric tonnes, was shown to have been transported. However, there were no transportation-related documents available on record, according to the FIR.
 It is alleged that immediately after receiving the funds, the vendors transferred them to the accounts of Shivek Labs Limited, Dunn Foods Private Limited, Super Health Care, Sky Blue Papers and York Polymer, which were all related parties or sister concerns of the accused borrower company.
 The Guglanis were also directors in Shivek Labs Limited and Dunn Foods. Mr. Guglani was a proprietor of Super Health Care, as mentioned in the FIR. Most of the sister concerns are under liquidation.

With the rise in COVID cases in some areas of Ontario, the question of the week is - what about trick-or-treat? The good news is that the pandemic doesn't seem to be putting a big dent in people's Halloween preparations. Chris Hare at Jones' Valu Mart in Thessalon, says that they are on their seventh bin of pumpkins. Jack o'lanterns and Halloween decorations are visible around town, with several new temporary cemeteries in place. Algoma has relatively few cases of COVID-19 with only three in the Sault Ste Marie area. Still, people are being cautious about the risk.
 "I was stressing over it," says Angie Gallop of Thessalon. Gallop and her partner, Gordon Graham, have two daughters aged 10 and 7. Graham, who is diabetic, is at higher risk, and Gallop's father also has health issues and is a senior. The girls are in school, but door-to-door contact is another level of risk that Gallop isn't happy about.
 The pandemic has been breaking traditions all around the world, and trick-or- treating is no exception. In its present form, with children dressed up and going door-to-door for candy, it's been around since about the 1920s, but its origins go back much further than that.
 Halloween was originally the Celtic festival of Samhain (So-een), one of the eight solar festivals in the year. Sundown marked the end of the old year, and sunrise the next day marked the beginning of the new one. The night in between belonged to neither year. Between sunset and sunrise, and the division between the world of the living and the world of the dead was thin, and spirits could cross over to the world of the living.
 Some of those spirits might be family members who had died, but some might be malevolent ghosts, or otherworldly creatures such as demons. Going out on Samhain was considered very dangerous. You might invite the spirits of your own family to the hearth, but you didn't want to meet any others. To avoid trouble, people stayed indoors and put out food to distract and propitiate the spirits. Apples were customary, being both symbolic of life and one of the few sweet things that were readily available. If you couldn't avoid going outside, a disguise might make any spirits or demons believe you were one of them. You'd be safe, or at least safer.
 When the Christian church took over pagan festivals, it declared Nov. 1 All Saints Day and Nov. 2 All Souls Day. During the Middle Ages children, and sometimes adults, dressed in disguises and went from door to door asking for food or money in exchange for prayers for the family's dead. This custom was called "soaling," or "souling" and there were special cakes called "soul cakes" which householders gave to the callers. Back as far as the 15th-century it was the custom in Britain for people to share soul cakes at Allhallowmas, which ran from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2. We have a remnant of this custom in a Christmas carol.
 "A soul-cake, a soul-cake
 Please, good missus, a soul cake.
 An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry,
 Any good thing to make us all merry."
 Even Shakespeare made a reference to this door-to-door activity. In Two Gentlemen of Verona, when Speed accuses his master of "puling (whimpering or whining) like a beggar at Hallowmas."
 Another custom that arose was mumming. Groups of adults, as well as children, went out in costume from house to house, performing plays or songs in exchange for donations of food or money. The mummers offered prayers for the dead and wishes for good fortune on the household if they were welcomed, and predictions of ill-luck if they were not.
 Sometimes the visitors went masked, or with painted or blackened faces, directly representing of the dead. In Ireland and Scotland this was called "guising," from the word "disguise". In parts of southern Ireland, groups of young people in masks went from house to house reciting verses, some of them pagan, in exchange for food. They were led by a man dressed as the White Mare, a supernatural figure whose head was a horse's skull. These representatives of the dead promised good luck in exchange for food, and bad luck if none was given. A group might threaten actual mischief.
 The custom of performing for the gift of food, and the prediction of good or bad luck, sounds like a "trick or treat" situation. Although children now just say "trick or treat" and are given candy, in earlier times they were expected to recite a poem or tell a joke in order to get their treat. In some cities in the United States it's still the custom for children to offer some such little "trick" in order to get the treat.
 As might be expected, considering the numbers of settlers from England, Ireland and Scotland, most of the common North American traditions are British or Celtic in origin. It's hard to say if they were brought over wholesale with the settlers. We have no records of early Canadian Halloween customs. In fact, they are not documented in Canada until 1928. The first mention of "guising" occurs in a Kingston, Ont., newspaper, with a photograph of a girl in costume.
 In 1947 some children's magazines and radio shows were mentioning trick-or- treating, and it was shown in the Peanuts comic strip for the first time in 1951. (The first appearance of The Great Pumpkin was Oct. 26, 1959.) By 1952, when Walt Disney released a cartoon called "Trick or Treat", the custom was firmly established in the form we know today. In 1953 UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, started the first campaign to collect money for children.
 Canada does have the first documented mention of the phrase "trick or treat" in North America. On Nov. 4, 1927, the Blackie, Alberta, Herald described "youthful tormentors at back door and front demanding edible plunder by the word 'trick or treat." If they weren't given something, they took gates, water barrels, wagon wheels or anything they could move and put them in the street. The paper refers to the youths - perhaps jokingly - as "robbers." This is not an isolated attitude.
 While trick-or-treating may be celebrated as a venerable tradition, it's not universally welcomed. In England, where souling is an old custom, the phrase "trick or treat" was not used until the last few decades, and is seen as menacing, demanding candy with threats. Others consider the practice to be begging and think it demeaning. Every year someone denounces Halloween as a commercial money-grab, and with some reason. People spend millions of dollars on costumes and candy. In the last few decades the practice of decorating for Halloween has become increasingly popular, as well. Fake cemeteries, automated corpses popping out of coffins, spooky lights and sounds are all good fun and big business.
 Halloween has had its ups and downs. It's gone from being one of the great festivals in the Celtic year to an occasion for children to dress up as their favourite cartoon character and have a sugar binge. Prayers for the dead and marauding spirits have given way to candy kisses and, occasionally, egging.
 To return to our question of the week, what about trick-or-treat in the time of COVID? Masks have always been a safety concern, especially because a mask that covers the upper half of the face can restrict vision. This year they're doubly important - one for disguise, and one for protection. Algoma Public Health advises that children need to wear a COVID mask as well as the one that goes with their costume. This is especially true if they are going door-to- door.
 They may not, however, have to go right up to the door. People are coming up with innovative ways to distribute candy while maintaining social distance. A simple one is the remote treat table, a card table on the lawn or driveway from which trick-or-treaters can help themselves. If you decide to do that, Algoma Public Health advises putting out separate, spaced treats, such as bags of chips, rather than a bowlful of candy that kids put their hands into.
 Some inventive sorts have made chutes from PVC pipe or eaves-trough. They can stand at the top of a porch stair and slide the treats down to the little goblins as they turn up. Whether or not anyone has yet thought of catapulting treats out to the kids is still unknown.
 As for Gallop, her daughters settled the question of trick-or-treat themselves.
 "I was prepared with the whole speech," Gallop said, "about how this something we had to deal with, and that trick-or-treating might not be possible. Then I thought, why not just ask the girls?"
 Gallop's daughters surprised her by saying they didn't want to trick-or-treat because they didn't want to bring COVID home to their father or grandfather. The ten-year-old said that both her best friends were going out, but she was not. But that didn't mean they were blowing off the whole celebration.
 "We'll decorate the house and play spooky music," Gallop said. "We'll dress up, and we might put a card table out on the driveway with treats on it."
 She also plans to take the girls to her parents' house on the beach, have a bonfire and tell stories.
 "It's full moon this year for Halloween," she said. "We could tell full moon stories and take a moonlight walk down the beach. Maybe it can be a new Halloween tradition for us, one that can grow with the girls as they grow up."
 We're all tired of quarantine and social distance, and the ways in which it has affected how we live day-to-day. But we've all found ways to cope, from making sourdough bread to learning how to hold a Zoom conference with family or friends. Halloween is still going to happen. Make a new tradition.
 Or, what the heck, bar the doors and huddle around your fire, just like the ancient Celts did. It's the original Samhain tradition, after all. Give it a 21st-century twist and eat the candy kisses yourself.

In addition to GAAP-based measures of net income, management periodically reviews certain non-GAAP measures of pre-tax income that factor out the impact of discrete income or expense items that, although not unusual, infrequent or nonrecurring, tend to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or are based on events that are not necessarily indicative of the Company's core operating earnings as a financial institution. An example includes the provision for loan and lease losses, which, although a core part of the Company's operating activities, may fluctuate significantly based on the level of loan growth in a quarter, changes in economic factors or other events during the quarter. Examples of items that are not necessarily considered by management to be core to the Company's operating earnings include accretion and amortization of discounts, premiums and intangible assets associated with purchase accounting. In its own analysis, management has defined operating income as a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net income for the following items:

Speaking Truth to Power. I’ve used that motto often during my campaign. But what exactly does that mean? I think the words Robert F. Kennedy spoke in 1966, in Cape Town, South Africa, to a still apartheid nation, give a concise description. “Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality of those who seek to change a world which yields most painfully to change.”
 Speaking truth to power is not widely appreciated or understood. Two recent examples from state politics: not challenging caucus leaders who hold a bonding bill hostage to score cheap political points, delaying critical infrastructure needs, a bonding bill that eventually passed 64-3 in the Senate; or being silent when the minority leader refers to the Senate not confirming one of Gov Walz’s appointments as “an execution.” In both cases, Rep. John Petersburg failed to speak truth to power.
 Speaking Truth to Power is not confined to politics. In everyday life there are examples where it’s easier and safer to remain silent rather than speaking truth to power. Imagine if surgical staff didn’t speak up when they see a surgeon’s direction will cause harm, or if the first mate of a cruise ship advises the captain that they are too close to shore, but backs down to the ship captain’s order to keep going closer, which led to catastrophic consequences. (See Costa Concordia, 2012).
 The problem is, speaking truth to power oftentimes can be a lose-lose situation. In the tragic murder of George Floyd, if the rookie officer spoke up when he recognized something was wrong, persisted to challenge his superior and turn Mr. Floyd over, Mr. Floyd may have lived. But if he had, he likely would have been shunned by senior officers, maybe written up for insubordination, a ruined career, and no one would ever know. Unfortunately, he didn’t persist in his challenge to the ranking officer who was clearly in the wrong, and now is facing murder charges with the world his jury.
 Truth to power has also been described as “Intelligent Disobedience.” We all face situations where we are confronted with a choice of action or inaction, some choices easier than others. We all need to be aware of and practice intelligent disobedience in our daily lives. To do so can be a challenge in the workplace, for example, speaking up to a manager or business owner may risk their employment and family security.
 Elected officials have a particular responsibility and obligation to lead and speak truth to power no matter what the consequences may be. As Barry Goldwater would say, the best senators and congressmen are “Courageous Truth Tellers.” In today’s political environment, elected courageous truth tellers are often soon to be “former elected officials.” (See Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Sen. Corker, R-Tenn., and many others both nationally and locally.)
 So, we all need to do our part. To sustain and preserve the democracy we have inherited, we all need to take personal ownership of the conduct of our governmental institutions and the leaders we elect. We should encourage and support “courageous truth tellers” to speak truth to power, even if we sometimes disagree with their judgment. If we continue to elect officials who patronize us and enable their service to be dictated by blind party loyalty, we will continue to have dysfunctional government. At the end of the day, “the government” is ALL OF US and a reflection of who we are. It doesn’t have to be this way; we can do better.

So could we see a second stimulus during the lame-duck session? "I kind of doubt it, but I'm not sure," says Way. "But the reason I doubt it is because the real reason we haven't had a [second] stimulus is the Republicans in the Senate. And they're deeply divided on this. And my understanding is that the calculation of a lot of the Republicans in the Senate who aren't up for reelection this year is looking ahead to the next election. They don't want to be on record supporting a big government program that expands welfare programs. These are policies that are, in the long run, anathema to Republican ideology and policies.

SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A former pot grower and jail escapee convicted in the kidnapping and torture of a marijuana dispensary owner in Southern California eight years ago was sentenced Friday to life in prison. Hossein Nayeri was ordered to serve two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, one for each kidnapping charge, the Orange County Register reported. Superior Court Judge Gregg L. Prickett also sentenced Nayeri to a third consecutive term of seven years to life for the torture charge. A jury last year found Nayeri guilty for the 2012 abduction he carried out with the help of two friends in a plot to locate $1 million they believed the dispensary owner had buried in the Mojave desert. No money was ever found. The three broke into a Newport Beach home and tied up the dispensary owner, along with the girlfriend of the man who owned the house, and forced them into a van. During a drive into the desert, the men tortured the dispensary owner with rubber piping, a stun gun and a blow torch, demanding he give them the $1 million and ignoring his pleas that he didn’t have the money. When they arrived in the desert, the kidnappers cut off the dispensary owner’s penis. They left him and the woman, still bound, behind and drove off. The woman and dispensary owner survived, though authorities were unable to recover his missing body part. Investigators ultimately identified Nayeri and Kyle Handley and Ryan Kevorkian as the main suspects. Naomi Rhodus, Kevorkian’s estranged wife, was accused of purchasing the weapons used in the kidnapping and helping to rent the van. Nayeri fled to Iran but was ultimately arrested. While awaiting trial, Nayeri teamed up with two other inmates to lead a daring escape from Orange County jail, spending a little more...

"Trophies are important, period," said Toronto midfielder Nick DeLeon. "They don't come around often ... But for me more importantly we've got to get back on the right foot. I think the game against New York was a step in the right direction. We were just playing with a little more bite, which we were lacking in the previous game."
 Toronto entertains expansion Inter Miami on Sunday before travelling to the Red Bulls on Nov. 8. TFC needs to win both games and hope that the Union tie or lose their remaining contests.
 Philadelphia closes out with games Sunday in Columbus and Nov. 8 against New England at Subaru Park, where it has won all eight games this season
 Toronto's bid to finish first overall in the 26-team league took a body blow when it was thrashed 5-0 last weekend in Philadelphia, tying the teams on points. The Union then moved three points ahead midweek with a 2-1 win over Chicago while Toronto lost 1-0 to NYCFC.
 While home-field advantage mean less to Toronto given it is playing out of East Hartford rather than BMO Field due to the pandemic, reducing travel in the COVID era is welcome. The trophy has also been one of TFC's season goals.
 Due to pandemic-related game cancellations, MLS has decided that 2020 playoff qualification will be decided by points per game rather than total points. Philadelphia is currently at 2.1 points a game compare to 1.95 for Toronto.
 Even if TFC wins its last two games, it will need help. If it does claim maximum points and Philadelphia wins one of its two remaining games, they would finish with the same points per game (2.04) and both would have 14 wins.
 That would mean goal difference would decide the tie, with Philadelphia currently holding a 16-goal edge on that score.
 That is assuming COVID doesn't affect either of their remaining schedules.
 Toronto hoisted the Supporters' Shield in 2017 when it also won the MLS Cup and Canadian Championship. It averaged 2.03 points a game that year in going 20-5-9 during the regular season.
 Philadelphia is on a roll, undefeated in six games (5-0-1) since a 2-1 loss to Toronto on Oct. 3. It has lost just once in 12 games (9-1-2). Toronto had been on a nine-game unbeaten streak (7-0-2) prior to the recent mini-slide.
 TFC trained in the snow Friday at a local baseball stadium. After hearing snow mentioned in the forecast, coach Greg Vanney said he expected a minor flurry.
 "It literally has not stopped snowing the entire day," he said. "We again had to shovel snow off the baseball diamond outfield to create some space for us to move around."
 "My toes were numb," said DeLeon.
 The TFC players got into the spirit of things with "a lot of snowballs being thrown."
 Local authorities are allowing up to 5,000 fans into the game, a first for Toronto in East Hartford. Light rain is forecast for Sunday night

Total loans averaged $609.6 million during 3Q2020, compared to $557.5 million during 2Q2020, an increase of $52.1 million, or 9.3%. The linked quarter growth in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in response to loan growth, as well as a modest reserve build in light of the current economic environment.

“It’s terrible for seniors," Preheim said. "There is no good way for it to happen. I don’t even know how to compare something like this to, for an example, our spring sport seniors last year who didn’t get to have a season at all. Or these kids who had a season, and then right when it gets to tournament time, with no notice whatsoever their season is over."
 Adams head coach Antwon Jones said he learned about the forfeit through his athletic department Friday afternoon. The Eagles will have a two-hour practice on Saturday before returning to a normal practice schedule next week, Jones said.
 “I sent out a message to our team giving them tonight off and reminding them to stay away from parties and things they don’t need to be around," Jones said. "Take care of business, and we will be back in the morning to practice.”
 Since its 8-5 season in 2015, Adams has not reached the sectional championship. Then Jones took over and has since collected a 17-33 record. He went a combined 6-24 the past three seasons before rebounding in 2020.
 “We have no choice but to move on," Jones said. "Obviously I feel bad for their seniors not getting in with a game that they were anticipating on playing. It’s sad for them and other seniors around the country. Just pray and hope that our team is able to stay healthy, take care of business and continue to do the right things.
 "As you know in this day and age, you can do the right things and it can still get you. It’s one of those things where it saddened me for their players, and just the fact alone that we don’t get to play a game tonight.
 "But it’s time to get ready for our next opponent, which is the winner of the Mishawaka/Goshen game. I’m grateful that we will be able to host the sectional championships at (TCU) School Field this upcoming Friday.”
 Forfeiting the Adams game clinched Concord’s first losing season under head coach Craig Koehler. The Minutemen have reached at least the sectional championship in three of Koehler’s six seasons and compiled a 42-21 record.
 “I hope this is the worst thing that happens to them out of (COVID-19)," Preheim said. "I hope that missing tonight’s game is the worst impact on any of their lives out of (COVID-19). Because if it is, they are going to be fine.”

Attard said Starship Jubilee came out of the Mile just fine and he's been happy with her workouts. He adds there's been no mention of this possibly being the mare's final race.
 "We've always taken a one-race approach with her and we're kind of heading into (Breeders;' Cup) with her now with the same kind of mindset," he said. "We're trying to get her to this race as best prepared as we can be.
 "We'll kind of enjoy the moment, let her run and hopefully she does to the best of her ability. Then we'll decide afterwards."
 And while a Breeders' Cup victory would only add to Starship Jubilee's amazing story, Attard said there'll be no expectations placed upon the horse at Keeneland.
 "Obviously it (Breeders' Cup win) would be a great story and another chapter in an illustrious career," Attard said. "Regardless, though, if she were to not come up with a typical race like she normally does, we're still going to hold our heads high with her.
 "She's a multiple Grade 1 winner now and you have to think about where she's come from and what she's accomplished. She's definitely going to be a horse that kind of goes down in the history books."
 Surprisingly, Starship Jubilee hasn't mellowed with age.
 "She's very aggressive, she's a very feisty mare with plenty of attitude," Attard said. "She's not a laid-back filly or mare that you can turn the other way with.
 "You've got to keep your eyes peeled at all times because she's not shy about biting at you or kicking at you. Don't let your guard down."
 Attard said that competitive nature becomes quite evident on the track, even during workouts.
 "When she's out there training and sees other horses, she wants to go and catch them and run them down," he said. "Again, she just loves what she does."

If - and that's the operative word here - 'if' the Ontario Hockey League can actually begin its season on Feb. 4, 2021, we can expect a change in the way in which some clubs operate.
 A 40-game regular season is certainly more of a sprint than a marathon, when compared to a typical 68-game slate.
 Over 68 games, clubs are far more likely to work  their rookies or inexperienced second-year players into the lineup.
 In a league where the lifespan of players is short, development is critical.
 Teams are determined to acclimate their kids to the level of play in Major A hockey.
 But in a 40-game regular season, and with only four of 10 teams in each conference qualifying for the playoffs, the OHL's better teams won't be as concerned about the maturation of kids.
 They can't afford to be.
 A club's best lineup - regardless of the age of the players in it - must be iced almost every night.
 Getting into the playoffs, a given for so many teams when 16 out of 20 clubs qualify, will be harder than ever.
 It's not the way clubs would prefer to operate. But in a short season with a limited playoff field, what choice do they have?
 Take the 2020-2021 Soo Greyhounds. If the Sault is awarded the Memorial Cup, slated for June 17-27, the Hounds will obviously be in go-for-it mode.
 Through trades, general manager Kyle Raftis will be determined to make his team as strong as possible, almost regardless of the cost in future assets.
 Within their plan, there'll be less room for the development of young players than during past seasons.
 But even if the city of Oshawa gets the Cup, these Hounds are expected to be good - maybe very good.
 They'll be determined to not only make the Western Conference playoffs, but to seriously contend for a league crown.
 Starting a short season quickly - something I asked Raftis about on Thursday - is obviously a must. So is winning as often as possible with a lineup geared towards championship success as the primary goal.
 The change in the philosophy of the OHL's top teams, I believe, will be illustrated in how the Greyhounds handle Sault native Connor Toms.
 The 16-year-old (2004 birth year) defenceman, highly-touted by the Greyhounds, was chosen in the third round of the 2020 OHL draft.
 In a normal year, depending on what he showed at camp and how he developed, a player such as Toms would likely play in maybe 40 games, filling in here and there behind a number of accomplished, veteran OHL rearguards.
 The plan would be for him to get his feet wet, prior to experiencing success in the remainder of his OHL career.
 However, in a 40-game sprint to the finish line, working a young player with lots of potential, such as Toms, into the lineup becomes more problematic.
 Ditto for the Hounds other 2020 draft choices, with the exception of centre Bryce McConnell-Barker, taken fourth overall and considered OHL ready today.
 Depending on what happens with the Soo Thunderbirds and the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League season, it seems to me Toms - and the Greyhounds - will be better served with the young man playing a full NOJHL season.
 As for the Hounds other 2020 picks, in past years you'd see the Soo carry - and develop - multiple youngsters.
 In a shortened 2021 campaign, for a club expecting to contend, that won't make as much sense.
 As for the season beginning in early February, I have my doubts.
 The border closure remains a major hurdle. Does anyone believe it will open in January or February?
 What about fans in the stands? Will paying customers be allowed in and, if so, will enough feel comfortable attending OHL games?
 And what about body contact? Right now, it wouldn't be allowed. That obviously has to change in order for the OHL to begin a new season.

Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) has announced that the country’s 600 MHz spectrum auction will be held in March 2019.
 The Canadian government is also setting aside 43 percent of the spectrum—30 MHz—for smaller and regional wireless operators. According to a statement by the Honourable Navdeep Bains, minister of innovation, science and economic cevelopment, “Competition is a key driver of innovative and affordable telecommunications services. This is an important step toward more choices, lower prices and higher quality cell phone services for Canadians. Auctioning 600 MHz spectrum will encourage competition, support new and emerging technologies, and enable Canadians to benefit from high-quality services at a better price."
 As with the FCC’s Incentive Auction in the U.S., which ended in April 2017, Canada’s 600 MHz repurposing process will require a TV channel repack to clear the spectrum for wireless carriers. In Canada, as in the U.S., wireless audio equipment operators will be expected to vacate the 600 MHz spectrum as soon as the carriers begin their new services.
 The FCC and Industry Canada, the government department overseeing economic development, agreed in August 2015 to harmonize their respective 600 MHz band plans. (Industry Canada was absorbed into ISED when Justin Trudeau became prime minister in November 2015.) However, Canada has been slow off the mark, only now announcing an auction date that is two years into the FCC’s 39-month repack schedule.
 Canada’s 600 MHz spectrum auction is unlikely to follow the FCC’s incentive model, whereby TV channels sold their spectrum to telecom companies, as two entities, BCE and Rogers Communications, own both broadcasters and wireless carriers.
 The spectrum set-aside is intended to level the playing field for those carriers with less than 10 percent of the market, such as Shaw’s Freedom Mobile and Quebecor’s Videotron, and increase competition, ultimately to the benefit of consumers. Canada’s wireless telecom business is dominated by the Big Three: Rogers Wireless, Bell Mobility (a division of BCE) and Telus Mobility.
 The ISED band plan includes a total of 70 MHz in seven paired blocks of 5+5 MHz with a duplex gap from 652 MHz to 663 MHz and a guard band from 614 MHz to 617 MHz. Active mobile network operators with less than 10 percent of national wireless subscriber market share will be able to bid for spectrum in the 30 MHz set-aside. All service providers, including the Big Three, will be able to bid on the remaining 40 MHz.
