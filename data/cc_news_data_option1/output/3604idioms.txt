It has been a mixed year for emerging market investment banking, given disappointing activity in key markets such as Russia, Brazil and Nigeria, and modest appetite for FX and credit products, amid rate volatility and the abrupt strengthening of the dollar in local-currency terms. As ever, investment banks with cross-product capabilities, from flow to events-driven business, have managed to weather the deal-flow cycles.
 Meanwhile, the return of Asian equity capital markets, global M&A deals, and the continued health of primary debt markets, albeit a low-margin business, have boosted emerging market investment banks’ origination earnings.
 Citi still commands the industry-leading markets and origination business, backed by its global corporate banking franchise.

An FIR has been registered on against unidentified persons who made a malicious audio clip two weeks back "to lower the confidence of the public in the medical facilities at Mohali Civil Hospital," deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has said.
 Strict action will be initiated against those who spread rumours on Covid-19, he added.
 Unverified, misleading, malicious information on social media will invite action under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.
 "Do not forward Covid related messages without verification . We are monitoring such posts on social media. Legal action will be taken against those who spread false news," said Dayalan, .
 WhatsApp admins sharing unverified, misleading Covid-19 information were asked to be careful.
 "Rumors spread fast on social media, leading to unwanted panic among the people. So, our cyber cell sleuths are on guard. We have stepped up online surveillance to identify senders of such fake news, frivolous, unfounded Covid-19 related messages and other content," Dayalan said.
 "Whereas the administration is making all out efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the district, certain antisocial elements are spreading all sorts of rumours on social media, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others. This does not just create panic, but also is extremely discouraging for the frontline corona warriors, he added.
 The entire government machinery was working round the clock and making all out efforts to keep people safe from the virus, "but a few bad elements are hampering the process by posting and sharing unfounded messages. No one would be allowed to sabotage our pandemic control efforts; we will take sternest action in the book against the miscreants," the DC said.

BOSTON (AP) — TV actresses. A well-known fashion designer. Business leaders. Entrepreneurs.
 One by one, they have admitted to using their wealth to bribe and cheat their kids' ways into top universities across the country, often as athletic recruits for sports their children didn't even play.
 The highest-profile defendants who were left in what's been called Operation Varsity Blues — “Full House” star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli — are now heading to prison. Just 15 of the nearly 60 people charged in the sordid scheme that rocked the U.S. educational system are still fighting the charges.
 Where the case stands and what happens next:
 ___
 PRISON TIME
 The prison sentences for the prominent parents charged in the case have ranged from a couple of weeks to nine months.
 Loughlin, who gained fame for her role as the wholesome Aunt Becky in the sitcom “Full House," was recently ordered to serve two months behind bars and Giannulli was sentenced to five months for paying $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California. They are supposed to report to prison Nov. 19.

This month, Game Pass, the tech firm's Netflix-like subscription gaming service that launched in 2017, merged with Microsoft's Azure-powered cloud gaming platform xCloud. The result, says Choudhry, is a service that streams high-resolution, computationally intensive games with low latency to a broad spectrum of devices, including mobile phones and low-powered or aging desktop computers.
 "Historically, you needed a high-end PC to play games," says Choudhry. "What we've done by merging the cloud with Game Pass is enable people to stream games from the cloud on their smartphones and tablets, in addition to on their consoles and on their PC."
 To provide a cloud gaming experience that feels as responsive as an app installed on your PC, the new Game Pass relies on a number of integrated technologies. The service runs a customized version of the Xbox console operation in the Azure cloud deployed to over 60 global regions. The company also works with local and regional telecommunication companies to optimize data packet routing. If your session is interrupted or the internet connection is shaky, Game Pass uses machine learning to figure out when packets are lost and keeps your session alive until you're able to reconnect.
 Cloud streaming and packet optimization are designed specifically to enhance the Game Pass mobile experience. Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube are successful in large part because of their popular mobile apps. Choudhry says that gaming is a natural evolution of streaming technology. "We want people to have access to a catalog of games. I'm trying to bring that experience to their platforms," he says.

The African wild dog distinguishes itself from rival predators like lions and hyenas by using the unique hunting style of chasing prey over long distances until the target collapses from exhaustion, instead of relying upon speed, strength or stealth. A comprehensive new anatomical study of this endangered species, also known as the African painted dog or Cape hunting dog, has identified crucial evolutionary adaptations for endurance running in the animal's forelimb bones, muscles and ligaments that help sustain its life on the run.

Mohali An FIR has been registered on against unidentified persons who made a malicious audio clip two weeks back "to lower the confidence of the public in the medical facilities at Mohali Civil Hospital," deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has said.Strict action will be initiated against those who spread rumours on Covid-19, he added. Unverified, misleading, malicious information on social media will invite action under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. "Do not forward Covid related messages without verification . We are monitoring such posts on social media. Legal action will be taken against those who spread false news," said Dayalan, .WhatsApp admins sharing unverified, misleading Covid-19 information were asked to be careful. "Rumors spread fast on social media, leading to unwanted panic among the people. So, our cyber cell sleuths are on guard. We have stepped up online surveillance to identify senders of such fake news, frivolous, unfounded Covid-19 related messages and other content," Dayalan said. "Whereas the administration is making all out efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the district, certain antisocial elements are spreading all sorts of rumours on social media, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others. This does not just create panic, but also is extremely discouraging for the frontline corona warriors, he added.The entire government machinery was working round the clock and making all out efforts to keep people safe from the virus, "but a few bad elements are hampering the process by posting and sharing unfounded messages. No one would be allowed to sabotage our pandemic control efforts; we will take sternest action in the book against the miscreants," the DC said.

BRITS – The Water and Sanitation Department has warned of a ‘grim picture’ for Gauteng’s water supply as the Vaal Dam levels continue to decline.
 In a statement on Thursday, the department said dam levels dropped from 37.6% last week to 37.0% in this week.
 “The relentless decline, which has continued for months, has placed the dam in a poorer state when compared to the levels of last year in the same week when it stood at 58.6%.”
 Other dams in the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) that marked a drop in levels include the Grootdraai dam in Mpumalanga, the Bloemhof Dam in the North West – while levels at the Sterkfontein Dam in the Free State remained unchanged.
 At the same time, the department said it is concerned by the continued drop in the levels of the Mohale and Katse dams in Lesotho.
 “Becoming emptier with each passing week, the Mohale Dam looks set to hit rock bottom as it fell from 6.0% last week to 5.3% this week. The dam’s situation looks unlikely to improve any time soon as in the comparative period last year it floated at 33.0%. In an equally dire situation is the Katse Dam, the levels of which are worsening weekly. The dam dipped from 27.5% last week to 26.3% presently.”
 It said that despite the decline in its levels this week, the IVRS remained ‘relatively healthy’.
 This week, the IVRS dropped from 60.4% last week to 59.7% this week. During the comparative period last year, it was higher and steady at 65.7%.
 “The IVRS consists of 14 dams, including the Vaal Dam which is key for water supply of industries such as the energy and chemical company Sasol and the electricity generating giant Eskom.”
 The department has urged consumers to limit the usage of water to help curb the problem.

 Por su parte, Eudald Domenech, managing director & Service Architect, relato que "los consumidores ultimamente se preguntan ¿por qué pagamos tanto cuando la mayoria de lo que queremos ver está en Netflix y Prime Video? Ha nacido el fenomeno de los cord-cutters, aquellos que prefieren contratar ancho de banda y movil a un operadora asequible, aunque de calidad, y confeccionarse por si mismos su paquete de entretenimiento. Tivify ha sido creada para reunir el entretenimiento de todos los usuarios de una manera facil y asequible y dar servicio a los cord-cutters."

When England take on Australia in a bilateral ODI series starting Friday in Manchester, all eyes will be on the battle between England's batting might against Australia's well known pace bowlers. The likes of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins will have to be at their best against an in form and rampaging English batting line-up.
 This will also be the first time England will host Australia at home as champions of the 50-over format, a favour they would have long wanted to return to the Aussies who have won the title five times. But the Aussies are a handful on a cricket field, whether champions or not.
 Aaron Finch and his team have not had a great run in the format since the ICC World Cup of 2019, where they lost to England in the semi-final. One reason for that could be the indifferent form of their pace spearhead Mitchell Starc.
 ALSO READ: Steve Smith picks world's best ODI batsman, reserves high praise for two rising stars of India
   
   
 Starc has been a prolific bowler in ODIs, and his record in the ICC World Cup is outstanding to say the least. But 2020 is proving to be a tough year for the left handed paceman. In six matches so far, Starc has accounted for only 6 wickets and his average is well above 50. This is the wort performance by the paceman in ODIs in a calendar year since making his debut in 2010, when he had played only 2 matches and picked up 4 wickets. This following graph will further elucidate what we intent to talk about.
 2020 has indeed been a year of struggle for the paceman as his average and economy has been the worst for a calendar year.
 What is worrisome is the fact that Starc's part record in ODIs against England in England too has been mediocre at best. He has picked up 12 wickets in 8 matches at an average of 37.75 and strike rate 36.8. His overall record in England though is fabulous but that is on account of his performances against other teams.
 So, the paceman needs to reinvent this summer in England and he needs to come out firing on all cylinders to make amends to both his 2020 numbers as well as his numbers against the hosts.
 His new ball partnership with Cummins will be crucial if Australia are to upset the world champion in their backyard. For the record, the last bilateral series between the two teams in England resulted in a 5-0 whitewash for the hosts, but that was Australian team in a transitional phase after the 'Sandpapergate' controversy.

He said, "It was just a matter of finding a solution that was simple, effective, and could be put on conveniently with one hand."
 As long-time mask wearers, we physicians can assure the public that they will get used to masks - they will become second nature. The benefit to everyone is well worth that initial awkwardness. If everyone wears a mask consistently, we can all go back to work, school, and normal life much sooner. And if our culture gets used to wearing masks, we might even wear them when we feel ill from a cold or the flu, helping prevent even more illness and death.

The ride is called an Iron Man because when the trail is smooth it is fun to go fast. You can ride so that you can see a lot of a little scenery, but you don’t go very far. On the Iron Man, we see a little of a lot of scenery and we go far. Threatening to ride fast reduced the number of riders to a manageable group of seven machines.
 The NUATV Club plans to hold at least one of these per year and this year we chose the Arapeen ATV Trail in San Pete County. We staged at 400 South just east of U.S. Highway 89 in Ephraim, which is the marked access to Ephraim Canyon.
 I have gone up and down this canyon many times to access the Skyline Trail. The New Canyon Trail takes off the canyon road and it being an inviting looking trail, I have wanted to ride it. Locating it on the map, it appeared to connect with the Skyline Trail where we wanted to go.
 After about 3 miles, we turned off onto this new trail, and what a fun trail it turned out to be. It is wide enough for UTVs and smooth enough to go fast. We zipped along this wooded path through some beautiful scenery. Making a half loop around Dusterburgs Hill, we crossed Fred’s Flat and Fred was not even with us on this ride.
 Joining the Ephraim Canyon road, we made our connection with the Skyline Trail and turned north. I never fail to enjoy describing the Skyline Trail and how much fun it is to ride. This trail is a part of the Great Western Trail — a 3,000-mile trail system connecting Canada to Mexico through five western states. It is designed to be a multiple-use trail to accommodate motorized and nonmotorized users. While the nonmotorized part exists, sections of the motorized route are still in the developing stages.
 The Skyline Trail is situated at an elevation of above 10,000 feet. From the time we joined it until we turned down Potters Canyon and headed east, it felt like we were riding on top of the world — the views were amazing.
 When I say “we,” I mean the royal we, because I missed the turn and continued on for a couple of miles before I realized that no one was following me. Turning around, I backtracked and found them waiting for me at the turn I was supposed to have taken. Acting like I meant to do that, they let me take the lead again.
 Our descent down Potters Canyon brought us to Potters Pond where we found a picnic table and broke out lunch. The pond is actually two ponds situated at the mouth of Bacon Rind Canyon.
 After our break, we joined the Miller’s Flat Road and traveled south toward Joe’s Valley Reservoir. This was also a road that satisfied the need for speed.
 Following Indian Creek and then Lowery Water, one of five creeks that feed Joe’s Valley Reservoir, we turned onto Highway 29 and passed by the west side of the reservoir.
 Making a turn at a sign marking the Orange Olsen Cabins, we turned back north and followed trail No. 5 — the Reeder Canyon Trail. At the mouth of Reeder Canyon, the trail is restricted to 50 inches.
 The Reeder Canyon Trail is one of the prettiest trails I have ever ridden. It is just challenging enough to be fun and the scenery is wonderful. The trail winds through tall pines and thick groves of aspen. Because of the challenges, the speeds are slow enough to enjoy a lot of a little scenery. The 50 inch restriction made the trail just as wide as our machines, which made the ride extra fun on this twisty trail through the woods.
 Joining the Skyline at the top of Reeder Canyon, we headed back to the junction that took us down Ephraim Canyon. The horse had seen the barn, so to speak, so we did not take the extra time to ride the New Canyon Trail back into town. We were thinking about warm showers and hot meals.
 We made it back to town finishing a ride of about 93 miles. Late summer is the best time to ride the Skyline to avoid snow banks on the trail. When you go, take plenty of water, keep the rubber side down and enjoy the elevation variation on the Arapeen Trail.

NEW YORK (AP) — Century 21 Stores — a destination for bargain hunters looking for fat deals on designer dresses and shoes, cosmetics and housewares for nearly 60 years — has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is winding down its business, shutting all 13 stores across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida. Century 21 joins more than two dozen retailers who have filed for bankruptcy since the pandemic which forced non-essential stores to temporarily close. In a statement, the New York-based company said that the decision followed nonpayment by the company’s insurance providers of approximately $175 million due under policies put in place to protect against losses stemming from business interruption. That insurance money helped it rebuild its flagship store, a magnet for locals and tourists in downtown Manhattan after it was damaged by the 9/11 attacks, the company said. “We now have no viable alternative but to begin the closure of our beloved family business because our insurers, to whom we have paid significant premiums every year for protection against unforeseen circumstances like we are experiencing today, have turned their backs on us at this most critical time,” said Century 21 co-CEO Raymond Gindi in statement. Gindi said that if Century 21 had received “any meaningful portion\" of the insurance proceeds, it would have been able “to save thousands of jobs and weather the storm in hopes of another incredible recovery.\" The company said that it's removing from the bankruptcy court a lawsuit pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against several of its insurance providers based on their failure to compensate the company for its losses under the policies. The company is requesting that the bankruptcy court expedite the adjudication of the suit for the benefit of its...
