But U.S. officials all along have been suspicious of Sessions' activities in Venezuela. Sessions had no obvious links to the country besides writing a letter in 2004 to the country's banking regulators in support of financier Allen Stanford, a former Sessions donor who in 2012 was convicted in Texas and sentenced to 110 years in prison for running a $7 billion-plus Ponzi scheme.

The Karnataka government on Monday decided to enforce complete and full lockdown in four major areas of the state capital, following a sharp rise in the coronavirus cases.
 At a cabinet meeting called today to take stock of the situation, Yediyurappa decided to enforce complete shutdown in KR Market, Chamarajapete, Kalasipalya and Chickpete.
 Briefing reporters after the review meeting, minister for revenue and municipal administration R Ashoka said that some of the quarantined are leaving their phones behind and roaming around, thus evading strict government regulations. He warned that police would register a criminal case against those breaking quarantine rules. The government has also promised to notify tariff rates for treatment in private hospitals shortly.
 In the recent past, the government has been an active votary for opening up the state for more activities. The same willingness to open the economy was conveyed by chief minister BS Yediyurappa in the chief ministers' video conference with PM Modi.
 The development follows after the state saw its biggest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 453 new virus cases being registered on Sunday. Out of them 196 were from Bengaluru.
 On Monday, the state capital at 126 new cases accounted for half of the Covid-19 cases registered today - 249. Bengaluru (urban and rural) with 958 cases account for nearly a third of all active cases in the state.
 Incidentally unlike in the past where spikes were due to an influx of people coming back from different states, contact history of the new patients indicates that it has been locally transmitted.
 Till date Karnataka has reported 9,399 Covid-19 positive cases with 152 deaths and 3,523 active cases.

"It has been close to 10 days now. Though we were working on our fitness during the lockdown, there is no substitute to hitting the nets and it feels great. We are following all the government guidelines while practising," Vasavada, man of the match in the Ranji Trophy final against Bengal, told PTI on Monday.
 While all professional cricketers will need four to six weeks for regaining match fitness, the task is a tad tougher for the bowlers, who are at a bigger risk of getting injured after a long break.
 "JD bhai (Unadkat) also joined us recently and is gradually increasing his time in the nets just like all of us. He is bowling without using saliva on the ball (recently banned by the ICC).
 "As for us (Pujara and I), we started with batting sessions of 10-15 minutes and plan to increase the intensity gradually. We have also some net bowlers who are based out of Rajkot.
 "Initially, you need some time to get your reflexes back but now batting feels normal," added Vasavada.
 With cases rapidly rising across the country, it is tough to predict when the domestic season kicks off. It is supposed to begin in August but it looks unlikely at this stage.
 The national team players including Pujara are also going though an uncertain period and don't know when they can assemble for a training camp.
 Pujara's next assignment most likely will be the tour of Australia in December.

I think that's the best way to kind of stay sane right now -- to sort of have some things like this that are safe and a release from everything. It's mind-numbing.

Two weeks after the administration allowed eateries to resume dine-in services, restaurateurs say more customers were now coming in to eat out.
 As per the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the UT administration, restaurants were allowed to open from June 8 with an 8pm deadline and only 50% capacity to maintain 6 feet distance between customers. Tables have to be sanitised before every new customer, and use of disposable menus and contactless payment has been encouraged.
 Neeraj Bajaj, proprietor of Sindhi Sweets and president of the Chandigarh Business Council, said, "There is about a 30% increase in patrons, but several more were unable to come in due to weekend restrictions in Punjab."
 On the sales' front, he said people were overall definitely spending lesser on the total bill.
 In Sector 10, the dine-in business is thriving as most outlets here have opened now. Annu Bains, proprietor of Brooklyn Central here, said, "The number of customers is gradually going up. We have a loyal clientele that is venturing out more and preferring dine-in over takeaway or home delivery."
 Joint owner of Nik Bakers, Nitin Mittal said, "Once all restaurants reopen, normalcy will be restored. So, it's important for the businesses to stay open."
 The 8pm deadline is however eating into the sales of some restaurants.
 Pal Dhaba in Sector 28 is doing better on home deliveries compared to dine- ins. "People don't venture out in the summer before 8pm. It's impractical to expect customers to visit a dhaba in the searing heat," said proprietor Amit Pal Singh.
 Meanwhile, several restaurants are still not providing dine-in services. "More eateries will open up fully when more customers feel comfortable in stepping out of their houses," said Ankit Gupta, president of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association, and owner of Himani's Vertigo Lounge in Sector 35, where they are offering only home delivery and takeaway for now.
