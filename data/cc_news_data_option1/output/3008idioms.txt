"articleBody": "'Clinical passports' may be the solution in getting fans back to football stadia, the Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters said on Friday. Masters says having defied the sceptics in resuming and bringing the season to a climax -- behind closed doors -- after the hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the next step was to resolve the supporters' conundrum. The 2020/21 Premier League and lower-tier English Football League begin their new seasons on September 12 and Masters said in a column for The Tiimes that every solution was being examined to give fans the chance to watch their team again.

TAUNTON -- A Taunton toddler was rushed to the hospital early Wednesday evening as a result of a call to police about a child drowning in a pool. The nearly 2-year-old boy is still in the hospital but is reported to be breathing on his own as of 8 p.m.
 Taunton police said they were called to a house on Washington Street for the possible drowning just after 5 p.m. Lt. Eric Nichols said the first officer arrived within 60 seconds of the call and initiated medical treatment on the boy.
 Firefighters and emergency services soon arrived and rushed the toddler to Morton Hospital. He was then flown by helicopter to a Boston Hospital.
 Police said detectives are on scene investigating how the child got into the pool.
 "I commend the work of the officers for arriving on scene as quickly as they did, within one minute of the initial call," Taunton Police Chief Edward Walsh said in a press release. "The quick actions of both the police and fire personnel is a testament to their training and ability to act under very stressful circumstances."

The Supreme Court on Friday ordered status quo on bail granted by Delhi High Court to Shivinder Mohan Singh, the former promoter of Fortis Healthcare, in the money laundering case related to Religare Finvest Limited.
 The bench headed by justice Arun Mishra also said that the high court judgment should not be treated as a precedent in other bail matters.
 "Issue notice. In the meantime, the status quo with respect to bail be maintained. The judgment of Delhi high court not to be treated as a precedent," the court said.
 The Delhi high court had, on July 23, granted bail to Singh stating there was no rationale for continuing his custody as an undertrial. The bail was conditional subject to him furnishing a personal bond to the tune of Rs 1 crore and two sureties of Rs 25 lakh.
 He was also directed not to leave the country without the permission of the trial court hearing the case against him.
 Though he was granted bail, Shivinder continues to remain in jail since he is in judicial custody in another case filed by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police.
 Singh was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in December 2019 for offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Before that, EOW had arrested him in October 2019 for offences under Indian Penal Code.
 The trial court had rejected his bail plea in June.
 The Supreme Court will also consider the important question of whether the twin conditions for granting of bail under section 45 continues to remain valid. Section 45 was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2017.
 The section was subsequently amended by Parliament. However, Delhi high court had held in a case of Upendra Rai vs ED that the twin conditions for bail under section 45 will not stand revived despite the amendment made to it.
 This high court order was, subsequently, stayed by the Supreme Court.
 In Shivinder's bail plea, Delhi high court observed that although there has been an amendment to section 45, there is no subsequent decision of the Supreme Court holding the said two conditions to be constitutionally valid, even when brought back by way of the amendment. Accordingly, it must treat the said two conditions as invalid and struck-down.
 This aspect has been challenged by ED before SC. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that the Supreme Court must examine this issue and settle the law conclusively.
 "We will have to settle the law. The solicitor general has made the correct submission by SG," justice Mishra said.

LONDON (AP) — Britain’s health secretary defended the government’s abrupt re-imposition of restrictions on social life across a swath of northern England on Friday, saying it was important to clamp down quickly on new outbreaks of COVID-19. Matt Hancock said that while it’s not the “sort of decision that anybody would want to take,’’ the government had no choice. “It is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you’ve got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it,” he told Sky News. Under the new restrictions, people from different households in Greater Manchester, England’s second largest metropolitan area, have been asked to not meet indoors. The order also applies to the surrounding areas of Lancashire and West Yorkshire counties, affecting more than 4 million people in all. Hancock said data showed the coronavirus was being spread primarily between households. He told the BBC that “one of the terrible things about this virus is it thrives on the sort of social contact that makes life worth living.” Opposition politicians supported the latest move but criticized the government for announcing the restrictions in a tweet from Hancock late Thursday, just two hours before they came into force at midnight. Labour Party business spokeswoman Lucy Powell said the “bolt out of the blue” approach was “not the way to build confidence and to take people with you and maximize compliance with these steps.” The affected region has a large Muslim population, and the restrictions coincide with the Eid al-Adha holiday, where many people would normally gather in each other’s homes. Hancock said “my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are.” . ..

Taking note of a Dalit saint's complaint, BSP chief Mayawati on Friday said it would have been better if the saint from the oppressed community had also been invited along with the 200 priests that will attend the mega Rample temple bhoomi pujan (ground-breaking ceremony) on August 5.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend the big event for which Diwali-like preparations are in full swing.
 Mayawati, in a series of tweets, said the invitation to Swami Kanhaiya Prabhunandan Giri would have made a positive impact and would have been in line with the Constitutional design of creating a casteless society.
 However, the BSP chief also advised the community to not fall into this trap and work for their upliftment.
 "Instead of getting into these debates, the Dalit society suffering from casteist neglect, contempt and injustice should focus more on labour/deeds for their salvation. In this case also, they should follow the path of their Messiah Param Pujya Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar. This is the advice of the BSP," said Mayawati.
 Swami Kanhaiya Prabhunandan Giri, lone Dalit Mahamanadaleshwar of Juna Akhada, on Thursday had expressed discontent after the organisers - Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust - did not extend him the invitation for the ground-breaking ceremony of the Ram temple to be constructed at the site of the Babri Masjid, which was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992.
 The saints belonging to the upper caste groups have been invited, he said, alleging that he was ignored for being a Dalit.
 The Dalits are being ignored in the Ram temple construction, he alleged, could be gauged from the fact that no Dalit has been made a member in the Trust constituted to supervise the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya.
 In Ramayana it is clearly mentioned that Rama worked for the uplift and welfare of the downtrodden and oppressed community, the saint underscored.
 Giri, a native of Azamgarh, was made Mahamanadaleshwar in a programme organised at Prayagraj during the 2019 Kumbh. He is the sole Mahamanadaleshwar from the Dalit community in the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad - the top body that controls the activities of all the akharas in the country.
 Dismissing Giri's accusation, the chief of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, Mahant Narendra Giri, said: "When a person becomes a sadhu he loses the caste identity, all the sadhus are equal in the Akhara Parishad."
 HT's attempts to reach out to the Trust's local office in Ayodhya elicited no response.

"We are also willing to see how we can support the development of 'clinical passports' \-- an app-based system that looks at all symptoms and other COVID-19 contributing factors -- as well as other measures," he wrote.Masters said the Premier League was seeking to work with local councils on transport solutions."We are considering all areas of a match day, from ticketing solutions, stadium seating allocation configuration and timed entries, to temperature checks and an in-seat food and drink service for fans," said Masters."We will work with local authorities and clubs to seek solutions to local transport challenges such as introducing additional car parking and secure bicycle spaces and implementing park-and-walk schemes."Masters said bringing fans back was vital not only for their teams on the pitch but for a variety of reasons off it too."The importance of fans is not only related to the match-day experience and team performance," he said."Without them, there is also a significant financial impact on clubs at all levels of the game, and their cities, towns and communities."Masters, though, urged patience as the solutions will not be found quickly."There is still a lot to be done, and it will not happen overnight," he said."We must test and prove what is possible, in tandem with the authorities, within a framework that is flexible and can adapt to fast-moving circumstances and developing expertise."A number of sports events have been held with a limited number of fans in England in the last few days.The Oval welcomed one thousand cricket spectators last Sunday, snooker's world championship will have several hundred spectators in the indoor arena when it begins on Friday and the Glorious Goodwood racing Festival reaches a climax on Saturday with 4,000 spectators permitted.",

REIMS, France (AP) — Champagne is losing its fizz. For months, lockdown put the cork on weddings, dining out, parties and international travel — all key sales components for the French luxury wine marketed for decades as a sparkling must at any celebration. Producers in France's eastern Champagne region, headquarters of the global industry, say they've lost an estimated 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in sales for this year, as turnover fell by a third — a hammering unmatched in living memory, and worse than the Great Depression. They expect about 100 million bottles to be languishing unsold in their cellars by the end of the year. “We are experiencing a crisis that we evaluate to be even worse than the Great Depression” of 1929, said Thibaut Le Mailloux of the Champagne Committee, known by its French acronym CIVC, that represents some 16,000 winemakers. Recognizing the urgency of the problem, the CIVC is launching unprecedented damage-limitation measures. Like oil-producing countries, the committee regulates the size of the harvest each year to avoid the kind of excess production that would cause bottle prices to plummet. At a meeting scheduled for Aug. 18, it's expected to impose a cap so tight that record quantities of grapes will be destroyed or sold to distilleries at discounted prices. The prospect alarms smaller producers, who are more vulnerable than the big houses. Anselme Selosse, of Jacques Selosse Champagnes, called it “an insult to nature\" that champagne's famous grapes might even be destined to produce alcohol for hand sanitizer, as is happening in other wine-producing regions such as Alsace after demand spiked during the pandemic. “We are to destroy (the grapes) and we pay for them to be destroyed,” Selosse said, referring to the industry as a whole. “It’s nothing but a...
