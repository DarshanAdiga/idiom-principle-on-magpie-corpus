Newsom also outlined a series of steps aimed at providing more space for hospital patients.
 He said the state has taken over a 357-bed bankrupt hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area, soon will announce the purchase of a similarly sized hospital in Southern California and may use dormitories at the state’s public colleges and universities. He also asked Trump to dock the Navy’s 1,000-patient Mercy hospital ship in the Port of Los Angeles.
 The coronavirus is spread through sneezes and coughs. There are at least 1,030 confirmed cases in California and 18 people have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 Newsom’s statewide order came after counties and communities covering about half the state’s population already had issued similar edicts. He said the restriction is “open-ended” because it could raise false hopes if he included an end date.
 However, he did offer a glimmer by saying he didn’t expect it would last “many, many months.”
 Just before Newsom’s statewide declaration, Los Angeles announced what officials there called a “Safer at Home” order that carried the same restrictions.
 “We’re about to enter into a new way of living here in Los Angeles,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said. “What we do and how we do it and if we get this right will determine how long this crisis lasts.”
 In the letter to Trump seeking the hospital ship, Newsom said California’s infection rates are doubling every four days in some areas and that 56% of the state’s population could contract the virus in the next eight weeks, which would be more than 22 million people. He later said the “overwhelming majority won’t have symptoms” and will be fine but that up to 20% could be hospitalized.

Chris Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, said Friday that it’s true that productivity for California businesses will be down, but that it doesn’t necessarily mean a long-run hit to profits. In his mind, there is a glass half full outlook for business leaders.
 “These aren’t job losses, these are job furloughs,” Thornberg said. “There is an enormous difference.”
 And the economic fallout from the coronavirus won’t be as catastrophic as, say, the Great Recession, which destroyed the entire housing industry.
 “That was an enormous shift in the structure of the economy,” he said. “In three months, we’re going to have the exact same economy we had two weeks ago.”
 So what about all the small businesses, especially restaurants, that have to close? Thornberg said they have already reduced labor and food costs significantly so that needs to be factored in. Although things could change as the crisis worsens, he’s hopeful that the fundamentals of the economy are strong enough to keep most afloat.
 But Powell, the bookstore owner, said small businesses have more to fear than larger corporations.
 “The big question is, how long can you afford to have your business go with no income?” she said. “Some businesses have more padding than others.”
 Once a small business suffers a financial flatline — and empties its coffers to remain alive — then it becomes more susceptible to catastrophe in the future.
 “When you’re on thin ice, all it takes is a little nudge in the wrong direction to make you go under,” Powell said. “We’re hoping we can weather the storm.”

Regardless of sexual abuse being a considerably volatile/sensitive topic, the phrase 'knowledge is power' generally springs to mind. The prominence and visibility of the #MeToo movement has encouraged countless numbers of celebrities and the general public to address the sexual abuse issue of today, shining a light on just how many people it affects, especially within the film industry. Furthermore, the power of word of mouth encourages people’s awareness and channels the fire for moral and legal justice, as seen particularly regarding Weinstein and Cosby. Moreover, the unveiled global sexual abuse victims highlight the pain endured and implicated by men in positions of power, but such unification reiterates that one man’s creative genius should not and is not an excuse for sexual abuse unaccountability and lack of justice being served. While we cannot remedy victims’ pain, our challenges and protests could help lessen the suffering and stigma. Hopefully preventing more men and women from enduring this very same abuse in the future.

Coronavirus has turned the entire world upside down but Richard London is offering a guide to get through it.
 “People are just getting stressed out all over the place with the uncertainty of what's going on,” said London, the author of "A Handbook for Happiness.”
 He is a cancer survivor and is living with Parkinson’s disease. He wrote the guide in 2013 but thinks people could benefit from it now more than ever.
 “This will help them put things in perspective," London said. "Understanding where things are at right now, dealing with what they can control and not control, understanding that as bad as things look, they really have things to be thankful for in their lives and they'll get over it, we will get past this."
 In the book, he writes happiness is a decision. It lays out steps on how to achieve that.
 “Giving gratitude for what we have," London said. "Yes, right now we are focused on what we can't do and what we don’t have but with so many blessings in our lives, let’s not forget those."
 One of those blessings can be people like him thinking of ways to help their neighbors and community members through this pandemic.
 “The more people that will download the book and be able to help, the happier I’ll be,” he said.

 Other agents said they would continue with the social distancing practices already implemented. Bonnie Phelps, of Palomar Mountain Real Estate, said she already doesn’t do open houses and is now also trying to maintain distance between clients.

 “We were laughing and talking, but we were keeping our distance,” Phelps said of showing the $75,000 cabin.

The report that Clowney may have turned down $17 million -- assuming it's accurate -- would also be telling in illustrating what it is that Clowney has been seeking, and may still want.
 The report of the Miami offer came from Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle, who stated the Dolphins "discussed $17 million annual average deal at one point in process with Seahawks free agent Jadeveon Clowney, per sources. Didn't accept, so Dolphins moved on with Shaq Lawson. Clowney aiming for $20 million average, but could wind up signing for less on shorter deal.''
 The Miami aspect of that report was rebutted by Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald who tweeted that an "involved party'' stated "there was no Dolphins offer for Clowney.''
 The most telling part could be the report that Clowney is "aiming for $20 million'' average.
 By all accounts he's nowhere close to getting that from Seattle.

 If so, Clowney may be setting his sights on a short-term deal that would allow him to hit free agency again in a year or two when the salary cap will rise, and he won't have to deal with the current travel restrictions which means he can't make visits to team facilities for physicals. Clowney's health -- he had surgery in January to repair a core muscle injury -- is thought one of the reasons he has not gotten offers in his hoped-for $20 million range.

The Trump administration will appoint Victoria Coates as special energy representative to Saudi Arabia as Washington struggles to deal with a global oil price crash dragging on the economy and threatening U.S. energy producers, an Energy Department official said on Monday.
 Coates, who was one of President Donald Trump's longest-serving security aides, moved from the White House in February to become a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
 "Coates will be based in Saudi Arabia to ensure the Department of Energy has an added presence in the region," the official said. "While her assignment comes at a pivotal time for global oil markets, it has been in the works for a while."
 Coates' start date is unknown due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has said he wants to find a medium ground regarding the oil price crash. Earlier in March, he tweeted that low gasoline prices were good for drivers.
 Last week, as anemic oil prices threatened domestic drillers with bankruptcy, he told reporters at the White House he would get involved in the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia "at the appropriate time."
 Oil prices have dropped by more than half in the last two weeks as Saudi Arabia and Russia launched a price war and the coronavirus pandemic destroyed demand. U.S. crude oil edged higher in after-hours trading on Monday to nearly $24 a barrel, after tumbling 29% last week in its steepest slide since the outset of the U.S.-Iraq Gulf War in 1991.
 Coates, who was Senator Ted Cruz's national security adviser for four years and was a foreign policy adviser to then-Texas Governor Rick Perry, joined the Trump White House from its beginnings. She is also an art historian.
 She was deputy national security adviser for Trump, and specialized on the Middle East, particularly Iran.
 Coates will work in the kingdom for months at least alongside State Department officials and an existing energy attache, Scott Hutchins.
 On Monday, Brouillette said the Trump administration would soon make a diplomatic push on stabilizing energy markets.
 He told Bloomberg TV that a U.S.-Saudi oil alliance was one of "many, many ideas" that had been discussed, but no decisions have been made on "anything of that nature."

The mayors of the state’s two largest cities asked Gov. Chris Sununu Monday to issue a stay-at-home order to slow the spread of COVID-19, joining a growing number of public officials and business executives asking the governor to do so.
 In a joint statement, Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig and Nashua Mayor Jim Donchess urged Sununu to tell all Granite Staters — with the exception of first responders and workers providing essential services — to stay home to prevent further transmission of the virus.
 The statement was issued just ahead of a Monday COVID-19 briefing, in which state officials announced the number of cases in the Granite State now top 100, along with the first confirmed death from coronavirus in New Hampshire.
 “I understand this isn’t an easy decision, and this is an unprecedented situation we now find ourselves in,” Craig said in a statement. “However, I believe this move is necessary to keep Granite Staters safe. The sooner everyone stays home, avoids unnecessary travel and non-essential activities, the better chance we have to flatten the curve and save lives.”
 “We are making this request based upon the advice of our local medical experts and our public health department,” Donchess said in the statement. “For the health of the people in our community, we need to require work from home for non-essential employees, and we need to take all other reasonable precautions, to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Medical experts predict that if people are not physically separated, we may see hundreds of people sick and needing hospitalization — more than the available hospital beds — at the same time right in our community. We are seeking to do everything we can to reduce the likelihood of this possibility and to save lives.”
 Craig said she was saddened to learn of the first COVID-19 death in the Granite State.
 “My heart goes out to his family during this difficult time,” Craig said in a statement. “COVID-19 activity is increasing throughout the state. This pandemic is a silent threat — it spreads before you even know you’ve caught it. It’s upon all of us to do our part to take the necessary precautions to avoid community spread.”
 On Monday, Sununu said he was limiting all gatherings to no more than 10 people, in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He urged New Hampshire residents to stay home whenever possible, and continue practicing social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.
 The governor said anyone over 60 and people with underlying medical conditions should stay at home. Sununu said additional measures might be necessary in the future, but stopped short of announcing any new restrictions.
 Mike Skelton, president and CEO of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said he believes the local business community recognizes that “the sooner we get a handle on this dangerous disease, the sooner we can get back to ‘business as usual’ and stabilize the economy.”
 “We’ve encouraged our members to follow CDC and public health employer guidelines since the onset of this issue,” said Skelton. “I think most businesses have done so and adapted the operations to best extent possible, whether that includes implementing remote work-from-home polices or social distancing in the workplace, ensuring sick employees stay home, reducing operations, or temporary closure.”
 Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and state health officials issued a stay-at- home advisory effective until Tuesday, April 7. Baker also ordered the closure of non-essential businesses, starting Tuesday.
 Examples of essential organizations and employees include health care, law enforcement, food manufacturers, grocers, utilities, transportation and public works.
 Baker drew a distinction between his orders and a mandated shelter-in-place, saying he did not believe that he “can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their homes for days on end.”
 Monday also marked the first day of Baker’s ordered closure of all child care facilities, with exemptions for about 300 facilities serving the families of emergency personnel, medical staff and workers deemed critical to fighting the COVID-19 outbreak.
 In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan issued a new executive order effective Monday that closes all nonessential businesses, organizations, establishments and facilities in the state.
 “Let me be clear, we are not issuing or ordering a shelter in place directive or forcing people to stay home,” Hogan said in a statement.

TOKYO -- The dollar eased on Tuesday but remained near a three-year high against a basket of currencies as investors sought the world's main funding and settlement currency ahead of a sharp anticipated fall in cashflow.
 Market reaction was mixed to the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary array of programs, its third emergency move this month.
 The dollar index stood at 102.14, having dipped 0.3% on Monday but still not far from Friday's peak of 102.99, its highest level since January 2017.
 Against the yen, the dollar traded at 110.95 yen, having hit a one-month high of 111.59.
 The euro ticked up to $1.0752 after touching a near three-year low of $1.0636 in the previous session.
 The British pound stood at $1.1548, up 0.3% in early trade though it remained near its 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week.
 "The market is still nervous about possible moves to cash everything, including unwinding of existing derivative positions," said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.
 The Fed announced unlimited quantitative easing and programs to support credit markets on Monday in a drastic bid to backstop an economy reeling from emergency restrictions on commerce.
 The program includes purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business.
 While the move is likely to mitigate the blow for many companies in the long- run, investors remained on edge amid uncertainty about the extent of the pandemic.
 Wall Street's slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown while Washington's fiscal stimulus package remained stalled in the Senate.
 Trading remained volatile, with the Australian dollar rising 0.75% to $0.5873, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 touched last week.

A groundswell that began Friday when USA Swimming became the first national governing body in the United States to request a postponement has rapidly grown into a tidal wave. Though the International Olympic Committee indicated it will wait four weeks before making a decision, IOC member Craig Reedie told The Associated Press on Monday that pushing the games back is likely.
 Leung said her organization would not specify how long of a delay it is requesting but added that most respondents were OK with holding the games in 2021. She said those who wanted the games to go forward as scheduled were concerned about whether their bodies could withstand another year of training. Some respondents also worried about whether they could absorb the cost of extending their elite careers an additional 12 months.
 Asked what recourse USA Gymnastics might have to financially assist athletes if the Olympic cycle is extended a year, Leung said, “We are in the process of trying to figure out if we are able to support these athletes going forward.”
 If the games are postponed, the 2020 Olympic trials — scheduled for June 25-28 in St. Louis — would also be pushed back. Leung said the organization still hopes to hold a national championship at some point this year. The event is currently scheduled for June 4-7 in Fort Worth, Texas.
 Two-time world championship team member and 2017 national champion Yul Moldauer told the AP that he was among those who would like to see the games delayed. Moldauer, who typically trains at the University of Oklahoma, has been working out at a gym run by two-time Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner in Norman, Oklahoma, because the university is closed.
 While the workouts have been productive, he said, the change in venue and the equipment his training group uses has disrupted their routines, with no timetable on when things might get back to normal.

ONE Northern Rivers personal trainer has started an initiative to help keep Australians, who are self-isolating, connected, fit and positive despite the current climate around coronavirus (COVID-19)
 Bod Squad owner Rikki-lee Petrie knew there was something profound about the crisis before cases had started to multiply in Australia.
 She watched her class fall by half in Byron Bay, Brunswick Heads, Lennox Head, Alstonville and Ballina last week as news of the virus in Australia became widespread.
 “And across the board we had women who were too scared to go outside, too scared to share gym equipment, and too anxious to go social boxing class.
 “I saw all this panic across the people who I really care for and really love.”
 So in response she started an online platform on Facebook for people to be able to get the great exercise burn and endorphin rush without having to put themselves in a situation they didn’t feel comfortable.
 She had a 1000 people join in 24 hours.
 “Basically, what I did straight away as soon as virus hit, even before it was in Australia, was talk to members in terms of social isolation,” Ms Petrie said.
 Initially members would send her a text and she would send out the workout to members.
 “As soon I started that I had 10- 20 texts messages every morning before 5am,” she said.
 She evolved it into the free Facebook Group ‘Bod Squad Keeps Australia Moving’ which is free to join and hosts a variety of videos that use body weight exercises and are done in high intensity and low intensity version so anybody can do it including men, women, and children.
 Videos are filmed in different locations each time including a farm with horses, or the beach.
 “When we started it, I thought of making it just for Bod Squad people, but then I thought why would we do it just for us,” she said.
 “If I could make anyone feel better, why not open it to our community?
 “And then I thought why not open it up to Australia?”
 She said she hoped that members would share it further than the Northern Rivers and hoped it could set an example in keeping Australia healthy in social isolation.

This self- tarnishing leaves many unsympathetic, given it being of his own accord due to him drugging and rape of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey. Initially meant to receive a 90-day prison time before his final sentencing, Polanski appealed and was rewarded a 90-day probationary period in order to finish his current work. Arguably, and quite justifiably, this begs to question the acts of the legal profession, apparently prioritising art over the justice of a vulnerable victim - begging to question whether any one person’s art is worth more than their sexual abuse.   Effectively due to his high status within the film industry, as well as his French- Polish nationality, he retreated to France and has never been held accountable for the crimes in which he confessed. Although Polanski has never returned to the global film hub of Hollywood, his career’s seemingly _still_ flourishing following his win at the Cesars Awards.

 “One hundred percent of funds raised will be given to those who work in the service industry in the Wood River Valley,” Cullen said.
 Cullen stressed the valley’s dependence upon its service industry. As a tourist destination, the Wood River’s economic backbone is largely formed by its servers. Unemployment benefits for the service industry comes in dramatically below par because it does not account for tips, which constitute a large portion of any server’s income.

Trump acknowledged there were trade-offs, “there's no question about that," but claimed that, if closures stretch on for months, there would be “probably more death from that than anything that we're talking about with respect to the virus.”
 The comments were further evidence that Trump has grown impatient with the pandemic, even before it has reached its expected peak. In recent days, tensions have been rising between those who argue the country needs to get back up and running to prevent a deep economic depression and medical experts who warn that, unless more extreme action is taken, the human cost will be catastrophic.

Charlottesville adjusted its plans for meal delivery last week, adding the five bus routes. This week, the division is allowing students to take home multiple days’ worth of food. An adult doesn’t need to be present for a child to receive a meal.
 Charlottesville’s current bus routes are listed at charlottesvilleschools.org/food.
 Schools are providing meals through federal school lunch programs and have to follow federal requirements to receive reimbursement.
 The Legal Aid Justice Center is encouraging school districts to think outside the box when it comes to expanding access to meal programs.
 “Make sure you are giving food to people who need it,” said Mario Salas, at attorney with the center’s JustChildren Program.
 Sales said Legal Aid has been talking with the Virginia Department of Education about its guidance to school systems on meals programs.
 “The message is to distribute the food and worry about access first and reimbursement later,” Sales said.
 Last week, VDOE’s Office of School Nutrition Programs released a set of recommended best practices such as adjusting meal service times to meet students’ needs and delivering meals directly to families.
