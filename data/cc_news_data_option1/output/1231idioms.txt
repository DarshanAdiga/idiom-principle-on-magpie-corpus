Today, Howard County issued another order relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, this time restricting what stores can sell during the outbreak.
 The Howard County Board of Commissioners signed an ordinance placing restrictions on the sale of certain goods that were deemed nonessential. Those restrictions were put into place after an outcry from the business community, wherein businesses that were shuttered in response to COVID-19 complained that the businesses left open to sell essential goods still were selling nonessential items.
 This, according to the ordinance, also allowed shoppers to needlessly congregate in stores. According to Howard County Commissioner Paul Wyman, the goal of the ordinance was to encourage individuals to stay home if going into public isn’t necessary. The new ordinance, he said, hopefully would cut down the chances of COVID-19 being transmitted.

Diciamo che nel giro di una settimana siamo passati da una decina di volontari a quasi cinquanta e questo a testimonianza dell’attenzione che le giovani generazioni della nostra città riversano verso gli altri. Ecco, è questo il dato che, in questa fase, ci preme sottolineare e che ci fornisce grande speranza per il futuro. Si è creata una notevole catena solidale che ci permette di fornire un nostro piccolo aiuto in un periodo così critico in cui tutti si sentono in difficoltà anche nella gestione delle più semplici necessità quotidiane”. Il numero da chiamare per richiedere l’intervento dei volontari è 0932.1847249. “E’ una bella sfida – continua Chiavola – quella che questo gruppo di persone si è intestata. E ringrazio tutti, a cominciare da Michele Savarese, altro perno della nostra associazione, ma anche Enzo Criscione, presidente dell’Associazione nazionale paracadutisti, sezione di Ragusa, per l’attenzione che ci permette di guardare avanti con rinnovata fiducia sui percorsi di solidarietà che, ne siamo certi, saranno ancora più concreti e necessari dopo che questa tempesta sarà passata”.
