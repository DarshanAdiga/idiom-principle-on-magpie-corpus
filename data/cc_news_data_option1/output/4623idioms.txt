CRIMINAL ACTIONS
 State v. John Bradish; Bradish pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol – his 4th or subsequent charge in 10 years, and interference with a peace officer. Misdemeanors for breach of peace, battery, criminal trespassing will be dealt with at his sentencing. Bradish is accused of driving a Polaris Razor to a residence he was not supposed to be at while intoxicated in March. While there, he is accused of punching his brother and resisting arrest from officers. Bradish’s request made on Monday to leave the VA campus was denied and he can only petition the court for this again if he finds potential employment where the employer agrees to notify the VA and the court of any non-compliance of the VA protocols or Bradish’s bond conditions.
 State v. Nicholas Balderas; Balderas’ felony charge was reduced to reckless endangering, which he pleaded guilty to. He was sentenced to 1 year unsupervised probation, a 170 day suspended jail sentence, and $685 in court fees. Balderas must pay back his debt at a rate of $75 per month. He was accused of hitting his son with his hand, leaving an extremely visible handprint on his back in June.

In fact, a new report indicates that Johnny Depp had only filmed one scene prior to his exit. Those in the know may understand why, as THR revealed the reason Warner Bros. has to pay Depp his full due after leaving _Fantastic Beasts 3_ is due to a classic “Pay or Play” contract saying the studio must. Just as the name implies, should a star be committed to a project with this famous clause in play, whether the film happens or they get fired, they still get paid. So with one scene in the can, Johnny Depp will have gotten an entire paycheck out of the deal.

By unlocking this vital resource, a significant lever would be created to support the technological shift towards greener logistics. Ample solutions already exist, such as sustainable fuel, fleet renewal, engine retrofitting, and efficiency projects. These investments would not only be a highly efficient way to decarbonize the transport sector, but also result in structural improvements of the entire logistics supply chain in the long run.

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Michael Tlusty, University of Massachusetts Boston (THE CONVERSATION) Eating fish can provide powerful advantages for the heart and brain, yet Americans eat less than half of the 26 pounds per year that experts recommend. By contrast, Americans buy seven times more chicken and beef annually than fish. Why Americans don’t eat more fish has been pondered for a long time by health experts, fish farmers and fishermen themselves. One way to consider this question is production. Consumers can buy a product only if it’s available. The more they buy, theoretically, the more that item will be produced. In this case, a greater demand for fish would be stimulated if more fish were offered for sale. More seafood could be made available for American consumers from global ocean sources given that at least 60% of seafood in the U.S. is imported. U.S. aquaculture has the capacity to significantly increase. Research conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries also indicates slightly more domestic wild-caught fish can be harvested. Why eat fish? Rich in lean protein and long chain omega-3 fatty acids, fish provides robust nutritional benefits that can help ward off chronic disease, boost immunity and reduce inflammation in the body. Seafood provides your body with critical omega-3 fats and minerals, like selenium, zinc, iron and iodine. It also provides vitamins B12 and D that fend off heart disease, among other benefits. Fish provides such positive benefits for the body that recent USDA Dietary Guidelines offer guidance specific to pregnant women and children based on the finding that seafood consumption leads to cognitive improvement in...

BERLIN (AP) — The German government's tax income this year is expected to be a bit higher than previously forecast after the economy, Europe's biggest, performed relatively well in the third quarter. An updated forecast by tax experts for the government released Thursday predicted a tax take of 728.3 billion euros ($859 billion) this year, up from the 717.7 billion euros they expected in September. Next year's outlook improved to 776.2 billion euros from 772.9 billion euros. The German economy grew by 8.2% in the third quarter compared with the previous three-month period, when it was hit hard by the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic. The government is predicting that, over the full year, it will shrink by 5.5%. The full-year forecast has become progressively less pessimistic, despite a resurgence of virus cases in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. German authorities last week launched a four-week partial shutdown in an effort to push down infections, shutting restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities, but leaving schools and nonessential shops open. The government initially said it would spend up to 10 billion euros to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown for revenue they miss out on. On Thursday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said that “it will certainly be more than the 10 billion we have been discussing so far, and I think that's completely OK because we are able to do it and we should do it so that we can maintain the good economic data we have today.” He didn't give a specific figure but said “it could be a few billion more,\" depending on demand. After six years in the black, Germany is borrowing a net 217.8 billion euros this year to finance rescue and stimulus packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue. Next year, it plans to borrow a further 96.2 billion euros.

Nearly 100 years later Bill Ruger caught the fever and introduced a semi- automatic carbine (named the deerslayer if memory serves) chambered for the .44 magnum round. The carbine resembled the older M1 World War II-era carbines but only had a four-round magazine. We were still living in Montana when I bought one for Sandi to use, but she said it kicked too much, so we sent it down the road.
 Don’t remember what I traded it for, but, like several other trades, that’s one I still regret. That little carbine was accurate, powerful and handy. I was never able to shoot a deer with it, but it put many a coon or porcupine on our table. When that big slug hit them, they were DRT (Dead Right There).
 Years ago, like 150 years ago, Winchester understood the value of chambering its rifles in the same calibers as Colt was making revolvers, like the .44-40 and the .38-40 and the .32-20. For travelers in the backcountry, which was sparsely populated at the time, the ability to carry one cartridge for both your long gun and hand gun was considered a valuable asset.
 So to, when the big magnums came into prominence, did many enlightened woods loafers decide that using the same cartridge in both a carbine and a handgun would be ideal for their use. Most, however, disdained anything like a semi- auto, preferring the short, handy lever-action carbines. Early on, gunsmiths were successfully converting model 92 Winchesters to the .357 round. When the .44 magnum was introduced, many remaining mdl. 92s were converted.
 The problem was the bigger .44 was less of a fit in the old carbines and rifles and, due to age, wear, inexact metallurgy in the older, original long guns and perhaps injudiciously overloaded cartridges, many excellent examples of those older original firearms were physically destroyed. Unfortunately, simply converting them to a modern cartridge effectively destroyed any collector value they might have eventually gained.
 However, American manufacturing acumen, ever on the alert to make a dollar, stepped in with new clones of the older guns, purpose built for the much more powerful cartridges. Ironically, that trend was started, I believe, by the Brazilian firm of Rossi and, when those offerings took off, then the American gun producers stepped up their game and started offering similar products.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union said Thursday that it is prolonging sanctions against dozens of Venezuelan officials for another year over allegations that they are undermining democracy in the crisis-wracked country or are linked to rights abuses there. The move means that travel bans and asset freezes against 36 people will remain in place until Nov. 14, 2021. The EU has also imposed an arms embargo on Venezuela and outlawed the supply of equipment that could be used in any crackdown on civilians. “The decision was taken in light of the ongoing political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, with persistent actions undermining democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights,” EU headquarters said in a statement. It said the measures are targeted at officials in the regime of President Nicolás Maduro and not meant to harm the Venezuelan people. Once a wealthy oil nation, Venezuela is mired in a deep economic crisis, which critics blame on two decades of failed socialist policies that have left the nation bankrupt and its infrastructure crumbling. Maduro says he is under attack from Washington, which wants to oust him from power. The EU and Washington back opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who claimed presidential powers in early 2019 as head of the National Assembly. A coalition of more than 50 nations recognize him, saying Maduro clings to power after an undemocratic election.

Complying with that request, a new recasting bid is in the works, and the third _Fantastic Beasts_ film, already in production, is going to have to have some reshoots to do. Or rather, the cast and crew will have _a_ reshoot on its docket, as Johnny Depp leaves the film with a full salary after having filmed very little for the latest installment.
