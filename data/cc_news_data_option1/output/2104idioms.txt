JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The protest at the State Capitol looked much different than some of the images we’ve seen from Minneapolis and other parts of the country. It was peaceful.What happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis transcends any headlines for many of those who rallied outside the Mississippi State Capitol.“We are actually fighting for our lives every single day," said Michael Barber. "I have to get up and make sure what I put on...I have to know is it too dark? Is it too bright? You know, the other night I actually had to hold my girlfriend as she cried because she was scared for me to leave the house because of what’s going on.”Michael Barber says he can only hope his children won’t have those same experiences. That’s another reason he didn’t want to sit on the sidelines and not speak out against racism and police brutality.“I’m lucky I turned 22," noted Barber. "In the black community, it is a blessing to turn 21. When we reach 25, that is a milestone, not graduating college, not getting your license or anything... turning an age is a milestone. It’s not even really a tradition in our culture.”“We the people demand the death of racism and the rebirth of liberty,” said one protester through a bullhorn.Others echoed the idea that Mississippi’s history makes peaceful protests like this imperative.“Racism has been a big part of Mississippi’s history for a very long time," noted D.E. Turner. "I think it was very important for us to be here today and to put Mississippi into the fight for justice and liberty for its people.”The group did march through downtown Jackson after leaving the State Capitol. When asked about the protests, Governor Tate Reeves said this.“I fully support everyone’s individual right to protest their government, to protest government decisions, as long as they do so in a peaceful manner," explained Reeves. "That is a constitutional right. That is one of the very foundations of our country.”Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

Cancer is brutal. Period. End of sentence. And also true, brain cancer is brutal in a way that is unique to any other cancer or disease. Brain cancer is a heartbreaking reminder that the mind-body connection isn’t some mythical, magical concept discussed in yoga classes around the world. A diagnosis of brain cancer forces you to come to terms with the fact that the parts of you that you thought were untouchable by disease—your sarcastic sense of humor, your love of spicy food and sunny days, your unique, intangible you-ness, are in fact vulnerable to something tangible. That the hard-to-define spark in the person you love most in the world is created by an organ—and when that organ is attacked, that spark fades, that person ceases, even when they are still standing right in front of you.

Amaravati (Andhra Pradesh) [India], May 29 (ANI): Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that the state is doing well in containing COVID-19 as compared to the national average.   Stating that Andhra Pradesh government has taken long prance to bring quality medicare within the reach of poor and has built infrastructure from rural level upwards, Jagan Mohn Reddy said the State has been doing exceptionally well in containing COVID-19 vis-a-vis national average.   "The rural health care will take a big leap with the setting up of YSR Clinics in every village, and creating 9,712 jobs from doctors to nurses and paramedics with IPHS (Indian Public Health Standards) guidelines besides flagging off a fleet of 1,060 104 and 108 ambulance vehicles on July 1 which are some of the measures we are adding up to the healthcare system," Jagan Mohan Reddy said during the Brainstorming session (Our Governance Your Suggestion) on Medical and Health here today.   "On the COVID-19 front our State has fared well. With just two testing labs, in 70 days, we have increased the strength to 13 labs taking the number of tests per day from 10,000 to 11,000. The total tests taken so far account for 3.42 lakh as of now and we are better than the national average in terms of positive cases, recovery rate and causality rate," he said.   "We have five dedicated COVID hospitals and in districts 65 hospitals dedicated for Corona patients. We have 38,000 isolation beds, 15,000 equipped with oxygen supply, 5,400 ICU beds of which 1,350 have ventilator facility. About 24,000 doctors and 22,500 paramedical staff are working," the chief minister said adding "We have to accept that we have to live with Corona as it is not going to exit early and as it can come to anybody, we should not attach stigma to it."   The Chief Minister said, "During my padayatra, many people have complained about the poor health facilities and how Aarogyasri scheme was being watered down and how healthcare has been pushing people into debts. Aarogyasri is made available to people with an income of less than Rs five lakh per annum benefiting 1.42 crore people and covering over 2,000 ailments, including cancer and cochlear implant for deaf and dumb. The facility was extended to 132 super-speciality hospitals in Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru."   He said, "The previous government has not cleared medical dues of Rs 686 cores and we have cleared them and made everything up to date. The medicines being supplied in Government hospitals are of WHO and GMP standards while during previous government we have seen rats eating away newly born babies and surgeries being carried out by cell phone lights."   "We have graded the hospitals and asked them to improve the infrastructure to reach the higher grade as their bills are being paid on time. YSR Aarogya Asara provides Rs 5,000 per month pension for a period one is advised to undergo rest by doctor post-surgery under YSR Aarogyasri."   For people suffering with chronic ailments, pension is being paid ranging from Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000 and the amount is being door delivered by village volunteers.   "We are also issuing YSR Aarogya Card with QR coding, which has the medical history of the patient, who need not take his full reports every time he visits the doctor. Of the 1.42 lakh eligible people we have distributed 1.33 lakh cards and the rest will be given in two weeks' time," the chief minister said.   "Under YSR Kanti Velugu was started with a budget of about Rs 560 cores. About 70 lakh students were screened for visual impairment and spectacles were supplied to 1.29 lakh students. Surgeries would be done to 46,000 students in the coming days. In the next phase screening would be done to old people and physically challenged persons," he said.   Jagan Mohan Reddy said, "Nadu Nedu is the other revolutionary step we have taken up to revamp, the hospitals in the coming three years. The State will have 16 new teaching hospitals along with seven super specialty hospitals in tribal areas. Rs 16,000 crores would be spent on public health. The YSR Village Clinics will function round the clock."   "YSR Telemedicine is the new initiative under which if a patient gives a missed call to 14410 the doctor will come on line and give the prescription. The medicines will be door delivered," he added.

The oil market could stay in a state of contango for longer after supply and demand finally balance due to the vast amount of crude and products in storage, Reuters reported on Friday, citing analysts and investment banks. Contango is the state of the market in which prices for delivery at later dates are higher than prompt prices--a market situation signaling oversupply and one which traders use to store oil for delivery at a later date. The opposite market situation--backwardation--typically occurs at times of market deficit and in it, prices for front-month contracts are higher than the ones further out in time.   The supply and demand balance on the oil market could tip into deficit as early as in June, according to some analysts, including Goldman Sachs. Improving global oil demand and faster-than-expected production curtailments from outside the OPEC pact are set to push the oil market into deficit in June, according to Goldman Sachs. Yet, there is little room for an oil price rally in the near term because of the still sizeable oversupply of crude oil and refined products, Goldman Sachs said in a note in the middle of May. But the contango on the oil market could outlast the immediate deficit because of a high amount of oil on floating storage, according to data from Citi cited by Reuters. "An inflection point is happening in physical fundamentals, although oil-on-water may cast a shadow on the recovery," according to Citi. During the 'peak lockdown' period when every major economy except China was under lockdown in late March and early April, the oil market was in a state of super contango. The glut was growing, storage capacity was shrinking as oil demand cratered, and on top of this, OPEC's leader and the world's top exporter, Saudi Arabia, was intent on further cratering the market with a supply surge, before it sat down -urged by the U.S. - to forge a new deal with Russia for record production cuts. Since the beginning of May, demand has started to slowly recover while supply is coming off the market from the OPEC cuts and economics-driven curtailments in North America. But the sizable oil in storage, including floating storage for which traders have chartered tankers for at least six months, could keep the market in contango even though it could tip into deficit.

Johnny possessed a deep love for his home state of Arkansas and was a devout Arkansas Razorback fan throughout his life. Johnny spent his early years in his beloved hometown of Austin, Arkansas, and attended school in the neighboring town of Cabot. Upon graduating high school, Johnny was drafted and proudly served his country in the United States Army as a finance clerk in Vietnam during the war. Once Johnny returned home, he continued his education at Arkansas State University where he met his wife, Vickie, and earned two bachelor’s degrees in Business Management and Real Estate Insurance.
 In 1976, he and Vickie moved to Texas and started their own sod farming business in Cedar Lane. Johnny enjoyed the simple things in life and in nature, quickly making the farm a place he loved to spend his days; especially with his daughter, Tess. Johnny was a dedicated employee of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company where he worked as an Ethylene Unit Operator for over 25 years. A surprise to his coworkers, Johnny was a vegetarian and an impressive gardener - he was always happiest when they cooked a pot of beans! It was uncommon to see Johnny without a smile on his face, always taking time for children, elderly adults and animals.

The coach is also a health and physical education instructor at Lake Shore. He graduated from Wayne State University in 2010 and holds both master's and bachelor's degrees.
 This spring has obviously been much, much different for both teachers and coaches. Since school is closed, there has been no personal contact with the students. Every lesson is delivered online. That is the same mode of communication between coaches and players.
 “It is just so different. It is hard to not be able to deal with kids face to face. I have a master's degree in technology so that is not it,” he said. “The personal relationships are harder to maintain this way.”
 The football coaches and players held a team meeting Thursday night. That hardly meant gathering around of video screen or a chalkboard in the locker room, classroom or gymnasium. Instead, it was via Zoom.
 “We meet as a team once a week,” said Puvalowki. “Tonight (Thursday) we are talking about the summer and how that is going to work. About half of the meeting, we just let the kids talk among themselves. A lot of them don’t get to see each other much anymore. After that, the coaches take over.”
 Puvalowski takes over for Rich Popp. The Shorians finished 4-5 overall, 1-4 in the MAC Gold Division. They will be in the MAC Gold this year.
 In 2018, Lake Shore went to the playoffs.
 The 2020 team will have 17 returning starters. That talent and experience will be needed. Seven of the nine teams Lake Shore meets made it into the 2019 post-season.
 Puvalowski was a lineman for the Shorians. He played for Rich Bower. Bower is now on his former coach’s staff.
 “To me, football was an awesome experience. To be accountable to your coaches and teammates was a great life lesson. The game really helped me grow up. I really am not too sure what I would be doing now if I hadn’t played football in high school,” Puvalowski said.

THE CANADIAN PRESSAlberta Minister of Health Tyler Shandro provides details on a new initiative intended to distribute non-medical masks to Albertans to prevent the spread of COVID-19, in Calgary on Friday.
 Shandro said that starting in early June, people will be able to use drive- thru lanes at McDonald's, A&W and Tim Hortons to pick up single use, three- layer, non-medical masks designed to filter germs and pollution particles.
 The masks come in packages of four, and one package will be handed out per person.
 No food purchase is necessary to obtain them, said Shandro, and no money is going to the restaurant chains for pick-up or distribution.
 At just below $1 per mask, the province is spending just under $2 million on the project. About $350,000 will be spent on getting masks to remote areas that don't have those restaurants.
 But Shandro said 95 per cent of Albertans live within 10 kilometres of a drive-thru. The participating businesses have about 600 drive-thrus in the province.
 He said the masks can be picked up only in drive-thru lanes, not inside the restaurant, to maintain physical distancing.
 He acknowledged that four masks per person is not enough in the long term, but will help some people get through the crunch of the crisis and that Albertans are encouraged to source their own masks in the future.

Now, this could be a blessing or a curse for the Flyers in either scenario. On one hand, you could win all three games and vault to the top or lose all three and lose nothing. But losing each of the three games upon return doesn’t exactly build confidence in where the team is at that point. Similarly, winning all three games could theoretically give you a more difficult first- round matchup. In the event that the NHL decides to use a bracket-style playoff and not reseed after the qualifying round, the team that is the four- seed could play the 12th-seeded Montreal Canadiens if they were to beat Pittsburgh, which a team in the first seed would play the winner of the 8-seed and 9-seed matchup. That could be a disadvantage to a team like the Flyers if they were to vault to the top and then get hit with a more difficult opponent than out of the four seed.

Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], May 29 (ANI): The hotel industry is one of the worst-hit industries due to lockdown, along with the tourism industry. Bengaluru's hotel industry has incurred a loss of around Rs 1200 crore during the lockdown period however, the hotels here are likely to open in June if the State government issues guidelines for the resumption of their services.   Speaking to ANI, PC Rao, President, Bangalore Hotelier's Association said, "It's not only the loss of business, but we have lost the customer base as well. We don't expect any good future for the next six months. There will be a slow down in the business even after opening."   "We have requested our CM to give first preference to the hotels. We are going to restart our business in June if granted permission. Around 10 per cent of the hotels cannot open at all. They are in the stage of merging or closing down position. Few hotels may open after five or six months," he added.   He continued saying that many hotels are for sale but there are no buyers. There are around 21,000 restaurants in Bangalore, 3500 hotels with rooms and restaurant which has an average turnover of Rs 20 crores per day, Rao informed.   "We expect losses of around Rs 1200 crores in these two months. We are giving special online training to all the hoteliers and to our managers particularly to deal with the COVID-19 situation, including how to deal with the guests, employees, how to start the hotel services. Each and every manager has already been trained and we are still continuing it. We will conduct face to face meeting as well and brief the managers," said Rao. (ANI)

COVID-19 has put a damper on almost everything. Several concert tours have either been canceled or postponed. Even new music and album releases have been hampered.      By this point most years, I'm putting together a column predicting what the songs of summer will be. I don't see the point of doing that now. Nothing "feels" like summer, nor does there seem to be a surge from the music industry to push songs.      I understand it, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. I can say this, though: If you're a true artist, you're finding ways to weather this current situation.      I'm loving all the internet videos from artists on YouTube, Facebook Live and other outlets. It is a way for them to keep in touch and entertain the masses. It doesn't compare to a live show, but it's music.      Several artists have canceled tours, including the much-hyped pairing of Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams. Elton John scrapped his "Farewell" tour for another year and I recently learned Janet Jackson's "Black Diamond" tour has been postponed. I was looking forward to seeing her perform again.      Taylor Swift also canceled her tour. This was a big deal, considering the tour was to support her latest hit album, "Lover," her first LP since her highly publicized departure from Big Machine Records. Swift left the label so she could have more say and rights to her own music. Matters turned even uglier when it was later made known that Swift's nemesis, Scooter Braun, had purchased her catalog when he joined her former label. Braun owns the rights to the music from Swift's first six albums.      Swift's canceled tour is a major bummer for her and her fans. But that hasn't stopped the singer. First, she performed on the televised "One World" concert for COVID-19 relief for front-line workers. Then, ABC gave her a prime spot following the "American Idol" season finale, airing a special one-hour performance, taped last fall in Paris, of Swift performing music from "Lover."      Last weekend, Swift may have done what her diehard fans wanted her to do the most. She tweeted her love for the cover of her song "Look What You Made Me Do" heard in an episode of "Killing Eve." The song was credited to a fictional band called Jack Leopards & The Dolphin Club. Boom!      This was a huge move. At one time, Swift's brother Austin went by The Dolphin Club on social media. The song was produced by Nils Sjoberg, which was a pseudonym Swift used on a track she produced with Calvin Harris. The last part of this plan was Swift asked "Killing Eve" executive producers to have her brother featured on the show's soundtrack.      If you haven't heard the track, check it out. It's stellar and has a different feel to it than it did before. If this is, indeed, Austin, then the world had better make room for another Swift.   Sorry, Scooter - Look what you made Taylor Swift do.   David T. Farr can be reached at farrboy@hotmail.com.

New Delhi [India], May 29 (ANI): The Union Government has approved Rs 445 crore for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission in Chhattisgarh during 2020-21.   According to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, the Chhattisgarh government presented its annual action plan for 2020-21 for consideration and approval.   The Ministry said Chhattisgarh has planned to have 100 per cent Functional Tap Water Connection (FHTC) by 2023-24. Out of 45 lakh households in the state, it has planned to provide tap connections to 20 lakh households.   "While planning for universal coverage of households, priority is being given to water-scarce areas, quality-affected areas, SC/ST dominated habitations/villages, aspirational districts, Sansad Adarsh Gramin Yojana villages. The Government of India has approved Rs 445 crore for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission in the State in 2020-21," said the ministry.   Jal Jeevan Mission aims to provide adequate potable drinking water of prescribed quality on a regular and long-term basis to every rural household of the country by 2024. A budget of whopping Rs 3.60 lakh crore has been allocated for this scheme.   Chhattisgarh has been battling with the issue of rapid ground-water depletion and chemical contamination of arsenic, fluoride, iron, etc., in water for many years, thus taking cognisance of the situation the State was advised to ensure the provision of potable water in these habitations.   Under Jal Jeevan Mission, the emphasis is being given on water quality surveillance through active participation of frontline functionaries as well as involving the community. School and college students are being encouraged to use the field test Kits to test the quality of water being provided in rural areas.   According to an official statement, the State is ensuring convergence of funds from various sources like MGNREGS, 15th Finance Commission grants to rural local bodies, SBM, etc., for taking up works related to the strengthening of water resources, aquifer recharge, greywater management.   With summers in full swing, monsoons approaching, and country grappling with COVID-19 pandemic, it has become more imperative to provide a livelihood to the migrant workers who have returned to their native villages, said the Ministry.   According to the Ministry, these migrant labourers are basically skilled and semi-skilled ones, whose services could be effectively utilised in villages by providing jobs related to water supply, especially plumbing, fitting, water conservation works, etc., in every village to ensure sufficient ground-water availability leading to water security, water availability for agriculture and most importantly will help in the provision of drinking water to every rural household.

“Right now the conversation that we’ve had to have with our boys has now even extended to even having that conversation with our girls,” Carr said.
 It doesn’t matter if the protests are in Minneapolis. The emotions and heaviness African Americans are feeling right now, Carr says, have been around for centuries.
 “America was built on a paradigm with White Supremacy at the very top. That structure still exists today. So, for those who are in the various segments of our community who have the power to effect and affect change, this is the moment to show up,” Carr said.
 Carr feels that the best way to change all of this, is for everyone to just speak openly about race. To talk about the challenges African Americans, Latino Americans and Asian Americans face every single day. Doing so, Carr says, is the only way we can truly move forward as a society in love and unity.
 “People are tired now, they’re frustrated now. They’ve seen it enough. We’ve been there enough, stood the microphones enough. Now the question has to resonate with all of us what am I willing to do to make a change now,” Carr said.
 Carr just wants this progress to happen sooner rather than later. So this generational “talk” he’s had with his kids and his parents had with him can finally end right here in 2020.

At least 300,000 more displaced Filipinos were expected to journey home, “but this time, we should know what to do,” the blunt-speaking leader said.
 Hans Cacdac, who heads the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, told a congressional hearing Friday that public transport restrictions under the Manila lockdown prevented the workers from being moved out of the capital en masse, but said most have been brought back to their provinces this week after the president intervened. Only 4,000 remain stranded in the capital, including about 1,500 on board cruise ships in Manila Bay, he said.
 Lawmakers hit the lack of coordination and foresight that led to the congestion.
 Interior Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III said that a 14-day quarantine had been relaxed to allow the workers to immediately leave for home once test results clear them of infection. The move will help prevent quarantine congestion and will cut short the extra two-week wait in isolation that prolongs the homecoming of healthy workers, officials said.
 Christopher Bagay, a kitchen crew of the Aida Sol cruise ship in Europe, said it took him about two months to go through repetitive quarantines in Spain, Germany and Manila. Arriving home in Laguna province, south of Manila, on Thursday night, he sneaked into a room and hid from his 3-year-old son after deciding to go into 14 more days of home quarantine to protect his family.
 Arenas said he used the long quarantine that delayed his return home to record songs, mostly in duets with fellow entertainers, that were a tribute to his late father. He posted the poignant tunes on Facebook, including one with a message where he thanked friends around the world for reaching out to him.
 “It is challenging mentally to be isolated in your room,” Arenas said. “But it is even harder when you lose a family member back home while in isolation.”
