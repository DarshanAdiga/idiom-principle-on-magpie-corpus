The source further told the portal that there have already been several delays to the film. Moreover, everyone was keen to get it up and running at the first possible second. Which is why slipping in before the 14-day quarantine rules came in on Monday made sense. The source added that this would hopefully mean that the film can get back on track and finish filming without any more delays.

Men have short memories. Those who currently think that they are all- powerfull would also, like all mortals, turn the corner to an inevitable end, in their journey on earth. High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs may be the subject of discourse today, the whole world may be talking about his travails in death, his family may be given over to public ridicule but the journey to the grave for the High Chief is about to come to an end.

"Radio Raheem is a fictional character from my 1989 film _Do The Right Thing_ , but his murder is based on the real murder -- so that's where I got the idea," Lee explained to host Jimmy Fallon, adding that the fictional violence that kills Raheem was inspired by the killing of Michael Stewart, a New York City graffiti artist.

That's the year Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment for a one-tenth-of-one-percent sales tax for parks, soil, and water conservation. DNR agricultural liaison Kurt Boeckmann testifies the tax has been crucial.

In what was most definitely a first of its kind ceremony, members of Marblehead High School's Class of 2020 crossed an empty stage alone with Pomp and Circumstance playing in the background, as they graduated Friday June 5 -- on YouTube.
 "Today's exercises are certainly not what you envisioned they would be just a few short months ago," said Interim Superintendent William McAlduff to a largely empty auditorium. "It goes without saying that the world, your world, has certainly been turned upside down."
 No one could have thought that senior year would have ended with a stay at home advisory, remote learning, social distancing, face masks and all the rest, he said.
 McAlduff was just one of the traditional speakers that took part in a very untraditional ceremony that was painstakingly filmed and edited over the last several weeks before debuting on You Tube June 5 at 6 p.m.
 McAlduff noted that better days lay ahead and he had no doubt that the Class of 2020 would meet future challenges as successfully as they had met the current one.
 "It's my pleasure to wish you a bright, healthy and successful future, congratulations," he said.
 Just before McAlduff spoke, MHS senior Shakeriah Baxter recognized her peers as the Class of COVID-19, in her welcoming address. She remarked how they had grown from immature little kids to independent, smart young adults and thanked those who had helped them along the way with lessons both inside and outside the classroom.
 "We are grateful for whacky pants Wednesdays, Thanksgiving TikToks, cartwheels on demand and countless other memories," she said adding, "We have missed out on being together these last few months but we will never forget we are the class that made history."
 'We will rise to the occasion'
 Class President Reid Tully urged his classmates to focus on what they've found over their four years at MHS rather than what they've lost to the coronavirus pandemic. Friendships, success in athletics, the arts and other activities as well as the capacity to be resilient is what they've gained, he said.
 "We need to continue to actively pay attention to the world around us to identify and solve the problems that will undoubtedly face us as we move on from high school," Tully said. "I am confident and hopeful that we will rise to the occasion. This pandemic has reinforced that it is OK to need each other, to miss each other, and more importantly, to help each other."
 'Remember the good times'
 Before Hayden Miller delivered his salutatorian address, seniors from the MHS chorus performed the Beatles tune "In My Life" as arranged and produced by their classmate Nicolas Sears.
 Miller thanked all those that made their high school years special. From teachers to administrators to his fellow seniors.
 "I never thought these words would leave my mouth, but I can confidently say that I will miss high school," he said.
 Miller also urged his classmates "to remember the good times, celebrate your accomplishments, and thank the people that have helped you to become the person you are today."
 Focus on optimism
 Throughout her speech, Valedictorian Jillian Lederman wove a backup speech written by William Safire for Richard Nixon in the event that the Apollo 11 space mission failed. In his speech, that Nixon never delivered, Safire focused on optimism not loss, which Lederman said directly applied to their class.
 She urged her classmates not to dwell on what they missed but to look to what they still have, their teachers, family and friends -- their heroes.
 "So yes: we lost time," she said. "But what we gained from this experience is infinitely more important."
 She also pointed out that while the primary purpose of school is to prepare students for adulthood, "our class's unconventional experience is perhaps the most accurate representation of how real life works."
 Lederman she hoped that the chaos of their senior year taught them how to respond to inevitable chaos of life.
 "I hope that our exploration will never stop. I hope that we will become remarkable. And I hope that someday, we will look back and find that the footprints of the Class of 2020 reached places no one has ever been before," she said.
 'You've made each day fun'
 In his speech Principal Dan Bauer called the Class of 2020 special in many ways.
 "And I believe this is an understatement," he added. "I've had the pleasure of working with you and seeing your growth over the last four years … I can honestly say that you've made each day fun as your principal."
 Bauer said did not believe the coronavirus crisis diminished their contributions to the school or how they would be remembered.
 "You have changed the school culture by your positivity," he said.
 As he came to the end of his speech, Bauer said that was where he would typically provide lessons and takeaways for the seniors and his go-to messages were be positive, believe in yourself and be nice.
 "I have to be honest," he said. "The Class of 2020 embodies all of these areas. And to that - I couldn't be more proud."
 Once the students finished crossing the stage Bauer announced them graduates and School Committee Sarah Gold confirmed their destiny as she asked them to move their tassels to the left.
 There was no grand procession of graduates and only a small virtual cap toss but the band played "Marblehead Forever" as the screen faded to black.

With 1,256 cases of COVID-19 reported in Jharkhand up until the now, the state government continues to tread cautiously even as the country moves towards a gradual 'unlocking' of various sectors after over two months of life under lockdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Starting June 8, the state has begun a staggered lifting of restrictions imposed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the Centre's 'Unlock 1.0' guidelines.

Da qui a fine anno 'perderemo altre decine di migliaia di posti di lavoro' a causa della crisi legata all'emergenza covid. Ma 'ce la faremo'. A dirlo e il governatore dell'Emilia-Romagna, Stefano Bonaccini, che oggi ha illustrato le linee di mandato in Assemblea legislativa. 'Vogliamo costruire un'Emilia- Romagna piu forte e piu giusta - afferma Bonaccini - che sappia recuperare i lavoro perduto. Credevamo di essere vicini al 4% di disoccupazione, invece dopo quello sforzo straordinario che ci porto a dimezzarla, oggi gli indicatori economici ci dicono che perderemo altre decine di migliaia di posti di lavoro da qui a fine anno'. Per questo, afferma il presidente, 'abbiamo bisogno di recuperare ogni posto di lavoro perduto, tutelare quelli in bilico, creare lavoro di qualita e ridare fiducia e speranza alla nostra gente'.      Detta in altri termini, avverte Bonaccini, 'ci servira di tutto per farcela. Ma io sono sicuro che ce la faremo. Fu cosi dopo la guerra, e stato cosi dopo il terremoto e non c'e ragione di credere che non sia cosi oggi e nei prossimi anni. Dipende da noi'. L'emergenza covid, sottolinea anche Bonaccini in un altro passaggio del suo discorso, 'ci costringe a costruire una societa nuova, non certo a tornare a quella vecchia. Servono piu diritti e opportunita, non regressioni'. In particolare, ribadisce il governatore, 'dobbiamo avere la forza di rimettere la scuola al primo posto, perche il Paese non riparte senza la scuola. E lo stesso vale per i servizi zero-sei anni, per dare risposte alle famiglie e restituire ai piu piccoli spazi di socialita'. Non dobbiamo arretrare di un millimetro sul terremo della conciliazione', avverte Bonaccini.      Il ritorno alla normalita dopo l'emergenza sanitaria 'non puo significare il ritorno alla rissa politica, come ho visto negli ultimi giorni - ha aggiunto Bonaccini -. Non e nelle divisioni che il Paese puo trovare le risposte per rialzarsi, come ha detto il presidente Mattarella. Sono parole di saggezza, dovrebbero guidarci tutti'.   E rivolgendosi alle opposizioni in Regione. 'Ci serve ogni contributo genuino per dare risposte efficaci e correggere i nostri errori - tende la mano Bonaccini - non abbiamo la verita in tasca, non ho mai detto che non ho sbagliato niente durante l'emergenza. Per questo invito tutti a scegliere il confronto e non lo scontro. Io da questo terreno non mi muovero. Siamo chiamati a un salto di qualita, in un mondo che e gia cambiato e che richiede il meglio'. In definitiva, ammonisce Bonaccini, 'c'e una ricostruzione che ci aspetta e dobbiamo rimboccarci le maniche. Buon senso vorrebbe che lo facessimo insieme, ciascuno per le sue responsabilita, senza rinunciare alle proprie ragioni ma anteponendo a tutto il bene comune'. Nei prossimi mesi 'ci aspetta uno straordinario sforzo collettivo - insiste il presidente - e per compierlo bene serve un Paese unito e un obiettivo condiviso. Una classe dirigente e tale se nei momenti di difficolta sa fare questa scelta', manda a dire Bonaccini.
