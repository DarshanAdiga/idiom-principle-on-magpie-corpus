 The company claims to have attracted 1 million app developers for Huawei AppGallery.
 Honor will continue using Android operating system as it is an open source platform and free for any company to use it and develop their operating system by using it as a base.
 The United States government barred its companies from supplying software and hardware to Huawei in May last year. However, it has been extending temporary licence for supplying restricted products and services to the Chinese telecom gear major.
 Huawei, along with Honor, commands second position on global level in terms of market share and is next to South Korean technology giant Samsung.
 Mr. Peng said that Huawei is in talks with Indian companies as well to bring them on AppGallery and many of the frequently used apps have already come on board.
 When asked about Honor’s plan to attract users of leading social media apps specially US-based Facebook and Whatsapp, Mr. Peng said most of the third party apps provide an open source for downloading the mobile version and is already available for quick download.
 Peng said that Honor will prefer to work with Google, however, the company will continue to expand Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) as an alternate option.

When Prime Minister Joe Clark’s budget hiked gas taxes, he lost a confidence vote and an election after only nine months in office. When President, George Herbert Walker Bush, broke his “read my lips: no new taxes” pledge, he lost to Bill Clinton. Alberta Premier, Ed Stelmach, raised taxes on the energy sector by jacking up royalty rates and was gone as Premier within ten months. Ernie Eves raised taxes soon after becoming Ontario Premier and promptly lost an election, reversing the back-to-back majorities of taxfighter, Mike Harris. In the early 1990s, the federal Progressive Conservative government introduced the GST and went from a majority government to merely two seats. New Brunswick Premier David Alward’s 2013/14 budget raised taxes by $200 million and in the following year’s election he lost his government and half his caucus. Alberta’s Progressive Conservative government announced hikes to income, gas and alcohol taxes in the 2015 budget and two months later lost to the NDP, finished third place and ended their 44-year dynasty, the longest of any party in Canada’s history.
 It is true that there are many factors that lead to parties or leaders losing office. But is it just an extraordinary coincidence that voters have promptly driven out of office every federal or provincial conservative leader who raised taxes in the last three decades?
 No. It is no coincidence. When conservative parties support tax increases, they get crushed.
