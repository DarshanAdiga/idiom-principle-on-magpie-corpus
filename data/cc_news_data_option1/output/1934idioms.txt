Solo en la ciudad de Sens, en el centro de Francia, se cerraron 25 escuelas porque hubo "un caso de COVID-19" en un adulto.


  El ministro dijo que a veces se les reprocha ser demasiado prudentes y en otras no serlo suficientemente: "Estamos muy atentos a que haya el menor riesgo posible".


  Este lunes volvieron a los colegios 185.000 estudiantes de dos niveles de secundaria en los departamentos que se encuentran en verde, es decir, en una situación epidémica menos comprometida.


  Blanquer dijo esperar que las condiciones sanitarias permitirán "ir más lejos" y dar también clase antes del verano a estudiantes de esos mismos niveles en los departamentos en rojo, que cubren cuatro regiones del norte y del noreste, incluida la de París.


  Eso se determinará a finales de mes, en función de las condiciones sanitarias en ese momento. También entonces se tomará una decisión sobre el eventual retorno de los estudiantes de los liceos.


  Los alumnos de secundaria, a diferencia de los de primaria, tienen que llevar mascarilla en clase y solo se la pueden quitar para comer.


  En primaria, únicamente un 30 % de los alumnos han vuelto a tener clases presenciales, mientras que el 70 % continúan siguiendo los cursos a distancia, como durante el periodo de confinamiento, que en Francia se está levantando progresivamente desde el 11 de mayo.


  En el país se han superado los 28.100 muertos con la COVID-19 y continúa habiendo más de 19.300 personas hospitalizadas, de las cuales cerca de 2.100 están en las unidades de cuidados intensivos.

  Pasuvanthanai police have arrested a youth and his father for allegedly murdering a 70-year-old man and his son.


  Police said K. Kalisamy, 40, of Therkku Bommaiahpuram under Pasuvanthanai police station limits, K. Balamurugan, 22, of the same area and a few others were participating in a feast organised in the village on Sunday night to celebrate the victory of their party candidate in the local body elections held in last December.


  Since the banquet was conducted after a long delay after a few postponements, a good number of cadre of a political party from the village participated in the cocktail dinner.


  As an argument broke out between Kalisamy and Balamurugan even as they were under the influence of alcohol, others participating in the dinner pacified them. However, the altercation resurfaced even as they were returning home. An infuriated Balamurugan allegedly hacked Kalisamy.


  On getting information, Kalisamy’s younger brother Maharajan, 38, came to the spot and took the victim on a bike to the Primary Health Centre at Pasuvanthanai for treatment.


  Meanwhile, Kalisamy’s agitated father Karuppasamy, 70, rushed to Balamurugan’s house only to be hacked to death on the spot by Balamurugan, who also murdered Maharajan when he returned home late in the night after admitting his injured brother in the PHC.


  Balamurugan and his father Kalipandi were arrested.

Johannesburg [South Africa], May 18 (ANI): South Africa opener Aiden Markram on Monday said that he wants to lead Proteas in the longest format of the game but he is not desperate for the role.   "I really enjoy captaincy. I enjoy the responsibilities that come with it. I would give an absolute arm and a leg to be able to do it, but I have said it before in the same breath, it's not the be-all and end-all so I don't want to become desperate about it," ESPNcricinfo quoted Markram as saying.   The 25-year-old opening batsman has played 20 Tests for the side and scored 1424 runs at an average of 38.48. He also holds the experience of leading South Africa's Under-19 team to World Cup glory in 2014.   Markram has spent most of the 2019-20 season sidelined with an injury and understands the need to cement his place in the team before he can be seriously considered to lead it.   "I thoroughly enjoy captaining and would be honoured if it were the case, but I don't want to look too much into it. If it were to happen, it would be amazing. But if not, there are plenty of good leaders within the environment that will take the team forward along with the management. My main focus is trying to get back into the side and stay on the field," he said.   Earlier, spinner Keshav Maharaj said that he would be more than willing to lead the side in all three formats of the game. Maharaj has some leadership experience behind him as he was the captain of the domestic side Dolphins during the One-Day Cup this season.   The Dolphins were awarded the title after Cricket South Africa (CSA) suspended the domestic season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   After Faf du Plessis stepped down as the captain of South Africa, Quinton de Kock replaced him as the ODI skipper of the Proteas. De Kock also led South Africa in the T20I series against England and Australia this year.   The CSA is yet to name the skipper of the Test side. Proteas was slated to tour Sri Lanka for three ODIs and three T20Is, but the series has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. (ANI)

China will make its coronavirus vaccine a global public good once one is available, President Xi Jinping told the World Health Organization's governing body.Xi's comments come amid growing concern that countries will put national interests first in the quest for a protective shot, seen as the key to getting economies moving again. The WHO is pushing a proposal that aims to ensure broad access to treatments and vaccines while offering an appropriate reward to creators."Covid-19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good, which will be China's contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries," Xi said in a speech to the World Health Assembly.Among the dozens of vaccine projects under way worldwide, China has five candidates already in human trials. More will be approved next month.The country has faced rising scrutiny over its handling of the virus, especially from members of the Trump administration. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in a television appearance that the country sent "hundreds of thousands of Chinese on aircraft to Milan, New York and around the world to seed" it.Xi said China acted with transparency and responsibility all along, and that it provided information to the WHO and countries in the most timely fashion. China will also provide $2 billion over two years to support the fight against the pandemic, especially in developing countries, he said.Some companies involved in vaccine development have said countries that provide funding will get first dibs.AstraZeneca Plc Chief Exective Officer Pascal Soriot said the U.K. will take priority for the University of Oxford's fast- moving effort to develop a shot. French drugmaker Sanofi's vaccine that received funding from the U.S. will likely be used there initially, CEO Paul Hudson said last week. Sanofi said later that its vaccine would be available to everyone.

El Consejo Internacional de la Iniciativa para la Transparencia de la Industria Extractiva (EITI) reconoció que la República Dominicana ha alcanzado un “progreso significativo” en la implementación del Estándar EITI 2016, informó en un comunicado de prensa el Ministerio de Energía y Minas
 De acuerdo a la nota, la instancia de EITI felicitó al gobierno de la República Dominicana y a la Comisión Nacional EITI-RD por el progreso confirmado para mejorar la transparencia y rendición de cuentas en las industrias extractivas.
 “Nos sentimos muy satisfechos de la valoración de EITI sobre el esfuerzo que hemos hecho en la República Dominicana, pero nuestra satisfacción es mayor por ver que esto se ha realizado en un tiempo récord, insólito para un país que no tenía la tradición de transparencia en este tipo de actividad, tanto en el sector público como en el privado”, afirmó el Ministro de Energía y Minas, Antonio Isa Conde.
 La institución estatal destacó que la validación demostró que la implementación de EITI en la República Dominicana ha mejorado la disponibilidad de información y fortalecido el diálogo entre las partes interesadas, convirtiéndose en una plataforma útil para discusiones sobre reformas respecto a la distribución de ingresos y los acuerdos entre el gobierno central y los gobiernos locales.
 El Portal de Transparencia EITI-RD (www.eitird.mem.gob.do) proporciona información, en un formato accesible y comprensible, sobre los contratos, datos de producción, exportación e ingresos en formato abierto, lo cual permite un debate informado sobre el sector extractivo, explica Energía y Minas.
 El Consejo otorgó a República Dominicana seis meses a partir de su reunión celebrada el 14 de febrero de 2020, es decir, hasta el 14 de agosto de 2020, para prepararse antes de la segunda validación para llevar a cabo acciones correctivas con respecto a tres requisitos que deben ser mejorados, los cuales se relacionan con los datos de producción, las transferencias subnacionales y los resultados e impacto del EITI implementación, con la finalidad de lograr un progreso satisfactorio.
 De los 22 requisitos del Estándar EITI que aplican a la República Dominicana, el país calificó en 2 en progreso “más allá”, significando que el país sobrepasó el requisito, obtuvo 17 en progreso “satisfactorio”, significando que “el país cumple con el requisito del EITI”, y 3 en progreso “significativo”, significando que el país ha avanzado en el cumplimiento del requisito, y que se están implementando elementos importantes de dicho requisito y su objetivo más global se está cumpliendo.

At a minimum, I would expect the next bear market would have us revisit the 1800SPX region in the second half of the new decade. So, enjoy the profits of this “last hurrah” over the coming several years, as we are likely setting up for a once in a century event, which can rival the Great Depression, as it is of the same long-term wave degree. Remember, while history does not exactly repeat, it certainly does rhyme. And, those that are unwilling to learn from history are certainly bound to repeat it.


  But, in the meantime, I still think we reach at least the 4000 region, but there is strong potential for us to target as high as 6000 in the SPX. After this next segment of the market rally off the 2009 low completes, I will then move into the bear camp for quite some time. But, for now, there are still profits to be gained on the long side of the market for the next few years.

The internal rate of return for the bond component is rather sensitive to changes in the valuation of the linked call options. A variation of 10% in the initial net value of the underlying call options results in an inverse move in the internal rate of return of the bond component of about half a percentage point.


  In the meantime, in the event the company’s share price exceeds $8.75, the convertible notes will eventually be convertible into as many as 52.3 million common shares – in comparison to just under 170 million shares outstanding at the end of the last fiscal year. The convertible notes can be converted into a nearly 25% ownership interest in the company!


  The market’s negative reaction to the company’s issuance of the convertible bonds, in our view, had less to do with the issuance of debt and more to do with the issuance of debt under such unfavorable conditions. The outcome begs the question of what the company was doing issuing convertible debt when The Gap recently issued fixed rate notes of various maturities with similar average interest rates. American Eagle would surely warrant a lower fixed interest rate than Gap given its much stronger financial position. Yet – it didn’t either by choosing not to do so or, worse for shareholders, couldn’t do so for some undefined reason.


  Or, consider the convertible note issuance from an alternative perspective – the share prices at which the company would effectively “break even” relative to the interest saved by including the convertibility feature. In other words, taking the convertible notes as a defined unit and looking at the cash requirements to service and ultimately pay off the debt under both scenarios, we can assess the common stock share prices at which the company would need to repurchase the shares issuable upon conversion in order for the convertible notes to be the cash flow equivalent of a standard fixed rate note.


  The after tax difference in interest expense between the convertible notes and equivalent fixed rate notes at 8.75% is about $16 million per year or $0.35 per convertible share. In effect, the company roughly “breaks even” (on a simplified calculation which ignores for a moment the time value of money) should the company’s shares trade at or below the following valuations in the future:

E-commerce companies are expecting to see pent-up demand for non-essential products from red zones, as they gear up to begin taking orders for their full range of products in these regions, outside of containment zones.


  Many leading e-commerce firms opened their platforms to begin accepting orders for a broader range of products on Monday in non-containment regions located in red zones. However, a lot will depend on how States look at it, as following the Ministry of Home Affairs guidelines for lockdown 4.0, each State is coming out with its own norms.


  Srinivas Mothey, Senior Vice-President, Paytm Mall, the initial response has been encouraging as most red zones are placing orders. Inter-State movement of non-essential goods will be key in scale-up of e-commerce activity in the country, he added.


  “Our merchants, offline shopkeepers, and logistics partners have all ramped up operations in tier-I metro cities and all red zones in the country. We have opened up all our pin-codes and now taking orders for non-essentials delivery,” he said.


  With a large chunk of sales coming from urban centres for e-commerce, opening up of red zones is being considered as a significant move, as most urban centres are in the red zone. Players said it will be crucial to see how the situation evolves in urban centres in various States, especially in Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat. E-commerce firms will need to work closely with State governments on delivering non-essential products in red zones.


  A spokesperson for Shopclues said, “For almost two months now, people across India have been holding back on making their non-essential purchases. In urban centres such as the metros, an entire office-going population has shifted to working from home. A pent-up demand and pending requirements to make the Work- From-Home experience seamless will drive the purchase patterns on e-commerce sites.”


  Shopclues said it has started witnessing huge surge in demand for non- essentials especially in categories such as mobiles & accessories, summer fashion, including dresses, cotton trousers, footwear, home fitness essentials and grooming appliances in red zones.


  Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO, SSPL, said, “We expect to see many new buyers getting onto to e-commerce in the coming days. For products such as television, laptops and mobile phones a huge pent-up demand is expected from the red zones outside the containment zones.”


  Flipkart spokesperson said, “Post the government guideline we are awaiting the guidelines and advisories from the different States.”

China will make its coronavirus vaccine a global public good once one is available, President Xi Jinping told the World Health Organization's governing body.


  Xi's comments come amid growing concern that countries will put national interests first in the quest for a protective shot, seen as the key to getting economies moving again. The WHO is pushing a proposal that aims to ensure broad access to treatments and vaccines while offering an appropriate reward to creators.


  "Covid-19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good, which will be China's contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries," Xi said in a speech to the World Health Assembly.


  Among the dozens of vaccine projects under way worldwide, China has five candidates already in human trials. More will be approved next month.


  The country has faced rising scrutiny over its handling of the virus, especially from members of the Trump administration. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in a television appearance that the country sent "hundreds of thousands of Chinese on aircraft to Milan, New York and around the world to seed" it.


  Xi said China acted with transparency and responsibility all along, and that it provided information to the WHO and countries in the most timely fashion. China will also provide $2 billion over two years to support the fight against the pandemic, especially in developing countries, he said.


  Some companies involved in vaccine development have said countries that provide funding will get first dibs.


  AstraZeneca Plc Chief Exective Officer Pascal Soriot said the U.K. will take priority for the University of Oxford's fast-moving effort to develop a shot. French drugmaker Sanofi's vaccine that received funding from the U.S. will likely be used there initially, CEO Paul Hudson said last week.

WESTPORT - Summer is just around the corner, but whether vacationers will be able to enjoy a week or two at a summer rental property is still up in the air.


  Most of the summer rentals are booked, said real estate agent John Gifford of Even Keel Realty in Wesport. But Gov. Charlie Baker's orders prohibiting non- essential short-term stays leave a big question mark for those who have already rented, and those considering a week or two by the sea.


  Short-term rentals, defined as 31 days or less, include those weekly rentals families book months in advance. For many families, it's a summer tradition to come back year after year for a week or two in the summer. Sometimes to the same property, depending on whether it fits with the renters' lifestyle, said Gifford.


  For a property to not be a short term rental it has to be booked for a minimum of 32 days.


  "We get a mixture of both, but most of them are what we consider summer weekly vacation rentals. And sometimes they're one week, sometimes they're two or three or four depending on the person's availability to come to this part of the state or their finances," said Gifford of the Westport/Dartmouth area rentals.


  About 50 percent of those rental properties turn into winter rentals that run from September to June that appeal to students or transitional residents. But the summer rentals bring in the premium rates, said Gifford.


  About another 50 percent of those rentals are strictly summer cottages that don't have heat so they're closed up after the summer.


  Short term rentals are taxed in Massachusetts, providing the state with 5.7 percent. Local communities set an additional tax percentage, the same rate they charge for hotel rooms. In Westport, that means an additional 4 percent of tax revenue for the town.


  "The Commonwealth is able to bring in millions of dollars through taxation," said Gifford.


  The rentals he deals with run Saturday to Saturday. The first week of summer rentals this year starts the last week of June, which runs into the Fourth of July holiday that Saturday. Then it goes through Labor Day. The weekly rate ranges from about $1,200 for an older cottage with no laundry on the Westport River to $2,000 a week. He has one six-bedroom property that runs about $3,500 a week.


  Gifford said he starts getting calls for his rentals on New Year's Day, the first day they start booking for the season.


  "Most of them were tentatively booked the first week of January. At least 50 percent of them -- all the returning customers -- call me that week. I have them booked, but a lot of people have held off on sending their deposits or signing the lease agreement simply because of the unknown," said Gifford.


  Even if they've been booked and paid for, there's still no guarantee it will happen with the short-term rental ban in place.


  "Nobody's allowed to be on vacation in Massachusetts in other words," said Gifford. "Everybody's hoping that the governor is able to safely lift those restrictions (in relation to COVID-19) and we go somewhat back to normal. But only time will tell."


  Baker could do a number of things, said Gifford, including not allowing short-term renters from New York, the epicenter of the pandemic in this country, but green-lighting vacationers from Rhode Island and Massachusetts.


  "I've heard that Maine (rentals) is closed through August. The people there are up in arms because that's how the whole coastline makes its money, through tourists," added Gifford.


  Now the only sure way to vacation in the SouthCoast is to make a summer rental that's booked for 32 days or longer and Gifford said he has a few of those booked.


  One thing that has eased short-term renters' minds is an addendum the Massachusetts Association of Realtors recently put out that offers a remedy if a landlord is unable to offer the property at a specified time or if the renter is unable to travel during a specified rental timeframe because of COVID-19 restrictions.


  Gifford said there are a few short-term weeks still available in the SouthCoast and most of his renters are still hoping to be able to make it. "One gentleman, who's in his early 90s and has had health problems along the way, absolutely loves to come here with his family. This year they're looking for three weeks and he's hoping to do that because it could be his last and he's looking forward to it," Gifford said.

The situation is even worse for African Americans, who were not hired to pilot a commercial airplane until the 1960s. Things changed only because of a six-year battle against Continental Airlines waged by Marlon Green, who filed a discrimination complaint against the carrier. In 1963, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in his favor, paving the way for the first black pilot, David Ellsworth Harris, whom American Airlines hired in 1964. Green would follow suit at Continental in 1965.

El ministro dijo que a veces se les reprocha ser demasiado prudentes y en otras no serlo suficientemente: 'Estamos muy atentos a que haya el menor riesgo posible'.
 Este lunes volvieron a los colegios 185.000 estudiantes de dos niveles de secundaria en los departamentos que se encuentran en verde, es decir, en una situación epidémica menos comprometida.
 Blanquer dijo esperar que las condiciones sanitarias permitirán 'ir más lejos' y dar también clase antes del verano a estudiantes de esos mismos niveles en los departamentos en rojo, que cubren cuatro regiones del norte y del noreste, incluida la de París.
 Eso se determinará a finales de mes, en función de las condiciones sanitarias en ese momento. También entonces se tomará una decisión sobre el eventual retorno de los estudiantes de los liceos.
 Los alumnos de secundaria, a diferencia de los de primaria, tienen que llevar mascarilla en clase y solo se la pueden quitar para comer.
 En primaria, únicamente un 30 % de los alumnos han vuelto a tener clases presenciales, mientras que el 70 % continúan siguiendo los cursos a distancia, como durante el periodo de confinamiento, que en Francia se está levantando progresivamente desde el 11 de mayo.
 En el país se han superado los 28.100 muertos con la COVID-19 y continúa habiendo más de 19.300 personas hospitalizadas, de las cuales cerca de 2.100 están en las unidades de cuidados intensivos.

Bolder Industries increased investment in technical expertise, physical lab space, and its leadership team based on the success of its pilot programs. The Maryville, Missouri, Bolder Industries plant fully commercialized the solution, accepting end-of-life tires at the gate and extracting steel, BolderBlack® (Bolder Industries' recovered carbon black brand), gas, and petrochemicals with a 98% recovery rate and a net-positive energy facility. The net effect is a ~90% reduction of environmental impact across the board when considering greenhouse gas emissions, electricity, and water usage, and at a lower price. Bolder Industries' patent-pending manufacturing process offers all of the petroleum-based products inside of a tire another life, revealing re-use savings.

At the last turn before the bridge we spied a large flat gray object on the shoreline to our right. We paddled over to check it out and found a large snapping turtle resting in the sun comfortably burrowed into the mud. It lifted its reptilian head up and peered at us. We were eyeball to eyeball with it. The incoming tide lapped at its shell. Like us, it was slowly transitioning from winter slumber to spring revitalization. A flash of white caught our eye, and we spied a deer bounding through the marsh grasses 20 yards away.

The animation worked. No, it wasn’t the type of animation that you would find in a video game that would take years to make and $50 million to produce. But its rough nature was almost in recognition of our rough times, and a tribute to the team that went far beyond to find a workable solution to what appeared to be an unsolvable problem. The actors recorded their dialogue for the animated portions from their homes and uploaded it to a team in Los Angeles. The animation was created by Proof, Inc. in London and Atlanta, using the expertise of some 35 artists who created about 20 minutes of footage for the graphic novel-style episode, giving it an old comic book feel. Editors and composers were back in L.A. Thought bubbles and text boxes were added to help the audience understand what the characters were thinking when the animation might not have allowed. A final scene shows Agent Keen atop a building as she scans the dark cityscape, almost like a superhero, or super villain, plotting her next move. Kudos to all those who brought it to life.

A youth choir creating a charity song for Bury Hospice has dedicated their work to the memory of Olivia Campbell-Hardy.


  The 15-year-old, who was among the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, loved music and singing and had aspired to become a song and dance teacher.


  She had been part of Bury Young Voices choir which reformed as Encore Youth Choir following the attack.


  Now, the group - made up young people aged eight to 15 - has set itself the task of performing an anthem for Bury Hospice to help bridge a £950,000 funding gap in the coronavirus lockdown.


  The song, Why We Sing, will be released on Friday, May 22, marking three years since the arena attack.

You’re not the same person that you were before, you lose your focus and your passion. You become numb and in some ways, you feel lost. The validation you received from that person is no longer present. The love of that person is no longer present either. In return, you stop loving yourself, and that is a mistake we all make.
