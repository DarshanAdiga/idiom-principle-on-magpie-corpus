In 2014, Sandy Barbour took over an athletic department staring down financial peril.
 On the ledgers, Penn State had taken out a $48 million loan to pay off a fine levied by the NCAA and payable to child sexual abuse issues in Pennsylvania as part of its punishment for the Jerry Sandusky scandal.
 In the coffers, it had $30 million earmarked to cover a significant slate of operating expenses for a few years. In terms of reserves, there was nothing. Rebuilding the proud athletic department with a football program still reeling from sanctions and a national perception of disgrace didn’t promise to be an easy task.
 Today, Penn State is staring down fiscal issues that, potentially, are even bigger than the ones Barbour inherited.
 In her seventh year at the head of the athletic department, the vice president for Intercollegiate Athletics has said that Penn State could lose more than $100 million if coronavirus concerns prevent football from being played during the upcoming academic year, and they’ve already been postponed by the Big Ten this fall.
 That number would only drop, she said, to the tens of millions of dollars if games are held without paying customers cheering in the seats.
 “We have a long history and tradition of comprehensive excellence, across a fairly large number of sports, and certainly one of my goals would be to continue that tradition and continue that as one of our long-held values,” Barbour said. “But having said that, obviously this is going to be a very difficult financial situation.”
 So as athletic departments like Penn State’s merely cross fingers when it comes to a potential spring football season that could help alleviate some of the burden, they have already begun thinking of ways to mitigate burdens.
 Some funds will come in naturally. Money that would have been spent this fall for programs to travel to road games won’t be spent at least until spring. Penn State also mandated graduated-scale pay cuts for coaches and others in the athletic department earlier in the summer.
 Earlier this month, Barbour said she took a 15 percent pay cut on the $1.269 million base salary she was scheduled to earn in the 2020-21 school year.
 Last year, the Big Ten paid each of its member institutions in excess of $55 million, money earned by the conference mainly through media rights agreements. Barbour said the athletic department already has evaluated how much of that money it can expect if games are played and televised in the spring, as well as if they aren’t played at all.
 Barbour also noted that in the years since she has been in charge, the athletic department has built more than $25 million in reserves. That money was earmarked for facilities improvements Barbour has been planning and touting for years, but she said it will now have to be put toward narrowing any fiscal gap created by sports that can’t be played.
 As Penn State did in the wake of the Sandusky scandal in Barbour’s early days on the job, she said the department will rely on several outside possibilities to help mitigate financial issues. Things like fundraising efforts will have to be counted on, as will the generosity of donors.
 She also didn’t rule out the likelihood of having to take out another expensive loan like the one that covered the NCAA fine — Barbour said Penn State is still working to pay that off — to help make ends meet.
 “Everybody in the country is going through this,” she said. “I do think that we as an industry are going to take a step back and look at how we do things financially, but we’re going to work really hard to make sure that this has as little impact on our long-term competitiveness as it possibly can. Whether it’s our opportunities to increase our revenues, enhance our revenues, to have donors step up and tell us they want to help us through this, that’s what we’re going to have to do here over the course of the next nine months.
 “Hopefully, ‘21-22 is more of a regular year and get us headed back in the right direction.”

Shotgun wedding takes on a new meaning in this darkly funny horror comedy. Young bride Grace (Samara Weaving) is marrying into the filthy rich Le Domas clan. According to tradition, each new member of the family has to play a randomly allotted game on their wedding night. On most occasions, the game is innocuous. However, Grace draws a deadly version of hide and seek. Can she evade her murderous in-laws, now armed to the teeth with crossbows, axes and guns, until dawn? Combining gouts of gore, cutting satire and eye-watering black comedy, Ready or Not recalls such recent films as You're Next and Get Out in the way it pits a spunky representative of the 99% against members of a sadistic elite. The mood here is more comedy than horror, but we're still rooting all the way for the terrific Weaving's heroine, who keeps her nerve even as her bridal white dress turns increasingly bloodstained as the night wears on.

PLYMOUTH - Once the dream of two long-time friends, the J&M Baseball Academy is now a reality.
 "We've talked about putting something like this together for some time now, and the right pieces all finally fell into place," said Joe Flynn, who runs the business with his former Plymouth North baseball teammate Matt Walsh. "It's great that we were able to finally get this up and going. We put the word out about what we wanted to do and the response was amazing. Better than we could have ever hoped for."
 Flynn and Walsh's plan was to get an 18-and-under club baseball team going in Plymouth this fall to help local high school players get in a little work by playing in AAU tournaments each weekend around the state from September to mid-October. The response exceeded expectations and a 16-and-under squad was added into the mix after players from Plymouth and elsewhere around the South Shore signed up in large numbers for the program.
 The hope is to expand the program to five teams next year and there has also been discussion of holding some indoor training sessions over the winter if a suitable arrangement can be put together.
 "We were trying to come up with a way for some baseball players to get more college eyes on them after they lost this past spring high school season to the pandemic. It's not just the seniors that missed out when everything was canceled. This is also a big time for sophomore and juniors to learn and grow as players and maybe catch the eye of a college coach who'll remember them when it's time to move to the next level," Flynn explained. "The kids needed a chance to show what they can do and to work on their baseball skills.
 "The response has been amazing."
 The teams practice each Wednesday afternoon at either Forges Field or Siever Field in Plymouth. They'll either scrimmage locally on the weekends or travel around the state to play in several scheduled Firecracker or New England Baseball tournaments. Flynn works mainly with the pitchers, while Walsh helps players with their hitting and defense.
 Friends since their days of playing Plymouth Youth Football together, Flynn and Walsh were teammates on the 2008 Plymouth North baseball team that went on an undefeated run to the state championship. They played together for a national baseball title at Franklin Pierce University and each spent some time playing in the Cape Cod Baseball League with the Wareham Gatemen.
 Walsh ended his pro baseball career with a season in the New York Yankees organization and is now an associate head coach and recruiting coordinator with the Franklin Pierce baseball program. Flynn works full-time as a Plymouth firefighter.
 They've also recruited some friends to help them out. Former Plymouth North and UMass Boston standout David Murphy coaches the 16-year-old team and FPU teammates Ryan Boswell and Marc Roche also lend a hand with the training sessions.
 After spending time under the learning tree of Plymouth North's Dwayne Follette and former Franklin Pierce Head Coach Jayson King, Walsh and Flynn seem more than ready to pass along some of their acquired knowledge onto the next generation of baseball players.
 "I think I get more nervous coaching games than I did as a player, but I enjoy passing along some of the things that have been taught to me over the years," Flynn said. "I was lucky enough to have a lot of great coaches help me along the way."
 Spots are still open if you are interested in joining the J&M Baseball Academy. You can find more information on their website at jmbaseballacademy.weebly.com. They are also on Instagram (jmbaseball academy) and Facebook (J&M Baseball).

Amazon Inc. has no parallel in American history. Its grip on the economy and its reach into our personal lives is unprecedented.
 The biggest retailer in the United States, and the third-most-valuable company in the world, may now be coming to a vacant mall near you, filling the spots of the businesses it helped eviscerate.
 The e-commerce giant is reportedly in talks with Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall owner, to take over old J.C. Penney and Sears stores, two anchor establishments that have filed for bankruptcy. The irony of Amazon seeking to convert former retail chains into its own fulfillment centers can be lost on no one.
 Amazon wants space closer to where its customers live to get goods into their hands faster, and malls need tenants to replace bankrupt stores. On the face of it, all parties will benefit from such an agreement; however, the rise of Amazon has left a trail of devastation behind that cannot easily be measured.
 Amazon’s strategy of relentlessly low pricing brought it more customers and helped snuff out competitors, but this resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of retail jobs across America, along with the devastation of communities that these small businesses supported.
 In our pre-coronavirus world, the virtue of commerce was that it brought people together. Amazon’s e-commerce model severed these exchanges from human interaction and place. What do we lose with Amazon’s one-click shopping model? Casual encounters with friends and strangers, and the trust that develops from looking people in the eyes during these interactions.
 Yes, vacant land not generating taxes for municipalities is an objectively bad thing, and the jobs that will come with the opening of fulfillment centers should be celebrated; however, what’s going to happen to these jobs (40% of Amazon’s warehouse workers are temporary) as AI develops and the company creates robots, driverless cars and unmanned drones to deliver its packages?
 Although these fulfillment centers will not attract the foot traffic that malls once did, they’ll help pay the bills, and in today’s economy, that is no small thing. However, these spaces were once vibrant centers of commerce filled with music and people, and now they will be warehouses where boxes are packed — and that is a lamentable thought.

The black adopted son of liberal white parents stirs up trouble with deft alacrity in this absorbing film, which shares with its enigmatic protagonist the desire and dexterity to push people’s buttons. Played with cryptic charisma by Kelvin Harrison Jr, the eponymous Luce is a former child soldier who was pulled out of a war zone in Eritrea at the age of seven to be raised in comfort in the US by well-meaning, well-heeled couple Amy (Naomi Watts) and Peter Edgar (Tim Roth). Ten years later, he is his high school’s star pupil, a skilled debater and a talented athlete to boot. ‘I’m a poster boy,’ he says, mockingly. ‘A black kid who overcame his tragic past.’ He does, however, have a prickly relationship with his exacting history teacher, Harriet Wilson, played by Octavia Wilson. And when she asks her class to write an essay in the voice of a historical figure, he picks the 20th-century political philosopher of decolonisation from Martinique, Frantz Fanon, notoriously an advocate of revolutionary violence. Is he simply fulfilling the teacher’s brief or expressing his own beliefs? Like Luce himself, director Julius Onah’s film keeps us guessing, throwing in white privilege and guilt, black identity and code-switching - and a bag of illegal fireworks – into the story’s combustible mix. This is very much a drama of ideas (it’s based on the play by JC Lee) and a whiff of the stage still clings to the characters’ intellectual tussling, but it is very well acted, endlessly stimulating and, at this present juncture, extremely timely.

Apologies to Pink Floyd, but experts agree kids do need some education. The nagging question is how best to provide it.
 Learning is supposed to resume in a matter of weeks, but tension abounds between the state, districts, teachers' unions, and parents about whether it's safe to return to the classroom and whether remote learning is an acceptable substitute.
 The state's two major unions - the Massachusetts Teachers Association and the American Federation of Teachers - want school buildings to remain shuttered, at least to start the year. But Gov. Charlie Baker said he "can't imagine" why most kids wouldn't be returning to school given the current status of the virus in Massachusetts.
 After creeping up and ringing some alarm bells, the statewide positive test rate is back down around 1.5 percent, which is the lowest it's been since widespread testing began.
 Baker has preached local control throughout much of the pandemic, and rolled out a new rubric last week for people, including school administrators, to make decisions based on what's happening in their own communities, not just across the state.
 But he also made clear where he comes down on the question of remote versus in-person schooling. He's had less to say about fall athletics, though his administration also warned this week that sports like football and basketball are inherently more risky than tennis.
 The administration deployed another "stoplight" system to track each city and town's progress in controlling COVID-19. The new color-coded maps of Massachusetts municipalities shade cities and towns "red," "yellow," or "green" based on the prevalence and spread of the coronavirus.
 The colors correlate to average new daily cases reported over the previous two weeks, with "green" towns reporting fewer than four daily cases per 100,000 people, and "red" towns reporting more than eight new cases a day for every 100,000 people.
 A fourth category - white - means a municipality has had fewer than five new cases reported in total over the past two weeks.
 "If you're in a green or a white community, I can't imagine a good reason not to go back, whether it's full-time or some sort of a hybrid, because for all intents and purposes you meet all the benchmarks that are being used across the country and across New England to make decisions about whether it's safe to go back to school," Baker said.
 The governor said that unlike remote learning in the spring, the start of a new school year means students starting new grades with teachers they don't know, and vice versa. Learning to read, he has said, is not a virtual exercise.
 The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education formalized the governor's position when it told the 305 green and yellow communities that the state expected them to prioritize in-person learning, though there's no consequence for disobedience.
 For 46 other communities, that is not their situation.
 In these higher-risk communities, the state has put together an inter-agency task force to offer assistance with testing, contact tracing and enforcement of public and private gathering size limits.
 The state said it will also help, if asked, with public awareness campaigns to remind people to stay focused.
 "We're making progress and have made progress in our fight, but we're seeing the effects of too many people letting their guard down and simply relaxing, get in the way of some of our continued move forward," Baker said.
 Eleven municipalities have been put in the most at-risk "red" category, including Chelsea, Everett, Lynn, Revere, Fall River, Granby, Holyoke, Hull, Lawrence, Saugus and Salem. Those cities and towns, Education Commissioner Jeff Riley said, should begin the year with remote instruction.
 Solving the school conundrum is not easy, but there was no controversy over what should happen with the Democratic National Convention this week, which was supposed to take place in Milwaukee before the pandemic.
 The DNC will be fully remote. Not even Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, will be there in person.
 U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren scored a Wednesday night speaking role at the virtual DNC, but it was not the time slot many of her supporters may have been hoping to see. Biden last week announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making the daughter of Indian and Jamaican parents the first Black woman to run on a major party presidential ticket. She will give her acceptance speech on Wednesday night.
 In picking Harris, Biden passed over Warren who was on the list of women the former vice president vetted for the job. But given the pressure on Biden to pick a woman of color, the outcome was not unexpected.
 "I don't worry about where she ends up or her influence on what happens during a Biden presidency. She's already proven they work together well, and she'll be a number one player wherever she is," said Gus Bickford, chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party.
 Some have Warren ticketed for the Treasury if Biden can topple President Donald Trump in November, while others think she could be more powerful in the Senate, especially if Democrats can regain control of that body.
 Regardless, there were probably more than a few eager Democrats who had to put their ambitions on ice, at least for now, as they wait to see whether a Senate seat opens up before 2024.
 The competition for the state's other Senate seat heated up, with U.S. Sen. Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III squaring off in their second- to-last debate before the Sept. 1 primary.
 Polling has shown the race to be tight, and after refusing to sign a pledge to keep outside money out of their race, Markey is now hammering Kennedy over the support he is receiving from a new super PAC that may, or may not, be funded in part by Kennedy's father, who himself was a congressman.
 Markey has also benefited from super PAC spending, which Kennedy's team is all too willing to point out.
 Things may be getting uglier in the Senate race, but not as ugly as they got last week out west where UMass College Democrats accused Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse, who is gay, of inappropriately contacting students through social media channels. Morse denies taking advantage of his position as a UMass lecturer to meet men, but says he won't apologize for using dating apps in his personal life.
 Some LGBTQ lawmakers like Sen. Julian Cyr have come to Morse's defense, suggesting a double standard in the face of unsubstantiated claims. Some reports have even suggested it may have been an orchestrated attempt to hurt Morse's campaign against U.S. Rep. Richard Neal, who has denied any involvement.
 The truth may be a bit blurred, but it's clear it's crunch time for a lot of campaigns as early voting is underway.
 Dave Cavell, the one-time speechwriter in the Obama White House who advised Attorney General Maura Healey before leaving her office to run for Congress, saw his time running out.
 Cavell suspended his campaign in the Fourth Congressional District, and endorsed Jesse Mermell. In doing so, Cavell not only talked up Mermell's progressive credentials, but said he it was a strategic move to avoid further splintering the vote in what's now an eight-person field in a way that could make it easier for Newton City Councilor Jake Auchincloss to win.
 Auchincloss has become the crowded field's favorite punching bag after the Boston Globe's editorial board endorsed his campaign, despite some controversial comments he's made in the past on social media.
 For instance, his rivals view his free-speech comparison between the Confederate Flag and Black Lives Matter banners as disqualifying. He has since called those comments a mistake.
 Cavell, however, was only the tip of the iceberg, because after he exited the race his former, and much better known, boss Healey also endorsed Mermell.
 The attention on the campaign trail last week is what August is usually like in an even-numbered year, even though this is no usual year and the Legislature extended its session beyond the traditional July 31 recess date.
 Legislative leaders suggested they would call lawmakers back into session this month if and when any of the conference committees negotiating policing, climate change, telehealth, economic development and transportation spending bills reached a deal.
 So far, that hasn't happened.
 Also this past week:
 The Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Vacationland voters should not be able to decide the fate of a transmission line needed to bring Canadian hydropower from Quebec to Massachusetts.
 Rep. Shawn Dooley, a Norfolk Republican, used Facebook as a platform to rail against "King Charles" and what he sees as the governor's trampling of the Constitution through executive orders aimed at controlling COVID-19, namely the conditions placed on travelers visiting from places like Rhode Island.
 Supreme Judicial Court Justice Barbara Lenk decided to postpone her planned retirement from August to December when she actually bumps up against the mandatory retirement age of 70, giving Baker more time to seek out qualified, and diverse, applicants for his sixth nomination to the top court.

Batman’s cackling archenemy the Joker gets his own big-screen origin story. And it’s no laughing matter. Controversial and divisive, director Todd Phillips’ nightmarish drama departs from Hollywood’s usual comic-book playbook to deliver a disturbingly compelling movie; one that has more in common with films of the late 1970s and early 1980s – notably Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - than with the current DC universe. Famously, Joaquin Phoenix lost three stone to play the film’s mentally fragile central character, Arthur Fleck – and reaped a Best Actor Oscar for his pains. Living in the film’s grim, grotty version of Gotham City circa 1981, Arthur is an oddball loner who works as a party clown by day and cares for his sick mother at night. He also suffers from a Tourette’s-like affliction that causes him to burst into uncontrollable laughter. He dreams, however, of emulating his TV idol, talk-show host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro in an ironic echo of his role in The King of Comedy), and becoming an adored stand-up comedian himself. Arthur’s subsequent journey takes him through street beatings and mental breakdown, and sees him adopted as the figurehead of an anti-rich street movement before we get hints of the future Joker of comic- book legend. Repellent and pitiful at the same time, Phoenix is absolutely riveting, his fearless performance a world away from Cesar Romero’s campy shtick in the 1960s TV series and every bit the equal of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger’s scene stealing turns in Batman and The Dark Knight. Like Phoenix, the film is often tough to watch – but always thrilling.
