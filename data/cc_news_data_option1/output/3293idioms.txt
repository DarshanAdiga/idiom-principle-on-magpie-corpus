 Rollback reopening plans in MA. With far too many people esp. those in their mid 20's to late 30's, when given an inch, they took a yard. Imagine only a $600 fine for The Colonial in Gardner, MA for 2 days of allowing gatherings of 200+/- guests, yet get caught dining, beaching, or shopping in an adjacent state w/o quarantining for 14 days and get slapped w/a $500 fine!

 Massachusetts should rollback to Stage 2. It's not safe for people to be inside with other folks since the virus is airborne. People should not be dying to save the economy.

 We should not reopen the schools this fall based on the latest upticks and the danger to the teachers and students. The states should have been planning for this months ago instead of the last few weeks of summer bringing great uncertainty for parents and teachers and students.

 Before rolling back, we should discuss the costs of the restrictions which really has [not] been done yet. How many more people have died because of lack of medical and mental health care from heart attacks, strokes, suicides, drug overdoses, etc; how many women and children in abusive homes are not getting the help they need; how many people have lost their jobs and businesses and are now or in the future will suffer huge financially loss; how many elderly who are living alone who lost their services are suffering severe depression; what is the traumatic effect on young children and teens from isolation; do we know what the long-term health effects are on a continued lock down: spread of tuberculosis, legionnaires disease, foregoing mammograms, colonoscopies, dentist, compromised immune systems especially in children. What are the medical and psychological effects of prolonged long-time (hours a day) mask wearing such as an increase carbon dioxide into the system, claustrophobia, dermatological rashes; and what is the economic damage in the years to come from loss of businesses and jobs, loss of revenue for governments, substantially increased debt and deficit; and what is the societal damage from engaging and advocating for social distance shaming and from demonizing people especially young teens and adults; have we created a dystopia we can come back from. Whether we roll back or even continue the strict restrictions is up for discussion, but we shouldn't make the decision without first acknowledging the damage that we are causing. It's not as easy as shut it all down. Let's look at both sides with equally as one doesn't happen without the other.
 Mary Ann Cady   Yarmouth, Mass.
 Yes. Experts all along have said we need to choose whether to reopen schools OR retail and bars .We already chose .Allowing both will provide too many avenues for the virus to spread.

 No & no. These new cases mean nothing. Sure people might be getting it but they are NOT being hospitalized for it and they are surely NOT dying. It's just like the flu now. We get it, but it's not life threatening to the majority of us. The elderly and people with compromised immune systems should still take every precaution imaginable. Just like they would with the flu.

They repeated this process over and over again, and attempted to defraud Amazon to the tune of about $32 million, according to the Department of Justice, which announced the arrests Wednesday. They successfully netted $19 million.
 According to the indictment, the brothers also allegedly gloated about their scheme in messages to each other on WhatsApp. At one point, one defendant wrote to his brothers, "I'm so in the mood to fuck Amazon," and asked, "Did anyone try to overship and make a million profit in a week?"
 The arrests are part of Amazon's stepped up efforts to fight against alleged scammers who try to defraud its businesses and customers. The company in June started its Counterfeit Crimes Unit to sue alleged counterfeiters, and it's spent the past few years suing other alleged scammers who have targeted its e-book business and Alexa customers.
 The four brothers are Yoel Abraham, 28, of Suffern; Heshl Abraham, 32, of Spring Valley; Zishe Abraham, 30, of Spring Valley; and Shmuel Abraham, 24, of Airmont. They were each charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and money laundering carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.
 "While our proactive controls ensure the vast majority of sellers in our store are honest entrepreneurs, fraudsters attempt to violate our policies, victimize our customers, and damage our store," Cristina Posa, associate general counsel and director of the Amazon Counterfeit Crimes Unit, said in a statement Wednesday night, "and we look forward to working with law enforcement agencies to hold these bad actors accountable for their illegal activities."

 "We wanted to make sure we had a great representation of diverse voices from across different industries and disciplines," Davis said.
 "We could have cast Shakespearean actors, classically trained actors, who could really dig into the iambic pentameter of the text - and we do have a few of them. But we also wanted to increase representation from educators, poets, visual artists, musicians, public officials. And that's the list that we have. We've got a great group of people from many walks of life, a diverse representation of backgrounds and perspectives."
 As one of the classically trained actors on the roster, Barsoumian said he is looking forward to participating in the epic project, which he joined through his connections with Davis, whom he befriended at a wedding.
