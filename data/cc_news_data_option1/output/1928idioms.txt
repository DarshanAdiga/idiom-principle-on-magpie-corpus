The coronavirus has infected over 4.6 million people and killed more than 314,000 worldwide, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts say under counts the true toll of the pandemic. The U.S. has reported over 89,000 dead and Europe has seen at least 160,000 deaths.

What is missing, for now, at KSDS is the station’s dedicated on-air staff, which in pre-coronavirus days (and nights) hosted a combined 17 different shows each weekend alone and another 16 on weekdays.
 Like Fox, many KSDS hosts qualify as walking jazz encyclopedias. Their depth of knowledge is matched by their passion for sharing the music with listeners in San Diego and, online at jazz88.org, around the world. The station receives annual funding from the San Diego Community College District.
 “KSDS is a flagship jazz radio station that has been won multiple awards at a national level, and it’s huge that they have continued broadcasting during the pandemic,” said Mark Rini, a partner at the 29-year-old independent jazz radio album promotion firm Groove Marketing in Washington.
 “Not every station has been able to do that. It’s taken some stations a month or more to get back up (on air) and jazz radio has taken a hit. I think people are just figuring out how to adapt. With jazz radio, there are a lot of technophobes — old programming directors — who are resistant to taking digital delivery of music and still want CDs. So I’ve been impressed by how many stations have now implemented a ‘Plan B’.”

Heather J. Barnett, Branch Manager of Barnett Financial Partners, Inc. associated with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, in Keokuk, has been recognized as one of "America's Top Women Advisors" by Forbes.
   
 This accolade represents a list of professionals who come to work with one goal on their mind -- helping their clients succeed.
   
 "It's an honor to be named among America's top women advisors, as determined by Forbes," said Barnett. "It seems a common misperception that to get 'expert' advice, one needs to go to a 'big city'. I hope this accolade is a testament to the fact that one doesn't have to go out of their way to receive the financial guidance and advice that you want and deserve."
   
 Barnett has been a financial advisor with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network and its predecessor firms for 24 years and she has 26 years of experience in the brokerage industry. She has been a certified financial planner since 2006. She holds a master of science in business administration with a concentration in finance from University of Wisconsin-Madison
   
 Barnett lives in Hamilton, Illinois, with her husband, Ryan, and their two sons, Tanner and Brayden.

It almost feels as though the show could last for another season if things continue to heat up, or maybe more if the ratings don't keep dropping as they've been doing since season 3. Even with this in mind however Riverdale has still been one of the most popular shows around for a while and there's a lot of hope that it could heat up a bit as things continue to move along. The show has had to kind of change and adapt as things have moved forward, especially after the passing of Luke Perry, and now with the onset of the pandemic. How this current virus will impact the show in the long run has yet to be seen but like every other series out there people are wanting to see this one return for several reasons, many of which have to do with their own personal desire to see their favorite characters or see how things play out in Riverdale as they've been going along at a pretty good clip and could eventually become a story that we'll be writing about for months to come. Hannah Shaw-Williams of Screenrant has more to say on this. While it doesn't feel as though the show might create the same level of interest as others when it comes to random fan theories and the kind of outrage that happens when something unexpected comes along, Riverdale is still the type of show that people tend to talk and gossip about now and again just to make sure that they're seeing the same things that others are when it comes to the story line.

El asunto viene a colación tras una serie de especulaciones sobre su real valor en el mercado y la posibilidad que tiene Flooentino Pérez de recuperar algo de los 80 millones de euros que pagó por él en 2014. Es cierto que en un par de años, y producto de su eficiencia para vender productos de mercadeo, el jugador amortizó hace rato la inversión. Pero el jefe 'merengue' es un hombre de negocios y no va a perder la opción de ganar algo más, justo ahora en la crisis por el coronavirus covid-19. ¿A cuánto aspira? Esa es la cuestión.      El diario The Sun soltó en las últimas horas que Newcastle, que tendría en la mira a Gareth Bale, podría ir por el colombiano pero por una cifra máxima de 32 millones de euros. Sería su plan B. Pero para eso requiere que el millonario árabe que pretende comprar el clubes finalmente llegue, lo que no es tan fácil pues varios presidentes de la Premier se oponen a una financiación estatal que desequilibre la competencia. Sería, eso si, el único equipo con músculo financiero para salir de compras en verano pues los demás pasan angustias.      Son demasiadas coincidencias y en Everton, de Ancelotti, tampoco hay rastros de querer pujar por el zurdo. En fin. Ojo, que la primera cifra es 32 millones.

What concerns us is that the GOP legislators who brought the lawsuit had asked the justices to stay their ruling for about a week so legislators and Evers could work out a new plan to deal with the pandemic. But the court did not do so. Neither did it put any of its own guidelines in place. Businesses are able to operate without requiring facemasks, hand-sanitizing or social-distancing, if they so choose.
 We have supported the “Safer-at-Home” orders during this pandemic, not because of partisan politics, but because of public health. We are extremely concerned about the financial well-being of local businesses and residents, including the Daily Union and its employees. However, flareups are being reported in places where safety precautions grew lax.
 The Daily Union’s office door will remain locked until we feel confident that our contact with the public, and vice-versa, likely will not end up with someone becoming ill, or worse.
 So we ask readers to please act responsibly while being out and about in the coming days and weeks. The coronavirus isn’t going away just because four people in black robes hope it will. Its spread continues to depend on each and every one of us using our own best judgement.

- Expected to arrive next year as MY2022- Could be based on Alfa Romeo derived platformJeep’s current Grand Cherokee has been on sale for almost a decade now. The current WK2 generation is soon to be replaced by a fifth-generation model and with the new-gen, the SUV will also get a three-row version for the first time. Our spy sleuths caught an early prototype of the three-row Grand Cherokee outside the carmaker’s headquarters in Michigan.According to reports, the new-gen Grand Cherokee will make use of FCA’s new platform which will debut with the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. This long- wheelbase version will be positioned between the standard Grand Cherokee and the new upcoming flagship Wagoneer and should measure around the same as the Dodge Durango. With more space on the inside, the three-row Grand Cherokee will surely not leave Jeep’s off-road credentials behind. In fact, we expect it to get the renowned ‘Trail Rated Trackhawk’ version as well.In terms of powertrain, it will get the usual line-up of Pentastar V6. The 3.0-litre motor mated to eTorque plug-in hybrid system which also powers the Ram 1500 will put around 250bhp and 500Nm. This electrified powertrain will replace the mammoth 5.7-litre Hemi V8. A turbodiesel engine is also on the cards but won’t be available at the time of launch.In terms of competition, the three-row Grand Cherokee will go head-to-head against the Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer apart from Range Rover and Lincoln Navigator. We expect it to arrive sometime next year as an MY2022.

IOWA CITY -- Iowa has rebuilt its stockpile of personal protective equipment after a dire shortage that prompted the state to buy through unusual sources, including $7 million in contracts for gowns and goggles with a business known for making Republican campaign signs.
   
 Iowa's executive branch signed $45 million worth of emergency purchase orders for isolation gowns, masks, face shields, goggles and other equipment from mid-March through April, documents obtained by The Associated Press show.
   
 The deals include 590,000 masks that were purchased directly from China and several with businesses that have never before supplied such materials.
   
 In three contracts worth $7.2 million, the state agreed to purchase 1 million isolation gowns and 100,000 clear plastic goggles through Competitive Edge Inc., a Des Moines business that has never sold either. The company supplies promotional items like T-shirts, and has long been a go-to vendor for Republican campaigns buying yard and barn signs.
   
 Owner David Greenspon, a former Republican appointee on the Iowa Finance Authority board, said state agencies reached out unsolicited asking for help securing supplies from China because he has long imported from there. Now Greenspon said he's overseeing manufacturing in three Chinese factories and the items will be delivered to Iowa over the next month.
   
 "We were lucky enough to get some business. I am happy about that. I like to be busy," he said. "It's been a tough few months but we didn't close through any of it. Maybe that was fortuitous. When somebody from the state called, we were here."
   
 Greenspon is charging the state $6.96 per gown and $2.59 for each pair of goggles. He said neither item will be medical grade.
   
 The contracts didn't have to go through the mandatory open bidding process. Gov. Kim Reynolds suspended those requirements for all goods and services needed to fight the coronavirus in a March 9 emergency proclamation.
   
 The governor said Friday the state has started to receive orders that were placed in March, allowing its inventory to be rebuilt. "Our stockpile is in a good place right now," Reynolds said.
   
 Executive branch spokeswoman Tami Wiencek said Iowa has ordered 33.6 million items since February and received more than half of them. She said orders for 1 million other items were cancelled after the vendor could not fulfill them on the state's timeline.
   
 A spreadsheet obtained by the AP shows Iowa's inventory includes 8.8 million surgical masks, 664,000 face shields, 356,000 respirators, 1.3 million gloves, and 67,000 isolation gowns. But a shortage of goggles still exists.
   
 These figures do not include millions of additional items the Iowa National Guard has delivered to all 99 counties. The situation has improved since the pandemic arrived in Iowa two months ago amid a national shortage of supplies, alarming health care officials.
   
 On March 22, a top Iowa Department of Public Health official emailed University of Iowa experts asking whether used protective equipment could be disinfected by UV light or chemicals and reworn.
   
 Ken Sharp, Iowa's director of acute disease prevention, emergency response and environmental health, also asked them to brainstorm "what 'off the wall' solutions may be viable" if traditional equipment was unavailable.
   
 "I realize these sound like desperate questions, but we are planning in unusual times and need to give consideration to all potential options," Sharp wrote in the email, obtained by the AP.
   
 On April 10, his department declared a shortage of personal protective equipment and directed health care providers to use face masks for treating multiple patients, use washable gowns and shorten hospital stays to preserve respirators. Supplies that were beyond their expiration dates could also be used.
   
 That order remains in effect. Some health care workers report having trouble finding adequate supplies despite the replenished state stockpile.
   
 It's unclear whether taxpayers are getting good value for their money. Contracts show the state has paid vastly different prices for similar products.
   
 In March, the state purchased 400, 8 ounce bottles of hand sanitizer from an out-of-state vendor for $4.69 apiece. Then in April, the state signed a contract with an Iowa company to produce hand sanitizer for a fraction of that cost: $10 apiece per 128 ounce bottles.
   
 The state has paid between $4.64 and $19.35 for each isolation gown. Goggles have ranged from $1.12 apiece to $2.85. And disposable face shields have varied from $1.25 apiece to $3.
   
 The state purchased 590,000 face shields directly from a Chinese exporter for $938,000, or $1.59 per shield. That shipment was to be flown from China to an Ankeny food warehouse, a March 27 purchasing order shows.
   
 The state is buying 100,000 disposable face shields for $3 apiece from Honeycorr Acquisition LLC, a Fairfield packing and distribution company that had never made them before. CEO Nate Weaton said the $3 price was fair, saying similar items have been marketed for $5 or $7.
   
 "We wanted a cost-competitive and cost-conscientious product and to make sure we weren't gouging," he said. "We think that's where we ended up."

Later this summer, Carousel Productions will once again be producing three musicals as part of their Summer Youth Theatre Program at the Brass Ring Center for the Performing Arts. This year's season will consist of the youngest performers in "WIlly Wonka Kids," the older youth in "Moana Jr.," and high school students in "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."
   
 While all three musicals are currently slated to go on as scheduled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there will be a few new policies and procedures put in place this year to protect the children's health. Vicki Gelona, artistic director for Carousel Productions, said the changes will begin with auditions which will take place via video instead of in person.
   
 "Typically, when we have an audition for one of the shows there are somewhere between 150 to 160 people that come into the building when you include all the parents and siblings," Gelona said. "So we're going to do everything via video because we don't have such a massive footprint inside the building before we even start."
   
 Gelona said children interested in auditioning can find all the information about each show by visiting www.brassringardmore.com and clicking on Summer Youth Theater near the top right of the website. From there, students can click on the link for their age group and find an explanation about what they need to do for the audition
   
 "It will have all the character types and the lines from the show that they will need to read with a partner or parent," Gelona said. "The songs they have to sing for the audition will be up on our Brass Ring YouTube page, and they can play the songs from there and sing along."
   
 Additional precautions will be taken during rehearsals and performances to help prevent the spread of the virus. In the application packet, parents will be required to sign a document that will allow the requirement of masks during rehearsals. Gelona said the theater will be supplying reusable masks.
   
 "We'll take those up at the end of every day to wash them and make sure they're clean when the kids come back the next day," Gelona said. "There's also a provision in the application that allows us to take their temperature before they come into the building."
   
 A designated parent or a student instructor will be taking temperatures with a no-touch thermometer before anyone is allowed into the building. Anyone with a temperature of 99.5 or higher will not be allowed inside.
   
 Another difference this year is that parents, friends and siblings will not be able to come inside during rehearsals. At the end of the day student instructors will walk the children outside to their parents' vehicles.
   
 "We just want to err on the side of caution with everything we do, and we want to do our best to ensure that everyone stays healthy and happy," Gelona said.
   
 Even the performances themselves will likely be a little unique because the audience sizes will be limited due to social distancing guidelines. To help make sure everyone who wants to see the performances gets the opportunity, Gelona said they are planning to stream the performances online.
   
 She said masks will be incorporated into the costumes of the youngest group of performers.
   
 "They'll be wearing the masks in the show as well," Gelona said. "It might sound a little different than it usually does, but an Oompa Loompa can wear a mask!"
   
 Information packets for all three musicals will be posted to the Brass Ring's website. Videos are due by 10 p.m. on Friday, May 22. Summer Youth Theatre is underwritten by private individuals, so it is free to those who participate. Those interested in performing in the ensemble and not auditioning for a role are only required to submit a signed application and do not have to send in a video.

Riverdale wasn't the only show that was forced to stop a season early due to the coronavirus, but what that means for season 5 is that things are going to change in a very monumental way a Marianne Garvey of CNN has already stated, and that could mean that things are going to get shaken up in a very big way that a lot of people won't expect. One thing to expect is a time jump according to a few sources since as of right now it's up in the air when production is even going to be starting up on anything, let alone just one project. The time jump will apparently make sense considering where season 4 was at however and it will manage to put a different spin on the story in a way that a lot of fans should be able to appreciate. It does sound as though season 5 will seek to wrap up the last part of season 4 so as to make some kind of sense and let everything fall in line. Then the next season will begin with its time jump that sees the main characters having attended college and gone on to graduate before finding a reason that brings them back to Riverdale. It's fair to say that the Archie comics never really prepared anyone for this show from the start since despite bringing in a lot of familiar characters the TV show has definitely gone forward with a much edgier and less recognizable plot than many of the comics ever had.

Bea Markow just turned 100 on May 4, and she has seen a lot in her life, but nothing quite like the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 She doesn't recall anything in her 100 years being "so overall terrible."
   
 "I've never seen anything like it -- it's just ridiculous," she said. "I've never heard of anything like this ... it's really a very, very serious situation ... it's just very, very frightening."
   
 The pandemic prompted the cancellation of her 100th birthday party, which was scheduled for early May. In lieu of a party, the Phoenix Fire Department and several community members organized a surprise appearance as Markow watched from her balcony. It was a feel-good event that was covered by several local news outlets.
   
 It's all right that the party had to be changed, she said, because it's too "risky" to not follow recommendations like wearing a mask or practicing social distancing.
   
 "It's important that we just follow every rule that we have to try to get this period over with -- I hope I live to see that day."
   
 Markow said she's hardly left her room since the outbreak began, and that the only in-person communication she has is with her "wonderful" caregiver.
   
 She said she hasn't been lonely, though, adding that as of May 12 she was still reading the more than 100 birthday cards that she received.
   
 Reading those cards reminded her of why she believes she's been able to live so long.
   
 "They say, 'you are nice to people, you understand people, you always try to help,'" she said. "I think if people enjoyed themselves more, were happier, they would be a lot better off."
   
 She's also kept herself "very, very busy" with phone calls from loved ones.
   
 "I'm very fortunate -- I have a lot of friends," she said.
   
 She does miss the simple things, though. Markow told The Republic she looks forward to going downstairs and joining her fellow residents for dinner.
   
 Bea Markow,born in 1920, was the third child and first girl in a Russian- Jewish household in a Brooklyn tenement.
   
 She was a "cherished" child who was the valedictorian of her high school class, her 72-year-old daughter Gayle Markow said.
   
 Bea remembers the Great Depression as a "difficult time," though she said it was then that she secured her first job, a $12-per-week stint with a small publishing company.
   
 After five years, she got a job with Superman comics where she answered fan letters as Lois Lane for $25 per week.
   
 She met her graphic artist husband, Bob Markow, while at a Phoenix convention and ultimately moved to the city and married him in 1943.
   
 Bob went into the military and eventually became the base photographer at Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale.
   
 After his service, the couple went into business together with Markow Photography. They also started Colormark Custom Photo Lab, which The East Valley Tribune reported was the Valley's first custom photo lab, and Markow photo supply stores.
   
 Though Bob Markow was the face of the business, Gayle Markow said her mother was tireless in her behind-the-scenes work to support their ventures.
   
 "She was self-effacing in public but she was a powerhouse," Gayle said. "She was always a powerhouse in anything she did."
   
 Bob died in 2009, and Gayle Markow recalls her mother refusing to leave the home they shared for the first year afterward.
   
 Eventually, she moved into The Palazzo assisted living facility in Phoenix, where Gayle Markow said her mother flourished and quickly made new friends.
   
 Gayle Markow and her sister had been planning a large celebration with over 100 guests, an event that was canceled once the pandemic hit.
   
 Though Bea Markow said she was "disappointed" that she couldn't physically be with all of her children on her special day, she said she wouldn't have wanted them to take risks with their health by traveling for the occasion.
   
 She still had a spectacular birthday, though.
   
 News outlets, including The Republic, wrote about Markow's 100th birthday on May 4 that included a visit from the Phoenix Fire Department and a slew of masked people waving to her from the street below.
   
 Markow said her son even made an appearance on the fireman's ladder, which added to how "overwhelmed" she felt.
   
 "I can't describe it -- it was just too much," she said. "It was just so wonderful to see and so out of the question ... it's really something that happens once in a lifetime."
   
 Markow said if she could offer one message to those younger than her, it would be one of self-care.
   
 "It pays to take care of yourself," she said. "You have one life to live. Take care of yourself and be good to yourself."

So far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it’s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.

Whitney-Sidney is a good-sized lead guard with extra length that makes him a more than capable two-way weapon at the point of attack. He is super skilled and possesses a tremendous feel for the game, along with quality vision and passing abilities that he relies upon in knifing up the defense with the pass on the go.
 He is at his best off the bounce where he has no issues getting his defender on skates via the change of speed dribble, but has the requisite breakdown abilities off the first step. He is a sneaky athlete at the basket and is a very effective playmaker that makes others around him better.
 Bringing quality quickness and instincts to the point guard position, Whitney- Sidney is a serviceable jump shooter to the perimeter that can hit with a contested hand in his face. Thanks to his size, he can play in multiple ballhandling units that might ask him to act more as a scorer rather than as a facilitator first. However, he is at his best whenever the ball is placed into his hands and displays value as an on the ball defender that can shut down an opposing unit’s best perimeter scorer.
 Questions remain as to whether a travel season will begin but, either way, it is difficult to dispute the abilities of Whitney-Sidney. The 2021 class is not one that is known for great depth at the lead guard spot which is why it wouldn’t come as a surprise if another group of high-majors entered his recruitment.

PANAMA CITY BEACH -- Youth sporting events will soon be up and running once again.
   
 In a Thursday meeting, the Panama City Beach City Council voted to allow city club teams to resume practice at Frank Brown Park on May 16 in preparation for tournaments to begin starting June 1.
   
 "The kids have been affected enough in the past two years (with what) they've been through in our community," said Mayor Mark Sheldon. "If we can bring back some sort of sanity and (normalcy), that would be phenomenal."
   
 Sheldon, along with Councilman Geoff McConnell, also liked the idea of offering an amended summer or fall baseball and softball season to make up for spring cancellations.
   
 "I'd really like to be able to recapture that if possible," McConnell said. "We'd like to get the kinds out ... of the house again and moving.
   
 "... I think that it's going to be good for our community and the people who live here to be able to get out and get some baseball and other youth activities going again," he added.
   
 With kids currently out of school, McConnell believed it would be best if the amended seasons started as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the fall.
   
 Sheldon hoped to find a way to fit the seasons into the park's upcoming schedule.
   
 "Anyway we can get creative and try to give something back to the youth of our community is very important," he said.
   
 Also discussed during the meeting was a list of summer camps, which will begin July 1. They include: group swim lessons, mermaid camp, diving, volleyball, surfing, tennis, sewing, cooking, golf, basketball, baseball, soccer, kid exercise camp and ping pong. All will be limited to 10 or less participants, apart from group swim lessons, which will have a four-person cap.
   
 The Panama City Beach Community Center and Lyndell Center are also set to reopen May 16.
   
 According to Sheldon, hospital beds in Bay and Walton counties are currently at about 70% capacity.
   
 "Looking at those statistics ... makes me more comfortable with opening these things up," Sheldon said.

Those guys are hungry for NFL spots, it's really up to them. The guys we can acquire here in the next 24 hours as rookie free agents, they're going to have to take the training very seriously, so they hit the ground running.

KSDS, fortuitously, did not have to institute a “Plan B,” hastily or otherwise.
 In November 2014, prior to the station’s move into its new and larger studios at City College, Fox began an automation process to digitize the station’s entire CD music library. The process required him to program KSDS remotely for a month, until the station completed its move and resumed live broadcasting. In April 2015, he trained all the other KSDS on-air hosts to use the new ENCO digital software.
 Fox now is using that software to create his remotely programmed playlists, just as his fellow KSDS hosts would for their live shows when they had access to the station’s studios.
 “I am cognizant of maintaining a balance that incorporates a good portion of the ‘hits,’ if you will,” he said. “Those include either individual songs or selections from memorable albums, such as Dave Brubeck’s ‘Take Five,’ Miles Davis’ ‘So What,’ Duke Ellington’s ‘Take The “A” Train’ and Thelonious Monk’s ‘Round Midnight,’ and frequent selections by artists like John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Stan Getz, Bill Evans and more.”
 Fox now visits the studios at City College once a week to reset the servers that operate KSDS’s equipment and to perform a unique rebuild on the station’s ENCO system. He also makes sure the air-conditioning is working optimally — a key factor for any radio station packed with computers and broadcast equipment.
