The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes of California, revealed last month that Trump and his campaign aides might have been swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign targets during the presidential election. What's more, he charged, the White House may have inappropriately asked intelligence agencies to reveal the identities of the Trump aides so that the Obama team could keep tabs on them.

 Lundmark said that over the past six years, salary increases have been fixed dollar amounts, so a first-year teacher would receive the same amount as a 10- or 30-year teacher.
 Under this system, the raise percentages have been “all over the place,” she said. For some teachers, their year-to-year increase was as low as 2 percent.
 “We’re just not on par with our neighboring districts who were getting 3 or 4 or more percent raises every year,” she said.
 The union is also asking to maintain current insurance benefits in the new contract, she said.
 Additionally, the union is asking for common plan time to be fixed into all teachers’ schedules.
 Common plan time is time set aside in the day teachers use to collaborate on common assessments, plans and lessons.
 While upper grade teachers have this time built into their daily schedules, the elementary teachers have it about once a week, and it’s not contractually guaranteed, Lundmark said.
 “We’re looking to put that in place for all of our teachers to benefit from,” she said. “Ultimately, we know that’s what’s best for our students, when teachers have time to put their heads together and plan together.”

As the kids looked on in astonishment, the miniscule little men reportedly crawled down a hole and the miniature craft they had ridden in just sort of vanished into thin air. When the boys went to investigate, they say they found a small burnt patch of grass, but nothing more. The schoolkids excitedly told their headmaster about the strange encounter, and soon more reports would emerge of similar creatures in the area.
