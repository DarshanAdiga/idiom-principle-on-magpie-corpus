Boyd, from Houston, Texas, was the team’s leading rusher for the second consecutive season, totaling 1,133 yards on 184 carries, scoring eight times in 2019. He ranked fourth in the SEC and 27th nationally with an average of 94.4 rushing yards per game and ninth in the conference with 6.2 yards per carry. He ran for 100+ yards in five games, posting a season-high 185 yards against Western Kentucky on Nov. 9, his most rushing yards as a Razorback. His five 100+ yard performances brought him to a total of eight over two years, making him one of 16 Arkansas running backs in school history to do so. Boyd also hauled in 160 yards through the air on 19 catches in 2019.

 A private funeral service was conducted Sunday for Shaune W. Lewis, the Kewanee High School boys basketball coach who died July 2, leaving a wife and a son. Pastor Stephen McGough conducted the service.
 The funeral culminated three days of remembrances and memorials for the man fondly remembered as \"Coach Lew.\" Memorials continued to be posted on social media, celebrating his contributions to the community as a supporter of KHS athletics and as a businessman at Lewis Auto Body Shop.
 Lewis, who had been head varsity coach for five seasons, went 93-60, winning Class 2A regionals in 2016 and 2017. Last season's team went 27-5, winning the Colomone Classic, taking second in the Marseilles holiday tournament and winning the Three Rivers Conference East Division title. It was the most wins by a KHS team since Mike Kirkham's 1986 team went 27-4 and reached the state Class A quarterfinals.
 Lewis died July 2 at age 47 at a Davenport hospital after experiencing a medical episode while behind the wheel during a preliminary late model race at Davenport Speedway. A lifelong motorsports enthusiast, Lewis raced his No. 44X at both Davenport and at Rock Island's Bullring.
 On Friday night at Davenport Speedway, the IMCA SportMods feature race from July 2 that was postponed from that evening was run as a tribute. Lewis was credited for placing 25th, while Justin Kay of Wheatland, Iowa, was the winner.
 On Saturday morning and afternoon, a public visitation was held at the KHS Auditorium.
 Kewanee High School sports fans, lifelong friends and fellow coaches arrived to offer condolences to the family.
 The lobby of the auditorium was filled with mementos from Lewis' coaching and racing career, as well as photos from his family life. His racing helmet was on display.
 A large photograph of him coaching in the KHS huddle met the visitors as the line snaked around tables filled with other items.
 Visitors were asked to leave messages of remembrance on construction paper basketballs. Near the guest register there was a collection box for donations to a college fund for his surviving son, Blaise, an incoming freshman at KHS.
 The auditorium stage was adorned with basketballs while a photograph slideshow played overhead, the school's logo and mascot were projected on the wall.
 Surviving family members, including Shaune's wife, Rhonda, and his parents, Richard and Diana Lewis of Kewanee, his brother Chad and his sister MacKenzee wore orange shirts -- the color of the family business as well as the school -- while greeting well-wishers and exchanged hugs with close friends.
 Lewis was born Feb. 28, 1973, in Kewanee. He graduated from Kewanee High School in 1991 and attended Black Hawk College. He played basketball on teams coached by Jim Peck. He married Rhonda Kersey on Oct. 7, 2000, having been together since 1991.
 Lewis' coaching career stretched 25 years, going back to leading teams at Central Junior High. He was a referee for many years. He then coached the underclassman teams at KHS before being promoted to varsity assistant. He was named head coach in 2015.

Schools will open for in-person instruction under an updated Plan B that requires face coverings for all K-12 students, fewer children in the classroom, measures to ensure social distancing for everyone in the building, and other safety protocols.

Like every summer, Marblehead Harbor is busy with boaters, but this year there are some new rules to protect people from COVID-19.
 "The safety of the public is the biggest concern for me," Harbormaster Mark Souza told The Marblehead Reporter.
 So, if you are headed to the harbor, here are some important things to know:
 People on all town docks and piers are required to wear face coverings and maintain social distancing at all times.
 On gangways, people returning from sea should be allowed to pass first, with masks and six feet of social distancing. Then, once the gangway is clear, people coming from land can pass onto the dock.
 Docks and piers can only have 10 people at a time and no loitering is allowed.
 Vessels can never be left unattended during tie-up (which is limited to 30 minutes).
 "If a boat needs to be moved, there could be COVID contamination. We want the owner of the boat to be there," Souza said.
 The State Street North dock (closest to The Landing Restaurant) is designated for commercial use only. State Street South dock is for general use.
 If any personal protective equipment is left behind and not properly disposed of, Souza says he'll have to close the area.
 The Crocker Park dock, a popular spot for kids who like to jump off and swim, is not open.
 "That dock on any given Saturday can have 20-30 kids on it and that doesn't deem proper for social distancing, so we're holding off on that," Souza said. "That wasn't an easy decision to make, but it's an extremely unsafe environment."
 It seems many boaters are taking the new rules in stride.
 "Everybody is just so happy to be out of the house and doing something outside, all the other stuff is falling by the wayside," said Brendan Sheehan, who runs Mid-Harbor Launch off the Village Street pier.
 "I don't want to be the guy who gets everybody sick," Sheehan said. "We're following all the rules."
 Mid-Harbor Launch is a water taxi service with three launches that bring people to and from their boats. With COVID rules, boats can run at 50% capacity, as long as everyone on board wears masks and keeps six feet apart. (Groups traveling to the same boat can sit closer together.)
 "People are being courteous," Sheehan said. "I'm really happy about that. During a normal time, people are more focused on getting out there. They're in a rush to relax. Now, everybody wants to make sure everybody else is happy and safe."
 At the Pleon Yacht Club, Program Director Kieran O'Connell says it has been an "interesting" summer due to COVID-19 restrictions, but he's glad that Junior Race Week will happen, even if it's only with single-person boats.
 Pleon, Marblehead's yacht club run for and by kids, has seen a drop in attendance from about 200 to 155. It had to cancel programs for beginners because those lessons are too hands-on. Most kids are sailing solo.
 "Sailing is the most socially-distant activity you can do," O'Connell said.
 "Kids are so excited to be out of the house," she continued. "They're doing a great job staying masked and separated."
 The Eastern, Corinthian, and Boston Yacht Clubs did not respond to requests for interviews.
 The waters aren't quite as smooth for local fishermen, says Captain Jay Michaud, who has been working on Marblehead Harbor since 1972. The problem in large part stems from the fact that, due to the pandemic, not as many people are eating out.
 "The biggest impact on fishermen, especially lobstermen, is that the market has collapsed for our product," Michaud said. "People eat lobsters in restaurants. It's a very big problem. What we get paid at the dock has collapsed. In 2020, we're getting paid 1985 prices."
 Michaud says he fishes with family members, so he doesn't need to take any special precautions on his boat, The International Harvester. But once he comes ashore, "We have to take safety measures. If we're at the dock, we're going to wear a mask."
 Still, Michaud says he understands the restrictions set in place in Massachusetts so far.
 "Don't feel bad for me, this is a worldwide thing," he said. "I had three great-grandparents who died in the 1918 flu epidemic. Thank God we live in Massachusetts. We spent the winter in Florida. They're dropping like flies down there and they still don't believe it's real."

“Dining at home is nice, but the food doesn’t arrive as hot, it’s not presented as well and somebody always has to do the dishes when you’re done,” Brown said. “So it’s not a substitute for dining out.”
 Despite short-term difficulties for tenants like fitness centers, which have been forced to shut down in many states, malls are still likely to move in that direction when this is over if only because of the pressure e-commerce continues to place on physical stores, CoStar’s Trantham said.
 “While it may take a while for fitness centers and restaurants to expand at the same rate as they were before, we will still believe that they will recover eventually,” Trantham said.
 In the long run, mall property owners may need to pivot once again, turning toward alternative options for their space, like hotels, apartments, or online product fulfillment centers, analysts say.

Illinois High School Association executive director Craig Anderson said Friday in an interview with WJRM's Jim Taylor that he is concerned but remains optimistic that fall sports will start.
   
 "As of today, as a result of recent decisions we've had to make in just the last couple days, it has me a bit concerned," Anderson said. "I remain hopeful that even with these setbacks that we'll get back to more activity soon assuming that our schools continue to do it safely and we don't have any spikes or spread of the virus."
   
 Anderson's interview followed a decision by the Illinois Department of Public Health to make Phase 4 return-to-play rules more restrictive by requiring masks be worn by all participants in indoor activities, eliminate physical contact in drills and practices and to strictly enforce a 50-person limit on gatherings.
   
 "We've got to get back to having the permission to being able to have some physical contact in order for us to play a number of our fall sports, so many of our sports require that physical contact," he added. "It's something that we've got to progress towards and we'll see what happens with that in the coming weeks."
   
 Anderson didn't rule out the possibility of delayed, canceled or shortened seasons.
   
 "I think depending on how this trends, a delayed start may be letting our students get back to school and get that underway before we resume some activities, will be things we'll have to consider. That's definitely possible -- a couple of weeks working our way back to some of these opportunities," Anderson said. "If we have to shorten a season but can still provide the opportunity, it's something I'm sure our board will consider."
   
 According to the IHSA standard calendar, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls golf, boys soccer, football, girls tennis, volleyball and girls swimming are scheduled to start practices on Aug. 10.
   
 "Our kids, in my opinion, desperately need opportunities," Anderson said. "Activities are a part of school. They really go hand in hand with the development of our young people. We need both.
   
 "We have to work together and work for progress to provide opportunities for these kids."
   
 Flipping the fall and spring sports seasons remains an option.
   
 "That still isn't off the table," Anderson said. "It gets more complicated as we get closer to the start of the fall, but if we can't have physical contact and that's going to be the directive, other sports that we could play with limited to no physical contact, it may still make sense to flip seasons. A lot of those decisions are going to be made soon, I believe."

“We are not Texas,” he said, referring to a state with a high growth rate in COVID-19 cases. “We are on the back end of it. When COVID-19 is a low transmission situation for Connecticut, having students out of school might be more harmful than the probability of getting the virus.”
 Gov. Ned Lamont has expressed confidence in the administration’s school reopening plan in light of the state’s low infection rate of about 1 percent.
 Willett said COVID-19 has had an impact on students’ mental health because of the isolation and stress of the situation.
 He said the school system is putting protocols in place to keep students and staff members safe. It is writing a school-reopening plan that must be submitted to the state by the last week in July.
 “More than anything else, the business of education is literally the welfare and advancement of human beings,” he said. “We have to do everything we can to make sure we are living up to the core mission of our work to do no harm and to provide the best environment for learning.”
 Board of Education Vice Chairwoman Christina Plourd said that, as a working parent, she is a big advocate for giving parents the choice between an online learning model and a safe return to physical classrooms.
 She applauded the teachers returning to the classroom.

BULLOCH COUNTY, Ga. (WTOC) - We hear about companies, even governments, hacked and held hostage online and forced to pay ransom. In Georgia, some schools are teaching students how to help combat this.Instructor Terry Hand says cybercrime hasn't shut down due to the pandemic.“Businesses are experiencing attacks, ransomware attacks, phishing scams, social engineering attacks, it’s at epic proportions,” Hand said.He's been teaching in Ogeechee Technical College's cybercrime analyst program since it started a little over a year ago. The school was among the first wave of a dozen or so in Georgia to add a program to meet the growing demand.“Pull up any job website and you’ll see hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs listed,” Hand said.Hand says companies everywhere are hiring analysts to either find the hackers and undo what they've done or bolster the company's site who people can't hack it in the first place.Hand has added certifications that allow the college to offer more IT and cybercrime courses. The college is in the middle of a lab reboot with 25 new computers to stay up on cybercrime features and adding more space to the lab.While some instructors face a challenge with no students in front of them, Hand hasn't slowed a step.“We have some great companies out there, like Test Out and Mind Tap, that provide us with incredible software that makes you almost feel like you’re in the lab even if you’re at home,” Hand said. “So, I’m still doing lectures like it’s an actual classroom. I can project what’s on my screen to their screen. They have the software to do labs. It’s almost like we’re together, in the room together.”Students can complete the program in 18 to 24 months if they’re in school full-time. But they also offer night and weekend courses as well for those who want to be Skilled to Work for the future.Copyright 2020 WTOC. All rights reserved.

“I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven’t been on television very much lately,” Fauci said.
 Trump's political foes put it more strongly.
 “The president’s disgusting attempt to pass the buck by blaming the top infectious disease expert in the country — whose advice he repeatedly ignored and Joe Biden consistently implored him to take — is yet another horrible and revealing failure of leadership as the tragic death toll continues to needlessly grow,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Democrat Biden’s presidential campaign.
 Fauci's public contradictions of Trump have been viewed by the president as a personal affront and have caused some in the West Wing to sour on the doctor, officials say. Some say that, while he is critical of the president in media interviews, he is largely deferential behind closed doors. And they complain about those outside the administration, including some in the media, who have elevated Fauci at the expense of other officials.
 Fauci did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
 That lionizing of Fauci is anything but welcome as the White House tries to have its medical experts take a step back from the limelight to keep the election-season focus on economic recovery rather than the persistence of the pandemic.
 In the early days of the virus, as Trump bristled at the attention Fauci was receiving, the West Wing took control of the doctor’s media schedule, significantly cutting into his TV appearances though he continued to find alternative outlets — including podcasts and social media.
 The president’s team has made clear they have no intention of trying to oust Fauci, knowing the uproar that would create. Instead, they appear content to diminish his reach while encouraging Republican lawmakers, administration officials and other allies to highlight some of Fauci’s early missteps.
 The effort is part of a White House effort to “counterpunch” on behalf of Trump, who believes all slights must have a forceful response, said one official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal White House thinking.
 At the same time, supporters are flocking to Fauci’s defense. The Association of American Medical Colleges' president and chief scientific officer issued a statement saying the organization was “extremely concerned and alarmed by efforts" to discredit Fauci.
 “We cannot allow Donald Trump to silence Dr. Fauci or any other government scientists,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who introduced legislation in April to protect Fauci and other leaders of the National Institutes of Health from being fired for political reasons. “Dr. Fauci is saving lives every day.”

(WVUE) -There was definitely a bit of confusion when LHSAA executive director Eddie Bonine mentioned a phase four on Monday.“I said phase four yesterday,” Bonine said on Off the Bench on ESPN 104.5 radio in Baton Rouge. “People are losing their minds at the fact that they can’t find a phase four. I get it. At the end of the day, I could’ve said post-phase three.”What you could take from that is a miscommunication. But what St. James head football coach Robert Valdez hopes is that it makes everyone realize what needs to be done if they want high school football in the fall.“Alerting people and letting people know that we’re not going to play until we get to phase four is going to wake some people up a little bit and be like, ‘Whoa. Wait a minute. We’ve got to do our part so that the kids can their part,‘” says Valdez.To be clear, phase four is strictly on the LHSAA timeline. Bonine says that they will follow the state through each phase, and that once Louisiana reaches phase three, then if numbers are still trending in the right direction, the LHSAA can give their own green light on their own phase four, which would allow contact sports like football.“What we need guys is the state needs to go back to doing whatever we were doing that got us out of phase one to get us into phase two that we’re in right now,” says Bonine”. It seems like we’ve been in phase two for a long time with the state. Whatever we were doing back then, we need to continue to get back to that.”And that's the most worrisome part for some coaches.“I’m more concerned nowadays with just controlling the controllables,” says Valdez. “The hardest part is to try to get people to put their individual agendas aside and stop politicizing this thing and to do what’s best. Because our profession and what we do as educators on dealing with students is incumbent upon how we handle this, how people in our community in our country in our state handle this. "And as an educator, Valdez says the importance of extracurricular activities is vital to learning students.“Everybody’s not a 4.0 role model honor student,” says Valdez. “And even an 4.0 role model honor student needs a break from that and uses athletics and extracurricular activities. And knowing our kids, they’re just a little bit dejected because they don’t know. It doesn’t look bright to them.”Hopefully, that can change as we await the next chance to move into phase three.Copyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.

May I offer one more comment on Samuel J. Hofman's letter "Focus for Blacks needs to be on family"?
   
 In this letter, among his other mistakes, Mr. Hofman errs by confusing correlation and causation. Yes, it is true that single-parent households are more common among African Americans than among white families. But, African American families are also, on average, poorer than white families.
   
 In his book "Coming Apart: The State of White America," conservative commentator Charles Murray separates white Americans based on economic status and demonstrates that rates of single-parent households, divorce and out-of- wedlock child birth among poor white Americans (bottom third) is essentially the same as for African Americans -- whose average household incomes are (perhaps not coincidentally) equivalent to the bottom third of white families.

Regardless of how school classrooms will look like this fall, it is now more certain than ever that students will face some days of remote learning.
 On Tuesday, Gov. Roy Cooper announced that public schools will not operate exclusively on campus, if at all.
 But Pitt County Schools officials are working to ensure that no matter where they are learning, students will have the tools they need to be successful.
 In June, the Board of Education passed the 2020-21 budget, with $1.6 million allocated for making the transition from classroom to at-home learning as seamless as possible.
 On Monday, board members voted unanimously at a specially called meeting to use the designated funds to purchase software and technology that will allow students to access the assignments and information they need, regardless their internet access.
 The money will go to purchase new Chromebooks and iPads, installed with updated software that will put all students on an even playing field.
 Superintendent Ethan Lenker said, “Everything we are talking about purchasing is geared toward either Plan A, B or C. Everything we are buying is designed around remote learning.”
 Plans A, B and C were the options being discussed on the state level, ranging from using minimal social distancing (A), to moderate social distancing (B), to only offering online learning (C).
 Gov. Roy Cooper announced on Tuesday that plan A is not being considered at this time, given the rate at which COVID-19 is rising in the state. Normal instruction would have been offered in Plan A, but schools would have been expected to prepare for some use of remote learning if conditions worsen.
 Now, schools must be ready to implement plan B or C, limiting the number of students allowed on campus at any given time — unless the state’s coronavirus health metrics improve.
 The purchases will ensure that with either plan B or C, all children will have what they need.

Dear Dave,   What exactly is the debt snowball, and why is it such an important part of your plan?   Lee
 Dear Lee,   The debt snowball is Baby Step 2 of my plan for getting out of debt and gaining control of your finances. Specifically, it's the part of the plan where you sit down with your budget and look at all the money you owe. Then, list your debts from smallest to largest - except for your home - and pay them off in that order.
 I know, there are all sorts of arguments about paying off the ones with the highest interest rates first. But this is psychology class, not math. Personal finance is 80% behavior and 20% knowledge. Besides, if you were so great at math you wouldn't have debt, would you? Pay off your debts from smallest to largest, unless there's a huge emergency, such as you're facing foreclosure, or the IRS is banging on your door.
 The reason we pay off debts from smallest to largest is to build confidence and enthusiasm by notching quick wins. If you go on a diet and lose weight in the first week, you'll probably stay on that diet. If you go on a diet and gain weight, or go weeks with no visible progress, chances are you'll quit. When you start the debt snowball, and in the first few days pay off a couple of debts, it lights a fire underneath you, and you start to believe you really can do it.
 After you list the debts from smallest to largest, pay the minimum payment to stay current on all the debts except the smallest. Every dollar you can squeeze out of your budget goes toward the smallest debt until it is paid. Once the smallest one is paid, the payment from that debt - plus any extra "found" money - is added to the next smallest debt. Then, when debt number two is paid off, you take the money that you used to pay on number one and number two, and you pay it on number three. When three is paid, you attack number four and so on. A lot of folks get to the bottom of the list and find they can pay well over $1,000 a month on a student loan or a car. At that point, it won't take long to bust out and be debt-free except for your home.
 The main elements that make the debt snowball so powerful are budgeting, getting current before you start the debt snowball, the smallest-to-largest pay-off, sacrifice, discipline and focused intensity. If you think the debt snowball is just another trick, or something you might kind of try, it won't work. You've got to go all-in to win!

RALEIGH — Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced guidelines on Tuesday that will allow North Carolina K-12 schools to reopen at reduced in-classroom capacity, but will give parents and school districts the choice to have classes entirely online.
 The guidelines from Cooper and the Department of Health and Human Services allow in-person instruction if students, teachers and staff members wear face coverings, are screened daily for COVID-19 symptoms and remain 6 feet apart at school. The plan also lets families decide whether to opt-in for remote learning.
 “We know schools will look a lot different this year," Cooper said in an afternoon news conference. "They have to to be safe and effective.”
 Cooper's announcement came the same day that Pitt County recorded its 10th death related to COVID-19 and 986 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of 3:25 p.m. Tuesday.
 School districts previously were directed to draft three plans. Plan A called for entirely in-person classes, Plan B included a hybrid of online and in- person learning and Plan C promoted fully remote instruction. Cooper decided to go with Plan B statewide, though districts could elect to implement Plan C.
 Pitt County Board of Education Chairwoman Betsy Flanagan said in a telephone interview following Tuesday's news conference that the district is not prepared to announce a decision on whether it will reopen schools at reduced capacity (Plan B) or offer online instruction only (Plan C). That decision is expected to be made at the board's next meeting on July 20.
 “I think Plan B probably does offer the most challenges logistically as to how schools are traditionally set up,” Flanagan said. “A lot of these finer details are still being developed.”
 One of the challenges is transportation, she said, adding that a school bus with a capacity of more than 70 students would be permitted to transport no more than two dozen at the time.
 If the board opts for Plan B, students would receive online instruction every other week, attending classes on alternating weeks in order to be able to maintain recommended physical distancing. Flanagan said that regardless of next week's vote, families would retain the option of selecting all online instruction for their children.
 Pitt County Schools Public Information Officer Jennifer Johnson said that of more than 12,000 students whose parents have submitted registration forms for the next school year, 65 percent plan to return to the classroom while 34 percent plan to remain at home for online instruction.
 Cooper also announced on Tuesday that he will extend a current executive in order to keep the state in Phase 2 of its reopening for another three weeks, which will keep businesses including bars, movie theaters and gyms closed through Aug. 7. Bowling alleys will return to being closed under a temporary order the state Supreme Court issued Tuesday.
 State law appears to prevent remote learning during the first week of school, though Cooper said his plan is legal because of the broad emergency authority he has during the pandemic. Republicans worry Cooper's directive further harms businesses and will hurt students' ability to receive the in-person instruction they need.
 “Today’s announcement that classrooms will remain closed to students either periodically or completely exacerbates the administration’s economic and public health failures while adding even more uncertainty for struggling families in North Carolina,” Republican House Speaker Tim Moore said.
 School districts that decide to reopen will need to conduct temperature checks, clean and disinfect common surfaces and provide hand sanitizer for every classroom. Schools also will be prohibited from offering self-service food options and hosting activities, such as assemblies, that bring large groups together.

“There’s a lack of limit-setting, and she may interpret it as a lack of caring,” Greenberg says. “She has too much control and kids don’t want that much control … they’re not comfortable with it.”
 Will she be angry when you respond to her behaviour by setting additional limits? Yes. Yes, she will. But again, the anger is already there, it’s just simmering beneath the surface. You see it every time she looks at you. And it’s ok for her to be angry and to voice that anger.
 You write in your letter that you’d like “a path for improving her demeanour and our relationship.” That implies that she is the problem that needs fixing. That if we can fix her demeanour, the relationship will be better. But the inverse is true — if you want to fix her demeanour, you have to fix the relationship. And not just her relationship with _you_ but the relationships among the entire family. You should all, Greenberg suggests, go to family therapy together.
 If you also want to pursue finding her own therapist, that’s fine, too. But try getting her more involved in the selection-process this time. Research potential options online together. Let her pick a few people to interview and then let her choose the person she best connects with. That can certainly be beneficial; but for now, Greenberg says, the need for family therapy is more pressing.
 And finally, you mention smaller things like her lack of interest in working on her soccer skills, her crankiness over chores or her reluctance to do schoolwork. Put those things on the back burner for now. Even the — much more important — fact that she has come out as gay to your wife (but not you) and hasn’t told you about her girlfriend.
 “Resolving the family issues should come first,” Greenberg says, “and then everything else will follow.”

"Playing in the Champions League has helped us and made us grow," added Gasperini, whose side will play Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight next month.
 "We are preparing for Paris Saint-Germain, but also want to fight to the end in Serie A.
 "I think the best way to be ready for August 12 will be to play these last five league games to the maximum."
 The game between high-scoring Atalanta and 19th-placed Brescia was one between two neighbouring teams from cities ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
 A minute's silence took place before kick-off with players forming a circle with the backdrop of the music "Rinascero, Rinascerai" (I will be reborn, you will be reborn), by Bergamo musician Roby Facchinetti.
 Atalanta's top scorer Luis Muriel, with 17 league goals this season, watched from the stands hours after the Colombian left hospital after suffering a head injury in a fall at his home.
 But his absence was not felt with Croatian Pasalic opening the scoring within two minutes at the Gewiss Stadium connecting with a Ruslan Malinovskyi cross.
 Brescia hit back minutes later with Ernesto Torregrossa pouncing on Atalanta defender Mattia Caldara's poor clearance.
 But the hosts got back into their stride and were four-goals up after half an hour with Marten De Roon, Malinovskyi and a Duvan Zapata header within a five- minute spell.
 The punishment continued in the second half with Malinovskyi again setting up Pasalic to beat Lorenzo Andrenacci in the Brescia goal after 55 minutes.
 The Croatian added a third three minutes later sending in Ebrima Colley's cross for his ninth goal this season, five of them against Brescia, having scored a brace in the away leg last November.
 "It's the best moment of my career," said Pasalic after his maiden hat-trick.
 "There are still five games left and we can do even better.
 "We have scored more than 90 goals in Serie A, we have shown against Juventus (2-2 draw) that we can match even the strongest teams."
 Nikolas Spalek pulled a goal back for Brescia who move closer to Serie B next season.
 Atalanta however are having one of the best seasons in the club's 112-year history with a berth in the Champions League quarter-finals in their debut season.

 But since the coronavirus pandemic has forced nearly all of MediCopy's 200 employees to work from home, Holt has had an abrupt change of heart. He says he’ll let staffers continue to telecommute for the long term, prompting him to relinquish both of the additional offices, convert his headquarters into a training center, and save $350,000 a year in leasing costs.

The Federal Reserve moved rapidly and aggressively to restore the normal functioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses. The forceful response was appropriate in light of the extraordinary nature of the crisis and the importance of minimizing harm to the livelihoods of so many Americans. With the restoration of smooth market functioning and credit flows, our emergency facilities are appropriately moving into the background, providing confidence that they remain available as an insurance policy if storm clouds again move in.

But there’s a second Senate race in Georgia that is quite likely to go to a runoff: the special election to choose someone to finish the term Isakson gave up at the end of last year due to poor health. Under Georgia’s rules, a nonpartisan “jungle primary” will be held the same day as the general election (November 3), and if no one wins a majority, the top two finishers will go to a January 5 runoff. There are 20 candidates who will appear on the ballot, including the interim appointed senator, Republican Kelly Loeffler. She faces fierce competition for Republican voters from congressman Doug Collins. Democratic leaders are mostly backing Ebenezer Baptist Church pastor Raphael Warnock, but early polls have shown Matt Lieberman (son of Joe) with significant support, probably because of name ID. The odds of anyone winning a majority in November are low.

Companies look up to skilled web developers when they wish to execute their idea of building a website from scratch. Web developers assist brands in finalising the website design as per the trends, user requirements, and relevance to the competitors and the market. They build and test the website, add content management systems and complicated e-commerce tools in it, and they use programming languages like HTML & CSS to code the website. Web developers collectively work with different teams to finalise the content that would go on the website, decide the website’s layout, graphics, audio, and video with the help of other designers, and continuously monitor the website to manage its functionality, add new features, and keep the site secure.

I’m not gonna lie—I thought this would be easy peasy because I’m in generally good shape. However, once I spent some time ensuring that my form was correct, all it took was a five-minute warmup to feel _everything_ and then some. Lining my heels with the back of the foot pedals is what bruised my ego and caused every muscle in my backside and thighs to activate so quickly. Keeping your back straight and lightly gripping the handles matter, too. Please don’t sleep on the time it takes to get yourself acclimated, especially as you begin to play with different levels of squats. (You really feel the burn when doing the mid or lower-range ones.)

ALICEVILLE, Ala. (WBRC) - Belinda Craig felt happy seeing so many folks come to the drive-thru COVID-19 testing site hosted by New Wright Baptist Church in Aliceville Tuesday.The Church needs to be a beacon in the community to provide positive things to people and let people know that God is real. He’s a healer and there’s nothing wrong with getting tested,” Craig told WBRC.People with the University of Alabama College of Community Health Sciences tested people for COVID-19 free of charge.“The COVID is getting a little bit too high, the numbers. Instead of going down, they’re going up. So I worry. I need to be going back to work soon. So I make sure I don’t get it,” Dagmar Ball explained.“We just want to sort through this out and keep everybody safe,” Eddie James Tweedie added.The coronavirus testing helps health officials track the amount of spread happening in communities. And if necessary, they can begin tracing who people testing positive for coronavirus have been around.“They know people that were affected. Not only affected, but have died, and so it’s really scaring people,” according to Professor Pamela Foster, with the UA College of Community Health Sciences.The rapid testing happening at the drive-thru allows people to get their test results back in 10 to 15 minutes.The University of Alabama works with Alabama Power to conduct the screenings at no cost to the people getting tested. These COVID-19 screenings have been in at least five West Alabama counties so far.Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

BRAINTREE -- Mayor Charles Kokoros said he will meet later this week with the leader of the Massachusetts Native Americans to discuss the high school's Wamp mascot.
 During Monday night's remote meeting of the school committee, the mayor said he has already learned a lot during a phone conversation with Faries Gray, the sagamore or chief of the Massachusett tribe. Kokoros said he is looking forward to the meeting.
 "I am going to do whatever I can to be educated on this issue," Kokoros said.
 Gray is a descendant of Josiah Wampatuck, the Massachusett tribal leader who inspired the Wamp. In 1615, Wampatuck signed the "Braintree Indian Deed" which gave the colonists the land that is now Braintree, Quincy, Randolph and Holbrook.
 The mascot is being reviewed by the school committee, and the meeting between Gray and Kokoros is to be the first step in the process. Gray does not support the use of the mascot, feeling that it does not honor Native Americans but treats them like a "trophy."
 The mascot is also the subject of opposing petition drives on change.org. The one to drop the mascot had 7,000 signatures as of late Monday and the one to retain it had 2,800 signatures.
 Kokoros said he has received many e-mails from high school students and graduates on the issue.
 In other business, the committee received a report on the East Middle School project.
 Michael Carroll of Hill International, the town's project manager, said the renovation work on the original portions of the building are being completed.
 "We still have some odds and ends to finish up," Carroll said.
 He said the work should be completed by mid-August.
 School committee Chairman Thomas Devin, who also chairs the school building committee, said the $83 million East Middle School expansion and renovation project remains "on time and on budget."
 East is slated to house Grade 5 classes this fall in addition to Grades 6-8.

Another reason I’m obsessed with this machine is that you don’t have to spend all day on it to see and feel a difference. It’s recommended that you spend just 10 minutes per day putting your legs to work. With about one month of consistent, almost daily use, my thighs are noticeably firmer, my arms are leaner and though a before-and-after picture wouldn’t be _that_ impressive right now, my butt has lifted just a little. (I may or may not spend more time than usual checking myself out in the mirror.) Every once in a while, I stop and ask myself if I’m clenching my butt on purpose. Nope, the glutes are just fully activated all the time now. TBH, I’m still getting used to it.

Our organization went through a merger in 2005 that was both interesting and difficult, as mergers can be. Once merged, the combined organizations had even more power and influence than either one by itself. I was profoundly struck by how the new association could shine a light on collective good of assocoations in the US and around the world. Just recently, I had the opportunity to help recognize a few associations for their work to make a stronger society. For example, the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores was recognized for its program to stop human trafficking by training their workers to recognize and report suspicious behavior. The American Society of Hematology improves outcomes for Sickle Cell Disease patients. The National Auto Body Council donates electric vehicles to first responders to give them hands-on training in the case of a crash. The Water Environment Federation certifies workers to construct, maintain, and inspect green infrastructure projects. And, these examples just scratch the surface of what associations do to make life better for people everywhere every day.
