But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with BILI trading so far above that average target price of $59.00/share, the -30.33% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good "signal" to investors in BILI to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Bilibili Inc.

Leroy Murrell squeezes a pump Monday morning that helped him reach a total of 100 gallons of his blood donated to the Northern California Community Blood Bank. Murrell completed around 800 trips to the blood bank, where, according to Laura Smither-Rice, a registered nurse, Murrell has "been stuck with a needle approximately 1800 times." Donating 100 gallons of blood requires 1600 hours in the blood donation chair, according to Smither-Rice "which equals 40 work weeks total." In 1994, Murrell helped cut the ribbon for the opening of the new blood bank donated the first pint of blood in the new building. (Jose Quezada, HUMEDIA -- For the Times-Standard)
