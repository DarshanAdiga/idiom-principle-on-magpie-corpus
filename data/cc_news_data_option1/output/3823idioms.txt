Catholics are hardly the only politically marginalized group that has strongly supported a “breakthrough” presidential candidate and then soon felt less need to do so. Southern Baptist Jimmy Carter put together a mind-bending coalition of Black and white southern Evangelicals in 1976 — civil-rights veterans check-by-jowl with crypto-segregationists, as well as Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr. Four years later, he lost every southern state other than his native Georgia. It’s unlikely that any presidential candidate will ever get the kind of Black support (and turnout) Barack Obama achieved in 2008. This sort of dynamic is evident even in regional subgroups. In 1990, Appalachian pol Zell Miller swept his native North Georgia Mountain region on his way to becoming the first hillbilly governor in living memory. Four years later he lost the region and narrowly survived thanks to a surge in the Atlanta suburbs, and now north Georgia is one of the most profoundly Republicans areas in the country.

A Massachusetts construction worker's love of black licorice wound up costing him his life. Eating a bag and a half every day for a few weeks threw his nutrients out of whack and caused the 54-year-old man's heart to stop, doctors reported Wednesday.
 "Even a small amount of licorice you eat can increase your blood pressure a little bit," said Dr. Neel Butala, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who described the case in the New England Journal of Medicine.
 The problem is glycyrrhizic acid, found in black licorice and in many other foods and dietary supplements containing licorice root extract. It can cause dangerously low potassium and imbalances in other minerals called electrolytes.
 Eating as little as 2 ounces of black licorice a day for two weeks could cause a heart rhythm problem, especially for folks over 40, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns.
 "It's more than licorice sticks. It could be jelly beans, licorice teas, a lot of things over the counter. Even some beers, like Belgian beers, have this compound in it," as do some chewing tobaccos, said Dr. Robert Eckel, a University of Colorado cardiologist and former American Heart Association president. He had no role in the Massachusetts man's care.
 The death was clearly an extreme case. The man had switched from red, fruit- flavored twists to the black licorice version of the candy a few weeks before his death last year. He collapsed while having lunch at a fast-food restaurant. Doctors found he had dangerously low potassium, which led to heart rhythm and other problems. Emergency responders did CPR and he revived but died the next day.
 The FDA permits up to 3.1% of a food's content to have glycyrrhizic acid, but many candies and other licorice products don't reveal how much of it is contained per ounce, Butala said. Doctors have reported the case to the FDA in hope of raising attention to the risk.
 Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for the Hershey Company, which makes the popular Twizzlers licorice twists, said in an email that "all of our products are safe to eat and formulated in full compliance with FDA regulations," and that all foods, including candy, "should be enjoyed in moderation."

Beta will continue to move east taking the rain with it! That means dry skies for us today, although we still could see a good bit of cloud cover. Highs will top out in the low 80s. Coastal flooding will finally ease today as westerly winds develop.With the drier air behind Beta, we’ll stay dry through the rest of the work week and the weekend. This will allow temperatures to climb into the mid to upper 80s. Early next week may be a tad toasty ahead of our first strong cold front of the season. Forecast guidance still isn’t crystal clear on whether the front will arrive Tuesday or Wednesday, but it is looking very likely that we’ll see highs in the 70s and lows in the 50s and 60s by the middle of next week.There is NO development expected in the tropics in the next 5 days!Copyright 2020 WVUE.

Feli a spus recent „da” când tatăl fetiței ei a cerut-o în căsătorie. În revista de octombrie, cei trei apar pentru prima dată într-un pictorial inedit de familie.Feli și viitorul ei soț, Cătălin, au fost mereu foarte discreți cu relația lor, preferând să o păstreze departe ochii lumii. Rareori cei doi au fost văzuți împreună în ochiul public. Au făcut însă o excepție pentru ediția de octombrie a revistei Unica, în care s-au lăsat fotografiați împreună, alături de Nora Luna.Cu această ocazie, Feli ne-a vorbit despre viața lor în trei, despre cererea în căsătorie și multe alte povești à la #FeliDinPoveste, pe care le vei regăsi în numărul de octombrie al revistei Unica.Feli, acum că aproape se împlinesc doi ani din momentul în care a apărut Nora Luna în viața ta și a lui Cătălin, ce lecție importantă simți că ai învățat?Lecția răbdării și a iubirii. E o altfel de iubire cea pe care o primesc de la Nora Luna. Viața e o continuă lecție, dar rolul de mamă mă învață atâtea. Mi-am dat seama că uneori am fost egoistă când îi spuneam Norei să nu mai tipe, spre exemplu. Că eu nu voiam să țipe că mă “deranja” pe mine, adultul. Am învățat să am răbdare și să dau pași înapoi când mă aștept că ea să înțeleagă ca un om mare. Învăț să iubesc altfel lucrurile mici, care sunt de fapt atât de mari.

Este cel mai bun învățător al meu.Cum s-a schimbat dinamica de cuplu odată cu apariția micuței?A fost o provocare a vieții pentru amândoi, pentru că Nora Luna a venit supriză încă de la începutul relației. În prima săptămână după ce Cătălin s-a mutat în țară, am rămas însărcinată. Nu am avut un șoc atunci când am aflat. Ne-am bucurat amândoi ca doi copii! Am plâns și ne-am făcut promisiunea că vom lucra la relația noastră și împreună, și separat, că să creștem un om și o femeie plină de încredere și bunătate. Desigur, am avut și perioade grele, pentru că ne-am trezit într-un necunoscut care ne-a adus o groază de stări și semne de întrebare. “Oare pot să fiu un părinte bun? Oare sunt pregătit/ă?”, întrebări pe care aproape toți părinții cred că le au când sunt pe cale să devină pentru prima data părinți. Eu nu am fost neapărat cea mai liniștită. Am trecut printr-o depresie destul de urâtă, dar Cătălin, mama și prietenii-familie, terapia (care este foarte importantă în viața tuturor), m-au ajutat enorm.Care a fost până acum cea mai mare provocare întâlnită în cadrul vieții de familie?În perioada de izolare și după ea s-au rupt familii despre care puteam să spun că sunt perfect sudate. Mi-a fost teamă pentru relația mea, sincer. Am luat izolarea ca pe un test. Am stat luni de zile 24/24 cu omul meu. Știam că o să văd părți din el și el din mine pe care în viața de dinainte nu apucam să le vedem, pentru că eu plecam des de acasă în concerte prin țară, el era cu job-ul. Am luat în calcul faptul că noi am devenit părinți înainte să fim o relație și mă întrebam “Dacă de fapt totul e o proiecție de-a ta și realitatea e totuși alta și deloc plăcută?”. Dar uite că pe noi ne-a sudat și mai tare tot ce s-a întâmplat anul ăsta. Ne-am spus adevăruri frumoase, adevăruri mai puțin frumoase, toate spuse cu maturitate și iubire și asta ne-a ajutat enorm. Așa mi-am dat seama că trăim o iubire matură și că ne dorim familia asta din iubire pură față de noi ca și cuplu, nu doar din iubire față de fetița noastră.Întregul interviu poate fi citit în ediția de octombrie a revistei Unica, care se găsește la punctele de difuzare a presei începând cu 24 septembrie.

Rather, our Founding Fathers created a republic or what might be termed a representative democracy. We get to vote on who gets to vote on issues. Back in the day when Congress was only in session part-time, as is still the case with Indiana’s General Assembly and all our city councils, this worked well enough as representatives spent most of the year living among and conversing with their constituents. This seems to me so much better a system than one inhabited by full-time professional politicians who spend most of their time cocooned in the Beltway with well-expensed lobbyists and elitist media types.
 This system, no matter how imperfect and dysfunctional it can be at times, will only work if we the voters act as democrats (small “d”). That means understanding the rules of the game and playing by them once the whistle blows. Here is where our democracy may be going off the rails.
 Voting in a democratic society means that someone wins and someone loses. Nearly all losers graciously concede and most go into loyal opposition, no doubt plotting revenge at future elections while parlaying their minority status into legislative bargaining power in the present. Even Richard Nixon, considered by many to be the most amoral of our presidents, conceded to John Kennedy in 1960 in spite of substantial evidence of voter fraud in Mayor Daily’s Chicago and the state of Texas, perhaps enough to swing the election. This compares Nixon favorably to Al Gore, but there may be something much worse in the offing.
 Hilary Clinton (remember her?) has publicly counseled Joe Biden not to concede the election “under any circumstances.” Presumably “any circumstance” includes a resounding loss by Biden on Nov. 3. It certainly includes the scenario in which armies of lawyers challenge ballot counting in key districts that Mrs. Clinton assumes by divine right should report more Biden votes than local election officials see fit to certify. Does it also include sending mobs back into the streets for “mostly peaceful” protests that involve looting, burning and killing? As much as I dislike Mrs. Clinton’s character and ideology, I can’t bring myself to believe she really wants that to happen.So why heat up the rhetoric?
 Democracy won’t, can’t, work unless both winners and losers accept the will of the voters as determined by a simple, first past the post count. Losers denouncing the results and declaring the winner illegitimate aren’t simply acting as spoiled two-year olds throwing temper tantrums. They are subverting the democratic process and to what end? Short term power at whatever cost? Would they sacrifice our democracy on the altar of power? When they refuse to accept the will of the voters, their insincere commitment to democracy and our Constitution is exposed for what it is. Too many nations over the course of human history have suffered the death of their democratic institutions at the hands of mobocracy, starting with classical Athens where democratic government was incubated.
 My nightmare is that we haven’t learned from history and therefore will repeat it to our hurt as the philosopher Santayana warned. My hope is that this, like all nightmares, is only a bad dream which disappears at break of day. I can’t wake up soon enough.

In a county traditionally dominated by Republicans, voters in Walworth County have a choice this November in a race to fill a countywide office.
 The office of county register of deeds is up for grabs in a race that pits Democratic incumbent Cairie Virrueta against Republican challenger Michele Jacobs.
 The winner of the election will serve four years at a salary of $74,000 a year as the county’s chief keeper of records such as real estate sales, birth certificates and marriage licenses.
 Donna Pruess held the office for seven years, but she stepped down in March after deciding to retire from a career in county government that had continued for 40 years in various capacities.

Luis Suarez cried as he bid farewell to Barcelona on Thursday but said he wants to prove he can still deliver at the highest level after joining La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.
 With Lionel Messi at Camp Nou for his best friend's final press conference, Suarez said an emotional goodbye after scoring 198 goals for Barca, becoming the third highest goalscorer in the history of the club.
 "This is improvised because I have nothing prepared," Suarez said wiping his eyes, having been introduced by the club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu.
 The 33-year-old's move to Atletico on a two-year contract had been confirmed late on Wednesday night. Atletico have signed Suarez for free but could pay Barcelona 6 million euros ($6.9 million) in variables.
 "I feel I'm capable of continuing to compete in this league," Suarez said. "I feel very eager and even more after the last year we had, when I had my injury, which also leaves you with a bittersweet feeling.
 "I am going the way I'm going to keep playing, with fresh motivation, with the objective to show I can continue competing."
 Suarez follows Arturo Vidal, Nelson Semedo and Ivan Rakitic through the exit door at Barcelona, where new coach Ronald Koeman has been tasked with renovating the squad.
 Koeman told Suarez in August he was not part of the club's plans.
 "I expected it because it had been said already before the coach told me but I can accept it," he said.
 "When Barca told me they weren't counting on me, there were many calls, many offers, but I was able to go to a team that can compete as equals with two great teams like Barcelona and Real Madrid. I had no doubts."
 Suarez will go down as one of Barcelona's greatest ever players after helping them win four La Liga titles and a Champions League.
 But his departure has not been smooth, with the club keen to push the Uruguayan out but reluctant to let him join Atletico.
 "Players sometimes need a change, the club needed a change and this case the coach didn't want me," Suarez said. "I leave with the feeling that I have fulfilled expectations. To be the third highest scorer is not easy at all, it's something I could never have imagined."
 Suarez's departure could affect Messi's future given the pair are neighbours and best friends. There have been reports in Spain suggesting Messi and Suarez's friendship was no longer considered beneficial to the team.
 "It's been a crazy month," said Suarez. "Things have been invented, things that are not true that have been leaked and that annoy you but we have to try to stay away from all that.
 "Everyone knows the relationship I have with Leo. When you arrive at Barcelona they say to be careful with Leo and now after many years, Leo and I get along spectacularly and they say you are bad for him.
 "We know the time we had in the team and that we tried to perform at our best and live up to what Barcelona is and in my case, I can leave feeling proud."

Each month the Art Museum of South Texas (AMST) highlights a facet of the art world and introduces (or re-introduce) us to local artists with works of art in the same medium, style, or theme.
   
 This month the AMST is focusing on Raul Colon and Alexandria Canchola .
   
 One of AMST's new traveling exhibitions this fall is: Tall Tales and Huge Hearts, an exhibition of original artwork from artist Raul Colon, which opened at the National Center for Children's Illustrated Literature (NCCIL) in the fall of 2012. This exhibition features illustrations from eighteen different books, with subjects ranging from baseball to fantasy. Each colorful and layered illustration communicates moments of action in their respective story, showing the ability of art alone to tell an engaging story.
   
 "I begin with textured watercolor paper, adding a watercolor wash of golden undertone. On top of that, I sketch the image and then add the middle tones. There are about 5 to 8 washes on top of each other. I then use color pencils to make the texture of the paper come out. I also use a scratchboard instrument appropriately called a "scratcher" to draw down through the layers."
   
 Raul Colon, Discussing his illustration process
   
 Alexandria Canchola is second artist being featured this month at the AMST.
   
 Canchola, is an illustrator, designer, and Assistant Professor for the Graphic Design program at Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi.
   
 Her illustrations capture humorous observed moments, autobiographical stories, and reimagine art history. In addition to her works on paper, Canchola transforms the world into illustrations through room sized installations. The rooms are filled with cardboard replicas of every day items, which Canchola paints in the same style as her illustrations.
   
 In these rooms and in Canchola's candy colored work, specific and familiar stories take shape. For those visitors that enjoy the immediacy of Raul Colon's work, we encourage you to let Canchola lead you through the world from another unique perspective.

PORTLAND (AP) — Protesters in Portland hurled Molotov cocktails at officers in Oregon’s largest city during a demonstration over a Kentucky grand jury’s decision to not indict officers in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor, police said Friday. Police and the protesters clashed as demonstrators in cities around the U.S. raged against a criminal justice system they say is stacked against Black people. In Taylor's hometown of Louisville, gunfire rang out and wounded two police officers. The protesters in Portland Thursday night also threw rocks that shattered windows at a law enforcement precinct station, targeted the station with projectiles fired from slingshots, police said in a statement. The Oregonian/Oregonian Live said they set an awning at the station on fire. One officer was hit on the foot with a Molotov cocktail but a fire department medic managed to extinguish the flames, police said. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries. Federal agents assigned to protect a U.S. courthouse fired projectiles at the protesters, the Oregonian/Oregonian Live reported. Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers who entered her home during a narcotics investigation in March. The Kentucky grand jury returned three charges of wanton endangerment Wednesday against fired Louisville Officer Brett Hankison over shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside. Portland has been gripped by protests for four months since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The demonstrations in the city, often violent, have targeted police buildings and federal buildings. Some protesters have called for reductions in police budgets while the city’s mayor and some in the Black community have decried the violence, saying it is counterproductive.

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India on Wednesday said that 40% of the toilets in government schools across the country were found to be non- existent, partially constructed or unused, _The Hindu_ reported. The auditor provided the information in a report presented in Parliament.
 The audit report surveyed 2,695 toilets built by 53 central public sector enterprises in 2,048 schools across 15 states. The enterprises had claimed to have built 1.4 lakh toilets as part of the Right to Education project.
 The CAG’s report found that out of the sample size, the enterprises identified but did not build 83 toilets. Two hundred toilets were said to be constructed but were found to be non-existent. The report also found that 691 toilets were not in use due to lack of water and sanitation facilities while 86 were only built partially.
 The survey also found that at least 75% of the toilets were not being cleaned properly. The report also said that 72% of the constructed toilets had no running water, while 55% had no facilities for washing hands, which is especially concerning amid the coronavirus crisis.
 “During the survey, audit noticed that proper maintenance or sanitation was not available in 1,812 out of 2,326 toilets,” the CAG said in its report, according to PTI. “715 out of 1,812 toilets were not being cleaned. 1,097 toilets were being cleaned twice in a week to once in a month, whereas the norm was for daily cleaning at least once.”
 The report added: “Thus, 75 percent of selected toilets were not maintained hygienically. Cases of non-provision of soap, bucket, cleaning agents and disinfectants in toilets and inadequate cleanliness of pathways were also noticed.”
 The CAG also flagged the lack of separate toilets for girls and boys in co- educational schools. “Out of 1,967 coeducational schools surveyed by Audit, 99 schools had no functional toilets while 436 schools had only one functional toilet,” it said. “The objective of providing separate toilets for boys and girls was not fulfilled in these 535 schools [27 percent of 1,967 schools].”
 In 2014, the Ministry of Human Resource Development had launched the Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan to build separate toilets for boys and girls in schools, as mandated by the Right to Education Act. The government brought 53 enterprises on board to complete the exercise, including the National Thermal Power Corporation, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Coal India Limited.

Barrett had long been rumored as Trump’s choice for replacing Ginsburg when the time came. The White House has been _very_ focused on judicial appointments at all levels, but especially for the Supreme Court because of its import with conservatives. Trump and his team see that as one of the keys to his win in 2016, and a potential key to unlock a second term. It’s not exactly a huge surprise that this decision was made months ago, if not years ago. Since everyone more or less knew that was the likely choice, it also makes it easier to unite the Senate GOP caucus around Barrett too, as opposed to a wild-card choice where support would have to build from scratch.

n perioada de izolare și după ea s-au rupt familii despre care puteam să spun că sunt perfect sudate. Mi-a fost teamă pentru relația mea, sincer. Am luat izolarea ca pe un test. Am stat luni de zile 24/24 cu omul meu. Știam că o să văd părți din el și el din mine pe care în viața de dinainte nu apucam să le vedem, pentru că eu plecam des de acasă în concerte prin țară, el era cu job- ul. Am luat în calcul faptul că noi am devenit părinți înainte să fim o relație și mă întrebam “Dacă de fapt totul e o proiecție de-a ta și realitatea e totuși alta și deloc plăcută?”. Dar uite că pe noi ne-a sudat și mai tare tot ce s-a întâmplat anul ăsta. Ne-am spus adevăruri frumoase, adevăruri mai puțin frumoase, toate spuse cu maturitate și iubire și asta ne-a ajutat enorm. Așa mi-am dat seama că trăim o iubire matură și că ne dorim familia asta din iubire pură față de noi ca și cuplu, nu doar din iubire față de fetița noastră.

One's likelihood of microaggressing also predicts how racist one is judged to be by lab observers, as they watch real interactions unfold. We're currently analyzing the same kind of data from a national sample of adults, and the results look similar.

 "It was a perfect 60 minutes for him," he said. "He will show the qualities he has. Of course, he will get fitter and better.
 "He also gave us something -- for me on the night, in the dressing room and on the pitch -- of a leader with authority of his demands on others."
 Kai Havertz scored a hat-trick to get off the mark for his new club as Chelsea swept past their outclassed Championship opponents, with Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud also finding the net.
 Callum Hudson-Odoi, who continues to receive interest from long-term suitors Bayern Munich, was given a rare start and impressed his boss.
 "Callum did well," said Lampard. "It's not easy when you're coming in and haven't had so many minutes.
 "But I thought in parts he looked fresh and sharp and he was pressing hard and he showed a really good work ethic."

_Writer’s note: Starting this week, the column is back to On Demand releases for the foreseeable future._
 I watched the first two “Bill & Ted” movies to prepare for new installment “Face the Music,” and I have to say, they didn’t do much for me. I didn’t think they were painful or anything, but having grown up with similar dimwitted duos (Wayne and Garth, Beavis and Butthead, etc.), I didn’t think the title pair brought much to the table. Their manner of speaking, which is basically slacker talk with one out of every 10 words inexplicably higher than their apparent vocabulary level, gets old fast and the time travel jokes never rise above “lazy.” I liked that George Carlin was in the movies, but that’s mostly because his appearances triggered happy memories of his standup. The point is that I’m maybe not the target audience for “Face the Music,” since I wasn’t coming in as a fan.
 Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are back as Bill S. Preston, Esq. and “Ted” Theodore Logan, respectively. Although we’ve known since “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” back in 1989 that the duo’s music and philosophy (“Be excellent to each other”) will one day unite the world and usher in centuries of greatness, things aren’t going so excellently lately. Their band, Wyld Stallyns, is on the rocks following the tumultuous departure of Death (William Sadler) and they can’t seem to get the sound or song that will take them back to their previous height. Their marriages to princesses Joanna (Jayma Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) are souring, though they have the love and admiration of their daughters Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine). Also, there’s the small matter of the universe collapsing on itself because they can’t get their act together.
 Fortunately, they have help from a time traveler from the future, Kelly (Kristen Schaal), the daughter of Carlin’s character from the original. She says that they have 47 minutes (in real time) to write the song that will unite the world or the whole universe dies. They can use a time machine however they see fit to accomplish this goal. They decide to go to various intervals in the future to get the song from their future selves, who have already written it. But taking this shortcut just makes their lives in the future miserable. Though have to I wonder how there’s a future at all unless they succeed. Ugh, I saw this movie only a few days after “Tenet,” and I was in no mood to sort out another complex system of time travel.
