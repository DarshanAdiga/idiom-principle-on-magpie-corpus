Absentee ballot applications for the upcoming primary election will continue to be accepted and processed by counties. Once county election officials properly verify the signature on the application, the voter will be sent an absentee ballot for the primary election now to be held on June 9.
 Throughout this crisis, the Secretary of State’s office has been in close contact with county election officials across the state. Over the past week, the reports of mounting difficulties from county election officials, particularly in Southwest Georgia, grew to a point where county election officials could not overcome the challenges brought on by COVID-19 in time for in-person voting to begin on April 27. Additionally, current modeling by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia will peak around April 24, only days before in-person voting was scheduled to begin. While challenges will certainly remain on June 9, these additional three weeks will give the Secretary of State’s office and counties time to shore up contingency plans, find and train additional poll workers, and procure supplies and equipment necessary to clean equipment and protect poll workers.
 Emergency authority is something that should be exercised carefully, and moving an election should only take place in the rarest of circumstances. While Secretary Raffensperger previously expressed concern that he did not have the authority to move the primary election again, the Governor’s extension of the state of emergency to a time that includes almost every day of in-person voting for a May 19 election is sufficient to allow the Secretary to exercise the emergency authority given to him by O.C.G.A. § 21-2-50.1 and move the primary election to June 9.
 “I certainly realize that every difficulty will not be completely solved by the time in-person voting begins for the June 9 election, but elections must happen even in less than ideal circumstances,” said Raffensperger. “Just like our brave healthcare workers and first responders, our county election officials and poll workers are undertaking work critical to our democracy, and they will continue to do this critical work with all the challenges that the current crisis has brought forth. This postponement allows us to provide additional protection and safety resources to county election officials, poll workers, and voters without affecting the November election.”

Companies are placing staff on furlough leave in far greater numbers than the government first predicted, and yet these results suggest that the public is on board with an approach that focuses on keeping people alive rather than keeping businesses running.

One couple, Emma and Lucas McLean, turned their front porch session into something a little extra personal. The couple got married on March 14, the weekend before schools closed and restaurants and churches were shuttered.
 Tn expectant Emma – who is 23 weeks pregnant – was hoping to lear the six of their baby on the couple's wedding day. But the ended up having to wait a couple of weeks. The couple still wanted to announce the news to the people they love, but couldn't ask anyone to visit their house. When they saw Nelson’s plan for the Front Porch Project they realized it would be the perfect gender reveal.
 The photos were taken in their side yard with pasture in the back and blue balloons tied to a tree with a baby onesie.
 “It’s kind of cool that the pictures are kind of shot from a distance because a lot of times you get close up or portrait pictures. It’s kind of focused on everything around you,” said Emma. “Obviously, if you think about coronavirus in general right now, it’s everything going on in the world around us and when she is taking pictures of everything around you it kind of fits the part. I don’t think it’s any less personable.”
 These days are exciting for the McLeans, but they're also nerve wracking with a lot of unknowns. It’s something they'll be able to tell their son some day.
 The Front Porch Project is also a way for Nelson and the rest of her clients to look back on 2020 through the lens of a camera.
 “It will be a part of history,” Nelson said. “I think it will be nice to have something good come out of it.”

"Our study provides the first evidence of how dopamine can directly impact drug-induced gene expression abnormalities and subsequent relapse behavior," says Ian Maze, PhD, Associate Professor of Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and lead author of the study. "Beyond transmission of signals between neurons in the brain, we have found that dopamine can be chemically attached to histone proteins, which causes cells to switch different genes on and off, affecting regions of the brain that are involved in motivation and reward behavior. This biochemical process significantly affects cocaine vulnerability and relapse when perturbed by drugs of abuse."

The Firestein and Hillman labs customized SCAPE to illuminate and view tissues in the noses of mice. The researchers examined neuronal cells within the animals' noses that were labeled with fluorescence that flashed under the microscope when these cells were activated. They then exposed the animals' nasal tissues to a range of different scent combinations: one with a woody bouquet, and the other a mix of almond, floral and citrus scents.

It will be the first orbital launch of astronauts from the U.S. since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011.

Those with cars have a few more choices. Sniffspot, an app that describes itself as Airbnb for dogs, has dozens of small-fee listings by local homeowners who offer yards or properties for free-run use. And while, like Denver, most municipalities have closed their dog parks, Westminster's remain open. That city boasts three of the best dog parks in this part of the state, including Westminster Hills, a massive site that stretches over 420 acres.
 Still, Westminster spokesperson Lauren Gladu reveals that it's not business as usual at the parks. "Staff is monitoring the situation on a regular basis to ensure proper social distancing guidelines are followed," she reports in an email. "We created and placed 'safety tips' signage at each dog park, as well as on trailheads, to encourage people to be safe while enjoying these amenities."
 At Westminster Hills this past Saturday, April 4, the park was so popular that one visitor avoided it during prime time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.; at 3 p.m., though, the parking lots were still nearly full. He estimates that around 100 people and their dogs were present. But because the park is so huge, and since its paths are typically eight to ten feet wide, social distancing was possible -- a good thing, because face masks were definitely not common apparel.
 For more alternatives, Colorado Parks and Wildlife is encouraging folks to try out its COTREX app (see our June 2019 post about the state's top easy hiking trails) to find dog-friendly trails near them. Many of the routes require dogs to be leashed, and CPW has published trail safety guidelines specifically with COVID-19 in mind. But at least they offer different scenery than walking through your neighborhood again -- or crossing yellow caution tape.
