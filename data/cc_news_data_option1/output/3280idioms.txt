It was not immediately clear which of the agreements had been suspended and which had been formally ended, although other Western nations that have taken similar actions have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong.


  The administration has already acted to end special trade and commercial privileges that Hong Kong had enjoyed and has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including Hong Kong's pro-China leader Carrie Lam, involved in enforcing the new security law.


  Beijing had promised Hong Kong 50 years of a “one-country, two-systems” arrangement granting the city its own customs territory and legal system after the 1997 handover. They were underpinned by Western-style civil liberties, such as the right to public dissent, that are rarely allowed on the Chinese mainland and are now strictly limited in Hong Kong.


  “President Trump has made clear that the United States will, therefore, treat Hong Kong as ‘one country, one system’ and take action against individuals who have crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,” Ortagus said in the statement.


  Wednesday's actions are the latest in a string of actions the administration has taken targeting China as tensions between the two nations rise over trade, technology, Taiwan, Tibet, the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic. The impact of the tensions has been felt in the tit for tat closures of diplomatic missions as well as visa restrictions on students and journalists.

BOONEVILLE - United States Sen. John Boozman anticipates further hospital assistance from government officials is on the way.
   
 Boozman, during a meeting Tuesday morning with healthcare workers at Mercy Hospital-Booneville, said he anticipates legislation at state and federal levels is coming "soon" to hospitals in Arkansas. He said he expects the legislation will provide assistance to hospitals while enabling them to continue measures that have worked during the pandemic.
   
 Logan County on Tuesday afternoon had 105 active COVID-19 cases. This total follows an outbreak at the Booneville Human Development Center, which at one point reported 66 active cases between staff and clients. Dr. Syed Hamed reported at least six people required hospitalization from that outbreak.
   
 Mercy officials at the meeting said rural hospitals like Mercy-Booneville allow for patients in their communities that contract COVID-19 to receive treatment without being moved to larger communities like Fort Smith.
   
 Boozman said lawmakers are looking at the future functions of hospitals and healthcare professionals in light of needs that have been uncovered during the pandemic. He said he wants rural communities to keep healthcare so they can provide services to people in proximity.
   
 Mercy officials told Boozman they would like to see aspects of healthcare during COVID-19 such as telemedicine and the waiving of medicare replacement policies to stay the same.
   
 "The way you can help us is, as you're doing now, keep giving us a list as to what you've found helpful, because we really have been able to move quickly from the government compared to how we have in the past with these emergency declarations, which really makes your life easier," Boozman said.
   
 Boozman said the federal government is spending "a tremendous amount of money" on COVID-19 testing.
   
 Mercy-Fort Smith Medical Affairs Chief Dr. Paul Bean said testing is one of Mercy's "biggest barriers" because of how it affects staff and supplies.
   
 "Any help you can give us there will be greatly appreciated," Bean told Boozman.
   
 Boozman said rural hospitals like Mercy-Booneville also help communities maintain and improve services and quality of life in their communities.
   
 "It's tough in rural America right now," he said. "We're going to do everything we can to make sure our community hospitals operate."

 Pandemic or not, animal hoarding isn't a new thing. Sometimes it's worse than others. She thinks often about a rescue she did last February in Mesa.
 "It was a lady who was probably about 70 years old," Pruitt-Chastain said with a sigh. "She'd been dead for three weeks. There were dead dogs on the couch, dead cats, the house was so unbearable that a hazmat team had to come clean before we could go in. The lady hadn't spoken to anyone in like 10 years. The thing people forget is that animal hoarding is usually about mental illness. We need to learn to keep closer tabs on our mentally ill."
 Meanwhile, there are cats that need Pruitt-Chastain's help. "We've adopted 10 of the Peoria kitties so far," she reported. "Now we need to get the others spayed, neutered, microchipped, vaccinated. All the stars really aligned around us rescuing them. But now the work really begins."

LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA, Spain (AP) — Spanish authorities on Wednesday located a boat near the Canary Islands with dead migrants on board, some floating in sea water the vessel took on.
 The Spanish Maritime Rescue Service said there were around 10 bodies on the boat.
 The shipwreck was spotted by a plane as it searched for a missing boat that had left Mauritania on Aug. 15 with around 40 people on board and was believed to be heading to the Spanish islands off northwest Africa.
 Two Spanish rescue service vessels reached the shipwreck about 150 kilometers (85 miles) south of the island of Gran Canaria. They were waiting for Guardia Civil police officers to arrive and remove the bodies, providing an exact number of deaths.
 The route from western Africa to Spain’s Canary Islands is notoriously dangerous but in recent times has increasingly attracted migrants wanting to reach European soil, as authorities on Mediterranean routes have cracked down on migrant boats.
 Since August last year, at least 357 migrants have died trying to reach the Canary islands, according to the U.N. migration agency.
 So far this year, more than 3,500 migrants have arrived in the archipelago, the Spanish Interior Ministry says.
 In the Mediterranean Sea, meanwhile, Spanish authorities on Wednesday reported 99 migrants had been rescued at sea, with another 23 arriving in Mallorca under their own steam.

In most normal years, the third weekend of the preseason because that is the final week the starters play. This year is a little different. But we want to schedule the draft as close to the start of the season so you can be as up-to-date as possible.

When two men got into an argument Monday night at a bus stop along Aurora, and one allegedly shot and killed the other, it marked a harsh milestone for our city — as well as yet another reason to rue the year 2020.
 It was the 28th homicide this year, matching the number for all of last year. We’re only in August.
 Through the end of July this year, Seattle had seen eight more homicides than during the same period last year (an increase of 44 percent, though that's off a low base). In the past decade, when Seattle was enjoying one of its most peaceful stretches in our history, it had lows of just 19 homicides multiple times. This year, we passed that in June.
 We haven't heard much about this from City Hall.
 The phenomenon is happening in cities across the nation. These include the biggies, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, but also relatively safer cities such as Cincinnati, Nashville and Tulsa, all where homicide is up double digits.
 It’s especially unusual because most crime this year is down. In Seattle, rape and robbery are both down more than 10 percent (maybe due to fewer people out and about in the pandemic). Theft is down 17 percent.
 Some crimes that used to drive Seattle crazy — like car smash and grabs — have dropped off the map. Car prowls are down nearly 30 percent since the pandemic hit in March, compared to last year, according to Seattle police reports.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong covering extradition and tax exemptions, the latest in a series of U.S. moves in response to China’s imposition of strict national security laws over the former British territory."The Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy of the people of Hong Kong," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. The State Department cited Beijing's violation of its pledge for Hong Kong to retain broad autonomy for 50 years after its 1997 reversion to Chinese rule. President Donald Trump already had determined that Hong Kong was no longer eligible for the continued preferential treatment it enjoyed from the U.S. The three agreements cover the surrender of fugitives, transfer and convicted prisoners and reciprocal tax exemptions on income from international shipping."These steps underscore our deep concern regarding Beijing's decision to impose the National Security Law, which has crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong," State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. She said Hong Kong authorities had been notified earlier Wednesday of the decisions that were the result the Chinese Communist Party's "drastic steps to erode the high degree of autonomy that Beijing itself promised" to Hong Kong. It was not immediately clear which of the agreements had been suspended and which had been formally ended, although other Western nations that have taken similar actions have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong.The administration has already acted to end special trade and commercial privileges that Hong Kong had enjoyed and has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including Hong Kong's pro-China leader Carrie Lam, involved in enforcing the new security law.Beijing had promised Hong Kong 50 years of a "one-country, two-systems" arrangement granting the city its own customs territory and legal system after the 1997 handover. They were underpinned by Western-style civil liberties, such as the right to public dissent, that are rarely allowed on the Chinese mainland and are now strictly limited in Hong Kong. "President Trump has made clear that the United States will, therefore, treat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system' and take action against individuals who have crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong," Ortagus said in the statement.Wednesday's actions are the latest in a string of actions the administration has taken targeting China as tensions between the two nations rise over trade, technology, Taiwan, Tibet, the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic. The impact of the tensions has been felt in the tit for tat closures of diplomatic missions as well as visa restrictions on students and journalists.The latest U.S. steps also come as Trump assigns full blame to Beijing for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., deflecting criticism of his own handling of the pandemic that threatens his reelection.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
