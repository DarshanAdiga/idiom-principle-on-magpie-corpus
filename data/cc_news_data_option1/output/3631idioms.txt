Hay un estudio que podría explicar lo de las mujeres. Hoy todo es colectivo. La gente que te ayuda, tus afectos, los periodistas que buscan la verdad te dan la autoestima necesaria para dirigir la empresa. A mí me sucede lo mismo. Si nos pensáramos en forma individual, nos estaríamos mintiendo. Si estoy acá es por los científicos, los neurólogos, por René Favaloro, por mi familia, mis amigos. Mi asistente y tu asistente organizaron esto. La dinámica de los equipos es algo estudiado. Ya no hay más Leonardos Da Vincis. Hay factores que predicen el éxito de un equipo. Primero, que sus miembros tengan altos niveles de empatía. El segundo factor es que, además del líder, haya otras voces dominantes. El líder no va a ser reemplazado por tecnología. Su rol es imaginar el futuro. Tiene que estar dispuesto a tomar riesgos y representar al grupo. No hay liderazgo si no se representa al grupo. Yo no podría ser líder de la Asociación de Arquitectos porque no soy arquitecto. El liderazgo ya no pasa tanto como antes con el carisma o el poder o la herencia, sino por la representación. Incluso, hay que vestirse como los representados. De hecho, Mahatma Ghandi se vestía no como cuando estudiaba en Inglaterra o trabajaba en Sudáfrica, sino como un hindú. El tercer factor que predice el éxito del equipo es la diversidad de género. Se estudió por qué: las mujeres rinden más en ciertos test de empatía. Lo del cuidado tiene alguna base científica.

How crazy has this gardening season been? First, we had an early spring freeze that damaged some of the fruit crops and early spring flowers. Then we had a killing frost June 8. Then we go from high temperatures in the upper 80s to freezing temperatures in a matter of a day.
 Would it be an understatement to say this has been one crazy year? I think most people are actually anxious to see this hot, windy, smoky gardening season come to an end.
 But the great thing about gardening is that we grow through the experiences and challenges and roll up our sleeves and say, “better luck next year.” So, let’s talk about some of the things that may have occurred in your landscape and how to overcome them next season.
 The average first light frost date of 32 degrees is Oct. 7 in the Montrose area. I hope you didn’t get nipped by the frost earlier this week. I know many people covered their gardens just in case. Regardless, root crops and cold hardy vegetables should be just fine. Translucent colored tomatoes and peppers signal they were definitely hit by the frost and are history, but those that survived the cold could be picked and kept in a cool location to ripen. Did you know that some apples actually become even sweeter following a light frost, so there may be some good in the craziness?
 Last year we had a hard freeze with temperatures around 13 degrees on Oct. 11. This actually froze the leaves right onto the trees. When spring rolled around, the leaves were still clinging to some of the trees. Most trees managed to put on new growth and overcame.
 However, I still see a lot of trees, especially maples, that still look discolored and a little deformed on the east side of the tree. These trees are going to go into winter a little stressed, so you might want to keep an eye on them during the winter months and make sure they don’t become too dry. A good soaking before the irrigation is blown out for the season will help.
 Pinions had a rough summer with Ips beetle attacks. If your tree was one of the unfortunate ones to be attacked and is dead, or mostly dead, remove it this fall or winter. The beetles over winter will be in the infested trees and will emerge next spring. Because they’re attracted to fresh cut wood, this is one job you don’t want to put off until next spring since it will attract beetles to your remaining pinions and even your neighbor’s trees.
 Just in case you ran into a few setbacks in your garden this season, perhaps this may help. If your potatoes or cucumbers have a hollow center, it’s due to nothing more than uneven watering. Mulching and trying to keep the soil from becoming too dry or wet will help prevent the problem next season.
 Some varieties of cucumbers are more prone to “hollow heart,” so if this is a continual problem, you might want to check the seed packet next spring to choose a variety that is less prone to hollow heart.
 Maybe you’ve experienced bitter tasting cucumbers. This is also a result of dry soil or the cucumber becoming too mature. Once again, mulching and consistent watering will help alleviate this problem in the future.
 Carrots that appear to have “multiple legs” are another common problem. This can happen if your soil is compacted. The poor little carrot wants to grow deep and straight, but the soil is just too hard. Amending the soil in the spring or planting cover crops this fall will help improve the soil and allow you to grow happy carrots in the future. You may want to choose shorter carrot varieties until your soil improves.
 This is definitely apple season, but worms in apples are probably the biggest problem that gardeners have when growing fruit. Spraying the apples for coddling moths a couple times throughout the growing season should solve this problem in the future. Traps can be somewhat effective but coddling moth control needs to begin shortly after the flowers fall from the tree next spring.
 If the skin on your apples looks like they have a road map of tan patterns or if your pears have dark crusty areas, it could be the result of powdery mildew. Spraying the tree with dormant oil next spring and raking up the leaves this fall will help next year’s crop.
 It’s time to reduce the amount of water your Austrian pines, peach and globe willows are receiving. Reducing the water signals the tree to start shutting down for winter.
 This is a great time to divide and transplant crowded spring and early summer blooming perennials. However, iris and lilies should be transplanted after they’re done blooming in the spring.
 If you managed to get through this year of gardening with a green lawn and healthy plants, give yourself a great big pat on the back. You overcame a bunch of obstacles and deserve a big “way to go!” If you weren’t quite so fortunate, don’t give up. Challenges keep it interesting.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A judge has ruled that rapper Kanye West was correctly left off the presidential ballot in the key swing state of Wisconsin. The ruling Friday upholds a decision by the state elections commission. It is likely to be rapidly appealed to the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court, which put the mailing of absentee ballots on hold Thursday. The court put the mailing of ballots on hold while it considers whether Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins should be put on the ballot. The delay comes in the face of a state deadline of Thursday to mail ballots to more than 1 million voters who had requests on file.

President Nicolas Maduro said Friday that an "American spy" had been arrested near two Venezuelan refineries, after authorities foiled a plot to "cause an explosion" at another oil complex.
 "Yesterday we captured... an American spy who was spying in Falcon state on the Amuay and Cardon refineries," Maduro said in a televised address.
 According to Maduro the individual was "a marine who was serving as a marine at CIA bases in Iraq" and who was captured with "heavy weapons" and "large amounts of cash."
 The arrest, he said, occurred after authorities on Wednesday "discovered and dismantled" a "plan to cause an explosion" at El Palito refinery -- the closest to Caracas -- located in Carabobo state.
 Maduro did not say, however, where the individual was being held.
 Last month two former US soldiers, Luke Alexander Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41, were sentenced to 20 years in prison in Venezuela on charges including terrorism, after a failed bid to invade the Caribbean country last May.
 Just hours before Friday's announcement, the Venezuelan government said it was establishing an "emergency plan" intended to regulate "fuel distribution" in light of severe gasoline shortages in the country, where people wait in lines stretching miles (kilometers) to fuel up their vehicles.
 Venezuela suffers fuel shortages despite having the largest proven oil reserves in the world.
 The petroleum industry was the cornerstone of Venezuela's economy a century ago, but production has fallen to a fraction of the 3.2 million barrels per day produced just over a decade ago.

Sam Burns, looking for his first career PGA Tour win in his 61st start, holds a two-shot lead at the midpoint of the Safeway Open in Napa, Calif.
 Burns opened with a par and then a double bogey but produced nine birdies and seven pars the rest of the way for a 7-under-par 65 at Silverado Resort &amp; Spa's North Course. That leaves him at 15-under 129 through two rounds.
 Harry Higgs produced the best round of the tournament so far, a 10-under 62 on Friday, and he sits in second place at 13 under. He concluded his round with a double eagle.
 D.J. Trahan (second-round 65), Australia's Cameron Percy (round 68) and Scotland's Russell Knox (69) are tied for third at 12 under.
 James Hahn (65) and Doug Ghim (66) share sixth place at 11 under, a stroke ahead of Rob Oppenheim (66), Brian Stuard (67), Tom Hoge (68) and Pat Perez (69).
 Burns started on the back nine, and he put his second shot on the 11th hole into the water, leading to the double bogey. He responded with birdies on each of the next three holes and never had a miscue again the rest of the round.
 Burns said of his one poor hole, "I think it (ticked) me off a little bit, woke me up, I guess. It was early, cold. It was kind of like it picked me up, like hey, let's go. Just kind of stuck with it and the golf course opened up for me the rest of the day."
 Asked about shooting for his initial tour win, the 24-year-old Louisiana native said, "There's no timeline for me. I'm just going to try to keep improving, keep getting better, trying to go off of my stats from last year and see where I can get better, so just going to see if I can continue to do that and see what happens."
 Higgs' highlight was holing his 230-yard second shot on the par-5 ninth hole.
 "I hit my 4-iron solid, it drew a little bit, landed short, rolled in the hole," Higgs said. "What a wonderful way to end the day and also just really weird. Being the last hole, it's so final. OK, well, cool."
 In terms of his round as a whole, Higgs said, "There are a few more that I would like to have, I left a couple short throughout the day, which just -- but you can't complain, I just shot 62. If I complain, no one's going to listen."
 Among the players who missed the cut in the opener of the 2020-21 PGA Tour season was Jordan Spieth, who wound up at 1-over 143 after rounds of 73 and 70. He double-bogeyed his final hole, but it wasn't a difference-maker, and he fell four strokes below the cut line.
 Spain's Sergio Garcia (3 under on Friday and overall) also missed the cut.
