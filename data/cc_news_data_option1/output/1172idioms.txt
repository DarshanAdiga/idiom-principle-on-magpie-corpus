India Inc on Tuesday said the government's move to extend the deadline for filing income tax and GST returns and raise threshold of default that could trigger insolvency of a company would help businesses, especially MSMEs, tide over the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak. At a press conference on Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government has waived charges on cash withdrawals from ATMs of other banks as a precursor to a broader stimulus package for the economy distressed by the coronavirus outbreak.
 "Waiver of penalty, late fee and interest on GST will also help industry cope up with the huge cash crunch, and thus, tide through these tough times," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said. Deloitte India Partner M S Mani said the extension of GST return filing timelines together with the deferment of e-invoicing and new returns announced earlier would allow businesses to focus on resumption of business processes once normalcy resumes in future.
 Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY, said, "Extended time for payment under the Sabka Vishwas Scheme as well is a welcome measure as companies were struggling for making the payment in the lockdown scenario." Assocham President Niranjan Hiranandani said the industry looks forward for the broader economic packages like One time Roll Over for debt restructuring across the industries to be announced soon for resurrecting its economic health. "These proactive steps are the need of the hour to mitigate some of the hardships that the businesses are going through," said Sohinder Gill, director general, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles.
 Suntuity Renewable Energy India Director (Operations) Imaan Javan said, "We express relief towards the finance minister's move of extending the date of filing IT and GST returns from March 31, 2020, to June 30, 2020. The decision taken by the finance minister is a timely move considering that the economy is on its knees as of now" said. The last date for filing income tax returns for 2018-19 as well as that for linking PAN with Aadhaar has been extended by three months to June 30. The last date for filing GST annual returns for 2018-19, which is due on March 31, has also been extended till the last week of June.
 As the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns across cities create large-scale economic disruption, Sitharaman announced that the threshold of loan default that could trigger insolvency proceedings has been raised to Rs 1 crore from the existing Rs 1 lakh now. With lockdowns restricting movements, the government waived a minimum balance fee on the savings bank account as well as allow charge-free withdrawals from any bank ATM for three months. Also, bank charges for digital trade transactions for all trade finance consumers have been reduced.
 For companies, it relaxed mandatory requirement of holding meetings of the board of directors by 60 days and waived the fee for late filings during the moratorium period. Stating that the announcements done on Tuesday were to ease the burden of compliance on citizens during the lockdown period, Sitharaman said an economic relief package was in the works and it will be announced "sooner rather than later".

Maybe it's because our family has been spending so much time together in close quarters since the coronavirus pandemic began, but I've been reflecting at length on family stories from years ago. The crowds that recently stripped supermarket shelves bare remind me of the shortages during World War II that my parents remembered. My dad took great pride in the fact that his father, Mike Cuneo, general manager of Erie's Armour Meat Packing plant, never got rich during the war. My father would say that his dad had ready access to the most valuable commodity of all - meat. Yet he never tried to use it to make an extra buck. Oh, he did supply one local family, the Mead family, with hams and roasts, and they, in turn, hired a 16-year-old kid in the Erie Times sports department. Since eight Cuneos, myself included, worked at the newspaper in various capacities in succeeding years, I guess you could say Armour's wartime beef and pork paid off. You can see why I've never been opposed to nepotism. ... That so many area restaurants, closed by law in recent days, are offering takeout service also made me think of the times that Dad babysat for my sister and brothers and me when our mom was away. He never drove a car, which meant he was on a first-name basis with every cabbie in town. Instead of making dinner himself, he would order Greek hot dogs from the New York Lunch, or spaghetti from Hector's, and have it delivered by cab. I must have been pretty young back then, or pretty stupid, because I could never get over what great cooks they had at the Yellow Cab Co. ... Everyone says life will be forever changed when the virus finally departs, and perhaps takeout food will remain popular. Jack and Stephanie Potus Eaker, who've run restaurants and their Make It Fabulous Catering business for years, are offering fresh meals to go - starting today. Their new storefront, located at the corner of West Sixth and Cranberry streets, will offer a different menu every Monday that will be good through Friday. ... I feel for my friends in the restaurant business, who will be under terrific economic pressure for the foreseeable future. The profit margins in the business are already tight, and to be closed for any length of time could be devastating. ... The TV networks keep airing the quick interview with the obviously tipsy college kid on Florida's beaches. He tells the reporter that if he falls victim to the coronavirus, so be it. It won't interfere with his partying. Tens of thousands of viewers despise the kid for his insensitivity, but he reminds me of a time when I was so young and blissfully unaware. ... Doug Yaple, who runs a popular vacuum cleaner shop and repair center on East 38th Street, wants his customers to know that he's still in business. His relatives, who run Yaple's Vacuum Cleaner and Sewing Machine Center at West 26th and Liberty streets, are thinking of retiring. ... With so much time indoors, I finally read Ron Chernow's excellent biography of George Washington. It's fascinating in so many respects, but the fact that Washington's mother really disliked him is amazing. Maybe it was her cherry tree that George chopped down. ... Churchill Downs rescheduled the Kentucky Derby, originally set for the first Saturday in May, for Sept. 5, which I'm sure is disappointing to Erie native Jim Webb and his partners, who own Tiz the Law. The horse, currently ranked as the leading contender for the Derby, is said to be suffering from a bruised foot, which would give it time to recover, but other major stakes races are scheduled for later this summer. Of course, who knows if any of the races will take place. Keeneland, in Lexington, Kentucky, cancelled its spring meeting last week. For my money, Keeneland and Saratoga in August offer the nation's best horse racing. ... When a Joe Biden backer recently told a supporter of President Donald Trump that the pandemic has ruined the president's chances for re-election, the Trump supporter noted: "You will recall that the mayor of Amity in the first "Jaws" film was still the mayor in "Jaws 2." ... I don't want to say that I miss watching professional sports on TV, but on Thursday I sat through a replay of a Cubs-Phillies game from May of 1979. The Phillies won in 10 innings, 23-22. ... My heart goes on to the brides who must cut back their weddings to immediate family members. It takes so much planning to put on a big wedding that this must seem like a terrible disappointment. On the other hand, the wedding isn't as nearly as important as the marriage.

The government has done micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) a good turn by upping the threshold limit for initiating insolvency proceedings 100 times to ₹1 crore, say experts. Further, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s observation that in case the Covid-19 situation persists beyond April 30, section 7, section 9 and section 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) could be suspended for six months, will assure companies that they will be given time to recover from COVID-related impact.
 Section 7 of IBC deals with initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) by financial creditor; section 9 and section 10 deal with the initiation of CIRP by operational creditors and corporate applicants, respectively.
 According to Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings, increasing the threshold limit to ₹1 crore will provide respite to micro and small enterprises thatare struggling to come to terms with the Covid-19 lockdown and may default on their payment obligations due to circumstantial exigencies.
 “Suspension of section 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC in case of prolonged challenges from the Covid-19 lockdown will do away with initiation of insolvency resolution proceedings against defaulting corporates.
 “This will provide a breather for entities who may have defaulted due to the Covid-19 challenges and give them a recovery opportunity once the situation normalises,” he said.
 Suman Chowdhury, President – Ratings, Acuité Ratings & Research, observed that the increase in default threshold for IBC applicability from ₹1 lakh to ₹1 crore will act as a protection for MSMEs in the current crisis period.
 Referring to the intent to suspend creditor rights on corporate insolvency for a temporary six-month period, Chowdhury said this will arrest any possible move by lenders to proceed under the IBC in a scenario where corporate asset quality has already seen stress due to the continuing economic slowdown, and is being further aggravated by the Covid-led lockdown.
 Manish Aggarwal, Partner and Head - Infrastructure M&A, and Special Situations Group, KPMG in India, said: “The need to revisit key operative sections of the IBC at an appropriate time to avoid large-scale insolvencies is appreciated. However, there is an urgent need to address the entire restructuring and resolution framework that exists at present to facilitate large-scale restructurings and to avoid insolvencies.”
 Aggarwal felt that sector-specific measures, cash flow, and liquidity enhancement measures are first needed to ensure that businesses can withstand this tough period. This, in the real sense, will avoid insolvency situations.
 Stoppage of process towards insolvency is necessary, but not a sufficient condition to address fundamental issues facing the business environment, he added.
