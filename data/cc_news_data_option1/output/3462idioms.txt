Box office reports are a thing that's happening again, but they don't exactly read the same way they used to. Box office totals are a fraction of what they were, because in many places theaters aren't even open. And box office numbers don't even tell the whole story that they once did because many films are being released in homes either instead of theatrical releases or in addition to them. _Bill and_ Ted _Face the Music_ had itself a pretty solid opening weekend all things considered. While the film made only a fraction of what _The New Mutants_ did in theaters this past weekend, it's putting up a strong showing via Premium VOD services.

Several planned restrictions on the sale of tobacco will no longer go into effect in the New Hope. The City Council opted, on a 4-1 vote, to drop some regulations on pharmacies and tobacco shops in response to threatened litigation.
 The City Council adopted a long list of tobacco-related regulations in late May but decided to reconsider in late July after an attorney contacted the city on behalf of the New Hope Smoke Shop. The attorney argued that imposing a ban on flavored tobacco in age-restricted tobacco shops was a redundant measure, as youth are prohibited from the stores.
 The council met in a closed session Aug. 17 to discuss the litigation and potential amendments to the ordinance, which included removing the flavor ban on tobacco shops. There were two other reversals from the ordinance adopted in May: Retail locations with pharmacies will remain able to sell tobacco products (a ban was planned), and distribution of samples will be allowed at age-restricted shops.
 All three of the reversals were discussed by business owners when the council decided to reconsider the regulations in July. A spokesperson for Hy-Vee had contested the ban of sales on facilities with a pharmacy (Hy-Vee has a pharmacy and sells tobacco products), and a spokesperson for the Midwest Vapor Coalition discussed the negative effects of a ban on e-cigarette liquid sampling in age-restricted stores.
 Councilmember Jonathan London said he was uncomfortable with the leniency given to the businesses that threatened litigation while charging all license holders the same fees.
 “The state law wasn’t to ban flavored products,” he said. “We’re going above and beyond what the state law is asking us to do ... we’re creating an unlevel playing field. Discriminating, really.”
 London proposed the regulations be dropped, except for those that align with recent state and federal laws that raise the minimum purchasing age to 21. London was an opponent of the regulations when the May ordinance passed and voted against the passage in favor of monitoring the effects of ordinances passed in other cities.
 City Attorney Stacy Woods said Minneapolis, Duluth, St. Paul and Robbinsdale have similar allowances for age-restricted tobacco shops.
 Councilmember Cedrick Frazier, a supporter of the initial round of regulations, said he approved of the changes in light of the lawsuit threat.
 “For me, I didn’t want to take a machete when we could’ve used a scalpel,” Frazier said of the regulations. He said, in conversation with owners of convenience stores and gas stations, he had learned that tobacco revenue wasn’t as vital as it was in age-restricted stores. “I think they [gas stations and convenience stores] have other avenues to draw in revenue and resources.”

After not playing a spring season, due to the COVID-19 cancellation, the boys on the Hopkins Flyers 19-and-under baseball team made up for lost time this summer.
 Over the course of seven weeks, the Flyers played 37 games and finished 10 games above the .500 mark at 23-13-1.
 “I am happy with how the season went,” head coach Tyler Brodersen said. “The players were just happy to get back on the field. We played well, considering we had only six seniors on the team and only three players with varsity playing time under their belts. Next summer, we will have a core group of 10 or 11 players who can some back.”
 While the Flyers had a balanced team, there were several players who consistently stood out.
 One is pitcher Ryan McGie, who will be a senior at Hopkins High this fall.
 “Ryan had a breakout summer,” Brodersen said. “When he threw strikes, he was basically unhittable.”
 The highlight of McGie’s summer was a 10-0 shutout of an Excelsior team that won the season-ending Metro Invitational.
 “The biggest thing with Ryan is his competitive fire,” Brodersen said. “He throws the ball hard and in the zone.”
 Jake Perry, another key player who will be a senior this fall, showed his skills at shortstop this summer. Perry’s natural position is catcher, however, the Flyers had the luxury of playing him at short due to the emergence of another catcher, Jack Mausser, who will be a junior at Hopkins High in the fall.
 “Going into the season, we weren’t sure what our catching situation would be,” Brodersen said. “Jack was one of our best hitters along with Jake. Those guys did a ton.”
 Among the seniors on the Flyers roster, no one stood out more than Joey Hurth, who has signed to play for Indiana State University next season. The highlight of Hurth’s summer was pitching a perfect game, and he was also a very solid hitter.
 Zach Paskoff was the wildcard for Hopkins. He attended high school at a boarding school in the Chicago area before coming home and playing summer ball for Hopkins.
 “Zach showed good power with three home runs and led us in OPS,” Brodersen pointed out.
 Another key senior, infielder Kyle Feduccia, gave the team both experience and leadership. He had been a starter for the Hopkins High team that finished sixth in the 2019 Class 4A state tournament.
 Nick Kanitz is the only college freshman who came back to play for the Flyers this summer. He was among the pitching leaders and also a key man in the outfield.
 Jason Schumacher and David Campbell, both senior pitchers, were solid. Schumacher also logged time in the outfield and Campbell saw duty as a first baseman.
 “At some high schools, Jason and David might have been two or three-year starters,” Brodersen said. “Jason really developed as a pitcher this season, and David is a great leader and likely to be a future coach.”
 While the season was filled with highlights, the Flyers’ best game, other than the 10-0 victory over Excelsior, might have been the final game of the season, a 25-7 win over the Minneapolis South Tigers.
 In addition to a season-high run total, the Flyers had 17 hits.
 Schumacher had his best night of the year, going 3-for-4 with three runs scored and two RBIs. Mausser, Perry, Paskoff and Cole Anderson had two hits each, while Paul Safranski, Ryder Lane, Jackson View, Americo Sculati, Campbell and Kanitz each had one hit.
 Campbell started on the mound and was the winner with relief help from Paskoff and Kanitz.
 Looking to next season, Brodersen and many others around the state are waiting for the Minnesota State High School League to set the dates for its baseball season, which is expected to run into June and maybe even July.
 “I fully intend to have a full Legion [19U] schedule in the time that’s allowed,” Brodersen said. “We have the kind of team that could be playing deep into August.”

Bill And Ted Face The Music Broke A Surprising World Record

But the other part of the box office equation which is new is that box office success likely won't strictly come in the first couple of weeks of release as has been the pattern in the past. Movies like _Bill and Ted Face the Music_ and _The New Mutants_ are expected to build their box office numbers slowly over a period of weeks. As theaters reopen in places where they are closed or as viewers become more comfortable with the idea of visiting theaters, people may finally go see movies after they've technically been open for weeks.

 Since the District 4 spot was vacant before the election, the City Council voted to have Henry join the group at its Sept. 14 meeting instead of waiting until November.
 “It's great that all five districts in the city will be heard once again,” Henry said.
 Marks said he is excited to have Henry join the City Council, saying she will add not only female representation but the “intelligence of a business owner.”
 “We have a lot of projects going on, and we're getting ready to do our budgets,” he said. “We are ready to hit the ground running.”

_Bill and Ted Face the Music_ is much better reviewed than _The New Mutants_ though it's maybe not a shock that the X-Men film saw better returns in theaters as it's the bigger "blockbuster" full of superheroes that feels like the movie people might want to see on a big screen.

All the interviewers sat behind an oval-shaped office table with their legs covered by the huge table. I sat next to one of the interviewers. As I was about to respond to the MD by capitulating, I felt the interviewer seated next to me stretched out his leg under the table towards my direction and stepped on my toes in a very sharp and hard way. It was so hard I winced and looked at his direction. On his face I could read the word ‘no’ etched indelibly on his face. He also shook his head slightly. I got the message. I looked at the MD and declined the offer he gave me respectfully. I told him I would love to have what I asked for initially. I stood my ground.

Two sisters are moving out and selling their North Bay home after it was broken into, and food and clothing were stolen while they were away this past weekend.
 "I received a call Saturday morning from a North Bay police officer who informed me that my house had been broken into," reports Leslie, who requested she not be identified. "We were an hour away so it was not a fun ride back home to say the least."
 Leslie said she later learned a neighbour heard banging at about 2 a.m.
 "My neighbour couldn't figure out what it was about," she says. "At 8:30 a.m. while she was outside having a smoke she saw a lady leaving my home and jumping on her bike."
 When Leslie and her sister arrived at their McPhail Street home, they were shocked to discover significant damage.
 "The police took us around the home to show us. They (the culprits) gained access through our garage that leads to our mud room. They kicked in the door to get into our home. The door had been locked with a deadbolt," she says.
 "They ripped apart my cupboards, right off the hinges. You can't even walk anywhere in my house because there is stuff everywhere."
 One of the worst discoveries was finding a Purolator package ripped open with her dead cat's footprint in it.
 Thankfully, Leslie says, the keepsake was still inside.
 "I would have just lost it if that had been taken," she admits. "They went through everything. I haven't been back in my room. I can't bear to see it in shambles."
 Leslie and her sister told police the stolen items included grandmother's engagement ring.
 "I don't think it had much value, but it had a lot of sentimental value."
 Leslie says the thieves took clothing, shoes, makeup and women's sanitary products, light bulbs, food and costume jewelry.
 "The beds weren't the way we left them and, to make matters worse, they left their dirty towels in the bathroom."
 Leslie says she contacted The Nugget to raise awareness of the issue.
 "It's so much more than just a bunch of bikes getting stolen," she says. "Homes are getting broken into now. It's a complete invasion of my privacy."
 What's more, Leslie says, her luggage was used to store stolen food and clothing in her backyard.
 "I imagine they were coming back later to get it," she says. "I'm 39 years old and I own this house with my sister. We are now going to sell it. I just don't feel safe anywhere."
 Calls to the investigating officer weren't returned by deadline.

LATHROP, MO (KCTV) -- Two high school football teams just outside of the metro area are under quarantine and have halted football activities after a coach tested positive for COVID-19 and players started having symptoms.
 Lathrop High School and Richmond High School both announced Tuesday morning that they were taking steps for safety after a Lathrop coach tested positive for COVID-19. Players are also experiencing symptoms and waiting on test results, according to the Lathrop School District.
 Lathrop and Richmond played a high school football game against each other last Friday.
 As a result, Lathrop has quarantined its entire coaching staff and paused football practices for the time being. The school district is asking parents to monitor their kids for possible COVID-19 symptoms. Lathrop also announced its high school is going full online starting immediately.
