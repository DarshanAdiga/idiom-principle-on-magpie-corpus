At first, masks were said to be overkill for ordinary people and should be conserved for health workers only. Later, experts recommended masks only for people exhibiting symptoms. A month later in April, it became clear that many cases of COVID-19 were asymptomatic, which contributed greatly to the rapid and quiet spread of the virus. Then some countries, including Turkey, mandated the use of masks, especially in crowded areas and when physical distancing was difficult. A practice the WHO was a bit late to adopt.

The airport grounds are covered in pebbles poured on the area. There is neither a tower nor ground staff here. There is no runway determined by lines. You have to completely rely on the pilot&#39;s experience when the plane is landing and taking off. The team was split into two at the airport. One part was transported to the ship by helicopter and the others by boats. I was on the helicopter team. Since the ship was already very close to the shore, the journey was quite short. When we reached the ship, with the other part of the crew, we had a small meeting and settled into our cabins where we would stay throughout the trip. The cabins accommodated three to four people but were quite narrow.

It is beneficial to remind of one subject here. The area where these measurements are made is King George Island.

At the end of five days after the journey began in Istanbul, we finally set foot in Antarctica. As we went down the plane&#39;s stairs, we encountered the same scene that reminded us of the announcement made inside the plane. Instead of stepping directly on the continent after reaching the bottom step of the stairs, we first cleaned the bottoms of our shoes in a special solution. The aim of this is to prevent us from harming the continent with any pollutants we may have brought with us.

Antarctica has an area of 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles). About 98% is covered with ice. It is the fifth-largest continent in the world. It is the largest desolate region in the world. The highest wind speed to date was measured here at 327 kilometers per hour. The lowest temperature on Earth was recorded here as minus 94.7 C in 2013.

There are more than 100 scientific bases on the continent.

This revelation came to light only recently after more than 200 scientists in 32 countries penned a letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), urging the health agency to review and update its guidance on the coronavirus, complete with evidence that tiny airborne particles play a significant role in transmission. The general consensus so far had been that SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through droplets sprayed out from the nose and that these droplets quickly fell to the ground.

I say the journey &quot;begins&quot; only because the journey itself is a separate story. We met at Istanbul Airport at 6 a.m. sharp.
