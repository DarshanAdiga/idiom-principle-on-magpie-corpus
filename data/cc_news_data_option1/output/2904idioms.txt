Diana P. Kruszka Trudnak, 81, a resident of North Wilkes-Barre, passed into eternal life on Sunday afternoon, July 19, 2020, in the comfort of her residence with her beloved family at her bedside.
 Born Jan. 2, 1939, in Nanticoke, she was one of six children to the late Bruno and Frida Kosloski Kruszka. Educated in the Nanticoke schools, Mrs. Trudnak was a member of the 1956 graduating class of the former Nanticoke High School.
 Following her formal high school education, Diana worked as a sales floor lady for a downtown Nanticoke furniture store. After meeting and marrying her husband, Joe, she joined the family business, Trudy's Lunch, North Wilkes- Barre, where she became co-owner and operator. Her days were filled with taking care of the many folks from all over the valley who would come for breakfast and lunch, six days a week. At night, after tending to her children, she could be found in the family kitchen cooking for the next day's specials until the early morning hours. Diana was known far and wide for her pigs-in- the-blanket and her cream of potato soup. The couple retired from the restaurant business in 1978. After that, she was employed by the local garment industry until health issues caused her retirement in 1989.
 A devout Catholic, she was a member of Parish of St. Andre Bessette, North Wilkes-Barre, having worshiped at the former Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic Church and St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church prior to their closures and subsequent merger. At St. John's, she helped run the Catholic Daughters and was a member of the Altar and Rosary Society. She and Joe also helped run the parish 300 Club.
 In her spare time, Diana enjoyed playing cards, online games and puzzles while enjoying her television shows on the Game Show and Food networks. She was a huge fan of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
 She and her husband, Joseph, who shared 62 years of married life together on June 9, could be seen each week at the Saturday vigil Mass religiously. Diana is remembered as being a loving, devoted wife, mother, grandmother and great- grandmother to her adoring family. Her presence will be greatly missed by all those she touched in this life.
 Diana was preceded in death by two infant children, Donna Marie and Sharon Marie Trudnak; by an infant brother, Thomas Kruszka; brother Bruce Kruszka; and sister, Dorothy Brehm.
 Left to cherish the wonderful memories they hold of her in addition to her husband, Joe, at home, are her children, Joseph R. Trudnak Jr., North Wilkes- Barre; daughter, Pamela A. Dixon and her husband, Daniel Allport; grandchildren, Megan Furrow, her husband, Tyler, and their children, Oliver, Mason and Beckett; David Amos and his wife, Kristin, along with their children, Haylie and Natalie; sister, Patricia Boltz, Nanticoke; and brother, Jerry Kruszka, along with his wife, Peggy, Edwardsville; numerous nieces, nephews, in-laws, dear friends and her favorite feline fur brothers, Chip and Linus.
 Diana's family would like to gratefully acknowledge her doctor of 30 years, Dr. Frank C. Olshemski, her oncologist, Dr. Bruce Saidman, along with the nurses and staff of Allied Services in-home Hospice Care for their wonderful loving care.
 Memorial funeral services will be held privately and at the convenience of Mr. Trudnak and his family from the North Wilkes-Barre location of John V. Morris Family Funeral Homes Inc., 625 N. Main St., with a funeral Mass in St. Andre Bessette Parish, 668 N. Main St. The Rev. Kenneth M. Seegar, pastor, will serve as celebrant and leader of worship.

During the summer, my cooking takes a noticeable shift. I put traditional composed dishes — like, say, a lasagna or roast chicken with potatoes — on the back burner in favor of one-bowl vegetable grab-bags to eat all the peak- summer produce I can get my hands on. This salad is one of those dishes, and I’ll eat it over and over until the vegetables vanish from the markets.
 Okra is my favorite vegetable, summertime or not, and it’s teeming in farmers markets now. Fresh corn is a close second, its sweetness there to balance the okra’s verdancy. In California, mild, floral Jimmy Nardello peppers are a rare treat at this time of year; when I see them in the market, I buy a giant handful of the spindly, twisted chiles. And then, of course, we now have the best heirloom tomatoes, as soft as water balloons and begging to be eaten like apples while their juice bleeds down your arm.
 To transform them into dinner, I arrange thin wedges of those tomatoes on a platter and sprinkle them with sea salt and pepper to help draw out their moisture and season them deeply while I get on with cooking the rest of the ingredients. The okra, peppers and corn each get their turn in the skillet, stir-fried with a little olive oil until lightly blistered and tender. Some crisped spicy Italian sausage — full of chile heat and fennel seeds — adds meaty heft to the vegetables, while their rendered fat mingles with apple cider vinegar and minced garlic to tie the whole dish together.
 A scattering of basil leaves dresses up the dish and announces that this is _dinner_ , which, for the next few weeks, means a confetti bowl of the best ingredients summer has to offer.

In a written statement, SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride said the company supports California’s climate targets.
 “We are lucky to live in a state where innovation is prized and where consumers and businesses have access to a wide variety of clean energy options,” Gilbride said. “Our goal has always been to follow the [Public Utilities Commission] rules and to do the right thing for our customers and the communities we serve. That is why we are requesting the commission clarify its rules.
 “Given the importance of the SoCalGas system to keeping energy bills affordable, the electric grid reliable, and resilient, and to meeting the state’s environmental goals, these issues deserve a forum that promotes public participation and transparency.”

I was hoping that this would not happen here especially in Dougherty County from the virus being so prevalent here.”Coroner Michael Fowler asks anyone who was at the U.S 19 Dragway concert event over the weekend to quarantine.“I don’t know how much more of the people that might be affected by this virus, so the ones that were out there, I think they need to go get tested and if they start having some of the symptoms they need to go get checked,” said Fowler.As the summer kicks off many people will head to concerts and large gatherings. Fowler said people need to think twice before attending such events that host hundreds of people.“I don’t want to have to zip another person from the virus, you know people die from cancer, high blood pressure, and other things but not from the virus something that can be prevented,” said Fowler.Dougherty County Sheriff Kevin Sproul put in a cease and desist order to the manager, Bobby Childs, for failure to adhere to Gov.

_Solar Opposites_ has released a clip from Season 2 at Comic-Con 2020. A bunch of fans were wondering what Justin Roiland and company had in store during the show. Their patience was rewarded with some in-progress work and a general read of everything going on with the Hulu mega-hit. The clip sees the would-be family unit in their house. Korvo and Terry are enjoying a nice summer day with relaxing adult activities. All that comes to a screeching halt when Yumyulack and Jesse come flying in bickering about eyeliner. When the two adults are basically at their wits' end, a neighbor suggests shipping the kids off to summer camp. Seeing as how the aliens are trying to learn about Earth customs, the time-honored tradition of sleep away camp is prime comedy material for everyone.
 Along with Roiland, executive producers Mike McMahan and Josh Bycel were in the panel to answer questions. Fans have been constantly wondering what is coming in Season 2, and the producer had a couple hints ready.
 "There's interesting class stuff. In the season premiere of next year, they discover there's another group of people that are there--that they've never had to deal with class, as aliens," Bycel offered. "And we have a great episode where Terry is, like, obsessed with dinner parties, and Korvo is terrible at dinner parties and says all the wrong things, and doesn't understand by Brooklyn is cool... there's a lot of that fun stuff."
 For anyone wondering about a potential _Rick and Morty_ crossover, Roiland had some quotes that will definitely stoke those particular fires. With so many platforms emerging, and some being owned by the same entities, it seems like a matter of time, but anything is possible.
 The _Rick and Morty_ star joked, "You've gotta ask these giant, lumbering mega corporations that have merged together like water droplets, just growing into a giant ocean-sized whatever. Maybe if they just merge together into one giant thing it'll happen."

 Mcmahon was even more over the top with his comments. "As everybody knows, the first thing you do when you're creating a new show, is you start to think about all the crossovers you can do," he said. "We've already written the Transformers crossover, the Star Wars crossover, the Muppet Babies crossover, the Cap'n Crunch crossover. We have a bunch more crossovers to write in case we can ever do them."
 Are you stoked for more _Solar Opposites_? Let us know down in the comments!

 "In Season 2, The Boys are on the run from the law, hunted by the Supes, and desperately trying to regroup and fight back against Vought. In hiding, Hughie (Jack Quaid), Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso), Frenchie (Tomer Capon), and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) try to adjust to a new normal, with Butcher (Karl Urban) nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Starlight (Erin Moriarty) must navigate her place in The Seven as Homelander (Antony Starr) sets his sights on taking complete control. His power is threatened with the addition of Stormfront (Aya Cash), a social-media-savvy new Supe, who has an agenda of her own. On top of that, the Supervillain threat takes center stage and makes waves as Vought seeks to capitalize on the nation's paranoia."
  _The Boys_ will return for season 2 with new episodes on September 4. The first three episodes will debut on that date with five weekly episodes following in the subsequent weeks.

The contest points to the broader debate in the Democratic Party between the establishment and largely younger, more progressive activists, as well as the racial dynamics of a heavily Democratic Detroit-area district at a time when racial injustices are getting renewed attention. To Jones, it all boils down to one thing for a district that is among the country's poorest: who can “bring home the bacon.”

Comic-Con@Home is officially underway, and the digital event is offering fans with a slew of conversations and reveals tied to movies, TV, comics, and beyond. On Thursday, this included the hit HBO and BBC series _His Dark Materials_ , the cast and crew of which united to tease the upcoming second season. On top of that, the series debuted its first official trailer for Season 2, which you can check out above. The trailer offers the very first glimpse at the mysterious city of Cittagaze as well as footage of new season 2 cast members Andrew Scott ("John Parry"), Jade Anouka ("Ruta Skadi"), and Simone Kirby ("Dr. Mary Malone").
 In the second season of _His Dark Materials_ , Lord Asriel (James McAvoy) has opened a bridge to a new world, and, distraught over the death of her best friend, Lyra (Dafne Keen) follows Asriel into the unknown. In a strange and mysterious abandoned city she meets Will (Amir Wilson), a boy from our world who is also running from a troubled past. Lyra and Will learn their destinies are tied to reuniting Will with his father but find their path is constantly thwarted as a war begins to brew around them. Meanwhile, Mrs. Coulter (Ruth Wilson) searches for Lyra, determined to bring her home by any means necessary.
 "There was pressure, obviously, because as you said, she is such a role model to many girls and just people who've read the books in general, around the world," Keen told ComicBook.com in a recent interview. "She's a proper hero, so it was quite nerve wracking, taking on this massive role, this massive hero of literature. But, what I said to myself before I did it was, 'I'm just going to try to do my best job. Talk to Philip, talk to Jack, talk to Jane, make sure we're doing the best we can. And beyond that, I can't do much more.'"

 Season 1 of _His Dark Materials_ is currently available on HBO and HBO Max. Season 2 is set to debut sometime this fall.

According to the indictment, Jackson would use the fuel cards and associated ID numbers for bulk purchases at various gas stations, and Johnson would fill 500-gallon tanks which he had loaded onto a trailer. Johnson would sell the gas at a cut rate, dividing the proceeds with Jackson and other people, the indictment alleged.

“The family has tried to ignore these physical and constructive trespasses as best they can.... But the plaintiffs recently learned that certain paparazzi and their enablers have crossed a red line for any parent,” Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, said in their suit. “The plaintiffs will not allow the tabloids to break the law, especially when it involves intimidation, harassment and the addition of a very real security threat on top of what already exists.”
 The couple’s every move has been scrutinized since their highly public departure from British royal life as senior members of the family.
 Harry and Meghan have dropped previous plans for a foundation called Sussex Royal and instead are already working on initiatives for a new charitable venture they have named Archewell.
 They have been photographed out and about in L.A, delivering food for the needy earlier this year and working more recently to help promote the L.A. non-profit Homeboy Industries.
