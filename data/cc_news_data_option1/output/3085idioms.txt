A good Samaritan stood by until the Coast Guard arrived and was able to pull the people from the water.

The votes have been counted, and it appears Lake Havasu City has a couple of new faces for the City Council. Congratulations to Nancy Campbell and Cameron Moses for securing their seats. It will be refreshing to hear some new voices.
 Likewise, congratulations to Councilman David Lane for his reelection. It says a lot about his leadership and his listening skills that voters so overwhelmingly approved his bid for a second term.
 We should note that the crop of candidates this election cycle was pretty good. Voters had decent choices, and it couldn’t have been easy to narrow the options down. And on that note, we’d like to wish a fond farewell and offer our thanks to Councilman Gordon Groat, who didn’t appear to win a second term. Groat served the community well over the last four years, working behind the scenes on important issues including coronavirus and water supply. We know Groat will find other ways to continue serving the community, and we hope that’s true for candidates Mike Bonney and David Jaramillo as well.

We don’t expect to see much change when the new council is seated. Statements made by all candidates during the campaign indicated that they were mostly happy with the way the city was operating, so don’t expect to see much divisiveness emerge in city leadership, or for much to change. However, we do hope to see Campbell and Moses ask a lot of questions and offer new ideas and possible directions for the city to consider.
 For the incoming council members, it’s not too early to get down to business. They won’t be seated until November, so that leaves plenty of time for the newbies to get up to speed on important issues that will be coming up on the city’s agenda.
