He sleeps in the spare room, explaining to the children that his snoring keeps Mummy awake. He is ready to give up his job so that she can go back to hers. But he can't forget that she thinks he's the sort of man who can drink away the children's Christmas. And then lie about it. Clearly, there is a far deeper problem.

The Mocktail Beverages range includes a Mockapolitan, Mockarita, Mockscow Mule and Sansgria, all created by award-winning mixologist Ezra Star.
 It recently has appointed Craftwork as its UK distributor in a bid to ramp up sales of its premixed alcohol-free cocktails among British consumers.
 Three American families joined forces to create the brand after spotting a gap in the market for high-quality, premade mocktails. Star, a Venezuelan bartender who runs Drink in Boston, came up with the recipes.
 They have been designed for both on and off-trade channels. In the on-trade, the range helps bartenders speed up service, cut waste, reduce staff training time and deliver consistency. It also makes it easier for consumers to enjoy a well-made cocktail at home by buying the range in the off-trade.
 Bill Gamelli, founder and chief executive, said: "We developed a great working partnership with Ed over time as he intuitively saw the vision and understood the changing consumer needs.  We are thrilled to have Ed join us as we grow our brand in this exciting growth segment."

After several months of a downward trend in positive coronavirus tests, Coffee County’s numbers are slowly rising again, according to the Coffee County Emergency Management Agency.
 On Thursday, EMA Director James Brown said there are currently 35 positive cases county-wide, up from 16 on Tuesday, Oct. 20, and even higher than earlier in the month.
 “It’s a lot more than what we were getting around Oct. 11 and 12,” he said. “If you average it out over two weeks, we’re at about 16 cases a day. When we go back to the end of August, we were at 6.7 a day, so we’re definitely on an upward trend.”
 According to the Alabama Department of Public Health, Coffee County has seen 1,717 total positive cases since March; 223 of those came in the last 14 days, and the county remains in the red — or very high risk — on ADPH’s risk indicator.

New Delhi [India], October 22 (ANI): After Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala on Thursday also accused the Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh of cheating farmers of Punjab by passing agriculture bills in the state assembly.   "I request Punjab Chief Minister not to cheat farmers. If they've to bring a law, then they should've brought it for crops produced at large level by farmers, which sell at a lower rate than minimum support price (MSP) in the market," Chautala told reporters.   Yesterday, a war of words began between Kejriwal and Amarinder Singh, after Delhi Chief Minister responded to a tweet by CMO Punjab in which Punjab Chief Minister accused both the Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal of "double standards".   Kejriwal and Amarinder Singh took swipes at each other on Twitter over the agriculture bills passed by Punjab assembly with the Delhi CM accusing the Punjab CM of "enacting a drama" and "befooling people".   Punjab Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution rejecting three farm laws enacted by the central government as also the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill with the Chief Minister later leading a delegation to the Governor VP Singh Badnore urging him to give his assent to three bills passed by the assembly.   Punjab is the first state to reject the three farm laws which were enacted after passage of relevant bills in the monsoon session of parliament last month.   The assembly passed three bills "unanimously" to "protect MSP and check hoarding of foodgrains".   The House also passed by voice vote an amendment to CrPC for exempting farmers from the attachment of land up to 2.5 acres.   The assembly passed Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020.

One year after mass protests pushed him to resign, Saad Hariri is back as Lebanon's prime minister designate to draw together a pro-reform cabinet that can save the crisis-hit country.
 What circumstances brought him back? What do the international community and key players inside the Lebanon think? And will the consensus on him being named make his tricky task any easier?
 Why the return?
 Less than two weeks after an unprecedented street movement erupted in October 2019 against a Lebanese political class viewed as inept and corrupt, Hariri stepped down.
 He had presented a roadmap for reform to stem the country's economic downfall, but it was rejected by the angry street.
 The country has since sunk further into crisis, with poverty soaring to more than half the population, banks increasingly restricting access to savings, a novel coronavirus lockdown, and finally on August 4 a massive blast at Beirut port that killed more than 200 people and ravaged large parts of the capital.
 Protests gradually subsided in 2020, reinvigorating the derided political class, which hampered the efforts of the next premier Hassan Diab towards redressing the country, and then those of his successor Mustapha Adib in forming a new crisis cabinet after the Beirut blast.
 In early October, Hariri -- already three times premier and the head of the country's main Sunni Muslim political party -- said he was "definitely" a candidate to take on the task.
 Named on Thursday, he pledged to swiftly create a government of experts not affiliated to the country's traditional political parties, calling it Lebanon's "only and last chance".
 "Lebanon has come full circle. We're back with Hariri," a European diplomatic source commented.
 Analyst Karim Bitar said: "The revolution wasn't able to produce leaders or form a unified front, while the traditional political parties were able to consolidate their ranks, regardless of divergences over pie-sharing."
 What does the international community think?
 "The international community understands the anger of the Lebanese people over Hariri's return, but it does not share in the same indignation because they know him, are used to dealing with him," Bitar said.
 But Hariri's foreign backers France and the United States have different priorities.
 Paris wants a new pro-reform government of experts to fit the criteria proposed by France's President Emmanuel Macron under the so-called "French initiative".
 The US and its ally Saudi Arabia are however more focused on neutralising the Shiite movement Hezbollah, the only side not to have disarmed after Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
 "The Americans and Saudis are expecting Hariri to adopt a slightly more hawkish position regarding Hezbollah," Bitar said.
 The United States on Thursday targeted two Hezbollah officials with economic sanctions, its latest against the group it regards as "terrorist".
 All sides will be awaiting long-demanded reforms to unlock billions of dollars in financial aid to rescue the debt-ridden country.
 What about in Lebanon?
 Hariri's nomination was backed by a majority of 65 lawmakers.
 Hezbollah and its ally the Free Patriotic Movement led by the president's son- in-law Gebran Bassil did not name him.
 Its fellow Shiite party the Amal Movement however supported Hariri's return, implying tacit agreement from Hezbollah.
 "Hariri is the candidate of the Shiite duo and the deep state. He is an integral part of the system," said Michel Douaihy, an analyst close to the protest camp.
 "Hezbollah is comfortable with Hariri. The party needs Sunni cover in the region," he said.
 Bassil's decision not to back Hariri was more to do with a power struggle between both men, Douaihy said.
 "They're both 50 years old and want to be boss," he said, one as premier and the other eventually as president.
 But in the end they would have no other option than to sit at the same table, Douaihy predicted.
 What challenges?
 Forming a cabinet can take months in Lebanon, where ministries have traditionally been shared out between its various political and religious sides.
 In the last bid to create a cabinet, Hezbollah and Amal refused to relinquish control of the finance ministry and insisted on naming Shiite ministers, causing Adib to quit.
 Bassil, who was foreign minister in the government that stepped down last year, has claimed the next cabinet will have to be made up of both technocrats and political appointees since Hariri himself is not an independent.
 Finally, Hariri will have to endure the hostility of the protest camp, who view him as a member of the old political class, even if there was no immediate reaction in the street after his appointment.

Oct 23 (Reuters) - American Coco Gauff said she was inspired by Andy Murray after the former world number one highlighted a lack of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) board members at the Lawn Tennis Association and All England Club.
 Murray posted a screenshot on Instagram of an interview in which 1996 Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington points out that none of the 24 board members across the two organisations are from a BAME background.
 The Scot captioned the image "Tennis in 2020" and added a confused emoji, prompting 16-year-old Gauff to describe Murray as a "great ally" in the fight for more diversity.
 "Nothing's wrong with asking for more diversity. For him to say that is definitely inspiring, especially with him being a man and white," Gauff said following her defeat by Aryna Sabalenka at the Ostrava Open on Thursday.
 "For someone like him to call for diversity, it shows how great an ally he is... I love what Andy is doing on and off the court. He's one of my favourite players to watch.
 "It's important we do have diversity, because there are people from all over the world from different backgrounds and areas and I think representation is important. At least for me, as a girl... seeing yourself being represented means a lot."
 Murray has previously brought attention to the lack of diversity in sporting bodies in Britain and frequently voices his support for gender equality in tennis.
 Gauff has also earned widespread praise for her activism, having used her time during the break from the game during the COVID-19 pandemic to speak out against social and racial injustice in the United States. (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Angus MacSwan)

Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder would have “no hesitation” handing club record signing Rhian Brewster his full debut against former club Liverpool on Saturday. Brewster, who swapped Anfield for Bramall Lane earlier this month in a deal that could be worth up to £23million, made his first appearance for the Blades as a second-half substitute in the draw with Fulham.Wilder toyed with the idea of starting his big-money arrival against the Cottagers but erred on the side of caution after feeling the 20-year-old striker was not quite at the right level of fitness.Brewster might now get his chance at a place he is familiar with now Wilder is more confident he is ready.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s settled in well, he&rsquo;s an infectious character and I&rsquo;ve no hesitation (in playing him), he&rsquo;s pushing,&rdquo; said the Blades boss.&ldquo;His natural ability and talent is there to be seen by everyone, and everyone has seen that already, it&rsquo;s just the physical side of it and not opening him up to injury and damaging him early in his Sheffield United career.&ldquo;It was a difficult decision for me on Sunday whether to start him or bring him on from the bench.&ldquo;Having not played much football, you can find at times when players get caught up flitting between Under-23s and the first team that their fitness isn&rsquo;t where it needs to be.&ldquo;We want him to play and we want to get him into the team but always the big decision for the manager is the timing of that.&ldquo;But obviously he&rsquo;s had another week&rsquo;s training, which won&rsquo;t have done him any harm at all, so he has put himself right in the frame to – certainly be involved at the weekend – and to start as well. He&rsquo;s really at the forefront of our thinking.&rdquo;Sunday&rsquo;s 1-1 draw with Fulham at Bramall Lane saw the Blades get their first point of the season on the board, following four successive Premier League defeats.Despite the slow start to the campaign, Wilder sees no reason to be alarmed just yet.&ldquo;I think anybody who has watched us through this difficult period will say they have been decent performances,&rdquo; said Wilder, who led the Blades to a ninth-place finish last season on the club&rsquo;s return to the top flight.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there have been halves of games where you can say, &rdquo;Dear me, we are all over the place&rsquo;, and this is not what we are about. There&rsquo;s obviously bits to improve but the general standard has been OK.&ldquo;I actually don&rsquo;t think there is a huge difference between our first four or five performances last year to the first four or five this year.&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say the wheels have fallen off this year and we were incredibly good last year in the first four or five games, but the difference is then we took chances at crucial times and didn&rsquo;t make mistakes at crucial times.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not chalk and cheese, it&rsquo;s just fine details. So we all have to dig in and work a little bit harder and stick to our beliefs and the things that have got us here.&ldquo;We had to gain respect from our performances last year and we have to do that again.&rdquo;Max Lowe had to be withdrawn with a head injury against Fulham and the Blades are awaiting a doctor&rsquo;s report before deciding if he travels to Merseyside.Meanwhile, midfielder John Fleck will be out for up to six weeks with the back problem that saw him miss out against the Cottagers.

 The rules were simple: you must be under 16, draw straight onto the letter and ‘no digital’. The replies, using pens, pencils, paint and collage ranged from a simple scribble and calls to support the NHS with more PPE, to anti- government graffiti.
 All entrants received a certificate making them an honorary pirate of the ‘Banger Fleet’, a bootleg Blue Peter badge, and a couple of t-shirts.

New Delhi was blanketed in noxious haze Friday as air pollution levels in parts of the city soared to "severe" levels, hours after US President Donald Trump described the air in the vast nation as "filthy".
 Smoke from agricultural burning, vehicle fumes and industrial emissions -- combined with cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds that trap pollutants over the city -- turns air in the Indian capital into a toxic soup every winter.
 The air quality index at Delhi's 36 pollution monitoring sites -- which monitors tiny PM2.5 and PM10 particles that get into the bloodstream and vital organs -- was between 282 and 446, pushing levels into the "severe" category, the Central Pollution Control Board said.
 The "good" category is between 0-50, the government's environmental watchdog added.
 A "significant increase in stubble fire count" to 1,213 in Haryana and Punjab states was the highest of this season and made up 17 percent of Delhi's PM2.5 levels, the state-run System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research added Friday.
 "Further deterioration of (air quality) is expected for the two days," SAFAR said.
 This season's burning started earlier because of advanced sowing and harvesting by farmers amid fears of labour shortages during the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
 The worsening conditions came as Trump complained that action on climate change was unfair to the US.
 "Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia, look at India -- it's filthy. The air is filthy," Trump said at his presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden.
 Scientists warned this year's pollution season would make Delhi's 20 million residents more vulnerable to the coronavirus.
 "Air pollution increases the risk of noncommunicable diseases -- the same underlying conditions that make people more likely to experience severe illness or death from Covid-19," epidemiologist Sumi Mehta from global non- profit Vital Strategies told AFP.
 Healthcare systems, stretched by the pandemic, could be further stressed by more hospitalisations from pollution-related illnesses, researchers added.
 "There are serious worries that during winter when higher air pollution levels in any case worsens respiratory illness and increases hospitalisation, the vulnerability to Covid-19 may be further enhanced," Anumita Roy Chowdhury of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment told AFP.
 The chief medical officer of Gurugram city near New Delhi, Virender Yadav, told The Times of India Thursday some recovering Covid-19 patients were experiencing a reoccurence of respiratory conditions triggered by the heightened air pollution.

The interest is usually from experienced or professional investors who really understand the private rental market and the additional gains that they can get, but also the additional demands on them as a landlord when they take on an HMO.

_He restored the buckets and mops and brushes to their upright position, then he went upstairs to look in his sock drawer, where he had kept his camera._ The thieves knew what to take, though the hair dryer matters less since there are two. This latest setback, this assault on their domestic privacy, does nothing to bring Sebastian and Monica closer. After a brief discussion they agree not to tell the children about the break-in and she goes off to her class. In the days that follow he feels so low he can barely bring himself to make the insurance claim. The full-color handbook boasts of "solid protection" but the small print in the schedule is miserly and punitive. Only a fraction of the camera's value is covered, and the climbing gear not at all because he failed to itemize it.

On paper, I should prefer the convenience of digital games. Having to get up off my arse and change discs mid-session is so alien to me now, I honestly can’t remember the last time I had to do it. I love that if I fancy playing an old favourite, I don’t have to go rummaging around to locate the disc (chiefly because I’ve inevitably slipped the disc into the wrong case). No, it’s not an instant thing if I have to reinstall it, but at least I’ll always know where I can find it, filed neatly away in my PS4’s library and not kicked underneath the TV cabinet, dusty and forgotten.

“The kind of statement he issued which I listened to is capable of bringing up another genocide and millions of Igbo will die. Let us gather to reason together and run when the rain is yet to come. Nnamdi Kanu is putting all Igbo in trouble and danger in Nigeria. This is the time to call a spade a spade and tell Nnamdi Kalu that a tree cannot make a forest”.

_standing before him was a kid of sixteen or so, West Indian, holding a kitchen knife, a big one with a serrated blade. For a few seconds the two stood close, less than three feet apart, staring at each other in silence._ What troubles Sebastian is the boy's agitation, the way the knife trembles in his hands, the terror in his face. Things could easily get out of control. In a quiet shaky voice the boy asks for his wallet. Sebastian raises his hand slowly to the inside pocket of his coat. He is about to give away his children's Christmas. He knows he is stronger than the kid and he calculates that as he holds out his wallet he could strike out, hit him hard on the nose and snatch the knife off him.

May 22, 1997 - October 5, 2020 It is with a very heavy heart that we announce Cole Parker Ferguson's passing--tragically and unexpectedly at home on October 5, 2020. Cole was born at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Fontana on May 22, 1997; and lived much of his life in Rancho Cucamonga. He is a 2015 graduate of Los Osos High School in Rancho Cucamonga. He attended Santa Barbara City College in 2015-2016. He became an entrepreneur in 2017, starting and co- owning "Duct Bros" duct/dryer vent cleaning and "Spot On Cleaning Solutions" with his lifelong friend Tanner Karvala. Both businesses were very successful, and were thriving at the time of his passing. Cole is survived by his parents Casey and Jon Ferguson; sister Delaney Ferguson; grandparents Dian Hegranes and Robert "Danny" Lopez; and numerous loving and loved aunts, uncles, and cousins. He is also survived by many cherished supportive friends who will miss and love him forever. Cole was predeceased by his grandparents James and Margery Ferguson, and his uncle Nathan Lopez. Cole lit up every room he entered. He had a brilliant wit and sense of humor that were sources of joy for everyone he knew and encountered. His passing has left a hole in our hearts that can never be filled. We have faith he is resting comfortably in heaven with those departed souls who loved him so profoundly. His beloved dogs Rosie and Ted are receiving lots of surrogate love in his absence during these difficult days. A celebration of Cole's life will be held at Upland Hills Country Club (1231 E. 16th Street, Upland, CA) on October 29, 2020 at 3:30pm. Though the event will be outdoors, social distancing/masking will be necessary in recognition of these troubled times.
