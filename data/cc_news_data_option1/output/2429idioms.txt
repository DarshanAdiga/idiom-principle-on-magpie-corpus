  The former CS:GO pro compared Valorant to a MOBA in a June 21 YouTube video, and said that while both genres are "extremely difficult" to master, it's easier to play MOBAs in a "pubs" setting in contrast to FPSes.


  "It's never going to be like League, or a MOBA. There is too much coordination and too much skill required for a whole team to be on the same page ⁠-- when they're not a whole team [like in a ranked match]," he said.

"articleBody" : "Il make-up è un prezioso alleato, certo, ma occorre una base ben curata affinché dia i risultati sperati. Soprattutto oggi, l’epoca per eccellenza degli incarnati flawless, naturali, dall’effetto nude, dove è la pelle, in tutta la sua compattezza e luminosità, la vera protagonista. A sancirlo sono le ultime tendenze beauty, che hanno riportato sotto i riflettori la centralità di una skincare routine costante e completa. Curare la pelle, al fine di svelarne il suo potenziale, ha superato in corsa i tentativi di camuffare difetti e imperfezioni sotto manciate di make-up. Il tutto affidandosi a prodotti essenziali, sempre più rapidi nell’utilizzo, ed efficaci nelle loro formulazioni. A sposare questa esigenza è Uriage che ha deciso di rivoluzionare il comune gesto dell’idratazione e regalare una nuova luminosità alla pelle con un prezioso alleato, l’Essenza Illuminante all’Acqua. Al cuore della sua formulazione, l'efficace Acqua Termale del brand, che protegge e rinforza la barriera cutanea, qui potenziata con calcio, magnesio, Acido Ialuronico, Glicerina e il brevetto Uriage Aquaxyl che rinforza lo strato corneo e protegge le riserve d’acqua. Ma diffidate dalla sua texture acquosa e ultra leggera. Ispirata alla «cosmetic water» giapponese, questo prezioso booster rispetta alla perfezione l’idea del less is more, apportando, con una formula completa, ma in formato essenza, i benefici promessi, idratando la pelle due volte di più rispetto a un siero. Adatto a tutte le età e a tutti i tipi di pelle, può essere utilizzato singolarmente, oppure associato ad altri trattamenti per reintegrare le riserve d’acqua perdute nel tempo. Basta versarne 3 o 4 gocce nel palmo della mano e distribuire il prodotto sulla pelle ben detersa con una leggera pressione dal centro del viso verso l’esterno e sul collo. Un gesto semplice, ma efficace, che permette di contrastare gli effetti di stress, inquinamento e fattori esterni che alla lunga si ripercuotono tutti lì, sul nostro volto, lasciando segni di stanchezza, aspetto spento e opaco, perdita di elasticità. In pochi istanti la sua texture delicata si fonde con l’epidermide rilasciando una piacevole sensazione di freschezza e una pelle effetto seta. È tempo di riappropriarsi della propria luminosità.",

  While there's a lot of strategic depth to MOBAs, at the normal level, there's defined roles. You'll have your carries, and your supports. In Valorant, the roles each player plays aren't as defined, and unless everyone is on the same page, it makes things tough.

In a message posted on Twitter, Nadda said, "Please stop insulting of forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times.It's never too late to improve."The tweet was a reaction to a statement by Singh about the violent face-off between Indian and the Chinese troops in Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should always be mindful of the implications of his words, a reference to the controversy stocked by Modi's comments at a meeting of all political parties on Friday. The former prime minister also said the government must rise to the occasion to ensure justice for Col B Santhosh Babu and the 19 other soldiers killed in action. The BJP reacted by accusing the Congress of politicising the issue."One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrender hundred square kilometres of India's land to China.

Se la guerra dei volantini in realta e un pretesto, che il regime sta usando per provare a rilanciare da una posizione di forza le trattative interrotte?

Shooting-star German payments provider Wirecard on Monday admitted 1.9 billion euros that auditors say are missing from its accounts likely "do not exist", fueling fraud suspicions that saw its CEO resign.
 The group withdrew preliminary results for 2019 and the first quarter of this year as well as financial targets for 2025, and said: "Potential effects on the annual financial accounts of previous years cannot be excluded."
 The scandal marks a stunning fall from grace for the Bavarian start-up, set up in 1999 and once seen as a darling of the fintech scene owing to the global increase in electronic payments.
 Wirecard's revelation followed the resignation of the company's founder and chief executive Markus Braun on Friday after the firm was hit with fresh fraud allegations that have left it struggling for survival.
 Auditors Ernst & Young said on Thursday that 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) were missing from Wirecard's accounts, and Braun resigned the next day.
 "The Management Board of Wirecard assesses on the basis of further examination that there is a prevailing likelihood that the bank trust account balances in the amount of 1.9 billion EUR do not exist," the Wirecard statement said.
 "The company previously assumed that these trust accounts have been established for the benefit of the company in connection with the so called Third Party Acquiring business and has reported them as an asset in its financial accounts."
 From humble beginnings processing payments for porn and gambling sites, the firm entered Germany's prestigious DAX 30 index with great fanfare in 2018 after elbowing out traditional lender Commerzbank.
 But since then Wirecard has been dogged by a series of articles in the Financial Times alleging accounting irregularities in its Asian operations.
 On Sunday, the Philippines central bank said that none of the missing $2.1 billion had entered the Philippine financial system. The names of two of the country’s biggest banks — BDO and BPI — were used to try to mislead eventual investigators, it added.
 Both BDO and BPI have said that Wirecard was neither a client nor a business partner, the central bank said.
 They informed Ernst & Young that documents attesting to the presence of the supposed funds were "spurious", the central bank added.
 The company's four board members -- including Braun -- have been under investigation since early June by Munich prosecutors for "market manipulation", and Wirecard's headquarters were searched as part of the probe.
