As far as Liverpool are concerned, Jurgen Klopp has been dealt devastating injury news involving Sadio Mane and No.1 Alisson Becker. Mane, who's scored six in six against Villa previously, has been ruled out having tested positive for coronavirus following the midweek defeat to Arsenal. Thiago Alcantara, meanwhile, is also out following a positive Covid test. Goalkeeper Alisson has today been ruled out through injury with back-up stopper Adrian set to make his first Premier League start since early March.
 Elsewhere, Jordan Henderson will be a doubt right up until kick-off after picking up a muscle injury. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Joel Matip and Kostas Tsimikas all remain sidelined.
 Back to Villa and here we look at the potential selection dilemmas facing Smith ahead of Sunday's showdown in B6:
 "We have only conceded two goals this season, so defensively we have a really sound structure at the moment," was Smith's take on his backline this term, referencing the the two goals against in the Carabao Cup. In the Premier League Villa have been immaculate with Emi Martinez looking every bit a £16 million goalkeeper. The 28-year-old will start again on Sunday before flying out to South America having been picked for Argentina.
 Across Smith's four-man defence, Matty Cash will get the nod ahead of Ahmed Elmohamady and Frederic Guilbert once more. The £14 million summer addition has enjoyed a seamless start to life in the Premier League and has aided Villa's ability to play out from the back. At left-back, Matt Targett will come back in. In the heart of defence, Tyrone Mings and Ezri Konsa will look to make it seven games unbeaten as Villa's centre-back pairing. "They've got a really good understanding," explained Smith.

BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — President Donald Trump faces “critical” coming days after a “very concerning” period in his fight against COVID-19 at a military hospital, his chief of staff said Saturday — in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission.
 Trump remained at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday. He offered his own assessment of his status Saturday evening in a video from his hospital suite, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon.”
 And he was back on social media early Sunday morning, sharing a video of flag- waving supporters, most not wearing masks, gathered outside Walter Reed.
 “Thank you so much!” Trump tweeted at 7:18 a.m.
 The day before, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We're still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.” In an update Saturday night, Trump's chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was "not yet out of the woods.”
 The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the president’s health and the nation’s leadership on the line. Moreover, the president's health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the U.S. government but also to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise.
 Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, pulled his attack ads off the air during Trump's hospitalization, and on Sunday, he dispatched senior aides to deliver a largely friendly message.

Without a specific plan to combat Wall Street's excesses and greed, the Democrats' vision for a just and fair economic recovery -- and their outreach to working people like me in this election -- needs improvement. They can start by adopting the Stop Wall Street Looting Act (SWSLA) in their party platform, which was introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Mark Pocan last year, and would rein in the most harmful private equity tactics.
 SWSLA would accomplish this by ending Wall Street's immunity from the debts, legal liabilities, and legal violations they pile on companies after they buy them out and gut them. SWSLA would also end the federal tax benefits for private equity firms which encourage their excessive use of leveraged buyouts. And in the event of company bankruptcy, like what we experienced at Shopko, SWSLA would ensure that private equity firms like Sun Capital Partners cannot just cut and run on their paycheck, severance, and pension obligations to employees.
 It bears repeating: Democrats, be a party that actually stands up to Wall Street, and offer concrete and permanent solutions to fight back against Wall Street greed, because the strongest economic recovery -- one that provides paid family leave, affordable health care and financial security -- will be the one led by working people, not Wall Street.

Asked about race at last week’s presidential debate, one candidate gave a very disappointing answer.
 The other was President Donald Trump.
 Which is not to suggest Trump had satisfactory answers. To the contrary, asked by moderator Chris Wallace why America should trust him to heal its racial wounds, he was, as is his norm, nonsensical and miles wide of any discernible point.
 He leaned into the asinine claim that he has done more for Black Americans than any president since Lincoln. For good measure, he declined to condemn white supremacy and instead gave the Proud Boys, an ultra violent, ultra right hate group, what amounted to a shout-out: “Stand back and stand by.” Indeed, Trump turned the entire debate into the hottest of hot messes, his constant interruptions, non sequiturs and insults offering superfluous evidence that he is a vulgar cretin with impulse-control issues.
 But none of it was disappointing. To be disappointed, one must have had expectations of something better. And who can honestly say they expected this 74-year-old 3-year-old to behave like an adult? Trump is what he is. And as one is not disappointed when a hog wallows in slop, one cannot be disappointed when he behaves like an ass.
 But Joe Biden is a compassionate and honorable man whose intentions are unimpeachable. That’s why it was such a letdown to hear him address the issue of race and policing with shallow incomprehension.
 “The vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable, men and women,” he said, and of course, they are. “They risk their lives every day to take care of us,” he said, and of course they do. “But,” he added, “there are some bad apples, and when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable.”

The so-called Targeted Acoustic Startle Technology, developed by scientists from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St. Andrews, is marketed by GenusWave Ltd. based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The device was made for use at fish farms, to keep seals away from net pens.
 The device is housed in a metal canister that looks like an upscale water bottle, and produces a sound played through two underwater speakers at randomized intervals. The sound it makes is not particularly loud or unpleasant … to a person. But to a seal?
 “You wouldn’t think it’s a big deal,” said biologist Laura Bogaard, who helped with the trial of the device at the locks this summer byOceans Initiative, a Seattle-based research nonprofit. “But it’s my sense the seals spend more time further away when it is on, and when it is off, they are closer.”
 The acoustic technology replaces conventional, loud noisemakers that seals just get used to. The sound made by the startle device provokes a flight response — a fundamental mammalian reflex — without causing harm to the seal, or bothering salmon.

The Hathras episode has, once again, exposed the vulnerable state of women in India, especially those from marginalised social groups, and the challenges in ensuring their safety and obtaining justice. While the specific circumstances may have differed, the Hathras case has also been equated with the December 16, 2012, gang rape in Delhi. The 2012 case shook the nation's conscience, leading to setting up of the Justice JS Verma Committee, which recommended amend-ments to the criminal law to provide for quicker trial and enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault against women. On the positive side, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, amended the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences. But cases such as Hathras are a reminder that ensuring social, institutional and structural changes on the ground will be more difficult than making changes on paper. It is often forgotten that, along with recommending sweeping legal changes, the Verma panel underlined the need for police reforms because "the protection of women from harassment and threats of a sexual nature" is "dependent on the quality of policing…". Hathras only reinforces this, for Uttar Pradesh (UP) police officers appeared to show scant regard for the law, basic evidence-gathering procedures, socio-economic status of the victim, and also seemed unaware (deliberately or otherwise) of certain basic changes that have been introduced in the law by the Verma panel. There also seemed to be a disregard for the woman's dying declaration, which is given an important status by the law, and the state police were quick to jump to conclusions that are for the courts to judge. In fact, most UP police officers do not even seem aware of the Union health ministry protocols for the medical examination of victims of sexual assault, which says the absence of injuries does not mean the survivor has consented to sexual activity. The other aspect of the Verma panel that most states have chosen to overlook is setting up of one-stop crisis centres to provide integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence -- this will facilitate access to a range of services, including medical, legal, psychological and counselling support. The real justice for the victim in Hathras would be implementing the Verma committee recommendations in letter and spirit by both the central and state governments. This requires the utmost political commitment from the top leadership. The outrage against Hathras must be channelled towards structural reforms.

 The wave in the Caribbean is located a couple of hundred miles southeast of Jamaica, and "the associated shower and thunderstorm activity is beginning to show some signs of organization," the NHC said.
 Environmental conditions needed to support tropical development are expected to be favorable for the wave to develop into a tropical depression by Tuesday.
 According to the NHC, the system will move west-northwest at about 10-15 mph across the central and western Caribbean on Sunday through Tuesday and then move into the southern or southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday night or Wednesday.

It’s not that seals are a new or exotic predator. It’s rather that the balance of so much has shifted in Puget Sound, tipping the advantage to the seals in a highly altered environment the seals can exploit.
 Seals are the homebodies of Puget Sound. Year-round residents, they are the water body's most common marine mammal, and harbor seal populations are healthy.
 Clumsy on land, seals are superb athletes underwater. According to the nonprofit SeaDoc Society, harbor seals can dive 600 feet, and remain underwater 30 minutes at a stretch, lowering their heartbeat and taking oxygen from their blood and muscles. They can live in fresh or salt water, and seldom stray more than 5 miles from where they were born.

In a normal election, when about 5% of Georgia voters cast absentee ballots, scanning and tabulating them on Election Day isn’t a problem, said Gabriel Sterling, voting system implementation manager for the secretary of state’s office.
 But with fears about potential coronavirus exposure, nearly 1.2 million people voted absentee in the primary, about 50% of the total turnout. With such a dramatic increase, county election officials would be overwhelmed if they had to wait until Election Day to process ballots, Sterling said.
 The state election board implemented a rule before the June primary to allow county election officials to begin processing absentee ballots eight days before Election Day, as long as they aren’t actually tabulated until Nov. 3. Anticipating an even greater flood of absentee ballots this fall, the board extended that to 15 days.

"The greenway has just been a nightmare," Jackson County Sheriff Nate Sickler said.
 But it does not appear likely that the initial Almeda blaze, which started sometime before 11 a.m., originated from a campfire.
 The ignition point was well outside the greenway, in an open area by the dog park that was not a typical camping spot for people experiencing homelessness. And Kernan Turner, a retired Associated Press reporter who lives nearby, said he saw no slow burn from a campfire. The fire came up suddenly, with big flames that torched a border of blackberry bushes by his house, then swept across a grass field to reach the greenway fuel.
 "It just roared. The flames were 20 feet high," Turner said.
 The fire, fed by more berry brambles in the greenway, rapidly moved north, overtaking a person who has yet to be identified and is likely to have been homeless. "They had nowhere to go," said Chris Chambers, chief of Ashland Fire and Rescue Wildfire Division.
 As fire reached Talent, Balcom, the builder who lost his home, could hear a series of explosions as propane tanks — next to many homes — emptied and the fuel ignited. He could also make out the short, staccato sounds of ammunition stored in people's homes as it went off.
 The winds brought embers to a single-story home across the street, and upwind, from Balcom's house.

But according to a person familiar with Trump’s condition, Trump was administered oxygen at the White House on Friday morning, before he was transported to the military hospital by helicopter that evening. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity,
 Conley said that Trump's symptoms, including a mild cough, nasal congestion and fatigue, “are now resolving and improving,” and that the president had been fever-free for 24 hours. But Trump also is taking aspirin, which lowers body temperature and could mask or mitigate that symptom.
 “He’s in exceptionally good spirits,” said another doctor, Sean Dooley. He said Trump's heart, kidney and liver functions were normal and he was not having trouble breathing or walking around.
 In an evening health update, Conley said Trump had been up and moving around his medical suite without difficulty and conducting business. “While not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic,” he said.
 In the hospital video, Trump defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events during a pandemic.
 “I had no choice,” said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. "I had to be out front. … I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. … As a leader, you have to confront problems.”

“The day before is the worst day,” Buffa said. “I wish I had three days so we could spread it out and not be so stressed.”
 Democrats in Wisconsin, another closely-watched state, sued in federal court to allow for absentee ballots to be tabulated before Election Day. They argued that the law, which had not been an issue before the pandemic when absentee voting was about 6% of all ballots cast, made it difficult for clerks to address problems with the ballots.
 But the judge was unmoved, noting in a September ruling that state law already allows for errors made on the outside of absentee ballots to be corrected before Election Day. It is on the outside of the ballot that voters must have a witness signature, address and date, the source of most of the errors seen in absentee ballots.
 The judge also said that extending the deadline for counting absentee ballots by six days -- a ruling Republicans vowed to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court — sufficiently addresses the concern about not being able to count absentee ballots before Election Day.
 Andrew Hitt, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said “the earlier you start counting and the wider the time frame before you normally do it can introduce some risk into the processes and election integrity.”
 In a normal election, when about 5% of Georgia voters cast absentee ballots, scanning and tabulating them on Election Day isn’t a problem, said Gabriel Sterling, voting system implementation manager for the secretary of state’s office.
