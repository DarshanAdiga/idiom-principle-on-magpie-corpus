This doctrine was then turned into a toxic cultural poison by the immensely influential Columbia University literature professor Edward Said.

The first cliffhanger in _Trek_ history, June 1990's airing of "Best of Both Worlds" brought audiences to the edge of their couch cushions as Riker gave that iconic order to fire on Picard -- AKA Locutus of Borg --  while the former Enterprise captain was aboard the Borg cube. A fade to black and one "to be continued…" later made fans borderline obsessed with how it would all play out, with the months-long wait to the season four premiere feeling nearly unbearable. When _Next Gen_ returned in the fall with "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," first officer Riker got promoted to Captain and was given a chance to prove his mettle against Picard -- and work with his crew to save him and the galaxy.

When John Belushi, then 24, journeyed from Chicago to Toronto to scout Second City performers for _The National Lampoon Radio Hour_ , "it was love at first sight," Aykroyd, 21 at the time, recalls of their first meeting. The two went to Aykroyd's 505 Club, where he introduced Belushi -- a self-professed heavy metal lover -- to the blues. Composer Howard Shore (the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy) suggested the two comedians start a band called The Blues Brothers. Three years later, Aykroyd and Belushi debuted the act on _Saturday Night Live_ , performing vocals and harmonica and backed by Shore's _SNL_ house band and other heavy hitters. (Among them were Stax Records legends Steve "The Colonel" Cropper on lead guitar and Donald "Duck" Dunn on bass.)

I took part in a podcast hosted by Adam Boulton on his Sky TV show, _All Out Politics,_ with the editor of politics.co.uk Ian Dunt and Sky's political correspondent, Kate McCann. We discussed why the government seemed to be veering all over the place, changing its mind over one policy after another, producing confused messages over Covid-19 and with ministers making absurd gaffes. We also discussed the controversial merger of the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office, a move criticised by three former Prime Ministers, and whether Boris Johnson's vision of a new "global Britain" means anything at all.

Jim Schwartz continued the trend, as the Bills ranked second in DVOA the following season. Things fell backward for Buffalo's defense during the Rex Ryan seasons, ranking 24th and 27th during his tenure as the head of the Bills.
