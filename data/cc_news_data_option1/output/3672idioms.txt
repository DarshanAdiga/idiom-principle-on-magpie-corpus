Jim set sail for the next life on September 8, 2020 as morning gently rolled in. He entered this world on a fine spring day, March 30 of '51, in Newport Rhode Island. The oldest of four and the firstborn son, Jim was often the babysitter for his siblings Patrice, Timothy, and Sandy. The stories they can, and do, tell about those days. May those tales bring them peace. And eventually, laughter. After graduating from Fitch Senior high School, Jim headed west, all the way to the University of Utah, where he studied Civil Engineering. He did take a brief respite from schooling though, when he entered the US Coast Guard. His father, a chief in the Navy, eventually forgave him for choosing the Coast Guard over the Navy. Mostly. Jim (aka Mr. Jim by his workers in Afghanistan) worked primarily in the nuclear field, first in a construction supervisory capacity and in later years, in the decommissioning field. He traveled the world and most of the states, making friends and sharing stories along the way. He would remind those playing setback with him that he did, indeed, wear the crown of Polish Club setback champion one year, and was also infamous for running any losing scoresheets directly to the shredder. His wife Sherri, the other half of that champion team, will carry on his wild bidding ways. Jim loved his guitars, his banjo, and his mandolin. He belonged to a few Irish bands over the years, belting out some bawdy sea chanties and strumming away on his twelve string. He loved those Monday nights at the Gris, and went as often as he was able. He also loved and was so, so proud of his four sons. Sean(Cheryl Albaine), Jeff(Jillian), Seamus, and Niall are each the product of a man with a strong sense of right and a solid moral compass. And OH! Did Gramps love to talk about his grandchildren. Isla, Ava, and baby James were the littlest lights of his life. Jim loved a fine margarita (on the rocks, no salt), reading his kindle (yes, the one he ran over with his car), riding any of his Harleys, and sharing a cabernet with his brother-in-law Robert. He was also repeatedly trying, and failing, to perfect the cream center of a whoopie pie. But he made a mean pancake so we forgave him. For those wishing to donate, www.cdhi.org CDH International – A global initiative to stop Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, is the charity of Jim's choosing. His son Niall is a CDH survivor and Jim was forever grateful. In keeping with Jim's love of the ocean, he will be buried at sea. When COVID allows, there will be a celebration of his life, with sea shanties and pints and more embarrassing Jim stories. May they live on.

In an attempt to provide a space for those from the community, who need support and acceptance, Aniyam Foundation in association with Dulkal Library recently launched a queer-friendly helpline -- Sevigal (Ears). "Often, we find several mouths, othering those from the community. But we seldom find anyone willing to lend their ears -- to listen to our challenges and anxieties. What's more unfortunate is that there are no ears to even listen to the stories of our accomplishments and share the joy. The idea to launch a queer- friendly helpline was in the pipeline for a long time. It was a work in progress. However, the turn of events in the last few months, with increasing cases of isolation, abuse, and harassment of those from the community, drove us to launch it immediately. It was the need of the hour. We wanted to give our sevigal (ears) to the oppressed voices," shares Alagu Jegan, founder of Aniyam Foundation, a one-year-old NGO, working for the welfare of minorities and the marginalised.

Unfortunately, the UK has made no progress on this front, and that is despite tough rhetoric from Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss prior to her meeting her counterparts in Washington last month.

  # Little Miami football players suspended for carrying 'thin blue line,' 'thin red line' flags on field


  Charlie Goldsmith


  Cincinnati Enquirer


  View Comments


  Before Little Miami High School's football game on Friday, Sept. 11, cornerback Brady Williams and linebacker Jared Bentley took the field carrying "thin blue line" and "thin red line" flags.


  Williams and Bentley have been suspended from the Little Miami football team, according to a statement obtained by our media partners at Fox 19.


  The flags have been used in association with the Blue Lives Matter movement, a pro-police group.


  Little Miami Local Schools released the following statement to Fox 19: "Little Miami is saddened to see this story take such a negative turn. While we understand these students' desire (to) show their support of first responders, they did not obtain permission from district officials. Administrators must act when students break the rules."


  "The Patriot Night program to memorialize the victims of 9/11 was already part of our pre-game ceremonies on Friday and the American flag is the first thing through the tunnel every Friday night. Little Miami enjoys an outstanding relationship with local first police and fire agencies and a Little Miami school resource officer is also a high school football coach.


  “Little Miami always has – and always will – support our first responders, our veterans, and all who sacrifice to maintain our freedoms.”


  A Facebook event called "We stand with Brady and Jarad" is being organized for Sept. 25.


   _This story will be updated when more information becomes available._

Shaquia Jimson was 10 months old when her father took her mother's life. It was January 1980, when Kenneth Jimson killed his wife and mother of two, Grace Ann Watkins Jimson.
   
 Shaquia later was told that she and her 2-year-old half-sister were locked outside of the home in the Compact Community in Kings Mountain when their father slayed their 18-year-old mother and tried to burn down the family home.
   
 Kenneth Jimson was convicted of second-degree murder and burning other property in June 1980.
   
 "Dad went to prison and only did five and a half years," Shaquia Jimson said.
   
 From there Jimson went to live with her paternal grandmother, while her sister went to other family members.
   
 This is a trauma that has never left her, but it isn't the only trauma she has carried.
   
 Jimson, a certified Life Coach and owner of Overcoming Bondage, LLC, is using her family's generational trauma to try and help others. Her mother's story, and in her mind a generational curse of trauma and under education, is what inspired her to write, "The Life God Gives You."
   
 "I never knew why God allowed me to go through so much," she said. "He allowed me to experience a lot of hurt so I can help others."
   
 She believes the decisions of the women who came before her molded her and her sister's futures, and that of their children.
   
 Jimson spoke of the culture of introducing underage daughters to older men in hopes of her marrying. Just like she had been years before.
   
 "It wasn't called sex trafficking. Back in the day it was commonly known as whatever goes on in the house stays in the house," she said.
   
 Jimson' mother dropped out of school and had her first child at 16, just like her mother before her. Jimson and her sister followed in the footsteps of the women in her family.
   
 "I was a kid with kids. I didn't understand it. I wanted to go out and party and have a good time," Jimson said.
   
 Her paternal grandmother aimed to stop the cycle.
   
 "She told me, 'You had three children, you are going to raise three children,'" Jimson said.
   
 It was the strength and advice of Jimson's grandmother that changed the fate of her children, she said.
   
 "I fell a lot along the way. But in the end my children graduated early. I never had to go to a clinic, never had to go to court and never had to go to an abortion clinic," she said.
   
 Jimson is hopeful that sharing her family's story may change the outcome for another and break a cycle of how one's parents, grandparents and great- grandparents lived.
   
 "I want people to know, no matter what you do or what you are born into you don't have to stay that way. I thank God for the cycle that was broken," she said.
   
 Jimson's book is available on Amazon, Barnes and Noble or at her website, overcomingbondage.com. She also has a second book, "The Devil's Plot vs. God's Plan," in the works chronicling her mother's raising and what lead up to her death. It is due out by the end of September.

Prized rookie Deivi Garcia (1-1, 3.06 ERA) pitches for the Yankees, who have won five straight following a 5-16 slide. Taijuan Walker (3-2, 2.95) goes for Toronto. Both clubs are chasing Tampa Bay.

It's not fair to these fans to not see any more wrecks than that, any more torn-up cars. I mean, we still had over half the cars running at the end, and it shouldn't be that way ..._

We have achieved all this during the period of independence. Today, Azerbaijan is one of a handful of countries that carry out a completely independent policy - both external and internal. This policy enjoys the support of the Azerbaijani people. I feel it all the time, every day. This support gives me additional strength. Relying on it, we confidently lead Azerbaijan forward. Our children and youth need to lead the country along this path in the future - the path of independence, so that the Azerbaijani people never depend on anyone in the future, so that we never fall under the influence of anyone. As I said, knowledge, competence, patriotism, national spirit and dignity play the main role here," the head of state said.

But the mosque committee has vehemently denied allegations that the structure had been built on Hindu-owned land or that it encroached on the adjacent street.
 Instead, they claim the land was donated to them by four members of a family while the mosque was built in line with all relevant construction rules and regulations.
 Established in 1960 in a tin-roofed room in Paschim Talla, the Baitul Salat mosque was redeveloped into a two-storey concrete building around 1991.
 Members of a local family, Hossain Sardar, Shamsuddin Sardar, Aftabuddin Sardar, Siddik Sardar and his wife, donated the 8-decimal land for the construction of a mosque.
 The mosque initially sprawled across 6-decimal land, while the remainder was left for the construction of a street on the northern side of the property. Later, an additional 1.5-decimal plot was purchased to facilitate expansion plans. The mosque now sits on 7-decimal land, according to its authorities.

Jake Lamb got off to a great start with Oakland and looks to keep it going for the AL West leaders at Colorado. Lamb homered and doubled in his Athletics debut Monday, a 9-0 victory at Seattle that gave his new team a doubleheader split. The 29-year-old Lamb, an All-Star in 2017, was designated for assignment last week by Arizona. Oakland signed him after losing Gold Glove third baseman Matt Chapman last week to a strained right hip that's expected to require surgery. Lamb had just five hits in 43 at-bats with the Diamondbacks this season for a .116 batting average. "I just saw this was a good opportunity for me. A chance to come in and get some ABs and hopefully contribute to a winning team in a playoff mode," Lamb said. "This is a great fit for me."

There is, of course, caution in spades. Phosphine is also found in the vast, churning gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. But to explain why it would be present on a rocky planet as small as Venus if it isn't because of life, scientists say, you'd have to propose some geological process we don't yet know about.

Second place in the AL East is up for grabs when Toronto opens a critical three-game series at Yankee Stadium. Cavan Biggio and the Blue Jays are a half-game ahead of New York - the top two teams in each division qualify for the postseason this year without needing a wild card. Prized rookie Deivi García (1-1, 3.06 ERA) pitches for the Yankees, who have won five straight following a 5-16 slide. Taijuan Walker (3-2, 2.95) goes for Toronto. Both clubs are chasing Tampa Bay. New York expects to get third baseman Gio Urshela and right-hander Jonathan Loaisiga back from the injured list. Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman also could hear back on his appeal of a three-game suspension.
