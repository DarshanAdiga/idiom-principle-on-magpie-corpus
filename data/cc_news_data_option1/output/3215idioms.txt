Timothy White Timothy "Rev" E. White was born Jan. 28, 1979, in Osceola. His life was tragically taken on Aug. 6, 2020, in a motorcycle accident. He was 41 years old. Tim was employed by GA Foods, where he delivered meals to the elderly and disabled members of the community. He worked for the company for six years. He loved and was loved by every person he delivered to. Tim believed that family was the most important thing in life. He loved spending time with his children, taking them fishing at his favorite spot on the Arkansas River, riding four-wheelers, camping or just sitting around playing board games with them. He loved going to family gatherings, birthday parties, working on something with his brother or just visiting. If you ever became a friend with Tim, you didn't stay just a friend for long, you became family. In addition to his family, Tim was most proud of becoming a member of the Bandidos Motorcycle Club. He began his journey into the red and gold world in June of 2014 when he became a member of the Thunderheads Motorcycle Club. He was a Thunderhead for five years and the state secretary for the club. In September of 2019, he began prospecting for the Bandidos Motorcycle Club and became a full member on Feb. 29, 2020. Tim was a proud member of the Bandidos Motorcycle Club Cypress Creek Chapter in Arkansas. He was known for his jokes and stories, some of which were wildly inappropriate, but will be sorely missed. He loved riding his motorcycle and being with his Bandido brothers. Rev was a brother who didn't have an ounce of quit in him. His memory will be honored and cherished by his brothers worldwide. Rev may have joined the Forever Chapter, but he will always be a Backwoods Bandit forever. He is gone but not forgotten. He was preceded in death by his mother, Shirley White. He is survived by his wife, Crystal Gayle White; four children, Clayton Jordan, Summer White, Raven Yates and Savannah White; and two stepchildren, Catherine Campbell and Matthew Campbell. He leaves behind his father, Donald White; three brothers, Justin White and wife Tina, Chris White and wife Alecia and Brandon White; a sister, Ashley Callahan and husband Ray; as well as five nephews and two nieces. Rev leaves behind numerous brothers in the Bandidos Motorcycle Club, as well as the Red and Gold Nation. Memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 15 at Old Country Church, 5129 U.S. 64, Ozark, with J.D. Ellison officiating. Arrangements are under the direction of Shaffer Funeral Home. The family has requested that any flower arrangements be red, gold or a mixture of both. Serving as honorary pallbearers are Bandido Patrick 1%ER and Bandido Buck 1%ER.

“It was hit hard, but I didn’t take into account the conditions as much as I should have,” Bohm said. “The ball skipped and stayed low.”
 Thursday’s starting pitcher Jake Arrieta said it would have been a great play if Bohm had made it. Phillies manager Joe Girardi also saw it as a sure hit.
 “It’s a do-or-die play,” the manager said. “I like the fact that (Bohm) expects he should make that play. But it’s not an easy play. He’s going to make it sometimes and sometimes third basemen aren’t going to make that play.
 The other question about Bohm is experience. He has never played triple-A baseball. Since this season began, Bohm had been playing in intrasquad games at the team’s alternate training facility.
 “It was nice to get out and play a game that actually mattered,” Bohm said. “As much as you try to treat everything in those scrimmages as if it matters equally to a game, it’s just hard to do. The intensity was a lot higher (Thursday) night for sure.”
 The Phillies hope Bohm supplies a spark. The Phillies began Friday in last place in the National League East with a .357 winning percentage. Only the Pittsburgh Pirates (4-13) started Friday with a worst winning percentage in the NL at .235.
 After Friday night, the Phillies would have played 25% of their 60-game schedule.
 “I do think there’s a sense or urgency,” Girardi said. “For us, it’s ironing things out and guys understanding they have the ability to play at this level. They just have to execute. That’s been some of the tough part for us so far. I believe the guys are in a good mental frame of mind. There’s a fight down there (in the clubhouse).”

DALTON The success Dalton's offense achieved on its way to a 9-1 regular season and a playoff berth a year ago can be attributed to a variety of things.
   
 Obviously, there was a talented quarterback. There were also several skilled players as well who were credited with the yards and touchdowns.
   
 However, maybe one of the biggest - literally - reasons starts with the way the offensive line developed over the course of the season. That fact that, for the most part, that group returns virtually intact is just another reason why the Bulldogs are expecting big things this season.
   
 "I really believe offensive line and defensive backfield are probably the two hardest positions to play in the game of football, as far as what you're asking players to do," Dalton coach Broc Dial said. "I think that's really what accelerated us as far as the learning curve. We're able to do quite a few things, we're very multiple on offense."
   
 Technically, the Bulldogs will have one "new" starter at right tackle due to Austin Ryder's graduation. However, the player sliding to that spot, Liam Riggenbach, is heading into his third season playing on the line of scrimmage after splitting time at left guard a year ago with Eric Miller.
   
 Miller is back at that left guard spot, as is Quentin Lehman at left tackle and Tyler Ramseyer at center. Riggenbach and right guard Nehemiah Miller give Dalton two players on the right side of the line who are going into their third season as a key offensive line contributor.
   
 It's not just that those linemen can help set the tone for the offense. Dial, himself a former offensive lineman, believes they can do the same for the team as a whole.
   
 "You kind of go where your line goes," Dial said. "Those kids have so far done a really good job of setting the demeanor for our football team. We always coach them to be the hard-working group, and I think right now, they are doing that. It helps propel the rest of the team."
   
 What it's also done is help Dalton's offense go from heavily run-based to a much more diverse attack dating back to last season. Obviously, quarterback Adam Bidlack and a deep pool of skill players last year were a big part of that transition as well, as will be new starting quarterback Jaiden Malone this season.
   
 However, the fact that the offensive line, which only really returned Riggenbach and Nehemiah Miller as starters a year ago, developed the way it did that season allowed for the Bulldogs to open things up much more than previously. With the entire group having not just played together a year ago, but played very well, it only raises the bar even higher for what could happen with the offense.
   
 "It's night and day," Dial said. "Right now they're confident. They know the drills. They understand what we're doing as far as up front scheme-wise. They work really well together. They communicate. They work hard. They have a great effort and great attitude and are just really a great group of guys to be around and coach."

Football, Bloody hell!
 Barcelona was the venue, Bayern Munich the vanquished on that memorable night in 1999 when Alex Ferguson greeted Manchester United’s last-minute Champions League victory with that famous phrase.
 Last night in Lisbon, we found ourselves repeating those lines as Barcelona were blown away by a devastating display of pace, power, and precision from Bayern, who took barely half-an-hour to race into a 4-1 lead and by the end had become the first team to put seven goals past Barca since Valancia in 1949 and ended up with eight.
 We anticipated a modern classic, given the pedigree of these two clubs and the pathways that had drawn them together at an unfortunately premature stage, and we were not to be disappointed.
 But instead of a close-run game that showcased the talents of opposing superstars Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski, this turned into a brutal, one-sided destruction of a once-great side.
 As brilliant as Bayern were, Barcelona were truly, deeply awful. When the Germans beat Spurs 7-2 in December, with three late goals, it effectively ended the Tottenham careers of two or three players and spelled the beginning of the end for Mauricio Pochettino.
 This defeat will surely mean Quique Setien will be gone soon, and some of those senior players who had led Barcelona to such heights will depart the Nou Camp too. Messi has been openly critical of the club’s hierarchy and has contemplated his own future. Now would be as good a time as any for one of Europe’s big clubs to make a move.
 But there is no more powerful club on the planet than Bayern Munich, whose run since that win over Spurs is now 27 victories from 28 games, with one draw. And none will live as long in the memory as this one, where we we marvelled at the speed of Alphonso Davies, the guile of Serge Gnabry, a two-goal cameo from Philippe Coutinho — on loan from Barcelona, of all teams.
 But most of all it was the mastery of Thomas Muller, who took centre stage with a performance that showcased his unique talents.
 The Germany striker has now scored 199 goals for Bayern, and his first showed why he is so good.
 He got the game off to a flying start, almost literally, with just over three minutes gone. Ivan Perisic crossed from the left, Muller feinted to hit a flying volley but instead crafted a cushioned pass to Lewandowski, who returned the favour and allowed his strike partner to guide a shot into the far corner of goal.
 Setien set up his side to counter attack, with Antoine Griezeman kept back until half-time and Luis Suarez on his own up front, with Messi supporting from deep on the right. The Uruguayan was foiled by the feet of Manuel Neuer before Barcelona equalised in the seventh minute, with Bayern defender David Alaba hooking the ball into his own net as he tried to cut out a Jordi Alba cross.
 But it was soon 4-1. Perisic cut in from the left and arrowed a shot that flew off the toe of Ter Stegen and into the net. Gnabry, destroyer-in-chief of Spurs and Chelsea in earlier rounds, ran on to a clever flick and drilled a low volley into the net. And whenJoshua Kimmich crossed from the right, Muller got ahead of Clement Lenglet to flick home at the near post.
 Barcelona were shocked — we all were.
 There was a brief rally early in the second half. Messi released Alba, his cross was collected by Suarez and the ball drilled home. But it was a deceptively brief comeback, as Barcelona proceeded to give up without a fight. Davies danced down the byline and cut ball back for Kimmich to drill home the fifth goal.
 Lewandowski finally got his reward for a workmanlike display when he headed home a cross from Coutinho, on as a late substitute. And the Brazilian made it even more painful for his parent club with two goals in the final five minutes, scoring from close range each time and unable to celebrate, partly out of respect for Barcelona, and perhaps with a sense of embarrassment for his team-mates.
 Football? Bloody hell.
