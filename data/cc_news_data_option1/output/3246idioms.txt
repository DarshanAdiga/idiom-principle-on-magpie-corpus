Brisbane wasted chances to kick goals early in the match. The only aspect of the game they had to improve was the important one: goal kicking! They allowed North Melbourne to keep their confidence and belief that they could win. Brisbane weren't clinical enough. At three-quarter-time that had double the number of scoring shots than the Kangaroos, 14-7, yet the deficit was only two goals. They won the game, but only just. Bad kicking is bad football.

“The state must revise school reopening plans to protect our school communities, especially in light of new reports confirming that children can readily transmit COVID-19 and may be drivers of the pandemic,” said CEA President Jeff Leake in a statement. “Remote learning is still the safest option. Any return to the classroom requires additional precautions, including strict social distancing and access to COVID-19 testing, that are not currently included in the state plan.”


  In contrast to Gov. Ned Lamont’s and state Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona’s preferences for at least some in-person learning in all districts, the union is also asking for a change in state policy that would allow all- remote learning for all districts that have a moderate or high infection rate, or an inability to maintain six feet of social distancing or other safety considerations.

The expanded repair program is a win for right-to-repair advocates, who have long urged Apple to make it easier for third parties to fix its products. The changes should keep Apple products working longer, which is ultimately more sustainable, and it should give customers confidence that they're getting trustworthy service.
 It's probably easier to repair a Mac than an iPhone, so it seems odd that Apple didn't verify Mac repair shops first. Either way, this could be especially good news for anyone who's now using their Mac for remote work and may have an easier time getting to a third-party shop than an Apple store.

Amy Clark Meachum, a Democratic candidate for chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, is seeking a court order declaring that a Green Party opponent cannot appear on the November ballot.
   
 Meachum's emergency petition to the Supreme Court, the same body she hopes to join, argued that Charles Waterbury is prohibited from appearing on the ballot as the Green Party nominee because he voted in the March 3 Democratic primary.
   
 State law prohibits candidates for state or county office from representing one political party in the general election if they voted in another party's primary in the same election cycle.
   
 The petition by Meachum included a document from the Dallas County elections department listing Waterbury as having voted in the 2020 Democratic primary.
   
 Meachum, a state district judge in Travis County since 2011, hopes to unseat Chief Justice Nathan Hecht, a Republican who has served on the state's highest civil court since 1989.
   
 Meachum's petition, filed Friday, said she turned to the Supreme Court instead of a lower court because of the tight deadlines involved. A candidate's name can be omitted from the ballot until the 74th day before an election, which is this Friday for the Nov. 3 general election.
   
 The Supreme Court has asked Green Party officials to respond to Meachum's petition by 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.
   
 The Texas secretary of state has not yet certified Waterbury to appear on the November ballot. Waterbury is one of three Green Party candidates who did not pay a newly required filing fee and is part of a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the fee as unconstitutional, according to court records.
   
 Green Party candidates are generally believed to capture votes that would otherwise go to Democratic candidates.
   
 This is a developing story.

Demand for domestic coal is likely to be subdued in the second quarter of the current financial year, due to lower demand from end-user industries amid the COVID-19 pandemic along with high inventory at power stations, according to a report by India Ratings.The rating agency said domestic coal production remained subdued for the third consecutive month in June 2020 year-on-year as well as month-on-month due to low power demand and higher inventory at power stations.Thus, the coal offtake reduced in June 2020 year-on-year but improved month-on-month with the gradual relaxation in lockdown norms, the agency said.&quot;Despite gradual relaxation in lockdown norms, demand over the second quarter of FY21 shall be further dampened by the onset of the monsoon season. Overall, domestic coal imports are also likely to be lower in Q2 FY21 year-on-year,&quot; it said.According to IndRa, domestic coal imports are likely to have been lower in July 2020 due to the low domestic demand from end-user industries amid the COVID-19 outbreak.Also, the government has mandated Coal India to replace at least 100 million tonnes (MT) of avoidable imports with domestic coal in 2020-21, to reduce imports.&quot;The share of imports in the total domestic consumption reduced to 22 per cent in June 2020 from 28 per cent in FY20. While the non-coking coal imports reduced 34 per cent y-o-y, coking coal imports declined 41 per cent y-o-y,&quot; it said.The agency, however, said the commercial coal mining and the associated reforms announced by the government will help in shaping the coal sector towards a more deregulated and competitive scenario in the long run.&quot;However, resistance by some states over environmental concerns for some mines on offer is likely to stall the auction of such blocks. Furthermore, a global shift towards greener fuels and simultaneous withdrawal from coal-based energy may be a key challenge to participation of industry players,&quot; it added.

Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs as it is commonly called is a relatively new concept in India with only two companies raising funds via this route till now. The concept of REITs is quite common in developed countries with an investment history of multiple decades.


  Though new in India, REITs - a hybrid asset class has become the flavor of the season. The instrument has attracted investment from retail as well as institutional investors. The performance of the two REITs listed in India will lend confidence to other developers with commercial asset portfolios and investors.


  India got its first REITs in April 2019, and since then it has delivered superior returns when compared to the returns garnered by the benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex.


  In the US, all REIT Index outperformed S&P 500 by nearly 440 bps over 20 years. In Japan, the yields provided by REITs, in general, are 1 to 2 percent higher in the past 1 year without capital appreciation and the REIT Europe Index (REITE) delivered a negative return to the tune of 16 percent in the past one year.


  India has approx. 650 million sq. ft. of Grade A office space of which, 310-320 million sq. ft. is REIT-able stock. India's office stock would touch 1 billion sq. ft. in the next 6-8 years and in the next 2 years, nearly 100 million sq. ft. is expected to be listed on Indian stock exchanges as per a report. Therefore, the asset class presents itself with tremendous opportunity and growth to all classes of investors.


  Since quality commercial properties are expensive and beyond the reach of a major part of retail investors, they can invest via REITs and reap the benefits of a stable return and long-term capital appreciation on their investments. Any investment in REITs is tax-efficient and high quality as the underlying commercial real estate property is A-Grade.


  In India, until now only very few companies have raised funds via REITs. The sheer nature of the instrument makes it an attractive investment bet, as investors stand to gain from the capital appreciation of the units, and as a dividend, it is professionally managed and a highly liquid form of an asset as the units can be bought and sold freely via exchange.


  SEBI recently brought down the minimum investment into REIT from 800 units to 200 units, in a move to encourage more retail participation. Currently, the investment limit is between Rs 50,000-55,000, though it is still not at par with a normal IPO which is in the range of Rs 13,000-15,000. There is scope for the minimum investment limit to be lowered further.


  Fresh fund flows are expected in India as government announces new initiatives to attract foreign flow into the country, more and more MNCs are expected to set up businesses in India which will give a boost demand for office space in India and thereby help the performance of REITs. Most contracts signed for office space are for long-term and binding in nature which ensures smooth cash flows in the medium to long-term.


  The traction in commercial real estate space has a direct correlation with the economic activity in the country, commercial realty is expected to grow hand in hand as the Indian economy picks up. REITs have a long way to go as Indians with its love for real estate will surely find the merits of investing in high-quality commercial real estate without the hassle of maintenance, it is a great way to financially institutionalize the commercial real estate segment.

  Assuming the tests administered to that point have had an average cost of $100, the athletic department spent $136,000 on tests in roughly two months. If the athletic program had access to a test such a SalivaDirect with an average cost of $10, NC State could have completed twice as many tests for $27,200, a savings of over $100,000.

The Arlington County Democratic Committee may have come out against the state constitutional amendment on redistricting that will be on Virginia’s Nov. 3 ballot. But the three members of Arlington’s state Senate delegation say they support it nonetheless.


  The amendment to create a redistricting commission represents “a big step forward,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin (D-Alexandria-Arlington).


  “It will ensure that no one party dominates the process, effectively ending partisan gerrymandering,” Ebbin told the Sun Gazette. “The amendment also ensures transparency and brings citizens to the table.”


  State Sen. Janet Howell (D-Fairfax-Arlington) concurred.


  “I have long advocated for a constitutional amendment to reduce political pressure in the redistricting process,” she said. “No proposal will ever be perfect, but the one before the voters is a great improvement over the current system. Flaws can be remedied by enabling legislation.”


  Also on board is state Sen. Barbara Favola (D-Arlington-Fairfax-Loudoun).


  “It is time to end gerrymandering,” she said. “The amendment would enshrine in our constitution that districts be drawn in accordance with federal and state laws that address racial and ethnic fairness. These protections are worthy of placement in Virginia’s constitution so they cannot be ignored by future General Assemblies.”


  The proposed amendment calls for creation of a 16-member Virginia Redistricting Commission, featuring eight legislators and eight citizen members. Four commissioners would be from the state Senate and four from the House of Delegates. Those memberships would be split evenly between Democrats and Republicans.


  A Redistricting Commission Selection Committee, staffed by five retired Circuit Court judges, would select the citizen members from lists provided by leaders in the state Senate and House of Delegates.


  If the redistricting panel could not agree on district boundaries, the process would be handed over to the Virginia Supreme Court, which likely would rely on outside experts to draw district lines.


  For a constitutional amendment to make it on the ballot, it must be approved by both houses of the legislature twice, with an election in between.

The Lakers won two of the three regular-season meetings and all three games (249, 248 and 246 combined points) were high-scoring affairs. Portland, behind Bubble MVP Damian Lillard, has been on a roll and has won four in a row to get into the playoffs. Their offensive firepower is getting a lot of respect from oddsmakers as you wouldn’t ordinarily see the No. 1 seed as only -475 in the first round. The Lakers went 3-5 in the bubble but already had clinched the top seed two weeks ago. The Blazers are certainly potent offensively but they are facing the West’s best defense in terms of points allowed (107.6 ppg). Portland allows the most points of any team left in the playoffs and has the worst 3-point defense. Portland may have enough to get a game. If you don’t want to lay -475, although cheap for a No. 1 seed, the Lakers are currently +275 to sweep Portland and +225 to win in five, which is the most likely result.

  The EU presently sets a ‘Maximum Residue Limit’ which controls how much medicine, pesticide, and other products are used in an animal’s carcass.


  But the _Daily Mail_ reports that after the Brexit transition period the UK will set these limits behind closed doors, not in the letter of the law.


  The government has previously pledged to keep all EU MRLs, but in the future is expected to “set appropriate MRLs” which are most appropriate.

The Eastern Purple Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) though not an actual native of Minnesota, is perhaps the most common purple coneflower plant grown in home gardens in Minnesota. There is also the Narrow Leafed Purple Coneflower (Echinacea augustifolia) and the Purple Pale Coneflower (Echinacea pallida). Also included but actually a native of Tennessee is the coneflower E.tennesseensis. These varieties do differ from each other slightly. For example, the leaf on the Narrow Leaf Purple Coneflower is noticeably more narrow than the Eastern Purple Coneflower.


  I am a die hard perennial gardener. There isn’t a hosta or daylily out there that I haven’t coveted and I’ve lost count on how many different perennials of all kinds that I faithfully care for in my large perennial gardens. Quite a few years ago, I began planting first the Eastern Purple Coneflower, then branching out to the other cultivated varieties like White Swan, Cheyenne Spirit, Green Twister, Magnus and a few others. I also have the before mentioned Narrow Leaf and tennesseensis. Some of the cultivated varieties definitely took longer to establish but establish they did and now I have a booming crop of both native and cultivated varieties. And this year is an especially great year for them.


  It’s a sea of Coneflowers out there and on closer inspection, it’s also a sea of native pollinators. Bees of every sort and several kinds of butterflies flock to those coneflowers more than any other perennials in my gardens. From mid-morning until late afternoon, it’s a “hive” of activity and a joy to watch each insect fly from blossom to blossom spending just a few seconds on each one. I’m not saying that they exclude the other flowering plants but bar none, their favorite is definitely the Coneflowers.


  If you haven’t yet planted this wonderful plant in your garden or are considering adding to what you already have, keep in mind that they seed themselves and if they do well, will eventually need lots of room for new plants. As well, they can grow quite tall reaching easily to 2-4 feet tall in the case of the Eastern Purple Coneflower. They do well in full to part sun and in sandy or clay soil. Something to watch out for is deformities in the blossom like a double seed head. This is probably caused by a virus called Aster yellows which is transferred to the plant by an insect called a Leaf hopper. Sadly, if this occurs, the plant has to be dug up and disposed of in the trash as there is no cure for it.


  You can deadhead the blossoms but a better idea is to leave them and their seedheads intact to provide food for overwintering birds. Goldfinches especially enjoy coneflower seeds. This is definitely one garden perennials that gives you year round enjoyment.

"It is extraordinary that the government is proposing a ban on promotions of food and drink in retail at such a precarious economic time," FDF Chief Operating Officer Tim Rycroft said in a statement. "At the heart of this program are old and discredited policies that will raise prices, limit choice and hit two of the U.K.'s most successful industries."


  The Incorporated Society of British Advertisers called the announcement a "slap in the face" that "will cost families more at the checkout."


  The ISBA has previously estimated a TV watershed on junk food adverts could cost the economy more than a billion pounds. That's based on the government's pre-pandemic estimate that it would cost the advertising industry 171 million pounds, and ISBA's estimate that every pound spent on advertising benefits the economy to the tune of 6 pounds.


  But health campaigners said the government should have gone further.


  "It's a missed opportunity that mandatory targets for reformulation i.e. removing unnecessary calories, sugar and salt from products have been excluded," Katharine Jenner, Campaign Director at Action on Sugar and Action on Salt, said in a statement.


  The new policies will mean "businesses will be responsible and we may well see ingredients in food changing in order to make them healthier," Health Minister Helen Whately told the BBC on Monday.


  Britain has a tax on sugar to try and reduce obesity levels, and there are already restrictions on how unhealthy foods are targeted at children. Since 2007, broadcasters cannot advertise products such as confectionery during TV programs that might be watched by children. There are similar restrictions for advertising online, in print and in cinemas.

Lyon beat Manchester City on Saturday night to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the second time in their history, but they remain in a very difficult position. After finishing seventh in Ligue 1 and failing to qualify for Europe for the first time in a generation, the club’s firebrand president, Jean-Michel Aulas, was so incensed by the league’s decision to truncate the 2019-20 campaign that he took them to court, chastising them in a detailed open letter along the way. Given that other major leagues managed to complete their seasons, Aulas now stands in the right. Yet the truth is that his complaints were also a distraction for a club that will have to face the music no matter when their Champions League campaign draws to a conclusion.

Lukashenko badly overplayed his hand. He picked a fight with Russia, refused further integration and lost the fuel subsidy which dealt a blow to the economy. Then he dissed the Covid-19 crisis and didn't respond effectively. Then he held a show election assuming there would be no effective opposition, jailed his (rather weak) opponents, and claimed an overwhelming mandate. When people took to the streets to object (whether or not there were provocateurs) the police arrested and beat a large number of protesters including many that did nothing other than participate in the protest. Then these people were shown on state TV looking visible brutalized. The wife of the opposition candidate was 'helped' to flee to Lithuania. Whatever went on behind the scenes, this is what the general population could see. Then during further demonstrations a protestor died. The state said he was holding an explosive device that malfunctioned and killed him, but bystander videos show that this explanation is not true and it appears more likely he was shot buy security forces (or someone) and the protesters have a martyr. State TV commentators resign in protest and the Ambassador to Slovakia gives an interview to BBC and while generally cautious in his assessment calls the election "unfair" \- a true statement. Now the protests have spread and it appears that a good portion of the population is simply tired of the the offer from Lukashenko of "more of the same" or status quo - no acknowledgement of problems, no vision except for "I am the President". He spoke to Putin and (belatedly) agreed on security cooperation with Russia, but this does nothing to answer the discontent in the street.

The Frontenac County Economic Development department has conducted its third business survey since the onset of COVID-19. The first was in early April, the second in late May, and the third was completed on August 3rd. “Even though the surveys all received a good response, many different businesses responded to each survey. Of the 96 responses to this latest survey, 40% were new responses, so we need to treat these as independent snap shots of what businesses are thinking at different times. We can’t consider them cumulative in any real way,” said Richard Allen, Manager of economic development for Frontenac County.” The 96 responses is a higher number than the May survey but lower than the initial survey in April. One of Allen’s initial takeaways from the survey is that the pandemic has had a massive impact on their business in 2020, with over 50% of respondents rated the impact as 7 or higher on a scale of 10, with 40% saying their revenue is 50% lower in 2020 than it was in 2019. “Those are dramatic results, but we also found, however, that more businesses are saying they expect to survive this than in April or May. It seems that now that we are fully in it, people are saying that it is really bad but they expect to get through it and are hoping for a better year next year. That might change if there is a second lockdown, but that seems to be where many are at for now.” In terms of sectors, the largest percentage response was from the accommodation sector (11) This sector has been volatile through the pandemic, and while Allen said that “the phones were ringing off the hook since early June, new clients brought some challenges because while a lot of the accommodators book for a week at a time in a normal year, the requests this summer have been for shorter stays, but still things seem to have been better than people thought they would be back in early May.” One interesting thing that the survey showed, however, is that even though the major market for accommodations in Frontenac County this summer has been visitors from elsewhere in the province, many of those in the local industry are not that comfortable being exposed to people from communities that have not been as successful as KFL&A in keeping transmission of COVID-19 to a bare minimum (there have only been 14 cases in Frontenac County, none since June) 35% of the accommodators who answered the surveyed said they were neutral when asked if they were comfortable renting to visitors from across the province, 50% said they were uncomfortable, and only 15% said the were comfortable. “Most of the businesses, even though they need that clientele to fill their rooms, were nervous. On this question, neutral was not a positive response. This shows were a lot of us are at,” said Allen. That being said, the survey showed that most of the clientele, 75%, followed the COVID-19 protocols that are in place. The key takeaway from the survey, according to Allen, is that businesses are now understand what they are facing and that is easier to deal with than the uncertainty they faced in April. “Most are not doing great, but they think they can ride it out.” In terms of his department, the popular Open Farms event will be happening this year, with a record 14 farms participating. It is being planned as a virtual event in September and early October, but there may be a live component now that stage 3 is well underway. Details will be released in the coming weeks.

Getting your Mac fixed could soon be much easier. Apple says it will now verify third-party Mac repair shops, Reuters reports. The program will provide parts and training to qualifying repair stores.Apple began verifying third-party iPhone repair shops in the US last year. This summer it expanded that repair program to Europe and Canada. A total of 140 businesses with 700 locations have reportedly signed up. Apple has also partnered with Best Buy to offer certified repairs through its stores. The expanded repair program is a win for right-to-repair advocates, who have long urged Apple to make it easier for third parties to fix its products. The changes should keep Apple products working longer, which is ultimately more sustainable, and it should give customers confidence that they're getting trustworthy service.It's probably easier to repair a Mac than an iPhone, so it seems odd that Apple didn't verify Mac repair shops first. Either way, this could be especially good news for anyone who's now using their Mac for remote work and may have an easier time getting to a third-party shop than an Apple store.

With training camp now underway, it's inevitable the injury bug would come a-calling. The Dallas Cowboys are hoping to dodge the latter in all ways possible, but the first official scare is already here, and it arrived on the first day of padded practice. Gerald McCoy, one of the All-Pro defensive linemen who signed with the club in free agency, went down on Monday with what's being described as an apparent leg injury. The severity of the issue is currently unknown, but a source tells CBS Sports there will be an MRI done on McCoy's knee as early as Monday afternoon -- to determine the severity and specificity of the injury.


  The fear is McCoy has suffered a torn ACL, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, which would end his first year with the team before it actually starts. There has been no confirmation of this as of yet, and results of the pending MRI will tell the full story.


  McCoy joined the Cowboys on a three-year deal worth $18.3 million, a financial nod to how Mike McCarthy plans to utilize him in 2020, which is to say quite a bit. For his part, the six-time Pro Bowl pass rusher is looking forward to just that, noting how his final year with the Carolina Panthers left him starved for snaps.


  "I have never rotated as much as I did last year in Carolina," McCoy admitted, not long after agreeing to terms with the Cowboys in March. "That's not what I was used to. I can play all game if I have to. ... I'm an every down guy.


  "That hasn't changed, and I don't plan on it changing this year."


  It's seemingly a perfect situation for McCoy in Dallas, and for several reasons. The first being the fact he's set to be awarded major playing time as both a starter and cornerstone piece of an almost completely revamped defensive front, but he's also a huge fan of McCarthy.

Demand for domestic coal is likely to be subdued in the second quarter of the current financial year, due to lower demand from end-user industries amid the COVID-19 pandemic along with high inventory at power stations, according to a report by India Ratings.


  The rating agency said domestic coal production remained subdued for the third consecutive month in June 2020 year-on-year as well as month-on-month due to low power demand and higher inventory at power stations.


  Thus, the coal offtake reduced in June 2020 year-on-year but improved month- on-month with the gradual relaxation in lockdown norms, the agency said.


  "Despite gradual relaxation in lockdown norms, demand over the second quarter of FY21 shall be further dampened by the onset of the monsoon season. Overall, domestic coal imports are also likely to be lower in Q2 FY21 year-on-year," it said.


  According to IndRa, domestic coal imports are likely to have been lower in July 2020 due to the low domestic demand from end-user industries amid the COVID-19 outbreak.


  Also, the government has mandated Coal India to replace at least 100 million tonnes (MT) of avoidable imports with domestic coal in 2020-21, to reduce imports.


  "The share of imports in the total domestic consumption reduced to 22 per cent in June 2020 from 28 per cent in FY20. While the non-coking coal imports reduced 34 per cent y-o-y, coking coal imports declined 41 per cent y-o-y," it said.


  The agency, however, said the commercial coal mining and the associated reforms announced by the government will help in shaping the coal sector towards a more deregulated and competitive scenario in the long run.


  "However, resistance by some states over environmental concerns for some mines on offer is likely to stall the auction of such blocks. Furthermore, a global shift towards greener fuels and simultaneous withdrawal from coal-based energy may be a key challenge to participation of industry players," it added.

That being said, he has knitted together a team from seemingly spare parts – the conversion of Marçal into a left-sided centre-back is a case in point. On top of that, he has done it without Juninho’s big purchases.

 He said that the Palestinians had already slammed the decision of the UAE to normalise ties with Israel. “It must be noted that India was the first non- Arab country to recognise the Palestine authority,” he said.

 For ensuring the timely and accurate monitoring of reservoirs, nodal officers were appointed to monitor each dam under the Irrigation Department.
 With heavy rainfall along with huge inflows observed in dams under Irrigation Department, control room functioned 24X7 with necessary officials to coordinate with operations, it submitted.
 Satellite phones were provided to the nodal officers to ensure seamless connectivity. Necessary warnings were given from the reservoir offices to departments concerned regarding the opening of shutters.
 Steps for monitoring the water levels in canals and river and to clear the obstruction were also taken. Protective measures were ensured to prevent canal breaches, it submitted.
 The authority submitted that the Mullaperiyar reservoir, operated by Tamil Nadu, had a catchment area of 624sq.km and effective storage capacity of 7.666 TMC. The dam was exceptionally vulnerable because of its large catchment area and limited storage capacity, it submitted.
 Safety engineers were monitoring the dams of the board with round-the-clock vigilance. They were all provided with satellite phones in locations where mobile range was feeble and sporadic to communicate with the control rooms in case of failure of normal channel of communication. Control rooms were working round-the-clock at all major dam sites as well as at Dam Safety Organisation Headquarters at Pallom, Kottayam, it submitted.
 Till August 15, all the reservoirs of the board together had a storage of 2243.26 MCM, which was 63.50% of its total storage capacity. The Irrigation Department had 16 dams and four barrages with a gross storage capacity of 1,570 MCM. Till August 13, the storage of 16 dams was only 971.39 MCM, which was 61.8% of total capacity, it submitted.

L'hypothese des salauds est interessante parce qu'elle passe par leur intelligence. Ils ont compris que l'energie monetaire ne peut pas remplacer l'energie humaine puisqu'elle en est issue ; que si l'on fait croire au peuple que le progres c'est s'enrichir davantage en travaillant moins grace a la technique, il faut reinventer l'esclavage pour avoir l'energie humaine indispensable, meme et surtout s'il faut en plus en cacher l'existence. Ils savent que le systeme actuel ne peut durer et surtout qu'il sera tres difficile d'expliquer le retour de l'esclavage quand on se gargarise de l'avoir elimine. Ils savent donc que le systeme qu'ils ont fabrique est en instance d'explosion et que les centaines de milliers de milliards de dette ne peuvent que croitre sans jamais baisser d'un seul centime puisque collectivement nous empruntons toujours plus que ce que nous consommons tellement nous nous voulons capables de rembourser demain. Il faut donc trouver a la fois le bouc emissaire de l'explosion ineluctable pour ne pas l'etre soi-meme alors que l'on s'en sait responsable, mais il faut aussi trouver une nouvelle organisation. Et bien sur avoir le temps de mettre au point cette nouvelle organisation en restant aux manettes quelle que soit la couleur a la mode electorale. Ce n'est pas parce qu'ils ont rate l'organisation precedente qu'ils ne se sentent pas capables d'imposer la suivante. Inutile de donner des noms, tellement ils se presentent d'eux-memes a nos esprits. Le bouc emissaire est choisi, ce sera le Covid 19. Il n'est pas plus letal que beaucoup de microbes precedemment connus mais, en le boostant un peu, en comptant chaque soir a la tele le nombre de morts avec Covid et surtout pas seulement ceux par Covid, on arrivera bien a faire suffisamment peur pour justifier un confinement qui lui, detruira ineluctablement le systeme sans que les salauds qui l'ont mis en place en soient rendus responsables. Il faudra certes prevoir par securite de maintenir la panique des peuples pour que le systeme explose bien en reconfinant si necessaire, en inventant des freins multiples et varies a l'activite et en les imposant si le matraquage mediatique est insuffisant pour convaincre de l'interet de toutes ces mesures pueriles. Plus l'activite s'arretera vite, plus le Covid sera a l'evidence le seul responsable de l'explosion en laissant en place pour la suite les vrais responsables du desastre imminent. Le plan B, a mettre en place simultanement a l'effondrement du systeme actuel et qui a deja le nom evidemment anglais de « great reset » (la grande reinitialisation), est deja vante par l'ONU, le FMI et la BCE. Le detail en est prevu a Davos en janvier 2021. Il vise discretement a une diminution drastique des habitants de la Terre, reduits dans une suppression des races et des civilisations, au reve de zombies consommateurs electeurs jouisseurs dont la forme d'esclavage n'est pas encore claire dans l'esprit des salauds, mais dont la vie sera reglee par encore plus d'obligations et encore plus d'interdictions pour le bien de tous decrete par les salauds eux-memes, reunis dans leurs tetes dans un gouvernement mondial.

The concept of REITs is quite common in developed countries with an investment history of multiple decades.Though new in India, REITs - a hybrid asset class has become the flavor of the season. The instrument has attracted investment from retail as well as institutional investors. The performance of the two REITs listed in India will lend confidence to other developers with commercial asset portfolios and investors.India got its first REITs in April 2019, and since then it has delivered superior returns when compared to the returns garnered by the benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex.In the US, all REIT Index outperformed S&amp;amp;P 500 by nearly 440 bps over 20 years. In Japan, the yields provided by REITs, in general, are 1 to 2 percent higher in the past 1 year without capital appreciation and the REIT Europe Index (REITE) delivered a negative return to the tune of 16 percent in the past one year.India has approx. 650 million sq. ft. of Grade A office space of which, 310-320 million sq. ft. is REIT-able stock. India&amp;rsquo;s office stock would touch 1 billion sq. ft. in the next 6-8 years and in the next 2 years, nearly 100 million sq. ft. is expected to be listed on Indian stock exchanges as per a report. Therefore, the asset class presents itself with tremendous opportunity and growth to all classes of investors.Since quality commercial properties are expensive and beyond the reach of a major part of retail investors, they can invest via REITs and reap the benefits of a stable return and long-term capital appreciation on their investments. Any investment in REITs is tax-efficient and high quality as the underlying commercial real estate property is A-Grade.In India, until now only very few companies have raised funds via REITs. The sheer nature of the instrument makes it an attractive investment bet, as investors stand to gain from the capital appreciation of the units, and as a dividend, it is professionally managed and a highly liquid form of an asset as the units can be bought and sold freely via exchange.SEBI recently brought down the minimum investment into REIT from 800 units to 200 units, in a move to encourage more retail participation. Currently, the investment limit is between Rs 50,000-55,000, though it is still not at par with a normal IPO which is in the range of Rs 13,000-15,000. There is scope for the minimum investment limit to be lowered further.Fresh fund flows are expected in India as government announces new initiatives to attract foreign flow into the country, more and more MNCs are expected to set up businesses in India which will give a boost demand for office space in India and thereby help the performance of REITs. Most contracts signed for office space are for long-term and binding in nature which ensures smooth cash flows in the medium to long-term.The traction in commercial real estate space has a direct correlation with the economic activity in the country, commercial realty is expected to grow hand in hand as the Indian economy picks up. REITs have a long way to go as Indians with its love for real estate will surely find the merits of investing in high-quality commercial real estate without the hassle of maintenance, it is a great way to financially institutionalize the commercial real estate segment.&amp;nbsp;- By Manju Yagnik, Vice- Chairperson Nahar Group and Vice- President NAREDCO (Maharashtra).

 Shaikh Muhammad Karakunnu, secretary, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Kerala chapter, said that the UAE was forced to succumb to the interests of U.S. imperialism.
 “The decision to recognise Israel is dangerous for Palestine. More Arab countries may follow suit. However, the Palestine cause will be lost. The Palestinians who have been deprived of citizenship have become refugees in their own land, ” he said, adding that his organisation would hold discussions on the development in the coming days.
 Kerala Naduvathul Mujahideen ( KNM) president T.P. Abdulla Koya Madani felt that Palestine- Israel conflict had been an international issue for long. But now nations have started taking an individualistic stand for their own national interests. “No religious attribution can be attached to the deal. However, some undercurrents can be seen as its timing has come on the eve of the U.S. Presidential elections,” he said.
 Social critic Hameed Chendamangaloor said that Muslim organisations in the State would have to dilute their declared anti- Israeli stand.
 “Most organisations have been vociferously opposing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank since 1967. Now the Sunni majority nations appeared to be divided on the extraordinary deal. But they are opposed to Iran more than Israel. At the same time Turkey and Qatar are also supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Even the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is divided on the newly reached accord,” he said.
 Prof. Chendamangaloor also said that anti-Israeli stand of Muslim organisations in the State would not continue with their Palestine propaganda so as not to disturb their relationship with Arab nations especially Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. Many organisations secure funds from these nations for their activities,” he said, adding that radical outfits also received funds from Iran, Qatar, and Turkey as well.

A prime example of Scowcroft’s understated effectiveness was his ability to persuade President Bush to challenge the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in August 1990. At first, the president, Secretary of State James Baker, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell, and others were undecided about how to react, if react at all. After an inconclusive National Security Council (NSC) meeting, Scowcroft insisted to the president that the United States compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The Iraqi occupation, he argued, threatened Saudi Arabia and Middle East oil, contravened the United Nations Charter, and set a terrible precedent for the new, post-Cold War world. At the next NSC meeting and with the President, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and others now on board, the administration reached a firm decision. Later, Scowcroft led the way in persuading the Democratic- controlled Senate to grant Bush the authority to “use all necessary means” to induce Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait. But Scowcroft never claimed credit for quietly taking the helm after Iraq’s seizure of Kuwait. On the contrary, he repeatedly said it was his boss’s decision. Tellingly, President Bush himself credited Scowcroft for explaining why the war was necessary and for communicating that rationale.

The redistricting proposal first won approval in 2019, when Republicans controlled the Senate and House of Delegates, on a relatively bipartisan vote. In 2020, when Democrats had taken control of both houses, enough Democrats voted with Republicans to pass the measure. (Virginia governors cannot veto legislation placing constitutional amendments on the ballot, so the view of Gov. Northam on the matter was not a factor in play.)


  The Democratic Party of Virginia in recent months went on record opposing the measure, and the Arlington County Democratic Committee on Aug. 6 by a more than three-to-one margin voted to oppose it.


  In the debate on the matter, opponents of the amendment said Democrats would create a better, more independent redistricting process. But those supporting the measure warned that a position against it would give Republicans an opening to suggest Democrats had abandoned their good-government principles for the sake of political expediency – the expediency in this case being the power of Democrats to redraw the boundaries as they saw fit in 2021. Any boundaries adopted next year likely would be in place for a decade.


  While Arlington’s state senators are supportive of the constitutional amendment, it has won less praise from the four members of the House of Delegates whose districts include portions of Arlington.


  Among them, Del. Mark Levine (D-Alexandria-Arlington) has been most aggressively vocal in his opposition from the start, although others took a more nuanced approach to making up their minds.


  Del. Rip Sullivan (D-McLean-Arlington) voted against the amendment proposal during the General Assembly session, calling it perhaps the hardest vote he’d taken.


  “I became convinced that we could do better,” Sullivan told the Sun Gazette. “There were difficulties in the amendment that led me to believe it would be unwise to enshrine it in the constitution at this point in time.”


  Favola said she appreciated concerns of those who oppose the measure, but, like Howell, said those could be rectified legislatively after the amendment passed.


  “I am certainly committed to working with the opponents to pass enabling language that addresses specific concerns about how the commission operates, but for now, let’s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” she said


  The Arlington County Democratic Committee’s “sample ballot” handed to voters at the polls this fall will recommend a “no” vote. Sample-ballot positions often, but not always, sway the local electorate.


  In 2012, the Democratic committee opposed a state constitutional amendment strengthening rights of property owners against governmental use of eminent- domain powers, but Arlington voters (and those statewide) supported the measure by healthy margins.

Kingston City Council was relatively calm, resigned, dissappointed, and a tad, ok more than a tad, self righteous on Tuesday Night when, following the lead of Mayor Paterson, they agreed to turn the other cheek and abandon any attempts to reason with Frontenac County over how much City ratepayers will have to pay each year for land ambulance service and Fairmount Home. The tad self righteous part came from Mayor Paterson himself when he used the phrase “in the interest of transparency. The more than a tad part came from Deputy Mayor Jim Neill, “this is taxation without representation,” as if he was launching the Kingston Tea Party or something. The council does have a point. They pay the lions share of the municipal costs for the two services (the province pays about half the ambulance costs and more than half of Fairmount Home costs) Frontenac County pays a much smaller share, but their council sets the budget for the two services. From what Kingston City Councillors seemed to be saying on Tuesday Night, they would like to have a seat on the board of Frontenac Paramedic Services (FPS) and a seat on the board of Fairmount Home, just like the County sends a representative to the board of the Kingston Housing Corporation, and has four seats on the Public Library Board. It would be a fair ask, except for the fact that FPS and Fairmount Home are not overseen by boards. They report directly to Frontenac County Council, so that won’t work The other thing that Kingston City Council has been asking for is, essentially, at least the appearance of the ability to bargain. They feel that they asked for a 2.5% increase, and the counter offer was 10%. City staff then went and found enough money to pay 7%, a pretty good offer if the county was in a mood to bargain. In response, the county explained why they services required exactly what they were charging for them, which was not really what the city was looking for. It’s like you are buying a car and when you ask for a deal, the dealer tells you in more and more detail how much work and materials went in to making the car, and does not budge on the price at all. And it as if they were the only car dealer you could by from, and the option of not buying a car was not on the table. City Council, like the car buyer, is not interested in detailed information, they want a deal, even a small deal, to feel they are being taken seriously. When you add the inevitable urban chauvinism factor, the idea that a bunch of hicks are lording some old agreement over the Council of the Limestone City, the former capital of Canada, you can see how this does not sit well with the council. For Frontenac County Council, the two services make up over half its annual spending, employ the majority of county employees. Without them, the counties’ role would be extremely limited. They are points of pride, and attempts to rein in spending are so rare as to be the stuff of legend The budgets for the two services are explained in detail to Frontenac County Council, but almost never challenged. County staff do provide comparison costs to other jurisdictions. Frontenac Paramedic Services is in the middle of the pack, in terms of costs, in Eastern Ontario. Fairmount is on the higher end, but has a lower per patient cost than Rideaucrest, the facility that is owned by the City of Kingston. Ironically, this move by Kingston City Council gives them even less input into the funding for these services. They will no longer receive even an explanation about the costs. With his motion, Mayor Paterson has accomplished a lot, in political terms. He has extricated city staff from having to deal with this issue, he has saved the legal costs for both his and the counties’ ratepayers, and has claimed the moral high ground. Aside from the not so nice things that were said around the council table in Kingston, this is a big win for Frontenac County. They get the money and don’t have to deal with Kingston City Council on these funding matters anymore. The City and the County aren’t exactly reconciled, but this dispute is over, at least for this crop of councillors.

"There is now evidence that food diversity helps to decrease the development of allergic diseases in infants, and early peanut introduction is an important peanut allergy prevention strategy. The current guidelines on solid food introduction to infants might interfere with efforts to prevent food allergies, and may need to be reevaluated, especially in light of the variability in pediatric practice found in our study."

  # Behind the scenes at Pamplin: Dual allegiances


  By Colin Romanick, Director of Marketing and Development, Pamplin Historical Park


  For decades, the strategy, tactics and personal lives of American Civil War generals have been studied by history buffs and scholars. More recently, Confederate generals in particular have come under scrutiny for their leaving the Union and serving in the Confederacy, along with their implied or open support for slavery. These are just two examples among the many criticisms discussed today. So, it might come as a surprise to know that many former Confederates, labeled as traitors by some, returned to service with the United States military or public office after the Civil War. In fact, four of these ex-Confederate generals would go on to later serve in the United States military, during the Spanish-American War of 1898.


  Thomas L. Rosser, Matthew C. Butler, Fitzhugh Lee and Joseph Wheeler are former Confederate generals who were either appointed or commissioned as generals during the intervention in Cuba. Rosser had spent the Civil War as a Confederate brigade and then division commander in the Army of Northern Virginia. Known for his bold cavalry raids and head for tactics, he was a favorite of cavalier J. E. B. Stuart. As a West Point graduate, he was roommates with George Armstrong Custer with whom he had a friendship that even transcended the war. Rosser entered the lucrative railroad business after wars’ end and then settled down as a gentleman farmer. U. S. President William McKinley called Rosser from his tranquil farm life and appointed him a brigadier general of United States volunteers. Rosser spent his time back in military service training cavalry recruits in Georgia.


  Matthew C. Butler and Fitzhugh Lee both served as Confederate cavalry generals with the Army of Northern Virginia during the Civil War and entered public office afterwards. Butler returned to his native home of South Carolina after the war and served in the U. S. Senate before practicing law in Washington D.C. Butler was commissioned a major general of volunteers but only supervised the evacuation of Spanish forces from Cuba after the ceasefire. Fitzugh Lee’s post-war life included him serving one term as Governor of Virginia (1886-1890) and he was later the US consul –general in Cuba when diplomatic relations broke down with the destruction of the USS Maine. US President McKinley recalled Lee back to the US and commissioned him a major general of volunteers. He commanded the VII Corps but saw no actual combat in Cuba.


  Another West Pointer, Joseph Wheeler fought as a Confederate brigadier general in the Western Theater during the Civil War and had an eventful post- war life. He served eight terms in the US House of Representatives for the state of Alabama. With the outbreak of hostilities with Spain, U. S. President William McKinley appointed Wheeler a major general of volunteers with the U. S. Army V Corps. Wheeler saw action in Cuba and at the Battle of Las Guasimas shouted "Let's go, boys! We've got the damn Yankees on the run again!" in a confused moment of excitement. He survived Cuba and would be made a brigadier general in the U. S. Regular Army where he served again under General Douglas MacArthur in the Philippine –American War of 1899-1900.


  Ironically, U. S. President William McKinley had faced some of these men in battle as enemies. McKinley served as an enlisted Union Army soldier from Ohio who rose to the brevet rank of major during the Civil War. Calling on the ex- Confederates martial talents to serve a still healing nation, would seem to embody the spirit of reconciliation.

Timely mail is key to voting by mail. In states without universal mail-in voting, applications for mail ballots are generally sent out to voters by mail. They're returned, again, by mail. Then the actual ballots are sent to voters by mail, and returned, again, by mail, usually by Election Day.
 Late last month, Thomas J. Marshall, the post office's general counsel and executive vice president, sent states a letter warning that many of them have deadlines too tight to meet in this new world of slower mail.
 Pennsylvania, for example, allows voters to request a mail ballot by Oct. 27. Marshall warned that voters there should put already completed ballots in the mail by that date to ensure they arrive by Nov. 3.
 This has been a potential problem since the Obama administration, when the post office relaxed standards for when mail had to arrive. But it's particularly acute when the volume of mail ballots is expected to explode in states such as Pennsylvania, which only approved an expansion of mail voting late last year. It's also acute when the president has said openly he wants to limit votes by his rivals by keeping them from voting by mail.
 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
 It's unclear. The first question is whether there will be a coronavirus relief bill that could help fund the post office. Republicans and Democrats are far apart on the measure and Congress has gone home for a few weeks.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the chamber back into session this week to address the Postal Service.
 A vote is expected Saturday on legislation, the "Delivering for America Act," that would prohibit any changes in mail delivery or services for 2020. Congress is on summer recess and had not been expected to return until September. The Senate remains away.
 If there's no resolution of the coronavirus aid, the matter is sure to come up during negotiations in September to continue to fund the federal government. The government will shut down if Trump doesn't sign a funding bill by Sept. 30.
 States can also act to change their mail balloting deadlines. That's what Pennsylvania did this past week, with the state asking a court to move the deadline for receiving mail ballots back to three days after the Nov. 3 vote, provided the ballots were placed in the mail before polls close on Election Day.
 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and some other Democratic lawmakers are also seeking a review of DeJoy's policy changes. In response to the letter, spokeswoman Agapi Doulaveris of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General said the office is "conducting a body of work to address the concerns raised." She declined to elaborate.

FOGGIA - "Resti pure in attesa, le passiamo il presidente Conte". Pensava si trattasse di uno scherzo, poi il foggiano Francesco Ferrazzano ha riconosciuto la voce del premier, suo conterraneo. "Non ci posso ancora credere", racconta Francesco che, insieme alla moglie Grazia, sta ospitando una coppia di sposi in luna di miele nel Gargano, Zdeneck e Camilla, a cui il 6 agosto sconosciuti hanno rubato soldi e documenti. I due stranieri, originari della Repubblica Ceca, stavano scattando alcune fotografie al tramonto a Torre Mileto, stazione balneare di San Nicandro Garganico (Foggia), quando si sono accorti che dalla loro auto erano stati rubati un borsone contenente 1900 euro e gli effetti personali. I documenti sono stati ritrovati e restituiti alla coppia di sposini. Zdeneck e Camilla ripartiranno giovedi, 20 agosto. "Con il presidente Conte siamo stati al telefono oltre 30 minuti, mi ha messo da subito a mio agio. Mi ha ringraziato per aver dato, con il mio gesto, lustro alla nostra terra", racconta Francesco Ferrazzano rivelando che il premier Conte ha devoluto, di tasca propria, anche 500 euro per aiutare la giovane coppia a tornare a casa . Con gli sposini il premier ha anche parlato al telefono per pochi minuti. Infine Conte si e fatto promettere da Francesco che portera Zdeneck e Camilla a San Giovanni Rotondo a pregare sulla tomba di San Pio. "Andremo domani, e una promessa", assicura Francesco.

McClaren believes he is not the answer, with more money needing to be spent on a proven performer to fill an important role.
 He admits that Haaland, who ended up joining Borussia Dortmund in January, would have been ideal for the Red Devils, and it is difficult to see where they are going to find a suitable alternative in the current transfer window – with Jadon Sancho not the right fit either in an already well-stocked attack.
 Sir Alex Ferguson’s former assistant at Old Trafford told _talkSPORT:_ “The front four are so quick, they’re so exciting and they cause so many problems, and Martial is a fantastic player, but in the big games when it really matters he never looks like a true goalscorer. They need class in that position.
 “I don’t think [Romelu] Lukaku fit into what Man United are all about, that high intensity, and I think they need that.
 “The manager is helpless if the club don’t back him and go for the likes of Haaland. What a perfect fit he would have been. I’ve seen him for Dortmund and he’s an incredible player at 20. Imagine him in the Man United team, that would be spot on. So they’re not far away, but they have to spend the money and get the right players.
 “I’ve seen Jadon Sancho play a lot for Dortmund and he’s very, very exciting, but he’s a little bit like Martial, [Marcus] Rashford and [Mason] Greenwood and I wonder, do they really need that?
 “He’s not a No 9, and Martial, Rashford and Greenwood aren’t that either. You’ve got to get a fox in the box, a goalscorer and No 9 and they’ve got to find one quick.

Here, the adult world is an even more uncertain and threatening place, with a volatile Dennis Hopper playing her violent father, an ex-convict, who trails havoc. Like Malick, Hopper sensed Manz’s instinctive acting ability, rewriting the script to make Cebe the central character – an outsider with a nihilistic punk attitude.

Establishing a lasting foundation for data transfers in transatlantic commerce means addressing the core fundamental rights concerns expressed by the CJEU.

Redress entails, at a minimum, constructing a system of administrative fact-finding and judicial review to respond to individual complaints. Fortunately, there’s no need to start from scratch. As we propose here, existing institutional mechanisms within U.S. surveillance law can be adapted to this task, albeit with certain modest statutory adjustments.

He was preceded in death by his wife, Margaret, parents, Fred and Marion (Suprise), his sister Marilyn (Titkemeier), and two brothers, Howard and Donald. Daryl was born on July 18, 1932 in Gibsonburg, Ohio and graduated from high school there in 1950. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Education from Ohio State University in 1955, served in the U.S. Army in post-war Korea, and earned a master's degree in General Science from Michigan State University in 1963. While studying at Michigan State, Daryl met his future wife, Margaret Yates, who was studying for her master's of Food Science degree. They were married in 1963. Daryl and Margaret welcomed two children into their family, Heather and Torey. His children remember him as father who encouraged them to pursue their goals, a man of strong work ethic, and fondly recall his love of exotic foods and cooking meals from scratch as well as his relentless pursuit of knowledge. He was a self-taught handyman and excelled at home improvement and repair projects. He loved reading and had books on every topic, and was most passionate about gardening. He was an active and dedicated member of the Lutheran Church, especially enjoying singing hymns. Daryl worked as a mathematics and science teacher for over 30 years in Gibsonburg, Orange, and Shaker Heights, Ohio. He took a year's sabbatical when the family followed Margaret to Melbourne, Australia for work. On the way to Australia, the family visited Tahiti and Bora Bora, and Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Egypt, Greece, and the United Kingdom on the return trip. He and Margaret also toured Japan, France, Russia, and Ireland. After retiring from teaching, Daryl worked a number of jobs including as truck driver for Nestle and interior plantscape technician. On top of his work, Daryl performed much of the household work in support of the family as Margaret pursued her long career in food science and quality assurance at Nestle. After Margaret passed away in 1998, Daryl retired, living first in Pasadena creating an active life for himself knitting and cooking with friends at the Pasadena Senior Center, continuing his passion for the Chinese culture by teaching English as a volunteer at the Chinatown library, and volunteering his time with the Friends Outside. Later, he moved to Santa Cruz to be closer to his daughter and watch his grandchildren grow up. A memorial will be scheduled at a future time.

“The irony is very thick and definitely not lost on me,” Carranza told CNN. “Trump has been saying mail-in ballots will bring fraud to the election but absentee ballots are legit. Which is it? It can’t be both ways. I laughed because if the campaign actually took information from other times they have reached out to me, they’d know I won’t vote for Trump despite being a registered Republican.”
 The Trump campaign said the mailer shows how it "is working to ensure voters in every state know how their state's sorting system works so that every eligible voter can cast their ballot and have their vote counted," Thea McDonald, deputy national press secretary, told CNN over email after she was shown the mailer.
 "President Trump has consistently and rightly said that where a voter cannot make it to the polls, they should request an absentee ballot," McDonald said. "The President has also correctly distinguished between chaos-ridden universal mail-in voting systems, like the one that led to California's train wreck primary, and traditional absentee mail voting systems, like the tried and true system in North Carolina—a distinction Democrats and many in the mainstream media purposely ignore to sow confusion."
 The mailer was sent out by the North Carolina Republican Party, press secretary Tim Wigginton told CNN. The state party has sent several statewide mailers "to make it easier for interested voters to participate," Wigginton said.
 "We want our voters to know they can utilize this tool to cast their ballot in an easy, safe and secure manner. It is important to note that the North Carolina system requires a voter to actively solicit a ballot and go through an easy but important verification process to request a ballot," he added. "We along with President Trump oppose an all-mail election process where voters are mailed ballots without a prior request and authentication."
 The USPS has come under criticism recently. Newly released letters from the USPS have warned nearly every state that slowdowns in delivery could cause ballots to show up late and not be counted. CNN and other news organizations also reported that in the last week that USPS has removed letter collection boxes in at least four states: New York, Oregon, Montana and Indiana.
 The USPS announced Sunday it would stop removing postal collection boxes through late November following complaints about how some had been taken away.
 House Democrats said Sunday they are "ramping up" their investigation of the United States Postal Service and as Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, called on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors Robert Duncan to testify.
 Possible action by the House could include forbidding the Postal Service to change sorting devices, prevent the closure of facilities, stopping any effort to end overtime pay or changing the timing of mail delivery, one of the sources said. Democrats also may push language requiring all ballot deliveries to have first class status.
 While it is common for candidates and political parties to send mail to voters, especially those who don't have access to TV or the internet, Real Facts NC, a non-profit dedicated to researching and telling the stories about issues facing North Carolinians, has never seen a mailer like this before, messaging director Jazmynne Williams told CNN.
 One voter concerned over the problems facing the USPS is Taylor Alexander, of Wake County, North Carolina. She received the absentee ballot request form on Wednesday.
 “My initial reaction was that I was kind of shocked, and laughed because of the irony of it, because Trump had been railing against mail-in voting, but here his party was, promoting it, and sending out an absentee ballot request form,” Alexander said. “I think it’s ridiculous that the funding is being cut and processes are being changed in the post office. People’s life saving medication are days late, bills aren’t being paid on time, and all for what? It’s rigging the election.”

La chiusura delle discoteche "penso che sia un provvedimento coraggioso e coerente, che mette fine alla babele di voci e di provvedimenti e che sicuramente dà un segnale ai giovani. Penso abbia anche un impatto sulle trasmissioni perché le discoteche sono un luogo in cui sicuramente è favorita la diffusione del virus, perché si entra involontariamente in contatto con persone che non si conoscono, aumenta la respirazione e chiaramente sono condizioni in cui si facilita l’infezione”. È questa la posizione di Andrea Crisanti, ordinario di microbiologia all'Università di Padova, che in un intervento a Timeline, su Sky TG24, ha affrontato alcuni dei temi più caldi legati alla pandemia di Covid-19.

Between 1800 and 1830, states built better roads and canals. Travel times were shortened, and the cost of travel shrunk. The Post Office, established in 1792, delivered printed material cheaply, subsidizing a booming national press. Americans were able to gather across vast distances, had better information and depended less on word of mouth from political leaders.

The first days of training camp can teach you a lot about an NFL team.

And that drain has prompted its young people to go West in search of greener pastures.
