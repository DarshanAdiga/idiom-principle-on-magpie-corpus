From installing some of the basic principles of the offense to simply fighting to earn a spot on the field, this is valuable missed time for a lot of players on the team, hence why Longo is so concerned.
 “It’s the 25 newcomers and the three or four guys that didn’t play much last year that may have a bigger role this year, they’re the ones that are being cheated by this whole process,” Longo said. “Those are the ones I spend the most time communicating with and, as a staff, we spend the most time talking about in an effort to have the best strategy to address preparing them for August.”
 One example Longo gave of how valuable missed spring ball can be is with his starting quarterback Sam Howell. The Indian Trail, NC, native was an early enrollee in the 2019 class and went on to have an All-American true freshman season for UNC.
 Had Howell not gotten those valuable reps during last year’s spring practice, things almost certainly would have not panned out how they did for the ACC Offensive and overall Rookie of the Year.
 “There’s a couple of players every year that come in and they have a great spring and, because of those reps, they prepare themselves to be able to play in the fall,” Longo said. “Sam Howell’s a perfect example. I can’t imagine where we would have been in the South Carolina game had he never had spring ball last year.”
 Another concern for Longo are the practice reps his offense is losing. Of course, the players can stay in shape and work on their craft from home, but nothing can replace going up against real players in a real practice.

Trump requested an additional $250 billion for a just-launched small businesses payroll program and is looking to secure congressional passage this week. For that he will need Democratic support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer outlined their own priorities in a Wednesday statement. They say they will approve the $250 billion in assistance to small businesses, but want $125 billion of that channeled through community-based financial institutions that serve farmers, families, women, minorities and veterans. They're also calling for an additional $100 billion for hospitals and community health centers to provide testing supplies and protective equipment like masks and gowns.

Nearly all Wisconsin’s counties have cases of COVID-19, but so far, the greatest impact has been in urban areas.
 Southeast Wisconsin not only has the greatest number of people testing positive for the new coronavirus, it has the highest number of deaths. As of Tuesday afternoon, the state had 92 total fatalities from the respiratory disease, with Milwaukee County reporting 49 of those.
 The state's rural counties haven't had nearly as many cases. That's due in part to limited testing statewide for the virus.
 "We do know that rural areas will not be spared," said Susan Turney, CEO of Marshfield Clinic Health System, during a Wisconsin Health News video chat Tuesday. "And as we increase the number of patients and our capacity gets tested in our facilities, we're hoping that we have the capability at that time to do (more widespread) testing."
 Marshfield Clinic is part of a partnership between private companies and public labs designed to increase COVID-19 testing in the state. Testing was initially limited to the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene and the Milwaukee Public Health Lab. Now, Exact Sciences, Marshfield Clinic, Promega and UW Health have come on board.
 The two public labs have been analyzing between 1,500 to 2,000 COVID-19 tests per day. The expanded capacity from the state’s new public-private partnership is expected to double that capacity initially and continue to expand as additional platforms and supplies become available, according to a press release from Gov. Tony Evers' office.
 Differences in rural and urban health care are nothing new, but the pandemic is stretching already thin margins for hospitals in sparsely populated areas.

 "Rural health care was in crisis before this pandemic occurred," said Turney.
 Across the United States, 128 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.
 Rural hospitals in the U.S. aren't only bringing in less money because scared patients are making fewer doctor visits, but hospitals are also paying more for personal protective equipment like masks and other gear in short supply, reported NPR.
 Turney said half the rural hospitals across the country were having financial difficulties before the pandemic. And now, they're losing money from elective surgeries that were postponed for safety reasons and to free up space for a possible surge of COVID-19 patients.
 Non-essential surgeries have been postponed at hospitals across Wisconsin. On Tuesday, Madison’s three hospitals announced that the postponement of elective procedures would continue through April 24 — the length of the Evers administration's safer-at-home order.
 SSM Health, UW Health and UnityPoint Health – Meriter said in a release that "the decision was not taken lightly but remains necessary" to preserve beds for coronavirus patients and reduce COVID-19 infections.

 The move was a first step by Germany, officials said, as worries mount about the health situation in the Greek camps due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Tens of thousands of migrants tried to get into European Union member Greece after Turkey said in February it would no longer prevent them from doing so, as agreed in a 2016 deal with the EU in return for aid for Syrian refugees.
 Greece has described conditions in the camps on some of its islands, where more than 40,000 asylum seekers are now stuck during the coronavirus crisis, as a "ticking health bomb."
 Germany's interior ministry said it aimed to begin the transfer of unaccompanied minors, aged under 14, next week from Greece, which has been the main gateway into the EU for people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond.
 On arrival in Germany, the young people will be placed in quarantine for two weeks before they are divided up across Germany, the ministry said, adding that it was part of an agreement among some 10 EU states.
 A spokesman for the interior ministry said he expected other countries to take in their contingents soon but that the outbreak of the coronavirus had understandably led to delays.
 "We don't want to wait any longer for the others and are starting now," Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told n-tv television, adding that in the long run, Germany would take in 350 to 500 unaccompanied minors.
 While the rush to the border in March met a strong response from Greek security forces, tensions have largely settled since the outbreak of the new coronavirus prompted Turkey to close its borders with Greece and Bulgaria.
 Greece is urging the EU to help during the coronavirus crisis and has said it is ready to protect its islands, where no cases have so far been recorded.

Although I admit that this is totally speculative, it’s my belief that we will likely re-test the recent lows that we’ve made. When the market rallied more than 20% off of the lows, I stopped thinking about buying. Simply put, I just couldn’t bring myself to buy stocks into such a strong rally like that.
 I have put together an extensive watch list with price targets that I missed a couple of weeks when the market was at its lows. In hindsight, there were many prices that I regretted not buying. But, now that I’ve used these lows to update the price targets on my watch list, I will be ready the second time around (assuming I am correct about us potentially re-testing the lows).
 I think it’s likely that the COVID-19 data is going to be worse before it gets better. The same can be said of economic data as well. I want to make sure that I have ample cash on hand as we head into Q1 and Q2 earnings season. I suspect we’ll see some pretty ugly reports and I want to be able to take advantage of any weakness that they inspire.
 However, if I’m wrong about the direction the market will head in the short to medium term, that’s okay too. Being that I’m ~93% invested in equities right now, if I’m wrong and we’ve already seen a bottom, it’s not the end of the world. If the market rallies back towards the highs, I’ll surely regret that I didn’t take better advantage of this sell-off. But, in this situation, I’ll also be making a ton of money, so at the end of the day, regretting inaction is a fairly decent problem to have with regard to my current asset allocation.
 So, with all of that being said, let’s get into the trades that I’ve made during March. I made 26 trades in total. This is a stupendous amount for me (most months, I made a handful of selective re-investment trades at the beginning of the month and then maybe 2-3 trades throughout the rest of the period; some months, I don’t make any trades at all). But, I’ve always maintained the mindset to take what the market gives me in terms of attractive value and right now, during March, there were certainly plenty of bargains floating around.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Since a tiger in New York was diagnosed with the coronavirus, veterinarians and animal care workers have been encouraging people not to take their pets to animal shelters.Experts say you may be more of a danger to your pet than they are to you.The last updated number of diagnosed companion animals in the world with coronavirus, not including a tiger in New York, is four.Dr. Bob Watson of Brookhaven Animal Hospital says two dogs and two cats worldwide is the last count.“Bear in mind that of 1.4 million cases of CoViD-19 in people, that’s such a very, very, very, small, almost nonexistent number, but yes, that’s currently the data I have,” Watson said.The risk actually lies in you, Watson said.While it’s a very, very small chance your pet could get CoViD-19, if there’s social distancing to be had, it’s you from them.“Currently that hasn’t happened in the United States, but it’s possible, so what we expect is for you, if at all possible, to socially distance yourself from your animal if you’re positive,” Watson said.There are strains of coronavirus that can affect dogs and cats, Watson said. A quick internet search will turn that up.“Cats and dogs get their own coronaviruses,” Watson said. “So when people Google cat and dog coronavirus, they may find something. But it’s not CoViD-19.”At Brookhaven Animal Rescue League, the shelter is shut down against the coronavirus so volunteers can shelter in place as much as possible.BARL President Rusty Adcock said now more than ever, people should have their animals with them.“That’s what the companion animals are there for is to kinda take that anxiety away, so you’ve got to cling to them. There’s no scientific reason not to,” said Adcock.“At this point in time there is currently no recognized risk of having a pet and your pet transmitting this virus to you,” said Watson.So curl up on the couch with Fido.

The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has engulfed the world within a span of a few weeks, sending billions into lockdown. Amid the confusion and scare, "patient zero" has been traced back to a wildlife market in Wuhan, China. Preliminary studies indicate that the coronavirus from bats infected humans, through a wild animal, Malayan pangolins. The genomic resemblance between the Pangolin coronavirus and Sars-CoV-2 (Covid-19 virus) is what has brought about this assumption.Bats, pangolins and humans are not cohabitants, which acts as a "species barrier", preventing the virus naturally found in bats from jumping to other species. But environmental crimes like wildlife poaching and consumption result in the breaking of the species barrier. The presence of Malayan pangolins (natural inhabitants of Southeast Asia's forests) in the Chinese meat market strongly points towards illicit wildlife trade and trafficking. Malayan pangolins are hunted for their skin, scales, meat and for ingredients in oriental medicine. All species of pangolins are included in Cites Appendix I, which means their international trade is prohibited.As per the World Customs Organization's Illicit Trade Report, in 2018, customs administrations from 47 countries reported 2,727 seizures of flora and fauna - which amounts to 59,150 pieces and 3,60,495 kg of various flora and fauna. Being rich in biodiversity, the Indian subcontinent, Africa and South America are most vulnerable for wildlife crimes and trafficking. In most of the cases, the destination remains China. Wildlife animals and products such as rhino horns, ivory, live pangolins and their scales, turtles and tortoises, snakes and their skin, mongoose, sea horses, sea cucumber, crocodile skin and porcupines are trafficked in substantial quantities.Several Wuhan-type wet and dry markets are operational in China, Thailand and Vietnam that have a demand for exotic wildlife articles. In China alone, domestic wildlife farming is assessed as a billion-dollar industry. The rich and the privileged are the prime consumers of wildlife products, primarily because of the superstitions surrounding traditional Chinese medicine and false pride associated with the ownership of certain wildlife articles. Rhino horn, pangolin scales and tiger bones are used in traditional medicines, aphrodisiac recipes and in body-building tonics. Scientific studies completely condemn and disprove these beliefs. On the contrary, the Chinese wildlife market has seen an alarming rise in demand for rhino horn extract, due to a false belief that it can help treat Covid-19. Wildlife farming and consumption of wild meat in China have historical reasons such as famine and poverty. Gradually, it evolved into a tradition.Wet markets sell live meat, fish and marine products. Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Burmese wet markets are notorious for selling game meat and other numerous wildlife items. They keep live animals in cages, stacked one above the other. If the topmost cage has bats and those below it have turtles, civets, ducks, porcupine and pangolins, it can lead to the mixing of their excreta and fluids. It makes the entire stock a natural mixing bowl, helping the virus cross the species barrier. Such congested and stressful circumstance reduces immunity and results in the multiplication of the virus, and infection and transmission of the disease.When humans slaughter or dress the affected animals, they contract the virus. Inside the human body, the virus undergoes mutation, which can result in the pandemic of the current magnitude. The emergence of Covid-19 and the role of the Wuhan market is still under investigation. However, the 2003 outbreak of the Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic was ultimately traced back to masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), traded in China's Shenzhen wet market.In 2010, Indian customs had prevented an attempt to import over 10,000 red-eared turtles from China. Later, it was found that, according to International Union for Conservation of Nature's classification, the seized turtles were considered as one of the most invasive species on the earth. Its potential to outnumber the native turtle population and the microbial cargo it would have brought along give an idea about the severity of the crime.A crazy pet culture poses yet another threat to the environment and global health. Many consider reptiles, turtles, wild lizards and other exotic species as new age pets. Close contact with such pets offers an opportunity for a virus like Covid-19 to cross species barriers and infect humans. Unless strictly prohibited, the illicit trade of wildlife and the new age pet culture have the potential to turn into another pandemic bomb.Anees Cherkunnath is an IRS officer posted with Indian Customs.
