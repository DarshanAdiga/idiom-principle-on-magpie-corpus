"But she is completely out of kilter with everything else we have found.
 "It was totally unexpected to find someone like that.
 "The big question that arises is why has she been dumped in a large pit or ditch, on her own, in an area completely unrelated to the 14th-century graveyard.
 “It is only speculation at the moment, but we could be looking at someone who has been murdered.”
 Lawson said carbon dating and forensic and isotopic analysis would be carried out over the next year to solve the mystery.
 He said: “We are going to throw all the science we can at her to try to understand who she is, where she comes from and why she was in there.

 If Natasha had been luckier, she might have been able to make her family richer. The fact her life has been different to Sunak's is not her fault, but then she hasn't sought responsibility for running the country.
 Sunak did. He, and those who recruited, promoted, and voted for him, thought his background as a millionaire married to daughter of a billionaire showed he knew how to make money.
 But all it shows is that he doesn't notice how outrageously overpriced his coffee mug is. So how could he see overpriced PPE, or the point of paying every adult £1,000 a month during a pandemic to prevent economic disaster, or that "unviable" people are precisely the sort many of us can't do without?

 "I think he is really growing into the role. He wants to improve as a player on a daily basis, which is the most important thing, but he is also aware that he wants to grow as a leader as well.
 "I couldn't be any more pleased for James in terms of his consistency and his goals and assists are always a bonus on top of the performances.
 "He is certainly leading by example on and off the pitch.
 "In terms of the award as a staff, it should really be called the management team award because everyone puts so much in, not just the management staff in terms of the coaches.
 "Behind the scenes there are a lot of staff that push the team and do everything they can to take the excuses away from the team.

HOLLAND -- During what would typically be a busy holiday season, restaurants across the state have been ordered to shut their doors to in-person dining. In an effort to support them, Holland residents Nicole and Eric Dykstra are putting their money where their mouths are.
   
 Following the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announcement that restaurants statewide must keep their doors closed until at least Tuesday, Dec. 8, the couple decided to forego traditional Christmas presents -- instead putting that money toward supporting local restaurants with carryout orders.
   
 "We feel extremely fortunate during this difficult time because we both have stable employment," Nicole said.
   
 "We thought this would be a fun way to have date nights, get out of the house and create a sense of adventure while supporting these restaurants."
   
 In the two weeks since the order went into effect, Nicole and Eric have visited five restaurants.
   
 "We might have to loosen our pants by the end of this," Nicole said. "But we're willing to do that for our local businesses."
   
 The couple moved to Holland last spring as they began the foster-to-adopt process.
   
 "My husband is from here," Nicole said. "But I'm not. And I immediately noticed the deep sense of community that Holland has.
   
 "People here just wrap their arms around small businesses and they support each other. I'm just so grateful for our thriving downtown and we want to do everything we can to support that right now."
   
 Nicole and Eric have a few favorite restaurants, including Eighth Street's Windmill Restaurant for breakfast. They also have a favorite server at Russ' Restaurant on Eighth Street.
   
 "There's so many good spots, it's hard to decide," Nicole said. "And that's a good problem to have."
   
 For the couple, restaurants have often provided a venue for celebration.
   
 "Our foster-to-adopt process has taken longer because of COVID," Nicole said. "So, every step of the way, we've gone to a local restaurant to celebrate. It's special to our family."
   
 More than anything, Nicole and Eric want other families in the area to consider following in their footsteps.
   
 "If we could just get one or two other families to cut back on actual gifts and do this instead, I would consider it a success," Nicole said. "And there are other ways to support local restaurants, too. You can buy gift cards or purchase merchandise. It's just really important to keep our holiday dollars local this year."
