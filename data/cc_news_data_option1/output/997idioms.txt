She posted on instagram: A decade. Almost a decade to us. To you. We saw too much together. Shared too much. Lives. Deaths. Happiness. Desparity. Been there through thick and thin. And here you are. Off to unfold a new chapter of your life. I can't believe you are getting married now. My young firefly turned into such a fine lady and in no time chose her path so gracefully; I had never thought would happen so early. Although I always knew you were to always fly higher and higher. I wish you nothing but the best. It will be hard to share you. But tell your husband to be that you will always be mine first.@sajalaly."

President Trump and other sane patriots from both parties of America would then have to figure out how to start the long but vital process of forcing credit to regenerate the destroyed productive base of America and Europe with a focus on advanced infrastructure, science and technological progress. This later investment into space science, atomic power, and transportation (high speed and magnetic levitation) would drive new breakthroughs necessary to overcome the current “limits to growth” that Green New Dealing oligarchs believe justify reducing the world population to less than two billion. Where Franklin Roosevelt had to drive this process solo in the 1930s, today’s America luckily has a China-Russia alliance that have created a powerful “New Deal” of win-win cooperation in the form of the evolving _Belt and Road Initiative_ with invitations for western nations to jump on board.

Australias High Court on Thursday delayed judgment in Cardinal George Pells appeal against child sex abuse convictions, with a decision now not expected for months. The court adjourned after two days of dense legal argument over the case of the 78-year-old former Vatican treasurer, who is trying to overturn a six-year sentence for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys in the 1990s.Pell, who once helped elect popes, is the highest- ranking Catholic Church official ever convicted of child sex crimes. He was not present for the two-day hearing and will remain behind bars while seven of Australias top judges consider his fate.A court official told AFP it typically took between three to six months for a decision in cases where judgment had been reserved. Pells lawyer, Bret Walker, on Thursday urged them to quash the conviction rather than order a retrial, saying it was the power and duty of this court.He also accused the prosecution of an inappropriate and over- engineered attempt at improvisation to make matters fit that wont fit. The defense has argued Pell would not have had the time or opportunity to molest the boys in the sacristy, which would have been a hive of activity after Mass.Judges pressed prosecutor Kerri Judd on many of her arguments, including when she suggested the time it would have taken Pell to abuse the boys was not precise or clockwork, despite lower courts previously hearing the offending took place in a five-to-six minute period. In stark contrast to Wednesdays hearing, when Walker was largely able to speak uninterrupted, the judges grilled the prosecutor at length.University of Melbourne law professor Jeremy Gans said the questioning was notable for being mostly directed at arguments that support Pells argument for acquittal and were not particularly sympathetic to the prosecution. Its always difficult to know why they ask those questions but, to the extent that you can read anything into those questions, every single judge at some point was asking questions that seemed to be indicating a possible view of acquittal, he told reporters outside the courtroom.The case relied solely on the testimony of Pells surviving victim, as the other who is not known to have ever spoken of the abuse -- died of a drug overdose in 2014. Neither man can be identified for legal reasons. It has proved highly divisive in Australia, attracting protesters and supporters on Thursday to the High Court in Canberra, where they carried rival signs that read Criminal Pell pedophile icon and We love you, Cardinal George Pell and genuine victims. Local media reported a Melbourne man was charged Wednesday with threatening to kill Pell and making a bomb threat.Pell has been removed from top Church bodies by the Vatican but remains in the priesthood. The Vatican previously said it would avoid launching an investigation into his conduct until after all legal avenues are exhausted.

"Paul is getting closer, but not ready yet," said Solskjaer. "He hasn't trained with the team yet but, by next week, he will be ready."
 With Martial and Marcus Rashford sidelined, Thursday's game could see Tahith Chong given the chance to impress in a week in which he signed a new contract until 2022, ending speculation over his future.
 Solskjaer is delighted the winger signed a new deal and hopes to see Angel Gomes follow suit.
 Gomes, 19, has only made six first-team appearances in 2019-20 and could leave for free at the end of the season.
 "We're very happy he can see his future here and we have a very good player here," Solskjaer said of Chong.

“People are probably more conservative in spending money,” Zaremberg said. “That may impact the macro economy in the long run.”
 But he suggested that “the diversity of California’s economy, which doesn’t exist in other states, is a significant factor in buffering a crisis like this.” Zaremberg said, for example, that in addition to tourism, technology and logistics, the state has a large agricultural industry.
 Still, Zaremberg said, “the level of uncertainty has ramped up in the last week. The general notion is, ‘Don’t panic.’ But every business should have a contingency plan based on the best-case scenario, the worst-case scenario and the most likely scenario — and how do you manage that.”
 In Southern California, where 1 in 9 jobs is tied to international trade through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the trade war had already taken a toll, UCLA’s Nickelsburg wrote, with a decline in the movement of goods. The signing of an initial trade agreement with China had lifted hopes for a revival, but “the outbreak of COVID-19 mitigates against any increase in goods movement until the last quarter of the year,” he said.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-SOUTH CAROLINAColleges cancel classes as SC reports 10th coronavirus caseCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The University of South Carolina is extending spring break by a week for students at its Columbia campus and moving to virtual instruction when students return because of the new coronavirus. The state's largest university cancelled classes until March 22. South Carolina State University, Coastal Carolina University and Furman University also are cancelling classes until March 22. Columbia officials announced Wednesday that the St. Patrick's Day Festival that brings up to 50,000 people downtown won't be held March 21. State health officials said a 10th case of COVID-19 in South Carolina was diagnosed Wednesday in Lancaster County. Officials say the latest case wasn't immediately linked to other cases and the person infected is in isolation at a hospital.AP-US-SEX-EDUCATION- LAWSUITState agrees to ignore law on gay relationships in sex edSouth Carolina education officials have agreed not to enforce part of their own state law that bans sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual ones — unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases. Civil rights groups last month sued the state, saying the law violated the U.S. Constitution. They also say it led to a hostile classroom climate that fostered bullying of students who aren't heterosexual. A federal judge on Wednesday signed a consent agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the state, in which both sides agree not to enforce the contentious requirement. State officials had no immediate comment.STATE BUDGET-SOUTH CAROLINASC House OKs extra money for roads, teachers and tax reliefCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The South Carolina House has passed the state's $10 billion budget, putting additional money into teacher salaries, roads, safety at state prisons and tax relief and rebates. The House finished work on the spending plan Wednesday, a day earlier than usual. The speed was especially surprising because lawmakers had an additional $1.8 billion to spend over the past year's budget. The spending plan does not include an across-the-board raise for state employees. Instead, agency leaders will decide how to dole out $42 million for extra pay. The House plan puts $100 million into rural roads, gives each teacher a $3,000 raise, allots $100 million for state prison safety and sets aside $248 million for tax relief and rebates.STATE BUDGET-SOUTH CAROLINAHouse rejects raises for all state workers; OKs $10B budgetCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The South Carolina House has rejected proposals to give across-the-board raises to state employees. The House approved the state's $10 billion budget Tuesday. The spending plan provides $42 million for state employees raises, but allows agency leaders to give them out as they wish. Democrats say that isn't fair and offered proposals for an across the board 5 % and 2.5% for state employees. Both were rejected by a vote of almost all the House's 80 Republicans. The budget does include a $3,000 raise for all teachers, and some Democrats warned state employees may feel especially shunned and take action.VIRUS OUTBREAK-SOUTH CAROLINACoronavirus cases up to 9 in SC after 2 more positive testsCAMDEN, S.C. (AP) — Two more people have tested positive for the new coronavirus in South Carolina,. State health officials said Tuesday that both people are connected to the original case of a woman in Camden. South Carolina now has nine people diagnosed with COVID-19. Two of the cases have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while federal testing on the other seven are pending. Seven of the cases are in and around Camden, a city of about 7,200 people about 40 miles northeast of Columbia. Health officials say the latest two positive tests were “household contacts" with the initial woman diagnosed on Friday and both people remain in the hospital.PUBLIC UTILITY SALESenators working fast on changes at SC state utilityCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina senators are wasting little time in bringing together their plan to remake state owned utility Santee Cooper. A subcommittee spent about an hour Tuesday creating a framework of what they wanted in a reform bill. Senate Finance Committee staffers and lawyers then spent several hours to write those suggestions into a bill and the full Finance Committee approved it Tuesday afternoon. The House is working on its own Santee Cooper reforms. Both the House and Senate want to fire the current Santee Cooper board that they blame for approving a minority stake in two nuclear reactors that were halted during construction, leaving Santee Cooper with $4 billion in debt.
