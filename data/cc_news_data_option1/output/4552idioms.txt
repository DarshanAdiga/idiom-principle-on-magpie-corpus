Un dolore insopportabile per Vincenzo, che da quel momento aveva perso il sorriso. Alcuni mesi fa, i Carabinieri lo avevano fermato appena in tempo nei pressi di un ponte, intenzionato a togliersi la vita. Affidato a suo padre, il ragazzo aveva nuovamente cercato di compiere il tragico gesto lanciandosi dal balcone della sua abitazione. Anche in questo caso, si era riusciti a bloccarlo. Ma oggi, sfortunatamente, nessuno è riuscito a fermarlo in tempo per evitare la tragedia.

At the time of my youth, today’s opportunities for socioeconomic advancement were nonexistent for Black people.
 For all but a few, college attendance was out of the question because of finances and racial discrimination.
 If you were not admitted to the Black colleges of Lincoln University or Cheyney State College, forget about college.
 I do not know of any student of my 1954 class at Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin High School who attended college. Though the quality of education at Benjamin Franklin is a mere shadow of its past, today roughly 17% of its graduating class has been admitted to college.
 The true hope for a youngster graduating from high school during the 1950s was a well-paying and steady job. My first well-paying job was as a taxi driver for Yellow Cab Company.
 Younger Black people today have no idea of and have not experienced the poverty and discrimination of earlier generations. Also, the problems today’s Black people face have little or nothing to do with poverty and discrimination.
 Political hustlers like to blame poverty and racism while ignoring the fact that poverty and racism were much greater yesteryear but there was not nearly the same amount of chaos.
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate among Blacks in 1940 was about 11%; today, it is 75%. Black female-headed households were just 18% of households in 1950, as opposed to about 68% today.

Thai police on Sunday fired water cannon on pro-democracy protesters who were trying to march to the royal palace to deliver demands for reform to the unassailable monarchy.
 Student-led rallies have rocked the kingdom since July, with protesters calling for the removal of Premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha -- a former army chief who came into power through a 2014 coup -- and a rewrite to the military- scripted constitution.
 The boldest in the leaderless movement have also demanded reforms to the monarchy -- a once-taboo issue -- sending shockwaves through Thailand's arch- royalist establishment.
 On Sunday, some 5,000 protesters attempted to march from Bangkok's historic Democracy Monument to the Grand Palace to deliver letters to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, as the police warned them to stop.
 As the marchers got closer, police fired water cannon at them. The protesters reacted angrily, shouting: "Why did you use the water cannons against us?"
 Authorities had warned earlier in the day that protesters were banned from breaching a 150-metre radius around the palace, and some 9,000 officials were deployed.
 Sunday's confrontation was the second time police used water cannon against protesters.
 Last month, a peaceful rally in downtown Bangkok saw protesters blasted with chemical-laced water as police bore down -- images that shocked many in Thailand.
 Before the march to the Grand Palace on Sunday, the rally at the Democracy Monument was peaceful with protesters chanting "Prayut, get out" and holding up a three-finger salute -- a symbol of the movement.
 They also threw flowers into a makeshift cardboard coffin carrying a life- sized mannequin with Prayut's face. Some scrawled messages on it, including "go to hell".
 Earlier Sunday, prominent pro-democracy figures called on the king to open dialogue with the protesters.
 "We hope you will change your behaviour once and for all and become a King of all people," wrote lawyer Anon Numpa, one of the most recognisable faces in the movement.
 "I hope Your Majesty will open your mind and reach out to dialogue with us to solve the crises together."
 The unprecedented demands to Thailand's ultra-wealthy monarch have infuriated pro-royalist groups, and they have retaliated with counter-rallies.
 On Sunday, a smaller group of the king's supporters came out to the Democracy Monument holding portraits of King Vajiralongkorn, but they left after they were outnumbered by the protesters.

With thrills and spills, these films offered female viewers bold new visions of themselves. They were, in other words, films for the new woman, a figure who beginning in the late 19th century would upend gender norms partly by venturing into a rapidly changing world of work, shopping, entertainment and derring-do.

Rise is much more sophisticated home system, a take on the suddenly popular urban vertical farming. It uses a pump to continuously circulate nutrient rich water and comes with a special waterproof handheld sensor probe that can measure Ph levels, temperature and more. Once a week you insert this probe into the water, and along with the app on your smartphone - which know exactly what plants you have chosen and where they are in the garden - it computes the amount of nutrients you need to add (from easily measured squeeze bottles). It has Wi-Fi, monitors the water level continuously for replenishment from plant absorption and evaporation, automates the lighting based on your plants, and even tells you when they are ideal for harvesting. More than just a garden, Rise is a complete high-tech indoor growing system, and it works great. Of course, the added capacity and complexity means it takes up more room, takes longer to assemble, and because you can hear the water circulating and the (bright) grow lights stay on up to 18 hours a day, it is ideally located out of sight, like the basement or garage. But I have mine in my home office and have gotten used to the zen garden-like water background noise, like having an aquarium. If you want any semblance of vegetable self-sufficiency this coming winter, you cannot beat Rise. You get more bang for your buck and floor space with a two or three level system than a single shelf, and models run $549-$949.

Thai pro-democracy protesters were confronted by riot police and water canons on Sunday as they tried to approach Bangkok’s Grand Palace to deliver letters about their political grievances addressed to the country’s king. The protesters had pushed aside a bus that was serving as a barrier to try to get closer to the palace, which houses the royal offices.They had met earlier at Bangkok&rsquo;s Democracy Monument and marched as darkness fell, pushing past an initial thin line of police. Police deployed the water canons for a short time and it was not clear if anyone was hurt in the chaos.Thailand&rsquo;s pro-democracy movement has been pushing a bold challenge to reform the monarchy with almost daily demonstrations.Sunday marked the second time water that water cannons have been used against them during several months of demonstrations.The student-led movement, which over several months has seized the political initiative, has put enough pressure on the government of prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to call for Parliament to deal with at least some of their demands. They are seeking Mr Prayuth&rsquo;s resignation, changes to the constitution to make it more democratic and reforms to the monarchy to make it more accountable.The protesters believe Mr Prayuth lacks legitimacy because he came to power after an election last year whose rules were set up under military rule.Mr Prayuth, as army chief in 2014, led a coup ousting an elected government and then headed the junta that ran the country until last year&rsquo;s polls.A new constitution was put into effect by the junta that the protesters also consider illegitimate and anti- democratic. The third demand, calling for reform of the monarchy, is the most controversial. The monarchy has traditionally been an untouchable institution, regarded by most Thais as the heart and soul of the nation. A lese majeste law mandates a prison term of up to 15 years for anyone who defames the king or his close family.Until the protesters raised the issue, public criticism of the royal institution was virtually unknown.While the protesters have increasingly put the monarchy issue front and centre, they have received serious pushback. Even the main opposition party, otherwise sympathetic to their other points, has said it does not want to amend laws covering the monarchy, and royalists have started holding counter-demonstrations.Parliament has agreed to debate amending the constitution and political leaders are discussing setting up a reconciliation committee, an effort that so far has been rejected by the protesters.But Mr Prayuth has insisted he will not step down, and any effort to reform the monarchy seems to be a dead end, leaving the situation deadlocked.

We asked the Massachusetts Department of Parks why its camp was largely empty. They didn’t respond. We kept calling and emailing until, nine days later, someone told us that they’d “had difficulties hiring seasonal employees.”
 Really?! This summer, Massachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in America. The state offers to pay workers up to $25 an hour, including benefits. Yet, they can’t find people who’d work outdoors in a beautiful place in the summer?
 Maurice’s Campground managed to hire enough staff. They have to because Maurice’s is privately owned. If they don’t please customers, then they can’t stay in business. “If there was no staff, we were the staff,” says owner John Gauthier.
 Gauthier innovates. Sometimes campers have helped clean the camp or staff the office. To save water, he charges customers 25 cents for six minutes in the shower. At the state camp, water is free; campers can waste all they want.
 The government bought the property in 2019 for $3.6 million. Last year, the camp’s revenue fell thousands short of its operating costs. Now it loses even more money because it’s largely empty.
 Such clear demonstrations of the difference between public and private are everywhere. But few people realize the reason why.
 Recently, _The New York Times_ published an op-ed by “Sex in the City” actress Cynthia Nixon about her dismay over seeing her kids’ public school’s “chaotic … and profoundly unsafe approach to reopening.” By contrast, her Netflix production company was totally ready.
 She’s become a politician, so she blames “underfunding.” She doesn’t mention that New York’s government-run schools spend more than $20,000 per student.
 Her production company was ready because it is private. The bosses spend their own money. Spend it well, and they profit. Spend it badly, and they’re out of work. That focuses the mind.
 Governments spend other people’s money. No one spends other people’s money as carefully as we spend our own.
 The owner of Maurice’s Campground tries harder, and because of that, he serves many more campers than the taxpayer-subsidized camp.
 “It’s kind of unfair,” I say to Gauthier. “You have to compete against the government, which is losing all this money.”
 He answers, “Yeah, it’s not a great scenario, but what can we do?”

WYTHEVILLE, Va. — When Cole and Patricia Bennett moved into their Withers Road home several years ago, the yard was dotted with ash trees.
 But not so much anymore, thanks to the emerald ash borer, which destroyed tree after tree, including Cole’s favorite specimen.
 “But Cole didn’t want to let go of it,” Patricia Bennett said. “We wondered what we could do with it, and then stumbled across this guy online.”
 The guy is Kris Connors from Nickelsville, an artist who specializes in custom sculptures out of wood and other materials like concrete, foam, clay and resin.
 For their ash tree trunk, the Bennetts requested that Connors sculpt a rainbow colored hot air balloon, a nod to Wytheville’s water tower and the Chautauqua hot air balloon show.

I liked the women’s prickly camaraderie, but I really liked how relentlessly physical they were. It is very satisfying, I discovered, to see its petite co- star Rosie Perez land punches, partly because of _Do the Right Thing_. In that film, she wears a flirty boxer outfit but also appears in a sex scene that made her feel so bad she wept while it was being shot. It was similarly gratifying to watch Robbie use her legs — which she’d been directed to open in _The Wolf of Wall Street_ for a man’s ogling — to turn herself into a circular saw. Harley’s grinning red mouth and playful lawlessness, her cartwheels of chaos, felt like a sly, unambiguously furious rejoinder to antediluvian ideas about women and the display of their bodies. _How you like me now?

 By law, hunters must “never shoot unless they are absolutely sure of their target and what lies beyond it,” the bulletin said.
 Shooting from a vehicle, or carrying a loaded firearm in or on a vehicle is prohibited, it added.
 Provincial conservation officers are conducting regular patrols, the bulletin said. Information about hunting violations, including abandoned animal carcasses, can be forward to a dedicated provincial tips line at1-877-847-7667.

“This is something positive. I like being a part of it and being a part of the community. The museum keeps the community and its history alive. I love being a part of all this history. The people behind the scenes are not hired staff but are much needed volunteers. We are looking for people who want to commit to being a part of this, first getting together and knocking around ideas. Just think about how much more we could do if we had more people. We need fresh faces, more ideas and more involvement. We want people to be aware that this group exists, and they are most welcome to be a part of it. And, remember, you do not have to live in Saltville to join the Friends group,” Venable said.

"My only problem is my life inside the hotel," Angelina Melnikova, who won silver at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, said before the meet. "I was surprised that I couldn't walk freely -- even inside the hotel. I wanted to have a tour of Tokyo. But it's impossible to do that this time. I totally understand." Japan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics, although a government audit last year said it was twice that much. All but $5.6 billion is public money. Over and above this, estimates suggest the postponement will cost another $2 billion to $3 billion. The University of Oxford published a study in September showing these are the most expensive Summer Olympics on record.

I liked the women’s prickly camaraderie, but I really liked how relentlessly physical they were. It is very satisfying, I discovered, to see its petite co- star Rosie Perez land punches, partly because of Do the Right Thing. In that film, she wears a flirty boxer outfit but also appears in a sex scene that made her feel so bad she wept while it was being shot. It was similarly gratifying to watch Robbie use her legs — which she’d been directed to open in The Wolf of Wall Street for a man’s ogling — to turn herself into a circular saw. Harley’s grinning red mouth and playful lawlessness, her cartwheels of chaos, felt like a sly, unambiguously furious rejoinder to antediluvian ideas about women and the display of their bodies. How you like me now? Boom, splat, ha-ha.

I love watching other women — actors and stunt performers, dancers and gymnasts, trick riders and trapeze artists — move on and off the screen. A woman with a great walk always gets my attention. At least some of my enjoyment probably has to do with my own lack of coordination; I’ve never been sporty and am not at all graceful. There is also just the delight and awe we derive from looking at the human body in glorious motion, whether it’s gymnast Katelyn Ohashi executing a series of flips or Harley Quinn clobbering a villain with a baseball bat. My brain lit up like the Fourth of July while watching Harley and her sisters.

In fact, from 1890 to 1940, the Black marriage rate was slightly higher than that of whites. Even during slavery, when marriage was forbidden, most Black children lived in biological two-parent families. In New York City, in 1925, 85% of Black households were two-parent households. A study of 1880 family structure in Philadelphia shows that three-quarters of Black families were two-parent households.
 There’s little protest against the horrible and dangerous conditions under which many poor and law-abiding Black people must live. It is not uncommon for 50 Black people to be shot over a weekend in Chicago — not by policemen but by other Black people.
 About 7,300 Black people are murdered each year, and not by white people or racist cops, but mostly by other Black people.
 These numbers almost make our history of victimization by racist lynching look like child’s play.
 The solutions to the many problems that Black Americans face must come from within our Black communities.
 They will not come from the political arena. Blacks hold high offices and dominate the politics in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans. Yet, these are the very cities with the nation’s worst-performing schools, highest crime rates, high illegitimacy rates, weak family structure and other forms of social pathology.
 I am not saying that Blacks having political power is the cause of these problems.
 What I am saying is that the solution to most of the major problems that confront Black people will not be found in the political arena or by electing more Blacks to high office.
 One important step is for Black Americans to stop being “useful tools” for the leftist, hate-America agenda. Many Black problems are exacerbated by guilt- ridden white people.
 Often, they accept behavior and standards from Black people that they would not begin to accept from white people.
 In that sense, white liberal guilt is a form of disrespect in their relationships with Black Americans. By the same token, Black people should stop exploiting the guilt of whites. Let us all keep in mind that history is one of those immutable facts of life.

Usually, I watch these videos because I’m reviewing the movie and want to see how certain scenes were executed — to see the training, sweat and cinematic sleights of hand in these high-flying tricks and blows. I’ve watched Emily Blunt soar and crash land to play a soldier in Edge of Tomorrow; performers transform into Amazons to populate Wonder Woman; Melissa McCarthy hang tough in Spy; and Charlize Theron kick butt, again and again, in Atomic Blonde.

Control of the US Senate is not likely to be decided until a January run-off in Georgia, even after Democrat Joe Biden won the White House on Saturday. That post-election cliff-hanger will determine the balance of power in Washington, as neither party appears to have a lock on a Senate majority right now.So far, the tally for the next Senate is 48 Republicans and 48 Democrats after Tuesday&rsquo;s election. Two seats in Georgia are headed to run-offs on January 5. And seats in North Carolina and Alaska are still too early to call.The stakes are high for a momentous political struggle in Georgia during President Donald Trump&rsquo;s final days in office.The state is closely divided, with Democrats making gains on Republicans, fuelled by a surge of new voters. But no Democrat has been elected senator in some 20 years. As much as 500 million dollars (£380 million) could be spent on the two races, one strategist said.&ldquo;Now we take Georgia, and then we change America,&rdquo; Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told a crowd celebrating Mr Biden&rsquo;s victory on the streets of Brooklyn.With a Democratic majority in the Senate, the party that also controls the House would have a firm grasp on power in Washington.Mr Biden would have latitude over nominees, including for his cabinet, and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through Congress. If Democrats fall short, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, could wield the power to check Mr Biden&rsquo;s ambitions.&ldquo;The Senate is the last line of defence,&rdquo; tweeted the National Republican Senatorial Committee as soon as the presidential race was called for Mr Biden. It was a fundraising appeal.Republicans have been working to retain their majority, but even if they secure the final two races where ballots are still being counted in North Carolina and Alaska, they would still fall short of the 51 seats needed.In North Carolina, Senator Thom Tillis is trying to fend off Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham in a tight race that is too early to call. Alaska GOP Senator Dan Sullivan is favoured for another term against Al Gross, an independent running as a Democrat.The political math problem for Republicans is that the vice president of the party holding the White House casts the tie- breaking vote in the Senate. Next year that would be vice president-elect Kamala Harris. That means 50 seats for Democrats would result in control over the chamber. But Republicans would need 51 seats to cement their hold on power. That would put Georgia centre stage, as many expect is about to happen.Both Senate seats in the state are now held by Republican incumbents. They were forced into the January run-off contests after no candidate reached the 50% threshold needed to win outright in multi-candidate races.GOP Senator Kelly Loeffler will face Rafael Warnock, a black pastor from the church where the Rev Martin Luther King, Jr preached. And Republican Senator David Perdue, a top Trump ally, will face Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff.&ldquo;Now more than ever, we NEED to keep the Senate in Republican hands,&rdquo; tweeted Ms Loeffler. She said on Saturday that she and Mr Perdue are &ldquo;the last line of defence against the radical left&rdquo;.Mr Ossoff&rsquo;s campaign aired a new ad, detailing a &ldquo;path to recovery&rdquo; from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. He calls for following the advice of medical experts to deal with the virus and a massive infrastructure plan to create jobs.&ldquo;We need leaders who bring us together to get this done,&rdquo; Mr Ossoff says in the ad.Mr Biden had been quiet on the Senate balance as he awaited the results in his own election, but he offered a preview before Tuesday&rsquo;s election.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate. There&rsquo;s no state more consequential than Georgia in that fight,&rdquo; Mr Biden declared at an Atlanta rally on October 27, when he campaigned alongside Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock.Republicans agree. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on the line in Georgia,&rdquo; said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, the outside group aligned with Mr McConnell that spent big trying keep Senate control.House speaker Nancy Pelosi reminded her colleagues of the stakes for the entire party during the sprint ahead.&ldquo;How we conduct it in the next two months will affect how we do in Georgia,&rdquo; Ms Pelosi told House Democrats, according to a source. She reminded colleagues to be &ldquo;respectful&rdquo;.
