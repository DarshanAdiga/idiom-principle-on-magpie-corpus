If you fancy a 14-inch display, but need a laptop that can fold into a tablet, look no further than the Acer Spin 3 ($499 starting, $699 as tested). This rare breed of a 2-in-1 offers strong performance and long battery life. The machine also remains cool under pressure, and its top-firing speakers are well above average. However, there are a few turnoffs that could be deal breakers for some people. Namely, the laptop's display isn't very colorful and the plastic design is uninspired. But, if…

Shaphawn Adams business “Team Catering and Craft Services” has been a hot spot on various movie and TV show sets for years.
 “I moved to Atlanta almost 10 years ago from Michigan. My dad was already in the film industry working in the transportation department and the opportunity came up for craft services. My dad thought I would be perfect because I could cook,” said Adams.
 But with the world dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, her job has been turned into a virtual ghost town.
 “Because there’s no way to socially distance on a film set, like you’re too close, you were working very close quarters,” Adams said.
 Losing her source of income has been an adjustment not only economically but also personally.
 “I work with my crews 10, 14 hours a day. So I learn their diets, I learned likes or dislikes. I have certain days where I’m making fried chicken and that’ll brighten the whole set for the rest of the day. So when you’re working on a film set everybody becomes your family,” said Adams.

As many of self-isolate and practice social distancing, Adams is reaping a big reward she was unable to enjoy before the coronavirus.
 “Believe it or not I’m doing my first love. I’m actually being a mom. When you work in film and TV your life is not your own. We don’t work a normal 9 to 5 schedule,” said Adams.
 For her a key ingredient to coping with a crisis is remaining positive.
 “I’m able to be at home and wake up and make my kids three meals, and to be able to sit and help with home school, virtual learning at home and just kind of an at home mom is new for me. It’s an adjustment for me because I have not lived that life in a very long time but I am enjoying it,” she added.
 A global pandemic was not on the list of terrible things that could ruin her business. To soften the blow she focuses on her newfound happiness.
 “Because at the end of the day you can have all the money in the world you can have all the worldly possessions but if you don’t have your family you really don’t have anything," she said.
 Adams is waiting to see if she qualifies for the stimulus check and how much she will receive.
 Like many Americans she’s waiting for that check to come.

Allen Garfield, a character actor from New Jersey, has died from complications of the coronavirus disease, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which confirmed Garfield’s death with his sister.
 Garfield, a Newark native, was 80.
 Actress Ronee Blakley, who starred opposite Garfield in the 1975 Robert Altman movie “Nashville,” announced Garfield’s death on Facebook. Blakley said he died Tuesday from COVID-19.
 The actor, born Allen Goorwitz — a name he sometimes used in Hollywood instead of his stage name — was a graduate of Weequahic High School.
 Before pursuing an acting career, Garfield became a boxer, he told interviewer Skip E. Lowe in the ’80s, as a way of “keeping the gangs off me.” He also worked as a journalist for 10 years until he was 26, starting as a copy boy at The Star-Ledger in the ’50s before becoming a sportswriter and editor.
 “I thought I was either gonna be the first boxer-journalist, like a Hemingway character, I’d be like the Jewish Hemingway, right?" he told Lowe. “Box and also write about boxing.”
 But Garfield first caught the acting bug when he was a teen. He idolized comedian Lenny Bruce.
 Garfield later attended The Actors Studio in New York, where he was at first admitted as a writer and director, and studied under Lee Strasberg. He often played nervous and corrupt types in films, appearing in movies including Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 drama “The Conversation,” which was nominated for three Oscars, including best picture; “Cry Uncle," “Dick Tracy,” “The Stunt Man,” “The Candidate,” with Robert Redford, “The Stunt Man" and Roman Polanski’s “The Ninth Gate."

The Chinese city where the coronavirus epidemic first broke out, Wuhan, ended a two-month lockdown on Wednesday, allowing people to leave the city, if they were healthy, amid concerns of a second wave of infections as cases in mainland China rose. China sealed off the city of 11 million people in late January to stop the spread of the flu-like virus to other parts of the country. Over 50,000 people in Wuhan caught the virus, and more than 2,500 of them died, according to official figures. But restrictions have eased in recent days as new infections dropped to a trickle. Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, saw just three new confirmed infections in the past 21 days. Around 55,000 people are expected to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday. More than 10,000 travellers have left the city by plane so far as flights resume at Wuhan Tianhe airport. Flights to Beijing and international locations have not been restored. I’m very happy, I’m going home today,” migrant worker Liu Xiaomin told Reuters as she stood with her suitcases inside Wuhan’s Hankou railway station, bound for Xiangyang city. Wuhan residents have also been urged not to leave their neighbourhood, their city and even the province unless absolutely necessary. People from Wuhan arriving in the Chinese capital will have to undergo two rounds of testing for the virus. China maintains strict screening protocols, concerned about any resurgence in domestic transmissions due to virus carriers who exhibit no symptoms and infected travellers arriving from overseas. IMPORTED CASES Asymptomatic patients and imported infections have become China`s chief concern. Mainland China`s new coronavirus cases doubled in 24 hours as the number of infected overseas travellers surged, and new asymptomatic infections more than quadrupled. New confirmed cases rose to 62 on Tuesday from 32 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, the highest since March 25. New imported infections accounted for 59 of the cases. The number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 137 from 30 a day earlier, the health authority said on Wednesday, with incoming travellers accounting for 102 of the latest batch. Chinese authorities do not count asymptomatic cases as part of its tally of confirmed coronavirus infections until patients show symptoms such as a fever or a cough. As of Tuesday, 1,095 asymptomatic patients were under medical observation in China, with 358 of them travellers arriving from abroad. To stem infections from outside its borders, China has slashed the number of international flights and denied entry to virtually all foreigners. It also started testing all international arrivals for the virus this month. Screening of travellers arriving overland was also recently tightened. As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,802, including 3,333 fatalities, the National Health Commission said.
