  # Phillips County hit hard by coronavirus, 97 new cases in state


  Phil Drake


  Great Falls Tribune


  There were 97 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and two deaths reported early Tuesday in the state, with 27 of those occurring in Phillips County which up until recently had no COVID-19 incidents at all.


  Phillips County, which has a population of about 4,000, now has 55 confirmed cases, with none of those listed as recovered. The Phillips County Health Department said Tuesday that eight of those cases have recovered, but were not reflected on the state map.


  And Gov. Bullock said Tuesday $50 million will be directed to increase child care options for Montana families and bolster the state’s child care infrastructure in response to COVID-19.


  The money is from the Coronavirus Relief Fund and will be used to provide in- home care for families with special circumstances and to maintain and expand child care for children 0 to 5 as well as school-age children.


  Montana now has 5,104 confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to covid19.mt.gov. Of those, 3,542 people have recovered and 1,485 are active. There are 77 people hospitalized out of 276 hospitalizations.


  The state has administered 194,492 tests, which is 1,007 more than what was reported Monday.


  Big Horn County health officials confirmed the death of a 70-year-old man on Monday, the Associated Press reported. Lewis and Clark County health officials confirmed the death of a county resident on Tuesday, but they released no further information.


  Mineral County reported its first two cases, leaving Carter and Petroleum counties as the last two of Montana’s 56 counties without a confirmed report of the respiratory illness.


  Phillips County Health Department posted Aug. 4 on its Facebook page that it had five confirmed cases of COVID-19, the county’s first. It said the people were told to remain isolated at home until they have fully recovered.

  It had 28 active cases by Aug. 8 and by Monday evening that total grew to 52. It said Monday the health department would be closed for the rest of the week but would still be available by phone.


  A worker at the health department declined comment Tuesday morning, noting the Facebook page had information posted. A spokeswoman for the Fort Belknap Indian Community said health authorities are monitoring the situation and they working with Phillips County in coordinating efforts.


  Other counties reported new totals as well.


  Yellowstone County had 21, Big Horn had 10 and Flathead, Lewis and Clark and Silver Bow had five each.


  Cascade, Dawson, Lake and Valley had three each. Two each were reported in Carbon, McCone and Mineral counties. Blaine, Gallatin, Glacier, Granite, Hill and Roosevelt reported one each.


  Blaine County's newest case was a male under 19. Glacier County's newest report was a woman in her 20s. Hill County's new case was a female under 9 and Cascade County's three new cases involved a man and woman in their 40s and a male under 19.


  Cascade County how has 56 active cases, 108 recoveries and four deaths, according to covid19.mt.gov. Glacier County now has 14 active cases, 62 recoveries and one death. Hill County has one active case, 40 recoveries and two deaths. Blaine County lists zero active cases and 11 recoveries.


  NorthWestern Energy officials said Monday they will resume service disconnections for the “small percentage of accounts with past due balances who have not responded to multiple requests to contact us to make payment arrangements.".


  The utility voluntarily stopped service disconnections for non-payment in March to help customers financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.


  It warned Monday that crooks are likely to use the end of the temporary moratorium on service disconnections to scam or steal money from Montanans.


  Bullock, in his announcement Tuesday about $50 million for child care services, said $30 million of that will be grants to maintain and expand child care for school-age children during out-of-school time. Applications for this portion of the funding will be available online at covidrelief.mt.gov beginning Aug. 19.


  He said there will be $10 million for families with special circumstances requiring in-home care. Applications will be available online on the DPHHS Child Care Resource and Referral Agency (CCR&R;) website page beginning on August 19.


  Bullock said $8 million will be made available for supplemental payments to all licensed and registered childcare facilities to maintain and expand child care slots. These payments will start being processed Sept.1. He also said $2 million will be be available for CCR&R; agencies for administration and outreach.


  Bullock issued a directive July 15, making masks mandatory in certain indoor spaces and at some outdoor activities in Montana counties with four or more active cases, effective immediately.


  On Thursday he issued a directive giving counties the option of holding voting by mail in the November general election, adding it was unlikely the pandemic will have abated by then.


  Bullock also said he will direct up to $20 million to the Montana University System to help its COVID-19 efforts for testing students in the fall semester.


  The state updates its covid19.mt.gov website about 10 a.m. daily.
