As far as other cinema chains, it's unclear they will follow suit. It's possible that other movie theater circuits will balk at Universal's new definition of a theatrical window and refuse to play the studio's films. However, this does ensure that the studio will have hundreds of locations at its disposal because AMC is the nation's largest theater chain. AMC's main competitor, Cineworld, the owner of Regal, was adamant that it would not sign similar deals with studios.

The surge in U.S. coronavirus cases and the restrictions aimed at containing it have begun to weigh on the economic recovery, the head of the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, pointing to an apparent pullback by consumers and a slowdown in the rehiring of furloughed workers, particularly by small businesses.
 “We have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference following release of the U.S. central bank’s latest policy statement.
 The United States “has entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both our health and our economy.”
 Powell’s comments, made via videoconference, confirmed what many economists and other analysts have maintained in recent weeks as coronavirus infections exploded in a number of southern and southwestern states, dimming hopes for a quick economic rebound.
 The Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday directly tied the economic recovery to resolution of a health crisis whose direction remains much in doubt. More than 150,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
 “The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,” the central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said.
 In his news conference, Powell elaborated on just how much remained unclear about the direction of the world’s largest economy. Fiscal programs that he credits with sustaining consumer spending in recent weeks are about to expire, with debate still underway in Congress over what, if anything, will take their place.
 The virus is moving so fast that policymakers are taking cues about the economy from real-time flows of data from firms that track people’s movements through cellphones, for example, or provide signals about hiring, Powell said.
 “That data show that on balance ... the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since cases began that spike,” he said.
 The Fed held policy largely steady at its two-day policy meeting this week, with key decisions likely to come this fall after it is clearer where the health crisis is heading and how forcefully Congress does or does not add to the support available for struggling businesses and unemployed workers.
 Fed policymakers repeated a pledge to use their “full range of tools” to support the economy and keep interest rates near zero for as long as it takes to recover from the fallout from the epidemic, saying the economic path will depend significantly on the course of the virus.
 “Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year,” the Fed said in its statement on Wednesday.
 All FOMC members voted to leave the target range for short-term interest rates at between 0% and 0.25%, where it has been since March 15 when the virus was beginning to hit the nation.
 “The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,” the statement said.
 U.S. stocks added to gains after the Fed’s statement, while longer-term U.S. Treasury yields moved slightly higher. The dollar fell to a two-year low against a basket of currencies.
 “The most notable thing is the statement that the path of the economy will depend on COVID-19. The Fed is putting health again front and center in its statement, which is impactful and meaningful,” said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.
 “It’s a bit ominous, to be frank. We know that this virus is unpredictable. That sentence shows the primacy of COVID-19 in their outlook and the uncertainty of their outlook because of it.”
 ## No change for now
 Fed officials had been expected to spend some of their meeting debating whether and how to strengthen their so-called forward guidance, perhaps by promising there would be no changes to interest rates until the unemployment and inflation rates meet explicit benchmarks.
 The policy statement on Wednesday gave no hint of such a change, which many Fed analysts expect won’t come until the September meeting.
 The Fed also said it will continue to buy at least $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to steady financial markets.
 It renewed its low-rate vow a day ahead of a government report expected to show a record 34% drop in annualized economic output last quarter, when authorities imposed lockdowns that closed businesses and kept people home in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
 Fed policymakers had hoped those measures would help contain the virus, allowing the economy to bounce back quickly, even as they fretted over the possibility that infections could resurge and blunt the economic recovery.
 The U.S. central bank has rolled out nearly a dozen new lending and credit programs to fight the economic fallout from the epidemic. But the immediate outlook hinges largely on where infections go from here and how much more fiscal support lawmakers deliver in the meantime.
 Since their last policy meeting in June, the epidemic has intensified, with an average of around 65,000 new cases detected each day, about three times the pace of new infections in mid-June. The rise in COVID-19 deaths has prompted governors from California to Florida to impose new economic restrictions.
 Job growth, which had been unexpectedly strong in May and June, now appears to be slowing, and consumer confidence has taken a hit.
 Meanwhile, government aid that kept millions of unemployed Americans spending will drop sharply at the end of this week unless Congress agrees on a new relief package. Republicans are split over whether to support $1 trillion in new spending, and Democrats want a figure closer to the $3 trillion Congress has already committed to fight the crisis.
 Small businesses, a mainstay of the U.S. economy, are also increasingly facing a breaking point as government grants run dry and payments come due.

In the short run, however, AMC's competitors are proceeding with caution. The theater chain has reached out to the other major studios to offer them slightly different terms from what Universal has agreed to, but has yet to find any takers. Universal is believed to be getting more generous terms because it made the deal first. Under its proposal to other studios, AMC would receive 20% of gross revenue from the rentals. It would also have to pay 2% less for each film it distributes from a particular studio. That means that if the theater chain and a studio split the box office returns, AMC's take would be 52%, netting it millions of dollars on top titles. In return for being able to release their films on-demand earlier, studios would have to contribute an additional $2 million annually for marketing.

On Friday July 24, surrounded by his beloved wife and children, George Frederickson of Lawrence, Kansas peacefully returned to his heavenly home, one week after his 86th birthday.   George Frederickson was born July 17, 1934 in Twin Falls Idaho, the son of Jack and Zelpha Richins Frederickson. As part of a large, loving family, George and all his siblings worked hand-in-hand with their parents to support the family drive-in and Frederickson's Fine Candy and Ice Cream. The hard work was balanced by lots of fun, and as an Idaho boy through and through, George loved hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers. George had many friends and loved the social aspects of school. According to his mother, he never made a friend he didn't keep; this would include his best and lifetime friend Clark Whitehead. But initially George did not show too much promise as a scholar, often getting kicked out of class for joking or talking. Teachers frequently sent the unruly boy to the library as punishment. Bored, and desperate for entertainment, he began reading books to pass the time. Exposure to the world of ideas contained in books, intended as punishment, sparked in George a love of learning that changed the course of his life forever.   After two years at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, George served a mission in South Africa for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Two years of witnessing apartheid first-hand profoundly influenced George's worldview and informed his subsequent research on social justice and equity.   Shortly after returning to BYU George met and fell in love with Mary Williams, a nursing student from Pioche, Nevada. Once engaged, Mary waited for him to complete his Army basic training before they were married in the St. George, Utah Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in March 1958. George graduated the following year and they were off to Los Angeles, where George earned an MPA (UCLA) and PhD (USC). By the time George accepted his first teaching job at the University of Maryland Mary and George had started their family. They headed out to the east coast with their young sons Thomas and Christian, and Lynne was born soon after they arrived in Maryland.   George's career took the growing family to New York, where David was born, and then to North Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and Washington state. During these years George took the family on many camping trips, zig-zagging the country from Mt. Katahdin in Maine to the Olympic Peninsula, from the beaches of South Carolina to the mountains of New Mexico. The Frederickson children are all fearless travelers who know their US geography, with their parents to thank for this.   After the children had grown, George and Mary made a new life together in Lawrence Kansas. Their children all had families of their own, and George and Mary enjoyed many visits from grandchildren over the years. Nothing gave George more joy than to gather his expanding family together for holidays, and the entire family sincerely looked forward to being under one roof for week- long reunions in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, northern Michigan, or western Maryland. Never far from his Idaho roots, and shooting things, family vacations always included model rockets and homemade potato guns.   George and Mary loved theater. They enjoyed trips to New York to see Broadway shows and treasured their annual visit to the Utah Shakespeare Festival with George's cousins Ron and Jan and their spouses. George and Mary also enjoyed theater in Kansas City at the New Theater and the Quality Hill Playhouse. Always an admirer of Alexander Hamilton's role in our country's founding, George was an early and devoted fan of the musical Hamilton, and it gave him great pleasure to watch it twice in the week before he died.   George's career allowed George and Mary to travel extensively, and visiting professorships allowed them to live abroad for a time in Oxford, England and in Shanghai, China.   In the early years of his teaching and research career, George held faculty positions at the University of Maryland and Syracuse University. In pursuit of a just cause, George could be something of a rabble-rouser. In his first academic job George took a stand against the unethical actions of senior faculty. A few years later he and some colleagues took on an entire academic discipline, demanding a shift toward relevance, responsiveness, and equity.   In addition to his public administration scholarship, George excelled as a university executive, as the founding Associate Dean of Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs and the Dean of the University of Missouri's School of Community Affairs. At 42 George was appointed President of Eastern Washington State College in Cheney, a position he would hold for 10 years. Under George's innovative and dynamic leadership, and in the face of considerable resistance, the college transitioned into a thriving regional university, with a name change to Eastern Washington University with campuses in Cheney and Spokane. George's tenure also included the creation of Schools of Health Sciences, Public Affairs, and Mathematical Sciences & Technology, and numerous relevant graduate and undergraduate degrees and programs. The university also improved Eastern Washington as a cultural, arts and science hub, expanding the influence of the school well into Washington's Inland Empire community. With an eye to the future, George shored up the legacy of the school by establishing the EWU Foundation. And always focused on attracting positive attention and increasing the impact of the university, George transitioned athletics from competition exclusively with other small schools to admission into the NCAA and membership in the Big Sky and other major athletic conferences. These changes were not without their detractors at the time, but in the years since George's presidency, the Eastern Eagles' large fan base has enjoyed much success in athletics, with two NCAA Basketball Tournament appearances and 13 NCAA Football Division 1 FCS Tournament appearances. George was especially thrilled to attend the 2010 National Football Championship, and it was a sweet victory for him to watch his beloved Eagles win it all.   George returned to full-time scholarship when he was appointed the Edwin O. Steen Distinguished Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas. While at KU George founded and edited the prestigious Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory. Although George retired from KU in 2012, he continued to write and visit his office on campus daily until this year. George loved his errands and meeting his friends for lunch, and he stopped for ice cream so frequently at Silas and Maddie's that they awarded him a lifetime supply of free ice cream cones.   Over a long and distinguished career, George was frequently recognized for his achievements. Not merely items for George's curriculum vitae, these honors were a reflection of meaningful and lasting contributions in scholarship and civic engagement. As a young scholar he served as President of the American Society for Public Administration and was selected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. He actively served in these organizations for several decades. The latter part of his career included awards reflecting a lifetime of impact on public administration scholarship. Never one to miss an opportunity to positively influence a field he cared about deeply, he used the speeches that always accompanied these awards to shift public administration research toward greater responsiveness and equity. Perhaps the professional accomplishment of which he was proudest are the many dozens of scholars around the world who count George as a mentor.   George published hundreds of scholarly articles and dozens of books in his 50-year career. Never shying away from controversy, he veered off the academic path in 2018, when his lifelong interest in collegiate athletics led him write Hot Tickets, a book about the KU Basketball ticket scandal. Despite increasing health difficulties, he was able to complete and publish the book last year.   George was preceded in death by his parents John (Jack) and Zelpha Frederickson, his brothers Bryan, Richard and Robert, sister Alice Brown, brother-in-law Larry Shupe, sisters-in-law Virgean and Bernice, stepmother Bonnie, and stepbrother Garey Stimpson. George is survived by his dear wife Mary, his children Thomas (Leslie), Christian (Jenny), Lynne, and David (Julie), grandchildren Joseph (Mercy), Sarah, Samuel, Ellen (Alex Gillie), Cami (Paul Touloukian), Kasie Cloud, Brett, Jake, Geoffrey Williams, Brian Rago, Evan Rago, Matthew, Michael, Carter, and Jacob, great-grandchildren Ramona, Hugh, and Edmund, brothers John (Annette), Kent (Sharon), Grant (Valeta), Dennis (Kathy), sister Jean Ann Shupe, sisters-in-law Barbara and Arletta, brother-in-law Lloyd Brown, stepsister Mary Thrall, and many cousins, nieces, and nephews.   George will be buried Tuesday in Lawrence Kansas in a small graveside service. George's family looks forward to celebrating his life next spring at a memorial service open to all family, friends, and colleagues.   The family suggests memorials in George's name go to the H. George and Mary Frederickson Fellowship at the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas, or to the Eastern Washington University Foundation. All memorials may be sent in care of Warren McElwain Mortuary, 120 W. 13th Street, Lawrence, Kansas, 66044.   For more information or to post a condolence go to warrenmcelwain.com.

I am inclined to accept with trepidation the opinion by Roberts that our political office-bearers should without interference be entrusted with the “safety and the health of the people”, and also holding on to a thin thread that they are ethical and accountable enough to safeguard and protect the interest of South Africans. If you read closely the opinion of Roberts, it conveys the message of separation of powers and that courts have a constitutional duty to defer to democratically accountable officials during a historic public health crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.

Several weeks ago, Debra Cloer, a member of our Morganton Writers Group, published an article for The News Herald in our “Burke County Notebook” column, reminding us of the beauty and value of trees.
 This story plunged me into a memory from my preschool years of the smell of fresh-cut pine trees. My dad had sawed down the trees and sent them to a timber mill to be made into lumber for the house in which I would live with my mom, dad, brothers and sister. Dad had bought some acreage in the middle of a 10,000-acre forest, located above the town of Connelly Springs. The scent of the rosin exuding from the fallen pine trees tickled my sense of smell and left a lasting impression on me for the love of trees. The memory was stamped into my brain as my little brother and I climbed around on the framework of the house being built by our father and a friend of his.

"The characters represent a lot of people's issues in real life," Tom tells Radio 1 Newsbeat ahead of the release of the show's second series.
 It sees the seven heroes accidentally stranded in 1960s Texas with only 10 days to stop a nuclear apocalypse.
 Before they get to the small matter of saving the world, though, they've got to get to grips with a racist and homophobic society.
 "There's a lot of people in certain demographics that have these struggles and we represent them and then, on top of that, we've got to think about being a superhero," Tom says.
 "That's the problem in their life, their main issue is that they've got to be superheroes and that's why I fell in love with the script in the first place because, fundamentally, it's about them as people."

According to a number of sources, this was a belief shared by the Venezuelans in the camps, and by the other former US soldier, Airan Berry. But it was false.
 By March 2020, the operation still had no solid financial backing. And although the two Americans had joined the mission, up to 20 of the Venezuelans had left. Some had found camp life too onerous, others feared the whole enterprise had been infiltrated by Maduro loyalists. Then things started to go very wrong.
 On 23 March, the Colombian authorities seized a lorryload of military gear, including assault rifles. Three days later the US Department of Justice indicted Gen Cliver Alcala, accusing him of narco-terrorism, and put a $10m price on his head. He gave himself up after taking to social media to declare the captured arms the property of the Venezuelan people "within the framework of the agreement made by President Juan Guaido, J J Rendon and US advisers" - a reference to the contract Guaido's commission said had been dead in the water for months.
 Hernan Aleman told the BBC he smelt a rat. Alcala was indicted, he thought "so that our action - the operation - would fail".
 Several sources have suggested both the Colombian and US authorities became jittery about the camps. They thought if Alcala was removed, the men in training would disperse. But they stayed. And with Alcala gone, Antonio Sequea - a former captain in the National Guard, who had worked in counter- intelligence at the highest levels inside Venezuela - assumed leadership of the operation. So where was Jordan Goudreau? Not in Colombia…

The ceasefire between AMC and Universal is surprising because for a long time, exhibitors have argued that shortening the window will cannibalize their business. They believe it will encourage consumers to avoid theaters, no matter how compelling a new release may be, in favor of waiting a few weeks to stream it in their homes. But AMC has bargained that this was a risk it had to take and it will be compensated for its willingness to take the plunge, according to insiders. The theater chain could earn as much as 10% of the revenue from any film that Universal puts on premium video on-demand. In return, Universal has the option to make any film it distributes available for rent three weeks after it debuts in AMC's theaters. The studio has to charge a minimum of $19.99 for the rental, which lasts 48 hours.
